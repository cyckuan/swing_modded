QUESTIONS REMAIN ABOUT WHY BABY DIED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GORDY HOLT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In January 1998, a 3-day-old Port Angeles, Wash., baby died
abruptly, and still, nobody knows why.
</P>
<P>
   Medical investigators were never sent to interview the parents
of the baby, Conor Shamus McInnerney, nor was a forensic
pathologist brought in to perform the autopsy. Instead, a hospital
pathologist in private practice did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's like sending a general surgeon in to do brain
surgery,'' said the pathologist, Joel Ziebarth. Neither he nor a
partner is trained in the procedures that forensic pathology
requires to prepare medical evidence for disclosure in court, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, nevertheless, a doctor in the case, Port Angeles
pediatrician Eugene Turner, stood accused of suffocating the infant
and faced a second-degree murder charge.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Reay, King County's just-retired chief medical examiner,
said no one knows what a forensic examination might have found _ a
chemical imbalance, incomplete nervous-system circuitry, an injury
or maybe nothing at all _ but now no one will ever know.
</P>
<P>
   As the physician in charge the night Conor died, Turner is the
one who called off resuscitation efforts after he, the Olympic
Memorial Hospital emergency-room staff and paramedics were unable
to revive Conor.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor admitted to a serious mistake made more than an hour
after he declared the boy dead. He placed his hand over the baby's
nose and mouth to pinch off what he described as the agonal gasps
of a body in the final throes of death.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said he intended it as an act of compassion. But the act
triggered a complaint from nurses, which fueled a state medical
board investigation and led to the murder charge by Clallam County
Prosecutor David Bruneau nearly eight months later.
</P>
<P>
   While that charge was subsequently reviewed in another county
and in January was dropped, Turner still could face a civil claim
by the baby's parents. No such claim has been filed.
</P>
<P>
   And while last month the state medical board stopped short of
stripping Turner of his license to practice medicine, it did place
an official censure in his file.
</P>
<P>
   Questions nevertheless remain about why the baby died, and
Clallam County is being reproached for mishandling the medical
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also wonder why the county prosecuting attorney's office
still handles the duties of coroner and why the death investigation
budget is not larger.
</P>
<P>
   Gaps in the medical investigation first came to light in June at
a medical hearing to determine if the doctor should lose his
license.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying via videotape before the state Medical Quality
Assurance Commission and in a separate interview later, King
County's Reay said the baby's autopsy record was sorely deficient.
</P>
<P>
   The former chief examiner said his review of the record showed
that X-rays were not taken; the baby's spinal cord was never
examined, and tissues and bodily fluids were never scrutinized
microscopically. Such tests are routine in King County, and should
be everywhere, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``An infant died,'' Reay said. ``It's unexplained. The record is
incomplete.''
</P>
<P>
   Ziebarth, the private pathologist who did the autopsy, would not
discuss his work on the infant. But he did say the cases he and a
partner typically accept from Clallam County ``are not cases we
feel would involve criminal conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Also routine in King County, according to Reay, would have been
next-day attempts by specially trained medical investigators to
reconstruct what happened that night at the baby's home. But that,
too, was not done for the McInnerney baby.
</P>
<P>
   Always difficult, such interviews are important to clear the air
if nothing else, Reay said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a child dies like this without apparent cause, you have
to think dirty,'' Reay said. ``You have to be suspicious, or you
can miss an awful lot. You must always think the worst before you
back away.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, all that is known about Conor McInnerney's death is
that his heart stopped beating, and he quit breathing while nursing
at his mother's breast at home.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, experts who testified on both sides of the case at
Turner's medical-board hearing cited biological and chemical
evidence to support the conclusion that Conor died at home _
possibly as much as an hour before paramedics arrived _ but none
could say why.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic question that remains,'' said Reay, ``is, what was
the underlying pathology that caused this child's death not what
happened at that hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the county's death-investigation system itself comes under
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Bruneau, who was determined to prosecute Turner after an
eight-month criminal investigation, tried to win a fifth term in
November but was defeated at the polls by Sequim attorney
Christopher Shea. Bruneau has since moved to Colville, where he was
hired as assistant prosecuting attorney for Stevens County. He did
not respond to requests for comment on this story.
</P>
<P>
   Bruneau's successor, on the other hand, said he is uncomfortable
with Reay's criticism and the gaps in the case that Reay revealed.
Shea also is uncomfortable with a quirk in the law that continues
to force his office to handle coroner duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at this 19th-century setup, and I'm wondering why
it isn't time for a more sophisticated system,'' Shea said. ``What
strikes me is, who are we as coroners? We're not doctors, we're
lawyers. So there's nobody here with the appropriate medical
skills, and that worries me.''
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, prosecutors have to be lawyers and medical
examiners like King County's Reay must be physicians certified in
forensic pathology.
</P>
<P>
   Those who campaign for a separate coroner's office, however,
need only know how to get elected, and those who do may or may not
choose to hire experts when they're needed.
</P>
<P>
   As constituted, Clallam County's 2-for-1 office saves taxpayers
an estimated $100,000 or more a year in salary and expenses, no
small amount at a time when their economy, once thriving on timber
and fish, isn't what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Clallam County stretches nearly 100 miles along the Strait of
Juan de Fuca east from the Pacific Ocean. Most of it _ 93 percent _
is federally controlled park or forest land or is state-managed or
commercial forest land. Today's unemployment rate is 7.3 percent,
nearly double the 4.3 percent average statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring coroners and other medical investigators see Clallam
County's prosecutor/coroner system as a magnet for continued
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   As an item in the prosecutor's $1 million budget, for example,
coroner duties were earmarked for just $18,000 this year, half of
what it was in the years from 1990 to 1993 and only a fraction of
what counties of similar size and smaller set aside for death
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   That's ``just asking for trouble,'' said San Juan County
Prosecutor Randall Gaylord who, like Shea, also wears two hats.
</P>
<P>
   San Juan County, he said, budgets $15,000 for death
investigations, but San Juan has a population of just 12,400
compared to Clallam's 66,400. In Eastern Washington's Grant County,
with a similar population at 69,400, Coroner Peggy Silbey said her
budget is $179,000, and she described the Clallam County situation
as ``woefully shortsighted.''
</P>
<P>
   Island County (Whidbey Island and Camano Island) also has a
population only a few thousand greater than Clallam County's
(70,300). But Island budgets $150,000 for death investigations,
according to Robert Bishop, the elected coroner. In Mason County
(population 48,300) $137,000 is earmarked for death inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Mason County Coroner Martha Reed said the disparity among county
systems and budgets underscores the need for hard state standards
or a way to harden newly developing national guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Training is available,'' she said, ``but it's not required.''
</P>
<P>
   Although state law does require separate officials for counties
with populations greater than 40,000, Clallam County's system slips
past that line because the voters want it to. In 1976 voters
elected to adopt a ``home rule charter'' that permits locally
contrived rules, and since then they have kept coroner duties
wedded to the prosecuting attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   If the Conor McInnerney case suggests it is time for a change,
so be it, said Clallam County Commissioner Martha Ireland of
Sequim. Her mind is open. ``If this is now a new concern,'' she
said, `I hope we can learn from it.''

TEEN'S DEATH MAY LEAD TO TESTS OF OLDER DRIVERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ROBERT MONROE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mark Mitock's 15-year-old daughter was hit and
killed by a 96-year-old motorist, who stopped but was unable to
understand what had happened and continued on his way to the dry
cleaner's shop.
</P>
<P>
   Mitock's grieving has never ended, and the Woodland Hills man
has campaigned for a law that would stiffen regulation of drivers
75 and older. Senate Bill 335, which would require road tests for
drivers after they turn 75, will come before the Assembly
Transportation Committee one week from today.
</P>
<P>
   State records show that California motorists continue driving
into their 80s and 90s, and Mitock says that makes the bill a vital
protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel this is the beginning of something very, very
frightening,'' Mitock said in an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   A car driven by Byron Cox killed Brandi Joy Mitock in a Santa
Monica intersection on Nov. 5. Cox suffered a major stroke the day
after the death, and physicians determined that he had sustained a
series of smaller strokes sometime before his car hit the
teen-ager, said his attorney Karen Filipi.
</P>
<P>
   He pleaded no contest to felony hit-and-run charges and was
fined $5,000 and placed on probation. Cox was allowed to pay the
fine into a fund supporting the bill, Filipi said.
</P>
<P>
   Brandi's father has made a circuit of policymakers' offices and
centers for senior citizens since state Sen. Tom Hayden, D-Los
Angeles, introduced SB335 in February. The Senate passed it in
June.
</P>
<P>
   To Mitock, the issue is one of common sense and responsibility.
To opponents of the legislation, it is an arbitrary proposal
ignoring highway safety improvements and variations in how people
age.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Retired Persons opposes the bill,
arguing that it amounts to age discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that triggers it is achieving a certain
birthday,'' said Helen Savage, the AARP's state legislative
representative. ``People do not age identically.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayden's bill would reduce the periods licenses are valid for
drivers 75 and older, and they would be required to pass
behind-the-wheel tests every time they apply for license renewal.
Drivers 90 and older would have to take the road tests annually.
</P>
<P>
   Now drivers 70 and older must renew their licenses in person and
take written and vision tests.
</P>
<P>
   Mitock said the premise of the bill is that motor skills and
reaction ability deteriorate as people age. Hayden said 75 was
chosen as the action-triggering age because that is when at-fault
and fatal crashes spike upward, according to DMV statistics.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 968,000 drivers older than 75 in
California, but there is no estimate of how many of them might lose
their licenses because of the tests the bill would require.

TRAGEDY HAS TRANSFOMRED MAYOR INTO PIPELINE-SAFETY CRUSADER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Growing up in Bellingham, Wash., Mark Asmundson was
only dimly aware that a pipeline went through town, and throughout
his years on the City Council and then as mayor, not much changed.
</P>
<P>
   But Asmundson did know the King family, and the Woods, and the
Tsiorvases.
</P>
<P>
   So Asmundson, who was traveling in Russia at the time, was
heartbroken when he received an urgent fax from City Hall,
informing him that each of those families had lost a son in the
June 10 oil-pipeline explosion in Bellingham, a city about 90 miles
north of Seattle, in Whatcom County.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Asmundson's job as mayor has been transformed. He
has been attending funerals, holding meetings and hiring two
environmental lawyers _ one of whom represented Alaska in the Exxon
Valdez case _ to make sure Bellingham knows how much it can demand
from The Olympic Pipe Line Co.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he was in Washington, D.C., lobbying for pipeline
reform. And Asmundson says he'll be back: He expects to make
pipeline reform a major crusade and is encouraging his constituents
to turn their anger into involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more informed I become about pipeline-safety issues, the
more nervous I become about pipeline safety,'' Asmundson said in an
interview. ``It's just good luck that these pipelines are not
blowing up homes and burning up kids every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Asmundson, 48, has been in politics much of his life. A
Bellingham native, he was the student body president at Bellingham
High School, where he graduated in 1969. After going to college,
managing a ski lodge and graduating from law school, he was elected
to the City Council in 1985. Ten years later _ after voters angry
about property rights had kicked him off the council _ he was
elected mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Asmundson considers himself a Democrat, but his office is
non-partisan, and his issues have been the basic staples of local
government, such as growth management and water-quality protection.
He runs a mid-sized city _ Bellingham has 64,000 residents and an
annual budget of about $175 million _ and had rarely thought about
what might lie under those warning signs marking the rights of way
for two interstate pipelines running through the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know what products went through them,'' he said.
``Five or six years ago the Kulshan Middle School was built 30 feet
from a pipeline. Knowing what people know now, that would never
occur again. But it just was not something people thought about.''
</P>
<P>
   Suffering a dramatic tragedy in his community has opened doors
in D.C. for Asmundson. He met not only with both of Washington
state's senators and six of the seven House members representing
Western Washington but also with several Democratic congressmen
concerned about pipeline safety, the staffs of committees with
jurisdiction over pipeline safety, the National Transportation
Safety Board and the Office of Pipeline Safety.
</P>
<P>
   Asmundson's message this trip is simple: He wants Bellingham
officials to be consulted before Congress renews the nation's
pipeline safety laws next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My basic message is this: The federal government has taken
complete control of the regulation of the safety of pipelines and
along with that goes a significant responsibility,'' Asmundson
said, referring to the fact that the federal government bans states
from imposing stricter regulations on pipeline safety. ``I want
members of Congress and the administration to understand that out
of sight is often out of mind, and it is not within the purview of
the average citizen to monitor the quality of the physical
conditions of pipelines. ... The public does not maintain constant
vigilance over things that are buried below the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Asmundson is planning to try to form a coalition with other
local officials from states that have had pipeline accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put this in the category of enlightened self-interest,'' he
said of his involvement in a federal battle. ``This pipeline that
goes through Bellingham is part of a very complex system, and it
needs to be safe up and down the pipeline to be safe here. We need
to have long-term assurance that the safety standards applied
nationally are sufficient to provide protection here.''

CLINTON TRIES TO ENLIST GOVERNORS IN BUDGET BATTLE WITH CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Subs 18th graf to correct spelling of Sen. Don Nickles'
name.) 
 (rm) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE and MICHAEL JANOFSKY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ President Clinton warned the nation's governors
Sunday that the Republican tax cut would force drastic cutbacks in
many programs that could hurt states, including Medicare, veterans'
benefits, farm programs, support for immigration and mineral
leasing payments.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, who has vowed to veto the $792-billion tax cut
passed by the Republican-led Congress, used a low-key,
nonconfrontational appearance here to cajole the National
Governors' Association into siding with him in this fall's budget
battles _ not an impossible task, given the governors' fears that
congressional Republicans will raid state budgets, including
unclaimed welfare money, to pay for the tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   As the president talked to the governors about their ``common
vision,'' his goal, aides said, was to build support to put
pressure on Congress and pave the way for a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that election-year politics might intercede and
prevent a compromise, Clinton said, was ``dead wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not nearly as pessimistic as a lot of people are about
the prospects of our reaching an agreement, and I am determined to
try to do it,'' he said, striking a conciliatory tone with a group
he once headed as governor of Arkansas and whose members he
identifies with closely.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used many of his powers of persuasion to suggest that
the governors' interests were more in line with his own than they
were with those of the Republican Congress. He referred approvingly
to Sen. George Voinovich of Ohio and Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine,
both Republicans, for voting against the tax cut, noting that they
did so because of their familiarity with a governor's
responsibilities. Voinovich is a former governor and Ms. Snowe is
married to a former governor, John McKernan.
</P>
<P>
   Adding a new argument to its reasons to veto the tax cut, the
White House said Sunday that under current budget laws the tax
reductions would trigger automatic, across-the-board cuts in
spending on social programs, including Medicare. Mr. Clinton has
insisted that he cannot accept tax cuts of more than $300 billion
over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that if Clinton signed the tax bill in the form
that the House and Senate passed it, without offsetting spending
reductions or revenue increases, the budget laws would require cuts
in several categories of spending, including veterans' programs,
farm credit and crop insurance and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare would have to be cut by $2 billion in 2000, and by $9.2
billion, or 4 percent, in 2002, according to a study by the White
House budget office. Over the next five years, the study said,
Medicare would have to be cut $32 billion.
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, Clinton worked the room slowly, steeping
himself in conversations with individual governors. He had a warm
chat with Gov. Jesse Ventura, the independent from Minnesota, a
former wrestler with whom he talked at length about wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the governors said afterward that the president's
approach was effective, if not persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He left the door wide open for a compromise on tax cuts,''
said Gov. John Engler, R-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Engler said he believed the president was not trying to drive a
wedge between the governors and Congress. ``He's too sophisticated
for that,'' Engler said. ``He was trying to be positioned well in
the debate, and I thought it was a very artful talk. His skills
have always been significant in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, governors who listened to the president's speech
were divided along party lines. Republicans were not buying his
arguments against a big tax cut. Democrats said his reasoning made
perfect sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very effective, very smooth, and he certainly made a
strong argument,'' said Gov. Tommy Thompson, R-Wis. ``But I still
disagree with his conclusion that we can't afford a tax cut at this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he believed he spoke for ``the vast majority'' of
Republican governors, adding, `'It's hard to believe any of them
would not support the position I advocate. We have a chance for a
major tax cut. If not now, when? If we can't do it now, we will
never get the ability to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis of California, who last November became the
first Democrat in 16 years to be elected governor of the state,
said Clinton ``hit a home run'' and suggested that some of his
Republican colleagues might actually agree with him.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura promised to keep an open mind about the size of tax cuts
until he familiarized himself with details of the congressional
action and the administration alternative. He said he listened
closely to Clinton's remarks, as well as to the speech that
preceded it by Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., who criticized an array
of administration programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I venture out and make an opinion, I want to study both
proposals,'' Ventura said. ``With all I've had to do in Minnesota,
I haven't had time to focus on federal tax cuts. I don't want to
make any judgments based on two speeches.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used part of his speech to urge the governors to do more
to provide medical coverage for children from low-income families.
He said that about 10 million children had no health insurance and,
noting that states would get extra money from settlements in
tobacco cases, said it ``can be used for preventing youth smoking
but also for expanding health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House had put the governors on notice that Clinton
would press the issue, but some Republican governors said they did
not understand why. Since the Children's Health Insurance Program
began in 1997, giving states billions of dollars and wide latitude
to implement programs, about 1.3 million children have been
enrolled. Clinton pressed them to do more, even though many states
have made significant strides in drawing more children into the
program in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's absolutely wrong,'' Thompson said of Clinton's
belief that the states are not doing enough. Gov. Jim Geringer of
Wyoming, another Republican, said it was pure ``chutzpah.''
</P>
<P>
   So why would Clinton tweak the governors on the issue? Thompson
said he did not know until he perused a chart showing how many
children the states have added to the program over the last six
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it,'' he said, pointing to Texas, which was the only
state showing a drop in enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, one of a handful of governors who
was not attending the governors' meeting, is the leading Republican
presidential candidate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In New York, John Signor, a spokesman for the New York State
Department of Health, said the state had been a model for other
states in providing the new benefits to children. Federal officials
have agreed in the past, saying that indeed as many as 30 percent
of all children nationwide benefiting from the program are in New
York. That fact makes the national figures look better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dwarf any other state in terms of the number of kids we
have in the program or in the amount of state support that we give
to the program,'' Signor said. ``Under Governor Pataki's
leadership, this program has flourished and New York state is a
national leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Signor said that the state provides about $200 million for the
program compared with about $250 million from the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   But New York has not done so well in another area on Clinton's
agenda, providing Medicaid benefits to poor people as they leave
the welfare rolls. The number of people in New York on Medicaid has
dropped 9 percent since Clinton signed the welfare law three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   State health officials have conceded that something is wrong,
and in January a federal district judge ruled that New York City
had improperly denied applications for Medicaid from needy
individuals on the grounds that they had failed to comply with the
work requirements of the city's welfare program.

COWBOYS COACH WON'T BE FIXATED ON SCORE, BROWNS HOOPLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANTON, Ohio _ Cowboys coach Chan Gailey expects a circus-like
atmosphere for tonight's preseason opener against the expansion
Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   With the backdrop of the annual Pro Football Hall of Fame Game
and the national stage of ``Monday Night Football'', Gailey knows
what to expect from the Browns, who are playing in their first game
since Art Modell moved the original team to Baltimore in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey believes a pumped-up Browns team will undoubtedly be
motivated to put on a good show for their football-starved fans,
including the raucous ``Dawg Pound.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for the Cowboys is to not get caught up in the
hoopla and remain focused on their goals _ and winning is not at
the top of the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``They \Rthe Browns\S will treat it more seriously,'' Gailey
said. ``I can't control them. We'd like to win, but that's not the
No. 1 thing we are trying to accomplish. We are on our own agenda.
What they do doesn't affect us. We will play according to what we
think we need.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Cowboys need is to get live-action assessments of
several rookies and young players expected to play major roles this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the list of players to watch are rookie defensive end
Ebenezer Ekuban, the team's top draft pick; second-year defensive
tackle Michael Myers, who is replacing the suspended Leon Lett in
the starting lineup; and second-year free safety Izell Reese, who
is battling George Teague for the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran starters such as quarterback Troy Aikman, receiver
Michael Irvin and running back Emmitt Smith will play one or two
series at the most in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``These games are the younger players,'' Irvin said. ``It's more
important for the coaches to find out who they can and can't count
on among the younger guys. I don't know if Troy needs to play a
whole lot for Chan to understand what he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys will also focus on several young players who are
vying for backup roles and roster spots, including defensive
tackles Darren Benson and Nate Davis, rookie defensive end Peppi
Zellner, linebackers Dat Nguyen, Robert Thomas and Darren Hambrick,
receivers Wane McGarity and Jeff Ogden and rookie offensive guard
Solomon Page, who is in the starting lineup because of a host of
early camp injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said preseason games are where you find out what is real
and what is fake as far as practice performances go.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of veterans, defensive end Alonzo Spellman and
linebacker Quentin Coryatt, also figure into the live-action
evaluation because they are both coming off yearlong layoffs and
need as much as work as they can to get rid of some rustiness.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, Gailey would have also liked to focus on some group
aspects of the game _ like four wide-receiver sets and the
communication in the secondary and on the offensive line. However,
he said that type of evaluation against the Browns was rendered
moot by the rash of early training-camp injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys will play without their top four cornerbacks. Deion
Sanders (toe) and Charlie Williams (forearm) are sidelined by
precamp injuries. Kevin Smith (back) and Kevin Mathis (back) have
been hobbled in the past week, likely putting rookie Duane
Hawthorne and Zebbie Lethridge in the starting lineup tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the top four receivers are injured as well _ Raghib
Ismail (shoulder) and Ernie Mills (hamstring) for a week or so and
James McKnight (knee) for the season. Ogden will start opposite
Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the injuries, this will be more of individual game
than groups, sections or sides of the balls,'' Gailey said. ``We
are looking at individuals to see how they play in context of
offense, defense and special teams. And find out if what I see on
the practice field holds up in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said the specter of the occasion is an added bonus for
him because he'll get to see how the young players react in the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Ekuban, expected to contribute immediately in the defensive-end
rotation, is looking forward to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be an exciting moment playing the Browns in Canton in
the Hall of Fame Game on ``Monday Night Football'','' Ekuban said.
``It's a chance for all of us young players to showcase our talents
and put on a good show for the coaches. it will definitely be a
memorable experience.''

BROWNS' COUCH TO TAKE FIRST PRO EXAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEREA, Ohio _ Rookie Cleveland Browns quarterback Tim Couch has
a $48 million contract, recently became engaged to] his longtime
girlfriend, and has a whole bunch of football trading cards to
sign. Yet the game attached to his fame isn't quite ready for prime
time.
</P>
<P>
   After missing an open wide receiver in practice last week, Couch
had this conversation with coach Chris Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer: ``Hey, didn't you see the Z?''
</P>
<P>
   Couch: ``Uh, I forgot the play.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer: ``I guess you don't want me to sleep at nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Couch: ``I couldn't lie to you.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked later about Couch's mental development at the most
demanding position in football, Palmer said this about the
exchange: ``That's a typical routine for a rookie. He was so proud
of getting \Rthe offensive line\S in the right protection, and then
he just kind of went blank on what the play was really going to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it has gone with the 6-foot-4, 227-pound Couch
this summer in his transition from college to pro quarterback. The
player taken with the first pick in the NFL draft last April can be
brilliant one minute, able to hit a wide receiver 60 yards
downfield on the dead run; bumbling the next, throwing left when
the play he called in the huddle was meant to go right.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no one should be surprised. Nine other quarterbacks have
been selected No. 1 in the NFL draft since the AFL-NFL merger in
1970. And each one _ Terry Bradshaw, Jim Plunkett, Steve
Bartkowski, John Elway, Vinny Testaverde, Troy Aikman, Jeff George,
Drew Bledsoe and Peyton Manning _ had considerable growing pains
their rookie seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Like the nine before him, Couch was drafted to eventually start.
But his day has not come yet. Journeyman quarterback Ty Detmer, who
is on his fourth team in eight NFL seasons, will start and play the
first 12 to 15 plays against the Cowboys tonight in the Pro
Football Hall of Fame Game in Canton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Couch will come off the bench some time in the second quarter.
And in the coming weeks, Couch will unseat Detmer as the starter
and begin writing a new chapter in the Browns' history of
quarterbacks, which includes Otto Graham, Brian Sipe, and Bernie
Kosar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, it's no secret _ they drafted Tim to be the guy for the
future,'' Detmer said. ``...I'm supposed to be the backup here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about the past No. 1s, the Aikmans, the Elways, and I
realize the expectations and the pressures of being a No. 1 pick,''
Couch said. ``But I've just got to be myself and do what got me to
that point of being a first pick.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll have to start with getting the plays down. When he set
every meaningful passing record at the University of Kentucky, he
did so without a playbook. ``We had a right and a left,'' he joked,
``Coach \RHal\S Mumme would draw stuff up on the board and we'd
just learn them in practice.'' Here, the Browns' playbook is four
inches thick.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a lot to learn,'' Couch said. ``But I'm getting it
down.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also trying to get down how much faster the action is in
the pros than it was in college. He talked to Manning a few weeks
before camp, and the Colts quarterback tried to warn him of the
differences in the pro and college games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can really see it in the running game,'' Couch said. ``You
hand the ball off, look back and you see a big hole open up. It
looks like the play is going to go for 40 yards. Then, bam!
Somebody makes the play at the line of scrimmage.''
</P>
<P>
   There were questions about Couch's arm when he was drafted. But
Palmer said Couch's arm is strong enough to throw any pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was dropping back to pass the other day, and he falls flat
on his rear end,'' Palmer said. ``He's sitting on the ground and in
one smooth motion he throws a hitch outside. As a coach, I'm ready
to yell, `Hey, you don't do that in the NFL.' Then I said to
myself, `That was a pretty impressive throw for a guy that doesn't
have a strong arm.'
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the guy is a playmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   A nationally televised audience will begin to see the
possibilities for themselves tonight.

COLLINS HOLDS IN FRUSTRATIONS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Terry Collins recently stood among a group of
reporters in the Anaheim Angels' dugout and asked them a peculiar
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is anybody else having trouble sleeping lately?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   No, Terry. Just you. After all, you're the one managing a
major-league club that was expected to contend for a division title
but instead has fallen out of the race and into last place.
</P>
<P>
   You're the one that has had to piece together your lineup all
season because of injuries to key players.
</P>
<P>
   You're the one that faced a clubhouse divided over your contract
extension.
</P>
<P>
   And you're the one that had to answer the same questions after
each loss during an 11-game losing streak, the longest in the big
leagues this season.
</P>
<P>
   Collins isn't the type to go home after a loss and kick the dog
or punch a hole in the wall. But it might not be such a bad thing
if he were able to release his frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hold it in, and that's never been good,'' Collins said.
``When I go home after the game's over, there's no such thing as
leaving it here at the ballpark. I'm not going over the game we
just played, but I'm trying to figure out what to do to make
tomorrow more successful.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly the reason why Angels general manager Bill Bavasi
quickly dismissed the players' concerns about Collins and extended
his contract for two more seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Collins is as competitive as they come, so losing isn't
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to win probably as much as anybody I've ever seen,''
said Angels third-base coach Larry Bowa. ``He's kept his cool
through all the frustrating times and lets the players know he's
positive. But it's a tough time. We had high expectations. Terry
takes it very personal. He cares, and he doesn't just leave it
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It eats at him. He tries to mask it the best he can. He's very
competitive and there are nights he doesn't sleep. He's never been
through this as a manager. He's been successful his whole career as
a manager.''
</P>
<P>
   In Collins' five previous big league seasons as a manager --
three with Houston and two with the Angels -- he had five winning
seasons. However, he had no playoff appearances, either. In all
five seasons his teams finished in second place.
</P>
<P>
   ``All winter I heard crap about `You finished second again,'''
Collins said. ``Well, how would it feel if we were in second right
now?''
</P>
<P>
   It might feel better than last place, but it still wouldn't be
good enough for Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels like we all feel,'' Angels closer Troy Percival said.
``He's out there every day with us. He takes it home like every one
of us. If you had a manager that handled this well, you wouldn't
want him here.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't the first time Collins has found himself trying to
piece together an injury-riddled roster. In 1984, his second year
as the Dodgers' triple-A manager in Albuquerque, things got a
little crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an outstanding team,'' said Collins, who managed the
Dukes from 1983-88. ``We had so many injuries at the end of the
year, Dave Wallace, my pitching coach, was pitching and I was
playing second base and shortstop.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he isn't playing anymore, Collins practically lives
at the ballpark. It's surprising he doesn't have a cot in his
office. He often arrives before noon for a 7:05 p.m. game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only so many minutes in a day that are mine,'' he
explained. ``It's why I get here so early, so I have time that is
mine. The phone isn't ringing, there aren't people coming in and
out. It gives me time to work out and put together that night's
lineup. I'm giving myself my space, which everybody has to have.''
</P>
<P>
   While it all may seem like Collins is a poster child for stress
management, he doesn't want anybody feeling sorry for him. Save
your pity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody forced me into this job, so you'd better be ready for
the tough times,'' he said. ``Because it's a tough game. It can
humble you in a hurry. ... When I got into this is as a manager, I
gave myself a time frame. I said, `I'll give all I got for as long
as I can.' When it becomes work, it's time to get out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through all the stuff we've been through this year, I like
those guys (players). I respect them. I respect all they have to do
to play at this level. It's not always going to go good and
sometimes everybody thinks they have all the answers, but I enjoy
coming here every day, trying to win every game.''
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, things will get better for Collins and the
Angels. It may be too late this year for it to make a difference,
but Collins won't settle for less than the best -- from himself or
his players.

DIPLOMA MILLS THRIVE ON NET 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are you hoping for ``a prosperous future, money earning power,
and the admiration of all''?
</P>
<P>
   If so, you might be interested in obtaining a diploma from a
``prestigious'' university _ especially one that involves ``no
required tests, classes, books or interviews.''
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, you can get your diploma in only a few days, and
``no one is turned down.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no joke. It's an example of what one educator calls the
``new age of diploma mills on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of Palmers Green, which even its own registrar
described as ``a diploma mill'' based in London, is offering
diplomas on the Internet for a mere $1,400.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody seems sure whether it's legal, but some officials fear
that such fake credentials may be effective.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Crow, executive director of the North Central Association
of Colleges and Schools, said the Internet is ``a rich seedbed''
for questionable enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're in for a new age of diploma mills on the
Internet,'' Crow said. ``Anybody can throw these things up
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the same thing as setting up a physical place and
putting your shingle out _ where folks actually see you and can
find out if you have legal authority to operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing to stop people from doing some fast, hard
business on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Palmers Green, a bachelor's degree costs
$1,400, minus $500 if you sign up today. A second degree costs
$450. A third degree runs $400.
</P>
<P>
   Leave a message at a phone number with a New York City area
code, and a diploma could be yours in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We give you full credit for your work and life experience,''
said Lee Karo, the registrar. ``We give you your diploma,
transcripts, recommendation letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people we deal with are highly qualified, but for
whatever reason it isn't practical for them to complete their
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The diploma really just gets you in the door (with an
employer). You have to be qualified to do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Karo declined to give any information about the university's
owners. He referred a reporter to another number, where the person
who answered said he didn't know anything about the university.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Thackeray, special counsel for technology crime at the
Arizona Attorney General's Office, said law enforcement authorities
are still sorting out the jurisdictional complications of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Although state statutes may reach across geographic boundary
lines, enforcement is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to go find 'em,'' Thackeray said. ``You can often
find the guilty server, but not the people behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydney Davis, who oversees consumer fraud for the Attorney
General's Office, said state law prohibits her from commenting on
whether her division has received complaints about the University
of Palmers Green.
</P>
<P>
   In general, she said, advertisements for diploma mills must make
a misrepresentation or omission of fact to be regarded as
fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
   Thackeray added, ``It's legal to sell a certificate of nothing.
But if they are misleading people into thinking it will lead to
jobs, the same as a university degree, that might be illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   People who pass off phony degrees as legitimate to prospective
employers could be guilty of fraud or forgery, she noted.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Driggers, vice president for finance and administration at
the Greater Phoenix Economic Council, said employers are more
likely to check out an applicant's degree if he is coming straight
from school, with no work experience.
</P>
<P>
   More experienced job candidates are evaluated mainly by their
work history and references, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see something on a resume and you tend to believe it is
true rather than not true,'' Driggers said.
</P>
<P>
   Employment agencies do background checks that might reveal phony
claims, she said. And during interviews, Driggers said she and
other employers ask technical questions designed to reveal the
applicant's competency _ a strategy that works best in technical
fields such as accounting.
</P>
<P>
   Crow said people who buy a degree from a diploma mill
``shouldn't be surprised when they try to market it and it doesn't
get them anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The association frequently gets calls from prospective employers
wanting to know whether a school is accredited, Crow said.
Employers also consult the association's Web site, which lists
accredited institutions. &QL;

MOOSE-SIZE HEART WON'T LET COWBOYS' JOHNSTON FINISH ON SOUR NOTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ In your heart, which some have compared
to the massive motor of a Mack truck, you understand that nothing
lasts forever and that your days as a Dallas Cowboy are numbered.
</P>
<P>
   You, better than anyone, know that the familiar cries of
``Moooooooose!'' at Texas Stadium and around the NFL will soon be
only a distant and fading echo.
</P>
<P>
   This, you're the first to admit, could be the last training camp
for Daryl Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   That's OK, but you're here, dragging yourself through the waves
of Texas heat, not because you don't know how to say goodbye, but
because you just can't allow yourself to quit with the bitter taste
of regret so fresh in your mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates and friends have asked why you're even here, after all
that's happened over the past two years. Why, at 33, put yourself
through this torture? Why subject yourself to the aches and pains
and the sweltering heat when you could easily step from here into
the Dallas business world and never miss a beat?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, of course, lies in that massive heart that has
driven you to be the best from the moment the Cowboys selected you
in the second round of the '89 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd quit after last year,'' you tell people who ask, ``then
you walk away with a feeling that they beat you.''
</P>
<P>
   When you're name is Daryl Johnston, that's not something you can
stomach. You came back last year after that horrendous and
near-tragic neck injury in 1997, and coaches, teammates and fans
alike applauded your courage and your determination.
</P>
<P>
   But in your heart, you know that you didn't play to the level
you expected to play. The fullback was a forgotten position in Chan
Gailey's new offense (77 combined rushing and receiving yards for
the season). It was not the way you had envisioned your comeback.
</P>
<P>
   The positive was that you could feel yourself making solid
progress throughout the season. You were getting stronger. Your
weight was coming back. You were becoming more familiar with the
offense. All that combined to make you believe that with another
off-season of training, you could finally be back to where you were
before the herniated disk in your neck.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that tonight, in Canton, Ohio, you'll probably be
butting heads with Browns linebacker Chris Spielman, who had an
almost identical herniated disk two years ago as well. If anything,
his was even worse than yours _ he was actually completely
paralyzed for a few seconds while yours manifested in loss of
strength and mobility in your left arm and upper body.
</P>
<P>
   But there was never a doubt in your mind that you'd play again
this season, if the Cowboys would have you.
</P>
<P>
   There was some question about that during the off-season, and
that hurt deeply. Being exposed in the Cleveland expansion draft
was a shock, but that was just the tip of the problem. With your
role in the offense reduced, owner Jerry Jones felt a need to
reconstruct your contract.
</P>
<P>
   The way that it was handled, that no one came forward to talk to
you about all this until the morning of the expansion draft, was
the biggest disappointment of all. You even had agent Leigh
Steinberg looking around the league as you contemplated the
unthinkable: moving to another team.
</P>
<P>
   It took a meeting with Jones before your feelings were soothed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understood what he was trying to accomplish, and he
understood why I was disappointed,'' you would say later. ``It was
an important meeting to have because it cleared the air. I think
after that meeting we're basically back to the point where we were
beforehand.''
</P>
<P>
   The renegotiated contract cut your base pay from what would have
been $1.25 million this year to $400,000, but there's no
resentment. You're the first to say that you've already made more
money playing football than you ever dreamed you'd make.
</P>
<P>
   The events of the past year, however, have brought home the
reality that your football career is now on a year-to-year basis.
No more looking to finish out contracts and then beyond. From this
point, it's just one year at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The aches and pains of 10 NFL seasons sit heavy on those broad
shoulders that have brought such terror to linebackers around the
NFL. But the physical part you've always been able to take. The
mental and emotional strain has become just as demanding. You were
as wrung out as a dishrag by the time the season ended last year.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, you've decided you'll finish your career as a
Dallas Cowboy. You even talked to Tony Dorsett about the
difficulties of moving to another team late in your career. He
recommended you try to close it out the way you came in _ with a
star on your helmet. That's the only way you ever wanted it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage of your life, the idea of picking up and moving
your family to another city, just to prolong your playing career
for another year or two is just not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   And we are talking family. Wife, Diane, is expecting your first
child Jan. 23, 2000, NFC championship Sunday. It could be quite an
eventful day.
</P>
<P>
   The day you found out she was pregnant was one of the happiest
moments of your life, and you think about it every day now. How
will you do as a father? How will it impact your life?
</P>
<P>
   All you can do, you figure, is rely on what you've learned from
your own parents and then devour all you can read on the subject.
It's a scary thought, being a parent in today's society, but you'll
attack the problem head on.
</P>
<P>
   It's the only way the ``Moose'' knows how to play.

TEXAS A&AMP;M MAY BE READY TO GO FOR THE BIG PRIZE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time since joining the Big 12 Conference, Texas
A&AMP;M heads into a football season as the favorite to win the league
championship. As such, the Aggies figure to be the highest-ranked
conference team when The Associated Press' preseason
college-football poll is released Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   That makes them flagbearers for a league that has seen its
members win four national championships in the 1990s (three by
Nebraska, one by Colorado). Can the Aggies, who return 16 starters
from an 11-3 team, make a serious run at becoming the Big 12's
fifth team to capture college football's ultimate prize in this
decade?
</P>
<P>
   Coach R.C. Slocum welcomes his incoming freshmen today,,] with
the veterans scheduled to report Thursday. Slocum talked recently
about the defending Big 12 champs' hopes and expectations for 1999:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does this team have the personnel it takes to win a national
championship?
</P>
<P>
   A: In all honesty, that's hard for a coach to say. But I know
we've got eight starters back on offense and eight on defense, and
I feel good about all of those people. I think the defense can be
as good or better than last year, and the offense should be better.
We've got the best group of receivers we've had since I've been
here. At most positions, I feel very comfortable with these
players. The only position I don't know about is tight end. We lost
two talented players \Rboth to the NFL draft\S and need someone to
step forward.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A year ago, you knocked off teams ranked No. 1 (Kansas State)
and No. 2 (Nebraska) despite entering both games as double-digit
underdogs. Those stand as the two highest-ranked opponents an A&AMP;M
team has ever defeated. Given the high percentage of returning
starters, how much confidence can this team draw from those
breakthrough victories in 1998?
</P>
<P>
   A: Quite a bit, I think. Over time, you get to the point there
are some psychological things you have to get over. Until you get
it done, you have that monkey on your back. Those wins helped us
clear a hurdle. There seems to be a carryover from last season,
with the guys wanting to achieve more. That's natural. But you
don't automatically do better just because you have a lot of guys
returning from a strong team. The team chemistry last fall was the
best I've ever been around. I'll be anxious to see how this club
comes together.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The last time A&AMP;M players entered a season talking about a
national championship was 1995. That team lost its third game, at
Colorado, then failed to even win the Southwest Conference
championship. What did you learn that season that can help you in
1999?
</P>
<P>
   A: I felt I made a mistake in that Colorado game. The guys were
so tight, they could hardly respond. I didn't do a good job of
sensing that we weren't ready mentally to go out and play our best
game. We could have won that game by two touchdowns. But we weren't
over that mental hurdle yet. We were playing a good team on the
road, and we came out there and screwed it up.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Toward that end, what will be different when you travel to
Nebraska on Nov. 6 for what should be your most important road game
of the season?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we'll be able to go in with the mental frame of mind
to go out there and say, `Let's just play.' We have grown a little
bit in the last few years, which is a natural thing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've already declared this your best group of receivers in
your 11 seasons at A&AMP;M. Can quarterback Randy McCown throw well
enough to make use of all those weapons?
</P>
<P>
   A: Randy's capable of being a real good passer for us. I thought
he was better in the spring in his understanding and overall
abilities. He made great strides. Plus, if you have a guy who can
jump and make one-handed catches, all of a sudden, your stats look
a whole lot different.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Speaking of that type of guy, you've been raving about wide
receiver Bethel Johnson since he was working with the scout team
last fall. Now that he's eligible to play, how much of an impact do
you anticipate?
</P>
<P>
   A: If he'd been out there last fall, we wouldn't have struggled
throwing the ball early in the season, like we did. He's got
big-play potential, speed, excellent hands. In the spring, I'd see
a ball look like it was overthrown, then he'd hit another gear,
catch it and be in the end zone. He'll really help our passing
game. I'm anxious to see him in a ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With all this talent at wide receiver, will we see 40 passes
a game from the Aggies? Or will tailback Dante Hall still carry
enough to have a chance to break the 1,000-yard mark again this
season?
</P>
<P>
   A: We'll still run more than we throw. But I think we're making
progress and building to where we are a balanced offensive team.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How difficult will it be to replace Dat Nguyen, as both a
playmaker and emotional leader?
</P>
<P>
   A: We won't be as good as we were with Dat at that position
\Rinside linebacker\S. But we'll still have a good group of inside
linebackers. Cornelius Anthony is an excellent candidate for
all-star honors. He's already stepped up to provide some of Dat's
leadership, but he's not Dat Nguyen. We'll miss Dat.
</P>
<P>
   Q: McCown missed two games last season because of injuries,
including the Big 12 championship game. Your choices behind him are
a redshirt freshman (Vance Smith) and a freshman (Mark Farris) who
has spent the past five years playing minor-league baseball. How
does the backup quarterback spot look at this point?
</P>
<P>
   A: We like Vance Smith. He's got good size \R6-foot-5, 225
pounds\S, a strong arm and he's been in the program an extra year.
But I think Mark Farris has done an amazing job of getting back
into football. He just turned 24, so he's remarkably ahead of what
you'd expect from a true freshman because of his maturity. He
figures very strongly into the backup picture.
</P>
<P>
   Q: During the summer, quarterbacks coach Ray Dorr was found to
have ``Lou Gehrig's disease.'' How is his health status and what is
his prognosis?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ray has handled everything with tremendous courage and
character. He hasn't asked any quarter, does his job, worked the
summer camp, and carries on like nothing ever happened. I've told
him as long as you can physically do the job and want to do it,
you'll be our quarterbacks coach. No question, his situation brings
some reality into this whole thing. We don't know what course the
disease will take. But I admire how he's handled this.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Among the incoming freshmen, who are the guys likely to have
the biggest impact?
</P>
<P>
   A: \RDefensive lineman\S Ty Warren is 282 pounds and he can
move. I would say that going back to Sam Adams \R1991-93\S, we've
not had a defensive lineman with the physical talents that Ty
Warren has. And \Rrunning back\S Joe Weber played in high school at
225 pounds and averaged 8.2 yards per carry. He has thick thighs,
he's quick-footed, catches the ball, makes cuts and has another
gear when he gets in the open field. I think he's a special running
back.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you concerned that too much may be expected of this team?
</P>
<P>
   A: Every year, you want to do better and achieve more. And
that's where we are. If you look at last year and really analyze
it, we won some games that could have gone either way. So you don't
know if you'll be as good as last year. But if all goes well, we
can be as good as we were last year. We can be better.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are fans' projections of an undefeated season unrealistic?
</P>
<P>
   A: Fans, to a large degree, stay frustrated. They're looking for
a Utopia to the point where no one ever beats you. In modern-day
football, with scholarship limits, that doesn't happen any more.

YANKS SWEEP M'S OUT TO SEA AND WELL BELOW .500 MARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Like many of the 45,195 people at Safeco Field on
Sunday, Mariners manager Lou Piniella checked out early. The bats
stayed in the racks and the baselines went untouched when Piniella
was ejected for arguing balls and strikes in the seventh inning.
There were loud words, unidentified gestures and coaches acting as
offensive linemen, but nothing of great significance.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever was said, there seemed to be one message for the whole
scene: enough, already. By the time Paul Abbott walked his third
straight hitter in a 9-3 loss to the New York Yankees, there was
nothing left to see in the Mariners' lost weekend.
</P>
<P>
   No four-game series in Seattle has ever attracted more fans. And
few, perhaps, have been more deflating. The Mariners were swept in
the series, and are now five below .500.
</P>
<P>
   The M's have hit .206 over their past five games. Their earned
run average is 6.60. In the past five weeks, they have had a
winning streak of six and losing streaks of seven and five. New
York had something to do with the current slide, but not
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we need measuring sticks right now,'' said
catcher Dan Wilson. ``We're not playing very well right now, not
doing the little things, not doing what it takes to win. It doesn't
matter who's out in the field against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Piniella, ``If everything had gone right for us this
series, we could have won a couple of these games. We didn't, and
we've got to regroup. They're a world champion team for some reason
_ they can rest their team, they can do a lot of things. But
outside of (Saturday), we really didn't play all that well,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, a pitchers' duel between the Yankees' David Cone and the
Mariners' John Halama turned on one pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Through three innings, Halama (9-3) had thrown first-pitch
strikes to 10 of 11 hitters and allowed no runs. Two Yankees
reached with one out in the fourth, but with Halama, the last thing
that would happen in that situation is a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Halama had allowed seven homers prior to Sunday, six with the
bases empty. Since hitters become more aggressive with men on base,
Wilson explained, Halama counters by taking something off his
pitches. That's what he did against Scott Brosius, going with a
``good changeup,'' Halama said, on the first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees' third baseman popped it over the left-field
fence, giving his team a 3-0 lead and surprising Halama, his
catcher and his pitching coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was going out, because it was hit off the
end of the bat,'' Halama said. ``Dan didn't think it was going out,
neither did Stan (Williams). I thought by the way it was hit, it
wasn't going anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone (11-6) won for the first time since his perfect game, four
starts ago. Through six innings, he had allowed two walks and an
infield single, striking out nine. Consecutive singles knocked him
out in the seventh, but he threw 79 wicked strikes among his 118
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got late-breaking stuff,'' said first baseman Raul
Ibanez, who struck out twice in his first game against Cone, whose
assortment of pitches and deliveries can be baffling. ``He throws
sliders inside, sliders away, he cuts the ball in, sinks it, he's
got a split. He's pretty tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Cone, Halama was lifted in the seventh with a run in, a man
on and two outs. Paul Abbott _ who will start on Wednesday as Jeff
Fassero returns to relief _ walked two to load the bases, then
walked Tino Martinez to force in a run. That was when Piniella
started barking at home plate umpire Ted Barrett from the dugout.
He was gone by the time Brosius singled to give New York a 7-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them the Yankees were intimidating them,'' said
Piniella, who was ejected for the second time this season.
``(Barrett) didn't appreciate that very much. ... Cone was getting
those pitches, and our guy was not treated to the same luxury.''
</P>
<P>
   But Piniella and Abbott acknowledged that the pitcher's wildness
did not help him on the pitch to Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard for him to give it to me when I hadn't thrown that
many strikes,'' Abbott said. ``That was a pretty good pitch, but
the stage was set by me being wild in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Relievers Todd Williams and Steve Sinclair finished up, with
both newcomers allowing one run in one inning of work.

LUNN SECOND TO NONE 
</HEADLINE>
 CHALLENGE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUTTON, Mass. _ Sunday morning, she went out looking for birdies
and collected three within the first five holes. Mardi Lunn seemed
on her way to firing the round of 66 she said she needed to have a
chance at winning the areaWEB.com Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Australian's tee shot on No. 6 caromed off a tree, and
it appeared Lunn's dramatic run toward a first LPGA Tour victory
had taken a turn for the worse.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the white sphere landed in a playable spot just to the
right of the woods. Two shots later, it rested in the bottom of the
cup for par. They might as well have made the $120,000 first-place
check out to Lunn right there. No doubt it was her day.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old came to within one stroke of her goal with a
round of 67, then took her place in the winner's circle with a
total of 13-under-par 275.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought maybe this was meant to be my day, because that was
really the worst shot I hit all day,'' said Lunn about the tee shot
on No. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Following a third-round 71 Saturday that consisted of one birdie
and 17 pars, she finished Sunday with six birdies and one bogey en
route to her first Tour win since turning professional in 1994. It
was her fourth pro victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing. Obviously, it's a big relief,'' said Lunn. ``I
think not winning can start to grind on you after awhile. You just
have to keep hitting the greens and rolling in putts and hope that
it will happen one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Lunn's performance was one stroke better than that of her idol,
fellow Australian Jan Stephenson (276), who also shot a final-round
67.
</P>
<P>
   Her birdie putt on 18 would have forced a playoff if Lunn, who
played in her trio, had bogeyed the hole.
</P>
<P>
   But Lunn sealed the title with a 5-foot putt for par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the yardage and what shot I needed to hit,'' said Lunn,
who added that she took deep breaths on 17 and 18 to calm her
nerves. ``You just have to believe in yourself. I've hit that shot
a million times. I knew I could do it once more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I birdied the second and the third, I was hitting good shots
to the putt, and I felt I was going to make putts today,'' Lunn
added. ``(Saturday) I was hitting good putts and they just kept
lipping out. That was the key (Sunday): making a few putts early.''
</P>
<P>
   Australian Rachel Hetherington also fired a 67, taking third
place and giving the women from Down Under the top three finishes.
Afterward, Lunn and Stephenson called it quite a triumph,
considering the fact that Australian Karrie Webb, the hottest
player on the Tour, did not participate.
</P>
<P>
   Lunn took the lead after a 2-foot birdie putt on the ninth hole,
which put her at 11 under. Hetherington, who played in a trio ahead
of her, birdied 10 to tie Lunn at 11 under.
</P>
<P>
   But Lunn then birdied 10 with another 2-foot putt to go 12
under, and she maintained her lead the remainder of the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Mardi get off to a good start, and that's what you have
to do,'' said Lorie Kane, who bogeyed two of her first three holes
to fail in her attempt to win her first LPGA event. ``Mardi's been
knocking on the door the last couple of weeks. She's a very patient
individual.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lunn admitted to being nervous over the later holes. Adding
to pressures was the fact that her fiercest competition played
right beside her.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson's late charge delighted the crowd, and the
47-year-old figured that one error by the leader and she could put
herself in position to win her first Tour event since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``On 18, I really thought it was almost too late, but you never
know _ stranger things have happened,'' said Stephenson. ``I've
lost tournaments because you get so nervous coming down the
stretch. I knew if she was above the pin, something could happen.
But from 5 feet, she just had to lag it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lunn's round was two shots off her career best (she fired a 66
in the first round).
</P>
<P>
   Her efforts spoiled the hopes of other notables.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Daniel (279), who entered the day tied with Lunn for third,
bogeyed the second and seventh holes to fall back. When she birdied
13, it appeared she would make a late charge, but bogeys on 16 and
17 took care of that.
</P>
<P>
   Sherri Steinhauer (280) entered the final round with the lead,
marking the seventh time in her career she had done so. She had won
three of those previous events but all but ruined her chances for a
fourth when she double bogeyed the second hole, then bogeyed seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf is a funny game. Today, my mind wasn't clear,'' said
Steinhauer. ``There were a lot of things going on in my mind, and
that's just golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Dottie Pepper (278) took fourth place after a strong back nine
that made up for bogeys on the first two holes. A birdie on 13
brought her to within three shots of the lead, but she shot par the
rest of the way.

MARINERS SEND JEFF FASSERO BACK IN THE BULLPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The last time Jeff Fassero was sent to the bullpen, it
was meant to be temporary.
</P>
<P>
   But that was two months ago, and the main goal was to give
Fassero a mental and physical break. Now, the veteran left-hander
is returning to the bullpen, and this move could be permanent.
Reliever Paul Abbott, who nearly replaced Fassero two weeks ago,
will join the rotation Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the move was only temporary, manager Lou Piniella
gave no indication that Fassero could pitch his way back into the
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``For now, we've got three rookies in the rotation, and we've
got (Jamie) Moyer and we want to give Abbott a chance to pitch,''
Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero said he was not told about how he will be used in relief
or how long this stay might last. On Saturday, he asked pitching
coach Stan Williams about his throw day between starts, which would
have been yesterday. When Williams told Fassero he was going to the
bullpen, Williams said, the pitcher said little.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's their decision,'' Fassero said yesterday. ``I'll live
with it. Just go down there and throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero has held left-handers to a .246 average, compared to
.338 off right-handers, but said he hoped he would not be used as a
specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't be happy if I'm just facing lefties,'' he said. ``If
that's all I'm going to do, I won't be happy, period.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Fassero's role is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pitched well against left-handers, and that affected the
decision,'' Piniella said. ``It gives us two left-handers in the
bullpen, and we'll see how it works out. ... I think it'll help
Jeff out.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be nothing more Fassero can do _ as a starter _ to
salvage the season. He was 3-7 with a 7.23 earned run average in 15
starts before moving to the bullpen in June. He had been allowing
home runs at a lower rate until surrendering four on Friday, but in
nine starts since rejoining the staff, he is 1-6 with a 6.99 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the 36-year-old veteran is 4-13 with a 7.11 ERA and
leads the majors with 34 home runs allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point our goal was just to get him back to .500, when
he was 4-8,'' Williams said. ``But he's 4-13, so it hasn't been
working there. We'll try it in shorter stints. I think he's better
in shorter stints right now.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also to the M's benefit to get an extended look at Abbott.
The club controls Abbott's rights after this season, but Fassero is
a free agent. Abbott was impressive over four starts last
September, and had a five-inning no-decision in his one start in
'99.
</P>
<P>
   APPEALS MOVED UP: Friday's brawl with the New York Yankees came
before the Mariners had resolved the punishments from their
previous fight, with the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 11.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Jose Paniagua, who was suspended for five games, and
right fielder Jay Buhner (four) originally had appeal hearings
scheduled for the last weekend in August, when the M's play in New
York. The hearings have since been rescheduled for a week from
today in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, with the prospect of Frankie (Rodriguez) being suspended,
too, we need to get it resolved,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez hit Chuck Knoblauch with a pitch Friday, and the fight
followed. AL spokeswoman Phyllis Mehrige said the AL has requested
a tape of the incident and will review it today or tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   CROWDED HOUSE: The Mariners set a new club record for attendance
in a four-game series with 180,849 fans coming out to see the
Yankees. As of yesterday morning, there were 6,000 tickets
available for tonight's game against the Chicago White Sox, and
8,500 left for tomorrow's. Fifteen of the 18 games at Safeco Field
have been sellouts.

LOST WEEKEND SPOTLIGHTS MARINERS' PITCHING MESS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It wasn't a totally lost weekend for the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   During the brawl Friday night, Don Zimmer fell down, causing the
68-year-old Yankees coach to limp away on a bum knee that is
scheduled to be surgically replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners sure taught him a lesson: If you're an old,
creaking man, stay away from our bad selves.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Yankees, however, failed to detect a scratch
from their four days in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's lightning was a bigger threat.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's 9-3 win completed the four-game sweep by the world
champs, although four games is a pitiful measure of the gap between
the Yankees and Mariners. But since baseball doesn't use fathoms,
miles or light years, a 28-15 combined score is a decent gauge.
</P>
<P>
   Another one is two World Series titles the Yankees have won
since they lost to the Mariners in 1995. Since that postseason, the
Mariners have won a single playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   While it isn't exactly fair to compare the Mariners with the
club in the world's biggest media market _ although in a wallet
contest between George Steinbrenner and Chris Larson, I'll take the
Mariner part-owner and spot the Yankee boss a billion _ it is fair
to compare the Mariners to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   And they match up _ sad to say for Mariners fans, 180,000 of
whom showed up at the Guilty Pleasure to create a club record for a
four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   The season after the Yankees-Mariners epic postseason saga, the
Mariners shuffled through a club-record 25 pitchers mostly in an
effort to make up for the injury absences of starters Randy Johnson
and Chris Bosio.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, rookie reliever Todd Williams' first appearance Sunday
boosted the total to 26 pitchers, breaking the '96 club record for
aimless futility with seven weeks left, and well ahead of the
annual September callups. At this rate, the Mariners may have need
to reach back into the '96 bucket of pitchers, which you may recall
was Rusty (Meacham), full of Blas (Minor) and frequently went Klink
(Joe).
</P>
<P>
   In apparent celebration of the dubious milestone, manager Lou
Piniella had himself tossed from the game in the seventh inning for
arguing balls and strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella maintained afterward that plate umpire Ted Barrett was
intimidated into a more generous strike zone for Yankees pitchers,
especially David Cone. But Piniella also allowed that since his
reliever, Paul Abbott, walked three straight batters and was wilder
than a night with Dennis Rodman in Vegas, maybe he was a tad
off-base in expecting an umpire to recognize a strike after going
so long without seeing one.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't Sunday's most ill-timed flip-flop. Before the game,
it was announced that Abbott had replaced flailing Jeff Fassero
(4-13) in starting rotation. So Abbott came in as a reliever, and
apparently found the ball so heavy that he left two pitches several
feet shy of the plate. He faced five batters and managed one out
besides the three walks and a leadoff double.
</P>
<P>
   And Abbott's collapse after the removal of John Halama (9-3),
who saw his remarkable nine-game winning streak ended with five
runs in 62/3 innings in the first start against his hometown club.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that the Mariners _ with 14 rookies used,
including eight making their major league debuts and six still on
the roster _ have for a pitching staff a roaring, boiling mess.
</P>
<P>
   Still.
</P>
<P>
   But you knew that. In fact, you've known that for years.
</P>
<P>
   A big difference between now and '96, when the decay set in, is
that the Mariners still had some clutch hitters to compensate for
pitching trouble. But now, at least over the last 19 games, the
Mariners are hitting less than .180 with runners in scoring
position.
</P>
<P>
   Almost nothing can be done about that problem, since the club
has already ridded itself of offensive depth with trades and no
worthy position players are ready in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Another big difference between now and '96 was results. Bad as
things were, the Mariners still won 85 games and finished with a
team ERA of 5.21, about half a run better than the current cast of
dozens.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees series results established what was apparent at the
nonwaiver trading deadline: It's audition time for 2000. Bring your
sheet music to the stage door, kids, and line up quietly. Piniella
admitted as much Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to look at everyone in the system to know exactly
what we have,'' he said. ``There will be no guesswork involved this
winter.''
</P>
<P>
   This winter? What happened to this summer? (Please, no weather
jokes).
</P>
<P>
   ``Put it this way,'' he said. ``If someone deserves to come up,
he'll get the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   So there's a solid chance that the Mariners will shatter the '96
Angels' major league record of 29 pitchers used. And if Fightin'
Frankie Rodriguez hangs on to his boxing license long enough to
start a third brawl (remember, the relief pitcher started the July
11 dust-up at Dodger Stadium too), the Mariners will have so few
arms left that Meacham, Minor and Klink will be recalled in the
fashion of Cy Young, Lefty Grove and Sandy Koufax.
</P>
<P>
   But remember, Zimmer wants no part of these Mariners.

SALMON SNAPS HIS HR skid 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Right fielder Tim Salmon recovered from a
sprained left wrist and returned to the Angels on July 17, but it
took him until Saturday _ 76 at-bats _ to get that first home run.
</P>
<P>
   But by no means does the homer indicate Salmon is ready to be
the hitter he was before the injury _ .347, seven homers, 25 RBI in
26 games. Salmon's wrist is not 100 percent and it won't be the
rest of this season. There are days it feels weak.
</P>
<P>
   In 22 games since coming back, Salmon is hitting .165 (13 for
79) with one homer and eight RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mind's saying one thing and my body's doing something
else,'' Salmon said. ``This is what I'm going to have for the rest
of the year, so I don't make excuses for it. The doctors say it's
going to take an extended period (of rest) to get over this.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury occurred May 3 when Salmon attempted to make a
sliding catch in right field. Initially, the team hoped Salmon
would be out only a few days. But it was soon learned it was much
more serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an injury they said could take four months just to
heal,'' he said. ``I've talked to guys who said it takes the whole
offseason, but I still have to go out and play today.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Carew banged up: Add hitting coach Rod Carew to the Angels'
list of walking wounded. While throwing soft-toss to rookie Trent
Durrington, Carew took a batted ball on the right foot and suffered
a nasty bruise.
</P>
<P>
   Durrington has been up with the big-league club for only a few
days, so injuring a Hall of Famer wasn't exactly getting off on the
right foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's not real good,'' Durrington said in his heavy
Australian accent. ``Not when he's going to be the one helping me.
I'm trying to stay as low key as possible. He didn't say too much
at first, then he took his shoe off. Troy (Glaus) and I had a bit
of a giggle, and Rod laughed too. He took it in pretty good
spirits.''
</P>
<P>
   Some players joked about looking into the cost of a one-way
ticket to Australia, to which Carew responded: ``Get one for me,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Also: First baseman Mo Vaughn continues to make progress
recovering from a staph infection in his right shin. He waved off
reporters before Sunday's game, but according to media spokesman
Tim Mead, Vaughn believes the infection resulted after he fouled a
ball off his leg. . . . Outfielder Garret Anderson was not in the
lineup for the second consecutive day because of a sore left ankle,
injured Friday when he slipped in the outfield. . . . Jim Edmonds
got his second start of the season in center on Sunday.

PATRIOTS' JOHNSON TO HAVE SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ The sun has not yet risen on a new NFL
season, but an ominous eclipse swept across the Patriots Sunday
when it was confirmed that Ted Johnson, the club's brightest star
on defense, likely will be lost for up to four months with a torn
left biceps tendon.
</P>
<P>
   The injury, eerily similar to the torn right biceps tendon that
ended Johnson's 1998 season on Dec. 6, was confirmed by an MRI exam
Sunday morning, and the 27-year-old linebacker is expected to
undergo surgery Monday or Wednesday at Massachusetts General
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lose a guy of great impact on our club, and it's a
tragedy,'' said coach Pete Carroll, who saw his prized linebacker
tear the biceps tendon during the club's intrasquad scrimmage _
Patriot Preview '99 _ Saturday afternoon in Foxborough. ``Ted's put
so much into it, he's been such a diligent worker for so long, and
it's a crusher to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, following the MRI exam in Wellesley, met Sunday &UR;  &LR; night
with Dr. Bert Zarins, the MGH orthopedist who long has been the
club's physician. Neither Johnson nor Zarins was available for
comment. Carroll said he expects Johnson to miss 3-4 months. ``If
it's the long end of it,'' he said, ``that's right around playoff
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll will divulge the details of Zarins's meeting
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night with Johnson Monday in his daily late-morning news
conference here at Bryant College, but the coach made it clear
Sunday that his star linebacker will go under the knife, and the
New England defense will undergo some immediate suturing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, Marty Moore will hold these guys together until we
can get Andy (Katzenmoyer) ready to play that position,'' said
Carroll, looking for Moore, about to enter his sixth season, to
tutor Katzenmoyer, the rookie first-round draft pick out of Ohio
State. ``That's where we'll turn our sights until we know more.
Fortunately, we've got a guy of (Katzenmoyer's) stature who can
take over the spot. It's the spot that Andy played at college, so
that's where we'll turn our attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Injured early in the second quarter Saturday, his arm wrenched
when he tried to slow down rookie running back Kevin Faulk, Johnson
said to a reporter, ``What is it? I'm not sure yet.'' He added,
``It feels just like last year.'' His self-diagnosis was confirmed
when the MRI showed the tear, believed to be where the muscle
attaches to a tendon at the crook of the arm. Johnson has a scar
some 4 inches long near the crook of his right arm, where Zarins
and Dr. Jesse Jupiter repaired the tear last Dec. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Although Johnson may be the best-conditioned athlete on the
team, the wear and tear of the position has extracted a heavy toll
on his chiseled body. He is about to undergo his fourth surgery in
two years. Last January, just over a month after the biceps
surgery, he underwent his second shoulder operation.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, Johnson signed a new contract worth $25.4 million
over five years. Nearly one third of the deal was guaranteed in the
way of a signing bonus _ $3 million last year, $5 million this year
_ and the club could see the 2000 season begin with Johnson having
played only the 13 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   Torn biceps tendons are rare, even in the punishing, often
brutal game of football, and Carroll is at a loss as to how the
same injury could happen twice to the same player.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what Ted and I tried to figure out, talking in the
locker room, you know, `Why's this happening?' '' said Carroll, who
didn't discount the possibility that the Patriots will try to trade
for help at the position. ``He works out more than anybody we have.
He's the No. 1 workout guy in the program, so we're a little bit
baffled by why this would happen to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll also discounted the possibility that perhaps the
injuries were a product of Johnson overtraining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's the case,'' said Carroll, before leading
his charges through a 90-minute afternoon workout. ``I just don't
think that's the case. I don't think he's overpumped. He weighs
about the same weight he did in college. You know, his strength is
tremendous. He's well proportioned, all those types of things, so .
. .''
</P>
<P>
   With Johnson on the sidelines last year after surgery, and with
quarterback Drew Bledsoe working with a fractured right index
finger, the Patriots lost three of their last four games, including
a playoff loss to Jacksonville. To replace Johnson at the center of
the defense is a daunting assignment. Agile and mean, he forges the
defense's personality when he's on the field. In his 57
regular-season games over four seasons, he had 453 tackles,
approximately 70 percent (302) of those unassisted. In five
postseason games, his numbers were just as steady: 44 tackles, 33
unassisted.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's scrimmage, Faulk, the 5-foot-8-inch running back
from LSU, didn't run directly down Johnson's path. If he had,
Johnson wouldn't have needed, or been tempted, to flail out with
his arm, looking only to slow the rookie down. But Johnson got a
piece of Faulk and immediately felt the familiar pain searing in
and around his muscular arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, the ball carrier was going by him, and he reached out
just like he did with (Jerome Bettis) last year, very much the same
situation,'' said Carroll. ``He wasn't trying to tackle the guy, he
was just reaching out to make a play on him. It's different than
the Pittsburgh game in that sense, but the same result.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll try to figure out more, get more information on it,
maybe dig it to find out why, and try to point the finger at
whatever it could be as to why this would happen _ not necessarily
in a negative sense _ but right now we don't know any more that
what we're telling you.''

THERE WAS NO DOUBT _ LUN WAS SMOKING 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUTTON, Mass. _ Mardi Lunn won her first LPGA tournament Sunday.
If you'd like to celebrate with her, hold all victory cigars and
congratulations. Instead, it might be a good idea to buy her a pack
of cigarettes. Make it two if you can afford it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably smoked about 50 zillion more today than usual,''
Lunn said. And that's nothing compared to her mother, Val, who held
a lit cigarette at Pleasant Valley Country Club's 18th hole. Val
was there to praise her daughter and light up. ``She probably had
about 100 zillion,'' Lunn said of the woman she referred to as
``Mum.''
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't guessed by now, Lunn does not say things you
would expect from a pro athlete. Many of them go to schools and
speak of the dangers of nicotine. But Lunn says she has the soul of
a rebel. She grew up viewing the world from a different angle _
she's from Australia _ and it has definitely carried over to her
golf game.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the 31-year-old Lunn won an event called the areaWEB.com
Challenge. She won even though she trailed Sherri Steinhauer by
three strokes at the start of the day and told herself that she
would have to shoot close to her career best (65) to win. She shot
a 67. She won even though one of her shots on No. 6 banged off a
tree and then, eerily, righted itself. She won even though on No.
17 one of her idols and playing partners, Jan Stephenson, noticed
that she was breathing heavily and uncomfortably.
</P>
<P>
   Was she losing her cool or searching for a pack of Kools?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty nervous,'' Lunn said. ``I don't care if you're
Tiger Woods or Karrie Webb, you're going to be nervous in that
situation. I don't think you're human if you're not a bit nervous
at least. I was just trying to take some deep breaths and calm
myself down.''
</P>
<P>
   She knew that if her tension began to control her, she could
always find her mother in the gallery and bum a cigarette. She says
she never has a problem finding Mum, even in large crowds. She has
been known to break her own concentration by asking her mother if
she needs to take a sip or drag of something. I wouldn't be
surprised if she asked the course marshals to lower those
``Quiet!'' signs and instead encourage the fans to make some noise.
Those who walked this tree-lined course with her Sunday may not
have known that she has suspended her drives to attend to her
mother, but anyone watching could see that there was something
different about her game.
</P>
<P>
   One of the truly bizarre things to do on the final round of a
tournament is to wait for leaders to lose their leads. You can
actually tell that some people are disappointed when it doesn't
happen. It's as if everyone wants to see the Greg Norman redux, the
horrible time in 1996 when the golfer blew a six-stroke lead over
Nick Faldo on the final day of the Masters. Norman, also an
Australian, shot a 78 in the final round and Faldo won the tourney
by five strokes. Sunday, Lunn took the lead on No. 9 and never lost
it.
</P>
<P>
   That's even more impressive when you consider that Stephenson,
yet another Aussie, was playing with her. Lunn is 16 years younger
than Stephenson. She played basketball and cricket as a child, but
she idolized two golfers, Norman and Stephenson. So there was Lunn
making difficult shots in front of her idol. But her idol wanted to
win the tournament, too. That would be like telling a singer who
grew up admiring Aretha Franklin to outsing the Queen. Face to
face. Lunn did that, with much support from Stephenson, who
finished second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country really doesn't support women's sports very much,''
said Stephenson, who was one shot from making her own history
Sunday. ``So it's nice to see so many of us (Lunn, Webb, Rachel
Hetherington) doing well. I hate to admit that I'm old enough to be
their mother. That's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   If Stephenson had defeated Lunn Sunday, she says she would have
walked away from the game. Eight years ago outside Miami Arena,
Stephenson suffered hand and shoulder injuries when she was mugged.
She said her attacker tried to snatch a ring from her left hand,
which still throbs. And she hurt her right shoulder when she was
thrown to the ground during the same assault. Now 47, she simply
wants a peaceful and winning close to a long career.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson will eventually get her final, walkaway win. But
Sunday, she embraced Lunn on the 18th green when the tournament was
officially over. She watched as the cool Lunn signed autographs for
young fans. She told herself that her score on Friday, 70, probably
cost her the tournament. She listened as Lunn thanked her and Jane
Crafter for a great Sunday of golfing.
</P>
<P>
   (Crafter also has an unusual approach to golfing. Sunday, she
told two men to freeze because they were walking as she was
preparing to putt. They stopped, she putted, and then she thanked
them for their cooperation.)
</P>
<P>
   Before the 31-year-old woman with the rebellious soul left for
London, she was asked if winning this tournament would change
anything about her. ``Only my bank account,'' she said with a grin.
She earned $120,000 for her win. That means she won't have to worry
about cigarette money for a while.

BOGGS A BIG HIT _ OUTSIDE BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ It was true then, it's true now: Wade
Boggs always has been more appreciated outside of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   When he was hitting .350 for the Red Sox every year, Boggs had
respect around baseball that eluded him in the Hub. This was
evident again this weekend when he cracked the 3,000-hit barrier.
</P>
<P>
   I had to put cynicism on the shelf for Wade's wonderful
celebration at Tropicana Field. Being from Boston, I felt like an
uninvited guest whom everyone was too polite to banish. There was
no one else around to remind him of the tumultuous 11 seasons he
spent in the Hub. It made me want to hide in the corner when Wade
held press conferences to talk about making baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night was electric at Tropicana Field. Everything went
Wade's way. Wade's dad, Win, and his wife, Debbie, sat in Section
106. His son, Brett _ named after George Brett _ sat on a stool
next to the on-deck circle, wearing a Devil Rays uniform. Daughter
Meagann was on the way back from a wedding in West Palm Beach,
scanning past Spanish-language stations on her car's AM radio,
trying to hear the Devil Rays broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Wade grounded to second in his first at-bat against Charles
Nagy, leaving him stalled at 2,997. It seemed like the Wade Watch
might stretch into a new week. But then he hit prototype Boggsian
singles to right in his second and third at-bats and walked to the
plate at 9:05 with a chance to become the 22d player in big-league
history with 3,000 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-nine thousand fans stood and cheered in anticipation. I
couldn't help but think about all the bad stuff that happened on
the way to this moment . . .
</P>
<P>
   Boggs was buried in the Red Sox minor league system for six long
summers. Every major league team passed on a chance to acquire him
for $25,000 when the Sox left him unprotected after he hit .306 in
1980. The Red Sox traded for Carney Lansford the year after Wade
led the International League with a .335 average. Only when
Lansford got hurt in a home-plate crash (June 25, 1982) did Boggs
get a chance (``If Carney doesn't get hurt, none of this happens,''
Boggs said Saturday night).
</P>
<P>
   He finished his rookie season with a .349 average, then began a
string of seven consecutive 200-hit seasons (the only time that's
been done this century). But according to Wade, ``Nobody wrote
anything'' except stuff that was bad.
</P>
<P>
   There was bad stuff. He was ripped by (among others) teammates
Bill Buckner and Roger Clemens (remember Rog saying, ``I'm out
there busting my butt while he's in the clubhouse sitting on his
average''?). Eddie Andelman killed him on sports talk radio, and
Boggs came into the studio to fight back, saying, ``Eddie, I'd love
to hit your weight someday.'' The Sox kept taking him to
arbitration. Boggs was in the visitors' clubhouse in Yankee Stadium
in June 1986 when he got the call telling him his mother had been
killed when a prisoner on work release crashed into her car in
Florida. Boggs wept in the dugout when the Sox lost the '86 Series
at Shea. Then came a seedy affair and Delta Force and depositions.
</P>
<P>
   He was wounded when the Sox gave him a take-it-or-leave-it offer
in the spring of 1992 and left Boston in a huff at the end of that
season. We thought he'd be a tabloid topic when he left the Hub for
the Apple, but that never happened. Boggs got some revenge on the
Red Sox when he won a World Series, then elected to play out his
golden days in the pressure-free atmosphere of Tampa, his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was heartwarming to see Debbie Boggs crying and
applauding her husband when he stepped to the plate to face
Cleveland lefty Chris Haney. Who deserved this moment more than
Debbie Boggs? A nice girl from a poor Tampa family, she married
Wade in December 1976 after his first year of pro ball. She stuck
with him through Winston-Salem, Bristol, Pawtucket, Boston, and
Margo. Hers was the most public of pains, but she fought for what
she believed in and prevailed.

   Wade crushed Haney's 2-2 curveball, sending it four rows past
the right-field fence and into the hands of a 32-year-old college
sports PR guy who works at Meagann's school. En route to second
base, Boggs blew a kiss skyward, in honor of his mother, and did it
again before he knelt and kissed home plate. Wade hugged Brett, and
by then Debbie and Win were being led onto the field. Boggs
embraced his dad, the man who made him read Ted Williams's ``The
Science of Hitting'' when Wade was in high school. Then he embraced
Debbie.
</P>
<P>
   It was Capra-esque, right down to the champagne toast/postgame
press conference, when a breathless, gown-clad Meagann Boggs
appeared in the back of the room and ran up the aisle while her dad
announed, ``Ah, here's my lovely daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing the feeling of hitting the home run for No. 3,000,
Boggs said, ``You couldn't imagine when you are running around the
bases and it's like you're not even touching the ground. Then, when
I got to the plate, it was like a Little League home run because
all the guys were at home plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Boggs has a 12-year-old son. He knows the Little League
etiquette that holds that the entire team must greet a homer hero
at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Wade Boggs played his Little League ball in Tampa, just one long
bridge and a few miles from where he earned immortality Saturday
night. It was a beautiful moment for a man who worked harder than
anybody to make himself a great major league hitter.
</P>
<P>
   History will treat him far better than Boston ever did.

PAN AM GAMES PUT ON GOLD-MEDAL SHOW

 AM GAMES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

   WINNIPEG, Manitoba _ The local organizers had said they couldn't
stage more than 32 sports. There wasn't room or money enough in
this prairie province to put up 5,000 bowlers, judokas,
triathletes, squash players, roller skaters, and water skiers. Yet
when the 13th Pan American Games ended here Sunday night with a
Guess Who reunion concert at Winnipeg Stadium, the hosts had
managed one for the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a gold-medal performance,'' said US Olympic Committee
executive director Dick Schultz, whose star-spangled side topped
the medal table for the 12th straight time at this hemispheric
block party. And so it was.
</P>
<P>
   These Games were superbly organized. They broke even at the cash
till. Except for the usual political turmoil around the Cuban
delegation, they came off with minimal fuss. And, almost certainly,
they were the last of their size.
</P>
<P>
   Don MacKenzie, the man who brought the Pan Ams here for the
second time, has already recommended that the program be chopped
from a gargantuan 41 events to as few as 28. And Santo Domingo, the
Dominican capital, which will hold the 2003 event, agrees. ``We do
recognize that the Pan American Sports Organization has the last
word, but we have to do some kind of reduction,'' says organizing
committee president Jose Joaquin Puello. ``We have to think about
the most popular sports in the Americas, and which of the others
will be left out of the Games.''
</P>
<P>
   On the endangered list are the non-Olympic sports: bowling,
karate, racquetball, roller skating, men's softball, squash, and
water skiing. Unless their federations agree to pay the freight,
they'll probably be axed. The fact is, the Pan Ams have grown so
large (from 29 countries and 2,400 athletes when they were held
here in 1967 to 42 and 5,000 now) that only a handful of countries
in the Americas can handle them. And the bigger they've grown, the
more the Games have tilted the medal count in favor of the US, the
only nation that can afford to bring a full squad in every sport.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the number of medal events slashed from 435 to 327
since last time, the Americans still hauled off 295 _ and that was
using their B+ team, since the top runners, swimmers, boxers, and
rowers were missing. Nobody else could bring their second string
and still win 37 swimming medals.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadians, who spent $90 million on the Games and pumped
loads of development cash into their teams to boost their medal
count, brought their varsity (except for a handful of no-show track
stars such as Donovan Bailey). They grabbed a record 196 medals in
38 sports, vaulting ahead of the Cubans for the first time since
1967. ``We achieved beyond our realistic expectations,'' said Alex
Carre, Canada's chef de mission. ``These Games provided us with a
magic moment we will remember for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Cubans complained bitterly from the start about
everything from security to taunting tabloid coverage to a
``false'' positive doping result on high jumper Javier Sotomayor,
they still won 158 medals in 26 sports and claimed more golds than
the Canadians. For a poor island nation that has been losing
athletes to defection for a decade (seven delegation members
decamped here), that is extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Pan Ams would likely expire if Uncle Sam didn't keep
showing up in force, they survive because nearly every hemispheric
mouse gets a chance to roar at least once. Eighteen countries heard
their anthem played here, including the Netherlands Antilles, which
won a gold in karate. And 27 of the 42 countries put at least one
athlete on the podium. Even the Cayman Islands got something for
the trophy case.
</P>
<P>
   These Games may have grown unwieldy and expensive, but there's
always an eager host or two waiting to roll out a red carpet for
5,000 of their neighbors. ``It is a great challenge for us,''
admits Puello, who insists that Santo Domingo will be ready several
years early. ``Maybe Hurricane No. 48 will destroy us, but we will
do it.''

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Jack McDowell made his last start as an Angel
on Sunday night in the Boston Red Sox's 9-3 win, and quite possibly
McDowell's career is over for good.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels want to take a look at some of their young pitchers
now playing in the minors, and McDowell's spot will open up today.
McDowell, the Cy Young Award winner in 1993, is expected to be
released or traded, if there are any takers. He hopes to catch on
with a pennant contender for the stretch run but admits interest
won't be high, considering the way he's pitched lately.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Notre Dame High graduate lasted only four innings,
giving up five runs and eight hits before 31,664 at Edison Field.
Red Sox starter Pedro Martinez lasted only five innings but yielded
just two runs (one earned) and three hits to earn the victory and
improve to 16-3. Martinez and Houston's Mike Hampton lead the
majors with 16 wins.
</P>
<P>
   Troy O'Leary led the Boston offense with three hits, including
his team-leading 22nd homer. Brian Daubach also homered (No. 16)
and Jason Varitek added a two-run double as the Red Sox took three
of four in the series.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Angels to 46-64, the first time this season
they've been 18 games under .500. They're on a pace to lose 94
games, something they have done only three times in 38 seasons
before this year.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't lost as many as 94 since 1980, when they went
65-95. They went 68-94 in 1974 and 67-95 in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   McDowell (0-4), who had shoulder surgery Feb. 2, said his arm
and shoulder are fine. He knows his past two starts were bad but
points to his first two, when he allowed only three runs in 12
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If no one's going to give me the ball, there's not a whole lot
I can do,'' he said. ``I know in my heart if I'm allowed to go out
there, I'm better than a ton of guys. But the ball's not in my
court right now. I have to wait and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   If there are no takers for McDowell, he indicated he'll probably
retire. Although he said he was retiring after last season, he said
he means it this time, even though he's only 33.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at my age and you would think the second half of my
career is ahead of me,'' he said. ``But I don't envision sitting
around the next six or seven months and then get to spring training
and try to make somebody's team. And even then, still not know if
I'm going to hold up for the season. . . . I may never be a (No.) 1
or 2 gy again, but I know I can still get people out.''
</P>
<P>
   But it won't be with the Angels. Out of the race and looking
ahead to next season, they need to see a number of young arms.
Either Scott Schoeneweis or Jarrod Washburn is expected to take
McDowell's spot initially. Ramon Ortiz might get his chance later
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strange,'' McDowell said. ``I'm only four starts out of
surgery. There's a lot in this game that's good, but you can get
kicked in the face. It's a question of how many times you're
willing to take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could have seen him before his arm injuries,'' Angels
manager Terry Collins said. ``When he was throwing in the 90s, with
his competitiveness, he must've been tough.''
</P>
<P>
   For Martinez, who like McDowell has one Cy Young Award to his
name, Sunday's victory was the 100th of his career. It was his
second start since missing 2{ weeks with a sore shoulder, but it
was far from a memorable performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``My performance today was not as good as I expected, but I'll
take it,'' said Martinez, whose ERA fell to 2.46. ``I was behind in
the count all the time. I had problems with my control. That's not
me.''

POOR PERSONNEL MOVES LEFT PATRIOTS VULNERABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Pete Carroll was born and raised in northern
California, spending most of his developmental years in Marin
County, just across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco. It
is a place where a lot of people believe in karma, although,
frankly, few football players think much about it.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Grier was born and raised on the streets of Detroit, a
tough blue-collar town where they know a lot about cars but not
much about karma. Out there they believe in General Motors, not
general mysticism.
</P>
<P>
   Karma, as defined by the third edition of the American Heritage
Dictionary, is a Hindu and Buddhist idea as simple as this: ``The
total effect of one's actions during the successive phases of one's
existence, regarded as determining one's destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   When Carroll and Grier ask themselves today why so many things
seen to be befalling them that they have no control over but are
destroying their best efforts to erase the memory of Bill Parcells,
they should think about that word. When rookie running back Robert
Edwards's career ended on a Hawaii beach in a flag football game in
February and then middle linebacker Ted Johnson went down Saturday,
probably for the year, with a torn biceps tendon that duplicated an
injury of a year ago and left the Patriots thunderstruck at the
consequences, karma came to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll called the odd injuries in what were basically
non-contact situations terrible breaks, and that they were. But
just maybe there's more to it than that.
</P>
<P>
   Why are these things happening? Carroll, Grier, and owner Bob
Kraft all have to be asking themselves that question today. The
answer is difficult to ascertain, especially in the case of kids
such as Edwards and Johnson, who were among the team's
hardest-working players, both during the season and in the
offseason, but karma may be as good a place to start as any.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to put it, if you hail from the North End instead of
northern California, is this: What goes around comes around.
</P>
<P>
   During the brief tenure of Carroll and Grier, they have run off
much of the soul of the team Parcells left behind. New brooms sweep
clean, and bosses like their own employees, not someone else's, for
some odd reason. Often it's for all the wrong ones.
</P>
<P>
   But what the Patriots' bosses have done time after time is more
than just move good people out, which is their right. They've tried
to send them off under a cloud, which is not right. It is an
unconscionable thing that has happened too many times to be an
accident. Maybe, just maybe, what's gone around is now coming
around like a freight train.
</P>
<P>
   Remember how Curtis Martin, after three brilliant seasons in New
England, wanted to get paid for his work? Suddenly you heard how he
wasn't smart enough to have taken a good deal when New England put
one the table, even though it would have quickly left him underpaid
and unhappy again. Remember how after he left to join Parcells and
the Jets, we suddenly heard all these ``sources'' whispering he was
probably used up after too many injuries, and rookie running backs
gain most of the yardage in the NFL anyway, and oh, by the way, he
produced too many negative yards, as if it was his fault the team
didn't run as effectively as it would have liked?
</P>
<P>
   Remember what happened to Sam Gash a year ago, when the Patriots
refused to re-sign him and then whispered about him, too? They
claimed he was a greedy, injury-prone, malcontent clubhouse lawyer,
when the fact was all he ever wanted to do was win. Perhaps Gash's
view of his worth in dollars and cents was inflated, but whose in
sports these days is not? The fact is the Patriots offered him
nothing, lied about the circumstances of his leaving, and then
talked behind his back to cover themselves. So Gash went off to
Buffalo and became a Pro Bowl blocking back, while his replacement,
Tony Carter, struggled through an injury-plagued season.
</P>
<P>
   They whacked Corwin Brown and traded Jimmy Hitchcock despite
having no one to replace either. Then they tried to tell you the
special teams were fine without Brown and Chris Canty, or Steve
Israel would easily fill Hitchcock's spot, because, as one
management insider said at the time, ``We couldn't do any worse.''
Oh really?
</P>
<P>
   Worse than merely making those moves, Carroll, Grier, and the
rest whispered that Brown couldn't be put on the field and
Hitchcock was a critically limited player. The two of them were so
limited that both started in their divisional championship games
last year (Brown, admittedly, because of injuries to other Jets),
while New England's rebuilt team sat at home for the second
straight January. Hitchcock, in fact, played every snap on a team
that went 15-1, and he intercepted seven passes, returning three
for touchdowns, so just how limited was he? Meanwhile, back at the
ranch, the players Carroll and Grier had touted as their
replacements struggled, and so did the team.
</P>
<P>
   Then, two days before training camp opened this year, the
Patriots here reached a new low when they fired Willie Clay at a
time when they knew he could not get another job because nearly
every team was capped out, money-wise. It was a low point even by
the Patriots' standards, the kind of thing you don't do to people
who have worked and bled and sweated for you for three seasons,
even if you hate their personalities.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots claimed they didn't want to do it, but they had cap
problems themselves and somebody had to go. Yet they conveniently
failed to mention they had twice redone the contract of Vincent
Brisby, who has been as productive as a Russian wheat field for
years but is a quiet company man. If they had not done this, they
could have let him go and solved the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they fired Clay, who had always been at odds with
Carroll over many things, including what Clay saw as his coach's
political, two-faced approach to life. Then they began the same
sort of whispering campaign against him. Suddenly a guy who hadn't
missed a start, a practice, or an offseason workout in five years
was a clubhouse lawyer who had grown too slow to play his position
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Now it was Clay who was limited. Now it was Clay who didn't have
it anymore. Now it was Clay who wasn't as smart as they had always
said he was. Now it was Clay who wasn't as responsible for the
improvement of Ty Law and Lawyer Milloy as we'd been led to
believe. Now it was Clay who wouldn't tackle and couldn't cover _
and why'd we keep him around, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Just the way the Patriots' management had whispered falsehoods
about good soldiers such as Gash, Brown, Hitchcock, and even
Martin, it started again with Clay. Only management knows why it
has to do business this way, but less than 10 days later, Ted
Johnson was gone, perhaps for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Are these things related? Maybe not if you're from Detroit.
Maybe not if you've spent your life concerned with football and not
the more ethereal sides of northern California life.
</P>
<P>
   But if you believe in karma, or just in the fact that what goes
around usually comes around, you have to wonder.

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Hall of Famer Steve Carlton, winner of 329
games, was 27 when he won his 100th game. Hall of Famers Don Sutton
(324 wins) and Tom Seaver (311) were the same age when they reached
100, as were Roger Clemens, the five-time Cy Young Award winner,
and Greg Maddux, the four-time Cy Young winner.
</P>
<P>
   So, it was only natural that someone would ask Pedro Martinez, 2
1/2 months shy of his 28th birthday, whether he could foresee
another couple hundred wins after he claimed career victory No. 100
Sunday night by surviving five cranky innings in the Red Sox' 9-3
win over the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   It was all Martinez could do to keep from laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three hundred? That's so hard to get, I'm not even thinking
about it,'' said the Sox ace (16-3). ``Look what they had to do,
play 20-something years. I'm not going to play 20-something years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I hope I do, but I don't think I will. I need time to
spend with my family, and the lady I will make my wife and with our
kids. Twenty-something years? If I get it before then, fine. But
20-something years? I'm not going to last that long. I'll be at
home, raising my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The winning number Martinez preferred to talk about Sunday night
was three. As in, three straight wins over the Angels after losing
the series opener, 8-0. Three straight wins for the first time in
six weeks. Three straight wins, which were needed to stay even with
the Toronto Blue Jays in the wild-card race while maintaining a
one-game edge over the where-did-they-come-from Oakland Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows, doesn't it?'' Martinez smiled when asked if the Sox
were finally cultivating some much-needed momentum. ``I'm back,
we're starting to work through some injuries, it shows we're making
some improvements.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Brian Daubach and Troy O'Leary treated Team Mickey Mouse
like rat poison all weekend as the Sox, who had 19 hits in a 14-3
blowout Saturday, followed up with 13 in Sunday's twilight affair,
including home runs by Daubach, O'Leary, and Mike Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Donnie Sadler, playing his second straight game in center
field, had two doubles, a sacrifice bunt, and a walk in four plate
appearances, Jose Offerman jump-started the offense again with two
hits, and catcher Jason Varitek delivered a two-out, two-run double
in the fifth as the Sox seized a 7-1 lead for the second straight
game.
</P>
<P>
   While Mo Vaughn, who has one home run in his last 22 games, sat
out the finale of the series with a staph infection, just as he had
missed the previous four games, Daubach stood out by hitting home
runs in three consecutive games for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   After sitting out the series opener, Daubach went 6 for 13 in
the last three games, with three home runs, two doubles, and five
RBIs. O'Leary, who played in all four games, went 9 for 19, with
two home runs, a double, and six RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley, meanwhile, hit a two-run home run in the ninth for his
first homer in nearly a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what it's going to take,'' Stanley said. ``It's a
matter of being consistent. At times, we've played just great
baseball, and then we don't. And ever since I've been here, it
seems like it's always been tough to come to the West Coast. We
started off losing the first one, and you think, `West Coast, here
we go again,' but then we won three in a row playing consistent
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we've got to forget this and play the same way in Kansas
City.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who was one batter away from being lifted with a 7-2
lead in the fifth because of his pitch count, said he never felt
comfortable in his second start since coming off the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little bit off with everything,'' said Martinez, who
walked three, including back-to-back hitters in the third, and
allowed three singles and two runs, one unearned after Daubach's
error in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was visited with two outs in the inning by Jimy
Williams, who presumably conveyed the message that Martinez would
not be permitted to go another batter past the one at the plate,
Tim Salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, not one to give away a win when he was one out from
qualifying for the decision, took Williams at his word, then
rendered Salmon mute by striking him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way I expected to feel after my first start back
in Boston, but this time I felt it,'' Martinez said of his
discomfort. ``When you don't throw the ball the way you want, it
could be mechanical or physical. I think tonight it was more
mechanical. I felt the strength in my arm, but I couldn't spot
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, he didn't need to. Rich Garces spelled him in the
sixth with 1 2/3 innings, and Rheal Cormier got the last seven outs
as large pockets in the crowd of 31,664 rang out with chants of
``Let's Go, Red Sox.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary, who went to high school in nearby Cypress and had
almost as many fans here as fellow homey Nomar Garciaparra, was
asked if he were sorry he had to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got family here,'' he said. ``It was fun to see them. I
stayed with my mom for four days, but that's enough, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, who reportedly intend Monday to release
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night's starter, Jack McDowell, surely feel the same way.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
CHICAGO _ With all due respect, a contingent of Astros could have
spent the weekend lounging on the beach at Lake Michigan, cruising
the Magnificent Mile or challenging what's left of the Chicago
Bulls to a game of pickup basketball.
<TEXT>
<P>
   What about the Cubs?
</P>
<P>
   Just leave them to Carl Everett, who was at it again Sunday,
driving in three runs in the Astros' 6-2 victory on a chilly night
at Wrigley Field. Mike Hampton became the National League's first
16-game winner and established a career high for victories in a
season.
</P>
<P>
   Everett concluded a huge weekend with two more hits, giving him
a .692 batting average (9-for-13) in the series.
</P>
<P>
   How big was his impact? Everett, who was activated from the
disabled list Friday, factored into 11 of the Astros' 22 runs in
the series with 10 RBIs and four runs scored, three on homers. The
only game the Cubs won was the one Everett spent on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to find out what Carl's been eating,'' Astros second
baseman Craig Biggio said. ``Thank God he was activated in time for
this series. We would have been in trouble without him. Carl is a
tremendous player, and he was huge this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when Hampton (16-3) would have been in trouble
without command of his pitches, but he clearly has learned to win
with less than his best stuff. Hampton has walked 11 batters in his
last two starts, including a season-high six Sunday, but he managed
to win each time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely a battle,'' said Hampton, who allowed two
runs on four hits in seven innings. ``So much of pitching is
rhythm, and I never got into one. I was trying to make adjustments
the whole game. But I'll take two runs in seven innings every time
out.''
</P>
<P>
   As for being atop the NL in wins (Boston's Pedro Martinez also
has 16 to lead the American League), Hampton said: ``It's very
satisfying. But I've learned that you can't control wins and
losses. Sometimes you pitch well and lose; sometimes you don't
pitch so well and win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros won for the 21st time in their last 28 games and
maintained a three-game lead over Cincinnati in the NL Central.
</P>
<P>
   Since manager Larry Dierker returned to the dugout following
brain surgery, the Astros are 18-7. No wonder there was a fan at
Wrigley Field with a sign that read, ``Larry Dierker for
President.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even think I'd win that vote in my own clubhouse,''
Dierker joked.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros collected 14 hits, and every player Dierker sent to
the plate reached base at least once except Richard Hidalgo, who
entered in the bottom of the seventh inning and batted only once.
Hidalgo did, however, have two assists, giving him 15 for the
season, tops among big-league outfielders. Everett, Russ Johnson,
Jeff Bagwell, Matt Mieske and Randy Knorr had two hits apiece.
</P>
<P>
   After taking three of four games from the Cubs, the Astros move
on to Atlanta, where they figure to face tougher competition from
the Braves over the next three days.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, who has won seven consecutive decisions, enjoyed a
1-2-3 first inning but struggled with his control in the second,
walking Cubs pitcher Micah Bowie with the bases loaded for the
game's first run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamp had a good performance, but he was far from being at his
best,'' Dierker said. ``He was wild at times, and he was falling
behind in the count. He has learned to keep the ball out of the
hitting zone at all costs, which is smart to a point. But if you
walk too many guys, eventually you're going to have to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros sent nine batters to the plate in the third, scoring
three runs _ all after two were out _ on four hits and a pair of
walks. Everett hit a two-run single up the middle, and Mieske
chimed in with an RBI single that glanced off shortstop Jose
Nieves' glove and into shallow left field.
</P>
<P>
   Everett struck again in the fifth, scoring Bagwell from third
with a single to left. The switch-hitting outfielder extended his
hitting streak to 10 games, dating to before he went on the
disabled list. He's hitting .486 during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have an explanation for it,'' said Everett, who was
5-for-6 with runners in scoring position during the series. ``I was
just making contact at the right time and hitting the ball where no
one was. I was focused the entire time, but other than that, who
can explain it? Like I've been saying: I'm just going to ride it
out for as long as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton retired six of the next seven batters he faced after
Bowie's bases-loaded walk, then walked Benito Santiago to start the
bottom of the fifth. Santiago went to third on Chad Meyers' first
career hit _ a double to right _ and scored on Jeff Blauser's
ground ball to second base.
</P>
<P>
   Bowie (0-3), making only the second start of his big-league
career, was replaced by Rod Beck with one out in the sixth inning.
The rookie lefthander allowed four runs on 10 hits and three walks.
The Astros, who scored two more runs in the eighth inning, improved
their record to 24-10 in games started by lefthanders.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; THE MEADOWLANDS: WILDERNESS ADVENTURES AT THE EDGE OF A CITY &LR; 
By Robert Sullivan. Anchor/Doubleday, $12.95. Much is buried in
this swampy region of New Jersey, from the remnants of the original
Pennsylvania Station to (perhaps) the remains of the labor leader
Jimmy Hoffa. The author explores the terrain, noting nature's
triumphs over sludge. Last year in The New York Times Book Review,
Robert Pinsky called this a ``provocative, audacious book.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ETERNAL CURSE ON THE READER OF THESE PAGES &LR;  By Manuel Puig.
University of Minnesota, $15.95. The forbidding title is actually
the opening line of the jailhouse journal of Ramirez, a former
political prisoner in the author's native Argentina. Ramirez, 74,
can't remember anything; Larry, 36, who pushes him in a wheelchair
around Greenwich Village in New York, doesn't have much to
remember. The novel, the first Puig wrote in English, examines the
men's symbiotic relationship. ``Puig spins a fascinating web of
words, capturing the reader's attention with his uncanny ability to
develop plot and character through dialogue,'' Allen Josephs wrote
in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has also restored to print  &UR; BLOOD OF REQUITED
LOVE &LR; , translated by Jan L. Grayson ($15.95), Puig's novel about
the troubled inner life of Josemar, a manual laborer in Brazil.
``Puig is adept at parodying people's awkward attempts to find a
language for their emotions,'' Jean Franco wrote in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HEALING LESSONS &LR;  By Sidney J. Winawer with Nick Taylor.
Routledge, $16. There was a terrible irony in the diagnosis Andrea
Winawer faced: intestinal cancer was a disease on which her husband
was an expert. He describes how her suffering taught him an empathy
that his medical training could not have done. This memoir
``reminds us to live fully, intensely,'' Abraham Verghese wrote
last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GLORIE &LR;  By Caryn James. Penguin, $12.95. This novel by the
chief television critic of The New York Times has an unusual
heroine: an elderly widow trying to hang on to her house, her
independence and the memory of her husband. ``One cannot help being
moved by her plight and by the unanswerable questions she asks,''
Richard Burgin wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHILDREN OF CAMBODIA'S KILLING FIELDS: MEMOIRS BY SURVIVORS &LR; 
Compiled by Dith Pran. Edited by Kim DePaul. Yale University,
$14.95. The murder of Cambodians by the Khmer Rouge was so
widespread that it is hard to believe anyone survived. These
testimonies, gathered by Dith Pran, a photographer for The New York
Times who himself escaped the killing, build ``a solid, irrefutable
censure of one of humanity's most shocking crimes,'' Lance Gould
said in The New York Times Book Review in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   One woman's experience has been restored to print in  &UR; THE STONES
CRY OUT: A CAMBODIAN CHILDHOOD, 1975-1980 &LR; , by Molyda Szymusiak,
translated by Linda Coverdale (Indiana University, $12.95). Writing
under the name given her by her adoptive parents, Polish exiles in
Paris, the author describes how she and three younger cousins
became the only survivors of 20 members of her original family.
``This is a powerful and compelling story,'' Jane Hamilton-Merritt
wrote in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   David P. Chandler analyzes the leader of the genocide in
 &UR; BROTHER NUMBER ONE: A POLITICAL BIOGRAPHY OF POL POT &LR;  (Westview,
$16), reissued in a revised and updated edition. The dictator
emerges here as a ruthless ideologue and megalomaniac who also
managed to be a charismatic politician. In 1992 the reviewer
Frederick Z. Brown called it ``an absorbing and authoritative
portrait ... and a fascinating insight into Cambodia's cruel
history.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE DOWER HOUSE &LR;  By Annabel Davis-Goff. St Martin's Griffin,
$13.95. Taking place in the 1950s and '60s, this novel captures the
faded glory of an Anglo-Irish family that clings to its aristocracy
despite its lost wealth. ``The book feels like a Christmas dinner:
rich, heavy, extravagant, lush _ and traditional in a way that no
one would dream of objecting to,'' Jacqueline Carey wrote last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GETTING AWAY WITH MURDER: HOW POLITICS IS DESTROYING THE
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM &LR;  By Susan Estrich. Harvard University,
$12.95. A law professor proposes radical ideas that are really
old-fashioned ones: restricting efforts to shape juries and
allowing jurors' common sense, not expert opinions, to prevail.
``Estrich writes with verve and wit and style,'' the reviewer Akhil
Reed Amar wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE ESSENCE OF THE THING &LR;  By Madeleine St. John. Carroll &AMP;
Graf, $11.95. A finalist for Britain's Booker Prize in 1997, this
novel begins with an abrupt end: Nicola, the heroine, returns to
her London flat after buying cigarettes, only to be greeted by her
lover's demand that she move out. It is ``a brisk, sophisticated
and artful narrative,'' Gardner McFall wrote earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE FOREIGN STUDENT &LR;  By Susan Choi. Harper Perennial, $13. They
are an unlikely couple: Chuck, formerly Chang, a student who has
fled a war-shattered life in 1950s Korea, and Katherine, the
daughter of a wealthy Southern family. But both have nightmares to
escape. ``Choi brings hundreds of small scenes to life, then uses
them to construct an intricate portrait,'' Kimberly B. Marlowe
wrote in 1998.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Aug. 8, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   (Moved in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-GRIDLOCK-REVIEW (Washington) _ Congress has recessed
with little to show for itself beyond an arsenal of political
soundbites stockpiled to serve as campaign themes for a high-stakes
election that is still more than a year away. Still, hasn't it been
said that in a democracy the people get the government they
deserve? Can voters really expect anything but gridlock if they
elect a Democratic president, a Republican-dominated Senate and a
House nominally under Republican control but actually divided
nearly in two? By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   ELDERLY-REINVENT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The AARP is trying to
retrofit itself for the baby boomers, the next great wave of the
aged, who began turning 50 three years ago and thus became eligible
for that incredibly fraught rite of passage, membership in the
AARP. Officials say they have no intention of short-changing their
older members, who in many ways have more traditional expectations
of retirement and what they want from a senior citizens'
organization. But the boomers are different. And the mighty AARP's
struggle to adjust says a lot about how the boomers will remake the
aging process. By Robin Toner.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   MALLS-DECLINE-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at why so many shopping
malls are dead or dying. One reason is greater competition _ in
some cases from re-imagined downtown blocks that developers, in an
interesting about-face, have remodeled to mimic malls. Usually,
where a mall has failed, a bigger, more state-of-the-art shopping
mecca looms on the horizon. Some are being `de-malled' to create
drive-up-to-the-door strip centers, which an increasing number of
shoppers find more convenient than the vast, multi-level centers
with miles of parking lots and walkways. But some critics feel
shopping centers have reached their saturation point. By Elin
Schoen Brockman.
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL-MUSIC-KIDS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Businesses across North
America are deploying symphonies to drive people away. In tactics
akin to psychological warfare, merchants, building owners and
transit officials switch on the classics to scatter loiterers,
especially teenagers. Criminologists trace the trend to a 7-Eleven
store in Victoria, British Columbia, which began bombarding its
parking lot with classical music in 1985 to dissuade teenagers from
congregating there. By David Wallis.
</P>
<P>
   FARM-AID-REVIEW (Washington) _ Federal farm policy is creating
bigger farms and fewer farmers, converting tens of billions of tax
dollars into cattle fodder, creating big profits for big
agribusiness and underwriting cheap hamburgers, but bringing little
benefit _ and, some argue, great harm _ to small farmers trying to
make a living. A system that began in the Depression to help
farmers survive is now `planting a seed that is going to destroy
American agriculture as we know it,' says Sen. Phil Gramm. By Tim
Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   DUBIOUS-SCIENCE-REVIEW (Undated) _ It seems that almost any
scientific-sounding extrapolation for taking off pounds or putting
on IQ points can quickly gain a seal of approval from public health
groups or educators and help set policy for untold years to come.
Sometimes it has nothing to do with science. By Gina Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   TEACHER-PAY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Ask a teacher what needs to be
done to improve dismal student performance, and it's a good bet the
first answer will be to raise teachers' salaries, thereby
attracting and keeping better teachers. But there is scant evidence
that higher salaries alone make a difference in student
performance. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   PETS-FAKE-TESTICLES-REVIEW (Undated) _ `Neuticles' are
artificial testicles implanted for cosmetic reasons in dogs, cats,
horses and other pets that have been neutered. By Douglas Martin.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   WORLD-TREATIES-REVIEW (United Nations) _ Over the last decade,
many countries concerned about problems that transcend their
borders and threaten to overwhelm them have been signing on to one
treaty or convention after another aimed at reigning in abusive
regimes, ending the mistreatment of the weak and cutting back on
the proliferation of all kinds of weapons. Washington often watches
all this with an array of not-very-positive reactions: diminishing
enthusiasm in the White House, unease in the Pentagon, and mounting
outrage in Congress, always on the lookout for invasions of U.S.
sovereignty to beat back. By Barbara Crosette.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-MYSTICISM-REVIEW (London) _ The approach of the first
full solar eclipse in Britain in 72 years, and the last of the
millennium, is being hailed by pagans, druids, doomsayers and New
Age Travelers who interpret it in many ways, from divine felicity
to the end of the world _ anything except celestial science. And
that says something about a nation whose stereotype of proud
pragmatism seems mirrored, or even challenged, by this strain of
mysticism and quest for alternative meanings. By Alan Cowell.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-GUNS-REVIEW (Johannesburg) _ Guns are everywhere in
Africa, a legacy of conflict and a result of lax gun control. There
are gun stores in fancy malls, including designer gun shops where
the rich buy slick, showy little guns hoping to protect themselves
from the high crime rate. Police and army roadblocks are standard
practice all over the continent, manned by young men with huge
automatic weapons dangling carelessly from their shoulders. By
Suzanne Daley.

   ELDERLY-REINVENT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The AARP is trying to
retrofit itself for the baby boomers, the next great wave of the
aged, who began turning 50 three years ago and thus became eligible
for that incredibly fraught rite of passage, membership in the
AARP. Officials say they have no intention of short-changing their
older members, who in many ways have more traditional expectations
of retirement and what they want from a senior citizens'
organization. But the boomers are different. And the mighty AARP's
struggle to adjust says a lot about how the boomers will remake the
aging process. By Robin Toner.

<P>
   MALLS-DECLINE-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at why so many shopping
malls are dead or dying. One reason is greater competition _ in
some cases from re-imagined downtown blocks that developers, in an
interesting about-face, have remodeled to mimic malls. Usually,
where a mall has failed, a bigger, more state-of-the-art shopping
mecca looms on the horizon. Some are being `de-malled' to create
drive-up-to-the-door strip centers, which an increasing number of
shoppers find more convenient than the vast, multi-level centers
with miles of parking lots and walkways. But some critics feel
shopping centers have reached their saturation point. By Elin
Schoen Brockman.
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL-MUSIC-KIDS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Businesses across North
America are deploying symphonies to drive people away. In tactics
akin to psychological warfare, merchants, building owners and
transit officials switch on the classics to scatter loiterers,
especially teenagers. Criminologists trace the trend to a 7-Eleven
store in Victoria, British Columbia, which began bombarding its
parking lot with classical music in 1985 to dissuade teenagers from
congregating there. By David Wallis.
</P>
<P>
   FARM-AID-REVIEW (Washington) _ Federal farm policy is creating
bigger farms and fewer farmers, converting tens of billions of tax
dollars into cattle fodder, creating big profits for big
agribusiness and underwriting cheap hamburgers, but bringing little
benefit _ and, some argue, great harm _ to small farmers trying to
make a living. A system that began in the Depression to help
farmers survive is now `planting a seed that is going to destroy
American agriculture as we know it,' says Sen. Phil Gramm. By Tim
Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   DUBIOUS-SCIENCE-REVIEW (Undated) _ It seems that almost any
scientific-sounding extrapolation for taking off pounds or putting
on IQ points can quickly gain a seal of approval from public health
groups or educators and help set policy for untold years to come.
Sometimes it has nothing to do with science. By Gina Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   TEACHER-PAY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Ask a teacher what needs to be
done to improve dismal student performance, and it's a good bet the
first answer will be to raise teachers' salaries, thereby
attracting and keeping better teachers. But there is scant evidence
that higher salaries alone make a difference in student
performance. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   PETS-FAKE-TESTICLES-REVIEW (Undated) _ `Neuticles' are
artificial testicles implanted for cosmetic reasons in dogs, cats,
horses and other pets that have been neutered. By Douglas Martin.

<P>
   WORLD-TREATIES-REVIEW (United Nations) _ Over the last decade,
many countries concerned about problems that transcend their
borders and threaten to overwhelm them have been signing on to one
treaty or convention after another aimed at reigning in abusive
regimes, ending the mistreatment of the weak and cutting back on
the proliferation of all kinds of weapons. Washington often watches
all this with an array of not-very-positive reactions: diminishing
enthusiasm in the White House, unease in the Pentagon, and mounting
outrage in Congress, always on the lookout for invasions of U.S.
sovereignty to beat back. By Barbara Crosette.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-MYSTICISM-REVIEW (London) _ The approach of the first
full solar eclipse in Britain in 72 years, and the last of the
millennium, is being hailed by pagans, druids, doomsayers and New
Age Travelers who interpret it in many ways, from divine felicity
to the end of the world _ anything except celestial science. And
that says something about a nation whose stereotype of proud
pragmatism seems mirrored, or even challenged, by this strain of
mysticism and quest for alternative meanings. By Alan Cowell.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-GUNS-REVIEW (Johannesburg) _ Guns are everywhere in
Africa, a legacy of conflict and a result of lax gun control. There
are gun stores in fancy malls, including designer gun shops where
the rich buy slick, showy little guns hoping to protect themselves
from the high crime rate. Police and army roadblocks are standard
practice all over the continent, manned by young men with huge
automatic weapons dangling carelessly from their shoulders. By
Suzanne Daley.

<P>
   Whatever the shortcomings of professional wrestling as a sport _
and purists say they are many _ it is definitely a business, and a
highly profitable one.
</P>
<P>
   Just how profitable became clear when World Wrestling Federation
Entertainment Inc., which promotes and stages Wrestlemania and the
top-rated cable television program ``Raw Is War,'' filed documents
with federal securities regulators indicating that it intends to
sell up to $172 million in stock to the public.
</P>
<P>
   In the 12 months ended April 30, the WWF earned pretax profits
of $58 million on revenues of $251 million, a rate of return that
puts the company in a league with the most lucrative sports
franchises.
</P>
<P>
   Few true sports, however, prize an athlete's ``acting ability''
as much as his physical presence, as the WWF says it does, and few
leagues script performances right down to each combatant's entrance
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it too farcical to pay attention to,'' said Andrew
Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College who studies the
business of sports. ``The question in my mind is whether it should
be considered sport or theater.''
</P>
<P>
   The WWF's stock offering is likely to get an enthusiastic
reception from individual investors. Professional portfolio
managers, however, might cast a more skeptical eye on the fact that
the company's chairman also participates in wrestling matches, his
wife is the chief executive and the board, as yet, has no
independent directors to help make sure that only the matches are
rigged.

   A Star Is Born, in Queens
</P>
<P>
   It's not quite the same as the 1920s, when the motion picture
industry was centered in New York and Gloria Swanson, W.C. Fields,
the Marx Brothers and Paul Robeson were making movies at the Famous
Players-Lasky Studio in the Astoria section of Queens, New York
City. But the studio and New York are undergoing a remarkable
revival of film and television production.
</P>
<P>
   The studio, now known as Kaufman Astoria Studios, said it would
build an $8.3 million, 18,000 square-foot soundstage, the seventh
at the complex. ``Ransom'' and the ``First Wives Club'' were shot
at Astoria, which serves as home to the CBS comedy ``Cosby'' and
the Children's Television Workshop program ``Sesame Street.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a great surge of business over the past five
years,'' said Mitchell Brill, director of operations at Lifetime
Studios, a tenant at the complex. ``The broadcast and cable
television business is extremely robust. I've got clients three
deep on hold.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of films shot in New York soared to 221 last year, up
from 69 in 1993. And even if there's been a slowdown in the film
industry this year, television production has plugged the gap. The
HBO series ``Sex and the City'' and ``The Sopranos'' are taped at
Silvercup Studios in Queens, while ``Law and Order'' has set up
house at the Pier 59 Studios in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question New York is hot. The number of prime-time
television series shot here will double to 12 this fall, with the
addition of ``Third Watch,'' ``Now &AMP; Again,'' ``Special Victims
Unit'' and ``The Beat.'' Some of it is location driven, but the
trend is also fueled by the simple desire of Bill Cosby, Kyra
Sedgwick, Ron Howard and Michael J. Fox to go home at night when
they finish shooting, respectively, ``Cosby,'' ``Talk to Me,''
``Bellevue'' and ``Spin City.''

   Ruling Creates Logjam In the Pacific Northwest  &QL;

<P>
   Various species of snails, salamanders and the red tree vole, a
small rodent, could take on the importance of the famed northern
spotted owl in the Pacific Northwest's continuing battle over
logging. The same federal judge who once halted logging in the
old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest to protect the owl
ruled that two federal agencies had failed to insure the monitoring
and protection of 77 other species.
</P>
<P>
   Judge William Dwyer of the U.S. District Court in Seattle
blocked nine major logging deals and threatened to hold up more
than 100 others. Hailing the decision, environmental groups said
Dwyer had stopped the agencies from ``putting logging activities
ahead of their responsibilities to protect wildlife, fish, clean
water and old-growth forests.''

   After months of internal upheaval, the Christian Coalition got

organizations of all stripes can go in activities that verge on
political.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition, the largest group of religious conservatives, was
not completely exonerated. It must pay a civil penalty for efforts
that promoted the candidacies in 1994 of Newt Gingrich, who soon

   When Cayman Islands banker John Mathewson was nabbed in San

he quickly offered federal agents an investigative gold mine:
investigators got their first ever access to computer tapes of a
Cayman bank's transactions and the real names behind some 2,000
bogus depositor names. Overnight the American and his Guardian Bank
&AMP; Trust Co. became the worst nightmare of the British
protectorate's bankers. The Caymans are the world's fifth largest
financial center because of strict confidentiality laws, no
taxation and a determined non-cooperation with U.S. tax probers.
</P>

   Mathewson drew a lenient sentence of five-years probation for
his cooperation in present cases that have put $50 million in taxes
and penalties in federal coffers. Future cases could bring $250

   Gun Toll in Dollars

   Most discussion about gun violence focuses on the human toll.
But a new study shows that when guns are fired, everyone gets hit _

in The Journal of the American Medical Association. Nearly half
that cost is picked up by taxpayers. ``It is really everybody's

   Court Overturns Ouster Of a Gay Boy Scout  &QL;

   Does the pledge of ``morally straight'' in the Boy Scout Oath
mean homosexuality is immoral? Lawyers for the Scouts say yes and
argue that this guaranteed a First Amendment right of ``expressive
association'' to expel a gay Eagle scout in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimous opinion, the New Jersey Supreme Court disagreed,
saying morally straight meant goodness, with no sexual
connotations. The justices likened treatment of the former Boy
Scout, James Dale, now 29, to discrimination against women and
blacks. Scout officials said they will take their case to the U.S.
Supreme Court.

   Court Overturns Ouster Of a Gay Boy Scout  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Does the pledge of ``morally straight'' in the Boy Scout Oath
mean homosexuality is immoral? Lawyers for the Scouts say yes and
argue that this guaranteed a First Amendment right of ``expressive
association'' to expel a gay Eagle scout in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimous opinion, the New Jersey Supreme Court disagreed,
saying morally straight meant goodness, with no sexual
connotations. The justices likened treatment of the former Boy
Scout, James Dale, now 29, to discrimination against women and
blacks. Scout officials said they will take their case to the U.S.
Supreme Court.

PROSTHETIC PET TESTICLES: IF DOGS COULD TALK, THEY'D SAY, `ARE YOU

   In ``The Lorax,'' Dr. Seuss wrote about ``thneeds,'' an
absolutely useless product for which an entire forest is destroyed.
Compared to what you are about to read, thneeds seem essential.
</P>
<P>
   This is a story about artificial testicles for pets.
</P>
<P>
   Some 25,532 sets were said to have been sold in 50 states and 14
countries _ including one for a horse in Louisiana that was
outfitted two weeks ago _ and ain't capitalism grand?
</P>
<P>
   The inventor and manufacturer of the gumdrop-shaped implants,
Gregg A. Miller, who lives in the Kansas City area, came up with
the idea seven years ago when he had his 200-pound bloodhound Buck
neutered. Three years later he patented ``Neuticles,'' just as
profits from a previous invention, candy in a tube, had dried up.
And he has expanded the line to include other animals, particularly
cats.
</P>
<P>
   The cheaper polyprophylene model sells for $25 to $32 a set; the
newer solid silicone alternative, called ``Neuticle Naturals''
sells for $80 to $129. The implantation procedure takes two or
three minutes, and there have been no reported medical
complications. ``It's as easy as changing a light bulb,'' Miller
said.
</P>
<P>
   But why?
</P>
<P>
   Some experts suggest it is not done for the pets. ``The dog
doesn't care,'' said Sean Aiken, a surgeon at the Animal Medical
Center in New York. ``Very few dogs are truly vain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dogs could care less,'' Laura Keagy, office manager of the
Beverly Hills Small Animal Hospital, which offers neuticles. ``But
a lot of clients have trouble with a male dog being castrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sheldon Yessenow, a veterinarian at the Oronoque Animal
Center in Stratford, Conn., said a client had asked for neuticles
and that he had dutifully ordered some. But when it came time to do
the operation, he could not install them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was ridiculous and unethical,'' he said, saying
if the dog ran away and ended up with new owners, he might end up
getting neutered twice.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a time when lots of people will do seemingly
anything for their pets. There are pet vacations, pet gourmet foods
and pet perfumes. Pets get hip replacements, cataract operations
and dental jobs. About the only thing they don't get is plastic
surgery. Indeed, the clipping of ears and tails of some breeds is
on the downswing. (It's illegal in Britain.) Floppy-eared Dobermans
have won dog shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is tending toward a more natural look, including the
dog world,'' Ms. Keagy said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's contention is that dogs  &UR; do  &LR;  know the difference, and
that they suffer from what he calls ``post-neutering trauma.'' He
asked, ``Why wouldn't they know they've lost an important body
part?''
</P>
<P>
   But do they dwell on it? Ingrid Newkirk, president of the People
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, thinks not. ``It's like
switching from regular to skim to soy milk,'' she said. ``You get
adjusted to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Manevitz, a psychiatrist at New York Presbyterian Hospital,
suggests that people are showing a good side of themselves by
investing their animals with concerns that are important to human
beings. ``It's identifying with suffering,'' he said. ``It has a
sweet quality to it, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   One question remains. Does Buddy, the Clinton family's chocolate
Labrador, have Neuticles? Miller claims to have gotten a personal
thank-you note from the president after sending a pair at the time
of the dog's neutering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw or heard anything about any unusual features,''
said Barry Toiv, a White House spokesman. ``But I'll check on it.''
</P>
<P>
   He did. No Neuticles.

SOUTH AFRICA AND GUNS: ARMED AND FASHIONABLE IN JOHANNESBURG

<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Not long ago, outside the
razor-wire-topped fence around our house here, I drove past a man
in street clothes with a large pistol tucked in the leather holster
at his waist. After a second, I decided he must be a security
guard. But I looked at that gun and scoffed. What was he going to
do with such a puny gun, and holstered besides? Up the street was a
guard pacing a driveway with a pump-action shotgun. Now that might
do some good.
</P>
<P>
   I went about my business.
</P>
<P>
   Could this be me? Four years ago, when I lived on the Upper West
Side of Manhattan, the sight of a civilian with a gun on my block
would have left me slightly out of breath. I would have hustled my
kids inside, asked the doorman who that guy was and probably called
the police. At least I would make sure he was a licensed, trained
guard.
</P>
<P>
   But guns are everywhere in Africa, a legacy of conflict and a
result of lax gun control. Here the special line for checking guns
at the airport is often as long as the one to go through the metal
detector. There are gun stores in South Africa's fanciest malls,
within spitting distance of Godiva chocolates and Fendi handbags.
Of course, these are designer gun shops, where the rich buy slick,
showy little guns hoping to protect themselves from a crime rate
that is among the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But that is the upscale stuff. Police and army roadblocks are
standard practice all over the continent, manned by young men with
huge automatic weapons dangling carelessly from their shoulders. In
South Africa, you might be asked for a bribe. In some other
countries, the roadblocks are often an encounter with hungry,
drunken youths itching to show their authority.
</P>
<P>
   Since moving here four years ago, I have learned to distinguish
an AK-47 from a South African R-4 or an R-5 from an Uzi _ though
this skill isn't much use. They can all kill you. Still, the
learning process is a little like getting to know the kinds of
trees and birds that are native here.
</P>
<P>
   I even know enough to laugh at the swaggering revolutionaries on
the Comoros Islands who taped three ammunition magazines together:
The move might look Rambo-ish, but it's pretty useless. Tape two
banana clips together and you save time loading. Three doesn't
work: You'll be tangled up in tape for half an hour. Yes, this is
me talking. The lady in the designer jeans.
</P>
<P>
   The first time I arrived late at night at my hotel in Angola I
thought I was done for when two figures moved out of the shadows
with machine guns. Now I know they are the doormen, and I don't
like getting out of the car until I see the glint of their
hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most unlikely South Africans carry guns. Early on, we
were invited to dinner by a couple _ both television producers.
They were smart and funny and we had journalism in common. You
might have met them on the Upper West Side.
</P>
<P>
   But then, as it often does here, the subject turned to crime.
The husband started talking about caliber, ammunition and, with
some modesty, of course, what a good shot he was.
</P>
<P>
   Could he be serious? He was. He favored ankle holsters. He
 &UR; always &LR;  carried a gun.
</P>
<P>
   More shocking still was the day we discovered that a woman my
husband drools over _ a woman who might actually have Barbie Doll
proportions _ drove around town with a little gun in her lap. She
was the mother of my youngest daughter's best friend. My daughter
was in that car a lot _ and had never been told to put on her seat
belt.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many guns here that cops even have to watch out for
the good guys. When I did a story about drug-trafficking in South
Africa, a group of undercover police officers told me the story of
how they tried to arrest one of the big bosses behind the street
sales. They lured him out of his mansion to make an exchange on the
street. But when a grungy looking undercover officer pulled his gun
out to arrest the man, more than a half dozen well-meaning citizens
misunderstood the situation. They saw only a white man in a
Mercedes being held up at gunpoint. Soon, the police officer was
begging for his life.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa is now considering broad new anti-gun legislation
that would make all gun owners apply for new licenses, prove their
need to be armed and take a mental health test. Gun owners are
furious. Whether the law could be enforced is a question. After
all, the current laws already are pretty tough, and widely
circumvented. To buy a gun, you have to pass a police check which
can take months. But generally, the police are inept and corruption
is rampant. One of the biggest gangsters in Cape Town was recently
found to have a legitimate license for his gun.
</P>
<P>
   And no matter what South Africa's laws, there will always be
easy access to guns _ big guns _ nearby. Mozambique is awash with
weapons, left over from its long civil war. Even civilians were
armed by the various factions, and by some estimates there are
still enough AK-47s around to arm every man, woman and child in
that country.
</P>
<P>
   At night in our lush suburb with a pool in every yard, the pop
of gun fire can be heard regularly. But it usually takes a visitor
to remind me. Like the screeches of the ibises that peck the thatch
from our roof, I don't even hear them anymore.
</P>
<P>
   I do still draw the line at having a gun in my own household.
While I was away once, my husband _ who now brags that he outshot
everyone on a game-ranger course _ got into the game in a small
way. He bought a BB gun and swore our two girls to secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   But he forgot to clean up the packaging. Was there a gun to go
with the box, I asked the girls? They laughed. Oh yes, Dad had
showed them how to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   In a fury, I found the BB gun and buried it deep behind some
bushes in the yard.
</P>
<P>
   Really, if we are going to do this, we need a better gun than
that.

AARP AND THE NEW OLD: THE RETIREMENT LOBBY GOES VA-VA-BOOM! 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By ROBIN TONER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First there was the name change. The American
Association of Retired Persons is no longer the American
Association of Retired Persons. It is AARP, and Horace Deets, its
executive director, insists that, ``It is no longer an acronym.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the gradual transformation of ``Modern
Maturity,'' the AARP's magazine. A year ago, the cover featured
Betty White, 77, looking lovely but also, well, mature. The
headline was, ``Betty White, on Life, Loss and Laughter.'' This
month, the cover features Susan Sarandon, 52, looking like she
belongs in an issue that is, in fact, headlined, ``Great Sex _
What's Age Got to Do With It?''
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of sex, the AARP released a survey last week
focusing on the sexual satisfaction of Americans 45 and up. Before
the news conference began, the nation's largest senior citizens'
group played cuts from James Brown (``I Feel Good'') and Gladys
Knight and the Pips (``You're the Best Thing That Ever Happened to
Me'') stirring up latent memories of college mixers among the
assembled reporters, who proceeded to ask a flurry of questions
about frequency and potency.
</P>
<P>
   AARP officials made much of the fact that over-45 boomers were
still having sex and, by and large, would continue to have sex for
many years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Its officials make no secret of it: The AARP is trying to
retrofit itself for the baby boomers, the next great wave of the
aged, who began turning 50 three years ago and thus became eligible
for that fraught rite of passage, membership in the AARP.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the lobbying giant say they have no intention of
short-changing older members, who have more traditional
expectations of retirement and what they want from a senior
citizens' organization. (``We're not just showing people on the
cover who are 51 and 52 years old,'' said Martha Ramsey, publishing
director for the group.)
</P>
<P>
   But the boomers, those born from 1946 through 1964, are headed
inexorably through the life cycle, and the mighty AARP's struggle
to adjust says a lot about how they will remake paradigms of aging
and retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get the benefit or the burden, whichever way you see it, of
all the ambivalent feelings people have about aging,'' said John
Rother, the organization's chief lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the cultural collision between the boomers and what
Modern Maturity cheerfully calls the ``Big Five-Oh'' has launched a
thousand newspaper columns, essays, bad birthday greetings and
late-night monologues, including Jay Leno's ceremonial enrollment
of Mick Jagger, 56, into the AARP two weeks ago. (Leno produced a
mock version of Modern Maturity with Jagger on the cover, with
headlines like, ``From Rolling Stones to Kidney Stones'' and
``Can't Get No Satisfaction? Try Bran Muffins.'')
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is some evidence that the boomers are simply
denying the passage of time. A recent poll found that while the
median age of the boomers is now 42, the typical boomer says he or
she feels about 35.
</P>
<P>
   But polling done for the AARP and others suggests that boomers
are, in fact, beginning to think about their golden years _ and in
a very distinctive way. To begin with, lest you wonder why the AARP
moved away from the word ``retired,'' 80 percent of the boomers say
they expect to continue working during ``retirement,'' either part
time, full time in a new career or by going into business for
themselves, according to a 1998 poll by Roper Starch Worldwide for
the AARP. And more than a third say they will be doing that
primarily for ``interest and enjoyment.'' (Even now, 40 percent of
AARP's members are still working.)
</P>
<P>
   Only a fifth of the boomers expect to move to a new geographic
area when they retire _ in contrast with the previous generation's
dream of a mass exodus to Florida _ and only a third think they
will have to scale back their lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   Big majorities say they expect to live longer than their
parents' generation, and that awareness makes a difference, said
Dr. James Birren, associate director of the UCLA Center on Aging.
``Boomers are thinking more about how they want to invest all those
years of the future as opposed to getting through them,'' he said.
Many of the previous generation, he added, simply did not
anticipate living as long as they have.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Peter Hart agreed that while boomers might expect to
live 25 years after retirement, the previous generation probably
anticipated five to 10.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Dychtwald, the president of Age Wave, a research
organization and business focused on the ``mature market,'' argues
that boomers will live a ``cyclical lifestyle'' _ ``going back to
school, having multiple careers, retiring, rehiring.'' He added,
``They will not accept old age at all.'' Previous generations, the
49-year-old Dychtwald said, lived ``linear lives'' _ from work to
rest to death.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Delehanty, the 50-year-old new editor of Modern Maturity,
said he senses a hunger among the boomers for a ``new paradigm for
life after 50,'' a way of thinking about the next career or the
next work life. Delehanty, who once edited the Utne Reader, a
leftist, boomer-oriented digest of the alternative press, said he
plans a future issue of Modern Maturity on ``How to Reinvent Your
Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Boomers are also more health and fitness conscious, analysts
say. And, not surprisingly, they tend to be more anti-authority,
more skeptical of government, more interested in ``empowerment''
and ``choice.'' As Deets puts it: ``They want to make their own
decisions. They don't want to be told what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What does all this mean for the 41-year-old AARP, which claims
more than 30 million members? Officials say they are doing a lot of
strategic planning these days, and a lot of research on the
diversity of the boomer generation.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, long known for its insurance products as well
as its formidable defense of Social Security and Medicare on
Capitol Hill, recently spun off a subsidiary to explore new
services and products for the over-50 population. And its magazine,
which has long published different versions for the working and
retired set (the sex report appeared in both), may be doing more
such demographically zoned editions in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Dychtwald, a critic of the AARP, asserts that the senior group
will have a hard time serving both the old old and the new old.
</P>
<P>
   ``One is worried about fixed incomes and entitlements, the other
is worried about paying for their kids' education and elder care
and mutual funds,'' he said. ``Can AARP maintain their relationship
with their core constituency, who are likely to be retired
grandparents with a lot of free time, who are very respectful of
government, while simultaneously trying to be irreverent,
anti-authority, hip and modern?''
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic pollster Mark Mellman argues that the boomers
will be traditionalists in one respect: their support for those New
Deal-Great Society entitlement programs. ``They are pro-Medicare
and pro-Social Security, for themselves and for their parents,''
Mellman said.
</P>
<P>
   Celinda Lake, another Democratic pollster, said the 50-to-64 age
group is ``more adamant'' about strengthening and protecting those
programs than any other.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying question, of course, is how much old age will
change the boomers, and how much the boomers will change old age.
Meanwhile, time stops for no generation. Welcomed into ``The Big
Five-Oh'' club in the latest issue of Modern Maturity were Annie
Leibovitz, Twiggy and, the headliner of this summer's big rock
tour, Bruce Springsteen.

AARP AND THE NEW OLD: THE RETIREMENT LOBBY GOES VA-VA-BOOM! 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By ROBIN TONER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First there was the name change. The American
Association of Retired Persons is no longer the American
Association of Retired Persons. It is AARP, and Horace Deets, its
executive director, insists that, ``It is no longer an acronym.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the gradual transformation of ``Modern
Maturity,'' the AARP's magazine. A year ago, the cover featured
Betty White, 77, looking lovely but also, well, mature. The
headline was, ``Betty White, on Life, Loss and Laughter.'' This
month, the cover features Susan Sarandon, 52, looking like she
belongs in an issue that is, in fact, headlined, ``Great Sex _
What's Age Got to Do With It?''
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of sex, the AARP released a survey last week
focusing on the sexual satisfaction of Americans 45 and up. Before
the news conference began, the nation's largest senior citizens'
group played cuts from James Brown (``I Feel Good'') and Gladys
Knight and the Pips (``You're the Best Thing That Ever Happened to
Me'') stirring up latent memories of college mixers among the
assembled reporters, who proceeded to ask a flurry of questions
about frequency and potency.
</P>
<P>
   AARP officials made much of the fact that over-45 boomers were
still having sex and, by and large, would continue to have sex for
many years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Its officials make no secret of it: The AARP is trying to
retrofit itself for the baby boomers, the next great wave of the
aged, who began turning 50 three years ago and thus became eligible
for that fraught rite of passage, membership in the AARP.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the lobbying giant say they have no intention of
short-changing older members, who have more traditional
expectations of retirement and what they want from a senior
citizens' organization. (``We're not just showing people on the
cover who are 51 and 52 years old,'' said Martha Ramsey, publishing
director for the group.)
</P>
<P>
   But the boomers, those born from 1946 through 1964, are headed
inexorably through the life cycle, and the mighty AARP's struggle
to adjust says a lot about how they will remake paradigms of aging
and retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get the benefit or the burden, whichever way you see it, of
all the ambivalent feelings people have about aging,'' said John
Rother, the organization's chief lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the cultural collision between the boomers and what

IN WASHINGTON, COMPROMISE TAKES A HOLIDAY

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress went home for the August recess late last
week with little to show for itself beyond an arsenal of political
sound bites stockpiled to serve as campaign themes for a
high-stakes election that is still more than a year away.
</P>
<P>
   The achievements of the 106th Congress so far are scant _ mainly
a measure giving states more flexibility in using federal education
funds and another requiring deployment of a national missile
defense system. And across an array of fronts, Republicans and
Democrats seem more interested in campaigning than legislating.
</P>
<P>
   For example, President Clinton is so certain to kill the
far-reaching $792 billion tax cut passed by the Republican Congress
that its leaders decided not to send it to him until after Labor
Day so that he would not be able to make a showy White House
ceremony out of vetoing it while lawmakers were away. Republicans
nonetheless were elated that they had used the tax cut bill as a
way to distinguish themselves from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a dramatic difference between Republicans and
Democrats in this capital city,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas,
``and this is the dividing line.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislation to regulate the managed care industry passed the
Senate but has yet to make it to the House floor because of
Republican fears that they could lose control and give the
Democrats a victory on the issue. Despite the school shootings in
Littleton, Colo., another school year will open without any new gun
control measures. And although Clinton has proposed restructuring
Medicare and adding a new prescription drug benefit, the issue has
simply drifted into the fall.
</P>
<P>
   It's still early to make any definitive judgments about this
Congress, and some grand political bargain on tax cuts, spending
and Medicare might yet materialize in the fall. But at the moment,
compromise does not seem to be in the air. Some lawmakers are
despairing at the focus on political point-scoring in the
all-campaign-all-the time Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep saying, `the election,''' said Sen. Olympia Snowe,
R- Maine. ``And I say that's a year and a half from now. In the
meantime could we just sort of legislate?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it has been said that in a democracy the people get the
government they deserve. The voters put in place a recipe for
gridlock when they elected a Democratic president, a Republican
Senate and a House nominally in Republican control but actually
divided nearly in two.
</P>
<P>
   Issues like gun control and health care are complicated and
emotional. Sorting out what the nation's fiscal priorities should
be across a decade that is expected to bring in a $3 trillion
surplus is a profound political decision with far-reaching
consequences. So it's no wonder that the two parties want to fight
out their differences in the 2000 campaign in hopes that next
year's election _ unlike the last presidential year of 1996 _ will
help settle some of the arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had a surplus of the magnitude projected, at least
in my lifetime,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle.
``There's a legitimate philosophical debate over what you do with
it,'' he said. ``This is the noise of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some might say the tenuous balance of power is a sign to
Congress and the president that they should compromise. And they
briefly did, after the bruising 1995 fight over budget priorities
that led to the government shutdown, and after the inconclusive
1996 election. Unable to carry a Democratic Congress into office
with him, Clinton began his second term pledging to build a ``vital
center'' in U.S. politics. Republicans, chastened by their failure
to capture the White House, said they would cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later there was Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton
standing side by side on the White House lawn celebrating a
bipartisan milestone: a plan to balance the budget and cut taxes in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   But the spirit of compromise was short-lived. No matter how much
Clinton has tried to create a ``New Democrat'' or George W. Bush
looks for his own way as a ``compassionate conservative,'' the
partisan divisions in Congress have only been widening.
</P>
<P>
   The reapportionment of 1990 left many congressional districts
safely Republican and others overwhelmingly Democratic, giving most
House members little need to search for a center ground. The
Democrats who were once willing to vote with Ronald Reagan have
become Republicans. Liberal Republicans are almost extinct.
</P>
<P>
   Low voter participation in mid-term elections has also pushed
Republicans and Democrats, most particularly in the House, to cater
to their most devoted core voters and donor base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasingly Congress has become polarized,'' said Marshall
Wittmann, a congressional analyst at the conservative Heritage
Foundation. ``This has been a long-term development over the last
20-odd years. What you essentially have is a conservative party
versus a liberal party.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is that even when the two parties sound alike, their
rhetoric masks profound differences. Democrats say they support a
tax cut too _ just a smaller one than the Republicans. But most
Democrats put their passions into new programs like one to help
with school construction or a new Medicare prescription drug
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   And while Senate Republicans came up with a ``Patients' Bill of
Rights Plus'' to counter the Democrats ``Patients' Bill of
Rights,'' the Republican managed care bill was so much weaker than
the Democrats' version that it almost seemed to highlight the
Republicans' aversion to government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   It would take a reservoir of trust and good will to find a way
around such differences. But the impeachment battle left trust
between the parties in short supply. And the razor-thin majority in
the House has made matters worse: The parties judge every issue by
its likely effect on the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   So Democrats accuse Republicans of passing a large tax cut to
create a campaign issue. Republicans insist that Democrats are
blocking bills, like a Republican version of gun control, because
they want to run against a do-nothing Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers still try to swim against the tide. One
bipartisan group in the House reached agreement on a managed care
bill Thursday, hours before Congress recessed.
</P>
<P>
   As they announced the details in the late afternoon heat
Thursday outside the Capitol, Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., said,
``Let's put the election of 2000 where it belongs _ November 2000.
Today let's work on issues that face every American. ''
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed like a throwback to another era.

Republicans' aversion to government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   It would take a reservoir of trust and good will to find a way
around such differences. But the impeachment battle left trust
between the parties in short supply. And the razor-thin majority in
the House has made matters worse: The parties judge every issue by
its likely effect on the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   So Democrats accuse Republicans of passing a large tax cut to
create a campaign issue. Republicans insist that Democrats are
blocking bills, like a Republican version of gun control, because
they want to run against a do-nothing Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers still try to swim against the tide. One
bipartisan group in the House reached agreement on a managed care
bill Thursday, hours before Congress recessed.
</P>
<P>
   As they announced the details in the late afternoon heat
Thursday outside the Capitol, Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., said,
``Let's put the election of 2000 where it belongs _ November 2000.
Today let's work on issues that face every American. ''
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed like a throwback to another era.

   On Wolcott Street in Waterbury, Conn., on a recent afternoon
earth-movers prowled the wreckage of the Naugatuck Valley Mall,
scooping up the rubble of what was once the main shopping center
there. For miles on either side, roadside signs announce Arby's,
Shop-Rite, Sleepy's the Mattress Professionals _ today's typical
suburban vista.
</P>
<P>
   But now dead or dying shopping centers are also typical. It's
known as ``going dark,'' the theatrical term that seems
particularly apt given the April closing of the Galleria Mall, in
Sherman Oaks, Calif., where ``Valley Girls'' and ``Fast Times at
Ridgemont High'' were filmed. In Fishkill, N.Y., the once vibrant
Dutchess Mall is ailing. Payless Shoes, Deb Shops and Foot Locker
are among the few remaining tenants.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Gibbs, a retail consultant and urban planner from
Birmingham, Mich., who is regularly on the road monitoring these
things for cities and developers, estimates that there are 500 to
1,000 ghost shopping centers in the country.
</P>
<P>
   To observers of this changing scene, such ferment seems natural.
``Babylon was done in in part by certain conquerors who sacked
it,'' says William W. Hallo, the Laffan Professor of Assyriology at
Yale University. ``But what really did it in was the location of
new capital cities in close proximity that undercut the economic
base for its prosperity. This happened all over the ancient
world.''
</P>
<P>
   And it went on happening, not only with cities but also with the
buildings within them and now with the malls beyond, which were
created in the image of downtown centers. Witold Rybczynski, who
chronicled the history of shopping centers in ``City Life: Urban
Expectations in a New World'' (Touchstone, 1996), says it is part
of the nature of any building to have a life cycle that ends in
obsolescence. Shopping centers are no exception. ``They've been
around in various forms since the turn of the century,'' he said,
``and they've evolved, they've changed a lot over that time.'' The
early town centers that mixed shops with apartments were followed
by hybrids of strip centers and enclosed malls, including today's
neo-traditional town centers that some planners see as an antidote
to suburban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, where a mall has failed, a bigger, more
state-of-the-art shopping mecca looms on the horizon. ``You
remember that movie `One Million B.C.,' with Victor Mature as a
caveman?'' asks James Howard Kunstler, whose book, ``The Geography
of Nowhere'' (Touchstone, 1994), helped establish him as an
outspoken proponent of the New Urbanism, a design movement to
restore a sense of community to cities and suburbs. ``Well, at one
point the cavemen are sort of cringing in the foreground while
these two dinosaurs battle it out in the background, and in the end
one of them has his feet up in the air and he's dead. And this is
pretty much the mall situation in American towns. The citizens are
standing around like the cringing cavemen watching these monsters
battle each other for world domination. Of course, behind it all we
know they're both headed for extinction anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Shopping centers, some critics feel, have reached their
saturation point. The new mall threatening the old one is perhaps
symptomatic of a much larger problem _ ``too much shopping space
per American,'' Rybczynski says. That includes cyberspace and the
incalculable square footage that mail order catalogs would take up
if laid end to end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will always be malls,'' Gibbs said, ``but fewer
of them. And they will face greater competition'' _ in some cases
from downtown blocks that developers, in an interesting about-face,
have remodeled to mimick malls.
</P>
<P>
   David Livshin, president of the Dagar Group Ltd., which manages
the Dutchess Mall, admits that the sight of it ``sitting there
basically on life support'' could be viewed as a harbinger of
suburban decay. Instead, this 70 acres of interstate-front property
is a new frontier, ready to be reconfigured, Livshin says, with
offices, retail stores, restaurants, perhaps a conference center, a
gym and ``an interesting common area where people can sit.'' In
other words, he hinted at an environment akin to Gibbs' current
project at the defunct mall in Levittown, N.J. The new center will
have housing, a community college, a post office and about 2,000
square feet of retail shops.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, some failed malls are turning into industrial parks
and corporate or college campuses. Or they're being ``de-malled''
to create drive-up-to-the-door strip centers _ often anchored by
retailers like Walmart or Home Depot, which an increasing number of
shoppers find more convenient than the vast, multi-level centers
with miles of parking lots and walkways.
</P>
<P>
   What time-challenged shoppers want these days, Gibbs said, is
``to park close to the store and run in and run out without having
to go through the whole mall process.''
</P>
<P>
   An outdated center is easier and cheaper to recycle than, say,
the abandoned old brick mills or factories haunting some towns,
Rybczynski says. Their lightweight construction is an advantage in
restructuring them. Or in demolishing them. And, said Gibbs, who
prefers retrofitting to starting over, ``Local people generally
have a love and loyalty for the old mall. A lot of them grew up
there as kids, or they're senior citizens and raised their families
there, so they want to see it survive.'' Rybczynski says that
shopping centers have become a part of who Americans are and how
they live. Several are on the National Register of Historic Places,
including Highland Park Village in Highland Park, Texas, built
between 1931 and 1941, which is also a National Historic Landmark.
</P>
<P>
   But less distinguished examples of what architectural historians
now recognize as ``a distinctive American building type'' will
always be vulnerable to the vicissitudes of commerce and
demographics. ``The perception was, the mall's gone, now the area's
dead,'' said Rob Kane, who owns Kartele Cellular Phones near the
recently razed Naugatuck Valley Mall. ``We had to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Local merchants are aggressively promoting the area as the
``Magical Retail Mile.'' Although the nearby Barnes &AMP; Noble and
Toys ``R'' Us moved to Waterbury's brand-new regional mall, which
put the old one out of business, a new movie theater, a day care
center and a video store have opened here since the old mall's
demise. What will replace it is still undecided, but just the sight
of the rubble is ``progress,'' Kane said. ``It means there's
activity going on. It's not like when it was just sitting there,
empty.''

BRITAIN'S ECCENTRICS: THE STIFF UPPER LIP QUIVERS BEFORE AN
ECLIPSE

<P>
   LONDON _ When an eclipse brings night at mid-morning on
Wednesday in Cornwall, a county in southwestern England, there will
be a clear, predictable scientific explanation: The moon will
interpose itself between the Earth and the sun and a shadow will
fall on land for precisely two minutes and six seconds. Right?
</P>
<P>
   Well, up to a point.
</P>
<P>
   The full solar eclipse will be the first seen from Britain in 72
years and the last one of the millennium. But with little regard
for the obvious explanation, pagans, druids, doomsayers and New Age
travelers are anxiously awaiting the approach of the eclipse and
translating its portents in many ways, seeing divine felicity, the
end of the world _ anything except celestial science.
</P>
<P>
   And that says something about a nation whose John Bull
stereotype of proud pragmaticism seems challenged by this strain of
mysticism questing for alternative meanings. It is as if within the
soul of every bulldog Briton there lurked a secret doppelganger,
mistrustful of the scientifically obvious and craving mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Duality, of course, has always been an object of fascination
here: consider Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde or Dorian Gray, both
presenting one visage to the world while another corrodes from
within. And the rejection of science's road map for the universe
yields a seam of alternative thinking, from the Luddites who
protested the mechanization of the Industrial Revolution in the
early 19th century, to the activists who, three times in the past
couple of months, have torn up experimental crops to protest the
genetic modification of the food chain.
</P>
<P>
   While Americans cheerfully embrace the fruits of scientific
advance as the harbingers of future wealth and well-being _ from
bug-free soya to Internet stocks _ it could be argued that some
people in this much older nation with its great imperial history
look backward for their coordinates. In Cornwall this week, that
means a long, long way back _ back to the times when the Earth's
unlocked mysteries were an explanation in themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The eclipse is the big event, the end of an era,'' said Andy
Norfolk, a member of the pagan Cornish Earth Mysteries Group. ``We
find divinity in the natural world. The sun and moon are very
important. There is a great power when they come together like
this.'' Pagan worshipers plan a sun dance to ward off what the
science of meteorology says is a 50 percent chance of cloudiness on
the fateful day.
</P>
<P>
   And if that seems implausible, just consider the omens.
</P>
<P>
   The eclipse is set to begin at 11 minutes past 11 o'clock on the
11th day of the month. Coincidence? Or necromancer's compass
bearings? Plenty of people prefer the latter explanation. Take the
Cornish Eclipse Stone Festival, for instance, which runs one whole
week around the eclipse and is billed as ``a celebration of bikes,
blues, stones and druids.'' Or the Moonshadow Rising, a three-week
assembly of New Age travelers, who are Britain's anarchic, nomadic
successors to the hippie travelers of the 1960s; they are expected
to join the 1 million converging on the county.
</P>
<P>
   This wild blossoming of mysticism is probably because the
70-mile-wide track of ``totality,'' as the complete blotting out of
the sun is known, will cross a county readily linked with the
supernatural. ``There's a mystical strain in every country and
eclipses are likely to bring that out,'' said Richard Dawkins,
professor of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford
University. ``But Cornwall has a certain association with pixies,
fairies and standing stones and so it's fairly normal for people to
gravitate towards Cornwall.''
</P>
<P>
   But the last total eclipse in Britain, in 1927, was over the
bleak Yorkshire moors, which are not especially known for
mysticism, and it inspired the same awe and hype: Special trains
were scheduled, then as now, thousands converged on the track of
totality, including, most famously, Virginia Woolf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had very strongly the feeling as the light went out of some
vast obeisance; something kneeling down and suddenly raised up when
the colors came,'' she wrote in her diary. When the sun re-emerged,
she said, ``It was like recovery . . . We had seen the world
dead.'' Even hard-nosed newspapermen grew mystical. The London's
Daily Mail reported: ``It was just as if the light of the sun had
been extinguished for ever and the end of the world was at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Awe seems an appropriate emotion. ``It will be right to be awed
by the eclipse, and to draw on ideas from religion, myth and
literature,'' said John Casey, an academic at Cambridge University.
``It will be much healthier than all the Nostradamus and New Age
noodledom that has afflicted us with the approach of the third
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   But Britain's alternative strain is not driven simply by awe.
Environmental protesters routinely barricade themselves in trees or
caves to prevent the building of new highways and airports. In
June, druids converging on Stonehenge found their celebration of
the summer solstice disrupted by New Age travelers and anarchists
protesting the introduction of entrance fees to the site.
</P>
<P>
   The same month, anarchists who had promised only a day of street
carnivals in London's financial district instead trashed investment
banks and exchanges, baited, it was reported, by hot-shot
derivatives traders taunting them by waving gold credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   The same people have printed fliers advertising similar action
this week, calling for an ``anarchy jamboree'' in the Cornish town
of Penzance, targeting such disparate icons of capitalism as
McDonald's and organized rock concerts. ``Pay for absolutely
nothing. Help yourselves from corporate retailers,'' the leaflets
say, calling for a so-called dance-a-thon with ``lots of happy
people smashing up all the cars via the medium of dance.'' Mammon
is not the only target.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the outcry against genetically modified crops _ and the
readiness of protesters to risk arrest by uprooting them _ that the
authorities have decided to keep their location secret in future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's clearly a lot of Ludditism and you see it in all the
hysteria about every scientific story,'' said Dawkins.
</P>
<P>
   This being Britain, though, John Bull's dogged pragmatism can be
expected to stand four square against such distractions, fusing
Britain's sundered soul into one single motif: profit. For
instance, two British Airways Concorde airliners flying in
formation 10 miles up and at 1,350 miles per hour will pursue the
track of totality as it speeds across the Atlantic, enabling
eclipse junkies to keep the darkened sun in sight for six minutes
instead of the terrestrial two _ blending science and superstition,
the supernatural and the supersonic, at a mere $2,500 a head.

she said, ``It was like recovery . . . We had seen the world
dead.'' Even hard-nosed newspapermen grew mystical. The London's
Daily Mail reported: ``It was just as if the light of the sun had
been extinguished for ever and the end of the world was at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Awe seems an appropriate emotion. ``It will be right to be awed
by the eclipse, and to draw on ideas from religion, myth and
literature,'' said John Casey, an academic at Cambridge University.
``It will be much healthier than all the Nostradamus and New Age
noodledom that has afflicted us with the approach of the third
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   But Britain's alternative strain is not driven simply by awe.
Environmental protesters routinely barricade themselves in trees or
caves to prevent the building of new highways and airports. In
June, druids converging on Stonehenge found their celebration of
the summer solstice disrupted by New Age travelers and anarchists
protesting the introduction of entrance fees to the site.
</P>
<P>
   The same month, anarchists who had promised only a day of street
carnivals in London's financial district instead trashed investment
banks and exchanges, baited, it was reported, by hot-shot
derivatives traders taunting them by waving gold credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   The same people have printed fliers advertising similar action
this week, calling for an ``anarchy jamboree'' in the Cornish town
of Penzance, targeting such disparate icons of capitalism as
McDonald's and organized rock concerts. ``Pay for absolutely
nothing. Help yourselves from corporate retailers,'' the leaflets
say, calling for a so-called dance-a-thon with ``lots of happy
people smashing up all the cars via the medium of dance.'' Mammon
is not the only target.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the outcry against genetically modified crops _ and the
readiness of protesters to risk arrest by uprooting them _ that the
authorities have decided to keep their location secret in future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's clearly a lot of Ludditism and you see it in all the
hysteria about every scientific story,'' said Dawkins.
</P>
<P>
   This being Britain, though, John Bull's dogged pragmatism can be
expected to stand four square against such distractions, fusing
Britain's sundered soul into one single motif: profit. For
instance, two British Airways Concorde airliners flying in
formation 10 miles up and at 1,350 miles per hour will pursue the
track of totality as it speeds across the Atlantic, enabling
eclipse junkies to keep the darkened sun in sight for six minutes
instead of the terrestrial two _ blending science and superstition,
the supernatural and the supersonic, at a mere $2,500 a head.

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Have we _ that is, Americans _ got a really
serious problem with the rest of the world?
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade or so, significant numbers of countries
have been signing on to one treaty or convention after another
aimed at reining in abusive regimes, ending the mistreatment of the
weak and cutting back on the proliferation of all kinds of weapons
from nuclear bombs to land mines.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, even while participating in the writing of another
pact, has reacted with diminishing enthusiasm in the White House,
unease in the Pentagon and mounting outrage in Congress, always on
the lookout for invasions of U.S. sovereignty to beat back.
</P>
<P>
   Withholding U.S. backing for international pacts sometimes puts
the United States in decidedly mixed company. Only two nations are
holding out against the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the
United States and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   When 120 nations agreed last year to set up a permanent
International Criminal Court for the future Hitlers, Pol Pots and
Saddam Husseins of the world, Washington was one of seven
dissenters. The others were China, Iraq, Israel, Libya, Qatar and
Yemen.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cold War reduced to history and only one superpower
left, it seems to some politicians that foreigners, most of them
not reliable friends, want to tie this Gulliver down with
Lilliputian ropes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a healthy skepticism across the political spectrum
about what direction these treaties can take,'' said Ian Vasquez of
the Cato Institute in Washington. ``Another healthy attitude is
that the United States does not sign on to multilateral treaties in
a casual way, which I do think occurs in other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans reckon that many nations ratify agreements they have
no intention of abiding by, although this does not stop their
leaders from trying to use them against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   However, beyond U.S. borders the view is different. Canadian
officials, for example, lose no opportunity to chide Washington for
its failure to pay American assessments to the United Nations, a
situation that rankles worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the United States committed to multilateralism or not?'' a
Middle Eastern envoy asked last week. ``We need American
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Now two unresolved issues are prompting new looks at U.S.
attitudes toward international covenants. One is arms control. Last
week, a commission of disarmament experts from around the world
warned that American reluctance to ratify a pact against nuclear
testing, or to press Moscow for further mutual reductions in
strategic weapons, or to give full attention to deteriorating
relations with Russia and China, was creating an atmosphere of
insecurity worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Japanese-backed commission found,
Washington was whittling away inspection safeguards in the Chemical
Weapons Convention and lagging in commitments to tighten
international rules against biological weapons. The United States
has also opted out of an international convention banning the
production or use of land mines, killers of millions of the world's
poorest people caught in the most brutal of civil wars.
</P>
<P>
   The second battleground is the International Criminal Court.
Three weeks of talks are going on now at the United Nations to
clarify details about the court's operations. Most diplomats,
including Americans, are convinced that the court is likely to be
up and running in a matter of a few years, replacing the ad hoc
tribunals for the Balkans and Rwanda. The question is, where will
the United States be then?
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing now is a trend that was exemplified by the
U.S. opposition to and isolation on the convention to ban
antipersonnel mines,'' said Richard Dicker, associate counsel of
Human Rights Watch. ``On the Convention on the Rights of the Child,
it has to do with the military recruitment of individuals less than
18 years of age, and the U.S. Department of Defense does recruit
some 17 year olds. It's for that military, Pentagon-driven reason
that the United States has put itself in opposition to everyone in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   This predicament is not entirely without precedent. ``It took 40
years for the U.S. to ratify the Genocide Convention,'' Dicker
said. ``It took 25 years for the U.S. to ratify the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. This is part of a broader
issue, and it's particularly concentrated or crystallized in the
case of the International Criminal Court, because here what you
have is the creation of a new judicial body that would extend the
rule of law in its broadest conception.''
</P>
<P>
   For U.S. officials, that is exactly the problem: the specter of
a sweeping judicial process outside U.S. control with the potential
to interfere with U.S. policy decisions, especially when waging war
or sending troops abroad on international missions short of combat.
This is the treaty that Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has preemptively declared
``dead on arrival'' in Congress, if and when it shows up for
ratification.
</P>
<P>
   David Scheffer, the Clinton administration's ambassador at large
for war crimes, has met dozens of government delegations at the
United Nations over the last two weeks in his effort to persuade
foreign capitals that Washington is not uniformly opposed to an
International Criminal Court, but that U.S. concerns about its
reach and the risk it could pose if used politically against the
United States and, more particularly, American soldiers will have
to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   His arguments represent a classic American caution about
entangling foreign alliances _ in this case a treaty that will
change the face of international criminal law, and could involve
Americans whether or not they are party to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot sign the present text of the treaty,'' Scheffer
said. ``We've made that very clear. But we also want to engage very
constructively with other governments to see if there is a pathway
for our support.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of governments recognize that if the United States can
be brought on board, the treaty, in a pragmatic sense, can be
greatly strengthened, he said, ``because we can bring our
resources, our enforcement capabilities, our diplomatic skills, and
so much of what we provide to the ad hoc tribunals.''
</P>
<P>
   If this campaign doesn't work, the isolation of the United
States, for all its power, can only grow, and with it a distrust of
U.S. motives now that Washington stands above the world.
</P>
<P>
   Anne-Marie Slaughter, director of graduate and international
legal studies at the Harvard Law School, prepared a hypothetical
memo to the president on the options, pro and con, open to the
United States in a recent study for the Council on Foreign
Relations. She noted that in the wake of the bombing of Serb
targets and the occupation of Kosovo, ``the apparent conflict
between our humanitarian justification for NATO action and our vote
against the ICC in July 1998 feeds suspicion and confusion about
our foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, she added: ``Beyond Kosovo, our position on
the court will affect our ability to exercise leadership in shaping
the international order for the next century.''

TEACHERS' PAY: ADDING UP THE IMPACT OF RAISING SALARIES

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The news that two-thirds of New York City's fourth-graders
failed a state reading test was embarrassing. The results,
announced in May, followed too many other tests with unhappy
results, including one in which American eighth-graders ranked
below South Korea, the Czech Republic and two dozen other countries
in math and science performance.
</P>
<P>
   Ask a teacher what needs to be done to improve such dismal
performance, and it's a good bet the first answer will be to raise
teachers' salaries, thereby attracting and keeping better teachers.
</P>
<P>
   But there is scant evidence that higher salaries alone make a
difference in student performance. In fact, there is little
evidence that tinkering with any single element of the education
system does any good at all, when so many variables come into play,
like class size, curriculum, early childhood education, discipline,
homework and parental involvement, just to mention a few.
</P>
<P>
   But teachers' salaries seems always to top the list of problems,
perhaps because teachers' organizations make forceful arguments on
the issue. They say, for instance, that one thing is clear:
Beginning teachers usually earn less than other college graduates,
and that discourages many top-notch people from going into
teaching. Average starting pay for public school teachers
nationwide is $25,735, ranging from $19,146 in North Dakota to
$33,162 in Alaska. While the most experienced teachers in some
affluent suburbs earn more than $90,000 a year, the average salary
for teachers nationwide is $39,347 _ just a fraction of the annual
bonus received by many thirty-somethings on Wall Street. Just try
to raise a family or send a child through college on that amount,
many teachers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to improve the quality of our public schools,''
said Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, ``a major part of that is to make sure we can, to be
cliched, attract the best and the brightest, and you're not going
to do that without increasing salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to the higher status of teachers in Japan, advocates
say raising pay is a sine qua non to upgrade the status of American
teachers and to show that the nation is paying more than lip
service to improving education. What signal does it send about
teaching, many educators ask, when a 45-year-old teacher with a
masters degree earns $45,000 a year and a 25-year-old out of law
school often starts at $90,000?
</P>
<P>
   ``Teaching should be a profession, not a philanthropic act,''
said David Haselkorn, president of Recruiting New Teachers, a
nonprofit group that encourages college graduates to become
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   But many experts question whether raising teacher salaries, by
itself, will translate into better educational performance. And
some conservatives maintain that this push for higher pay is an
attempt by powerful teachers unions to line their members' pockets
at taxpayer expense.
</P>
<P>
   If you just increase salaries, it's going to buy you very
little,'' said Richard Murnane, a professor at Harvard's School of
Education. ``Right now, schools are not places where well-educated
college graduates want to work for very long. There is very little
collegiality, very little opportunity to work on projects with
other adults. It's a lonely job, and in many communities, it's seen
as very low status.''
</P>
<P>
   One argument that undermines the push for higher pay is the
experience of private and parochial schools, whose teachers are
generally paid less than public school teachers, but whose students
often out-perform public school students. At the nation's Catholic
schools, pay averaged $22,000 last year, 45 percent below the
public school average. At other private schools, teachers averaged
about $35,000, 11 percent below public school levels.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic school administrators say their schools perform well
notwithstanding their low salaries because their teachers are
dedicated, their curriculum is highly structured and discipline is
maintained. But many educators say Catholic schools often
outperform public schools largely because they are free to kick out
students who misbehave. Private schools often outdo public schools,
educators say, because they have smaller class sizes and student
bodies often culled from the nation's elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly our salaries are a lot lower, but the general
question is, will paying higher salaries produce better learning?''
said Leonard DeFiore, president of the National Catholic Education
Association. ``Everyone in the teaching profession hopes teachers
will get paid more, but whether that is correlated with more
learning is an open question. For most people who go into teaching,
money is not an issue. It's like in other helping professions _
it's what you want to do and you know you're not going to make a
lot of money doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   But for many teachers, money is definitely an issue. Take Daniel
Perez, a 27-year-old graduate of New York University with a
master's from Hunter College. After five years of teaching math at
a Queens intermediate school, he earns $38,600, but this fall he is
jumping to a Suffolk County high school where he will earn $47,900.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was OK to start at $28,000 when I was still living with my
parents, but it doesn't cut the mustard when you have a family or
want to own a home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New York City teachers often seize on Scarsdale's pay scale _ a
teacher with five years' experience and a master's degree earns
$60,000 versus $38,600 for a city teacher _ to argue that they
should earn far more because their jobs are harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the high-wealth suburbs, salaries are higher, working
conditions are better, facilities are newer, social conditions are
less impacted and class sizes tend to be lower,'' said Haselkorn of
Recruiting New Teachers. ``So urban districts tend to lose out all
the time in the bidding war for qualified teachers. That's a
scandal. You can't say that we're providing equal education
opportunities in this country when there are such imbalances
between low-wealth and high-wealth districts.''
</P>
<P>
   In arguing for higher pay, many education experts cite studies
showing that the nation, which has 2.7 million public school
teachers, will need to hire 2 million new teachers over the next
decade because of increased enrollment and a wave of retirements.
Another factor experts point to is that a generation or two ago,
many talented women and blacks entered teaching, despite the low
pay, because many other careers were closed off to them, but that
is no longer the case. Now they can go into engineering,
accounting, medicine or law, all of which pay considerably more
than teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Many educators say that if school districts raise teacher pay
while taking other steps like increasing expectations, cutting
class sizes and demanding more teacher training, then those steps,
taken together, will improve student performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think salaries in and of themselves are a magic
bullet, but they're an important piece in a larger puzzle,'' said
Haselkorn.

$33,162 in Alaska. While the most experienced teachers in some
affluent suburbs earn more than $90,000 a year, the average salary
for teachers nationwide is $39,347 _ just a fraction of the annual
bonus received by many thirty-somethings on Wall Street. Just try
to raise a family or send a child through college on that amount,
many teachers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to improve the quality of our public schools,''
said Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, ``a major part of that is to make sure we can, to be
cliched, attract the best and the brightest, and you're not going
to do that without increasing salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to the higher status of teachers in Japan, advocates
say raising pay is a sine qua non to upgrade the status of American
teachers and to show that the nation is paying more than lip
service to improving education. What signal does it send about
teaching, many educators ask, when a 45-year-old teacher with a
masters degree earns $45,000 a year and a 25-year-old out of law
school often starts at $90,000?
</P>
<P>
   ``Teaching should be a profession, not a philanthropic act,''
said David Haselkorn, president of Recruiting New Teachers, a
nonprofit group that encourages college graduates to become
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   But many experts question whether raising teacher salaries, by
itself, will translate into better educational performance. And
some conservatives maintain that this push for higher pay is an
attempt by powerful teachers unions to line their members' pockets
at taxpayer expense.
</P>
<P>
   If you just increase salaries, it's going to buy you very
little,'' said Richard Murnane, a professor at Harvard's School of
Education. ``Right now, schools are not places where well-educated
college graduates want to work for very long. There is very little
collegiality, very little opportunity to work on projects with
other adults. It's a lonely job, and in many communities, it's seen
as very low status.''
</P>
<P>
   One argument that undermines the push for higher pay is the
experience of private and parochial schools, whose teachers are
generally paid less than public school teachers, but whose students
often out-perform public school students. At the nation's Catholic
schools, pay averaged $22,000 last year, 45 percent below the
public school average. At other private schools, teachers averaged
about $35,000, 11 percent below public school levels.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic school administrators say their schools perform well
notwithstanding their low salaries because their teachers are
dedicated, their curriculum is highly structured and discipline is
maintained. But many educators say Catholic schools often
outperform public schools largely because they are free to kick out
students who misbehave. Private schools often outdo public schools,
educators say, because they have smaller class sizes and student
bodies often culled from the nation's elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly our salaries are a lot lower, but the general
question is, will paying higher salaries produce better learning?''
said Leonard DeFiore, president of the National Catholic Education
Association. ``Everyone in the teaching profession hopes teachers
will get paid more, but whether that is correlated with more
learning is an open question. For most people who go into teaching,
money is not an issue. It's like in other helping professions _
it's what you want to do and you know you're not going to make a
lot of money doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   But for many teachers, money is definitely an issue. Take Daniel
Perez, a 27-year-old graduate of New York University with a
master's from Hunter College. After five years of teaching math at
a Queens intermediate school, he earns $38,600, but this fall he is
jumping to a Suffolk County high school where he will earn $47,900.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was OK to start at $28,000 when I was still living with my
parents, but it doesn't cut the mustard when you have a family or
want to own a home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New York City teachers often seize on Scarsdale's pay scale _ a
teacher with five years' experience and a master's degree earns
$60,000 versus $38,600 for a city teacher _ to argue that they
should earn far more because their jobs are harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the high-wealth suburbs, salaries are higher, working
conditions are better, facilities are newer, social conditions are
less impacted and class sizes tend to be lower,'' said Haselkorn of
Recruiting New Teachers. ``So urban districts tend to lose out all
the time in the bidding war for qualified teachers. That's a
scandal. You can't say that we're providing equal education
opportunities in this country when there are such imbalances
between low-wealth and high-wealth districts.''
</P>
<P>
   In arguing for higher pay, many education experts cite studies
showing that the nation, which has 2.7 million public school
teachers, will need to hire 2 million new teachers over the next
decade because of increased enrollment and a wave of retirements.
Another factor experts point to is that a generation or two ago,
many talented women and blacks entered teaching, despite the low
pay, because many other careers were closed off to them, but that
is no longer the case. Now they can go into engineering,
accounting, medicine or law, all of which pay considerably more
than teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Many educators say that if school districts raise teacher pay
while taking other steps like increasing expectations, cutting
class sizes and demanding more teacher training, then those steps,
taken together, will improve student performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think salaries in and of themselves are a magic
bullet, but they're an important piece in a larger puzzle,'' said
Haselkorn.

   A friend recently noticed that I take one route going to the gym
and another coming home. That's good, she told me. It will make you
smarter. When I asked her why, she said scientists say that varying
the routine helps the brain sprout new nerve connections and that,
in turn, makes people more intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   At a dinner party last week, some of my friends were on a diet
that excluded potatoes, rice, bread and pastas. Those tasty foods,
they said, make people fat. Scientists say so.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so my friends may be a bit misinformed. These days it seems
that almost any scientific-sounding extrapolation for taking off
pounds or putting on IQ points can quickly gain a seal of approval
from public health groups or educators and help set policy for
untold years to come. Problems arise, though, when such
recommendations are launched without any scientific research.
</P>
<P>
   Just last Tuesday, 39 health organizations, including the
American Public Health Organization, signed a petition to the Food
and Drug Administration asking that food labels tell whether the
sugar content occurs naturally or is added; that the agency
recommend that Americans consume no more than 10 teaspoons of added
sugar a day, or half of what they now consume. ``Heavy consumption
of added sugar is contributing to soaring obesity rates,'' said Dr.
Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in
the Public Interest, a consumer health advocacy group in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, the American Academy of Pediatrics, citing
brain research, stated that children under 2 years old should not
watch television. Period.
</P>
<P>
   These events surprised both scientists who study obesity and
those who study brain development. Where, they demanded, are the
supporting data?
</P>
<P>
   There are no data establishing that Americans are getting fatter
because they are eating sugar, the researchers said. ``I don't
think there's any sound scientific basis to it at all,'' said Dr.
Jules Hirsch, an obesity researcher at Rockefeller University.
</P>
<P>
   Neuroscientists dismissed the American Academy of Pediatrics'
statement that television should be discouraged because ``research
on early brain development shows that babies and toddlers have a
critical need for direct interactions with parents and other
significant caregivers (e.g., child care providers) for health
brain growth and the development of appropriate social, emotional,
and cognitive skills.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no data like that at all,'' said Dr. Charles Nelson,
a professor of child psychology, neuroscience and pediatrics at the
University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven Petersen, a neurology professor at Washington
University Medical School in St. Louis, noted that not only was
there no brain research to back up the statement, but there was
also no logical reason to ban television for the very young. Why no
television as compared with one or two hours of it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Couldn't your child watch a little bit of TV and also get lots
of interactions with caregivers?'' Petersen asked. The academy's
stance, ``is like saying that tons and tons of junk food is bad and
so therefore kids should never have a hamburger.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marjorie Hogan, the lead author of the pediatric academy's
report, agreed that there are no studies with young children
showing actual brain changes occurring with television viewing.
``We extrapolated,'' Dr. Hogan said; the pediatricians used other
research to infer that children's brains are harmed when they spend
their time gazing at television screens instead of interacting with
humans.
</P>
<P>
   Those who extrapolate and make public health recommendations say
that they have to make a judgment call in deciding when there are
enough presumptive data to act. ``If we wait, we lose another
cohort of kids,'' Dr. Hogan said.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes well-intentioned advice is later revealed to be
based on hopes rather than facts. Those hopes can turn out to be
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Take the so-called Mozart effect, that well-varnished notion
that children who grow up listening to Mozart turn out smarter. The
idea was so entrenched that former Georgia Gov. Zell Miller
provided Mozart CDs to new mothers. Florida's public schools are
currently required to play classical music to toddlers daily.
</P>
<P>
   The science behind these two government practices was a study
involving college students _ not babies or toddlers. On tests of
special abilities the students did slightly better for 10 minutes
after listening to music by Mozart as compared to their performance
after listening to a relaxation tape or sitting silently for 10
minutes. No one tried to find out whether their brains were changed
or even whether Mozart's music in particular made the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart, in fact, had little to do with it, according to a new
study by Kristin Nantais of the University of Windsor in Canada and
E. Glenn Schellenberg of the University of Toronto at Mississauga.
Students did comparatively better on the test after listening to
Mozart's music, but they did just as well after listening to
Schubert or after simply listening to a story. The investigators
suggest that the negative effect may have been irritation or
boredom from hearing the stultifying relaxation tape or sitting
through 10 deadly minutes of silence.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mozart effect sounded so right to parents and
policy-makers. It had the same sort of intuitive zing as the alarms
over television viewing or sugar consumption. What could be wrong
with telling people to listen to classical music or to turn off the
television or cut back on sugar?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I just take umbrage at misstating science and taking
liberties with science,'' Nelson said. ``Then you open the door to
people saying anything they want to say under the guise of
science.''
</P>
<P>
   People can also open the door to bitter disillusionment when the
true facts emerge, he added. ``I can imagine a lawsuit five years
from now by some mother in Georgia saying, `Hey. I let my baby
listen to that Mozart CD and he's in jail now.'''

IT'S RAINING FARM SUBSIDIES

</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ City slickers may think there was some connection
between the withered cornstalks they saw on the nightly news last
week and the Senate's passing a $7.4 billion ``emergency''
agricultural aid bill Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is a crisis in American farming, but it has
little to do with this summer's drought, and a lot to do with
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Federal farm policy is creating bigger and bigger farms and
fewer and fewer farmers, converting tens of billions of taxpayers'
dollars into cattle fodder, creating big profits for the biggest
agribusinesses and underwriting cheap hamburgers. But that policy
is bringing precious little benefit _ and, some argue, great harm _
to small farmers trying to make a living, critics say.
</P>
<P>
   These critics include the conservative Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas,
the centrist National Farmers Union, which represents 300,000
farmers and ranchers, and the liberal Environmental Defense Fund.
Though they marshal their arguments in different ways, they
generally agree that a system begun back in the Depression to help
farmers survive is now ``planting a seed that is going to destroy
American agriculture as we know it,'' as Gramm said last week.
</P>
<P>
   The government will plow close to $24 billion into agriculture
this year, assuming the Senate bill becomes law. That federal money
will account for nearly half of all farm income, Agriculture
Department figures show. No other American business receives this
kind of subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   Very little federal largesse goes to small farmers growing food.
Most of it goes to the increasingly industrialized production of a
few basic commodities like wheat, soybeans and corn _ not the sweet
corn of summer, but the corn that animals eat. One-third of the
wheat, three-quarters of the corn and almost all the soybeans are
used for feed, not food.
</P>
<P>
   And much of the market for those commodities is controlled by
corporations like Cargill, the nation's largest privately held
company, and Archer-Daniels-Midland, the politically connected
conglomerate recently fined $100 million for price-fixing. These
two companies control 60 percent of the export market for American
grain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agriculture policy does not protect the person you or I think
of as a farmer,'' Tom Buis of the National Farmers Union said. ``It
benefits the largest operations and the processors. And the
processors want cheap grain. There are a lot of different interests
in agriculture, and the farmers are the least powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of small farmers _ those with annual gross incomes
below $250,000 _ has declined by 75 percent since the 1960s. With
tiny profit margins, farmers must have bigger farms, pricier
machines, more fertilizers, fence-to-fence plantings. Yet this
often gets them nowhere. Midwestern corn farmers' gross earnings
per acre are about the same as they were in 1950, though their
yields have doubled, Agriculture Department figures show.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to adapt or die, fewer farmers are running bigger and
bigger operations. Hog barns and chicken coops become huge meat
factories; these economies of scale affect farming and ranching
everywhere. Farmland is concentrated in fewer and fewer hands: Five
percent of the landowners now own 50 percent of all farmland.
</P>
<P>
   And just as no other industry gets the kind of federal subsidy
that agriculture does, no other industry suffers from
overproduction on the same scale. One big reason that prices are
plummeting is that farmers are growing too much. There is no market
for half this fall's wheat crop _ close to a billion bushels,
growers say.
</P>
<P>
   Federal farm law is contributing to that oversupply, the critics
say. The law was revised by the Republican Congress in 1996 to
remove the set-aside subsidy, which paid farmers to let part of
their fields lie fallow. The old law had many critics, but the
change ``accelerated this trend of overproduction,'' said Buis.
``It encouraged more production without any measures to control
supply.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Searchinger, a senior attorney at the Environmental Defense
Fund in Washington, said: ``The subsidies mean that farmers produce
too many basic crops, taxpayers pay them for the excess, and
farmers keep doing it. They mean millions more acres of corn and
wheat fields, more tons of fertilizer and pesticides.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Senate's new bill, the Agriculture Department
forecast farm income declining very slightly this year, from $44.1
billion last year to $43.8 billion. Congress, by passing a bill of
that size, would push the figure up above $50 billion _ with $24
billion coming from the Treasury. The same forecast shows the total
value of farm assets rising and farm debt declining this year.
</P>
<P>
   The new farm law was supposed to let the market rule. To an
extent, it has. The agribusiness giants like overproduction because
it keeps prices down. But Congress pumps more and more money into
the system _ including a $6 billion ``emergency'' package last
October along with the $7.4 billion offered by the Senate _ and the
total payout has been greater than or equal to what would have been
paid under the old law, according to Agriculture Department figures
cited by Searchinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are paying so much money that we are actually encouraging
more production rather than compensating people partially for their
losses,'' Gramm said. ``We are going to end up exacerbating
oversupply and driving prices further and further down.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a farm crisis, but it seems to be that the market,
supported by the government, is forcing America's small farmers to
get big or get out.

processors want cheap grain. There are a lot of different interests
in agriculture, and the farmers are the least powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of small farmers _ those with annual gross incomes
below $250,000 _ has declined by 75 percent since the 1960s. With
tiny profit margins, farmers must have bigger farms, pricier
machines, more fertilizers, fence-to-fence plantings. Yet this
often gets them nowhere. Midwestern corn farmers' gross earnings
per acre are about the same as they were in 1950, though their
yields have doubled, Agriculture Department figures show.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to adapt or die, fewer farmers are running bigger and
bigger operations. Hog barns and chicken coops become huge meat
factories; these economies of scale affect farming and ranching
everywhere. Farmland is concentrated in fewer and fewer hands: Five
percent of the landowners now own 50 percent of all farmland.
</P>
<P>
   And just as no other industry gets the kind of federal subsidy
that agriculture does, no other industry suffers from
overproduction on the same scale. One big reason that prices are
plummeting is that farmers are growing too much. There is no market
for half this fall's wheat crop _ close to a billion bushels,
growers say.
</P>
<P>
   Federal farm law is contributing to that oversupply, the critics
say. The law was revised by the Republican Congress in 1996 to
remove the set-aside subsidy, which paid farmers to let part of
their fields lie fallow. The old law had many critics, but the
change ``accelerated this trend of overproduction,'' said Buis.
``It encouraged more production without any measures to control
supply.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Searchinger, a senior attorney at the Environmental Defense
Fund in Washington, said: ``The subsidies mean that farmers produce
too many basic crops, taxpayers pay them for the excess, and
farmers keep doing it. They mean millions more acres of corn and
wheat fields, more tons of fertilizer and pesticides.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Senate's new bill, the Agriculture Department
forecast farm income declining very slightly this year, from $44.1
billion last year to $43.8 billion. Congress, by passing a bill of
that size, would push the figure up above $50 billion _ with $24
billion coming from the Treasury. The same forecast shows the total
value of farm assets rising and farm debt declining this year.
</P>
<P>
   The new farm law was supposed to let the market rule. To an
extent, it has. The agribusiness giants like overproduction because
it keeps prices down. But Congress pumps more and more money into
the system _ including a $6 billion ``emergency'' package last
October along with the $7.4 billion offered by the Senate _ and the
total payout has been greater than or equal to what would have been
paid under the old law, according to Agriculture Department figures
cited by Searchinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are paying so much money that we are actually encouraging
more production rather than compensating people partially for their
losses,'' Gramm said. ``We are going to end up exacerbating
oversupply and driving prices further and further down.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a farm crisis, but it seems to be that the market,
supported by the government, is forcing America's small farmers to
get big or get out.

   On a muggy Monday night in July, some 80,000 classical music
fans ignored forecast thundershowers and flocked to New York's
Central Park to enjoy the music of Dvorak and Tchaikovsky.
Meanwhile, businesses across North America are deploying similar
symphonies to drive people away.
</P>
<P>
   In tactics akin to psychological warfare, a growing number of
merchants, building owners and transit officials are switching on
the classics to scatter loiterers, especially teens. Criminologists
trace the trend to a 7-Eleven store in Victoria, British Columbia,
which began bombarding its parking lot with classical music in 1985
to dissuade teens from congregating. Margaret Chabris, a 7-Eleven
spokeswoman, says about 150 franchises have followed suit, as have
many other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying teens with classical gas seems out of synch with the
genre's growing acceptance by mass culture. After all, sales of
classical CDs rose nearly 20 percent in 1998. And in response to
recent (albeit controversial) studies suggesting that classical
music stimulates brain development, Georgia and Tennessee now
dispense free classical CDs for newborns.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're noticing is a much broader use of orchestral music
on television, in advertising, and in public spaces,'' said John
Sparks, vice president of the American Symphony Orchestra League.
But he thought the idea of using classical music to disperse people
``says more about the person making that selection than the people
they're aiming at.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, recent experience suggests that the classical deterrent
is effective.
</P>
<P>
   Before Bernie Naiman started booming ``Horowitz at the Met'' and
``La Traviata'' outside the commercial building he owns in downtown
Denver four years ago, he considered an adjacent outdoor plaza ``a
country club for bums.'' Sidewalk preachers in particular irritated
Naiman. ``Religious fanatics would scream unintelligible messages
from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m.,'' he said. ``It got so bad that our
tenants couldn't open their windows.'' His deejaying proved as
unpopular as intended; the preachers and most of the vagrants soon
vanished. ``The arias by Luciano Pavarotti really drove them
crazy,'' recalls Naiman.
</P>
<P>
   The aversion of teen-agers to what used to be called ``long-hair
music'' is well documented. A spree of wildings and a gang-related
murder in 1996 prompted the Toronto Transit Commission to pipe
classical pieces like Chopin's ``Fantasie-Impromptu in C Minor''
into Kennedy Station, long a hub for subways, buses and
troublemakers. ``The bottom line is that kids don't like classical
music,'' declared Mike Walker, the commission's chief security
officer, who plans to play the canned music at at least three more
stations next year.
</P>
<P>
   Bach's ``Lute Suite in A Minor'' alone won't eliminate muggings
or panhandling, says Ken Philmus, director of tunnels, bridges and
terminals for the Port Authority in New York. But that piece and
others play an important role in a comprehensive environmental
redesign at the Port Authority's midtown bus terminal that has made
the place less threatening. Before the overhaul in 1991, the
terminal's seediness was the butt of jokes by David Letterman. Then
the authority installed brighter lighting, opened up nooks where
the homeless camped, beefed up police patrols, brought in roving
social workers _ and introduced classical music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Classical music didn't stop muggings,'' Philmus said. ``What
it did was make people walking through the building say, `You know,
this place is different.''' Upon reflection, Philmus added: ``I'm
sure some folks decided, `I'm not going to loiter under this
speaker.'''
</P>
<P>
   As a piano concerto played in the background, a Port Authority
police officer, J.D. Levi, credited the music system's repetition
with dispersing derelicts. ``It's on a loop, so if you are standing
in one place it gets annoying,'' conceded Levi. ``Sometimes,'' he
joked, `` &UR; I  &LR; want to shoot the speakers.''
</P>
<P>
   His opinion was seconded by Chop, as he called himself, a young
man hanging out in front of the bus terminal's 42nd Street entrance
on a recent Friday evening. ``They need to change the music,'' he
griped. ``Anything but classical.''
</P>
<P>
   How about a little Perry Como? According to Tim Crowe, a
criminologist and author of ``Crime Prevention Through
Environmental Design,'' business owners must discern the dislikes
of the ``market'' they aim to annoy _ in much the same way that the
U.S. armed forces pursuing Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega figured that
blasting ``I Fought the Law'' over loudspeakers would bother the
Panamanian strongman when he was holed up at the Vatican embassy in
Panama City in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't play classical for the Goths _ they like ethereal
music,'' noted Crowe, referring not to the sackers of Rome but to
American youths known for wearing funereal black clothing and white
makeup.
</P>
<P>
   To discipline violators of the town's public noise ordinance,
Paul Sacco, a judge in Fort Lupton, Colo., mandates a medley of
classical and other styles of music. Once a month on a Friday
night, offenders arrested for blaring music from their cars undergo
a 90-minute music immersion class _ a sentence recalling ``A
Clockwork Orange,'' the Stanley Kubrick film in which the
authorities prop open a rapist's eyes and force him to watch scenes
of violence while listening to Beethoven. Sacco's play list of
punishment includes Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, Wayne Newton and
Barry Manilow tunes, bagpipe solos and the cruel and unusual theme
song from ``Barney.''
</P>
<P>
   No consensus exists on just why teenagers and classical music
don't mix. Perhaps they think of it as their parents' music. Or
maybe they didn't hear enough of it while rocking in the cradle.
Dr. William Anderson, a psychiatrist at Massachusetts General
Hospital, theorized that youths reared in an environment of
unpredictability and chaos would find classical music not terribly
pleasant, since it has predictable patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the notion that classical music can repel listeners
instead of entertain them saddens many concert-goers. At a recent
performance of Schumann at Lincoln Center in New York, Jeannine
Wilson, in a flowing purple chiffon skirt, was rueful. ``When I
think of classical music, I think of something beautiful, poetic,
invigorating,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And what would Mozart think of classical deterrence? She
brightened a bit: ``He'd be really excited. He composed music to
move people, and I guess it still does.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The answer isn't more guns
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   To listen to talk radio shows from around the country in the
days after the Atlanta massacre was to be very afraid for the
future of this country.
</P>
<P>
   For while there were individual exceptions and no doubt some
exceptional shows, too, the overwhelming cry was for more guns.
What this country needs is a citizenry armed and cocked to shoot.
To hear talk radio tell it, the sure-fire answer to gun play is
more gun play.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, you have to consider the medium. These blather shows exist
to stir the animals up by poking them in their cages with pointed
sticks.
</P>
<P>
   The scam hasn't moved much beyond the parody of it that comedian
George Carlin did two decades ago, as a desperate the talk jockey
screaming into the mike about the forced cross-town busing of
kittens and puppies for vivisection by communists _ and what do you
think of THAT?
</P>
<P>
   Even discounting for the incitement, there's an unnerving streak
of eager anarchy boiling just under the surface talk about law and
order.
</P>
<P>
   The common scenario holds that government is incompetent to
protect law-abiding citizens, so we must carry guns to work, the
mall, in traffic, indeed everywhere, to protect ourselves. And,
what is more, the government is, if not an active menace itself,
certainly a nascent one, always plotting _ and with such subtle
efficiency most citizens don't realize it _ to take away our
freedom. We must be ready to shoot it out with Washington, too.
</P>
<P>
   You may have noticed this makes no sense. The government that is
so fumbling it can't protect you is held simultaneously to be so
clever it can steal your freedom without you noticing. Well, what's
a little cognitive dissonance among friends?
</P>
<P>
   Not to put too fine a point on it, but this is the counsel of
hysterics and paranoids, and its very assertion inadvertently makes
a case for restraining the current wanton traffic in firearms. It
is difficult to see safety in a nation of hair-trigger
conspiratorialists.
</P>
<P>
   The government can't protect us for the simple reason that we've
created a country awash with some 200 million firearms. No other
nation pretending to civilization allows such an obvious precursor
for barbarism.
</P>
<P>
   So we ride the vicious circle. The more the shootings, the more
we are told we must arm. The more of us who are armed, the higher
the chances one of us, P.O.'d and brimming with firepower, will use
that protective weapon for terminal therapy, taking out co-workers,
passersby, whoever. So still more arm and...
</P>
<P>
   And so on.
</P>
<P>
   There is a chance for hope in all this. The noisiest among us _
along with the gun makers and gun lobby _ call for ever more
firearms, but most of us, and by a huge margin, sensibly would
rather have a less-armed nation.
</P>
<P>
   That majority, if it will shake off the stupefied fatalism the
gun-hucksters have nurtured, can reverse the domestic arms race
with common-sense controls. Neither fate nor the Constitution
requires us to cringe through life in an armed stand-off of mutual
fear.

KATIE HOLMES: `TEACHING,' BUT STILL LEARNING 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of Katie Holmes with Helen Mirren, Barry
Watson and Marisa Coughlan in a scene from ``Teaching Mrs.
Tingle.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Katie Holmes may be only 20, but she's learned a few tricks of
the trade.
 &HT;    About to do her first big-screen love scene, on the set of her
new movie, ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle,'' she handed co-star Barry
Watson a breath mint.
 &HT;    ``I just think love scenes are better with nice breath,'' she
says in a matter-of-fact tone.
 &HT;    Everything about Katie Holmes is nice, as far as anyone can
tell. She loves her mother and four siblings. She loves her
co-stars, her pets and her fans.
 &HT;    Why, even after she became a big-time television star, she not
only had a curfew from her parents _ she followed it.
 &HT;    ``Thank God I'm the youngest of five and I had older brothers
and sisters working for me,'' she says, sipping orange juice during
an interview at Manhattan's Essex House. ``They were even like,
`Mom, come on. Katie is a TV star, and she lives in North Carolina
for most of the year by herself.'''
 &HT;    Even so, she says, her parents wanted her back in that house of
her own by 12:30 a.m.
 &HT;    ``I usually complied,'' she says sheepishly.
 &HT;    She may be a dutiful daughter, but Holmes is no babe in the
woods. Her acting capabilities are vouched for by a most competent
authority: her ``Mrs. Tingle'' co-star, the British stage legend
Helen Mirren.
 &HT;    ``Katie was the consummate professional,'' Mirren says in a
separate interview. ``She is technically able as an actress, and
experienced. She is also the sweetest girl on this planet.''
 &HT;    It figures that in ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle,'' which will open
Aug. 20, Holmes plays a goody-two-shoes high-school honor student,
a working-class girl desperate to get a scholarship to college and
ditch her small-town life.
 &HT;    Her only obstacle is Mrs. Tingle (Mirren), an evil, spiteful old
hag of a teacher who wants her students to fail because she herself
never got out of town.
 &HT;    One thing leads to another, and soon Holmes and Watson have
kidnaped their teacher and are up to their necks in trouble.
 &HT;    With, of course, some time out for a little teen love.
 &HT;    Holmes is charmingly embarrassed about her first love scene.
 &HT;    ``It was just awkward to have all these Teamsters watch me take
my shirt off,'' she says, rolling her eyes, ``and they're just
standing there yawning and eating a doughnut.''
 &HT;    She also had a hard time getting into the mood with Watson, the
handsome heartthrob of television's ``7th Heaven.''
 &HT;    ``I mean, one minute we're eating Altoid mints and the next
we're supposed to be all in love and ripping each other's clothes
off?'' Holmes says, shaking her head. ``I guess I learned that love
scenes are not as easy as they look.''
 &HT;    More worrisome to her, however, is what her parents will say.
 &HT;    ``I showed my older brother Marty, who is a very intimidating
lawyer, a rough cut of the film,'' she says. ``And it was pretty
rough on him. He just shielded his eyes during the makeout part and
said, `Gross, you're my sister. I don't want to see this stuff.'
 &HT;    ``I'm worried about what my mother will think.''
 &HT;    Holmes grew up in Toledo, Ohio, daughter of a housewife and an
attorney. Life was fairly normal until her senior year of high
school, when Holmes and her mother found out about pilot seasons in
Los Angeles, in which young, unproven actors audition for new
television series.
 &HT;    Inspiration struck, and soon a video camera was set up in their
Toledo basement.
 &HT;    ``My mom and I would send for four scripts a month,'' Holmes
recalls, ``and we'd go downstairs and put me on tape. I would play
the teen, and my mother would play all the other parts.''
 &HT;    One of those tapes landed on the desk of Kevin Williamson,
creator of ``Dawson's Creek'' and director of ``Teaching Mrs.
Tingle.''
 &HT;    ``I pop in this videotape,'' he recalls in a separate interview,
``and it was just a girl in her basement playing Joey. Her mother
played Dawson. And it took about one minute for me to say, `Get her
in here to test for the network.'''
 &HT;    That was easier said than done, though, since Holmes was all set
for the school play, ``Damn Yankees.''
 &HT;    ``I was playing Lola. I even got to wear the feathered boa,''
the young actress says defensively. ``I thought, `There is no way
I'm not playing Lola to go audition for some network.' So I told
Kevin and the WB, `I'm sorry. I just can't meet with you this week.
The other kids at my school are counting on me.'''
 &HT;    ``Here is maybe the only girl on this planet who says, `My
friends mean more to me than being in this highly publicized TV
series,''' Williamson says, grinning. ``It was heartbreaking. So we
waited the week and then flew her out.''
 &HT;    Holmes got the role, and virtual overnight stardom in the
bargain. Besides the series, she also has a flourishing movie
career that has included roles in Ang Lee's ``The Ice Storm''
(1997), the horror movie ``Disturbing Behavior'' (1998) and the hip
drama ``Go'' (1999).
 &HT;    Next year she'll make her biggest film to date, the drama
``Wonder Boys.'' Moving up in the world, she'll play a college
freshman, one with a big crush on one of her professors (Michael
Douglas).
 &HT;    ``My character is a very strong, smart girl,'' Holmes says.
``She's savvy, but a little precocious. She also has some feelings
for Michael Douglas' character. Unfortunately they are not
returned.''
 &HT;    In real life, Holmes reportedly has some strong feelings of her
own for ``Dawson's'' co-star Joshua Jackson. When his name comes
up, she almost blushes and then heads for safe ground.
 &HT;    ``Actually,'' she says, ``I like to keep my personal life
personal.''
 &HT;    She may be playing a college student, and even have been
accepted into Columbia University in New York, but Holmes has put
her education on hold for the duration of ``Dawson's Creek.''
 &HT;    ``College is not something I look upon lightly,'' she says. ``I
want to give it my entire attention, and that's not possible right
now.
 &HT;    ``I will definitely stay with the show as long as it runs.''
 &HT;    And as long as she's there, fans will doubtless be buzzing about
the relationship between Joey and Dawson (James Van Der Beek),
currently on the outs on the show.
 &HT;    And then of course there's the biggest question about the
thus-far-unconsummated romance. Will Joey and Dawson ever go
R-rated?
 &HT;    ``Well,'' Holmes says, ``I'm a hopeless romantic, and I would be
upset if they didn't eventually get together in that way.''
 &HT;    A nervous smile plays on her lips.
 &HT;    ``I just hope my mom isn't watching that night.''

JAMES CAAN, MIRRORED TO THE MOB

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of James Caan in a scene from ``Mickey Blue
Eyes.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    James Caan will say anything.
 &HT;    To anyone, even the much-reviled press.
 &HT;    About anyone, even Hugh Grant, his co-star in the mob-themed
romantic comedy ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' and also his boss, since the
film was produced by Grant and Elizabeth Hurley.
 &HT;    ``Hugh's very nervous, very neurotic,'' Caan says with obvious
glee. ``He's very British, I guess. Him being British and me being
pretty New York, it was pretty funny.
 &HT;    ``I just kept him nervous all day long,'' Caan says. ``I'd tell
him lies. He was so easy, such an easy mark.
 &HT;    ``I saw him the other day after not seeing him for a while,''
the actor adds, ``and I said, `You're going to wear that shirt
today?' He goes, `What?' He called Elizabeth, `I've got to get
another shirt!'''
 &HT;    Caan guffaws.
 &HT;    Grant, on the other hand, can only shake his head, a smile
battling his scowl.
 &HT;    ``I can't believe the lack of respect shown by that man,'' he
says in a separate interview. ``We pluck him from his old-people's
home, give him a job and we get this crap?''
 &HT;    The British actor grins.
 &HT;    ``He's got wonderful spirit,'' Grant says, ``but a lot of it is
drugs, you have to remember.''
 &HT;    ``Mickey Blue Eyes,'' which will open nationwide on Aug. 20,
casts Caan as a New York gangster whose beloved daughter (Jeanne
Tripplehorn) gets engaged to a prim-and-proper British auctioneer
(Grant).
 &HT;    Grant and Hurley happened to run into Caan in New York while
they were in pre-production for the film, and it's no wonder that
the idea of casting him clicked immediately. After all, if you're
casting a Mafioso, why not a man who, despite a long and impressive
career, remains best known as Sonny Corleone in ``The Godfather''
(1972)?
 &HT;    ``I'm sure that Sonny Corleone had something to do with it, and
that's fine,'' Caan says during a interview at Manhattan's Regency
Hotel. Dressed casually in blue jeans, a plaid shirt and sneakers,
the actor is relaxed, effusive and, oh yes, ready to rattle off
language that would make a sailor blush.
 &HT;    If he tries, though, he can actually plug his film and even
dissect his performance in it.
 &HT;    ``Even though `Mickey Blue Eyes' is a comedy, I tried not to
play Frank any differently than I would a similar kind of character
in a drama,'' he says. ``The trick to comedy is concentrating a
little harder, because you have to walk through situations as if
everything is perfectly normal.
 &HT;    ``I believe that if you try to be funny, you usually aren't,''
he adds. ``If you play it straight and just be unaware of what's
happening around you, it becomes funny.
 &HT;    ``The accent is the same,'' he concludes. ``The mannerisms are
the same. This guy is loyal to his family and loyal to his other
Family, if you know what I mean, and trying to be loyal to both is
the problem. That's where the humor comes through.''
 &HT;    Everyone on the ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' set felt the same way, Caan
thinks, and the end result is a pretty amusing piece of
entertainment.
 &HT;    ``The intent here, as far as I was concerned, is that people
have a good time,'' he says. ``We're not curing cancer. It's not
`Hamlet.' There's no message.
 &HT;    ``If you wake up in the morning, don't even remember what you
saw, but know you had a good time, then I think it's successful.''
 &HT;    ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' is only the first installment in a virtual
Caan film festival. He has two more films due later in the year _
``The Yards,'' a drama with Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron and Faye
Dunaway, and ``The Way of the Gun,'' a crime saga with Ryan
Phillippe and Benicio Del Toro.
 &HT;    In fact, Caan's been on a roll since the early 1990s, after
hitting bottom at the box office with ``Bolero'' (1982) and ``Kiss
Me Goodnight'' (1982), a dismal doubleheader that in large part
contributed to a five-year absence from the screen.
 &HT;    The 1990s have been another story, however. His compelling
performance in ``Misery'' (1990) as a novelist held prisoner by a
deranged fan reminded Hollywood that he was still a talent to be
reckoned with, and he demonstrated his range in such diverse films
as the screwball comedy ``Honeymoon in Vegas'' (1992), the
brilliant-but-little-seen drama ``Flesh and Bone'' (1993), the
Arnold Schwarzenegger action picture ``Eraser'' (1996) and the
cable-television private-eye movie, ``Poodle Springs'' (1999).
 &HT;    Not that anyone ever doubted Caan's ability, at least not after
such early films as ``Brian's Song'' (1971), ``The Godfather,''
``Cinderella Liberty'' (1973) and ``Thief'' (1981). But it was no
secret that the actor had a major drug problem, one that made him
little more than an accident waiting to happen.
 &HT;    ``Of all the drugs in the world, cocaine was probably the worst
one I could have chosen,'' Caan says unblinkingly. ``I was never a
drinker _ I was a purist.
 &HT;    ``I'm hyper by nature,'' he says. ``People think I'm as high as
a kite anyway. In the old days, I'd do (cocaine) with the girls,
you know. Then all of a sudden it was a way of life _ and it came
at a time in my life when everything was good, too good.''
 &HT;    Caan's wakeup call came seven years ago, when his eldest son
Scott _ now an actor, with credits that include ``Varsity Blues''
(1998) _ was still only a teen-ager.
 &HT;    ``You always think you fool your kids _ that they don't know,
that they're stupid,'' he says. ``One night I was at some dope
dealer's place. I'd just gone upstairs.
 &HT;    ``And here comes Scott with a baseball bat. He was gonna kill
this guy,'' Caan says, misting up. ``I was kind of smiling out of
one eye and crying out of the other. I was so proud of him.
 &HT;    ``If there was one thing that probably straightened my butt out,
it was right there and then,'' the actor says. ``We all went
through it, and not everybody survived it.''
 &HT;    Caan survived it, and eventually got his act together. At 59,
he's married again and a father of five children.
 &HT;    ``I've got two new ones,'' he says. ``The youngest one is named
Viagra!''
 &HT;    Actually, the 9-month-old is named Jake. Then there's 3-year-old
Jimmy Jr., 7-year-old Alexander, 23-year-old Scott and 34-year-old
Tara.
 &HT;    ``I'm not a grandfather yet,'' Caan says. ``People are like,
`Oh, my mother loves you' or `My grandfather ... ' I'm like, `Get
out of here.'''
 &HT;    Caan can still play the maverick, but it's obvious that one of
Hollywood's legendary wild men has settled down more than somewhat.
 &HT;    ``I'm a little bit more at peace with myself,'' he says. ``I
went through my period of doing really destructive stuff, just
excessive behavior. I got so tired of being so tired _ that s--t
stinks.
 &HT;    ``I'm glad I can be there for the kids now, that they've got two
parents,'' he says. ``Two of the kids are even with the same
wife.''
 &HT;    He grins.
 &HT;    ``You see? I really am maturing.''

HALLE BERRY RE-INTRODUCES DOROTHY DANDRIDGE

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Halle Berry in a scene from
``Introducing Dorothy Dandridge.'') 
 By JEAN OPPENHEIMER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Hollywood in the 1940s and 1950s wasn't a good place to be
beautiful, talented and black _ especially for actresses, who were
usually limited to playing domestics or jungle queens.
 &HT;    Times have changed, of course, and today Halle Berry is one of
an increasing number of black leading ladies who have earned
respect _ and solid box-office numbers _ in the movie industry.
 &HT;    Berry thinks the biggest single link between then and now was
Dorothy Dandridge, the gifted singer/actress who became the first
black woman ever nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award for her
performance in ``Carmen Jones'' (1954). But despite her one-time
fame _ she was also the first black woman to grace the cover of
Life magazine _ today Dandridge is virtually unknown.
 &HT;    Berry hopes to change that with ``Introducing Dorothy
Dandridge,'' an HBO movie airing on Aug. 21, in which she does
double duty as star and producer.
 &HT;    Making the film was a crusade for Berry, who has starred in such
films as ``Executive Decision'' (1997), ``Why Do Fools Fall in
Love'' (1998) and ``Bulworth'' (1998).
 &HT;    ``Getting this movie made has been my waking thought for six
years,'' the actress says over lunch at Barnaby's, a fashionable
Los Angeles restaurant. ``When one door closed, I went to another
door. And when that one closed, I went to another.''
 &HT;    Most of those closing doors belonged to movie studios, where she
was told again and again that the project didn't have enough
commercial potential. Only after three years of studio rejections
did Berry approach HBO.
 &HT;    ``Dorothy was a movie star, not a TV star,'' she says, ``and I
really wanted a movie to reflect her legacy.''
 &HT;    But with its reputation for producing feature-quality films for
television, HBO was interested in Dandridge's unquestionably
dramatic story, which includes her meteoric rise to success but
also two failed marriages, the birth of a mentally retarded
daughter, drug dependency, a devastating love affair with director
Otto Preminger and, finally, death by a drug overdose in 1965 at
only 42.
 &HT;    Berry hasn't had to face the kind of racism Dandridge battled
daily _ even at the height of her popularity as one of America's
most successful nightclub performers, she was not allowed to stay
in some hotels which booked her act. She often was denied access to
backstage restrooms, and was forced to use service entrances to
reach the stage.
 &HT;    But Berry believes that it was Dandridge and people like her who
made it possible for her to be what she is today _ a successful
actress, model and now producer.
 &HT;    ``Dorothy lived that I can be where I am,'' she says. ``She
passed the ball, and now I pass it. That's how evolution works.''
 &HT;    Making the movie is part of her effort to pass that ball, Berry
adds.
 &HT;    ``I really want to feel that I have made a contribution,'' she
says. ``One day after I am gone, I want someone sitting in an
interview to say, `Because Halle Berry lived, I was better able to
do this. Because of her, I am afforded this opportunity.'''
 &HT;    Berry has had her own encounters with racism, of course. Her
celebrity status as one of the world's most beautiful women shields
her from many slights and insults suffered by the less famous, but
she remembers many episodes in her youth.
 &HT;    ``Oh, I've had my share,'' she says, ``especially since my
mother was white.''
 &HT;    The actress' maternal grandparents stopped speaking to their
daughter after her marriage to a black man. Only after her parents
separated did her grandparents come back into the picture. Her
mother moved Halle and her older sister, still children, out of
Cleveland's inner city and into an all-white suburb.
 &HT;    ``It was the best thing for us, but it made it difficult because
I was so different from everybody else,'' Berry recalls. ``I got a
lot of `How can you be this when your mother's that?'
 &HT;    ``I know a lot of interracial kids who won't tell you they're
black,'' she continues. ``They'll say, `I'm ``other'' _ I'm mixed.
I'm just as white as I am black.'
 &HT;    ``And on one level that's true,'' Berry adds. ``But unless you
want to walk around with a sign on your head that says, `Hey, I'm
half-white,' nobody is going to treat you that way. They may not
treat you better anyway.
 &HT;    ``My mother taught me early on that it's how you are perceived
by the world, not what you really are.''
 &HT;    An honors student in junior high school, Berry was voted class
president, head cheerleader and editor of the school newspaper, but
when she was also elected prom queen the principal, Mr. Morrelli,
accused her of stuffing the ballot box _ a humiliating accusation
which still stings.
 &HT;    But Berry got sweet revenge by winning the Miss Teen Ohio
pageant, then the Miss Teen America pageant and then the Miss Ohio
pageant. In 1986 she was first runner-up in the Miss America
pageant.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to go to Mr. Morrelli and say, `Who stuffed the
ballot boxes this time?''' she admits. ``But I didn't. I felt the
point had been made.''
 &HT;    The pageant led to a modeling career, which in turn led to
acting. Her television debut was in ``Living Dolls,'' a
not-especially-inspired series about four models that was cancelled
after 13 episodes.
 &HT;    Nonetheless Berry was intrigued by acting, and the television
credit helped get her in to audition for Spike Lee's film ``Jungle
Fever'' (1991).
 &HT;    She'd been brought in to read for the part of a yuppie-ish,
middle-class wife, but she was more interested in the less
glamorous role of a strung-out drug addict.
 &HT;    ``I'd like to read for the role of the crackhead instead,'' she
told Lee.
 &HT;    The director agreed and, after a quick trip to the bathroom to
remove all her makeup, Berry did a reading that landed her the part
_ and transformed her career almost overnight.
 &HT;    ``It allowed me to shed all the beauty-modeling stuff,'' she
says, ``and show people I had been studying acting and could do
it.''
 &HT;    ``Losing Isaiah'' (1995), in which she co-starred with Jessica
Lange in a child-custody drama, earned her more respect, though the
film, like ``Jungle Fever,'' didn't do well commercially.
 &HT;    Since then, however, she's found few meaty roles _ which is, of
course, part of her motivation for developing her own projects.
Meantime, she continues to make high-profile Hollywood films: Her
next, to be filmed in Canada in the autumn, is ``The X-Men,'' an
action picture based on the popular comic-book series.
 &HT;    Her maiden voyage as a producer has whetted Berry's appetite for
more behind-the-scenes duties, but next time she thinks she'll look
for a project she won't be starring in.
 &HT;    ``I want to enjoy each role to the fullest, and when you are
doing both you really can't,'' she says. ``When I'm producing I'd
like to just be thinking about the money and stuff, and not have to
worry about character and emotion. Conversely, when I was Dorothy I
didn't want to break and think about Halle's stuff.
 &HT;    ``As a producer, though, when they come to you and say, `We
don't have any more money, what are we going to do?' ... well, I
had to stop being Dorothy and come back to 1999.''

KELLIE MARTIN'S UNPREDICTABLE ROAD TO `ER'

 (Includes a color slide of Kellie Martin with Juliana Margulies in
a scene from ``ER.'') 
 By ANDREW RYAN  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to be a fan of a hit television show _ at least if you
suddenly find yourself hired to join the cast of that show.
</P>
<P>
   Kellie Martin, for example, had been a longtime aficionado of
the top-rated series ``ER'' before being cast as bumbling but
precocious medical student Lucy Knight for the show's 1998/99
season.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't hard to convey Lucy's awkward nervousness, she admits,
because that's exactly what Martin herself was feeling when she
found herself standing next to actors she'd admired for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a definite parallel for me in there,'' Martin says,
``because Lucy was intimidated by a lot of things at the beginning,
and it's the same thing with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked onto the `ER' set that first day, and I felt I had
never acted a day in my life,'' she admits. ``I was intimidated by
the people I was working with, because I had watched `ER' for
years. I totally forgot I had been acting since I was 7.''
</P>
<P>
   Things eventually settled down for character and actress alike
in their rookie ``ER'' season. It helped that Martin's character
was kept hopping: Among other developments, Lucy received an
instant baptism in emergency-room medicine, battled a
prescription-drug addiction and even had a brief romantic interlude
with her medical mentor/nemesis, Dr. John Carter (Noah Wyle).
</P>
<P>
   ``Those scenes with Carter were the best, because they're such
opposites in many ways,'' she says. ``Carter drives her nuts,
because he tries to be so damn perfect _ and Lucy is a lot looser,
but she still puts a lot of pressure on herself. Toward the end of
the season Lucy had learned to stand up for herself more, and
that's good.''
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, though Martin only recently turned 24, she's still
been acting for longer than most of her ``ER'' co-stars. When she
was 7, her aunt _ who worked as a governess for actor/producer
Michael Landon _ showed Landon a picture of her niece. That led to
a guest role on Landon's series ``Father Murphy,'' which was
followed by offers to appear in commercials and other dramatic
series.
</P>
<P>
   A child star had been born.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acting was definitely an extracurricular activity for me,''
Martin says with a shrug. ``Some kids played soccer, some kids
played tennis, I worked on TV shows. It was just what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Her breakthrough came in 1989, when the 13-year-old was cast in
the earnest ABC dramatic series ``Life Goes On.'' As Rebecca
Thatcher, she earned an Emmy nomination as the loving sister to a
brother (Chris Burke) with Down Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unique because we did a lot of things that other shows
don't have the guts to do,'' Martin says. ``We had an HIV-positive
character, and I don't think anyone has ever dealt with Down
Syndrome the way we did. To this day, people come up to me and tell
me that one of their family has Down Syndrome. I think the show
really made a difference in people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   After four seasons of ``Life Goes On,'' Martin graduated to her
own series _ ``Christy,'' about a headstrong young woman who heads
off to teach in the rugged Tennessee foothills, circa 1912.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard-core,'' she recalls. ``I was living in Tennessee
in a town of 200 people and working 14 to 16 hours a day. I was in
every scene. I actually fell asleep once in the middle of a scene!
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time I had been away from my family,'' she
adds. ``And I had to wear a corset, which didn't help anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Christy'' faded after a half season, after which Martin became
a fixture on the television-movie circuit in the early 1990s. She
specialized in traumatized characters, playing the teen killer of a
cheerleader in the fact-based ``A Friend to Die For'' (1994), a
battered wife in ``If Someone Had Known'' (1995), a drug addict in
``Her Last Chance'' (1996) and a deaf woman with abusive parents in
``Breaking Through'' (1997).
</P>
<P>
   ``During the period when I made a lot of TV movies, they were
all about issues and true stories,'' she says. ``I thought all
those issues were really important. I don't want to do any TV
movies now, unless it's something really important.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Martin enrolled at Yale University in New Haven, Ct.,
and _ except for an occasional summer-vacation movie and a brief,
quickly canceled series, ``Crisis Center'' _ stopped acting
entirely. It wasn't an easy decision, she says, but it was the only
way she could survive at college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day at Yale was tough,'' she admits, ``whether it was
trying to make friends or learning how to study for a final.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember,'' she explains, ``the entire time I was in high
school, it was with a tutor on a set. I never went to a regular
school. Students at Yale already know how to study or how to write
an essay. I didn't have those basics, and I had to learn them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, she did what she had to do, and had made it to her
junior year when she got a telephone call from ``ER'' executive
producer John Wells. It was an offer she couldn't pass up, even
though it necessitated a temporary hiatus in her college education.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, she says, things happened so quickly that she's still
sorting out everything that went on.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he asked me to be on the show, all I knew was that my
character would be a medical student,'' the actress says. ``That
was a month before I started filming, so I had no idea what they
wanted to do with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin didn't rush out to spend time with real-life medics in
preparation for the role, as many actors do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' she says. ``I know enough med students that I can call
up and ask questions. I already knew what it was like to be a
student, and we have a doctor on set at all times, so they can
explain the details.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays Martin spends her time away from the set basking in
nuptial bliss. Earlier this summer she married her longtime beau,
Yale Law School graduate Keith Christian, in a storybook New
England wedding, with her ``Life Goes On'' co-star Patti LuPone
singing at the reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best part about being married is that I get to see my
husband every day,'' she says happily. ``Keith is taking the bar
exams this summer, and he already knows he's clerking for a judge
next year. He's Mr. Make Plans _ he would map out his whole life if
he could. But then he married me, so now he can't.''
</P>
<P>
   After nearly 20 years in show business, Martin says, she's
learned never to make long-range plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never have and I never will, because you can't count on
them,'' she says firmly. ``I signed a six-year contract with `ER,'
but the ball is always in their court. If they choose not to renew
my contract at any time, they are allowed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I hope that never happens,'' she says with a glint
of a fan's zeal, ``because I'm on the best show on television.''

 &HT;    May we live with interesting candidates
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The spectacle of TV schlockmeister Jerry
Springer running for the Ohio U.S. Senate seat could be more fun
than a stageful of transvestite biker-bar strippers in leather
begging their boyfriends' forgiveness for secret affairs with rodeo
clowns.
</P>
<P>
   And in the process, it would represent a milestone in the merger
of celebrity entertainment and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Springer is still noncommittal about the job. A former mayor of
Cincinnati, he has more experience in elected office than Ross
Perot, Jesse Ventura, Steve Forbes and Florida Gov. Jeb Bush
combined.
</P>
<P>
   Responsible opinion nevertheless is aghast. But responsible
opinion is like Margaret Dumont in Marx Brothers' movies. It exists
to be aghast. That's its role.
</P>
<P>
   Responsible opinion wants bread without circuses. It wants
high-fiber policy discussions. It wants sober-minded debate. It
wants to pay down the deficit, slow global warming, think in the
long-term and find bipartisan common ground. And I want to agree
with it. I really, really do.
</P>
<P>
   But I am also a newspaper columnist. And the reptilian part of
my brain that allows me to perform that function says only one
thing, over and over:
</P>
<P>
   Jer-REE, Jer-REE, Jer-REE ...
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate has precious few chantable names. Nearly half
the body _ 48 members out of 100 _ have one-syllable names. We are
run by Jims, Tims, Bobs and Johns. Especially Johns. Eight senators
are Johns or Jons, enough to form a serious voting block. Almost
enough to form a softball team. Of the names remaining, none is
chantable.
</P>
<P>
   Orr-IN, Orr-IN, Orr-IN ...
</P>
<P>
   See, it just doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   But a name you can chant is only a small advantage for a
candidate. The name needs to be attached to a person who can get
the crowd out of their folding chairs. That's where the current
political field falls short.
</P>
<P>
   This is not necessarily a bad thing. On one level, we should be
reassured by the number of bland and short-named candidates among
us. The old Chinese curse, ``may you live in interesting times''
has a corollary in politics _ may you live with interesting
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of entire slates of lively, colorful candidates
with lurid nicknames should keep us up at night. That would take a
national crisis. The return of '60s and worse.
</P>
<P>
   These are prosperous, easygoing times. A time for preventive
maintenance, not revolution. It takes a boring candidate to step up
to that job. The kind of candidate who promises to be a good
listener, a compassionate conservative, a practical idealist, a
regular guy for regular times. Someone who, like Warren G. Harding,
promises ``not nostrums but normalcy ... not surgery but
serenity.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, such a public mood would bode ill for Springer's
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Except there is another trend at work. The wall between show
business and the public's business _ always lightly mortared and
missing a few bricks _ has fallen altogether. Ronald Reagan took on
this wall before he could turn his attention to the Berlin Wall.
Ventura's surprise election last year proved that even the loud and
stagy, low-rent theatrics of professional wrestling translate well
from the squared circle to political circles.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura crashed through the wall like a character in a Warner
Brothers cartoon, leaving a candidate-shaped opening anyone else
might stroll through.
</P>
<P>
   Jes-EEE, Jes-EEE, Jes-EEE ...
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who can both run for governor and be marketed as an
action figure is formidable, indeed. By contrast, an Al Gore action
figure would be a contradiction in terms. (Its knees bend so it can
sit politely and stand up straight!)
</P>
<P>
   Al-LLL, Al-LLL, Al-LLL ... Just can't be done.
</P>
<P>
   In post-Ventura America, any celebrity candidacy appears a
reasonable option. Why should Springer be any different? It's not
as though a Senate that holds the likes of Jesse Helms would get
too much stranger. Would Springer really be much hammier than
Robert Byrd? Are the fights on Springer's show much more staged
than the matchups on C-SPAN?
</P>
<P>
   It is not a stretch to imagine him there. They could have used
him during the impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Jer-REE, Jer-REE, Jer-REE ...
</P>
<P>
   That's the sound of columnists chanting, and they don't have
everyone's best interests in mind.

 &HT;    Enjoying the Bahamas, onboard
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHUB CAY, Bahamas _ My shipmates can't believe it. Here we are
in the lap of paradise _ pink and white sand beaches and water so
clear that 30 feet down looks like the bottom of my bathtub, and I
don't want to get off the boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just swing your legs over the side and slip into the water.
I'll catch you,'' my friend offers. I shake my head and tell him if
I wanted to, I could dive in and swim, but that I'm just not in the
mood right now. He tells me diving would not be a good idea unless
I intend to make like a clam and bury myself in the sand. He points
to the water gently lapping at his kneecaps. I should be
embarrassed but I'm not. I'm too busy making a fool of myself.
</P>
<P>
   The sun is lowering in the afternoon sky as our little boat
rides at anchor on a pristine beach at an uninhabited island in the
Berry chain. It's Shangri-la, the Garden of Eden without apples;
it's a trip most folks would mortgage their kids for, and I won't
get out of the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Just the morning before, we had left the marina on Harbour
Island where we'd spent an idyllic week sipping rum and coke and
listening to the fish fry, and aimed the big boat toward an 11-mile
stretch of reef-strewn treachery known as The Devil's Backbone. We
were taking the shortcut to Spanish Wells to refuel before we set
out for Chub Cay, a little spit of land at the southern end of the
Berry Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Having already read the 1999 Yachtsman's Guide to the Bahamas, I
knew what we were getting into. ``The passage (Devil's Backbone)
must be attempted in good light, when the reefs are visible, and
under favorable weather conditions.'' It recommends hiring a local
pilot to take you through and warns that in northerly conditions it
is impassable.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, I remained fearless. My old friends have been
navigating these waters half their lives. I know Richard isn't
going to risk ripping open the bottom of his boat on a slightly
submerged coral head, and I know Jeanne, his wife and my best
friend, can't swim. Besides, it isn't drowning I fear, although I'd
rather not. What scares the hell out of me is having my feet touch
the bottom and the subsequent host of yukky critters that live
there.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday I was an intrepid mariner.
</P>
<P>
   Today is a different story. ``Don't you want to see the Blue
Hole?'' Jeanne asks, trying to coax me into the water. I shake my
head because I really don't. ``There's a path from the beach,'' she
assures me. ``Real wide and not long. You'll love it.'' I know I
won't but I want to be a good sport so they'll ask me back again. I
give in and swing a tennis-shoed foot over the side. Artfully, I
dodge a couple of killer starfish and make it to shore. Richard
goes first, then Jeanne. I insist on being next so my friend can
guard my flank (read that
</P>
<P>
   however you like).
</P>
<P>
   Let me tell you, I have seen wider paths than this one beaten to
brand new outhouses, and the jungle is closing in on me. ``Are we
there yet?'' I whine at every turn. Jeanne assures me it's just a
little further and Richard warns me not to step on the curly-tailed
lizards.
</P>
<P>
   A light year later, I emerge at the rim of a big hole only to
discover it's black, not blue. Jeanne leans over to check it out
and loses her sunglasses. In the meantime, an armada of crazed
mosquitoes has attacked in an attempt to bleed us dry before we can
get back to the beach. We escape, but each of us is a pint low.
</P>
<P>
   On the run back to the marina, I have managed to stay pretty
busy whimpering and scratching myself, but in an effort to make
like a tourist I point to a large island to starboard and ask
Richard if it has a name. ``Cockroach Cay,'' he answers. I ask why
it's called that. His only answer is a wicked grin.
</P>
<P>
   I just hope it's not on next year's itinerary.

 &HT;    Shareware, freeware simple to find
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If butcher shops worked the same way as shareware
software, then you'd be able to take a nice roast home and serve it
to your family. Then _ if everyone thought it made a pretty good
meal _ you'd pay for the roast.
</P>
<P>
   Shareware is software that you can download for free, use and,
if you decide to keep it, send in the money. There's also a
category of software called freeware that you also download for
free, but you never pay a penny.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any type of program, from games to word processors, from
spreadsheets to weird little special purpose programs, is
available. There's shareware for the Mac, PCs, Linux _ almost any
type of operating system or computer you can name is represented.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays most shareware is distributed over the Internet. It's a
perfect distribution system for software of this type, since the
whole idea is to keep the overhead low. Even if you decide to keep
and use a program, the fees are usually small, often in the $20 to
$25 range.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best sites for shareware is at a place called _
appropriately enough _ Shareware.Com (www.shareware.com). Just use
the pull-down menu on the start page to tell it the type of
computer system you are running. Even if you have an Atari or an
Amiga computer, you'll find a selection that's right for your
machine and software.
</P>
<P>
   Then you can use the search feature and a keyword or two to find
your software. Or perhaps you aren't looking for a specific program
but would like to see what's available in a category like games.
You'll find links that take you to shareware libraries organized
according to topic.
</P>
<P>
   Our next site is called Pass the Shareware, located at www
</P>
<P>
   .passtheshareware.com/. This place is really a search engine
that searches various download areas on the Web to help you find
the program you want. The selling point for Pass the Shareware is
that it supposedly searches only for the best available shareware
programs. A claim like that is difficult to evaluate without
thousands of uses.
</P>
<P>
   Another nice feature of this site is a special link that takes
you to sites for freeware. That way, if you want to avoid spending
any money at all, you can restrict your search to freeware.
</P>
<P>
   If _ like many computer users _ you spend most of your computer
time using the Internet, you really need to know about Tucows. When
it comes to freeware and shareware for the Internet, this site at
www.tucows.com/ is simply the best there is.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find Internet programs grouped according to category, and
each has a Tucows rating _ sort of a minireview _ that lets you
know how the gurus at this site view a program. Obviously, you'll
find common programs like Web browsers, FTP programs, newsgroup
readers and e-mail applications here.
</P>
<P>
   But since this site specializes in Internet stuff, it's very
deep. You'll find really esoteric Net software here, too: programs
that let you trace the route to a Web site, programs that time
response time on the Net and other stuff so specialized that you
practically need a degree in computer science to know how to use
it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, CNet's Download.Com is also a great place for general
purpose shareware services. You'll find it at www.download.com.

 &HT;    `Age of Empires' rules over fun
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You don't see many new war strategy games for the Mac.
That's why the release of Microsoft's Mac version of ``Age of
Empires'' is a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   This game was a huge hit among PC users. I suspect it will have
the same success on the Mac platform, for good reason. ``Age of
Empires'' is a beautifully rendered, live-action strategy game.
Players guide one of a dozen or so ancient civilizations through
12,000 years of development.
</P>
<P>
   The game is reasonably accurate in its depiction of the rise of
civilization. You get to choose from such ancient cultures as the
Chinese Shang, the Babylonians, the Japanese Yamato, the Persians
and the Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
   Each civilization has different strengths and weaknesses. For
example, the Babylonians excel at building impenetrable walled
cities, while the Yamatos are skilled horsemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Age of Empires'' is a cross between ``Warcraft'' and
``Civilization,'' among the two most popular games ever released.
Like ``Warcraft,'' ``Age of Empires'' is a war simulation. You
build and direct armies in real time.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Civilization,'' ``Age of Empires'' requires you to build
and maintain a healthy economy to support your armies. Expansion
and warfare are inextricably tied.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike ``Civilization,'' ``Age of Empires'' is at heart a
war game. No matter how peaceful your intentions, the other
computer-generated players will attack you.
</P>
<P>
   As a war game, ``Age of Empires'' is great fun. Imagine the toy
soldiers of your childhood coming to life before your eyes. That's
what ``Age of Empires'' is like.
</P>
<P>
   The game's animation and sound effects are great. Stones hurled
by catapults soar through the air with trails of smoke. Mortally
wounded cavalry reel, whinny and then collapse on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   While good, ``Age of Empires'' has some serious weaknesses. The
biggest is an inability to see and control all your pieces at once.
</P>
<P>
   There's no global panel that lists all your soldiers, villagers
and buildings. That gets to be a pain when you've got 50 different
pieces scattered across a big map.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that the game is not especially Mac-friendly.
It lacks some of the key commands and shortcuts Mac users take for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there's no way to just quit the game. You have to
work your way back through a series of screens. Nor is there a way
to turn off three long video clips that introduce the game every
time you start up. What a pain.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, though, ``Age of Empires'' is a wonderful addition to
the Mac pantheon of games. Those who loved ``Warcraft'' and
``Civilization'' will find it irresistible.

 &HT;    AOL's campus is a quiet happening
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like Alice in Wonderland, I had a chance to step
behind the America Online sign-on screen and see what life was like
at the company's headquarters in Dulles, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, AOL doesn't call it a headquarters. It's a campus.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear if AOL has extended its rivalry with Microsoft _
which also calls its headquarters a campus _ onto the real estate
front. But the AOL campus is big. There are two very large
buildings and two more being built.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you notice is how quiet it is. The only noises
are people typing and the infamous ``you've got mail'' and
instant-message chimes ringing out from the endless rows of
cubicles and offices.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every computer screen is cluttered with open mailboxes
and stacks of instant-message screens. One AOL executive said he
seldom answers his phone or checks his voice mail. Amenities for
staffers include a gym, concierge service (where there are people
who will dash out to pick up employees' kids or dry cleaning), a
cafeteria and a gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   The second thing you notice is the decor. It's steel, glass and
Italian modern (and oddly shaped) couches, chairs and computer
chairs. The cool computer workstations are oak with sharp black
accents.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to check your e-mail or surf the Web here, come
armed with an AOL account, because that's the only way you'll get
online. The computers the company makes available for visitors in
the lobby don't even have a stand-alone version of the Netscape
browser, although tour guides are careful to walk visitors past the
office of Netscape creator Marc Andressen _ now an AOL employee.
They deliberately point it out as if to say, ``Yeah, here's the guy
who developed the idea of the Web browser in the first place, but
he works for us now. So there.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL and its employees all seem to radiate a sense of confidence,
self-satisfaction, entitlement and inevitability that is
breathtaking. And why not? They work for the No. 1 online service
in the world, with 17 million subscribers and an estimated 20
million users.
</P>
<P>
   The company's closest competition _ if you can even call it
competition _ is from Internet service providers that average
anywhere from 1 million to 2 million subscribers. Atlanta-based
MindSpring would be in that pack.
</P>
<P>
   Sniffing at numbers like that, Matt Korn, AOL's network
operations senior vice president, estimates that about 2 million
people are online on AOL at any given time.
</P>
<P>
   Walking through the long hallways and winding rows of cubicles
and offices talking with the people who make AOL happen, it is
clear the company didn't reach the 17 million subscriber mark by
wishing and hoping.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the olden days of AOL, the company wowed computer users
by creating an online service that would let people talk to each
other in real time. This single concept, now known as chat, has
become a staple of any successful Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   AOL also pioneered the instant-messaging service. The fact that
Microsoft has developed a similar technology, a cornerstone of
AOL's service for years, has sent AOL into a frenzy for a variety
of reasons both monetary and personal. It's pretty simple to figure
out: AOL thought of it first, lots of people like it, now the
copycats come in.
</P>
<P>
   The senior vice president and general manager of AOL's
interactive services, Jonathan Sacks, says the service is all about
communication on a variety of levels that include not just instant
messaging but chat, e-mail and message boards as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of ways to think about what AOL is,'' he says.
``I think of what can we do to make people's lives easier. We used
to think people just wanted to surf the Web. Now we know they want
to see the benefits of being online. They want to know `How can I
communicate better?' `How can I make my life less complicated?'
`How can I help my kids do better in school?'''
</P>
<P>
   Sacks and most of the decision-makers at AOL know there are
thousands of things to do online.
</P>
<P>
   They also know AOL's killer application is connecting real
people to other real people in real time.
</P>
<P>
   As its members become more sophisticated, AOL has developed new
products to help people stay in touch, even while they're pumping
gas. Another product its getting ready to roll out is the AOL
calendar, which allows groups of friends or business associates to
keep up with changing plans for everything from a soccer match to a
business meeting.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody in Dulles can stop talking about ``You've Got
Pictures,'' a partnership with Kodak and 38,000 retailers across
the country to let members have their family photos sent to AOL to
be put online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers have to have a comfort level,'' Sacks says.
``AOL should be like coming home.''
</P>
<P>
   Bless their hearts, the folks at AOL can't imagine why anyone
would want to live anywhere else.

 &HT;    Net freedom issues shaded in gray
 &HT;    By Gerry Yandel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Few things are more fun in the infancy of this mass
communications renaissance than a little piece of free software
with big ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Zimmermann's standoff with the U.S. government a couple
years ago over PGP _ his uncrackable encryption program for e-mail,
which undersells itself as Pretty Good Privacy _ was a thrill to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow Zimmermann's software got uploaded to the Internet.
Uncle Sam, citing the threat of cyber-terrorism and other
techno-scenarios designed to scare people, wanted the software to
be classified, essentially restricting it from everyday use.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it was already widely distributed across the Net,
and eventually the Justice Department caved in, after threatening
Zimmermann with treason for several years. PGP remains, for the
most part, freely available, and Netizens are allowed to keep their
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Third Voice, which hit the Web at the end of May, is nowhere
near as sophisticated as PGP. But the waters it may stir, and the
basic rights it invokes, run just as deep.
</P>
<P>
   In a simplistic explanation, Third Voice allows any Web surfer
to paste a comment onto any Web page. Any other surfer whose
browser is armed with Third Voice can read the note, render an
addendum expounding on the theme or start a new thread entirely
with a posting of his own. To add a bit of sophistication, notes
can be public, private or personal.
</P>
<P>
   How it works is fairly simple, too. All of the notes _ along
with their positions on the Web page _ are stored on Third Voice
servers. When someone's browser requests a page, the software kicks
in, checking the URL against its database, and displays a copy of
the Web page's HTML code with little icons inserted where the notes
are. Clicking an icon opens the note _ which is stored on the Third
Voice servers _ using the same process. The original Web page code
isn't altered, so the icons are invisible to anyone not using Third
Voice.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the implications of such a program:
</P>
<P>
   People who get ripped off by a company online can warn other
Netizens with a posting right on the offender's home page.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of a particular band or movie could run a Third Voice
thread at the official Web site.
</P>
<P>
   An individual's log-in and password for a Web site can be posted
on a protected note to themselves at the log-in page.
</P>
<P>
   A schoolteacher could leave notes on Web sites she assigns her
class to visit for homework.
</P>
<P>
   Is that cool or what?
</P>
<P>
   Well, some people don't think so _ but that's the stuff that
helps make great philosophical issues fun. Even though Third Voice
is so beta it isn't yet available for Netscape _ coming soon, they
promise _ there's already an opposition party called Say No To
Third Voice, made up of some 400 concerned Web page designers and
developers.
</P>
<P>
   They warn that there are other uses of Third Voice that aren't
so cool:
</P>
<P>
   A vendor could post advertisements on a competitor's site,
offering to undercut prices.
</P>
<P>
   A pornographer could litter hundreds of pages with links to his
Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Obscene rantings could be posted on otherwise pedestrian Web
sites, bloating the Web with even more spam, vulgar spam at that.
</P>
<P>
   But wait a minute. The Net is supposed to be the new global mass
communications medium that gives the power back to the people. It's
the tool that will further the cause of free speech, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a slippery slope.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of other ways _ good and bad _ the program can
be put to use. The Net's teeming hordes will undoubtedly find
several more _ better and worse _ that aren't even apparent yet.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Third Voice has already spawned an imitator called
Utok. (The Netscape version of Utok is ready now.) Then there's a
program called Gooey that allows users to open chat windows with
each other while browsing the same site. There's one called Odigo
that does both _ chat windows and notes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most interesting comments I've seen on the issue came
from Jonathan Zittrain, director of the Berkman Center for Internet
&AMP; Society at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arguably, this is the way to draw a mustache on the site,'' he
told Wired magazine, alluding to copyright law that says,
basically, painting a mustache on someone's painting is not
protected under free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand,'' he said, ``if all you're doing is
painting a mustache on a transparency and you look through it, is
that a derivative work?''
</P>
<P>
   There is one point, though, I haven't seen raised about these
kinds of programs that could keep them from ever catching on at the
grass-roots level. In order to work properly, they have to keep
track of your Web surfing movements very closely. That info, as we
all know, is very valuable out on the market.
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons it might not catch on, too. If the
signal-to-noise ratio gets too high _ i.e. puerile comments and
advertising spam outweigh useful info _ then no one will use it.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, at this point, the issue is in the hands of the
people to be decided.
</P>
<P>
   Once the virtual cat is out of the virtual bag, there's no
turning back.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Phil Zimmermann.

 &HT;    Book recounts AOL's bumpy rise to top
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kara Swisher's best seller, ``AOL.Com,'' has been
released in paperback. The book tells the story of the turbulent
rise of America Online as it became the largest online service.
</P>
<P>
   For AOL, the road to success was rocky from the start. The book
tells the story of how the company kept changing business lines and
products _ until it finally hit on the idea of a mass-market online
service. Even then, the going was rough for most of the company's
history.
</P>
<P>
   The August issue of Yahoo Internet Life takes on the issue of
music on the Internet. You'll find interviews with such Net music
pioneers as the Beastie Boys and Sarah McLachlan. The magazine also
includes more-intellectual fare, such as stories about copyright
protection on the Net and the financial prospects of distribution
music online.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   IBM has released an updated version of its electronic coloring
book program, ``Crayola.'' The latest version is called ``Crayola
Magic 3D Coloring Book Favorite Places'' and includes 100 pages to
color in 3-D. The selection includes color-by-the-numbers pages and
those that involve connecting the dots. Available only for PCs with
Windows 95 or higher, ``Crayola'' retails for about $20.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel has released its latest Barbie computer CD, this one
featuring sports activities. Called ``Barbie Super Sports,'' it
features Barbie snowboarding and inline skating. She can compete
against others in either sport on five different tracks. When
Barbie wins, she gets to pick out new clothes from the sport shop
as a reward. ``Barbie Super Sports'' is available only for PCs with
Windows 95 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   It's summertime, and the trivia comes easy. Especially on the
Net. Here's a site that offers lots of fun but admittedly useless
info. The site is called _ you guessed it _ Useless Knowledge.com.
At Useless Knowledge.com, you can find out such things as the fact
that Lily and Herman Munster were the first TV couple to be shown
sleeping in the same bed. Another tidbit on the site is the fact
that France _ not Scotland _ invented the kilt. You get the
picture. Useless Knowledge.com can be found at www

 &HT;    A few precautions can keep your computer humming
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I liked home computers best when they were totally
useless beasts.
</P>
<P>
   After all, when my Altair computer _ one that I put together
from a kit and that used toggle switches instead of a keyboard _
acted up (and it did that with the frequency of a spoiled
12-year-old), nothing important was affected. About all I did with
that computer was play a game called ``Life'' that involved
watching tiny dots multiply and then disappear _ by flipping the
toggle switches in just the right combination _ on the screen of
the 13-inch GE TV that I used as a monitor.
</P>
<P>
   I saw how much things had changed this weekend when my home
computer screwed up for reasons that I still do not understand.
</P>
<P>
   In one fell swoop, I lost the ability to exchange e-mails with a
retired nun whom I know very well but have never met; I could no
longer work on the book that I'll never finish; and I was barred
from the only computer game that I play anymore _ an electronic
version of canasta.
</P>
<P>
   Probably you are in the same boat _ you'd miss your computer if
it became an expensive beige paperweight. All electronic devices
are born to die, but there are some really easy things you can do
to postpone that day. So, for today, let's take a look at how to
keep your computer healthy.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, let's get to know two small programs that come
with Windows _ Scan Disk and Defrag _ that provide preventive
maintenance for your hard disk.
</P>
<P>
   Once every week, run Scan Disk _ which finds and sometimes fixes
problems that are going wrong on the hard disk. Then run Defrag.
Think of it as a housekeeper for your hard disk. It finds fragments
of programs that become scattered all over the disk and puts them
back together again.
</P>
<P>
   Just running these two programs on a weekly basis can be a big
factor in keeping your computer healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The next step will make sure that it eats right.
</P>
<P>
   If you hooked a good voltage meter up to your household current,
you'd probably be surprised at how variable the voltage is.
</P>
<P>
   It dips and soars like the stock market on steroids. All those
surges and dips can do harm to a PC. They won't toast it like a
lightning strike; instead, they slowly damage the components. Get a
good voltage surge protector (avoid the $14 models that are little
more than fancy extension cords), or better yet, get an
uninterruptible power supply.
</P>
<P>
   This gadget, universally referred to as a UPS, both filters the
current before it gets to your computer and then _ when the power
goes out _ automatically switches to battery power so you can shut
down your computer normally. A UPS was once too pricey for all but
business users, but now you can get one for a little over $100. Do
it _ that's cheap insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I've told you some things that you should do, let's
talk about some stuff not to do.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't turn your PC on and off every time you use it. Leave it
on until you're done with it for the night. Turning the machine on
and off creates current surges that can age components.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't block ventilation holes in the PC or on the monitor.
(Some folks pile papers on top of the monitor. I once saw an
impressive monitor fire right here in the newsroom because of
that.) When it comes to the PC, keep it several inches away from
the sides of a desk or a wall _ or from anything that might block
its intake of air.
</P>
<P>
   _ Periodically open up the case of the PC and look for
accumulations of dust inside. While the case is open, firmly reseat
internal modem cards and any other accessory cards.
</P>
<P>
   The contacts on these cards expand and contract with heat and
cooling and can work themselves loose, creating intermittent
connections.

 &HT;    Intel microscope ready for school
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Intel has a handful of new products for the child or
young adult heading back to school.
</P>
<P>
   The QX3 computer microscope, which sells for about $100, is a
digital microscope that lets users magnify and display microscopic
images on their PC screen and then manipulate those images.
</P>
<P>
   The microscope and software, developed by Intel and Mattel, let
users create still and moving images as well as time-lapse movies.
The images can be printed in the form of posters and stickers. They
can also be used to make on-screen slides, video shows and image
files that can be sent as e-mail attachments.
</P>
<P>
   The microscope and software are expected to be in stores by
October.
</P>
<P>
   The Intel PC Camera Pack is a combination camera and videophone.
The software lets users make videophone calls over broadband and
dial-up Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   The device requires that the person with whom you are
communicating also have the same product, which makes it a kind of
PC walkie-talkie. But the camera pack comes with a free,
ready-to-mail CD with an extra copy of the videophone software.
</P>
<P>
   The camera pack, designed to make it interesting for college
students to phone home, will sell for about $80 once it reaches
stores in November.
</P>
<P>
   SITE AIDS IN DESIGNING WEDDING ANNOUNCEMENTS
</P>
<P>
   Web sites help people make plane reservations, buy cars, order
best sellers. Now the level of detail is getting a bit more
specific. An Orlando, Fla.-based Web site is putting the act of
designing and ordering wedding announcements on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.ourbeginning.com, was launched in March. It lets
you pick stationery by style, theme, presentation and color.
Another part lets you search by manufacturer and model number, in
case you saw a style in a store and wanted to compare prices.
</P>
<P>
   Other features include ``Ask Susan,'' a question-and-answer
wedding consulting and etiquette guide, and a personal preview,
which lets you create a page of your favorite choices that can be
viewed by others.
</P>
<P>
   OurBeginning.com delivers orders in seven business days.
</P>
<P>
   RESEARCHERS SPEED UP CHIPS BY STACKING THEM
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Purdue University have developed a way to make
computer chips smaller and faster. The idea is to stack the chips
in an unlimited number of layers.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional way of making chips shapes the silicon in
several steps. The new method, epitaxial growth, grows the silicon
into distinct ``islands'' that extend vertically, linking up with
the next layer. The resulting chip has several layers of
transistors with short connections, which makes for a faster,
denser circuit. Fast circuits make faster chips, which make faster
PCs.
</P>
<P>
   NET-SAVVY DO SOME HOUSE-HUNTING ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   If you're already Internet-savvy and in the market for real
estate, chances are you will use the Web during your search,
according to a new online study by NPD Online Research.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted in June, involved 2,355 people from NPD's
Web panel, a group recruited on the Web to participate in Web-based
surveys.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that 88 percent of those who have browsed the
Web for property said they looked for residential real estate
online.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-five percent looked for houses, 11 percent sought
condominiums and 2 percent were interested in co-ops. Among the
online house-hunters, 42 percent were looking for their first home.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the searches do not lead to actual meetings with
Realtors and actual purchases, however. Among those polled, 19
percent said they went to a Realtor, and 7 percent said they bought
property they saw on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Those polled said convenience was the main reason they
house-hunted on the Web. Fewer people, about 38 percent, said they
searched online because of the huge selection.
</P>
<P>
   Homes selling for less than $200,000 were the ones visited most
often by online house hunters. The study found that Realtor.com and
century21.com were the Web sites most often visited by the sample
group.
</P>
<P>
   NPD Online Research is a division of the NPD Group, a marketing
information company in Port Washington, N.Y.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: I have an odd-jobs man I pay about $50 a
week. Surely I need to do something regarding taxes and Social
Security, but what? Can you guide me?
</P>
<P>
   _ H.J. Hewitt
</P>
<P>
   A: Your odd-jobs man sounds like an independent contractor to
me. If he is, then he is responsible for his own taxes and Social
Security payments, not you. As an independent contractor this
odd-jobber is the same as the pest control man or a landscape
service. Kenneth Vargas of the IRS notes some of the signs that you
are paying an independent contractor: provides service for others
besides you; uses his own equipment (hammer, nails, etc.); and is
not required to work set, scheduled hours. Q: I recently handled a
real estate sale for an elderly gentleman whose Social Security
card was issued Jan. 27, 1937. Seems to me to be one of the first
groups of cards issued. Can you find out when the government first
issued cards and what the middle two numbers were at the beginning?
_ Don Sanders
</P>
<P>
   A: The newly formed Social Security Administration, having no
field offices, distributed blocks of cards via local post offices
throughout the country. No card should have been issued before Nov.
24, 1936. However, some cards have slightly earlier dates. The
lowest numbers were issued in blocks to New Hampshire. Grace D.
Owen of Concord was issued the first, 001-01-0001. Easy to
remember.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A friend is moving to Minnesota and needs to store a
refrigerator for a while. She is receiving all sorts of advice on
the best way to store it. Do you have any ideas? _ J.F.
</P>
<P>
   A: Clean the inside and outside of the appliance thoroughly with
vinegar or with baking soda and water. Dry well. Empty any
reservoirs such as the water dispenser or ice maker. Store the unit
in a dry area where the climate is controlled (this one might be
tough in Minnesota). The temperature should not dip below 50
degrees for extended periods of time. Leave the doors ajar. The
accumulated dust is a small price to pay for preventing the plastic
smell. Cover the unit with cloth, not plastic, to prevent moisture
buildup and rust. If you are an odor overachiever, place crew socks
filled with coffee grounds, charcoal or baking soda inside the
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My question is about ``The Mod Squad'' television show from
the '60s and '70s. In its first season, what kind of station wagon
did the three characters travel in? _ Robert G.
</P>
<P>
   A: Julie, Pete and Linc were tooling around Los Angeles in a
station wagon named Woody. On this much many agree. I found one
``Squad''-o-phile who insists the wagon was a two-door Mercury
station wagon, 1951 vintage.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recently deceased friend left everything in his will to his
sister and a friend. The named beneficiary of his retirement fund,
however, is someone else. On several occasions he specifically told
me and several other people that this retirement money should also
go to his sister and his friend. The retirement beneficiary plans
to claim the money. Doesn't the will supercede everything else? _
R.D.
</P>
<P>
   A: This is a common problem. A will does not change the named
beneficiaries of retirement funds and life insurance policies, says
Duncan Osborne, board certified attorney in estate planning and
probate law. When reviewing assets during the estate planning
process, clients have to be reminded repeatedly to change the
beneficiary names on these accounts, notes Osborne. All the
witnessed declarations in the world do not change the named
beneficiary's rights; however, you can always hope the friends and
family of the deceased will honor such wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Someone told me that the new quarters with the states on them
are more valuable or possibly will be in the future than regular
quarters. We have acquired a few recently and my husband wants to
spend them, but I won't let him. I told him you would be able to
settle this! _ J. Martin
</P>
<P>
   A: The coin market, like the stock market, can be fickle. For
example, Brian Owens of Village Coin Shop says a 1995 proof set of
coins when issued sold for $12.50 and today is worth $40. On the
other hand, the 1986 Statue of Liberty silver dollar proof was
issued at $30-$35 and now goes for a mere $8.50. Spend the quarters
you receive in change. Then begin the 10-year task (only five coins
issued each year) of collecting 200 commemorative quarters: the
Philadelphia and Denver uncirculated quarters as well as the proof
issue and 90 percent silver proof issue of each of the 50. Maybe
the collection gods will shine on you.

   Q: I have always written on the backs of our family photos with
a ball-point pen, but I recently read an article that advised
against it. Can you tell me what the concern is? I tried a 6B
pencil, but it doesn't write well on photo paper. Any other
suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   _ K. Witt
</P>
<P>
   A: Lose the pen and the pencil. They mark the photos and do not
last. You need film print marking pens that write on plastic and
film, do not smear, and are acid-free and nonwater soluble. All for
less than $2 a pen.
</P>

   _ Skillet aficionados have shared their secrets for cleaning
cast iron when culinary efforts go awry. Jim Washburn puts his
skillet in the oven during the self-cleaning cycle, reducing
burned-on glops to ash. (Make sure you use an old rack since this
cycle damages most oven racks.) Transplanted Louisianan Roxanne
Barrilleaux cleans crusted-on iron skillets by building a safe fire
outside or in the fireplace. When fire and coals are extremely hot,
toss in the pans. The fire bakes off the crusted grease, inside and
out. Reseason the pan.

 &HT;    Shareware, freeware simple to find
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If butcher shops worked the same way as shareware
software, then you'd be able to take a nice roast home and serve it
to your family. Then _ if everyone thought it made a pretty good
meal _ you'd pay for the roast.
</P>
<P>
   Shareware is software that you can download for free, use and,
if you decide to keep it, send in the money. There's also a
category of software called freeware that you also download for
free, but you never pay a penny.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any type of program, from games to word processors, from
spreadsheets to weird little special purpose programs, is
available. There's shareware for the Mac, PCs, Linux _ almost any
type of operating system or computer you can name is represented.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays most shareware is distributed over the Internet. It's a
perfect distribution system for software of this type, since the
whole idea is to keep the overhead low. Even if you decide to keep
and use a program, the fees are usually small, often in the $20 to
$25 range.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best sites for shareware is at a place called _
appropriately enough _ Shareware.Com (www.shareware.com). Just use
the pull-down menu on the start page to tell it the type of
computer system you are running. Even if you have an Atari or an
Amiga computer, you'll find a selection that's right for your
machine and software.
</P>
<P>
   Then you can use the search feature and a keyword or two to find
your software. Or perhaps you aren't looking for a specific program
but would like to see what's available in a category like games.
You'll find links that take you to shareware libraries organized
according to topic.
</P>
<P>
   Our next site is called Pass the Shareware, located at www
</P>
<P>
   .passtheshareware.com/. This place is really a search engine
that searches various download areas on the Web to help you find
the program you want. The selling point for Pass the Shareware is
that it supposedly searches only for the best available shareware
programs. A claim like that is difficult to evaluate without
thousands of uses.
</P>
<P>
   Another nice feature of this site is a special link that takes
you to sites for freeware. That way, if you want to avoid spending
any money at all, you can restrict your search to freeware.
</P>
<P>
   If _ like many computer users _ you spend most of your computer
time using the Internet, you really need to know about Tucows. When
it comes to freeware and shareware for the Internet, this site at
www.tucows.com/ is simply the best there is.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find Internet programs grouped according to category, and
each has a Tucows rating _ sort of a minireview _ that lets you
know how the gurus at this site view a program. Obviously, you'll
find common programs like Web browsers, FTP programs, newsgroup
readers and e-mail applications here.
</P>
<P>
   But since this site specializes in Internet stuff, it's very
deep. You'll find really esoteric Net software here, too: programs
that let you trace the route to a Web site, programs that time
response time on the Net and other stuff so specialized that you
practically need a degree in computer science to know how to use
it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, CNet's Download.Com is also a great place for general
purpose shareware services. You'll find it at www.download.com.

 &HT;    Summer filled with floods and droughts
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ People in Asia are struggling to recover from weeks of
summer flooding. At least 900 have been killed and millions left
homeless. In Southeast Asia, more monsoon rains are predicted,
which may cause more flooding, as residents begin to clean up.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in the United States, many farmers on the East Coast
are suffering a lack of rain. Maryland, facing its worst drought in
70 years, has shut down car washes, turned off fountains and banned
lawn watering. Delaware declared a drought emergency and imposed
restrictions on two-thirds of its residents. Officials in New
Jersey, New York and West Virginia also are cutting water use and
trying to assist farmers.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina is expected to declare a drought this week. Last
year's summer was so dry for South Carolina farmers that the state
was declared a federal disaster.
</P>
<P>
   HAVE DOG, WILL TRAVEL
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen-year-old William Dowell is back in England after a
kidney transplant and cancer treatments in France. And his dog,
Cassis, is home, too.
</P>
<P>
   Cassis traveled across the English Channel on the first of
Britain's new pet passports. The passport certified that Cassis is
rabies-free and made it unnecessary for the dog to stay in
quarantine for six months, as English law used to require.
</P>
<P>
   William wrote a letter to England's prime minister, Tony Blair,
asking that the 100-year-old law be changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I was worried I may never see Cassis again _ which
could go two ways because dogs die in quarantine, so it wasn't just
me,'' explained William.
</P>
<P>
   Each passport certifies that the pet has a tiny ID microchip
implanted, has been vaccinated against rabies and has been treated
for ticks and tapeworms.
</P>
<P>
   VIEW THE SOLAR ECLIPSE
</P>
<P>
   If you've always wanted to see a solar eclipse, but just haven't
been around long enough _ the last total solar eclipse in the
United States took place in 1979 _ here's your chance.
</P>
<P>
   Check out the Discovery Network this Wednesday for three hours
of live eclipse coverage. The cable channel's cameras will follow
the 70-mile-wide path where the sun is totally obscured by the
moon, from southern England, through France, Germany, Austria,
Hungary, Romania to the Middle East and its conclusion near India.
</P>
<P>
   Eclipse coverage runs from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m., with an hourlong
wrap-up that night at 10.

 &HT;    `Age of Empires' rules over fun
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You don't see many new war strategy games for the Mac.
That's why the release of Microsoft's Mac version of ``Age of
Empires'' is a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   This game was a huge hit among PC users. I suspect it will have
the same success on the Mac platform, for good reason. ``Age of
Empires'' is a beautifully rendered, live-action strategy game.
Players guide one of a dozen or so ancient civilizations through
12,000 years of development.
</P>
<P>
   The game is reasonably accurate in its depiction of the rise of
civilization. You get to choose from such ancient cultures as the
Chinese Shang, the Babylonians, the Japanese Yamato, the Persians
and the Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
   Each civilization has different strengths and weaknesses. For
example, the Babylonians excel at building impenetrable walled
cities, while the Yamatos are skilled horsemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Age of Empires'' is a cross between ``Warcraft'' and
``Civilization,'' among the two most popular games ever released.
Like ``Warcraft,'' ``Age of Empires'' is a war simulation. You
build and direct armies in real time.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Civilization,'' ``Age of Empires'' requires you to build
and maintain a healthy economy to support your armies. Expansion
and warfare are inextricably tied.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike ``Civilization,'' ``Age of Empires'' is at heart a
war game. No matter how peaceful your intentions, the other
computer-generated players will attack you.
</P>
<P>
   As a war game, ``Age of Empires'' is great fun. Imagine the toy
soldiers of your childhood coming to life before your eyes. That's
what ``Age of Empires'' is like.
</P>
<P>
   The game's animation and sound effects are great. Stones hurled
by catapults soar through the air with trails of smoke. Mortally
wounded cavalry reel, whinny and then collapse on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   While good, ``Age of Empires'' has some serious weaknesses. The
biggest is an inability to see and control all your pieces at once.
</P>
<P>
   There's no global panel that lists all your soldiers, villagers
and buildings. That gets to be a pain when you've got 50 different
pieces scattered across a big map.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that the game is not especially Mac-friendly.
It lacks some of the key commands and shortcuts Mac users take for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there's no way to just quit the game. You have to
work your way back through a series of screens. Nor is there a way
to turn off three long video clips that introduce the game every
time you start up. What a pain.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, though, ``Age of Empires'' is a wonderful addition to
the Mac pantheon of games. Those who loved ``Warcraft'' and
``Civilization'' will find it irresistible.

 &HT;    AOL's campus is a quiet happening
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like Alice in Wonderland, I had a chance to step
behind the America Online sign-on screen and see what life was like
at the company's headquarters in Dulles, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, AOL doesn't call it a headquarters. It's a campus.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear if AOL has extended its rivalry with Microsoft _
which also calls its headquarters a campus _ onto the real estate
front. But the AOL campus is big. There are two very large
buildings and two more being built.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you notice is how quiet it is. The only noises
are people typing and the infamous ``you've got mail'' and
instant-message chimes ringing out from the endless rows of
cubicles and offices.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every computer screen is cluttered with open mailboxes
and stacks of instant-message screens. One AOL executive said he
seldom answers his phone or checks his voice mail. Amenities for
staffers include a gym, concierge service (where there are people
who will dash out to pick up employees' kids or dry cleaning), a
cafeteria and a gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   The second thing you notice is the decor. It's steel, glass and
Italian modern (and oddly shaped) couches, chairs and computer
chairs. The cool computer workstations are oak with sharp black
accents.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to check your e-mail or surf the Web here, come
armed with an AOL account, because that's the only way you'll get
online. The computers the company makes available for visitors in
the lobby don't even have a stand-alone version of the Netscape
browser, although tour guides are careful to walk visitors past the
office of Netscape creator Marc Andressen _ now an AOL employee.
They deliberately point it out as if to say, ``Yeah, here's the guy
who developed the idea of the Web browser in the first place, but
he works for us now. So there.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL and its employees all seem to radiate a sense of confidence,
self-satisfaction, entitlement and inevitability that is
breathtaking. And why not? They work for the No. 1 online service
in the world, with 17 million subscribers and an estimated 20
million users.
</P>
<P>
   The company's closest competition _ if you can even call it
competition _ is from Internet service providers that average
anywhere from 1 million to 2 million subscribers. Atlanta-based
MindSpring would be in that pack.
</P>
<P>
   Sniffing at numbers like that, Matt Korn, AOL's network
operations senior vice president, estimates that about 2 million
people are online on AOL at any given time.
</P>
<P>
   Walking through the long hallways and winding rows of cubicles
and offices talking with the people who make AOL happen, it is
clear the company didn't reach the 17 million subscriber mark by
wishing and hoping.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the olden days of AOL, the company wowed computer users
by creating an online service that would let people talk to each
other in real time. This single concept, now known as chat, has
become a staple of any successful Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   AOL also pioneered the instant-messaging service. The fact that
Microsoft has developed a similar technology, a cornerstone of
AOL's service for years, has sent AOL into a frenzy for a variety
of reasons both monetary and personal. It's pretty simple to figure
out: AOL thought of it first, lots of people like it, now the
copycats come in.
</P>
<P>
   The senior vice president and general manager of AOL's
interactive services, Jonathan Sacks, says the service is all about
communication on a variety of levels that include not just instant
messaging but chat, e-mail and message boards as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of ways to think about what AOL is,'' he says.
``I think of what can we do to make people's lives easier. We used
to think people just wanted to surf the Web. Now we know they want
to see the benefits of being online. They want to know `How can I
communicate better?' `How can I make my life less complicated?'
`How can I help my kids do better in school?'''
</P>
<P>
   Sacks and most of the decision-makers at AOL know there are
thousands of things to do online.
</P>
<P>
   They also know AOL's killer application is connecting real
people to other real people in real time.
</P>
<P>
   As its members become more sophisticated, AOL has developed new
products to help people stay in touch, even while they're pumping
gas. Another product its getting ready to roll out is the AOL
calendar, which allows groups of friends or business associates to
keep up with changing plans for everything from a soccer match to a
business meeting.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody in Dulles can stop talking about ``You've Got
Pictures,'' a partnership with Kodak and 38,000 retailers across
the country to let members have their family photos sent to AOL to
be put online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers have to have a comfort level,'' Sacks says.
``AOL should be like coming home.''
</P>
<P>
   Bless their hearts, the folks at AOL can't imagine why anyone
would want to live anywhere else.

 &HT;    Good things happening for Braves' Brian Jordan
 &HT;    By Andy Staples
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Braves outfielder Brian Jordan finally is getting his
due.
</P>
<P>
   Last year as a St. Louis Cardinal, Jordan did not make the
All-Star team even though he had the highest batting average in the
National League at the All-Star break. This year, he made the team
when NL manager Bruce Bochy named him as a reserve.
</P>
<P>
   From 1989 to 1991, Jordan also played safety for the Atlanta
Falcons. But Jordan feared one bad move in football could cost him
his career. He decided in 1992 to play baseball only.
</P>
<P>
   The injury bug has caught him in baseball, though, and he has
had to miss recent games because of a pinched nerve in his neck and
a sore hand.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan does not like sitting and he promises he will come back
stronger than ever from his injuries.
</P>
<P>
   NFK caught a chat with Jordan:
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did it feel making the All-Star team this year after not
making it last year?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a new team and a new beginning, and I finally got
rewarded. Of course, I was upset last year about not making it. But
if you continue to work hard, good things happen.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did it feel to step on the field in Boston for the
All-Star Game?
</P>
<P>
   A: It felt great. The first day of practice with all the media,
it just felt like I was back in St. Louis with Mark McGwire. The
day of the game, when you saw all the great players _ the century's
best _ that's when it was like ``Wow, I'm on the All-Star team.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How frustrating are these recent injuries?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've tried to play through the pain. I'd see how I was
performing, and it was really bothering me more than I'd like. I
finally had to get it checked out. You hate missing games,
especially when you lose a player for the whole year. (Pitcher
Odalis Perez and catcher Javy Lopez will miss the rest of the
season because of injuries.)
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why did you decide to quit playing football?
</P>
<P>
   A: You last a lot longer in baseball. I can play this game a
long time.

 &HT;    Net freedom issues shaded in gray
 &HT;    By Gerry Yandel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Few things are more fun in the infancy of this mass
communications renaissance than a little piece of free software
with big ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Zimmermann's standoff with the U.S. government a couple
years ago over PGP _ his uncrackable encryption program for e-mail,
which undersells itself as Pretty Good Privacy _ was a thrill to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow Zimmermann's software got uploaded to the Internet.
Uncle Sam, citing the threat of cyber-terrorism and other
techno-scenarios designed to scare people, wanted the software to
be classified, essentially restricting it from everyday use.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it was already widely distributed across the Net,
and eventually the Justice Department caved in, after threatening
Zimmermann with treason for several years. PGP remains, for the
most part, freely available, and Netizens are allowed to keep their
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Third Voice, which hit the Web at the end of May, is nowhere
near as sophisticated as PGP. But the waters it may stir, and the
basic rights it invokes, run just as deep.
</P>
<P>
   In a simplistic explanation, Third Voice allows any Web surfer
to paste a comment onto any Web page. Any other surfer whose
browser is armed with Third Voice can read the note, render an
addendum expounding on the theme or start a new thread entirely
with a posting of his own. To add a bit of sophistication, notes
can be public, private or personal.
</P>
<P>
   How it works is fairly simple, too. All of the notes _ along
with their positions on the Web page _ are stored on Third Voice
servers. When someone's browser requests a page, the software kicks
in, checking the URL against its database, and displays a copy of
the Web page's HTML code with little icons inserted where the notes
are. Clicking an icon opens the note _ which is stored on the Third
Voice servers _ using the same process. The original Web page code
isn't altered, so the icons are invisible to anyone not using Third
Voice.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the implications of such a program:
</P>
<P>
   People who get ripped off by a company online can warn other
Netizens with a posting right on the offender's home page.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of a particular band or movie could run a Third Voice
thread at the official Web site.
</P>
<P>
   An individual's log-in and password for a Web site can be posted
on a protected note to themselves at the log-in page.
</P>
<P>
   A schoolteacher could leave notes on Web sites she assigns her
class to visit for homework.
</P>
<P>
   Is that cool or what?
</P>
<P>
   Well, some people don't think so _ but that's the stuff that
helps make great philosophical issues fun. Even though Third Voice
is so beta it isn't yet available for Netscape _ coming soon, they
promise _ there's already an opposition party called Say No To
Third Voice, made up of some 400 concerned Web page designers and
developers.
</P>
<P>
   They warn that there are other uses of Third Voice that aren't
so cool:
</P>
<P>
   A vendor could post advertisements on a competitor's site,
offering to undercut prices.
</P>
<P>
   A pornographer could litter hundreds of pages with links to his
Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Obscene rantings could be posted on otherwise pedestrian Web
sites, bloating the Web with even more spam, vulgar spam at that.
</P>
<P>
   But wait a minute. The Net is supposed to be the new global mass
communications medium that gives the power back to the people. It's
the tool that will further the cause of free speech, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a slippery slope.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of other ways _ good and bad _ the program can
be put to use. The Net's teeming hordes will undoubtedly find
several more _ better and worse _ that aren't even apparent yet.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Third Voice has already spawned an imitator called
Utok. (The Netscape version of Utok is ready now.) Then there's a
program called Gooey that allows users to open chat windows with
each other while browsing the same site. There's one called Odigo
that does both _ chat windows and notes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most interesting comments I've seen on the issue came
from Jonathan Zittrain, director of the Berkman Center for Internet
&AMP; Society at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arguably, this is the way to draw a mustache on the site,'' he
told Wired magazine, alluding to copyright law that says,
basically, painting a mustache on someone's painting is not
protected under free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand,'' he said, ``if all you're doing is
painting a mustache on a transparency and you look through it, is
that a derivative work?''
</P>
<P>
   There is one point, though, I haven't seen raised about these
kinds of programs that could keep them from ever catching on at the
grass-roots level. In order to work properly, they have to keep
track of your Web surfing movements very closely. That info, as we
all know, is very valuable out on the market.
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons it might not catch on, too. If the
signal-to-noise ratio gets too high _ i.e. puerile comments and
advertising spam outweigh useful info _ then no one will use it.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, at this point, the issue is in the hands of the
people to be decided.
</P>
<P>
   Once the virtual cat is out of the virtual bag, there's no
turning back.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Phil Zimmermann.

 &HT;    Book recounts AOL's bumpy rise to top
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kara Swisher's best seller, ``AOL.Com,'' has been
released in paperback. The book tells the story of the turbulent
rise of America Online as it became the largest online service.
</P>
<P>
   For AOL, the road to success was rocky from the start. The book
tells the story of how the company kept changing business lines and
products _ until it finally hit on the idea of a mass-market online
service. Even then, the going was rough for most of the company's
history.
</P>
<P>
   The August issue of Yahoo Internet Life takes on the issue of
music on the Internet. You'll find interviews with such Net music
pioneers as the Beastie Boys and Sarah McLachlan. The magazine also
includes more-intellectual fare, such as stories about copyright
protection on the Net and the financial prospects of distribution
music online.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM

<P>
   IBM has released an updated version of its electronic coloring
book program, ``Crayola.'' The latest version is called ``Crayola
Magic 3D Coloring Book Favorite Places'' and includes 100 pages to
color in 3-D. The selection includes color-by-the-numbers pages and
those that involve connecting the dots. Available only for PCs with
Windows 95 or higher, ``Crayola'' retails for about $20.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel has released its latest Barbie computer CD, this one
featuring sports activities. Called ``Barbie Super Sports,'' it
features Barbie snowboarding and inline skating. She can compete
against others in either sport on five different tracks. When
Barbie wins, she gets to pick out new clothes from the sport shop
as a reward. ``Barbie Super Sports'' is available only for PCs with
Windows 95 or higher.

   It's summertime, and the trivia comes easy. Especially on the
Net. Here's a site that offers lots of fun but admittedly useless
info. The site is called _ you guessed it _ Useless Knowledge.com.
At Useless Knowledge.com, you can find out such things as the fact
that Lily and Herman Munster were the first TV couple to be shown
sleeping in the same bed. Another tidbit on the site is the fact
that France _ not Scotland _ invented the kilt. You get the
picture. Useless Knowledge.com can be found at www

 &HT;    A few precautions can keep your computer humming
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I liked home computers best when they were totally
useless beasts.
</P>
<P>
   After all, when my Altair computer _ one that I put together
from a kit and that used toggle switches instead of a keyboard _
acted up (and it did that with the frequency of a spoiled
12-year-old), nothing important was affected. About all I did with
that computer was play a game called ``Life'' that involved
watching tiny dots multiply and then disappear _ by flipping the
toggle switches in just the right combination _ on the screen of
the 13-inch GE TV that I used as a monitor.
</P>
<P>
   I saw how much things had changed this weekend when my home
computer screwed up for reasons that I still do not understand.
</P>
<P>
   In one fell swoop, I lost the ability to exchange e-mails with a
retired nun whom I know very well but have never met; I could no
longer work on the book that I'll never finish; and I was barred
from the only computer game that I play anymore _ an electronic
version of canasta.
</P>
<P>
   Probably you are in the same boat _ you'd miss your computer if
it became an expensive beige paperweight. All electronic devices
are born to die, but there are some really easy things you can do
to postpone that day. So, for today, let's take a look at how to
keep your computer healthy.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, let's get to know two small programs that come
with Windows _ Scan Disk and Defrag _ that provide preventive
maintenance for your hard disk.
</P>
<P>
   Once every week, run Scan Disk _ which finds and sometimes fixes
problems that are going wrong on the hard disk. Then run Defrag.
Think of it as a housekeeper for your hard disk. It finds fragments
of programs that become scattered all over the disk and puts them
back together again.
</P>
<P>
   Just running these two programs on a weekly basis can be a big
factor in keeping your computer healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The next step will make sure that it eats right.
</P>
<P>
   If you hooked a good voltage meter up to your household current,
you'd probably be surprised at how variable the voltage is.
</P>
<P>
   It dips and soars like the stock market on steroids. All those
surges and dips can do harm to a PC. They won't toast it like a
lightning strike; instead, they slowly damage the components. Get a
good voltage surge protector (avoid the $14 models that are little
more than fancy extension cords), or better yet, get an
uninterruptible power supply.
</P>
<P>
   This gadget, universally referred to as a UPS, both filters the
current before it gets to your computer and then _ when the power
goes out _ automatically switches to battery power so you can shut
down your computer normally. A UPS was once too pricey for all but
business users, but now you can get one for a little over $100. Do
it _ that's cheap insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I've told you some things that you should do, let's
talk about some stuff not to do.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't turn your PC on and off every time you use it. Leave it
on until you're done with it for the night. Turning the machine on
and off creates current surges that can age components.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't block ventilation holes in the PC or on the monitor.
(Some folks pile papers on top of the monitor. I once saw an
impressive monitor fire right here in the newsroom because of
that.) When it comes to the PC, keep it several inches away from
the sides of a desk or a wall _ or from anything that might block
its intake of air.
</P>
<P>
   _ Periodically open up the case of the PC and look for
accumulations of dust inside. While the case is open, firmly reseat
internal modem cards and any other accessory cards.
</P>
<P>
   The contacts on these cards expand and contract with heat and
cooling and can work themselves loose, creating intermittent
connections.

 &HT;    Intel microscope ready for school
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Intel has a handful of new products for the child or
young adult heading back to school.
</P>
<P>
   The QX3 computer microscope, which sells for about $100, is a
digital microscope that lets users magnify and display microscopic
images on their PC screen and then manipulate those images.
</P>
<P>
   The microscope and software, developed by Intel and Mattel, let
users create still and moving images as well as time-lapse movies.
The images can be printed in the form of posters and stickers. They
can also be used to make on-screen slides, video shows and image
files that can be sent as e-mail attachments.
</P>
<P>
   The microscope and software are expected to be in stores by
October.
</P>
<P>
   The Intel PC Camera Pack is a combination camera and videophone.
The software lets users make videophone calls over broadband and
dial-up Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   The device requires that the person with whom you are
communicating also have the same product, which makes it a kind of
PC walkie-talkie. But the camera pack comes with a free,
ready-to-mail CD with an extra copy of the videophone software.
</P>
<P>
   The camera pack, designed to make it interesting for college
students to phone home, will sell for about $80 once it reaches
stores in November.
</P>
<P>
   SITE AIDS IN DESIGNING WEDDING ANNOUNCEMENTS
</P>
<P>
   Web sites help people make plane reservations, buy cars, order
best sellers. Now the level of detail is getting a bit more
specific. An Orlando, Fla.-based Web site is putting the act of
designing and ordering wedding announcements on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.ourbeginning.com, was launched in March. It lets
you pick stationery by style, theme, presentation and color.
Another part lets you search by manufacturer and model number, in
case you saw a style in a store and wanted to compare prices.
</P>
<P>
   Other features include ``Ask Susan,'' a question-and-answer
wedding consulting and etiquette guide, and a personal preview,
which lets you create a page of your favorite choices that can be
viewed by others.
</P>
<P>
   OurBeginning.com delivers orders in seven business days.
</P>
<P>
   RESEARCHERS SPEED UP CHIPS BY STACKING THEM
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Purdue University have developed a way to make
computer chips smaller and faster. The idea is to stack the chips
in an unlimited number of layers.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional way of making chips shapes the silicon in
several steps. The new method, epitaxial growth, grows the silicon
into distinct ``islands'' that extend vertically, linking up with
the next layer. The resulting chip has several layers of
transistors with short connections, which makes for a faster,
denser circuit. Fast circuits make faster chips, which make faster
PCs.
</P>
<P>
   NET-SAVVY DO SOME HOUSE-HUNTING ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   If you're already Internet-savvy and in the market for real
estate, chances are you will use the Web during your search,
according to a new online study by NPD Online Research.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted in June, involved 2,355 people from NPD's
Web panel, a group recruited on the Web to participate in Web-based
surveys.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that 88 percent of those who have browsed the
Web for property said they looked for residential real estate
online.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-five percent looked for houses, 11 percent sought
condominiums and 2 percent were interested in co-ops. Among the
online house-hunters, 42 percent were looking for their first home.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the searches do not lead to actual meetings with
Realtors and actual purchases, however. Among those polled, 19
percent said they went to a Realtor, and 7 percent said they bought
property they saw on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Those polled said convenience was the main reason they
house-hunted on the Web. Fewer people, about 38 percent, said they
searched online because of the huge selection.
</P>
<P>
   Homes selling for less than $200,000 were the ones visited most
often by online house hunters. The study found that Realtor.com and
century21.com were the Web sites most often visited by the sample
group.
</P>
<P>
   NPD Online Research is a division of the NPD Group, a marketing
information company in Port Washington, N.Y.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: I have an odd-jobs man I pay about $50 a
week. Surely I need to do something regarding taxes and Social
Security, but what? Can you guide me?
</P>
<P>
   _ H.J. Hewitt
</P>
<P>
   A: Your odd-jobs man sounds like an independent contractor to
me. If he is, then he is responsible for his own taxes and Social
Security payments, not you. As an independent contractor this
odd-jobber is the same as the pest control man or a landscape
service. Kenneth Vargas of the IRS notes some of the signs that you
are paying an independent contractor: provides service for others
besides you; uses his own equipment (hammer, nails, etc.); and is
not required to work set, scheduled hours. Q: I recently handled a
real estate sale for an elderly gentleman whose Social Security
card was issued Jan. 27, 1937. Seems to me to be one of the first
groups of cards issued. Can you find out when the government first
issued cards and what the middle two numbers were at the beginning?
_ Don Sanders
</P>
<P>
   A: The newly formed Social Security Administration, having no
field offices, distributed blocks of cards via local post offices
throughout the country. No card should have been issued before Nov.
24, 1936. However, some cards have slightly earlier dates. The
lowest numbers were issued in blocks to New Hampshire. Grace D.
Owen of Concord was issued the first, 001-01-0001. Easy to
remember.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A friend is moving to Minnesota and needs to store a
refrigerator for a while. She is receiving all sorts of advice on
the best way to store it. Do you have any ideas? _ J.F.
</P>
<P>
   A: Clean the inside and outside of the appliance thoroughly with
vinegar or with baking soda and water. Dry well. Empty any
reservoirs such as the water dispenser or ice maker. Store the unit
in a dry area where the climate is controlled (this one might be
tough in Minnesota). The temperature should not dip below 50
degrees for extended periods of time. Leave the doors ajar. The
accumulated dust is a small price to pay for preventing the plastic
smell. Cover the unit with cloth, not plastic, to prevent moisture
buildup and rust. If you are an odor overachiever, place crew socks
filled with coffee grounds, charcoal or baking soda inside the
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My question is about ``The Mod Squad'' television show from
the '60s and '70s. In its first season, what kind of station wagon
did the three characters travel in? _ Robert G.
</P>
<P>
   A: Julie, Pete and Linc were tooling around Los Angeles in a
station wagon named Woody. On this much many agree. I found one
``Squad''-o-phile who insists the wagon was a two-door Mercury
station wagon, 1951 vintage.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recently deceased friend left everything in his will to his
sister and a friend. The named beneficiary of his retirement fund,
however, is someone else. On several occasions he specifically told
me and several other people that this retirement money should also
go to his sister and his friend. The retirement beneficiary plans
to claim the money. Doesn't the will supercede everything else? _
R.D.
</P>
<P>
   A: This is a common problem. A will does not change the named
beneficiaries of retirement funds and life insurance policies, says
Duncan Osborne, board certified attorney in estate planning and
probate law. When reviewing assets during the estate planning
process, clients have to be reminded repeatedly to change the
beneficiary names on these accounts, notes Osborne. All the
witnessed declarations in the world do not change the named
beneficiary's rights; however, you can always hope the friends and
family of the deceased will honor such wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Someone told me that the new quarters with the states on them
are more valuable or possibly will be in the future than regular
quarters. We have acquired a few recently and my husband wants to
spend them, but I won't let him. I told him you would be able to
settle this! _ J. Martin
</P>
<P>
   A: The coin market, like the stock market, can be fickle. For
example, Brian Owens of Village Coin Shop says a 1995 proof set of
coins when issued sold for $12.50 and today is worth $40. On the
other hand, the 1986 Statue of Liberty silver dollar proof was
issued at $30-$35 and now goes for a mere $8.50. Spend the quarters
you receive in change. Then begin the 10-year task (only five coins
issued each year) of collecting 200 commemorative quarters: the
Philadelphia and Denver uncirculated quarters as well as the proof
issue and 90 percent silver proof issue of each of the 50. Maybe
the collection gods will shine on you.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have always written on the backs of our family photos with
a ball-point pen, but I recently read an article that advised
against it. Can you tell me what the concern is? I tried a 6B
pencil, but it doesn't write well on photo paper. Any other
suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   _ K. Witt
</P>
<P>
   A: Lose the pen and the pencil. They mark the photos and do not
last. You need film print marking pens that write on plastic and
film, do not smear, and are acid-free and nonwater soluble. All for
less than $2 a pen.
</P>
<P>
   Upshot/Update/Uproar:
</P>
<P>
   _ Skillet aficionados have shared their secrets for cleaning
cast iron when culinary efforts go awry. Jim Washburn puts his
skillet in the oven during the self-cleaning cycle, reducing
burned-on glops to ash. (Make sure you use an old rack since this
cycle damages most oven racks.) Transplanted Louisianan Roxanne
Barrilleaux cleans crusted-on iron skillets by building a safe fire
outside or in the fireplace. When fire and coals are extremely hot,
toss in the pans. The fire bakes off the crusted grease, inside and
out. Reseason the pan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Unsolicited faxes clogging your machine? Faxes generally
specify the fax number of the sender. Let the sender know you do
not want to receive these missives and that violations of your
request could result in a payment to you ($500 in damages).
EcoFuture recommends you fax a complaint letter to the advertiser
in 72-point font (1-inch height), which produces, when faxed, for a
typical two-paragraph letter, about 17 or 18 pages of text easily
read from across the room.

<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MCGOUGH &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In the early evening of Oct. 16, 1978, the newly elected Pope
John Paul II appeared on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica and
told the crowd that he had accepted election even though ``I was
afraid in receiving the nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, it was the first and last time that the former Cardinal
Karol Wojtyla of Krakow had known fear.
</P>
<P>
   Six days later, when he was invested as pope, John Paul II was
commending the Christianity of courage. Echoing the assurances of
the angel who told Mary of Nazareth that she would conceive and
bring forth the son of God, the 58-year-old pope told the throng in
St. Peter's Square: ``Be not afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II is not afraid--of religion's cultured despisers, of
geopoliticians who find his near-pacifism naive, of liberal
Catholics who accuse him of betraying the spirit of the Second
Vatican Council (''Vatican II''), of feminists who suspect that he
sees only two acceptable roles for women--virgin and mother.
</P>
<P>
   He is unafraid of his own infirmity, caused by advancing age and
by the residual effects of a 1981 assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, and perhaps most interesting, John Paul II has
intimated that he might be unafraid even of a downsizing of the
papal authority his charisma has done so much to dramatize.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1920 to the wife of a Polish soldier, the future pope
was a precocious intellectual, actor and poet who worked in a
quarry and a chemical plant during World War II. Imbued with the
popular Catholicism of Poland--marked by effusive devotion to the
Virgin Mary (an aspect of John Paul II's spirituality that
discomfits Protestants and liberal Catholics)-- Wojtyla began
studies for the priesthood in 1942 in an ``underground'' seminary
made necessary by the Nazi occupation.
</P>
<P>
   After the war he studied in Rome, boarding an ecclesiastical
fast track: auxiliary bishop of Krakow in 1958; archbishop in 1964;
and cardinal in 1967. Though Communist officials regarded him as
more pliable than other churchmen, he proved unafraid to confront
them in the cause of freedom for the Polish church.
</P>
<P>
   When Wojtyla was elected pope, after the 33-day reign of the
Italian John Paul I, the international press portrayed him as the
darkest of dark horses. In hindsight, his ecclesiastical networking
during and after Vatican II made him a logical candidate once it
was clear no Italian cardinal could win election.
</P>
<P>
   The rest is history, from which liberal and conservative
Catholics draw strikingly contrary conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The pope took the Gospel and his magnetic personality on the
road--forsaking the throne, on which past popes were carried
through St. Peter's Basilica, for the Popemobile.
</P>
<P>
   The year after his election, John Paul II returned to Poland for
nine days and encountered a rhapsodic reception that more than one
biographer credits with helping to sow the seeds of the Solidarity
movement's later challenge to the Communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on his world tour, which has passed through 119
countries, he kept faith with his predecessors John XXIII and Paul
VI in defending the dignity of workers and anathematizing the arms
race. He called for negotiations rather than the use of force in
the Gulf War and in Bosnia and Kosovo. He has been critical of
international sanctions against Iraq, and he hopes next year to
visit the birthplace of the biblical patriarch Abraham there.
</P>
<P>
   These and similar initiatives pleased political liberals inside
and outside the church; not so the Vatican's use of its
quasigovernmental status to oppose population-control initiatives
that the pope feared would contribute to the ``culture of death.''
</P>
<P>
   The style of John Paul II's papacy has occasioned as much
comment as its substance. Past popes were remote and magisterial
figures, but capitalizing on his relative youth, his actor's
panache, and a mastery of mass communications, John Paul II changed
all that--unafraid of diluting the papal mystique through
overexposure.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's roadshow has never had an exclusively Catholic cast.
He has met with Rome's chief rabbi and has joined in worship with
Lutheran bishops and, in a historic 1982 ceremony in Canterbury
Cathedral, with the spiritual leader of the Church of England,
which broke with Rome in the 16th century.
</P>
<P>
   Some would dismiss this as photo-op ecumenism and note that
Anglicans are not invited to take Holy Communion in Roman Catholic
churches, despite agreements by an Anglican-Roman Catholic
theological commission on the meaning of that sacrament. Anglicans
were also dismayed when Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the pope's
doctrinal watchdog, signed a document that seemed to rehabilitate a
much-criticized 1896 papal bull declaring the holy orders of
Anglican clergy ``absolutely null and utterly void.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't only in his policy toward other churches that John Paul
II is accused of preaching reform and practicing reaction. Vatican
II gave rise to a less hierarchical and more outward-looking
Catholicism and set the stage for once-unthinkable innovations like
plainclothes nuns and the celebration of the Mass in English and
other modern languages.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Catholics concede that John Paul II may follow the
letter of the council's decrees but, mindful that ``the letter
killeth, but the spirit giveth life'' (2 Corinthians 3:6), they see
in Vatican II a trajectory of further change that this pope has
frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II is not oblivious to these criticisms, just
contemptuous of them. It is his duty, he writes in ``Crossing the
Threshold of Hope,'' to ``interpret [Vatican II] correctly and
defend it from tendentious interpretations.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems the pope enjoys confounding his critics. He recalls
that on one trip to Poland he offended local adherents of the
``enlightened agenda'' by emphasizing the Ten Commandments. ``For
such people,'' he said, ``the pope becomes persona non grata when
he tries to convince the world of human sin.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the liberal Catholic case against the pope deals with
sexuality. It is even said that he has a ``woman problem,'' which
supposedly finds expression in his defense of church positions on
an all-male clergy, contraception, and abortion. Yes, abortion is
anathema to John Paul II, who is bemused by suggestions that he has
an ``obsession'' with the subject, but he condemns abortion because
he sees it as not only anti-life but also anti-woman.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has endorsed sexual equality in the workplace and in
society, but there is no doubt that he subscribes to a Christian
version of difference feminism. In a 1988 apostolic letter on the
``dignity and vocation of women,'' the pope warned that ``in the
name of liberation from male domination, women must not appropriate
to themselves male characteristics contrary to their own feminine
'originality.' ``
</P>
<P>
   What is so ``original'' about women? In a 1962 retreat for
university students in Krakow, the future pope, espousing what
sounds like the Gospel According to Carol Gilligan, told female
participants that ``women are more feeling and intuitive people and
become involved in things in a more sensitive and complete
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   In separate remarks to male students, Wojtyla argued that ``in
men, the intellect has a certain supremacy over the heart, and this
is why Christ entrusted responsibility for the Gospel as idea to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   This view of sexual differences suggests that for John Paul II,
opposition to women priests is not simply a tradition inherited
from his predecessors or even an emulation of Jesus' decision to
call only men as apostles. For John Paul II, as for Paul VI, the
male monopoly on priesthood is required by ``theological
anthropology.'' The pope has ratcheted up its importance by
decreeing that the male monopoly on priesthood is an article of
faith that must be ``definitively held by all the Church's
faithful.''
</P>
<P>
   His obstinacy on the issue is cited as proof that John Paul II
is indifferent to one of the major themes of Vatican II: Christian
reunion. The picture is more complicated. While the pope has warned
the archbishop of Canterbury that the ordination of women as
Anglican priests poses ``an increasingly serious obstacle'' to
reconciliation between Rome and Canterbury, he has indicated a
surprising willingness to compromise on a seemingly more
fundamental obstacle to reunion: the papacy itself.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1995 encyclical, John Paul II broached the possibility
that, in the interests of Christian unity, he or his successors
might ``find a way of exercising the [papal] primacy which, while
in no way renouncing what is essential to its mission, is
nonetheless open to a new situation.'' He went on to note that in
the first 1,000 years of Christianity the bishop of Rome ``acted by
common consent as moderator'' when Christians disagreed about
belief or discipline.
</P>
<P>
   This tantalizing suggestion of a scaled-down papal office was
seized on by the Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission
this May in a report that suggested Anglicans should accept a
circumscribed papal primacy as a ``gift to be shared.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope's suggestion also dovetails with a new interest among
some Protestant theologians in a ``universal primate'' who would
serve as a focus of unity for world Christianity. (What it does not
comport with, ironically, is the papal role as John Paul II has so
effectively enlarged it. Would a ``tiebreaker'' bishop of Rome have
any use for an airplane or a Popemobile?)
</P>
<P>
   Here is perhaps the ultimate example of John Paul II's
fearlessness: a willingness at least to consider some diminution in
the scope of his office in exchange for an improvement on the
current ``imperfect unity'' of Christendom.
</P>
<P>
   But churches that ordain female clergy might have their own
``woman problem'' in accepting a scaled-back papacy that came with
theological strings attached. The pope surely knows this, which
suggests that his target might not be the churches of the
Reformation, but the Orthodox and other ancient churches of the
East.
</P>
<P>
   Although estranged from Rome for hundreds of years, these
tradition-rich churches long have fascinated John Paul II, who
comes from a part of the world where Latin and Byzantine
Christianity overlap. And one more thing: The Eastern churches do
not, and likely never will, ordain women.

</P>
<P>
   In the early evening of Oct. 16, 1978, the newly elected Pope
John Paul II appeared on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica and
told the crowd that he had accepted election even though ``I was
afraid in receiving the nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, it was the first and last time that the former Cardinal
Karol Wojtyla of Krakow had known fear.
</P>
<P>
   Six days later, when he was invested as pope, John Paul II was
commending the Christianity of courage. Echoing the assurances of
the angel who told Mary of Nazareth that she would conceive and
bring forth the son of God, the 58-year-old pope told the throng in
St. Peter's Square: ``Be not afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II is not afraid--of religion's cultured despisers, of
geopoliticians who find his near-pacifism naive, of liberal
Catholics who accuse him of betraying the spirit of the Second
Vatican Council (''Vatican II''), of feminists who suspect that he
sees only two acceptable roles for women--virgin and mother.
</P>
<P>
   He is unafraid of his own infirmity, caused by advancing age and
by the residual effects of a 1981 assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, and perhaps most interesting, John Paul II has
intimated that he might be unafraid even of a downsizing of the
papal authority his charisma has done so much to dramatize.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1920 to the wife of a Polish soldier, the future pope
was a precocious intellectual, actor and poet who worked in a
quarry and a chemical plant during World War II. Imbued with the
popular Catholicism of Poland--marked by effusive devotion to the
Virgin Mary (an aspect of John Paul II's spirituality that
discomfits Protestants and liberal Catholics)-- Wojtyla began
studies for the priesthood in 1942 in an ``underground'' seminary
made necessary by the Nazi occupation.
</P>
<P>
   After the war he studied in Rome, boarding an ecclesiastical
fast track: auxiliary bishop of Krakow in 1958; archbishop in 1964;
and cardinal in 1967. Though Communist officials regarded him as
more pliable than other churchmen, he proved unafraid to confront
them in the cause of freedom for the Polish church.
</P>
<P>
   When Wojtyla was elected pope, after the 33-day reign of the
Italian John Paul I, the international press portrayed him as the
darkest of dark horses. In hindsight, his ecclesiastical networking
during and after Vatican II made him a logical candidate once it
was clear no Italian cardinal could win election.
</P>
<P>
   The rest is history, from which liberal and conservative
Catholics draw strikingly contrary conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The pope took the Gospel and his magnetic personality on the
road--forsaking the throne, on which past popes were carried
through St. Peter's Basilica, for the Popemobile.
</P>
<P>
   The year after his election, John Paul II returned to Poland for
nine days and encountered a rhapsodic reception that more than one
biographer credits with helping to sow the seeds of the Solidarity
movement's later challenge to the Communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on his world tour, which has passed through 119
countries, he kept faith with his predecessors John XXIII and Paul
VI in defending the dignity of workers and anathematizing the arms
race. He called for negotiations rather than the use of force in
the Gulf War and in Bosnia and Kosovo. He has been critical of
international sanctions against Iraq, and he hopes next year to
visit the birthplace of the biblical patriarch Abraham there.
</P>
<P>
   These and similar initiatives pleased political liberals inside
and outside the church; not so the Vatican's use of its
quasigovernmental status to oppose population-control initiatives
that the pope feared would contribute to the ``culture of death.''
</P>
<P>
   The style of John Paul II's papacy has occasioned as much
comment as its substance. Past popes were remote and magisterial
figures, but capitalizing on his relative youth, his actor's
panache, and a mastery of mass communications, John Paul II changed
all that--unafraid of diluting the papal mystique through
overexposure.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's roadshow has never had an exclusively Catholic cast.
He has met with Rome's chief rabbi and has joined in worship with
Lutheran bishops and, in a historic 1982 ceremony in Canterbury
Cathedral, with the spiritual leader of the Church of England,
which broke with Rome in the 16th century.
</P>
<P>
   Some would dismiss this as photo-op ecumenism and note that
Anglicans are not invited to take Holy Communion in Roman Catholic
churches, despite agreements by an Anglican-Roman Catholic
theological commission on the meaning of that sacrament. Anglicans
were also dismayed when Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the pope's
doctrinal watchdog, signed a document that seemed to rehabilitate a
much-criticized 1896 papal bull declaring the holy orders of
Anglican clergy ``absolutely null and utterly void.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't only in his policy toward other churches that John Paul
II is accused of preaching reform and practicing reaction. Vatican

Catholicism and set the stage for once-unthinkable innovations like
plainclothes nuns and the celebration of the Mass in English and
other modern languages.

SMOKING: ONCE A PLEASURE, NOW A VICE
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color graphic on secondhand smoke 
 By MARTHA NOLAN MCKENZIE 
 c.1999 NYT Regional Newspapers 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ashtrays have gone the way of manual typewriters in many
workplaces. As concerns about the dangers of secondhand smoke have
risen, smokers have been banished to tiny outdoor patios by many
businesses. Some employers won't let employees smoke on the job,
inside or out. And others won't let them smoke at all _ even on
their own time _ refusing to hire smokers.
</P>
<P>
   In the pitched battle between those who choose to light up and
those who don't, nonsmokers have clearly been gaining ground.
Today, 41 states restrict smoking at state government work sites
and about 74 percent of large U.S. companies have a formal policy
restricting smoking _ despite the fact that one in four adults
still smokes.
</P>
<P>
   But last year a federal judge dealt antismoking forces a blow.
In July, U.S. District Judge William Osteen, a former tobacco
industry lobbyist, ruled in favor of the tobacco industry when he
threw out a finding by the Environmental Protection Agency that
secondhand smoke caused lung cancer. The 1993 EPA report had been
used as the basis for banning smoking in many workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates on both sides of the issue debate the significance of
Osteen's ruling. Weighing in for the tobacco industry is Thomas
Humber, president of the National Smokers Alliance, a nonprofit
advocacy organization based in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we are starting to see is when fair, objective and
knowledgeable people begin to look at the so-called science on
environmental tobacco smoke, what they are finding is there is not
much there,'' Humber said. ''We will absolutely see ripple effects
from Osteen's decision. I think we'll see a reversal in policy by
some companies that have banned smoking. We are going to get back
to accepting all the diversity in this country and respecting
individual freedoms.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco opponents expect Osteen's ruling to be overturned on
appeal. ''The only fallout I've seen from Judge Osteen's decision
is misinformation,'' said Graham Kelder, managing attorney at the
Tobacco Control Resource center at Northeastern University School
of Law in Boston. ''Some people at the state and local level are
mistaken in assuming that the EPA report is the only foundation out
there on which to build local and state smoking restrictions. There
are hundreds of other studies that provide ample basis for
restricting smoking. Judge Osteen's judgment doesn't change the
science.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelder, as well as some academics and government officials,
contend it would be difficult to turn back the tide on nonsmoking
policies in the workplace, regardless of whether Osteen's ruling is
eventually overturned. The momentum against smoking is just too
strong.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, approximately 46 percent of all indoor employees worked
for an employer who had a smoke-free policy, which meant that
workers were required to either leave the building to smoke or go
to separately ventilated rooms, according to the National Cancer
Institute in Bethesda, Md. By 1996, the number had risen to 64
percent and investigators expect that to rise to 85 or 90 percent
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the restrictions is a growing belief _ regardless of
Osteen's ruling _ that secondhand smoke is harmful. Indeed,
compelling evidence is presented in myriad studies other than the
EPA's. To date, more than 50 compounds in tobacco smoke have been
identified as carcinogens.
</P>
<P>
   A recent widely quoted study by the California EPA _ which
contains data unrelated to the 1993 EPA study _ claims
environmental tobacco smoke causes 3,000 lung cancer deaths each
year; 35,000 to 62,000 heart-disease deaths; and 1,900 to 2,700
deaths from sudden infant death syndrome. The study also linked
environmental tobacco smoke to low birthweight babies, asthma and
other respiratory problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many people still don't realize that breathing tobacco smoke
might be dangerous,'' said Beverly Kingsley, an epidemiologist with
the Office on Smoking and Health at the CDC. ''They feel that if
they are not smoking, they are not in danger. But evidence is
really accumulating that tobacco smoke is tobacco smoke is tobacco
smoke. Any level of exposure _ even a very low level _ may carry
some risk.''
</P>
<P>
   And while most studies have focused on secondhand smoke in the
home _ a nonsmoker living with a smoking spouse _ the workplace is
an important source of exposure. ''If someone is at work eight
hours a day breathing in someone else's smoke, that can be a
significant health risk, as much as living with a smoker,'' said
Kingsley. ''Workers in blue collar and service occupations are
particularly at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Curbing that risk was the impetus for Milliken &AMP; Co.'s
smoke-free policy. Since 1990, the 16,000 employees of the
Spartanburg, S.C.-based textile and chemical manufacturing company
have been required to go outside to light up.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our smoking policy was a natural outgrowth of our corporate
safety policy, which says we believe all accidents are preventable,
all health risks are controllable and management is accountable,''
said Richard Dillard, Milliken's director of public affairs.
''Cigarette smoke is a known health hazard, and our primary concern
is for the health of our associates.''
</P>
<P>
   Smokers can impose other costs on their employers, as well.
According to the American Cancer Society, smokers miss work more
often than nonsmokers, use more medical benefits and raise costs
for building maintenance and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies believe curtailing these costs comes at too high
a price. ''Our smoking policy says that smoking tobacco is an
individual preference,'' said Sandra Deem, vice president of
corporate relations for First Union Corp. in Charlotte, N.C.
''Smoking is prohibited in certain areas, such as in vaults. In
other areas, we trust our employees to use good judgment. We want
to respect the differences in choices among our employees.''
</P>
<P>
   But many other employers contend smoking restrictions make good
business sense. In addition to restricting smoking to outdoor areas
or separately ventilated rooms, a growing number of businesses are
charging smokers more for their health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   At Arthur Andersen, an international management consulting firm,
for example, employees who smoke must pay $300 more per year for
their health insurance. ''It is stated very plainly on the printed
information we give out that it costs more for smokers to pay for
their health insurance,'' said Ellen Wile, spokeswoman for Arthur
Andersen.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are going even further, refusing to hire workers
who smoke. In Atlanta, for example, Turner Broadcasting System has
a policy against hiring smokers. While many states have passed
legislation making it illegal to discriminate based on smoking
status, in other states it is perfectly legal.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the absence of a statute, private employers can make any
decision they want in regard to hiring and firing,'' said John
Banzhaf, executive director of Action on Smoking and Health and a
professor at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. ''We
prohibit discrimination only based on race, origin and gender,
because these are characteristics that we can't change. But when
you look at smoking, people can choose to do it or not. And there
are very rational reasons why one would want to have a smokefree
work force.''

ICE CREAM: FAVORITE OF NERO, GEORGE WASHINGTON AND ALL AMERICANS
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color photo of a little boy eating an ice cream cone 
 By LORI B. MURRAY 
 c.1999 Lori B. Murray

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I scream. You scream. We all scream for ice cream.'' And
people have been screaming for the popular dessert for centuries.
When the not-so-popular Roman emperor, Nero, wanted a cold dessert
for his lengthy feasts, he sent slaves up the mountains to fetch
snow and mix it with fruit pulp, honey, and nectar.
 &UR; HISTORY OF ICE CREAM &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Marco Polo refined the concept of cold desserts. When he
returned home from his travels in the Orient, he brought with him a
recipe for the flavored ices the Chinese were so fond of. Unlike
Nero's treats, the Chinese added milk to their ices, making a type
of sherbet. The valued recipe spread throughout Italy, and
eventually France.
</P>
<P>
   But ice cream as we know it today was not created until the time
of the exploration of the New World. In the Chinese sherbets, ice
was one of the ingredients, and it was mixed in a bowl with crushed
fruit, juice or milk. The new ice cream, however, required that the
milk or cream be placed in a bowl, combined with fruit, sugar or
chocolate, and surrounded with ice instead.
</P>
<P>
   Ice cream was a favorite of some of our country's early
presidents. George Washington is reputed to have spent $200 on ice
cream during the summer of 1790. Thomas Jefferson learned how to
make ice cream while he was a diplomat of France, and he continued
making his 18-step recipe after returning home. James Madison's
wife, Dolly, created a sensation when she served pink ice cream as
a dessert in the White House at the second Presidential Inaugural
Ball in 1812.
</P>
<P>
   Ice cream took a big step in 1846 when Nancy Johnson invented
the hand-cranked ice cream freezer. She failed to patent her
invention, however, and a similar type was patented in 1848. It
wasn't long after this, in 1851, that Jacob Fussell established the
first commercial ice cream plant.
</P>
<P>
   Ice cream sodas grew in popularity at soda fountains throughout
the United States. During the 1890's in America, a law was passed
against serving ice cream sodas on Sundays. It was believed that if
sodas were prohibited that people would quit hanging around
drugstores on Sunday, a day which was intended for rest and quiet.
But in Evanston, Ill., one drugstore owner fought the battle by
pouring soda syrup over ice cream in a dish. He called this
soda-less soda the ``Ice Cream Sunday,'' later changed to
``sundae'' to avoid getting into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   America's favorite treat _ the ice cream cone _ emerged at the
St. Louis World's Fair on July 23, 1904. Ernest Hamwi was making
waffle pastries in a booth next to one of the many popular ice
cream booths. When the ice cream stand ran out of dishes, Hamwi
quickly rolled one of his waffles into the shape of a cone, and he
gave it to the ice cream vendor, who wasted no time in filling it
with ice cream. The rest is history.
 &UR; ICE CREAM FUN FACTS &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Today, each American consumes an average of approximately 15
quarts of ice cream a year. The big business of ice cream causes
people across the country to stand in line for their favorite ice
cream and their favorite flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it be frozen custard, sherbet, or sorbet, no one can
question the phenomenal growth of the treat that everyone loves.
And in spite of the creation of an innumerable amount of flavors,
at least half of the ice cream eaten in this country is vanilla.
Chocolate comes in second place, followed by strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite flavors are as varied as the United States itself. In
New England, for example, coffee ice cream is popular. If you visit
Texas, you'll discover that butter pecan is the hands-down
favorite. In many areas of the South, peach is prominent. In
central Ohio, black walnut is a big seller.
 &UR; ICE CREAM CELEBRATIONS &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An easy way to entertain friends and family during the summer is
with an ice cream sundae or tasting party. Have a
``Make-Your-Own-Sundae'' party where guests can create their own
extravaganza. Just dish up the ice cream and offer a line-up of
condiments including toppings, fruits, nuts, jimmies, crushed
candies, chocolate chips, coconut, and whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   Or host a ``Taste Test'' party, offering your guests several
brands of the same flavor, including supermarket and gourmet ice
creams. Secretly label the bottoms of the dishes with the names of
the brands, fill the dishes, mix them up, and start sampling. It'll
be fun to discover that the same flavor can, indeed, taste very
different. Perhaps your family members or guests could vote on
everyone's favorite ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you make your own, buy it at the supermarket, or visit
your favorite ice cream parlor, one thing is certain. All screaming
aside, ice cream brings a smile to everyone's face.

GIVE THAT OLD TUB A NEW LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Wish you could flush your porcelain, Fiberglas or
acrylic tub and vanity sink down the toilet because the colors are
outdated, stained or badly chipped?
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about buying new or ripping your old bathroom apart.
Get your tub and sink resurfaced, which isn't nearly as costly as
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a popular way to go,'' said Terry Thomas, owner of Perma
Glaze in Westford, N.Y. ``Everything is done right in your home
without removing anything. It takes about 4 1/2 hours to resurface
a standard-size 5-foot-long tub and 48 hours for it to cure before
you can use it.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost for the tub is approximately $300, depending on the
amount of prep work involved, such as filling in chips and removing
old paint. Fiberglas tubs may cost more, because the walls that go
around them are often resurfaced to match.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas doesn't resurface toilets, hot tubs or kitchen sinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can transform a tub into any color, even from black to
white, although 90 percent of the tubs I do are refinished in
white,'' said Thomas, who has owned her franchise for seven years.
Thomas said that refinishing a tub also allows you to match or
coordinate your tub and sink with your wallpaper or tile.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the tile is in relatively good shape, it can be resurfaced
to match your existing or resurfaced tub,'' Thomas explained.
</P>
<P>
   The resurfacing process involves cleaning the surface with an
etching cream, filling any chips, priming it and spray painting
with the desired color.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on use and care, a resurfaced tub or sink will hold up
for 10 years or more.
</P>
<P>
   Special care means rinsing the tub or sink after each use to
keep soap and water deposits from building up on the surface. Don't
leave rubber tub mats on the bottom of the tub, where water
deposits, dirt and mold can collect.
</P>
<P>
   Use only liquid cleansers, not abrasives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The care is really just like the directions you'd find on new
tubs or sinks,'' Thomas said.

A WORLD DOWN UNDER RECALLS THE SCOURGE OF SLAVERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL LOPEZ  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Brooklyn is a brash, open-faced place, where a church
festival culminates when 100 men parade an 85-foot devotional tower
through the streets, where coffee drinkers cut to the chase by
ordering, in their consonant-light accent, ``Light, one sug-a,''
and where patrons sit, shoulder-to-shoulder, to eat Puerto Rican
fare in a steaming cuchifrito stand.
</P>
<P>
   Still, quieter sanctuaries and secret places here speak,
hauntingly, to one of the nation's most traumatic and dramatic
historic chapters: slavery and the Underground Railroad.
</P>
<P>
   Under the borough of New York City that launched great ships and
Jackie Robinson, and made bubble gum and beer, is the vestige of
the Underground Railroad's secret escape route. In the basement of
Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church is a labyrinth of dark, grimy
brick tunnels, their arched openings reported to have led to safe
havens for the enslaved on the run.
</P>
<P>
   Above ground, on a sparkling July afternoon, are more definitive
artifacts: the poignant garden statue of famed preacher Henry Ward
Beecher, who conducted auctions at Plymouth Church, not to sell
slaves, but to buy their freedom; or the church's Pew 89, where
Abraham Lincoln worshiped on Feb. 26, 1860, the day before he
outlined his position on slavery in a speech that won him the
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Ducking and squinting in the cool darkness of Lafayette's
subterranean tunnels imparts a sense of the experience of the
enslaved, groping their way to freedom in a borough that was once a
major slaveholder, in a North that upheld fugitive-slave laws.
</P>
<P>
   African-Americans in particular who visit the tunnels for the
first time sometimes have, in the words of tour guide Fred B.
Laverpool Sr., a ``visceral experience, of being in the presence of
their ancestors.''
</P>
<P>
   Such moments consolidate what Laverpool calls ``the single most
dramatic statement against slavery.'' The Underground Railroad
``encouraged people to run away.''
</P>
<P>
   Slavery and the Underground Railroad may not seem to appeal to
tourists accustomed to theme-park vacations. But Laverpool, who
began this tour a year ago, and others in the tourism trade, are
riding a tailwind of public interest in such history.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service almost a decade ago began studying how
to organize and interpret hundreds of Underground Railroad sites.
The research fueled grass-roots interest, which in turn influenced
passage of the 1998 federal law authorizing the agency to create
this historic freedom trail, said Diane Miller, the service's
Midwest Region Underground Railroad coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Underground Railroad tours have begun in New York and other
states. In New York City, a task force is working to promote black
heritage in tourism, introducing this history to the mainstream and
beyond Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Laverpool's ``Braggin' About Brooklyn'' bus and walking tours
introduce their audience to New York beyond Manhattan with an
emphasis on the borough's African-American roots.
</P>
<P>
   A Brooklyn native whose African-American family dates back four
generations here, Laverpool, courteous, almost courtly, brings
hometown pride to his narrative.
</P>
<P>
   On a mid-July afternoon, Laverpool, 52, a New York City Transit
Authority undercover investigator who is on medical disability
leave, combined aspects of the bus and walking tour. He started by
driving across the Manhattan Bridge, for a brief detour to lower
Manhattan, and the once-forgotten 18th-century African Burial
Ground.
</P>
<P>
   Here, near City Hall, a grassy plot surrounded by a chain-link
fence seems an odd oasis amid a land of concrete at Duane Street
and Broadway. But it is a somber reminder of early African history
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath five city blocks here are the remains of 20,000 Africans
buried in the 1700s, and forgotten, until excavation for a federal
office complex in 1991 unearthed hundreds of coffins. The unearthed
remains were studied at Howard University in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery reveals what had been an underestimated, largely
enslaved African population in colonial New York; one study of the
remains found that many who were buried here were worked to death
even before the age of 12.
</P>
<P>
   Bystanders, overhearing Laverpool, walked up to hear him stress
the importance of remembering this patch. Was the cemetery
presumably erased because it held the remains of blacks?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, my answer to that is, `correct,''' Laverpool said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Across the East River, Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims, in the
leafy, genteel neighborhood of Brooklyn Heights, is an 1850
Congregational meeting house whose placid atmosphere today cannot
convey the exciting leadership of Henry Ward Beecher, brother of
abolitionist writer Harriet Beecher Stowe.
</P>
<P>
   The forward-thinking Beecher is best known for his anti-slavery
sensibility, but he also championed women's rights, early
Christian-Jewish dialogue and Darwin's theory of evolution, the
church's historic notes say.
</P>
<P>
   Plymouth was known as the ``Grand Central Terminal'' of the
Underground Railroad, with a reported serpentine trail underneath
the church.
</P>
<P>
   Beecher also publicly rescued slaves in his auctions to buy
their freedom.
</P>
<P>
   In the church's Orange Street garden, a statue by sculptor
Gutzon Borglum, who created Mount Rushmore, depicts Beecher,
standing benevolently by Pinky, the 10-year-old girl whose freedom
is about to be secured.
</P>
<P>
   An exhibit in Plymouth's Hillis Arcade makes the story more
personal. It includes a photograph of Pinky as a mature woman, Rose
Ward Hunt, radiating dignity. The freedom ring Beecher gave her in
1860 is on display as well.
</P>
<P>
   She returned the ring to the church on Plymouth's 80th
anniversary in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   Lafayette has a long tradition of community activism. As an
example, the New York Times several years ago reported how this
integrated congregation is given to protesting child labor in
Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Laverpool on his tour brings people to the foundation of this
activism, in the church's basement tunnels. ``This church was one
of the safe houses. The slaves were brought here and hidden in the
basement,'' Laverpool said, citing church oral and written history.
</P>
<P>
   Such sanctuary was temporary, since these tunnels are believed
to have led runaway slaves to other neighborhood locations where
they'd find safe shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the eerie basement catacomb, Laverpool said, ``Freedom
is not a gift. These are some of the places you had to go to be
free.''

CENTURY'S LAST SOLAR ECLIPSE AVAILABLE ON WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It will be ``lights out,'' celestially speaking,
for the last time this century when a solar eclipse plunges
portions of Europe and Asia into darkness on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if you don't plan to be in the United Kingdom, Turkey or
other countries destined for a blackout that day, don't fret: The
rare cosmic show will be available on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   A solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between the sun and
the Earth, causing the lunar shadow to fall on our planet. To the
ancients, a solar eclipse was good reason for wailing and gnashing
of teeth. Even today, some traditional cultures bang drums and sing
songs to drive away the monster presumed to be eating the sun.
</P>
<P>
   The coming eclipse will start over the western Atlantic and
extend to Karachi, Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Television pictures of the eclipse _ to be recorded by a team
from San Francisco's Exploratorium science museum at the town of
Amasya, located east of Ankara, Turkey _ will be transmitted to the
Web and the Exploratorium via a NASA satellite.
</P>
<P>
   The Amasya team also will conduct scientific observations of the
eclipse, including one of its eeriest phenomena, shadow bands.
These are faint, fast-moving, shadowy ripples seen on the ground
during total eclipses.
</P>
<P>
   Exploratorium physicist Paul Doherty recalled seeing shadow
bands during a 1970 solar eclipse, and ``they looked exactly liked
ripples in water. ... Now we strongly believe they are caused by
refraction (of light) caused by temperature differences in the
Earth's atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Doherty and his colleagues plan to observe the ripples as they
move across a large white sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being a top-notch astronomical spectacle, the sky show
will indirectly shed light on a pressing terrestrial question: Is
Earth's climate changing? The question is complicated partly
because scientists are unsure whether the sun's diameter or
brightness vary subtly over time, enhancing planetary cooling or
warming.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, scientists scattered across the ``path of
totality'' _ the path of the moon's shadow, thousands of miles long
_ will gauge the solar diameter by measuring the precise times that
totality begins and ends.
</P>
<P>
   Solar eclipses have played important roles in the history of
astronomy.
</P>
<P>
   During eclipses in the 18th and 19th centuries, astronomers
noticed flame-shaped eruptions from the solar surface. These are
now known to be ejections of subatomic particles that interfere
with terrestrial power lines and radio communications.
</P>
<P>
   The most renowned eclipse discovery came in the late 1910s, when
British scientist Arthur Stanley Eddington measured the precise
positions of stars near the eclipsed sun.
</P>
<P>
   The stars' apparent positions varied slightly from those
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   This observation verified Albert Einstein's then-controversial
prediction that the mass of the sun would distort the path of a
beam of starlight by a certain angle. Einstein thus became an
overnight celebrity, and his general theory of relativity
revolutionized physics and cosmology.
</P>
<P>
   The eclipse begins at 7:28 a.m. Eastern Wednesday. Further
information is available at a Web site:
www.exploratorium.edu/eclipse. The eclipse also will be televised
live over NASA Select and on the Web site.

THE GARDEN STATE LOOKS BETTER ALL THE TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Consider these public contradictions about
privacy:
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Boy Scouts were told by the New Jersey Supreme
Court that they could not expel gays. The Scouts had claimed they
could do so because they are a private organization.
</P>
<P>
   Next March, right-wingers will try to end recognition of gay
marriages in California, claiming marriage is a public institution.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Definition of Marriage Initiative'' basically says
marriage is such a foundation of American society that government
should control it.
</P>
<P>
   Pardon my confusion, but are the thousands of scouts meeting in
public schools doing something more private than what couples do in
bedrooms?
</P>
<P>
   The only consistency here is that some Americans think gays
shouldn't be allowed to tie any knots, whether they require
licenses, or bring merit badges.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, New Jersey, for bringing sanity to this. The state
that gave us Bruce Springsteen's songs of the working man, George
Washington's victory over the Hessians and the Meadowlands' gift to
football owners, struck another blow for individual freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Supreme Court in a unanimous decision rejected
the Boy Scouts' argument that homosexuality is immoral, saying the
Boy Scouts are ``not distinctly'' private and can't expel a scout
for being gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``One particular stereotype that we renounce today is that
homosexuals are inherently immoral,'' wrote New Jersey Supreme
Court Justice Alan B. Handler.
</P>
<P>
   I wish California had that attitude about gays who want to get
married. I'm not laughing at any more jokes about the smells of New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a New Jersey guy, and I just think it's poetic justice,''
said Tom Ammiano, president of the San Francisco Board of
Supervisors. ``I'm a Bruce Springsteen fan, a fan of New Jersey
girls with their big hairdos, and I'm proud as hell of New
Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   The Golden State hasn't shone on this issue. Last year the
California Supreme Court said the Boy Scouts are a private
organization and can expel gays.
</P>
<P>
   Right. The Scouts are so private they sign up any kid willing to
wear a scarf. That included Ammiano when he was young. He quit out
of boredom.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years ago, when Ammiano was on the school board, he fought
to bar the Boy Scouts from recruiting in public schools because the
Scouts are a discriminatory organization.
</P>
<P>
   That caused a controversy, but most San Franciscans have come
around to as progressive a position as New Jersey has.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey case is likely to end up in the U.S. Supreme
Court, and the Boy Scouts again can argue on the basis of the First
Amendment right of freedom of association.
</P>
<P>
   Here in California, anti-gay forces are going in the other
direction, against freedom of association in marriage with the
Definition of Marriage Initiative, sponsored by Republican state
Sen. William ``Pete'' Knight of Palmdale.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the ballot measure have raised about $1 million.
The Mormon Church has caused a stir because its leaders in Salt
Lake City have urged members to contribute money to the cause.
</P>
<P>
   There were a lot of bad jokes about the Mormons' polygamous
definition of marriage that held until 1890. Multiple wives weren't
outlawed until Utah was in line to become a state.
</P>
<P>
   I get queasy when San Franciscans make fun of Mormons, and not
just because religion should be respected as much as marital
choice.
</P>
<P>
   In 1846 the ship Brooklyn arrived here from New York with Elder
Samuel Brannan and 237 other Mormons. They doubled the population
of San Francisco, then called Yerba Buena, and Brannan founded the
first public school in this town.
</P>
<P>
   It's also worth remembering that Joseph Smith, the founder of
the Church of the Latter-day Saints, enjoyed wrestling, dancing and
even an occasional drink. He once wrote, ``Men are that they might
have joy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mormon Church should remember that line. It's unfortunate
that a church persecuted in the 19th century, partly over marriage
practices, should try to do the same to other Americans a century
later.
</P>
<P>
   The Definition of Marriage Initiative is in the mean-spirited,
empty tradition of the anti-immigrant Proposition 187 and the
anti-affirmative action Proposition 209.
</P>
<P>
   Much money will be spent, much ink spilled and much ill will
stirred. In the end, we'll be left with a stench in California, and
maybe even an urge to move to New Jersey.

WHY THE FIRST FAMILY IS FAIR GAME FOR THE NEWS MEDIA 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ I'm not sure precisely how it happened, but I
seem to have been selected as the unofficial spokesman in my town
for American journalism.
</P>
<P>
   When John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane went down off Martha's Vineyard
a few weekends ago, I heard from dozens of e-mail correspondents
and callers to my voice mail complaining about an excess of news
coverage on the topic, like I really have something to say about
how CNN covers stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Trust me, CNN seldom requests my guidance. NBC does not solicit
my advice. OK, Dan Rather does call me several times a week,
begging me to tell him what to do, but I've told the guy repeatedly
that he's totally on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the calls and e-mails roar in, demanding that I explain
why some event or other gets too much or too little coverage. It
happened again after an interview with Hillary Rodham Clinton in
the premier edition of Talk magazine made news.
</P>
<P>
   In this interview, Mrs. Clinton explained that her husband's
inability to keep his paws off other women stems from his
childhood. His mother and grandmother fought for his affection, she
said. So what choice did he have in adulthood but to live life as a
compulsive horndog?
</P>
<P>
   Why did Mrs. Clinton say this? Who knows? She might just have
blurted it out. She's a bright, capable person, but she has been
under some strain lately. Maybe the remark was carefully calculated
to portray her husband's most conspicuous character flaw as sort of
a medical disorder. In any event, her approval rating in a Zogby
Poll went up after that interview and, oddly, after she backed off
the remark a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   Most people who contacted me felt that this was not newsworthy.
Why does the media _ and I recall with some wistfulness when we
were reviled merely as the press _ insist on digging into this
couple's marriage? Is nothing scared? Is privacy totally dead?
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually, you reasonably can expect a certain infringement
on your privacy when you become president. If you're willing to
respond to questions about what kind of underwear you wear, you
probably shouldn't be too surprised at questions about why you feel
compelled to pounce on every female who winks in your direction.
</P>
<P>
   Why is this news? Because it's the stuff of history, I guess.
That's why there's so much interest on the part of historians in
whether Thomas Jefferson really did father one or more of Sally
Hemmings' children. That's why the true nature of the relationship
between Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his activist wife, Eleanor,
has been of such interest to scholars.
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, Nancy Reagan's influence on her husband's
policies had a huge impact on people around the globe. Abraham
Lincoln's rocky marriage with his wife, Mary, was part of who this
enormously significant man was and why we should care about him.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most crucial presidential marriage was the one
between Woodrow Wilson and his wife, Edith. When he suffered a
horrible stroke that virtually blinded him and left him
half-paralyzed, she served as a de facto president. Surely she had
impact on his firm, adamant refusal to compromise with Congress on
American membership in the League of Nations, a decision that
played a huge role in the creating World War II.
</P>
<P>
   And I would love to say more about this, but my phone is
ringing. It's probably Rather again.
</P>
<P>
   The poor schnook won't give me a moment's peace.

TV: THE GREAT AMERICAN SCOURGE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ When the American Academy of Pediatrics last week
cautioned parents that children under the age of 2 should not be
permitted to watch television because it endangered their health,
it was not breaking new ground.
</P>
<P>
   The pediatricians joined a long list of others, including
psychologists and social scientists, who earlier warned about the
negative impact of television watching on young people.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, America's kids devote more time to the tube, by
all reports even more than their counterparts in other parts of the
world. Their parents are not interfering with this particular bad
habit. And the ugly truth is that television is for many parents
too convenient a baby sitter or youth companion to be monitored too
closely.
</P>
<P>
   In more and more households, both parents are off to work during
the week, and when they finally get home, they are confronted with
the ever-present chores of housekeeping. Mothers in general bear
most of that burden and single ones have to deal with it by
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The price paid for using television to occupy kids' time is that
they are relentlessly exposed to mind-crunching programming.
Watching television without let or hindrance dulls the mind,
deadens the senses and makes you fat. No more studies are needed to
document that television watching is not good for the kids, who, it
is also argued, can become sociopaths from seeing too much violence
day after day.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the small mountain of studies of kids and television may
not be as reliable as their authors suppose. Nevertheless, common
sense should teach us to rely on what we can see for ourselves.
Kids are exercising less and consequently becoming more portly.
Their school work, as measured in standard examinations, is
underwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is more at stake in television watching. If it's bad
for the kids, it is no better for the grownups.
</P>
<P>
   Television is putrefying American culture with its lack of
sensibility and nuance. Not everything on television is worthless;
valuable or entertaining programming is there to be found. But
taken together, the good television is routinely swamped by the
garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Now it may be argued that popular culture by definition is
kitsch. Through the decades, mass entertainments have had little to
recommend them except their banality. But television made it much
worse, more quickly, because of the immensity of its reach, its
singular ability to define and then dominate popular culture. It
imposes a continental uniformity, finding riches without end in
nurturing the lowest common denominator and then talking down to
it.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always thus. When television first appeared, it was
hailed as a marvel that would bring the wider world into every
home, expanding exponentially the possibilities for educating and
informing multitudes. Those early years were by definition
innovative, as the art of the new communication form evolved.
</P>
<P>
   In drama and in comedy, in news programming and in special
events coverage, television did much to bring the world into
tighter focus, and to expose its audiences to people and places
they would otherwise have never seen close up.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively early on, however, the owners of television imposed
on themselves imperatives that led programming into the wasteland.
The battle ever since has been to get the proprietors to improve
their product. It is a battle that is harder to win each successive
season.
</P>
<P>
   Except for sporting events or those ever-rarer programs with
content and sense, television has become a big bore. Even if it
were not to encourage slothfulness and apathy, television's
mindlessness kills time, dispirits creativity and annoys, all at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Commercialism is devouring the very thing that made possible
entirely new lines of business. Save for a couple of stations, you
cannot watch a film without suffering through constant break-ins
for ads. Advertising is certainly legitimate in and of itself, but
its heavy-footed imprint on the total presentation has overwhelmed
content.
</P>
<P>
   It makes little sense to watch a movie on television unless you
are interested in the ads, some of which, ironically or otherwise,
are much cleverer than what appears in the short intervals between
them.
</P>
<P>
   In the final analysis, neither doctors nor social workers can
protect children from the punishing habits of television watching
if parents continue to abdicate their responsibilities to supervise
their children.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, unless and until adults reject their exploitation by
the medium, there's no chance that television will revive those
values that once made it an authentic phenomenon of culture.

THE TIME HAS COME FOR LENNY BRUCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lenny Bruce is back in style and the ironies are so
crushing, you don't know whether to laugh or cry.
</P>
<P>
   Here was a stand-up comedian who was hounded and hammered to his
knees for saying words now uttered routinely on HBO. So it's
fitting _ a thank-you note, of sorts _ that HBO is airing a
documentary of his life, ``Lenny Bruce: Swear to Tell the Truth,''
Monday at 10:15.
</P>
<P>
   As a bonus, the Museum of Television &AMP; Radio in Manhattan is
showing, through Oct. 3, a compilation of all of Bruce's TV
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   It is no longer risky to hail Bruce as a great social critic and
satirist. His monologues on race relations, sexual mores, and
organized religion are widely admired as pathbreakers _ and they
remain as trenchant as any comic's reflections since.
</P>
<P>
   But in his heyday _ from the late-1950s until 1966, when he OD'd
at the age of 40 _ Bruce was more commonly denounced as a ``sick
comic.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, he reveled in both images. There was a menacing
quality to Lenny Bruce that time has not erased. It was what so
thrilled his fans and so shocked everyone else. You see it now and
then in the HBO and museum films _ those too-penetrating eyes, that
machine-gun cackle of a laugh, the shifty cocksureness of being on
to a hushed-up truth.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce was an authentic hipster, a living prototype of Norman
Mailer's ``White Negro,'' teetering defiantly on the edge. He
considered himself as much jazz musician as comic. In the HBO film,
Nat Hentoff says Bruce ``turned around the notion of what American
comedy could be,'' much as Charlie Parker and John Coltrane turned
around jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Hentoff is talking about not just substance but rhythm. Bruce
may have been the only white entertainer to speak in jazz argot _
``dig,'' ``man,'' ``flip,'' ``cool,'' ``cook,'' ``swing,''
``crazy'' _ without sounding ridiculous. He improvised like a
jazzman, too, riffing on his routines, altering and adding ideas as
they came to him, right on stage, spontaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Both films fall short in conveying this vitality. They offer a
taste of it in an excerpt from a 1959 Steve Allen Show, in which
Bruce does his bit about the first boy to get high off airplane
glue (``I'll be the Louis Pasteur of junkiedom!''). But his TV
spots were fairly tame, and the few films of live performances were
made late in his career, after deterioration had set in.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce was first arrested in Philadelphia, for possession of
narcotics, on Sept. 29, 1961. Five days later, he was busted in San
Francisco on obscenity charges, for using the famous 10-letter
word. Over the next 2 1/2 years, he was arrested five times, in Los
Angeles, Chicago, and New York. Appeals courts overturned the
charges in every case, but gigs dried up. He died a pauper, if also
a martyr.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Krassner, his friend and spiritual heir, says Bruce's real
offense was blasphemy, not obscenity, and indeed his troubles came
mainly from DAs and judges who despised his digs at the Catholic
Church. (I suspect, even now, HBO might think twice about
broadcasting ``Religions, Inc.'' or ``Christ and Moses'' in their
entirety.)
</P>
<P>
   His busts set off a spiral of self-destruction, and he grew less
and less funny. On Feb. 3, 1961, before his legal troubles began,
Bruce gave a sold-out midnight concert at Carnegie Hall that still
stands as one of the funniest and most profound comedy shows ever.
(You can hear it on CD.) Nine months later, soon after his first
two busts, the decline was already apparent. His act became more
about his busts, less about the rest of the world. His comic bits
were jumbled, his delivery clouded in rage.
</P>
<P>
   By 1965, he was obsessed. A concert that year at Berkeley was
one long harangue, a recitation of court transcripts and _ as if he
wanted more trouble _ an endless stream of obscenities. (The
Carnegie Hall concert contained almost no profanity.)
</P>
<P>
   The saddest part of the HBO film comes near the end _ a photo of
Bruce, deep dark orbs encasing half-dead eyes. For all his jabs at
society, he revered the American system and couldn't quite believe
how blatantly its guardians were breaking their own rules. It
unnerved him, twisted him.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Rock, the closest thing to our day's Lenny Bruce, always
denies he's a social critic. ``I'm just a comedian,'' he insists.
He must know this is nonsense, but he's smart to keep up the
pretense. Lenny Bruce went sour when he began to act otherwise.
``I'm not a comedian, I'm Lenny Bruce,'' he told a nightclub
audience in 1962. He never pulled out of the trance.

WHICH COURT GOT IT RIGHT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled last week that the Boy Scouts
of America is a ``place of public accommodation'' _ like a diner or
a motel _ and that it therefore broke the state's
antidiscrimination law when it expelled a scoutmaster, James Dale,
because of his homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, said the court, the Boy Scouts may not take shelter in
the First Amendment, for they have no message about gays that can
claim constitutional protection. After all _ hang on, reader, here
comes a curve _ it's not as if the Boy Scouts actively encourage
the idea that there is something wrong with homosexuality. Only if
they were more explicitly antigay, the justices reasoned, would the
Constitution guarantee their right to keep homosexuals out.
</P>
<P>
   Bizarre, no? Listen to the court:
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy Scouts' expulsion of Dale is based on little more than
prejudice and not on a unified Boy Scout position. . . . Boy
Scouts' activities are designed to build character and instill
moral principles. Nothing before us, however, suggests that one of
Boy Scouts' purposes is to promote the view that homosexuality is
immoral. Accordingly . . . the LAD (Law Against Discrimination)
does not infringe upon Boy Scouts' right of expressive
association.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Boy Scouts may not bar gays from being
scoutmasters because they don't denounce homosexuality
(itals)enough.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   The court's weird logic is wrong on both counts. On the one
hand, Boy Scouts of America has always made it clear that it
disapproves of homosexuality. On the other hand, the fact that
Scouts do not begin each troop meeting with an anti-gay diatribe
doesn't mean that their view on the subject isn't constitutionally
protected.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, the California Supreme Court decided a similar
case. Timothy Curran, a Boy Scout troop leader, decided to ``come
out'' to his high school classmates by taking a male date to the
senior prom. When a photo of the couple appeared in the Oakland
Tribune, Curran was told that he could no longer take part in
scouting activities. He, too, filed suit, arguing (like Dale) that
in refusing to admit gays the Boy Scouts were violating
California's civil-rights law.
</P>
<P>
   The case eventually reached the state's highest court.
``Membership in the Boy Scouts is not simply a ticket of admission
to a recreational facility that is open to a large segment of the
public and has all the attributes of a place of public amusement,''
the court held. ``Scouts meet regularly in small groups (often in
private homes) that are intended to foster close friendship, trust,
and loyalty, and scouts are required to participate in a variety of
activities, ceremonies, and rituals designed to teach the moral
principles to which the organization subscribes.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those principles: the Scouts' well-known view of
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence introduced at trial,'' the justices wrote,
``demonstrated `that the Boy Scouts of America as an organization
has taken a consistent position that homosexuality is immoral and
incompatible with the Boy Scout Oath and Law' and that `this is the
view that is communicated whenever the issue comes up.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is true that Boy Scout literature shies away from
(itals)explicit(unitals) discussions of sexuality. In general,
Scout leaders are discouraged from bringing up sexual topics. Sex,
the organization believes, is a subject for the home. But the fact
that an organization doesn't shout its opinions as loudly as
possible does not mean that it loses its right to express those
opinions. And the right to express an opinion entails the right not
to provide a forum for those who contradict it. That was the point
that the US Supreme Court underlined so emphatically in the South
Boston St. Patrick's Day parade case in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In the Boston case, an Irish-American gay group, GLIB, wanted to
march in the annual St. Patrick's Day parade. Like the Boy Scouts,
the Boston parade is privately organized. The parade organizers
insisted that GLIB's celebration of gay pride was incompatible with
the parade's traditional themes. Under the First Amendment, they
argued, no one should be able to force them to include an
organization whose message they didn't want to promote.
</P>
<P>
   GLIB sued. As the plaintiffs in the Boy Scout cases did, it
claimed the parade was effectively a place of public accommodation
_ like a diner or a motel _ and so its organizers shouldn't be
allowed to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. Every
Massachusetts court ruled in GLIB's favor. But the US Supreme Court
reversed, 9-0. Private groups have an absolute right to control
their message, the high court said, no matter how blatant or muted
that message may be.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, it stressed that the Constitution doesn't shield
only parade organizers from having their views diluted. Even a
dining club, which is hardly likely to express a message, has a
constitutional right to ``exclude an applicant whose manifest views
were at odds with a position taken by the club's existing
members.'' If that is true for a dining club, how much more so is
it true for an organization founded to instill values in boys.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey court went out of its way to blast the Boy
Scouts' views as bigotry. It even conceded that it was ruling
against them because not to ``would be tantamount to tolerating . .
. an act of discrimination.'' The California court, by contrast,
stressed that its decision ``does not turn on our personal views of
the wisdom or morality of the (Scouts') actions or policies.''
</P>
<P>
   One court, in other words, based its judgment on the judges'
personal beliefs. The other based its judgment on the law. On to
the Supreme Court.

<P>
   !!!! ``Autumn Tale'' There's more autumn sun than autumn rain in
this beautifully detailed and compassionately observed masterpiece
by France's Eric Rohmer. The film is set in motion when Marie
Riviere's Miss Fixit sets out to find a mate for her shy single
pal, Beatrice Romand, who mostly sticks to her small vineyard. It's
the vineyard that supplies the film with its central visual
metaphor of ripeness _ ripeness with a lot of mischievously
light-textured comedy. (Unrated) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``Dick'' A very funny reinvention of the Watergate scandal, as
told through the eyes of a couple of dizzy teenage girls who,
through a fluke, were in on everything. Kirsten Dunst and Michelle
Williams are fine as the loose cannonettes, but what really puts
this one into orbit is Dan Hedaya's Nixon, from his tense shoulders
to his glowering, bulging-eyed paranoia. (PG-13) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``The Iron Giant'' A winning animated version of Ted Hughes's
children's classic. It successfully transplants its Cold War
anti-weapons message from England to a coastal village in Maine,
and charms us into make-believing in the friendship between a boy
and a giant robot from outer space. They reverse traditional
parent-child roles, as the sharp kid clues in the formidably lethal
but innocent robot. (G) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! 1/2 ``My Life So Far'' A glowingly tender evocation of a
charmed boyhood in the Scottish Highlands between the wars.
Hastening the maturing of its 10-year-old protagonist are the
rambunctious energies of his family of eccentrics, from his
exuberant crackpot father to his stern but wildly romantic uncle,
who upsets the family's routines when he brings home a vivacious
young French bride. (PG) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! 1/2 ``Mystery Men'' This dark comic-book spoof of superheroes
and losers who aspire to superhero status begins on a terrific note
of comic neurotic irony, then dwindles into something very ordinary
and very long. Ben Stiller's Mr. Furious, Janeane Garofalo's
Bowler, and William H. Macy's Shoveler are the best of the bunch
who barely have power, much less superpower. (PG-13) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! 1/2 ``The Sixth Sense'' This slow, ponderous ghost story is
worth sticking with. First, because elements that don't quite add
up finally do make sense in a surprise ending. Second, because it
avoids the obviousness of special effects for a genuinely eerie
atmopshere and a permanent look of sadness weighing down the face
of an 8-year-old boy picking up the emanations of an unhappy ghost.
Bruce Willis is a surprise, too, turning in the most subdued
performance of his career as a troubled therapist determined to
help the boy. (PG-13) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! 1/2 ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' This classic heist caper and
sexual chess game has been moved from Boston to Manhattan, with
Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo in the roles originated by Steve
McQueen and Faye Dunaway. This time, the bored, emotionally
unreachable zillionaire robs a museum, not a bank. This remake has
more clever plot twists than the original, but it also spends more
time trying to be touchy-feely instead of just relaxing into its
trashiness. Besides, Brosnan lacks the nervous physicality McQueen
projected with such jumpy ease. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! 1/2 ``Trick'' A sweet little boy-meets-boy story set in
Greenwich Village and Chelsea. Christian Campbell plays a guy who
wonders if trying to write Broadway musicals is a cool career
choice; John Paul Pitoc is the go-go dancer who catches his eye and
proves surprisingly and refreshingly sensitive. The film loses
points, though, for its caricaturing of a straight woman, played
with good-sport energies by Tori Spelling. Similar stereotyping and
scapegoating of a gay character would invite storms of scorn. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! 1/2 ``The Wounds'' Potently stylized satire focusing on the
civilian casualties of the war in the former Yugoslavia from 1991
to 1996, specifically the lost youth of kids turned into nihilistic
killers. Influenced by Depression-era American gangster movies, it
begins with three 13-year-old pals throwing rocks at one another in
a graveyard in Belgrade and ends five years later with a shootout
in a city that has become one big graveyard. (Unrated)

CANDIDATES TO TEST THE TWO FACES OF IOWA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ The local news shows are broadcasting specials
called ``Crisis in the Heartland,'' the governor is warning that
one-third of Iowa's family farms could go bust, and just about
every presidential candidate stalking the first-caucus state is
promising billions of dollars in relief.
</P>
<P>
   But while this all sounds like a replay of the lean years of the
1980s, perhaps the most surprising news in Iowa this summer is that
the state is not about to sink into depression. To the contrary,
even with record low crop prices, Iowa in many ways is thriving
with an improbably low 2.5 percent unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two Iowas,'' said Governor Thomas J. Vilsack, a
Democrat whose election last year was based in large part on
cobbling together constituencies from both sectors of the state.
The state's transformation during the past decade adds an element
of unpredictability to next week's Republican straw poll and next
February's caucus.
</P>
<P>
   One Iowa is the thriving urban and suburban area, flush from a
decade of diversification into the insurance industry and
manufacturing. The other Iowa is limping down the rural road, where
the number of farms has shrunk from 145,000 in 1970 to 97,000 last
year and prospects can seem bleak.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Iowa's two economies alternately thriving and
sputtering, the question is who will show up at the straw poll on
Saturday: fearful farmers or affluent suburbanites? While the poll
is nonbinding and often derided as meaningless, many of the
candidates have placed enormous importance on it, with Texas
Governor George W. Bush staking his front-runner standing on his
belief that he can win impressively.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the presidential candidates visiting here seem to miss
the complexity of the state, according to Vilsack and other
observers. Instead, many candidates are pitching ``boilerplate''
palliatives for one of the fastest-changing economies in the United
States, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the transformation of Iowa more striking than in Des
Moines, with its numerous new skyscrapers bolstering its effort to
become an urban center of the Midwest. City officials attribute
much of the growth to their effort to become the insurance capital
of America, although Hartford, Boston, and even Omaha are doubtful
about the claim. The city is headquarters to 70 insurance
companies, including the Principal Financial Group, which
constructed a gleaming 44-story downtown office tower, the state's
tallest.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think of us as being in the middle of cornfields, but
you can go for miles in Des Moines without seeing corn,'' said Tina
Hoffman of the Greater Des Moines Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The front page of the Des Moines Register demonstrated the
state's dichotomy vividly one day last week. The lead story,
headlined, ``Posh mall is courted for West Des Moines,'' reported
that a developer was trying to lure Nordstrom's and other upscale
retailers to a neighborhood that recently has become rife with
expensive homes. But just below the fold, an article quoted Vilsack
urging hard-hit farmers to aim their comments about slumping
commodity prices at the presidential candidates touring the state.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just Des Moines that is booming on the strength of the
non-farm economy. Two hours east of here, Cedar Rapids is
attracting its share of health, manufacturing, and insurance
companies. When GOP candidate Steve Forbes spoke in Cedar Rapids
recently, he drew an enthusiastic response from about 500 people
who gathered to hear his pitch for flat taxes and his attack on
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The story of today's Cedar Rapids could be seen less than a mile
away, at the sprawling, 9,000-employee Rockwell Collins plant,
which manufactures airplane communications equipment. The company
would like to hire another 200 engineers, but it cannot find
qualified people. The story is same all over Iowa, as employers
tell of trying to lure immigrants from as far away as Bosnia to
fill the void.
</P>
<P>
   The job crunch is slowly erasing some of the stereotypes of Iowa
as bland and lily-white. While this state of nearly 3 million is 96
percent white, the Latino population is growing so fast _ now at
53,000 people _ that Bush last week made an extra effort to court
the community.
</P>
<P>
   The labor shortage at Rockwell Collins highlights what may be
the most troubling statistic about Iowa. While the state does a
stellar job ensuring that most of its residents graduate from high
school, with the 11th best rate in the nation, Iowa has one of the
lowest percentages of college graduates, ranking 42d, Vilsack said.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa suffers from a combination of ``brain drain,'' with the
best-educated people leaving the state, and a lack of high-paying
jobs outside the urban areas. The result is a state with nearly
full employment but a lower-than-average pay scale, roughly 90
percent of the national norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you sit in (West Des Moines), you think Iowa is doing
great,'' said Hugh Winebrenner, a Drake University professor and
longtime trend watcher in the state. But in most rural county
seats, ``you would find they are not doing so great because they
are so tied to agriculture. It really is the two faces of Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the urban areas, the other face of Iowa rises green and
lush, exactly as most outsiders would expect. It is possible to
drive for hours across the state and see barely any interruption of
the fields of corn and soybeans. Yet these two crops are plummeting
in value in the international market. Corn and soy fetch half the
price of a few years ago and are at the lowest point in memory.
</P>
<P>
   In Fertile Township, two hours north of Des Moines, farmer Gary
Petersburg looks upon a verdant, undulating expanse of 1,000 acres,
equally divided between corn and soy. Like his father's before him,
Petersburg's livelihood depends upon the free-market price of his
product. But unlike in his father's day, when corn may have
fluctuated by 10 cents a season, corn now spirals up and down by $1
or more. Lately, he has gotten $1.50 a bushel, down from $5 a few
years ago, and the lowest price in decades.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the drought conditions in the East, the crop here
is healthy and in oversupply, which is one reason prices are low.
``There's a lot of pessimism out here,'' said Petersburg, though he
is brimming with ideas about how to ``add value'' to his products
and cut out the middlemen. Like many farmers in the state,
Petersburg said he will be lucky this year to break even, despite
the subsidies he receives from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential candidates touring the state this
month in preparation for Saturday's straw poll have rushed to
promise their support to farmers. While many of the candidates
normally deride government subsides, nearly all of them have vowed
to back aid packages now winding through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, for example, is among the harshest critics of government
bailouts. But when asked in an interview whether he supports the
congressional proposals for increased farm subsidies, Forbes said
Congress must act immediately. Forbes said he sees no contradiction
in this position because ``government caused the problem'' by being
too tight with the supply of money and ineffective at breaking
trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, meanwhile, took the lead last week in
backing a farm aid package after his Iowa supporters warned him
that the administration's wait-and-see approach was hurting him in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates also have jumped quickly aboard the subsidy
bandwagon for ethanol, a corn-based additive for gasoline. Former
senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey once opposed the ethanol on
grounds that it was giveaway to agribusiness that had questionable
benefits. But now that he is counting on a strong showing in Iowa
in the caucus, Bradley has become an ethanol backer, saying that he
was convinced about the merits after sitting down with farmers
here.
</P>
<P>
   The only candidate who opposes the ethanol subsidy is Arizona
Senator John McCain, and his stance is so unpopular that the
Arizona Republican has decided not to compete in the straw poll and
he may not make much of an effort in the caucus. McCain said last
week that he objected to spending any more money ``on a fuel that
has no known benefits and actually takes more energy to produce
than a gallon of ethanol contains.'' These are words that few
politicians would dare utter here.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hoopla surrounding the straw poll, it is one of the
most un-democratic functions in American politics. Just one-half of
1 percent of Iowa's population is expected to participate.
</P>
<P>
   Historially, Iowa's economy has often determined the caucus
winner, although not the winner of the presidency. In 1980, George
Bush won the caucus but lost the nomination and became vice
president. In 1988, Bush came in third in the caucus because of
disenchantment with the Reagan-Bush administration, then went on to
win the nomination and the presidency.

THIS AND THAT IN PHYSICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Do you get heavier or lighter when you get to the top of a
high mountain?
</P>
<P>
   F.B., Peabody, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Lighter, and not just because of all the calories you burned
getting there. The further away from the center of the earth you
get, the weaker its gravity. But even at the top of Mt. Everest you
will only weight an ounce or two less.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. If you dug a hole all the way through the earth and dropped a
ball in one side, would it go all the way through or would gravity
make it stop in the middle?
</P>
<P>
   C.W., Concord, Mass., and D.G., West Roxbury, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. NASA physicist Doug Blanchard says if the hole was full of
air, the ball would accelerate until it reached terminal velocity,
when air pressure and friction resisting the object equal the
gravitational pull so the object can't accelerate any more. It
would be going fast enough to speed past the center of the earth.
Then it would start to slow, since more of the mass of the earth,
and therefore more of the gravitational pull, would be behind it.
It would stop just as it got to the other end of the hole, then
oscillate back and forth through the hole like a pendulum making a
shorter trip each time, until it came to a stop suspended right in
the middle, where gravity was pulling equally on it from all sides.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How fast do you have to go to escape gravity?
</P>
<P>
   A. ``You never escape gravity,'' explains NASA's Blanchard.
``It's always pulling on you. Objects that fly are just falling
slower than they're traveling.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's start from the top. Gravity is a rate of acceleration.
That's why falling objects fall faster and faster, until they reach
terminal velocity. That acceleration equals 32 feet per second per
second.
</P>
<P>
   So if you want to ``escape'' gravity, you have to jump
powerfully enough so you're going 32 feet per second (21.8 MPH)
after the first second, 64 feet per second (43.6 MPH) after two, 96
feet per second (65.4 MPH) after three, and so on. Blanchard says
for a rocket to achieve escape velocity, the speed necessary to get
far enough from the mass of the earth so gravity is weak enough
that a spacecraft can achieve orbit, it has to be reach seven miles
per second, 25,800 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   How about a pebble, or a feather? Same speeds apply. The rate of
gravity is constant. If you vary the weight of the object, you just
have to vary the power necessary to get it going fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   Since it is the mass of an object that gives it gravitational
pull, as you get further from that mass, gravity weakens. The
further you get from the earth, the weaker gravity gets. Remember
our mountain climber example above.
</P>
<P>
   But even out in orbit gravity is still pulling spacecraft down.
To stay in orbit they have to fly at just the right speed to pull
away from the curve of the earth precisely as fast as gravity is
pulling them down. Travel too slowly and the craft will drop.
Travel too fast and it will outdo the pull from below and fly off
into space.
</P>
<P>
   Astronauts and anything else in a spacecraft escape gravity and
float around weightless because, like the ship they're in, they're
moving at the precise speed at which their travel away from the
curve of the earth counteracts the gravity pulling them down.
</P>
<P>
   The higher they orbit, the slower that satellites need to go to
match the reduced gravitational pull. Communications satellites all
fly at 22,500 miles above the earth in what's called geosynchronous
orbit _ a technique first envisioned by author Arthur C. Clarke _
because at that height, the speed they need to match gravity, 5,968
MPH, keeps them over the same spot above the spinning earth below.
That way terrestrial transmitters and receivers always know where
to aim.

OLD SYMBOLS, NEW DEBATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Back when Irish immigrants confronted signs declaring
``No Irish Need Apply,'' they rallied around a symbol of their
heritage: the shamrock. But as the Irish-American community grew in
power, the shamrock took on new meaning in some of the city's
racially and ethnically diverse housing developments: Only Irish
Need Apply.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, in Charlestown's Bunker Hill housing development, the
Puerto Rican flag first appeared about a decade ago as a sign of
pride among the development's newest ethnic group. But as their
numbers increased, longtime white tenants began to see the flag as
a symbol of Puerto Ricans claiming the development as their own
turf.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of old symbols and new meanings rocketed around the city
this week, as Boston Housing Authority officials rushed to dispute
reports that the agency had equated the lucky shamrock with symbols
of hate and intimidation during sensitivity classes for its
residents.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy, which made headlines from South Boston all the
way back to Ireland, caused such an uproar among Irish Americans
that Mayor Thomas M. Menino addressed the issue, and BHA officials
scrambled to emphasize that cultural symbols are not being banned
from the housing developments.
</P>
<P>
   But while few people seriously compared the shamrock to such
potent emblems as the swastika or the Confederate flag, the dispute
highlighted a problem that Boston institutions like public housing
and the Fire Department have struggled with for years _ the
shifting meanings of cultural symbols.
</P>
<P>
   ``Symbols can be very beautiful for one person and very ugly for
another,'' said J. Lorand Matory, a cultural anthropologist at
Harvard University. ``Symbols have multiple meanings and they tend
to circulate around similar emotions, but every viewer can
interpret the sign according to his perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Matory said oppressed groups often begin using emblems of
cultural identity as a sign of strength. But as their numbers grow,
the symbol acquires more power. And what was once a sign of
confidence can become, in certain situations, a claim of dominance.
</P>
<P>
   In the abstract, ``The shamrock has no more of a negative
connotation than the American flag,'' said state Representative
Byron Rushing, a Democrat from the South End who is
African-American. ``I've always seen shamrocks on cars in Boston
for years and I've always seen it as good luck for the Irish.''
</P>
<P>
   But when used as a rallying point by those intent on showing
their power over other groups, he said, the shamrock can become as
intimidating as the clenched fists raised as black-power salutes by
some African Americans in the 1960s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many blacks continue to see the clenched fist as
nothing more than a show of pride, and they regard John Carlos and
Tommie Smith, the two Olympic sprinters who displayed the salute
during the medal ceremony at the 1968 games, as heroes.
</P>
<P>
   The salute ``meant power and unity just by the fact of the
clenched fist and the fingers united,'' said Carlos, 56, now a
track coach in Palm Springs. ``But when we did it, they tried to
say it was negative because black people were doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The same confusion over meanings exists over today's symbols.
And in Boston this week, members of different racial and ethnic
groups generally defended their rights to display whatever emblems
they choose.
</P>
<P>
   David Cortiella, the former BHA director who is Puerto Rican,
said residents of the city's housing projects who display the
Puerto Rican flag are merely showing their pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were a majority force imposing our flag, then our symbol
would be threatening, it would have a force,'' said Cortiella. But
unlike Boston's white Irish community, ``we don't control power, we
don't control institutions, and it's the same thing with blacks.''
</P>
<P>
   But Irish Americans see it differently.
</P>
<P>
   When Frank Gillespie, a native of Ireland, first opened The
Black Thorn, a restaurant in South Boston, he proudly displayed the
beloved three-leaf clover all over his business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put it in my window, in the house, and carry it around in my
pocket for luck,'' Gillespie said. ``It reminds us of where we came
from. It means we have a little Irish in us.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who believes the symbol means anything other than Irish
pride, he said, is taking political correctness too far.
</P>
<P>
   Veronica Jennings, a first-generation Irish American from
Dorchester agrees. To her, the shamrock _ believed to have been
used by St. Patrick to explain the mystery of the Holy Trinity _
connects her to her parent's homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she acknowledged that its emotional meaning lies ``in the
eyes of the person looking at it. If someone thinks it's a sign of
dominance, then they will probably find bad in anything.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, Bill O'Sullivan, a regular at the M &AMP; M
Tavern, a predominately black bar in Roxbury, was the only white
man in the place. Sipping his Budweiser, he struggled with the
varied meanings of the shamrock, and related it to his experience
at the bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all perception,'' O'Sullivan said. ``They call me `white
boy' here. I can take it two ways, it's all tongue in cheek. But if
they were wearing a dashiki and saying `white boy,' then it might
have a different meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   But James Boldin, an African-American who was standing nearby,
said he sees the shamrock as a sign of white dominance in his
hometown; a reminder that Irish in South Boston fought hard to keep
blacks out of their schools and neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shamrock means Boston is for white and not for black,'' he
insisted. He said he found it ironic that the Boston Celtics, a
predominantly black team, sports the shamrock on its warmup suits.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Twiss, the Celtics spokesman, said the name of the team as
well as its trademarks have become as much a sports tradition as
the pinstripes on the uniforms of the New York Yankees. When the
Celtics began play 50 years ago, Twiss said, its founder decided
that the team's new name and its symbol perfectly matched the city
it would represent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked around and said, `There are a lot of Irishmen in
Boston, so let's name it Celtics,' '' Twiss said. ``You could be
offended or impressed by it _ depending on what angle you are
looking at.''

`SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE' IS CRACKLING GOOD FUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``Shakespeare in Love'' _ This bright comedy
features wonderful performances and a great gimmick. The
interlacing of Shakesperean plots and character makes for crackling
good fun. But it sometimes seems as if the script, co-written by
Tom Stoppard, was designed to be played faster, at an almost
slapstick pace, instead of the slowed-down version we see here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mod Squad'' _ Another vintage TV show that dies big-time
on the big screen. The TV show, even with Clarence Williams 3d,
wasn't that good; in this incarnation, it's much worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``True Crime'' _ Clint Eastwood stars in, and directs, this
mystery about a crusading journalist. The older Eastwood gets, the
better he looks. In this film, his wrinkled, hardtack face is
perfect for the aging reporter. While the plot is fairly
predictable, Eastwood isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``20 Dates'' _ Ever since Albert Brooks's `Real Life'' in 1979,
the mock documentary has been a fascinating sub-genre. It peaked
with ``This Is Spinal Tap''; it hits rock bottom with this lame
effort from the egomaniacal, exploitative Myles Berkowitz. Neither
funny nor provocative, Berkowitz, as star-director-writer, has only
himself to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'' _ This English import
suffers a bit from the heavy accents and slang of its gritty
gangsters, but it should be easier to comprehend on home video. You
can always hit the rewind button for an instant replay. Director
Guy Ritchie's debut is remarkable. If you liked ``The Brothers
McMullen,'' this one's for you, too.

WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE: PM5K MAKES IT BIG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The limousine is parked across the street from the
outdoor cafe in the Fenway on a sunny July afternoon, and its owner
_ the guy whose head looks like an overgrown fluorescent-green
tennis ball _ clearly is the rock star having lunch. But Spider
One, frontman for Powerman 5000, is less a rock star than a local:
This was his neighborhood before he and the band moved to Los
Angeles two years ago, and though people say hi and glance his way,
no one disturbs his space.
</P>
<P>
   Fame, though, or a more heightened version thereof, may be
around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Worlds Collide,'' Powerman 5000's first single from its
second major-label album, ``Tonight the Stars Revolt!,'' was the
most frequently added song on modern- and active-rock radio formats
when it was released last month. Powerman 5000's style _ hard,
aggressive, a mix of rap and singing _ is a chart-topping one. And
this group is no genre jumper; the guys have been at it for nearly
a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``When our first record came out,'' says Spider, of the February
'97 DreamWorks re-release of '95's ``The Blood-Splat Rating
System'' (remixed and renamed ``Mega!! Kung Fu Radio''), ``I don't
know if there was a rock album on the charts that I can remember.
But now with the success of Korn, Limp Bizkit, Orgy, Kid Rock . . .
I think a lot of people assume that you want to see those other
bands fail, but I'm the opposite; I'm rooting for everybody. If
Limp Bizkit is on the radio, then we are going to be on the
radio.''
</P>
<P>
   The band's first album, Spider says, sold about 80,000 copies
without benefit of radio or MTV play. That's not bad at all. This
time, with the industry machinery behind it and the zeitgeist in
synch, Spider is optimistic. He says, ``Everybody has been avoiding
the numbers game, trying to guess what it will do, but things are
looking good. Radio is blowing up, MTV added the video _ actually
playing it during the day, which floored us.''
</P>
<P>
   This optimism seems to be warranted because in the album's first
week on the charts, it came in at No. 46 in Billboard's Top 200; it
has sold 60,000 copies in two weeks. Powerman 5000 _ nicknamed PM5K
and comprising guitarists Adam 12 and M.33, bassist Dorian 27, and
drummer Al 3 _ plays Avalon Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Less rooted in rage
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While PM5K shares a kind of sonic-assault approach with Limp
Bizkit and company, it is on the whole smarter, more progressive,
more willing to deviate from form, and less rooted in the
overwrought demonstrations of rage and anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick for us,'' explains Spider, ``is to be aggressive and
heavy, but not brutal. Because I know how I feel when I hear a band
that's just so over the top it's just like beating me over the
skull with this sort of thing that's, like, fake. . . . I think
that most people's tortured-soul trip is so contrived it's
pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main goal . . . has always been to have the kind of band
that can go wherever we feel like it should go and not seem like an
uncomfortable shift in music. So on the next record, if we want to
get heavier, or we want to go back to more funky stuff, or
incorporate more rap like we used to do, nothing is going to stop
us. A lot of bands, for better or worse, paint themselves in a
corner. . . . I think if you set it up at the beginning as the type
of band where people don't know what to expect, but still stay
somewhat focused and have your sound. . . . I think people like
Nine Inch Nails can do that, have that industrial rock sound, but
take it wherever. People don't get freaked out because they expect
the change. That's the kind of band that we all wanna be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight the Stars Revolt!'' is nobody's idea of a soft album _
it's certainly riff-heavy _ but the band incorporated some spacy
interludes, emphasized melody more, and even ended the disc with a
Cars cover (``Good Times Roll'') and a jazzy selection (``Watch the
Sky for Me''). It's a multilayered disc, and not, as Spider says,
``the white boy rap/rock thing again. That was essentially what we
were doing, but I always saw the band as more than that.'' Indeed,
with the Cars cover and a certain robotic Devo-esque feel in
evidence, Spider says, laughing, ``we have always suffered from the
rap slash rock slash hard-core slash metal (tag) and I suppose now
they can add slash new wave and maybe even slash disco.
</P>
<P>
   As to the pop shift, Spider says, ``We realized that most of the
stuff that we listened to leaned almost to a poppier edge. Those
are the songs that we love and that everybody knows _ and you can
sing along to 'em. We wanted to try to do a little bit of that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `An evil word'
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spider, the group's lyricist and younger brother of Rob Zombie,
loves sci-fi and cartoon images. If he can raise the
phantasmagorical level in a song, he will do it. This time, there
may even be a concept behind this album.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every interview I have done,'' says Spider, ``I think the word
`concept album' comes up, so I am beginning to believe that maybe
it is one. It is such an evil word, because what is a concept
album? I think people equate it with sort of this '70s pretentious,
progressive rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason why it is focused like that is because it was the
first record we got to make in a relatively short period of time.
Everybody's head was sort of focused in the same place.'' That
place is not specifically the world of comic-book characters and
action figures, he says. Rather, the focus came about this way: ``I
started to get really into sort of a 1940s-'50s version of the
future. I thought it was really interesting how people's vision of
what tomorrow is supposed to be like has changed drastically. There
used to be a sense of hope and a positive outlook _ like technology
will prevail and we'll all be happy and the streets will be clean
and we'll all wear like matching jumpsuits. I thought what was
really interesting was how at a certain point in time that vision
of the future has become a `Bladerunner'-esque'/`Alien' thing,
overpopulated with death and destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you pick up those old 1940s magazines like `Amazing
Stories' there's this real sense of adventure _ that the one hero
with the laser gun is gonna save the world. And I just thought,
`What a refreshing outlook on things.' And so to me that was at
least the starting point of the inspiration for the record. It
doesn't really mean that all the songs are about that _ the concept
intrigued me.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not, then, reality-based rock. ``I keep saying, there are
so many bands now,'' says Spider, ``and their whole trip is `We're
keepin' it real,' and I think `Powerman 5000 is keeping it unreal.'
That's what rock's about, that's what entertainment's about, and .
. . it certainly keeps it much more interesting to me. I wouldn't
make the assumption that my life as it is is that interesting that
somebody would want to hear about it in a song.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Spider is not a fan of your-diary-as-your-art
songwriting. ``I don't even wanna hear my diary,'' he says, with a
laugh, ``so I would never make that assumption that other people
would.

THE CONTENDER 
Richard Nixon: The Congress Years 1946-1952 
By Irwin F. Gellman. Free Press. 590 pp. Illustrated. $30. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, Richard M. Nixon became the only man to
resign the presidency. Human nature being what it is, it's unlikely
Nixon will remain alone in presidential ignominy (lest we forget,
less than a year ago Bill Clinton came perilously close to joining
him). No, the single most extraordinary thing about Richard Nixon's
singularly extraordinary career isn't how he left public life but
the rapidity with which he rose in it. In slightly more than seven
years, he went from a lieutenant commander in the Navy to vice
president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The steps he took on that ascent are well documented: the upset
victory over a nationally known liberal Democrat, US Representative
Jerry Voorhis; the pivotal role in the Alger Hiss affair; the
bruising defeat of another nationally known liberal Democrat, US
Representative Helen Gahagan Douglas, to gain a US Senate seat in
1950; and the wheeling and dealing among the camps of Republican
presidential contenders Dwight Eisenhower, Robert Taft, and Earl
Warren that led to what would have seemed all but unthinkable six
months before: the spectacle of Nixon, not yet 40, poised to be a
heartbeat away from the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   It would be another 16 years, in their own way even more
improbable and event-filled than the preceding seven, before he
attained the White House _ but attain it he did. Even as they set
him on his way, those first seven years would set the pattern for
the rest of his career.
</P>
<P>
   From the very start, controversy surrounded him. This, too, has
been copiously _ and often tendentiously _ documented. Against
Voorhis, Nixon ran, if not a dirty campaign, then certainly one
that was far from pristine. On the other hand, Voorhis was
increasingly unpopular in his district, and 1946 was perhaps the
best possible year in this century to be running as a Republican.
Nixon won fair, if not altogether square.
</P>
<P>
   He clearly exploited the Hiss scandal for all its very
considerable political worth, and may or may not have been
previously tipped off to reports of Hiss's communist involvement.
But the fact remains that much of the bad odor surrounding Nixon's
conduct depends on the assumption of Hiss's innocence, an
assumption that long ago ceased to be tenable.
</P>
<P>
   The 1950 Senate campaign was famously mephitic _ but on both
sides. For all that Nixon stooped to calling Douglas ``pink right
down to her underwear,'' she popularized the name ``Tricky Dick''
and all but called him a fascist.
</P>
<P>
   As for the vice-presidential nomination, Nixon behaved with
breathtaking disingenuousness in the weeks leading up to the
convention, trying desperately to play each camp off against the
other for his own advantage. Even so, his selection as Eisenhower's
running mate was virtually ordained by political considerations.
Who better to stand alongside an elderly nominee, backed by the
Eastern wing of the party and presented as being explicitly ``above
politics,'' than a youngish Californian and famously ferocious
campaigner whose impeccable anticommunist credentials endeared him
to Midwestern hard-liners?
</P>
<P>
   The great fascination of Nixon's early career lies not in these
justly famed events but rather in what went on in between them. How
did this least clubbable of men navigate the dense thicket of
protocol and backslapping that is life in the House (the world's
largest Rotary meeting) and the Senate (the self-styled ``world's
most exclusive club'')? California elections, where personality and
advertising took precedence over party and organization, were a
kind of political laboratory for the rest of the nation. To what
extent was Nixon a creature, or creator, of Golden State-style
campaigning? A candidate who started out in politics professing
``practical liberalism'' _ a rubric that works as well as any,
actually, in describing the career of the man who gave us the
Environmental Protection Agency and peacetime wage-and-price
controls along with ``the Southern strategy'' and the White House
Plumbers _ how did his politics evolve and mesh with those of a
party that claimed Joseph McCarthy as well as Margaret Chase Smith?
</P>
<P>
   In describing public life, Nixon loved to cite Theodore
Roosevelt's image of ``the man in the arena.'' It's not the arena
but the man who usually gets attended to in studies of Nixon _ and
understandably so. During these seven years, though, it's the arena
_ the context in which he moved _ that's perhaps even more
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin F. Gellman thinks otherwise. The author of three books on
Franklin D. Roosevelt's foreign policy, he claims to have examined
``every catalogued item . . . covering Nixon's congressional
career'' at the presidential library in Yorba Linda, Calif. There
is no reason to doubt it. ``The Contender,'' the first volume of a
projected trilogy, offers an unrelenting parade of unmediated fact.
Gellman sees himself as presenting a revisionist view of this
period, showing us a Nixon more sinned against than sinning. ``His
political rise demonstrates that while he was not perfect, he was a
dedicated, efficient public servant. The time has come to let his
record, for good and ill, speak for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a valid, if simplistic, interpretation of these years,
and the aim expressed in the second sentence is laudable, but
Gellman's plodding presentation and predictable argumentation do
little to further either. Dedicated and efficient the young Nixon
surely was. But even as Gellman again and again demonstrates that
Nixon did not violate the letter of a given law, we see a man so
consumed by ambition _ and so caught up in a headlong rush of
events _ that he found himself unable to recognize the law's
spirit. Worse, as the contender moved on to ever-greater arenas,
the rules kept changing, too.

WRACK 
By James Bradley 
Holt. 340 pp. $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The search for the past, however illusory, is usually an
admirable pursuit for writers. When they reach for meaning in
yesterday, we call it literature; when they reach toward tomorrow,
we call it science fiction. We have Herodotus to thank for this, as
well as the detritus left by every century hence. As much as
Einstein might protest, what's already gone seems eminently more
concrete and knowable than what hasn't yet occurred.
</P>
<P>
   These mutable issues of time _ its promises, deceits, and
forever shifting sands _ are what consume Australian writer James
Bradley, providing the arc of his first novel as well as most of
its poetic ventures. Published in Australia in 1997, ``Wrack''
received a number of literary accolades (including a couple of
prizes) and the critical acclaim of the British and Australian
press. With its collusion between history and geography, its
mirrored cruelties of love and war, and its wounded, morphine-mad
witness, it will call to mind Canadian Michael Ondaatje's 1992
novel, ``The English Patient.'' Bradley's American publisher has
prepared us for this comparison with the insistence that the novel
is ``at once reminiscent of `The English Patient' and `Heart of
Darkness.' '' But the plot is so similar to Ondaatje's _ a pair of
lovers tending a dying man in a remote locale, with narrative
voices woven between past and present _ that ``Wrack'' can't help
feeling derivative. At the very least, it's difficult not to be
thinking of one while reading the other.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the sandy provinces of New South Wales, ``Wrack'' careers
between the maritime quests of 500 years ago and an archeological
dig of the present, and its most compelling story swings gracefully
between both tenses. Historian turned archeologist David Norfolk
has spent years searching for the remains of a ghostly Portuguese
ship, one he believes to have been commanded in the 15th century by
an explorer named de Cueva. Its remains, if discovered, could
explain the myths of the past (among them a lost land mass called
Java la Grande) and rewrite the white man's ``discovery'' of
Australia. Norfolk's pursuits are not without precedent: He has
pieced together a great deal of research, both evidentiary and
theoretical, from the 1930s, most of it the work of academic
mavericks who wound up discredited for their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   On his last leg of funding from the university, David and his
team uncover a corpse, probably secreted in the dunes some 50 years
ago, near the presumed site of the shipwreck. Their discovery leads
David to a meeting with a former lover, Claire, the physician now
in charge of the autopsy. However dismaying this find, it seems
irrelevant to David's mission until a detective on the case
mentions ``the old bloke down in the shack'' _ a hermit who has
been on the same beach for decades and who, according to local
lore, was once searching for a ship.
</P>
<P>
   What David unearths is the stuff of history as well as fiction,
and that intersection _ that pact of intrigue and regret _ is what
elevates ``Wrack'' to a tale of great pacing and emotional punch.
The old man turns out to be Kurt Seligman, once an assistant to the
renegade historian Fraser McDonald, who had believed in and sought
the lost Portuguese ship. Grotesquely maimed years earlier, now
dying from cancer, Kurt begins to reveal the long, bitter truth to
David _ aware that he has found a deathbed witness for his story,
and more than ready to pull him into the vortex of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Claire has begrudgingly joined David in caring for the dying
man; less invested in Kurt's mysteries, she is also less trusting
of him, and her wariness serves as a warning to the reader. But
Kurt sways us as well as his confidant, for his past is something
out of ``Casablanca'' _ a prewar tale of three lovers entwined,
with Fraser and Kurt both vying for an opera singer named Veronica.
The shards of this anguished recollection are delivered in Kurt's
own narrative voice, so that the reader is thrust among different
viewpoints (David's present, Kurt's past, Bradley's distanced
narrative about time and history) with riveting ease. By the end of
``Wrack,'' one is as consumed with the struggle for Kurt's soul _
with the ``facts'' and memories of his alliances and betrayals _ as
with the hidden shipwreck that has claimed a piece of everyone
here.
</P>
<P>
   You can sense Bradley's background as a poet in ``Wrack,'' which
has a lofty feel to its prose even when it's cast in somewhat
brittle machismo (all the lovers tend to talk like Hemingway's men
and women). While dialogue may not be Bradley's strength, he is
masterful at the occasionally lovely, terse description: Veronica
delivers a perfect soprano while David imagines ``her ribs a
cathedral of bone and air.'' And Bradley's own sojourns into time
and space _ into cartography, Euclidean geometry, the juncture
where memory meets want _ provide a well-plotted course for a story
that, in the end, is beholden to mystery itself.
</P>
<P>
   What James Bradley has set out to capture in this delicate novel
may be the same grail that so eluded and consumed his protagonist:
the etchings traced by human experience upon the map of history,
with one enhancing, rather than obscuring, the other. I do wish his
publisher had thought to illustrate with a map of Australia, or
Terra Australis, or Java la Grande. The novel begs for this blend
of artful myth and history, and such a guide would have made Kurt's
and David's passions seem more tangible, or at least more real. But
then ``real'' is a relative construct within the world of ``Wrack''
_ a place of dreams and landscapes constantly in motion, where even
love has a way of leaving before you see its face.

GEORGE BENJAMIN RETURNS TO TANGLEWOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENOX _ George Benjamin was born in 1960, and he has been an
internationally prominent composer for nearly half his life. He was
only 20 when the BBC Symphony Orchestra programmed his first major
orchestral piece, ``Ringed by the Flat Horizon,'' during the annual
Proms concerts in London's Royal Albert Hall.
</P>
<P>
   This summer Benjamin is one of the composers in residence at the
Tanglewood Music Center. Earlier this week he could be discovered
playing Frisbee in the lawn with some of the students, and he could
easily have been mistaken for one of them. Two of his remarkable
works were heard during the annual Tanglewood Festival of
Contemporary Music a week ago. Last weekend conductor Robert Spano
will lead soprano Dawn Upshaw and the Boston Symphony Orchestra in
a performance of Benjamin's ``A Mind of Winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Composed in 1981, this qualifies as an early work. ``I wrote it
while I was still studying at Cambridge University,'' Benjamin
says. ``I wrote it because I had fallen in love with the poem by
Wallace Stevens; the piece wasn't commissioned by or for anybody. I
wrote it because I had to. The poem has this metaphysical
description of a landscape with a snowman in it. The piece lasts
about nine minutes, and it is mostly quiet and meditative, but
there are also some places that pull out all of the stops. There is
a wind that blows through and across everything, and then
everything settles down again. The focus throughout is on the vocal
line. It was premiered at Benjamin Britten's Aldeburgh Festival,
but after Britten died.'' Benjamin talked about his life and music
over lunch in a Chinese restaurant near Tanglewood he was eager to
return to because he liked the spiced eggplant so much. He's a
cheerfully unpretentious, sunny person, with both the pixie humor
and the earthiness of Papageno in Mozart's ``The Magic Flute.''
</P>
<P>
   In his earlier youth, Benjamin was a pianist of virtuoso
standard, but he says he was composing from the moment he first sat
down at the keyboard. The piano was not his first instrument. He
began playing the recorder along with all the other children in
preschool; at age 5 his exceptional musical gift was already
apparent. The school music teacher, Miss Trury, was a pianist, and
encouraged him to start studying the instrument when he was 7.
``She was a bossy little lady, but a good and a demanding teacher.
As I learned to read music, I started scribbling down little pieces
of my own. By the time I was 13, it was time to move up one level,
so I went to Peter Gellhorn, a man of huge musical culture, a
wonderfully civilized man, who had been trained in Berlin before
World War II. He was my general music teacher _ piano, composition,
everything. Then when I was 16 he took me to Paris and turned me
over to Olivier Messiaen. I didn't realize then how extraordinarily
generous that was; teachers are usually possessive, aren't they? I
think Messiaen was intrigued by me because of this gesture of Peter
Gellhorn's.''
</P>
<P>
   Messiaen was one of the towering figures of 20th-century music,
and young Benjamin became a particular favorite of the old
master's; Benjamin also studied piano with Messiaen's wife, the
formidable Yvonne Loriod. ``Imagine what this was like for me. I
was still a schoolboy, writing incidental music for plays at
school. Messiaen had such sweetness, dignity, and courtesy; I was
his `Benjamin,' his baby one. He never told anyone to do anything _
you didn't even have to go to class, which he held three times a
week, four or five hours a session. He would analyze music of the
past or his own music, or talk about subjects that interested him,
like rhythm, or color, or birdsong. It was an enthralling time.''
</P>
<P>
   While studying with Messiaen, Benjamin lived with a series of
French families. ``They kept throwing me out because I was
composing my piano sonata at the instrument, and no one could stand
it.'' He made quite an impression when he would perform his sonata.
``I broke strings every time I played it, and in Paris a key flew
right off the piano and into the audience. I don't play it anymore,
and I don't even like it very much, but (British pianist) Peter
Donohoe still plays it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ringed by the Flat Horizon'' is the principal work Benjamin
composed while working with Messiaen. ``Every time I had a new 10
pages, I would take them to the class, much to the annoyance of my
fellow students. It was first performed by the student orchestra at
Cambridge, and then the conductor, Mark Elder, took it down to the
Proms, and that gave me a push.''
</P>
<P>
   Hailed as a genius and the bright hope of British music at 20,
Benjamin wisely followed his own course and did not pour out a
series of sequels to ``Ringed by the Flat Horizon.'' He stayed in
school, at Cambridge University, where his final teacher was
Alexander Goehr, a composer of considerable distinction who has
served as mentor to several generations of prominent British
composers and whose impact on Benjamin was ``considerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the two decades of Benjamin's prominence, his list of
compositions, like that of Henri Dutilleux in France, has not grown
long. Benjamin is a fastidious craftsman, and his works are
notable, among other things, for attention to detail. ``Well, I
haven't written that little,'' Benjamin says; he's probably heard
more criticism of his perfectionism than he needs to. ``After all,
there are eight or nine orchestral pieces _ and it could have been
only five! It is true that I am a very slow composer, or, to put it
better, I'm slow to start; starting is the slow bit. The first
measure is the most important because everything else is implicit
in it, so it can take me up to a year to find the beginning. But
once I've done that, then everything moves quite fast; most of my
pieces have been finished within two weeks. The process is about
failing and failing and failing until I discover what I'm doing.
I'm particularly careful about the harmonic side _ I like
complexity, but the kind that doesn't necessarily show itself. I
like the kind of powerful harmony that spreads itself across a
whole piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Benjamin no longer puts himself forward as a pianist,
he did astonish a late-night Tanglewood audience with his
improvised accompaniment to Fritz Lang's classic silent film
``Metropolis.'' His preferred medium of performance these days is
conducting, and though he has been highly successful, the art and
skill of conducting still fascinate him. He's been sitting in on
Robert Spano's conducting classes at Tanglewood, and this summer he
has become a particular admirer of the physical specificity and
emotional suggestiveness of Seiji Ozawa's rehearsals and
performances. Benjamin conducted his own pieces during the
contemporary music festival and volunteers that Seiji Ozawa Hall is
the most beautiful space he has ever performed in.

   Lessons of conducting
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some composers have found that conducting interfered with the
amount of time that composition takes _ Pierre Boulez is the most
prominent contemporary example. Benjamin believes that conducting
has helped his composing: ``Conducting helps me learn new things
about other music, about my own music, and about myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently Benjamin advised the BBC on 500 broadcasts surveying
the music of the 20th century; he also conducted his first opera,
Debussy's ``Pelleas et Melisande,'' at the Theatre de la Monnaie in
Brussels, with Jose van Dam as Golaud. Asked if he plans to compose
an opera himself, Benjamin responds with a question: ``Who knows?''
Then he says he will do no further conducting for the next six
months because he needs to write a piece commissioned for Boulez
and the London Symphony Orchestra; he also owes one to the Berlin
Philharmonic. ``But one piece a year is all I aspire to,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin's music has the sensuousness of surface and
intellectual rigor one would expect from a composer with his
background, and he is unapologetic about it. `` `Accessibility' is
an awful word, isn't it? Some of the `accessible' music being
written today is music no one really likes or no one really needs;
it is based on a vague idea of what people who don't like music
might like if they liked music. There is no potential for tears, or
for anything glorious. It is terribly sad when someone with an
original talent gets derailed by the need to be accessible. We need
a system which allows, encourages, demands composers to be
courageous _ and with all the supporting systems in place as well.
We need an intelligentsia to listen to and support new work, and to
argue about it at the very highest standard. I believe in elitism,
not as a matter of class or of wealth, but as a matter of quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I am not as pessimistic about the situation of music as
some people are. There are always young people who are willing to
play new music _ there are lots of them here at Tanglewoood _ and
there are always composers who are passionate about the things they
have to say.''

GOP'S GREEDY TAX-CUT PLAN IS MORE GOOD NEWS FOR CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans really outdid themselves this time.
The 10-year, $792 billion tax cut bill they passed last week is so
bad for the majority of Americans that criticism of it can hardly
be overstated.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the GOP has accomplished two results with this bill. It
has managed to insult the intelligence of millions of Americans who
know the tax cut is not for them.
</P>
<P>
   And it hands President Clinton another victory when he keeps his
promise and vetoes the unpopular bill. That will only add to his
political strength as he campaigns for Vice President Al Gore to
succeed him and for other Democrats seeking congressional seats.
</P>
<P>
   The question might be asked about the GOP bill: ``Just how bad
is it?'' It's so bad it's rightfully called a tax cut for the
wealthy. And the higher the taxpayer's salary, the more the
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Based on research from the Citizens for Tax Justice, an
independent tax foundation in Washington, and from the Clinton
administration's Office of Management and Budget, the tax cut isn't
so good for working families struggling to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, 20 percent of the nation's taxpayers, including
members of Congress, would reap 82 percent of all the benefits. The
remaining 80 percent of taxpayers would reap only 18 percent of the
tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   The richest, the 1 percent who earn more than $300,000 a year,
would receive 42 percent of the tax benefits under the bill. Their
average cut would be $46,000 a year. In contrast, working men and
women would receive an average savings of only $138 a year, less
than 40 cents a day.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cut bill would devastate domestic programs _ from Head
Start to medical research to law enforcement _ that are both
important and necessary to millions of working families.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining the same level of funding for these programs over
the next 10 years would require $595 billion additional real
dollars to cover inflation. With the GOP tax cut bill, that money
woiuld no longer be there, and the programs would suffer at least a
38 percent cut in funding.
</P>
<P>
   This would mean, for example, that 6.5 million fewer children
would be served by the Title I education program, with 140,000
fewer biomedical research grants, 6,300 fewer FBI agents and
100,000 fewer local police.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans estimate the budget surplus is $964
billion, but that amount includes the $595 billion needed to fund
the domestic programs at the same level during the decade of the
tax cut. That leaves a real surplus of only $370 billion, which is
far less than the $792 billion bill.
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton has stressed, the nation would be better
served if the budget surplus was geared toward protecting Medicare
and Social Security. Clinton and other Democrats are willing to
have a limited tax cut, but only after there is fiscal assurance
that those major programs are protected.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP cut would put the Republicans' own interest, if not
special interests, before the people's interest.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare has severe funding problems, and if additional
resources are not forthcoming, the program is likely to become
insolvent, broke, in the next 15 years. Under Clinton and the
Democrats, the projected surpluses would be used to extend the
healthy life of the program as well as to pay for prescriptions and
other drug benefits for senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security could face similar trouble under the GOP bill.
Currently, the program has enough resources to continue through
2035, but a shortfall is predicted after that. The Democrats would
use the surplus to help keep Social Security going strong far
beyond 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   During the current recess, House and Senate Republicans are
hitting the trail to persuade voters to support the bill before
they put it on Clinton's desk early next month. But the fact that
the Republicans still think they can persuade the majority to
support a bill for the rich shows just how much out of touch the
GOP still is with the country.
</P>
<P>
   And since the media has gone to town outlining who actually
would benefit most from these cuts, the chances are slim and
slimmer that the GOP could muster enough national support to
persuade Clinton to rescind his promise or even override his
expected veto of the tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats point out that the bill includes $60 billion worth of
tax breaks sought by lobbyists. For example, business and
restaurant lobbyists would gain an increase in their deductions,
from 50 to 60 percent, at a cost of $3.8 billion. And
manufacturers, including Silicon Valley firms, would receive a
five-year extension of their research and development tax credits,
worth more than $13 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Republicans decided to give a little more to the
average American to get the bill passed, their arguments still
would not be persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   The average American _ not in the 1 percent or even 20 percent
income bracket _ knows that maintaining important domestic programs
and keeping Medicare and Social Security fiscally solvent are far
more important goals than a tax cut that could bankrupt their
futures.

PRE-PAID CELLPHONE CARDS STARTING TO CONNECT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN AND BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We thought we'd discovered all the good cellular phone deals
until we got an e-mail last week from Tom Metro, a computer
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   He asked us why we never wrote about pre-paid cell phone cards
as a low-cost way for skeptics to try wireless phone service. Metro
had been shopping around for a plan for his elderly mother, who
wants a cell phone for emergencies only. He found a Cellular One
pre-paid analog plan for $90 that includes 120 minutes and lasts an
entire year.
</P>
<P>
   Though the cost for each minute is a hefty 75 cents, this plan's
one-year $90 cost compares favorably to most standard monthly plans
that cost at least $200 a year. And the offer lasts a year, while
most pre-paid minutes expire in 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   With analog handsets so cheap these days (maybe even free if you
can find someone who has abandoned an analog handset after
converting to a digital phone), this pre-paid option struck Metro
as a smart solution for a safety-oriented user.
</P>
<P>
   He's right. And he's also onto a new trend in the wireless
world: promoting pre-paid cards not only to serve those who don't
financially qualify for standard contracts, but to first-timers or
transient folks who don't want big commitments or monthly bills.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless analysts say companies in New York, Miami, and
Philadelphia have already slashed prices on pre-paid cards and
sweetened the terms to attract a wide mix of consumers. Some
discount resellers are getting into the act there as well.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, the pre-paid cellular phone market is just starting
to heat up. AT&AMP;T Wireless has yet to offer any pre-paid cards here,
but other major carriers have begun lowering prices and tinkering
with terms of their pre-paid cards.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Thigpen, vice president and general manager of pre-paid
services for Boston Communications Group in Woburn, Mass., which
runs pre-paid card systems for carriers, said Boston lags behind
other cities in this niche market. But he sees signs that carriers
view these cards as ways to draw in first-time users, as well as
teenagers, college students, or temporary residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're extending beyond the credit-challenged,'' he said,
using a phrase frequently heard in the industry to describe people
with nonexistent or bad credit histories that disqualify them for
standard contracts.
</P>
<P>
   If you use a cell phone with any regularity you're far better
off going with a standard contract, assuming you qualify. Permanent
charges on standard plans are as low as a dime or a quarter a
minute.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, the most aggressive pre-paid seller is Omnipoint, and
roughly half its customers are pre-paid users. This company's $50
pre-paid card buys 125 minutes, for instance. It comes to 40 cents
a minute, the lowest pre-paid price in the Boston market. Minutes
expire in 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint PCS revamped its pre-paid offerings this past May,
promoting lower per-minute prices and no expiration dates. But
there's two negative surprises in the package: There's a $125
activation fee and you must pay a 50-cent daily maintenance charge
on top of your usage, which amounts to a $15 monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Duncan, marketing manager for Sprint PCS in New England,
said the company is trying to turn its ``credit-challenged''
customers in another direction, to its ``Account Spending Limit''
program that puts a spending lid on an account. In this way, people
can go with cheaper per-minute standard contracts.
</P>
<P>
   If you must buy your own handset, keep in mind that analog ones
may become defunct in a year or so as the entire cellular world
goes digital. Don't pay a lot for an analog phone if you have to
buy one.
</P>
<P>
   While a Yankee Group study finds that prepaid accounts represent
about 4 percent of wireless subscribers, analysts predict more
people will flock to this option as prices drop and expiration
dates become more distant. That's likely to bring in many who might
now be on the sidelines, turned off by the upfront costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies are starting to focus more on the neophytes and
skeptics,'' said Lowenstein of the Yankee Group.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
E-commerce and sales tax
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the growth of Internet buying, we've gotten more questions
about when buyers have to pay Massachusetts sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   State revenue officials say Internet purchases are viewed the
same as mail-order buys. If the company selling the product has ``a
physical presence in Massachusetts'' _ such as a retail store,
warehouse, phone banks or sales offices _ it must collect sales tax
from the buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this covers only ``taxable items'' as defined by this
state. So if you buy a $50 sweater on-line from the Gap clothing
store, which has a physical presence here, the store can't collect
sales tax because a clothing item under $175 is not taxable.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown, associate general counsel for the state Department
of Revenue, said shipping and handling charges are generally
considered exempt from sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   Now get this: The law goes further to say that if the company
does not have a physical presence here and you buy a taxable item
from them, such as a computer, it is your responsibility to send in
the appropriate sales tax amount to the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   (State revenue officials say this is a ``tough tax to
collect.'')
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Odds &AMP; Ends
</P>
<P>
   --Cell phones and 911: If you have a spare cell phone, keep in
mind that Federal Communications Commission rules require carriers
to put through any 911 emergency call on any handset. That includes
handsets that no longer have an active service contract. That means
if you had an old analog phone with Cellular One, but let the
service contract lapse, you can still use that phone for 911 calls.
Cellular One has to put through the call, at its own expense. So
spare cell phones, which might now be used as a child's toy, might
be better off charged-up and in a car's glove compartment.
</P>
<P>
   --Minimum purchases on credit cards? A reader recently asked if
merchants are allowed to set minimum purchase requirements when
using a Visa card. She recently wanted to charge $5 in gasoline.
She said the clerk insisted on an $8 minimum for credit card
purchases. The clerk also offered to charge $8, then return $3 back
in cash. There's no state or federal law on the subject, but Visa
regulations prohibit merchants from setting minimum purchase
requirements or giving cash back. If such violations are brought to
Visa's attention, their contract can be terminated. Said a Visa
spokeswoman: ``Technically, you can charge a pack of gum.''

   RUSSIA-YELTSIN _ MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin thrust Russia
into yet another political crisis on Monday by firing of the prime
minister he appointed only three months ago and replacing him with

president. Sergei Stepashin, appointed in May, became the fourth
prime minister sacked by Yeltsin in the past 18 months.

Jordan and Syria have made Wednesday a holiday so people don't have
to be outside. So has the Palestinian Authority, which is warning
people to be inside so they don't hurt their eyes. An
over-reaction? Maybe. But it is a way of protecting people who
don't understand the risks. The Israeli Likud Party is holding a
rally in the Golan Heights, where a lot of people are going to look
at the eclipse, and using it to kick of a campaign to keep the
Golan. DEVELOPING. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

 &HT;    Executive pushes new concepts, expansion in other countries.
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Maybe Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox should've kept
Arthur Blank on the mound this season.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot's chief executive officer threw out the first pitch
July 28, just before the night quickly turned into a 10-4 Braves
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Blank's ceremonial toss was a little high but not far off the
mark. Pretty decent for a guy throwing with a toddler on his hip.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't bad, huh?'' said a smiling Blank as he returned to
his seat with his 2 1/2-year-old son, Joshua.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt Blank has collected plenty of wins at Home
Depot. In his third year as chief executive of the world's largest
home improvement retailer, he's aiming at more targets than ever in
the company's 20-year history.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution during the
baseball game, Blank explained how his job is changing as the
company charts new territory, and how he's building the troops to
keep up. The strategy is designed to keep the bottom line solid and
Wall Street happy.
</P>
<P>
   New generation
</P>
<P>
   Chairman and co-founder Bernie Marcus bequeathed the CEO post to
Blank in 1997, following nearly two decades of incredible growth.
Revenue climbed from $7 million in 1979 to more than $30 billion
today.
</P>
<P>
   In the past several years, Home Depot has evolved from its
scrappy built-from-scratch roots, and the job of the CEO has
matured along with it, Blank said.
</P>
<P>
   Before taking on the new title, Blank was known as the
numbers-crunching president who kept the bottom line lean. Now he's
showing off his visionary side.
</P>
<P>
   ``My role is certainly very different than Bernie's was in the
earlier days of our company,'' Blank said. ``Back then, we were
just trying to open the stores. Now the role is much more complex
because we're thinking about how to drive deeper into the industry
and how to serve customers differently in other segments of the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming CEO, he has taken a swing at several new areas
outside the company's foolproof retail warehouse domain, including
a new-and-improved Expo Design Center, the first Home Depot outside
North America and the brand-new Villager's Hardware retail concept.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the company isn't still busy peppering the landscape
with its bread-
</P>
<P>
   and-butter warehouse stores. Now at roughly 800 locations, Home
Depot plans to have 1,600 by the end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Blank leaves the logistics of day-to-day
operations to his tactical team.
</P>
<P>
   Pausing to check out a perfect bunt by the Brewers, he explained
he spends most of his time plotting growth opportunities 15 years
down the road.
</P>
<P>
   As the company prepares to double in size, he also has to find
the talent to support that growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a lot of boundless thinking to make sure that people are
moved around regardless of divisions and to find the best available
person to attack an issue,'' Blank said. ``We don't restrict our
promotions by divisions. We look at the whole company and find the
best person.''
</P>
<P>
   Blank has shown he's willing to look beyond the home team if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1998, as the company embarked on an international
expansion and a national rollout of the Expo stores, he hired
outsiders to fill two high-ranking posts:
</P>
<P>
   -- David Suliteanu, a former vice chairman of Macy's East, was
put in the newly created position of group president of diversified
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   -- Dennis Carey, a former vice president of AT&AMP;T with
international experience, became the new chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   It was not an easy time for the Home Depot veterans who were
passed over for the new positions, Blank recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people moved from center field to left field to nurture
the standards of our core business, while the other areas of growth
got new support,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's to our senior managers' credit that they looked at
these (outside) folks and realized they have certain backgrounds
and expertise ... that some of our folks just didn't have.''
</P>
<P>
   Hotshot or not, all recruits put on an apron for a baptism that
begins in the aisles of Big Orange. It's a training tradition the
company will likely never get rid of.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Marcus, still very active in training at age 70,
conducts about eight ``Bernie Road Shows'' a year at the company's
stores. Home Depot also requires its board members to visit stores
frequently and interview employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always believed that the culture of our company and the
essence of our truth is in the stores,'' said Blank, who visits
about 100 stores a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sets an important role model for our management to see the
president and CEO is visiting the stores, especially for the people
we bring into the company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Blank is well-suited for the store walks. Athletic and
competitive, he said he likes to be where the action is. As a high
school baseball player, Blank relished being catcher because he
could be in the middle of every play.
</P>
<P>
   At last week's sweltering game, Blank and his family passed up
the luxury suites to eat hot dogs and peanuts in the stands with
the rest of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he has been grooming the next generation of leaders,
Blank indicated he has plenty of years left at Home Depot's
headquarters in Vinings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no clock ticking. I'm relatively young (56), and I
have a very good balance in my life,'' the CEO said. ``The board is
very supportive, and my wife, Stephanie, is very supportive. As
long as I have that balance and I'm having fun, there's no reason
not to keep doing what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing new concepts
</P>
<P>
   Blank has his hands full steering Home Depot in new directions.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the long-term growth strategy is the rollout of
its upscale Expo stores. The five-year plan calls for 200 Expos
nationally. The division will end this year with 15 stores, and the
company plans to double its size next year. Metro Atlanta, which
has one store, will soon get two more Expos.
</P>
<P>
   Blank is confident that consumers will continue to be able to
afford $6,000 refrigerators, $16,000 Oriental rugs and other pricey
items aimed at home designers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to see a recession, at least not across the
entire country. We may see something regional, but even so, we're
an international company, so we are supported in other areas,''
Blank said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, every Expo decision is made on a long-term basis. If the
economy gets hit for six months, or even a year, it won't make a
long-term difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Blank and Marcus have always had a careful, methodical strategy,
often testing a new idea for years before taking the concept
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Expo was nearly 10 years in the making. Also, while other
retailers are leaping into cyberspace, the company is showing its
trademark caution in opening an Internet site for sales.
</P>
<P>
   Another long-range venture is Villager's Hardware, a new
convenience home-repair concept that just debuted in New Jersey.
Early sales are running ahead of expectations, but it will be in
the test mode for an unspecified time, Blank noted.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts generally have favored all of the growth plans, but
they're especially eager about Home Depot's ``pro initiative.'' The
company has been testing ways to aggressively court small
contractors, plumbers, electricians and other commercial customers
because they represent a big opportunity in repeat business.
</P>
<P>
   These small professionals spend about $215 billion a year for
supplies. Currently, however, they represent only 20 percent to 30
percent of Home Depot's sales. ``The pro business will probably
influence sales and profitability more than any of the other
initiatives,'' said analyst Dan Wewer of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, Arthur is really pushing the needle on growth,''
Wewer added. ``He has been a much more aggressive CEO than
Bernie.''
</P>
<P>
   Competing globally
</P>
<P>
   As the Braves fought for their first run of the evening, Blank
talked about one of his biggest challenges: How do you spread the
do-it-yourself fever overseas?
</P>
<P>
   With Canada under its belt, Home Depot has looked at other
countries from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the retailier made its first farflung effort with a
store in Santiago, Chile. The move into Latin America continues
next year with more stores in Chile and new locations in Buenos
Aires, Argentina. Next on the map could be China or England,
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Home Depot announced it had hired Swedish executive
Anders Moberg to run its international operations. Moberg, former
president of home furnishings company Ikea Group, starts his global
tasks this month.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Blank's choice was a big clue that the
globe-trotting could begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``International growth is going to be very important in the next
five to 15 years,'' Blank said. ``We'll be planting seeds in the
next five years, maybe in the Far East, or it could be in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Blank has said repeatedly he won't expand globally just for the
sake of collecting flags. ``There are challenges in all of our
growth initiatives, but the international realm is the most complex
because of real estate and the logistics of the supply chain.
Obviously, there are language and cultural differences to overcome,
too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the bottom line
</P>
<P>
   Even as the company finds new ways to sell home improvement _
whether it's through new store concepts, over the Internet or
overseas _ the expanding base of Home Depot stores will continue to
drive earnings, Blank said.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the booming construction market and consumers who are
nuts about remodeling, Home Depot posted a 45 percent increase in
first-quarter profit. The second-quarter earnings report comes out
Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   But the strong growth sets the bar increasingly higher for the
company on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with Wall Street is that it's a
what-have-you-done-for-me-lately kind of business,'' said analyst
Wayne Hood of Prudential Securities in Atlanta. Hood has dropped
his rating on the stock to a ``hold'' because he sees more
potential for a rise in interest rates, which would likely slow
housing sales.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Wewer points out that Home Depot has met its overall
goal of 21 percent to 22 percent growth a year. ``And I don't see
any problem with keeping up that kind of growth for the next five
years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Home Depot had a per-share profit of $1.06. This year
the retailer is expected to earn $1.38 a share, according to a
survey by IBES International.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot's stock, meanwhile, has risen 50 percent in the past
12 months. The stock closed Friday down 37 1/2 cents to $63.81 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer or be hammered
</P>
<P>
   As far as the industry outlook, there's market share to pick up
as Home Depot and Lowe's Home Improvement Warehouse, the distant
No. 2, continue to knock off the competition.
</P>
<P>
   While the No. 3 chain, Menard, has hung on with solid regional
growth in the Midwest, some other chains are downsizing. Hechinger,
the country's fourth-largest chain, has steadily shut stores that
overlap with Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot currently has about 18 percent of the $172 billion
home improvement market, and it could grow to 33 percent by 2003,
Wewer said. He estimates Lowe's will have as much as 13 percent
market share in that time.
</P>
<P>
   But even though Home Depot has lapped the competition several
times over, there's no room for coasting, Blank insisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a poster of a lion and a gazelle outside my conference
room,'' Blank said as it became apparent that the Braves would lose
to the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gazelle has to get up in the morning and get running or
else it'll get eaten. The lion has to get up and get running, too,
or else it doesn't eat,'' Blank said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you're a lion or a gazelle, you've got to get up and
get running. You don't walk. You don't trot. You run.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's the philosophy of our company.''

SOME PEOPLE IN TV ARE TALKING ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ A couple of weeks ago, while rehearsing a
shootout scene for an episode of CBS's ``Martial Law,'' Arsenio
Hall asked his director to change the scene so his cop character
would stop the bad guy with a single shot rather than a fusillade
of bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Not long before, Hall had recoiled when he was shown publicity
photos displaying him in dramatic gun-wielding poses. ``Throw those
away,'' he ordered his publicist.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times we get requests from kids for photos,'' Hall
explained. ``I can't send these pictures out of me with Berettas.''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the Columbine High School massacre, which
put a harrowing exclamation point on a string of other school
shootings in the past two years, a rethinking of violence has
quietly threaded its way into decisions being made each day in the
conference rooms and on the sets where TV shows are created.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say the upcoming fall season will not contain its
share of gunfire and gore, nor to say that everyone in the TV
industry accepts the notion of a causal link between small-screen
violence and the real-life kind. The prospect of censorship repels
many, who say the lion's share of the blame belongs with gun
manufacturers and their allies in Congress, not with Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   But some who create the images that stream into the nation's 99
million TV homes _ especially those, like Hall, whose shows are
popular with young viewers _ say there is much more soul-searching
now about the possible effects of those images. ``It comes into my
life constantly,'' Hall said somberly.
</P>
<P>
   That theme echoed through numerous interviews with TV producers,
performers, and scriptwriters _ and, in some cases, words have been
backed up by action. On several programs slated to air this fall,
violent scenes are being reduced or rewritten so the bloodshed
occurs off-screen. On others, the story lines have shifted to
emphasize the consequences of violence, or to make the programs
``character-based'' rather than mayhem-based.
</P>
<P>
   At the WB network, whose primary audience is teenagers,
executives have urged producers of individual shows to explore
Columbine-linked themes like teen alienation. ``Does Columbine wake
you up a little bit? Yes,'' said WB president Jamie Kellner, though
he contended the network has always tried to treat violence
responsibly.
</P>
<P>
   Even Dick Van Dyke, whose ``Diagnosis Murder'' appeals primarily
to older viewers, took his writers and producers out to lunch a few
weeks after Columbine and laid down the law, saying, ``There will
be no AK-47s, no mass killings'' on the program, according to
supervising producer Steve Brown. Producers of the new mob drama
``Falcone'' promise that a graphic ice-pick murder seen in the
pilot episode will be reedited so the scene focuses on the reaction
of witnesses rather than the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's changing,'' remarked actress Christine Lahti, who
starred in ``Chicago Hope'' for five years. ``I think that people _
writers, producers, directors, and actors _ are feeling a kind of
accountability, that there shouldn't be so much violence on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Meryl Marshall, president of the Academy of Television Arts &AMP;
Sciences, said the TV industry is becoming more receptive to the
program ratings system and the content-blocking V-chip, both
designed to keep children from seeing violence (or sex or
profanity) on TV. ``The Hollywood community is focusing on its
responsibilities,'' said Marshall.``There's a consciousness about
their role, and the consequences, that's been heightened.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A new stigma
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If lurid violence was once seen as adding an edge, it now is
viewed as possibly adding a stigma, at least for the time being. TV
writers and producers, many of them parents themselves, say they
had a visceral response to the shootings at Columbine and five
other high schools since 1997. (So did network executives: Kellner
delayed airing the finale of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' because
it involved violence at a high school graduation, and CBS president
Leslie Moonves decided not to put ``Falcone'' on the fall schedule
because its violence was jolting when seen just after Columbine.
However, it is now slated for midseason.)
</P>
<P>
   But there is another, more basic reason, articulated by writer
Terry Curtis Fox, who admits he has written his share of scenes
involving violence: ``I want there to be shows for my kid to
watch.'' Fox said those who work in television have gotten the
message loud and clear that ``parents are really, really upset.''
</P>
<P>
   But will the TV industry's concerns about violence last when
political pressure and public outrage begin to abate, or if lower
body counts turn out to mean lower ratings? There is ample reason
for doubt.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, some vehemently contend the medium is being
scapegoated, along with movies and video games, for violence that
should be blamed on the proliferation of guns and the failure by
many parents to act parental. Calls for restraint on TV violence
awaken deeply held fears about censorship, even among those who are
not fans of bloody fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there's too much violence depicted, and yes, people use
violence cheaply and exploitively,'' said ``ER'' star Anthony
Edwards. ``But that's the flip side of our freedom to express
yourself. People have the right to turn their computers off and
turn their TVs off, be responsible parents, act like adults. We act
like children in this country. We point fingers at everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   That line of reasoning rings a bit hollow to writer-producer
David E. Kelley of ``The Practice,'' ``Ally McBeal,'' and
``Snoops.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Producers have to be cognizant of the fact that what they do
is seen by millions of people,'' said Kelley. ``It's a nice little
idea to say, well, `Parents should supervise what their kids
watch,' but the reality is that they don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always wary of condoning any kind of censorship, but I'm
just as wary of stapling `Censorship' to a flag and then wagging it
over your head as an automatic license to do whatever you want,''
added Kelley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where the line is drawn, but I certainly don't
think producers should be saying `Responsibility? It's not up to
me. I'll just be an artist and put the images up that I want and if
people get hurt, well, that's the price of a free society.' I think
that's just a little too glib and irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Many feel as Kelley does, and their views are buttressed by
studies, sponsored by the American Medical Association and the
American Psychological Association, that have found a link between
youthful aggression and violence on TV and in the movies. It seems
likely, however, that some of television's other talented
writer-producers, who specialize in pushing the outside of the
thematic envelope, will continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Three such producers interviewed by the Globe _ Chris Carter of
``The X-Files,'' Steven Bochco of ``NYPD Blue,'' and David Chase of
``The Sopranos'' _ are clearly unshaken in their conviction that,
in Bochco's words, ``an artist's responsibility is to his art or
her art,'' and not to gauging the possible societal effects of that
art.
</P>
<P>
   While saying he is ``very conscious that you can't scream `Fire'
in a crowded theater,'' Bochco said his ``deepest belief is that
the overwhelming majority of Americans are not violent, are not
psychotic, see entertainment for what it is, and understand they
have choices about what they watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read about a tragedy like Columbine, that's not the
fault of television or the movies or Sunday-afternoon football,''
he added. ``That's probably the fault of a mental disease. . . . I
have such contempt for politicians who saddle us up to ride us for
political ends.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Standards unchanged
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carter, whose new ``Harsh Realm'' for Fox is among the more
violent new shows this fall, said that ``for me, Columbine didn't
change anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal standards are the same, which is to be a
responsible storyteller, to use the elements and conventions of
storytelling that provide the best story, and not to water anything
down, not to shrink from anything, and to try to deliver the most
powerful message, to entertain, and to edify whenever possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase, whose ``The Sopranos'' was the TV event of last season,
does not rule out a link between entertainment and violence _ just
not the link many others suppose. ``People alway say, `Oh, the
violence in television, the violence in movies causes violence.'
What about the rest of our entertainment, which is so bland, so
soulless, embraces horrible values of consumerism and fake
happinesss. . . . All those lies that everybody's fed, what about
that?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was a 15-year-old kid and I watched some of the crap
that's around, I'd go crazy too. I really would. So much of it is
so at odds with what you're feeling in your own life.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the best dramas on TV _ ``Law &AMP; Order,'' ``The
Practice,'' ``ER'' _ do not traffic in gratuitous violence.
Concerns about violence on TV could stem partly from changes in the
medium itself. ``Network television has gotten a bad rap, lumped in
with what people can see on cable from motion pictures,'' said John
Wells, executive producer of ``ER.'' ``As the conduit into the home
has changed, you don't really distinguish between what's on NBC and
what's on Showtime or HBO.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of other parents, filmmaker Martha Coolidge had to
cope with heart-rending fallout in her own home from the Columbine
High School massacre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mommy, I'm scared to go to school,'' Coolidge's 10-year-old
son told her in late April, shortly after gunshots claimed more
than a dozen young lives in Littleton, Colo. ``Is somebody going to
come in and shoot me?''
</P>
<P>
   Coolidge, the director of numerous television and feature films,
including the upcoming ``Introducing Dorothy Dandridge'' for HBO,
is no friend of censorship. Indeed, she has often fought for
artistic freedom as cochair of the Directors Guild of America's
creative rights committee, and she does not want concerns over
violence to lead to outside ``controls over what we see.''
</P>
<P>
   But she is also no friend of what she calls ``exploitive
violence'' on TV or in films, voicing dismay that ``it is
everywhere, everywhere in our culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The creative community is living in this country too,'' said
Coolidge. ``Everybody needs to take responsibility for what is
going on in our country.''

   SURPLUS-PARTIES (Washington) _ The heated battle over how to use
projected federal budget surpluses has exposed deep rifts between
the two parties, both in political and economic terms. Most of the
fight is over the portion of the surplus generated by general tax
revenues, $996 billion. Republicans say the figure is so big that
the country can afford a $792 billion tax cut and still find plenty
of money for needs like adding a prescription drug benefit to
Medicare and increasing spending on the military. But Democrats
argue that the surplus projections are based on a series of
questionable premises: that the economy will avoid a protracted
downturn; that unexplained surges in revenue will continue, and
that the forecasting ability of budget analysts will prove far more
accurate than it has in the past. The biggest problem with the
projections, Democrats say, is that they assume an unrealistically
low level of increases in government spending. By Richard W.
Stevenson.

BRITISH UPPER LIPS QUIVER AS AMERICANS BUY UP THEATERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It there's one thing that drives many Brits crazy, it's
the idea of Americans messing with their culture.
</P>
<P>
   So one might imagine the moans a few days ago when news emerged
that the American conglomerate SFX Entertainment had spent $250
million to buy the Apollo Group, which owns 10 of the most famous
theaters in London's West End, including the Lyceum and the
Dominion. To make matters worse, SFX, which also bought Boston's
Don Law Co., may snap up the Stoll Moss chain of theaters, which is
on the market for $160 million and which includes prestigious
venues such as the Garrick, the Palladium, and the Theatre Royal
Drury Lane.
</P>
<P>
   This followed a decision by the Royal Opera House, which hired
an American director last year in a desperate move to end its
financial troubles, to let the name of some rich American patron be
stamped on the front of its building in exchange for a $16 million
donation.
</P>
<P>
   It would mark the first time any one of Britain's four national
arts companies _ the Royal Opera, the English National Opera, the
Royal National Theatre, and the Royal Shakespeare Company _ has
allowed someone's name to be displayed on its building.
</P>
<P>
   While some in the arts community were quick to sniff at the idea
of the Royal Opera putting its prestige up for sale, Lucinda
Morrison, a spokeswoman for the National Theatre, was less
judgmental.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone offered us 10 million pounds, we'd consider it,''
she said. ``There is a sensitivity, especially in the national
theaters because they are just that, national theaters. But things
are moving that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutbacks in arts funding, which began under Margaret Thatcher
and have been alleviated only mildly under the ``Cool Britannia''
ideology of Prime Minister Tony Blair, have left the purveyors of
higher culture looking for money wherever they can. At the National
Theatre, the $17 million public grant held steady for five years
until it got a boost of $1.6 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the idea of Americans owning nearly all of the West End
or their money being needed to rescue the Royal Opera unsettles
many. Raymond Gubbay, a classical music promoter, described the
Royal Opera's fund-raising gambit as ``a rather tacky American
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   While news of the sell-off of West End theaters and the naming
rights to the Royal Opera House has broken in the same week, the
circumstances surrounding the two are considerably different. The
Royal Opera has been forced to cancel its performances this year as
it gets its financial house in order.
</P>
<P>
   But the West End and most of its 50 theaters have been having a
good run. The theaters employ about 27,000 people and sell more
than 11 million tickets a year. The theaters are on the market not
because they are losing money, but because their owners see a
profit to be made.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the Apollo Group is classic Horatio Alger. Paul
Gregg founded the company 22 years ago when he borrowed $40,000 to
buy his first provincial theater. He built the company into
Britain's largest privately owned entertainment group, with 23
theaters employing 6,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg says SFX's interest in the West End, or Theatreland, as
they call it here, ``is proof of a buoyant 9industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the West End sell-off is bound to provoke soul-searching
here. Already, debate rages over whether to call British-made films
like the Oscar-winning ``Shakespeare In Love'' British at all
because they are made with American money. And American imports
such as ``The Jerry Springer Show'' have been blamed for dumbing
down British television.
</P>
<P>
   The presumption is that American-owned properties will be more
interested in the bottom line than in edifying entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Theatre, Morrison said, the sudden infusion of
American capital should not be a surprise. ``The Yanks,'' she said,
``have the money.''

PUBLISHER FUMES AS CHRETIEN BLOCKS A TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Hell hath no fury like a press baron denied a noble
title.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad Black, erudite owner of a vast Toronto-based newspaper
empire stretching from Vancouver to Jerusalem, is suing the prime
minister of Canada, accusing Jean Chretien of abusing his political
power to prevent Black from being appointed to Britain's House of
Lords.
</P>
<P>
   The suit seems likely to make Canadian legal history. It marks
an extraordinary escalation of the simmering hostility between the
folksy but autocratic prime minister and Canada's most colorful
media mogul.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dynamite,'' said Michael Bliss, a historian at the
University of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The suit says Chretien was motivated by political malice, not
regard for Canadian law, when he interceded with Queen Elizabeth II
in June to prevent Black's elevation to a life peerage.
</P>
<P>
   The queen, who is also Canada's monarch, apparently backed away
from an appointment that seemed inevitable rather than become
embroiled in a quarrel between two powerful Canadian subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the suit maintains that Chretien's was an act of
particularly vicious sabotage, since officials of his own
government already had advised Black of no objections, provided he
did not seek to use the title in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The suit seeks only a token amount in dollar damages _ $17,500,
a pittance to one of Canada's wealthiest citizens. It is intended
solely to clear Black's reputation and force Chretien to
acknowledge wrongdoing, friends and colleagues of Black's say.
</P>
<P>
   Black, 54, who also holds British citizenship, had been
scheduled to receive the nonhereditery title of Lord Black, along
with appointment to the House of Lords, on June 18. The honor,
endorsed by Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, had been meant as
royal recognition of Black's prominence as publisher of London's
Daily Telegraph newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Black is also publisher of Canada's nationally circulated
National Post, an upstart daily launched last year and known for
its financial news, conservative editorial stance and aggressive
coverage of Chretien's government. In addition, Black publishes
scores of other papers.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of Black's ascension to a lordship, Chretien
officials dug up an obscure, 80-year-old resolution by Canada's
Parliament asking the British monarch not to confer titles on
Canadian citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Chretien brought the resolution to the attention of Queen
Elizabeth, making clear he opposed honors for Black.
</P>
<P>
   But according to legal analysts, the musty 1919 resolution
rooted out by Chretien's staff has no legal force. It was
apparently meant then as just a bit of naughty
thumbing-the-nose-at-royalty by a young country still not fully
weaned from Britain's colonial embrace.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Chretien Saturday defended his decision. ``I want
to make clear that I was guided in this matter by longstanding
Canadian policy and custom,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, a fair number of prominent Canadians living in Britain
_ including the founder of Canada's other national daily, the Globe
and Mail _ have received well-publicized peerages and noble titles
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, perhaps, Black is a full British citizen, and
presumably entitled to any honor offered by his adopted land.
Canada specifically permits dual citizenship, and in modern times
has not objected to expatriate Canadians receiving noble honors
from Britain or other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Chretien's loathing of Black is known, almost reminiscent of
Richard N. Nixon's hatred of Katherine Graham, publisher of the
Washington Post during the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no hint of serious corruption during Chretien's
six years in office. But Black's National Post _ unabashedly
conservative in a country that is far more left-leaning than the
United States _ has given prominent coverage to a few fairly minor
government deals that suggest some impropriety, if not illegality,
on the part of Chretien and well-connected associates. The
editorial page has been more stingingly critical of Chretien's
governance than any other major paper.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, it's that coverage, and those
editorials, that have motivated Chretien to block Black's lordship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prime minister shouldn't be allowed, because he's mad at
the National Post coverage, to interfere with anyone's rights,''
said Peter Atkinson, vice president of Black's holding company,
Hollinger Inc. ``What Black's outraged with, and can't live with,
and intends to take to court, is this interference by the prime
minister in his rights.''

ACQUISITION CREATES NEW NEWS DYNAMICS IN BAY AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ and VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The media landscape is shifting. The region's
economy is sizzling. And three newspaper groups are likely to spend
the next few years slugging it out for readers, advertisers and
journalistic laurels in the San Francisco Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Hearst Corporation announced it was buying the
morning San Francisco Chronicle, the largest newspaper in Northern
California, and putting the afternoon San Francisco Examiner up for
sale.
</P>
<P>
   The move sets the stage for a fierce battle for readers between
Hearst; Knight Ridder Inc., publisher of the San Jose Mercury News
and the Contra Costa Times; and Dean Singleton's ANG Newspapers,
which publishes five newspapers mostly in the East Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last five years, we've seen an increased presence of
Knight Ridder, we've seen an increased presence of Singleton, and
now we're going to see an increased presence of the Hearst chain in
the San Francisco Bay Area,'' said Felix Gutierrez, executive
director of the Freedom Forum Pacific Coast Center in San
Francisco, a foundation that studies First Amendment and press
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they do with the newspaper and how they handle it will be
the determining factor of how well it's received,'' Gutierrez said.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst, which is privately held, publishes 12 daily newspapers
as well as weeklies and magazines such as Cosmopolitan, Redbook and
Esquire. Through its Hearst-Argyle affiliate, the company owns 26
television stations and seven radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Knight Ridder, which moved its headquarters to San Jose from
Miami in 1998, publishes 31 daily newspapers. The company is
publicly held.
</P>
<P>
   ANG is controlled by MediaNews Inc., a private company that also
owns the Denver Post, the Los Angeles Daily News and other media
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst's announcement effectively ends the 34-year-old joint
operating agreement (JOA) that guaranteed a 50-50 split of revenue
for the Chronicle and the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Financial details of the purchase were not released. Hearst
bought the Chronicle as well as SF Gate, the newspaper's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   While many media observers doubt a qualified buyer for the
Examiner will emerge, the fate of the afternoon newspaper and its
217 employees remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst executives said that if no one purchases the Examiner,
the newspaper will be combined into the larger morning operation.
The Chronicle, with 380 employees, has a daily circulation of
482,268 readers, while the Examiner has 114,776.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to have a great Hearst newspaper here going forward
under the Chronicle banner,'' said Frank A. Bennack Jr., president
and chief executive officer of Hearst Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Ridder, chairman and chief executive of Knight Ridder, said
Saturday that his company did not envision a change in strategy to
win readers in the economically robust Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Ridder said his company would be interested in purchasing the
Examiner, under certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Hearst would sell their position as it exists today, where
they have 50 percent of the JOA, then we would be interested,''
Ridder said. ``If they're only going to sell their home delivery
circulation list, which is very small, and the name, then we would
not be interested and I doubt anybody else would be either.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennack said Friday that Hearst's acquisition of the Chronicle
in effect ends the JOA.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton has said he considered buying the Chronicle but would
not be interested in buying the Examiner, the flagship newspaper of
the Hearst media empire, and doubted whether others would.
</P>
<P>
   With Hearst's acquisition of the Chronicle, some newspaper
specialists predict a suburban newspaper war in a region with 18
daily newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be fatally optimistic ... there is a chance here to
create one very strong, enterprising, aggressive newspaper,'' said
James Naughton, president of the Poynter Institute, a media think
tank based in St. Petersburg, Fla. ``With just one paper it ought
to be in a position to strengthen its coverage. And if it doesn't,
shame on that.''
</P>
<P>
   The closure of the Bulletin in Philadelphia nearly two decades
ago spurred the Philadelphia Inquirer, a Knight Ridder newspaper,
to step up its coverage, both locally and nationally, said
Naughton, a former Inquirer editor, who envisions a similar
transformation in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Philadelphia should be a lesson to San Francisco. It is
inevitable that the (Hearst) owners will make more money, but I
hope they put a substantial amount of that money back into the news
product.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new Hearst morning newspaper would likely attract readers in
outlying areas, an effort that could bring the company into a
collision with Knight Ridder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, the Chronicle and the Examiner weren't as
assiduous at courting the suburbs as it now looks like they should
have been,'' said Tom Goldstein, former dean of the Graduate School
of Journalism at the University of California at Berkeley and now
dean of Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume Hearst hasn't figured out their strategy yet, but
they can look at a map as well as I,'' Goldstein said. ``They'll
want to push out to the region _ San Francisco by dint of geography
isn't going to grow. Knight Ridder has ringed San Francisco in a
crescent, from Monterey to Contra Costa County. Hearst Corporation
has the resources to create a dynamic competition which hasn't
existed until lately.''
</P>
<P>
   P. Scott McKibben, president and publisher of MediaNews Inc.'s
ANG Newspapers, said his chain is not likely to shift its emphasis
from the East Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our circulation has continued to grow in recent years because
we're sitting in a market where suburban sprawl is growing and
developing,'' said McKibben, whose chain includes the Oakland
Tribune, the Tri-Valley Herald in Pleasanton, the Hayward Daily
Review, the Fremont Argus and the San Mateo County Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like our position. I don't see our strategy changing in
light of the buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Close, executive editor of San Francisco-based Pacific
News Service, an alternative news agency used by the Examiner and
other media outlets, said the Chronicle had lost its voice in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Close said she hoped the underdog image, which she said has
given the Examiner some of its energy, did not get lost in the
event the newspapers merge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it won't gain the exalted view of itself the Chronicle
has,'' she said. ``My hope is the spirit of optimism and
inclusivity ... will continue to drive the staff and the editors of
the Examiner as we go through this transition.''

RICKY'S ONLY ONE STAR IN A HUGE LATIN GALAXY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Music writers call him a one-hit wonder. Others assail him as
``too pop.'' And while Americans bop their heads to the beat of
Ricky Martin's snare drum, the predictions of his demise drop like
bombs. But don't believe a word they say.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them don't know Latin music. They base their predictions
on lesser Latino artists who have come and gone. Most of those
critics had never heard of Martin _ an artist who's been recording
for 15 years _ until his smash single, ``Livin' La Vida Loca.'' As
copies of his self-titled English debut were snatched off the
shelves, with more than 5 million copies sold so far, the critics
had to answer to readers who wanted to know: Why haven't you
written about him?
</P>
<P>
   That's when the scurrying began. Writers flipped through press
releases, searched their electronic libraries to find out what had
been written, listened to the CD a few times, and _ with deadlines
looming _ cranked out superficial reviews. Their idea of context
was ``La Macarena.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Christopher Columbus, the critics thought they had
discovered something. But Ricky's not new. After four years
performing with the Puerto Rican boy group Menudo, he put out four
solo albums.
</P>
<P>
   The critics say he's ``not Latin enough,'' but they'd be hard
pressed to define what that means. Latin pop isn't English verses
set to Latin music. It's not watered-down Latin music. It's not a
new genre, made for American consumers. It is its own vast
category, decades old, just like Latin rock, Latin hip-hop, and
Latin jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Without understanding the history of how Latin pop came to be,
the critics are at a loss. They've got a pocketful of stereotypical
words that they can't use: exotic, spicy, sexy, sultry. Mainstream
music writers sprinkle those words into copy, in an attempt to
capture the essence of music that is foreign to them. And when an
artist like Martin comes along, with vibrant music that sounds
familiar, they get suspicious. That's what happens when they ignore
the music of an entire continent.

   Scores of Latinos _ Marc Anthony, Los Trio-O, Selena _ have had
huge US success with little marketing. One of the biggest surprises
this year came from a group of elderly Cuban musicians who recorded
long-forgotten danzons and sons on ``Buena Vista Social Club.'' It
sold more than 421,000 units in the United States, according to
SoundScan, and picked up a Grammy along the way _ proof that
Americans are hungry for musica Latina.
</P>
<P>
   The critics _ who should be ahead of the trends, introducing us
to new sounds _ realized they missed the story, so now they want to
dismiss Ricky.
</P>
<P>
   And they're missing another trend that's been unfolding in
recent years: the wave of young Latino artists experimenting with
new sounds. Artists like Shakira, Fulanito, Mana, Ilegales, A. B.
Quintanilla Y Los Kumbia Kings, and Dark Latin Groove.
</P>
<P>
   They avoid writing about Latin music, yet less popular genres,
including American folk, get ink. (While we're on the subject, how
can they continue to ignore hip-hop, considering it is the most
influential genre of our time?)
</P>
<P>
   What makes Ricky Martin's music exciting is his incorporation of
rock and jazz. When an American rock artist mixes different sounds,
it's called fusion. And when artists such as Sting or even Madonna
blend in bits of flamenco guitar or beats from a conga, they call
it ``experimental projects.'' But when Latino musicians borrow
elements of rock, critics call it watered down.
</P>
<P>
   Though Latinos love traditional music _ rancheros, plenas,
cumbias, boleros, merengues _ we've long embraced newer musical
styles. It's time for critics to do the same, considering that the
American public, tired of the yawning rhythms of rock, has.
</P>
<P>
   When Ricky Martin performed at the Grammy awards this year,
singing his international hit, ``La Copa de la Vida,'' he brought
down the house. Until then, most Americans hadn't heard of him,
even though millions of copies of ``The Cup of Life'' had sold
throughout Europe, Latin America, and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, as I drove around Puerto Rico, Ricky's homeland,
his voice seemed to echo everywhere, from bustling San Juan to
quaint rural towns. The island's governor, Pedro Rossello, adopted
it as a theme song while campaigning for statehood before the
plebescite. Campaign vans with monster stereo systems blared
Martin's pulsating music. The hypnotic rhythms made you want to
dance in your sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as that sound rumbles throughout America, I have to wonder:
Will the critics be ready for the next Latin music star? Or will
they dust off those ``Macarena'' reviews?

WHEN GENERATIONS AND CULTURES CLASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN LUPO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A jump in violent crime among Cape Verdean youth has prompted
social workers to raise an issue that has confronted immigrant
families for well over a century: Who's in charge, the parents or
their children?
</P>
<P>
   Immigrant parents may feel alienated from a culture, a language,
and a political system that confuse them. Their offspring, on the
other hand, assimilate rapidly, enabling them to run family affairs
and assert an independence that can scare their elders.
</P>
<P>
   The result, says Victor DoCouto, executive director of the
Massachusetts Alliance of Portuguese Speakers, is what he
experienced as a 6-year-old immigrant from the Azores in the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked up the language like a sponge,'' DoCoutu recalled.
``By the time I was 9 or 10, I was the family social worker. Back
on the islands, my old man didn't need me for anything except maybe
to go out and play. Here, he needed me for everything, to fill out
forms for job applications, to read the mail. My mother took me out
of school on days when she needed me to go to the hospital and act
as an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it did for me,'' he said, ``was to empower me to the
point where I don't think it is healthy. It places you in a power
position. If you're not really careful, you can really wield that,
and some kids do.''
</P>
<P>
   In the clash of cultures and values that has bedeviled immigrant
families throughout history, the implications are often harmless.
</P>
<P>
   One day, for example, in the back of Uncle Pete's Hickory Ribs
restaurant in East Boston, two Latino couples came in with their
children. The restaurant is owned by an Italian-American man and
his Thai wife; the cooks are Latinos, and the food is pure Southern
barbeque. In the back, the Latino couples conversed with their kids
in Spanish; when the youngsters spoke to one another, they did so
in English. The whole scene resembled what most Americans desire of
immigration and diversity.
</P>
<P>
   At other times, the implications can be deadly, as the offspring
of immigrants totally reject the culture of their origins or,
worse, fall for the lure of easy money and become youth gang
members and, later, adult criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout history, critics of immigration have blamed violent
crime on newcomers. Indeed, some immigrants were bad overseas and
saw no reason to convert once they got here.
</P>
<P>
   But, as historian James Truslow Adams cautioned 70 years ago,
``It is impossible to blame the situation on the `foreigners.' The
overwhelming mass of them were law-abiding in their own lands. If
they became lawless here, it must be largely due to the American
atmosphere and conditions. There seems to be plenty of evidence to
prove that the immigrants are made lawless by America rather than
that America is made lawless by them.''
</P>
<P>
   Crime is the extreme end of the shock of change that has often
overwhelmed every immigrant group from the Irish of the 1840s to
the Cape Verdeans of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``The American Irish,'' William V. Shannon wrote of
the immigrant peasant, ``America, he learned, was not the land of
the good peasant. It was the first of many sad disillusionments to
observe that in this new homeland the ruthless fellow, the mean,
tight-fisted man who grabbed what he could and shared nothing, made
out best. Much of the sense of status was lost. The ex-peasant
could not keep his place because he could not find it. He had to go
out and fight to find whatever place he could.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter in 1906 to the editor of the Yiddish-language
newspaper ``The Jewish Forward,'' a woman from New York's Lower
East Side told of finding a man shivering in the cold because, she
said, his children had neglected him, even though his two sons and
a daughter were making a good living. ``And with all this,'' she
wrote, ``he stands on the street and waits for the door of a
certain woman to open, who gives him each morning a few glasses of
tea and bread and thus keeps him alive. It is outrageous when such
a thing is passed over.''
</P>
<P>
   Muriel Heiberger, executive director of the Massachusetts
Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, sees generational
conflict and cultural shock in immigrant families as ``a kind of
common thread that does run through the migration regardless of the
time period in which it took place.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Heiberger cautioned, ``It has sped up dramatically. The
late-20th-century experience is not exactly the same as that of
your and my grandparents. Technology, television, marketing have
created a common international youth culture that puts pressures on
immigrant kids. There was a kind of insularity in the old immigrant
communities that doesn't exist today.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, the immigrant's children translated for their
parents and, perhaps, registered their young siblings for school.
Local political machines could fill in the gaps. The machines are
long gone, replaced by a confusing mix of federal, state, and local
government agencies and nonprofit organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the traditional generational conflicts and the
complexities of dealing with large institutions are problems
specific to certain immigrant groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is, for example, a legalistic conflict,'' explained Paul
Watanabe, an associate professor of political science at the
University of Massachusetts at Boston, and codirector of the
Institute for Asian American Studies. ``For a long time, Asians
were prevented from becoming citizens. Yet their children, born in
the United States, were citizens. That creates an inevitable
tension in the legal status between children and parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Watanabe, a Japanese-American, said that when the US government
forcibly interned Japanese residents during World War II,
generational tensions ``went beyond the boiling point,'' because
the government used Japanese-American citizens to run the camps,
thereby relegating the patriarchal elders to ``childlike
powerlessness.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's immigrants, he added, are largely from Asia and Latin
America and, therefore, also face racial hostility.
</P>
<P>
   DoCouto said the racial issue is particularly difficult for Cape
Verdeans, who may speak Portuguese and feel European but are
dark-skinned and live in African-American neighborhoods. ``So where
do the kids mainstream?'' he asks. ``Into black culture? Cape
Verdean? White culture?''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the generational issue even further is the reason
many newer immigrants are here. That may have less to do with
leaving one's homeland in search of a better economic life and more
to do with foreign policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Vietnamese, Cambodians, and Somalis, for example,
came here as refugees from political persecution.
</P>
<P>
   The Somali population in the Boston area numbers between 3,000
and 4,000, about 90 percent of whom were brought over in the last
five years by the US government, according to Abdiraham Yusuf,
chairman, and Abdulkadir Y. Hussein, executive director, at the
Somali Development Center in Jamaica Plain.
</P>
<P>
   ``When families came over voluntarily,'' said Yusuf, ``they
might not mind if their children assimilated as quickly as
possible. But we have families who in their wildest dreams never
thought they'd be in Boston, Massachusetts. They didn't know where
Boston was. They are from an underdeveloped nation that has gone
through a civil war. A great deal of adjustment is needed.''
</P>
<P>
   That means everything from explaining the welfare system to
convincing parents that their daughters' desire to wear faddish
teenage clothing does not imply loose morals.
</P>
<P>
   Many immigrant families make adjustments and compromises, not
without pain. Others cannot, and leave behind them the image of the
Irish peasant without a piece of land or the Jewish man waiting on
the streets of New York for a piece of bread and a sympathetic ear.

MOYNIHAN SEES WHAT OTHERS DON'T 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Among other big things, Daniel Patrick Moynihan's
illustrious career in public service demonstrates the power of
analytical thinking in politics.
</P>
<P>
   The New York senator has contributed so many gems ahead of his
time in nearly four decades on the stage _ from his research on the
condition of ghetto families to his perception of Richard Nixon's
great opportunity as freshly elected president to be the American
Disraeli to his reflections on the blindness of the late-Cold War
CIA to the reality of Soviet weakness _ that one hesitates to pick
one.
</P>
<P>
   But as the chairman-for-life of the Bowtie Caucus rose last week
to lead the opposition to an irresponsible tax cut, it was hard not
to think of a classically Moynihan cut-like-a-diamond paragraph. To
wit:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans' dominant idea, at least for the moment, seems
to be that the social controls of modern government have become
tyrannical or, at the very least, exorbitantly expensive. This
oppression _ so the strategic analysis goes _ is made possible by
taxation, such that cutting taxes becomes an objective in its own
right, business cycles notwithstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   That would command respect, and journalistic envy, as
contemporary commentary under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   But now consider that Moynihan wrote that for The New York Times
nearly 20 years ago, in the early summer of 1980, before Ronald
Reagan had even been elected. It was merely one observation in a
string of them that over time have come to define the terms of
national debate. It is no accident that people who have no
knowledge of Moynihan's astonishing track record see tax cuts well
down on their list of priorities, more as danger than as worthwhile
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, much of the political class was wasting time in
parlor games over whether people like then-Representative Jack Kemp
were correct in their ``new'' theory that government revenues would
be larger with lower tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   But Moynihan saw a deeper purpose, though not in Kemp's advocacy
per se. Moynihan saw Kemp's party moving away from opposition to
particular initiatives of government on their alleged demerits,
battles they had been losing consistently over issues from medical
care for the elderly to providing federal aid to poverty-impacted
school districts; he saw the Republicans embracing a new strategy
of attacking government itself and avoiding the burden of arguing
specifics, by trying to starve it through tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   And he was already warning by 1980 that the Republicans were
likely to prevail in the short term if they succeeded in attacking
government on behalf of working taxpayers as pseudo-populists,
leaving the Democrats as statist, status quo defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan proved Moynihan correct within days of assuming
office, though the senator had to endure much ridicule before
Reagan spoke of disciplining the child of government by cutting its
allowance.
</P>
<P>
   But there was much more to come:
</P>
<P>
   --It was Moynihan who pounced on the gimmickry and dishonesty of
budget director David Stockman (whom he had mentored at Harvard a
decade earlier) to show that hemorrhaging deficits had been
deliberately engineered.
</P>
<P>
   --It was Moynihan who first and most cogently saw through all
the schemes to ``balance'' the budget in formulaic ways that dodged
specific choices _ from amendments to the Constitution, the main
effect of which would be to make recessions far worse, to
``automatic'' spending cuts that politics and good sense would
never allow to take effect.
</P>
<P>
   --And it was Moynihan who more than a decade ago first caused a
stir by noting that operating surpluses in the Social Security
trust funds were being in effect embezzled to mask and fund
deficits in the rest of government. Today, his once-subversive
analysis is the basis of (at last) sound policy that the latest tax
cut scheme would severely undermine.
</P>
<P>
   All this, by the way, was prelude to Moynihan's signal
accomplishment as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee in
President Clinton's first term. It was Moynihan who guided the 1993
budget plan to passage, which in tandem with a first installment he
supported under President Bush in 1980, made a balanced budget
possible and created the crucial fiscal environment for the current
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   His typically reasoned and civil opposition last week came up
one vote short in an absurdly political atmosphere on the Senate
floor, but the Republican victory reeked of Pyrrhus's.
</P>
<P>
   After all we've learned, much of it from Moynihan, it is hard to
imagine we are anywhere near making the same colossal mistake again
after a $4 trillion run-up in the national debt that the senator
also foresaw.

NEW YORK MUSEUMS: NEW AND RENEWED 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Part of the mega-plan for the renovation/expansion of the Boston
Museum of Fine Arts is the overhaul of the galleries devoted to
Greek and Roman art _ now part of the Art of the Ancient World,
after MFA director Malcolm Rogers's recent restructuring. Boston's
classical galleries are currently Third World places, cooled by
electric fans, dingy, and out of date by any measure.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York has recently, and
triumphantly, restored seven of its Greek galleries _ at a reported
cost of $75 million. Unlike Boston's, stuck at the back of the
building, the Met's are just to the left of the main entrance, in
one of the museum's most conspicuous locations. Their centerpiece
is a 140-foot-long vaulted hall, now a forest of classical
sculpture, culminating at the far end with an Ionic column capital
the size of a room, excavated at Sardis, ancient capital of Lydia.
It's a stunning punctuation to a stunning vista.
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't know the Met's Greek galleries had been redone,
you wouldn't guess: That's their strength. Architect Kevin Roche
did nothing tricky here. He made the rooms look pretty much as they
did in 1917, when their design _ by McKim, Mead, and White _ was
accomplished. The same firm did the Boston Public Library; in both
buildings, the architects used skylights that were covered over
during World War II. The Met's _ deeply recessed into the curved
vaulting _ have now been uncovered and improved. The natural light
that animates the space below made me yearn to see the BPL's
skylights operational again (which they will be, in the course of
the library's ongoing restoration).
</P>
<P>
   The new addition to the design for the Met's Greek galleries is
four unobtrusive doorways connecting the main hall with side
spaces, giving a sense of openness and ease of passage, and making
you feel that while the arrangement of objects is chronological,
you can create your own route.
</P>
<P>
   And what objects these are. Many would argue that the classical
collections the Met began acquiring when it was founded, in 1870,
are preeminent in the Western Hemisphere. The new installation is
dense, in a traditional, 19th-century style, so you have to be
selective if you're not going to spend the rest of your life here.
I focused first on the haunting, mute, almost featureless Cycladic
figures that read as ancient precursors of modern minimalism, then
on a recent acquisition, a terra-cotta chest-shaped Minoan coffin
painted with rambunctious, delightfully unrefined geometrics. The
so-called New York Kouros, circa 590-580 BCE, is one of the
earliest surviving figurative statues from Attica and one of the
Met's treasures. Two and a half millennia after its creation, its
rigid, simplified, uncompromising pose captivated 20th-century
artists including Picasso. A marble grave stele of a little girl
shows the chubby child clutching her two pet doves, as if saying
farewell. To cheer up after a sad moment in front of her, I turned
to a red-figured terra-cotta vessel in the form of a lobster claw,
thinking it would be more at home in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Museums are ruled by marketing, and the Met's classical
galleries now end with a satellite gift shop. Beyond that is the
restaurant, a huge, colonnaded atrium that began life as a gallery
for Roman sculpture _ which it will be again. The Met is ousting
the dining facility to restore the room to its original use, to
make a progression from Greek to Roman that makes sense. A
computer-generated photo shows what the new Roman Court will look
like _ a setting more fitting for statues of Caesar than Caesar
salad.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A great many classical sculptures have lost their heads through
vandalism or the wear and tear of time. Polish-born contemporary
sculptor Magdalena Abakanowicz makes her figures headless
intentionally, emphasizing their universality. Often, they line up
in quasi-military formations, as if parading to some unknown
destination. They're marching on top of the Met this summer, in a
powerful installation on the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Roof Garden.
Silhouetted against the Manhattan skyline, looming over Central
Park, they read like silent witnesses to urban folly. You can see
Abakanowicz works the world over, but this rooftop setting gives
them particular meaning, a sense of remove from everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   In communist Poland, Abakanowicz had to scrounge stuff to make
art, using everything from twigs to fabric. She became famous for
huge relief weavings, and figures of burlap and sisal. Her current
figures are bronze, but the surfaces are heavily scarred by knives,
rags, and the artist's hands, as if to recall her former methods
and materials. The bronze is the color of mud, making the figures
look like they were made of primal ooze.
</P>
<P>
   Abakanowicz's ``Backward Seated Figures'' number 11, and they
sit facing away from you, toward the park, as if meditating.
They're hollow, as her figures tend to be, scooped out and
slouched, looking almost like beach chairs. Part of her message is
how little it takes not just to suggest a human being, but to make
you empathize with one. You want to view these figures from their
hollow fronts as well as their backs, to see what's missing as well
as what's there.
</P>
<P>
   While Abakanowicz most often creates collectives, her ``Figure
on Trunk'' stands alone, balancing on a tree trunk in turn balanced
on two round logs _ a precarious position, hinting that isolation
is dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Most poignant of all the Met works are the 40 adolescent-size
bodies of ``Bambini,'' a Children's Crusade en route to who knows
where, as touching as that little girl in the Greek galleries
saying goodbye to her doves.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Context counts immensely in displaying sculpture, as the new
installations at the Met demonstrate. In midtown, at Rockefeller
Center's Channel Gardens, which link Fifth Avenue to the Center
tower itself, is another instance of sculpture in a suitable
context, a group of Paul Manship's works on view through Sept. 6.
Most are on loan from Brookgreen Gardens in South Carolina, which
has extensive collections of early 20th-century sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Manship, who died in 1966, spent much of his career in
Gloucester, where a community of sculptors flourished in his era.
Trained academically, he moved into Art Deco, producing sleek,
streamlined figures of humans and animals, often related to myth.
His work is sometimes shown around Boston, but often poorly, in
cluttered surroundings that detract from its elegance and make it
look outmoded. In the Rockefeller Center gardens, a formal,
symmetrical setting of benches, lush plantings, fountains, and
water streaming down toward a sunken restaurant, Manship's gods and
goddesses look perfectly at home.
</P>
<P>
   He thought big. His 1924 ``Cycle of Life'' is a sundial in the
form of a sphere, laden with symbols of family life, the zodiac,
the elements, the hours of the day, all resting on a base of
turtles, ancient symbols of eternity. And he thought active. His
``Diana and Actaeon'' are running in opposite directions, leaping
balletically, she having just transformed him into a stag, the
scene made more hectic by growling hounds.
</P>
<P>
   This temporary installation complements the great Manship that
is a permanent part of Rockefeller Center, his exuberant 1934 gilt
bronze ``Prometheus,'' a sunstruck representation of the very first
sculptor, who fashioned man out of clay.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Months before Rogers abruptly restructured the entire MFA,
putting senior staff members out of jobs, Maxwell Anderson did
something similar at the Whitney, rearranging curatorial
responsibilities and leaving some curators without portfolio. As a
result, the Whitney hemorrhaged staff and made headlines.
</P>
<P>
   But long before Anderson took over as director of the Whitney
Museum of American Art last year, the institution and controversay
were wedded. It's usually the shows that raise the ruckus, though,
not the backstage maneuvering. Whitney biennials are nearly always
trashed by nearly everybody. Like many of the recent biennials, the
current extravaganza, ``The American Century: Art &AMP; Culture
1900-2000,'' tries too hard and ends up wanting. It's the biggest
show in Whitney history, the museum's bid to regain its position as
the leading champion of American art. That position has been
threatened not only by the Whitney's weak programming, but from
increased competition from other major New York museums paying
closer attention to home-grown work.

 NEW YORK: ... home-grown work.

   The Whitney splits the century down the middle: Part 1,
1900-1950, is up through Aug. 22; Part 2, covering 1950-2000, is up
Sept. 26 through mid-February. The curators of Part 2, Barbara
Haskell and Susan Cooke, have spread their net too wide, trying to
cover film, dance, architecture, music, literature _ all of
20th-century culture in addition to visual arts. Arranged
chronologically but also by theme, the show starts on the top
floor, with Gilded Age portraiture that's not gilt-edged. No
large-scale Sargent portraits of robber barons or socialites here,
just smaller or lesser examples of the genre, with the shining
exception of Thomas Eakins's austere 1900 ``The Thinker: Portrait
of Louis N. Kenton.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the themes you can trace in the show _ photography's
abstraction of the body, paintings that are precursors of Pop, the
aestheticizing of industrial design _ one of the more significant
is the rise of the city, literally and figuratively. It's the
implied subject of Alfred Stieglitz's 1907 photograph of
immigrants, ``The Steerage''; of paintings of the vertical
cityscape by Joseph Stella; of Paul Frankl's 1926 ``Skyscraper
Bookcase,'' undistinguished save for its shape.

   The Whitney's jumbled galleries on several floors add to the
confused look of this overview that offers no revelations. So much
of this material has been examined in such depth that the
once-over-lightly approach is unhelpful to all but those with no
clue whatsoever of the subject. The show is short on star objects,
too, although some icons _ including Grant Wood's ``American
Gothic,'' Marcel Duchamp's ``Fountain,'' and Charles Demuth's ``The
Figure 5 in Gold'' _ are here. They're not put in any intelligible
context, though; they're just part of a seemingly endless lineup,
unenlightening and unentertaining.
</P>
<P>
   Part 2 promises to be better, if only because the second half of
the century was when America came to dominate the art world, with
Abstract Expressionism and succeeding isms. As for Part 1, the
Australian critic Robert Hughes provided a far more cohesive and
even more exciting overview of the same material, as well as the
rest of American art, in his 1997 book and television series
``American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The chief curator of Part 2 of ``The American Century'' is Lisa
Phillips, who departed the Whitney in the wake of Anderson's
changes. Phillips has now become the second director of the New
Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo, succeeding founding director
Marcia Tucker, herself a refugee from the Whitney 23 years ago,
after then-director Tom Armstrong fired her. Certain of her shows
had outraged even knowledgeable art lovers, and she'd decided that
the uptown museum was moving toward fundable art. ``Fundable''
didn't describe the art Tucker wanted to show, and the New Museum
quickly acquired a reputation for politicized, even scandalous
exhibitions, for nose-thumbing shows like the 1978 `` `Bad'
Painting.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Museum's rough-and-tumble aura has been diluted as other
museums across the country have taken up its causes, a wide variety
of marginalized art by marginalized artists: There are a lot of
curators out scouring the margins these days.
</P>
<P>
   For all Tucker's scoffing at fundable art, the New Museum is
doing some fund-raising of its own, completing a $6 million capital
campaign, its first. The museum unveiled a renovated and enlarged
facility last year, designed by Colin Cathcart, with expanded
gallery space and a revenue-generating bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   Among the current shows is Tucker's swan song, ``The Time of Our
Lives,'' up through Oct. 17. Its theme is aging and ageism,
appropriate in a country where the percentage of those 65 and older
is growing faster than any other demographic group. ``The Time of
Our Lives,'' which includes work by over 60 artists in a wide range
of media, isn't unique in offering images of nude elderly bodies,
even sexually active elderly bodies, but it does a good job with
the what-is-beauty? question.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Giant'' of the title of Jeff Wall's Cibachrome
transparency is a huge, nude, older woman standing in the middle of
a public library, utterly unnoticed, a sly comment on the
invisibility of the old in society. Jacqueline Hayden's
black-and-white photo of an elderly, nude, sagging man and woman,
his hand on her nipple and hers on his thigh, suggests the memory
of sex rather than the prospect of it. But in the ``70 + 1''
hologram by Boston artist Harriet Casdin-Silver, the nude artist
clutches her breasts and closes her eyes in an expression of
ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   At the entrance of the show is a clever allusion to the grim
reaper, Bruce Cannon's ``The Time of Your Life,'' a deceptively
old-fashioned-looking clock able to calculate when, according to
insurance actuarial tables, you should die. Should you survive past
your assigned date, the clock sends messages of congratulations.

   Critical mass is critical in attracting masses of visitors to
museums. The SoHo block of Broadway between Houston and Prince
streets includes not only the New Museum, but the Museum for
African Art and the Guggenheim Museum SoHo as well, all housed in
historic buildings of substance and charm. The interior of the
African museum, which moved to its current site in 1993, was
designed by Maya Lin, acclaimed architect of the Vietnam Wall,
obviously working here on a next-to-nothing budget. She used color
and windowed rooms within rooms to break up an otherwise
unarticulated two-floor space.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's mission is not just to attract visitors to its own
building, but to send shows out to the wider world. Locally, both
the Worcester Art Museum and the Davis Museum at Wellesley College
have presented shows toured by the African museum. The current
exhibitions in SoHo are a typical mix: ``A Congo Chronicle: Patrice
Lumumba in Urban Art'' and ``Three African Traditions: The Art of
the Dogon, Fang, and Songye,'' both up through Aug. 15. The big
fall show sounds particularly promising: ``Liberated Voices:
Contemporary Art From South Africa,'' organized by Frank Herreman
and featuring art of the post-apartheid era. Among the 13 artists
in the show, an abbreviated Who's Who of South African art, is Paul
Stopforth, an emigre who has made Boston his home for more than a
decade. Stopforth's powerful 1980 triptych ``The Interrogators,''
the faces of the men who tortured apartheid martyr Steve Biko, will
be shown in this country for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The Guggenheim SoHo, which opened in 1992 with an Arata
Isozaki-designed interior and splashy shows that drew disappointing
numbers, closed this past winter for a reconfiguration. It's now
reopened with a long-term installation of Andy Warhol's largest and
last series, ``The Last Supper.''
</P>
<P>
   The space itself is spectacular, a pair of huge, long galleries
with columns running down their spines and immense windows along
several walls. The columns and windows limit what, and how much,
art can be shown here. But there's no denying that the galleries
are glorious, or that they suit the Warhols. It would be hard to
find another space big enough to accommodate them in quantity, and
quantity counts here.
</P>
<P>
   Warhol became as obsessed with Leonardo's ``Last Supper'' as
Picasso was with Velazquez's ``Las Meninas.'' The Pope of Pop
created over 100 variations on the ``Last Supper'' theme, and just
a month before his death in 1987, he exhibited 22 of them in Milan,
across the street from the church that houses the Leonardo.
</P>
<P>
   In Warholian fashion, the artist worked from cheap reproductions
of ``The Last Supper,'' and cropped and repeated the image as if it
were part of an ad campaign. He painted it in dark-on-dark, so it's
barely legible; he silk-screened it; he collaged and camouflaged
it; he added logos including the one for Wise potato chips. Rather
than a show of disrespect, the cumulative effect is fascination
bordering on reverence, a reminder of Warhol's devout Catholic
upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   When museums started moving to SoHo or opening branches there,
rents were still reasonable. But the neighborhood has changed, gone
upscale, making it harder for the museums to retain their hold on
the real estate. And so the Guggenheim SoHo's reconfiguration
includes renting out a prime street-level space to a soon-to-open
Prada store. Warhol, a consumer-culture and fashion junkie, would
have loved the juxtaposition of $1,000 pocketbooks on the ground
floor with Jesus upstairs.

<P>
   HAMBURG, Conn. _ The big Hemlock trees at Burnham Brook once
grew so thick and close that other plants could not survive in
their shade. They were masters of this 450-acre wood, creating a
cool, open world beneath their boughs where visitors had escaped
the summer sun for generations.
</P>
<P>
   But, today, the wood looks like it was ravaged by a forest fire.
Seventy-foot hemlocks stand bare as far as the eye can see,
surrounded by their own fallen branches basking in the sunlight
that finally streams through the trees.
</P>
<P>
   This is the unfortunate handiwork of the woolly adelgid, a bug
no bigger than the period at the end of a sentence, which is
decimating some of the Northeast's oldest and most valuable
forests. What adelgids lack in size, they make up for in numbers,
swarming even the tiniest hemlocks by the tens of thousands and
literally sucking the life out of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is your future forest, at least as far as hemlocks are
concerned,'' said Harvard University forest ecologist Dave Orwig,
kneeling beside a six-inch hemlock seedling at Burnham Brook that
is already coated by the adelgids' white egg sacs. ``We could lose
hemlocks across broad areas for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The adelgid's assault threatens a species that has been an
important part of evergreen forests from Maine to Virginia for
8,000 years. Slow-growing and long-lived, hemlocks over the decades
can drive out other trees until all that remains is the dense green
foliage of the hemlocks, creating a shadowy, primeval forest floor.
</P>
<P>
   Most old growth forests in Massachusetts from Mount Greylock in
Adams to the Virginia Woods in Stoneham are dominated by hemlocks.
Mature hemlocks also play an important role in preventing soil
erosion around water bodies, since they grow readily in the moist
soil, and they are logged for everything from lumber to high-grade
mulch.
</P>
<P>
   Just 14 years after their arrival in New England, the quiet
insect aggressors have reached every mainland county in southern
New England (except Berkshire County in Massachusetts), invading
everywhere from the woods that surround Greater Boston's water
supply to the trees that shade the Brookline golf course where the
Ryder Cup golf tournament will be played next month.
</P>
<P>
   No one has yet found a way to stop the bugs' 12 to 18
mile-a-year northward advance from Virginia that has already
covered 11 states.
</P>
<P>
   The speed and thoroughness of the adelgids' invasion draws
comparisons to other infamous tree scourges such as Dutch elm
disease, the fungus-borne affliction that has killed many of the
graceful shade trees that have lined New England streets over the
last 50 years. Like the fungus, originally from Asia, that causes
the elm disease, the woolly adelgid comes originally from Japan and
has no natural enemies to control its population here. In its
native Japan, for reasons not fully understood, the adelgid poses
little threat to overall hemlock health.
</P>
<P>
   Property owners can protect individual hemlocks by spraying on
an oil coating or injecting the roots with a pesticide that kills
adelgids, but these remedies would be both overwhelmingly expensive
and impractical for use on almost all of the 3.2 million acres of
hemlock forest on the East Coast. Unless someone comes up with an
antidote that can be used widely, Orwig and fellow Harvard
ecologist David Foster say the hemlock's future is ``bleak.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, researchers are pinning their hopes on a tiny ladybug,
discovered in Japan by a Connecticut researcher, that apparently
eats nothing but woolly adelgids. This year, the US Forest Service
funded the release of 125,000 adelgid-eating ladybugs in eight
states in hopes that they would make themselves at home.
</P>
<P>
   The ladybugs ``are very aggressive and they do eat a lot of
adelgids. We just hope they can catch up with the adelgid, which
has gotten quite a head start,'' said Robert Chianese, chief of the
bureau of biological pest control at New Jersey's Department of
Agriculture, which reared the ladybugs for the experiments.
</P>
<P>
   However, even before the ladybugs were released in this state,
they were caught up in controversy. The Metropolitan District
Commission declined to take the ladybugs to help protect 3,000
hemlocks around the Quabbin Reservoir, Boston's water supply
located in central Massachusetts, because some MDC advisers feared
the imported bugs could cause unforeseen damage.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, officials at the Arnold Arboretum in Boston
were unable to obtain ladybugs, largely because Mark McClure of the
Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, discoverer of the
adelgid-eating bug, felt the infestation at the arboretum was too
far advanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted it on a new infestation so the beetles stood a
chance of making a difference,'' explained Charles Burnham,
supervisor of the forest health program at the Department of
Environmental Management.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Souto of the US Forest Service office in Durham, N.H.,
the office that oversaw ladybug releases in New England, argued
that the Arboretum and other locations that could responsibly
manage them should get the ladybugs, equating them with an
experimental AIDS treatment that is risky but worthwhile because of
the severity of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``My preference would be to get them out in the woods and get
people comfortable with handling them, Souto said.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, Massachusetts Department of Environmental
Management officials say they won't know if the Wilbraham
experiment was successful until November when the adelgids feed
actively. And three more years of monitoring will be needed before
state officials are satisfied the bugs are safe for wider use.
</P>
<P>
   With little immediate hope of a cure, the woolly adelgid spells
death for many hemlocks before it can even reach them, as property
owners cut the trees down before the infestation turns their wood
to mush. A quarter of the hemlock forests in Connecticut visited by
Harvard researchers have been logged, and forest managers in
Massachusetts are following suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking seriously at . . . getting a logging company to
come in here and log (public hemlock trees) because we're not going
to be able to save them,'' said Paul Willis, the tree warden in
Brookline, Mass. where the adelgid has already killed scores of
trees at the Putterham Meadows Golf Course.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the woolly adelgid hardly seemed a major threat when
it first arrived in the Pacific Northwest from Japan around 1921,
perhaps in a shipment of ornamental trees. Northwestern hemlocks
seemed to withstand the bugs just fine and, even when the adelgid
was inadvertently transported to Richmond, Virginia, in the 1950s,
ecologists believed it was an isolated problem.
</P>
<P>
   However, the adelgids picked up steam as birds and the winds
carried them north into prime hemlock territory of Pennsylvania and
New Jersey. Because each adelgid can reproduce alone, the arrival
of one bug can spell the beginning of the end for a forest. Today,
an estimated 90 percent of the hemlock forests in New Jersey are
infested.
</P>
<P>
   The adelgids crossed into Connecticut in 1985 on the winds of
Hurricane Gloria, and quickly dashed hopes that New England's
colder winters might slow them down. All but five of Connecticut's
169 municipalities now report adelgids, including Hamburg where the
damage is among the worst anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The infestation reached Massachusetts in 1989, bringing adelgids
to 85 communities and every mainland county except Berkshire so
far. Hoping to slow the advance, the three northern New England
states of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont have restricted hemlock
log imports, but few believe that is more than a stopgap measure.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's Orwig, who has visited 150 hemlock forests studying
the adelgid's effects, said he has been repeatedly surprised at the
intensity of the adelgid's attacks. At Burnham Brook, he assumed
the adelgids would die after the hemlocks did, but they remained.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's either just a huge army (of adelgids) out there, or
one got on'' each sapling and reproduced, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, damage from the infestation in southern New England has
been fairly invisible to the public, both because places such as
Burnham Brook are remote, and because adelgids are hard to detect
until the tree dies. The egg sacs on the bottom of needles are easy
to miss, and a tree can continue to live with them for two to nine
years before the needles drop off.
</P>
<P>
   But, forest managers all over New England are already making
tough decisions about the fate of the hemlocks, from paying $100
per tree for an injection that provides a year of protection to
simply watching the trees die.
</P>
<P>
   At the Arnold Arboretum, officials selected 200 to 300 trees for
preservation, mostly with horticultural oil, out of a collection of
about 2,400 hemlocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided that, for most of the trees on Hemlock Hill, we are
going to let nature take its course . . . The adelgid will probably
take most of them,'' said the arboretum's Peter Del Tredici.
</P>
<P>
   At the Quabbin Reservoir, MDC officials have shied away from
treatments of all kind _ oil is hazardous to water, anyway _
concluding that the dead hemlocks will not jeopardize water quality
as long as new trees grow in their place to prevent erosion.
``Forest cover is what we're concerned about,'' said Dave Small,
the MDC's forest and park regional coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   While managers wrestle with the unpleasant choices, researchers
continue looking for a silver bullet to stop the adelgids. McClure
of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station estimates that
the Japanese ladybugs are 45 to 90 percent effective in killing
adelgids, and early field research shows that the bugs can survive
Northeastern weather.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists also are studying other potential bio-weapons, such
as adelgid-killing fungi, Chinese beetles, and other predators. And
researchers at the National Arboretum in Washington are trying to
develop a hybrid Eastern hemlock that can resist the adelgids.
</P>
<P>
   But all the potential solutions don't matter much to forests
that are already in the path of the adelgid, such as Brookline,
where the town recently put up $40,000 to remove 120 dead hemlocks.
Asked town arborist George Barlow, ``What good is (a solution) 10
years from now if all the trees are dead?''

COURT RULINGS BROADEN VIEW OF THE FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The two rulings, coming just a week apart this summer,
made legally plain what has been culturally clear for years: a
family is no longer just Mom, Dad and the kids.
</P>
<P>
   By boldly granting visitation rights to two non-parents _
including a lesbian who had helped raise her former partner's
biological child and an aunt _ the state's highest court waded
confidently into one of the thorniest social and political debates
in contemporary American society: the evolving notion of
``family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that . . . (a) `family' may no longer be
constituted simply of a wage-earning father, his dependent wife,
and the couple's children,'' wrote Supreme Judicial Court Justice
Margaret Marshall last month, in yet a third decision dealing with
non-traditional families.
</P>
<P>
   And while the high court struck down a City of Boston policy
granting health benefits to the partners of homosexual and
heterosexual city employees _ saying it was against the law _ the
court suggested that it might be time for lawmakers to change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adjustments in the legislation to reflect these new social and
economic realities must come from the Legislature,'' Marshall wrote
for the majority.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation where families now come in a dizzying array of
configurations, many say the SJC's expansive notion of family is
much-welcome and long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is facing the realities of families today,'' said
Robert Volk, an associate professor of law at Boston University who
specializes in gay and lesbian rights. ``Families have changed, and
what constitutes a family has changed, and the court is saying that
it realizes that.''
</P>
<P>
   Others see the court's recent rulings as a disturbing trend
designed to undermine the traditional family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we understand there are very untraditional domestic
arrangements today, the question is, `Which kind of family do we
want to make normative?' '' said C.J. Doyle, executive director of
the Catholic Action League of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe a traditional family of a mother and father raising
a child is the best way to socialize a child.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, legal recognition of non-traditional families ``is a
breaking wave, and Massachusetts is not the only state that's doing
this,'' said Mary E. O'Connell, a professor of law at Northeastern
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is doing it in a rather aggressive and very
child-centered way, and it's doing it judicially rather than
legislatively,'' O'Connell said. ``The court's taking a big step,
and it knows it's taking a big step, and it's taking it very
carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's focus on family comes at a time when paternity suits
rival divorce filings in volume, ever-growing numbers of
grandparents are involved in custody battles and most states allow
same-sex couples to adopt children.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the court's liberal leaning on custody and
visitation cases is, in Volk's view, a ``refreshing breath of
realism from the judicial system.''
</P>
<P>
   But some family law practitioners, who witness the ravages of
divorce and custody battles daily, believe the high court is
overstepping its bounds, and worry that the recent rulings raise
more questions than they answer.
</P>
<P>
   What's next, they wonder? Visitation rights for stepparents and
au pairs? And how do matters like child support and alimony factor
into the SJC's recent decisions?
</P>
<P>
   Still, legal experts cautioned that the court's recent rulings
were highly ``fact-specific.'' In the case of the aunt, for
example, the child referred to the woman as ``mom'' and had lived
with her for most of her life. By no means, then, does the SJC's
ruling mean all aunts will win visitation privileges in the future,
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just assume now that because you lived in the same
household with a child and had a wonderful relationship with that
child, that's going to mean something'' in court, said Boston
attorney Elaine Epstein, a family law specialist.
</P>
<P>
   In Epstein's judgment, the SJC's recent rulings are ``positive
in that they make a statement that the court wishes to keep pace
with the times, and negative in a sense of opening up a new set of
doors without defining what's there.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Charles Fried , in a stinging 14-page dissent in the
lesbian visitation case, warned against opening those doors,
calling the majority's decision a ``denigration of parental
rights'' and an ``unwarranted judicial intrusion into family
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have accused the high court of dabbling in
``judicial lawmaking'' by deciding issues better resolved by
elected lawmakers, while others believe the SJC is properly
pressuring legislators to address hot-button ``family values''
issues head-on.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of stuff the Legislature would really rather
not have to address because it's inflammatory to particular
constituencies,'' said Boston attorney Peter Zupcofska,
vice-chairman of the Boston Bar Association's family law section.
</P>
<P>
   But Epstein says the court should get credit for taking on
issues the Legislature would just as soon dodge.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at all three decisions together, they send the
message that if the Legislature isn't going to deal with the new
reality of non-traditional families, then the court will,'' she
said.

`SKY PRESERVE' HAS GAZERS SEEING STARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORRANCE BARRENS, Ontario _ To cheers from amateur astronomers,
seekers of starry night romance and other aficionados of the night,
Ontario has decreed a permanent blackout on this 4,900-acre tract
of scrubland on the shores of Lake Muskoka, creating the world's
first ``dark-sky preserve.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is not to protect some rare bat, nocturnal rat, or
night-blooming flower but to guard the sweeping beauty of the
heavens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aim is simply to preserve the view that everyone used to
get from the backyard,'' said Peter Goering, a retired Toronto
architect, amateur astronomer, and one of the prime movers behind
creation of the star park.
</P>
<P>
   The brighter lights of bigger cities have transformed the
post-sundown sky _ at least for most North Americans _ into a pale
imitation of the great spectacle much more widely visible only a
generation or so ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In recent years, the glare of lights has washed the stars from
the sky over too much of Canada and the United States,'' said
Goering, a director of the Muskoka Heritage Foundation, a
preservation group whose members have led the campaign for the
unique star park. ``There are fewer and fewer accessible places
left where the night sky isn't affected by artificial brightness.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course Canada, like the US, has many wilderness realms where
one can see the stars. But they are mostly distant and difficult to
reach. Real patches of darkness close to settled regions are
becoming increasingly rare as outdoor lighting becomes more
brilliant and pervasive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Light pollution is a big problem for amateur astronomers,''
said J. Randy Attwood, president of the Royal Astronomical Society
of Canada. ``The designs of new outdoor lighting send the light up
into the sky. . . What that means is that you cannot look at faint
objects through telescopes if you are in downtown because the light
going up causes a glare.''
</P>
<P>
   But the just-designated star park is not intended as the
exclusive haunt of lense-peering star spotters. The hope, say
supporters, is that it will draw many who simply want to enjoy the
unsullied wonders of the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see the stars, yes, but also the chance to listen to the
insects of the darkness, to hear the whoosh of wings of night
birds,'' said Goering. ``A lot of life carries on under cover of
blackness.''
</P>
<P>
   Torrance Barrens, about 150 miles northeast of Toronto, lies
within easy reach of one of North America's most densely inhabited
regions. With its boulder-strewn flats, scrubby trees, and low
horizons, the barrens are an ideal spot for studying stars through
a telescope or simply marveling at the sparkling panorama of
celestial light visible to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a particularly good place for star-gazing,'' said
Stuart Mallany, heritage specialist with Ontario's Ministry of
Natural Resources, which oversees the reserve. ``The absence of
light pollution in the night skies over the reserve is
remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Although several cities in North America, especially in the
southwest US, have passed regulations to curtail outdoor lighting
around observatories and other sensitive spots, Ontario is the
first jurisdiction to create an official star park.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the Torrance Barrens preserve has drawn
international attention from those who fear that humankind is
literally losing sight of the vast panorama of planets and
constellations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exciting news, a real breakthrough for night-lovers,
Canada is definitely showing the way,'' said Robert Gent, spokesman
for the Arizona-based International Dark-Sky Association, which has
members in 68 countries. ``It's good to know there is now a small
place in Canada set aside for people to gaze in wonder upon the
star-filled infinity of creation, instead of just gawking at the
infinity of McDonald's.''
</P>
<P>
   Designation of the star park _ which does not become official
until completion of a public review that is not expected to draw
any opposition _ comes at a time when many amateur astronomers and
other night sky observers fear they are fighting a losing battle
against flood-lit malls, high-powered security lights, advertising
beacons, and other artificial glare that, dark-sky advocates claim,
is intensifying everywhere in the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Light pollution has come in a great rush over the last few
decades,'' said Gent. ``We're being blinded by the light, losing
our view of the heavens in the glare. In this era, there are
individuals who are born, live, and die without ever having seen
the beauty of the night sky.''
</P>
<P>
   The change is not just in the number of lights but the kinds of
lights. For example, brilliant sodium vapor lights, used on
streets, parking lots, and even as outdoor home security lights,
tend to cast much of their glow upwards, obscuring the view,
instead of simply illuminating the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The Torrance Barrens site is seen as especially well-suited for
a star park because it is bounded to the north by Lake Muskoka and
undeveloped Crown forest _ that is, land owned by the Candian
government. Municipal governments adjoining the barrens to the
south have indicated a willingness to restrict outdoor lighting, at
least within a five-mile swath of the preserve.
</P>
<P>
   The lake-dotted region is famous in Canada as ``cottage
country,'' a hugely popular vacation destination for denizens of
Toronto, much like Cape Cod or the Green Mountains is for people of
urban Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Goering has been summering near the barrens for 47 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really rather strange and unfortunate that even in this
remote district we have to set aside a special area for viewing the
night sky,'' he said. ``But for North Americans, the dark places
are becoming fewer and farther in between.''

DEFINING HILLARY, REALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even in the lazy, hazy daze of summer, the clash was compelling:
Hillary vs. Hillary, a duel between calculated self-presentation
and salacious celebrity titillation.
</P>
<P>
   In Talk, Tina Brown's new magazine, it was Hillary as she wants
to be seen: the aggrieved but understanding wife, sticking by a
tomcatting husband because she believes in their marriage despite
its obvious troubles.
</P>
<P>
   But in ``Bill and Hillary: The Marriage,'' the gossipy new book
by celebrity biographer Chris Andersen, it was an altogether
different Hillary, a Machiavellian mate complicit in many of
Clinton's deceptions, denials, and coverups.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary No. 1 _ call her Sympathetic Hillary _ is a saddened and
suffering, but ultimately forgiving, spouse, a wife with a deep
abiding love for her husband even though he has deceived her, a
woman who has struggled to put her life back together after her
husband's affair with Monica Lewinsky, working through anger and
bitterness to reach understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I survived because of a combination of soul-searching
and relying on friends, the support of people who give advice,
religious faith, long and hard discussions,'' she told Talk in its
initial issue last week. ``You know people have a lot of daily
problems in relationships. Everybody was some dysfunction in their
families. They have to deal with it. You don't just walk away if
you love someone _ you help the person.''
</P>
<P>
   The Talk flashpoint quickly became Hillary's seeming suggestion
that the root cause of her husband's infidelity lay in the
psychological scarring he suffered as a tyke caught in emotional
conflict between mother and grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   That was seemingly news to the president, but welcome news
nonetheless, and his aides spoke approvingly of Mrs. Clinton's
remarks until, faced with incredulity elsewhere, she said her
comments weren't meant to excuse his philandering.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Hillary No. 2, the Hillary of ``Bill and Hillary: The
Marriage,'' which hit bookstores even as Tina's triumph was
becoming the Talk of the town.
</P>
<P>
   Although Andersen's book purports to be ``a uniquely American
love story,'' the Hillary who emerges from its pages is a modern
Lady Macbeth, a cold, calculating, power-hungry figure who has long
known about many of her husband's affairs, but who has helped to
keep them secret or to contain the political harm after public
revelations.
</P>
<P>
   Call her Faustian Hillary. According to this account, Faustian
Hillary shares neither bed nor bedroom with her husband and hasn't
for years. She is a woman, the book suggests, who repaid her
spouse's frenetic philandering by having an affair with Vince
Foster, the late Arkansas friend who became deputy White House
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   This Hillary, Andersen suggests, hired a private detective in
early 1982 to uncover Bill's infidelities _ not to confront her
husband, but to help do damage control during his successful
campaign to retake the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   More troubling still, in Andersen's presentation, Hillary tried
to pressure Juanita Hickey Broaddrick, the Arkansas woman who has
subsequently charged that Bill Clinton raped her in 1978, to keep
quiet about the alleged attack.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mrs. Clinton has vowed to say no more about her
marriage, and her press office says there will be no comment on
Andersen's book, those two images were left vying for primacy in
the public imagination as she experimented with running for the US
Senate from New York. Which Hillary a majority of voters choose to
accept will greatly influence any Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first interpretation makes her much more human, much more
likable,'' said Shirley Glass, a Baltimore clinical psychologist
and marital therapist. ``It is much more somebody we can idenitfy
with. But if they conclude that (the Clinton marriage) is a
Faustian bargain, it makes her very cool and calculating and not
likable, not someone you want to identify with.''
</P>
<P>
   Most seasoned political observers assume that the controlling
first lady had thought long and hard about the results she hoped to
achieve in the Talk interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt in my mind she had carefully figured out
what she was going to say,'' said historian and author Doris Kearns
Goodwin. ``I think she probably thinks it showed her being loyal
and strong and forebearing, which are the traits in the polls that
people are giving her credit for.''
</P>
<P>
   But if ``The Intimate Hillary'' was a coup for Tina Brown and
her new magazine, the result backfired on Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``To bring it all back up strikes me as a real error in
judgment,'' said Goodwin. ``I don't think it was a wise thing to
do, especially to have brought up the presumed reasons for the
infidelity.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the first couple's backpedaling, already their opponents
are chortling, sardonically noting that a problem Mrs. Clinton once
blamed on a ``vast right-wing conspiracy'' is now apparently the
fault of Clinton's mother and grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Further, cultural critic Barbara Dafoe Whitehead, author of
``The Divorce Culture,'' says Mrs. Clinton's efforts to equate her
husband's seemingly frenetic philandering with the problems that
beset average American marriages struck a false note.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people find it hard to identify with her
willingness to tolerate that level of extramarital infidelity,''
said Whitehead. ``It really goes against what most Americans
believe about marriage: that you are monogamous and that it is
mutually binding on both men and women.''
</P>
<P>
   Then add in the venue and timing of the story, which seemed
political and self-serving, a way of ensuring a favorable story on
the eve of a presumed campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I have heard from a lot of people who were borderline
Hillary or favorable to Hillary is that they have gotten more
negative toward her since the Talk piece because they now think she
is just as bad as he is in trying to manipulate them,'' said Debbie
Then, social psychologist and author of ``Women Who Stay With Men
Who Stray.''
</P>
<P>
   Late-week revelations that Mrs. Clinton's family tree includes a
step-grandfather who was Jewish _ information that could help her
in New York _ might well add to that skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if Sympathetic Hillary made a thorough hash of her
attempt to cast her marriage in an understandable light, what of
Andersen's book, which piles troubling tale atop off-putting
anecdote?
</P>
<P>
   Andersen, an erstwhile People magazine senior editor, has made a
living serving up salacious tittle-tattle on celebrities such as
Princess Di, the royal family, and Jack and Jackie Kennedy. His
Jackie, for example, was addicted to speed, suffered from eating
disorders, had affairs both during and after her marriage to JFK,
and was beaten by Aristotle Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen is accustomed to trafficking in tawdriness, in other
words. The problem is, at least as far as Bill Clinton is
concerned, rejecting tawdry stories as unlikely merely because of
the sheer shabbiness of the alleged conduct favors hope over
experience. Still, even if the president has forfeited the benefit
of the doubt, does that necessarily mean it should no longer be
afforded Hillary?
</P>
<P>
   And as far as the new book is concerned, doubt abounds. Andersen
has talked to scores of sources, but some of his assertions are
thinly or ambiguously sourced, and supposition too frequently
supplants proof. Take his suggestion that Hillary pressured
Broaddrick to keep quiet about the sexual assault Broaddrick has
since alleged occurred in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   According to the book, at a Clinton fund-raiser three weeks
after the alleged attack, Hillary pointedly sought Broaddrick out,
took her hand, and thanked her for all she had done for Clinton and
``all you'll keep doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Broaddrick says she tried to pull away, Hillary kept
her hand for a moment longer. ``She was looking me straight in the
eye and I understood perfectly what she'' was ``saying,''
Broaddrick recounts. ``I knew exactly what she meant _ that I was
to keep my mouth shut. That meant that she knew almost from the
beginning _ that he must have confessed at least something to her.
But apparently it was something she was willing to overlook.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one far-reaching ``apparently.'' Unless Broaddrick is
telepathic, to go from a thank you to a supposition of pressure and
thus a presumed knowledge of the alleged rape is to make a rather
large inferential leap. Even Broaddrick has had post-publication
doubts, saying she's really not sure what Hillary knew or meant at
the time of the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen's status as something of a bottom-feeder in the sea of
celebrity is one reason some political experts doubt the new book,
whatever its truths, will seriously hurt Mrs. Clinton. ``I don't
have to accept him as a serious journalist. He writes about
celebrities,'' says Stephen Hess, a senior fellow in governmental
studies at the Brookings Institution. Neither have the media, at
least so far. Instead, Andersen's book has mostly made for light
living stories and gossip column fodder.
</P>
<P>
   A second reason those charges seem unlikely to stick is simpler
still: Chronic Clinton Fatigue Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are really burned out on the personal lives of the
Clintons,'' says Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center
for the People and the Press, who has polled on the issue. ``They
want to move on.'
</P>
<P>
   So, oddly, if Hillary was hurt last week, the damage was mostly
self-inflicted. Which is not to say Sympathetic Hillary has
vanquished her evil-twin image once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   That's a longer struggle. If she does run for the Senate, the
voters should get a better fix on who Hillary, outside the White
House bubble, really is. Only a political magician can hide her
real self over the course of a long campaign. And judging by her
fumble-fingered performance last week, Hillary is no Houdini.
</P>
<P>
   As for the slim chance that a Faustian Hillary could fool New
York into thinking her something she's not? Well, if you can fake
it there, you can fake it anywhere.

WHILE GORE DRAWS CROWDS, BRADLEY DRAWS ENERGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOPKINTON, N.H. _ Two presidential candidates walk down the main
drag of a New Hampshire town to meet the people.
</P>
<P>
   One shakes hands with a random dozen who happen to be out at the
same time, whether they recognize him or not. The other is greeted
by hundreds of potential voters lining the sidewalks three deep for
several blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the difference between Bill Bradley, a former senator,
during a recent trip to Concord and Vice President Al Gore, who
drew crowds in downtown Newport and Portsmouth with no advance
hype, a result of Secret Service strictures.
</P>
<P>
   There are no scientific gauges here in the first-primary state
to determine who is up and who is not six months before any ballots
are cast. In the Democratic contest, supporters of and activists
for both candidates say they are judging momentum less by polls and
endorsements than by gut.
</P>
<P>
   There has been little polling, but the few polls that have been
conducted currently give Gore a Granite State lead. On the
endorsement front, Gore has an unsurprising edge as well. He has
the unofficial backing of the governor, Jeanne Shaheen, 11 of the
13 Democratic senators, more than 100 House Democrats, and a
smattering of mayors, including the upcoming endorsement by the
mayor of Keene, Pat Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, on the other hand, has one Democratic senator in his
camp, one senator leaning toward him, and 18 House Democrats
officially committed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're having more fun,'' said Bradley, after giving a
noontime talk Saturday to about 200 people at the Skyview Cafe and
Brewery in Nashua.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday in Hopkinton, Gore jumped out of his bullet-proof
Suburban and began working a 200-person Democratic picnic, getting
his photo snapped with dozens of supporters under cloudy, spitting
skies. He refused to cede the fun ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels really good here,'' Gore said. ``I think partly
because I'm having fun, I'm having a really good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, the underdog taking on a sitting vice president,
acknowledged to the Nashua crowd that he is trying to approach New
Hampshire ``in a different way.''
</P>
<P>
   During the dead of August, Bradley sent 500 volunteers knocking
on 35,000 doors, dropping off campaign literature. While most
political professionals say it is too early and too many people are
on vacation for that type of tactic, Bradley backers got a charge
out of the effort.
</P>
<P>
   One woman told the candidate that what began as a campaign had
turned into a movement as a result of the canvassing. Bradley said
he is seeing a payoff from his seventh visit to the state this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm operating on the premise that two winters in New Hampshire
are better than one. The meetings are a little bigger now, and
that's a good sign,'' he said. ``It's a day-by-day, week-by-week
exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people who packed the bar of the Skyview on a
perfect summer's day have already committed to Bradley and needed
no persuading by the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I followed his career because my son was a classmate at
Princeton,'' said Betty Gimber. ``I'm supporting him
wholeheartedly.'' Of Gore, she said, ``I don't think he would have
a chance of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Leach said she got to know Bradley from watching him on
C-Span and was particularly impressed with a lecture he delivered
during the impeachment process. ``We need a person who understands
American history and our place in the world,'' she said. ``He's an
influential person who understands how things should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has mixed his nine visits to New Hampshire this year with
talks to hard-core supporters as well as their undecided friends.
Michael J. Donovan, for example, did not know who he would support
before he stood inside a sweltering barn in Etna recently to hear
what the vice president had to say and how he would handle the
varied questions of Donovan's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting a little fascinated with Bill Bradley, who I've
always had a lot of respect for, for years and years in the
Senate,'' said Donovan, the owner of Winged Victory, an educational
tour business that takes students to Washington, New York, and
other cities. ``I'm really not on the fence any longer,'' he said.
``I just thought, it's very clear to me that Al Gore has a grasp of
all the issues in great depth and breadth, and I now think he's the
guy who ought to be the president. He's paid his dues and is on top
of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Verge, the Rockingham County Democratic chairman who backs
Gore, said these visits with the voters are mandatory for a
candidate to win the state. But unlike other Gore backers, Verge is
willing to acknowledge the interest in Bradley and the excitement
that swirls around his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Challengers are always interesting,'' Verge said. ``He's using
an insurgent kind of campaign, attracting some young people to
that. In some ways, watching a challenger is more exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Verge said that Bradley's fund-raising has been impressive and
that he has attracted a thoughtful group of activists to his side,
including Sue Calegari, who once worked for Gary Hart, and John and
Mary Rauh of Sunapee, both former candidates for Congress. He also
said it is easy for people to take potshots at the incumbent vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bradley is doing better than people thought he would
do at this point,'' Verge said. ``There's a little bit of a race.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the star quality of a vice president with a motorcade
and a Secret Service contingent tends to overpower a low-key former
senator who travels with only three aides.
</P>
<P>
   A stop at Madden's ice cream stand in Merrimack on Saturday
yielded several children asking the former Knicks player to
autograph their basketballs, photographers shooting the candidate
as he sloppily stuffed a lobster roll in his mouth, and very few
voters.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Gore was greeted by a raucous crowd of about 200
Democrats in Laconia, long a Republican stronghold. He was also met
by about 10 people protesting a trade policy that hinders the
production of AIDS medication by South African companies. The
protesters blew whistles, threw leaflets, and shouted, interrupting
Gore's speech several times, a frontrunner's burden not shouldered
by Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Monahan, a prominent Democratic lobbyist who once backed Bob
Kerrey of Nebraska, is neutral as he watches the race take shape.
He says there are things he likes and dislikes about both
candidates, though he gives Bradley points for being ``innovative''
and ``aggressive'' with his canvassing effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``For somebody who hasn't made up their mind yet, why do I need
to decide today?'' he asks, observing the fray from a distance.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FALMOUTH, Mass. _ Two decades ago, life started to fall apart
for Elizabeth Pykosz.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, she was 21 and happy, playing bass guitar in a country
band, living a life with few burdens. Then, suddenly and
inexplicably, the happiness drained away, and in its place arose a
tide of depression that no amount of psychiatric treatment, no
combination of psychotropic drugs, nor any of her 10 suicide
attempts could force back down.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what her doctors tried, she just deteriorated. She
tried to keep up with her painting, but she seemed to be losing her
skill at that, too. And she was mystified, with no idea why she had
suddenly sunk so low.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Pykosz, now 42, discovered there was a physical
cause for her illness: Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Though the most common symptoms of Lyme disease _ rashes,
lethargy, joint pain _ are well known by now, the mental effects of
advanced Lyme disease, which some doctors believe include anxiety,
memory loss, depression, obsessive-compulsive behavior, and extreme
aggression, are still a matter of heated contention.
</P>
<P>
   Awareness has grown since the disease, carried by deer ticks and
especially prevalent on Cape Cod and the islands, was first
discovered in the late 1970s. More and more patients are being
correctly diagnosed and treated with antibiotics to kill the
bacteria before it does irreparable damage.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates say those who suffer the mental effects of
advanced Lyme disease have been left behind. Their illness, missed
in its early stages, was allowed to worsen until the infection
reached their brains.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors estimate there are thousands of patients like Pykosz,
suffering crippling psychiatric problems and taking heavy doses of
psychotropic drugs, not knowing that Lyme has caused their illness
or that they might be helped with antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd been diagnosed earlier, all of this could have been
avoided,'' Pykosz said of her years of psychiatric illness. ``I've
gone through an awful lot, and it makes me mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients like Pykosz, say their advocates, are stranded on the
frontier in a war against a disease that is still mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   But they're also caught in a crossfire between those who believe
Lyme disease is widespread and those who believe Lyme disease has
become the disease du jour, overdiagnosed and overtreated with
dangerous doses of antibiotics. While one group of doctors sees a
clear connection between the illness and psychiatric symptoms,
another believes the connection is tenuous at best and that
psychiatrists may be harming mentally ill patients with
antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in all too many cases what's being called psychiatric
disease due to Lyme disease is not and that other forms of
treatment than prolonged antibiotic therapy would be more effective
for these people,'' said Dr. Allen Steere, chief of rheumatology
and director of the Lyme Disease program at New England Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Those who care for Lyme patients with psychiatric symptoms say
Steere refuses to acknowledge a public health crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're starting to learn should be a huge wake-up call to
all mental health professionals,'' said Dr. Paul K. Ling, a
psychologist and advocate for patients with mental symptoms of Lyme
disease. ``Otherwise, a whole lot of needless human suffering will
be the result.''
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors liken the situation to earlier thinking on other
physical illnesses that were first thought to be psychological.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were people in insane asylums who were found to have
thyroid disease and syphilis and lupus,'' said Dr. Sam T. Donta,
professor of medicine at Boston University. ``History tells us
there are causes for these illnesses. They're not due to evil
spirits.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg, who asked that his last name not be used, grew up near
Lyme, Conn., the town for which the disease is named. He said he
had battled mental illness since childhood, but that his problems
worsened a decade ago, when he became a stockbroker. He was
diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but he also complained of
exhaustion and joint pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever questioned my diagnosis; no one ever tested me for
anything physical. It's amazing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, he tested positive for Lyme disease. If he
had been correctly diagnosed earlier, Greg said, his illness would
have been ``a bump in the road of this life, instead of going off a
cliff.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he conceded that he still feels paranoid, Greg said he
has been much improved since he stopped other medications, opting
for antibiotics alone. He now holds a part-time job doing
maintenance work.
</P>
<P>
   Pykosz said that since she began antibiotic treatment for her
illness and jettisoned her other medications _ at one point she was
taking 14 medications a day _ she has been vastly improved. She
said she doesn't think of suicide any more, and her paintings,
which years ago hung in several Cape galleries, are finding
showings once more.
</P>
<P>
   Both Pykosz and Greg have medical charts as thick as phone books
and have taken a long succession of drugs that, they say, left them
in a permanent fog. They also lived with the stigma of mental
illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have people around you shamed by your mental state, and
then to find it's a physical thing, it's very liberating,'' Greg
said. ``It's so much easier to accept the fact that some parasite
made me ill. It gives me a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody can say how many other patients like them there might be.
According to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, more
than 700 cases of Lyme disease were reported last year, but
advocates say that figure is far short of the actual number, since
some people carry the disease without knowing it and not all
patients who have it test positive using the current tests.
</P>
<P>
   Some psychiatrists say the number of Lyme patients with mental
symptoms runs into the thousands: Dr. Robert Bransfield, a
psychiatrist and associate director of the Riverview Medical Center
in Red Bank, N.J., another Lyme hot spot, said he has seen a
thousand of them.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates argue that there should be an aggressive public
awareness campaign to educate doctors and the public about the
hidden side of Lyme disease. Ling and his colleages also want the
state Department of Mental Health to start screening its clients.
Blood tests for the disease cost less than $100, but brain scans,
which some psychiatrists say are more reliable, cost more than
$2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Others say that is alarmist.
</P>
<P>
   Steere, who first named the disease in 1978, does not see such
strong connections between the disease and mental illness. He will
go only so far as to say that Lyme disease can give rise to ``a
subtle neuropsychiatric picture in which subtle memory deficit is
the most common manifestation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what has been described as Lyme disease, and
attributed to Lyme disease, would not stand up to the scrutiny'' of
peer review, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it's a debate without clear answers, and the
argument promises to stretch on for years.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, advocates say, patients like Pykosz will get lost in
the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they're filling up mental institutions,'' said
Donta. ``But there are more ordinary people who are walking around
who have those symptoms and have gotten themselves in a vicious
downward spiral and have just accepted that it's their lot to be
depressed.''

TURNING BACK THE CLOCK IN THE CALIFORNIA HILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLUMAS NATIONAL FOREST, Calif. _ Plenty of people wish they
could turn the years back to an earlier time, like the days of the
frontier, of Joe Walker, Kit Carson and Jim Bridger.
</P>
<P>
   Two fellows in the Sierra foothills do exactly that almost every
weekend. Their names are Ron Stover and Bill Clemons, who have
created Swamp Creek Outfitters and Guide Service, which specializes
in setting up camps and adventures modeled after the era of the
1830s and the Rocky Mountain fur trade.
</P>
<P>
   To get the picture, they set up everything, plan all the
adventures for the campers they host. At the same time, if you try
packing anything modern, such as a radio, flashlight or an item
made out of plastic or nylon, well, ``We tell them to keep it out
of our sight,'' Stover said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in our camp, including our ice chest, is dated for
1830s or earlier,'' Stover said. ``Not many people do this kind of
thing and it's become a dying piece of history. Our goal is try and
teach kids and adults about the outdoors, to capture some of the
lost skills.''
</P>
<P>
   On this weekend trip, Stover and Clemons have set up a camp at
Long Lake in remote Plumas National Forest, which can be reached
with an extremely rugged 4-wheeler or a 5-mile hike, one way. If
you were to visit you would discover a camp that looks like a scene
out of ``Jeremiah Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   It is like an artist's painting of a camp from the 1830s. From a
distance, the first thing you'd spot is what appears to be a small
Indian encampment, with two teepees, a one-pole tent (resembles a
pyramid), and a wedge tent (shaped like inverted V, popular in the
Civil War and for hundreds of year before that).
</P>
<P>
   As you get closer, you will see the signs of recent activity,
furs, deer-hide bags, traps (not set, of course) and for music, a
drum and a flute, and Stover and Clemons will likely be
demonstrating woodsmanship skills of the time period. That might
include shooting bows and arrows, flintlock muzzleloaders, how to
start a campfire with flint and steel, how to tan hides, and how to
set up a weather-resistant camp with nothing more than Carson had,
a tarp and a blanket.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always try to go to primitive areas that best recapture the
period,'' Stover said. ``That means extremely remote and beautiful
places with unfished streams.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the adventure is learning the respect of nature and
safety in all applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the woods out fishing, camping or hunting 200 days a
year,'' Stover said. ``It's not our job, but we take people out as
often as we can, which ends up a few weekends a month. What we do
is outfit people to come and do this, and then share the ways of
the mountain man.''
</P>
<P>
   As in the 1830s, many mountain men went by nicknames, such as
Liver-Eating Johnson and Hatchet Jack. So do Stover and Clemons.
</P>
<P>
   Stover goes by ``K.B.'' because he's the head cook, and Clemons
by Broken Drum because, right, he broke his drum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were having fun one night, watching the stars and banging
on the drum, while people were dancing around the campfire, hooting
and hollering,'' Clemons said. ``I was having so much fun that when
I hit it with the drum beater, it went right through skin.''
</P>
<P>
   As the story goes, Clemons stared at his drum, and spoke the
obvious in disbelief, ``I broke my drum,'' and a nickname was born.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these fellows fits the part. At camp, they dress in
leather buckskins, and Clemons always wears a beaver felt hat. They
are also big guys, over 250 pounds, and Clemons has a
neatly-trimmed beard.
</P>
<P>
   No one else is offering trips like this to the public in
California. The experience generates close bonding between family
members, memories of a lifetime, and a chance to relive history.
</P>
<P>
   For a camping/trapping expedition, four days and three nights,
the cost is $525 and includes having your camp outfitted, including
all equipment, food and cooking provided, along with guide service;
photographic hunts and a variety of discounts are also available.
The trapping is educational, which means no animals are taken.

HITCHCOCK WAS A MASTER OF CONTRADICTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
  
LOS ANGELES _ Much has been said about Alfred Hitchcock, most
eloquently by Hitchcock himself.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``. . . The whole art of the motion picture is a succession of
composed images, rapidly going through a machine, creating ideas,''
he said in a 1966 interview.
</P>
<P>
   And in that same conversation, ``After all, the most enjoyable
part of making a picture is in that little office, with the writer,
when we are discussing the story lines and what we're going to put
on the screen, searching for freshness and so forth, and also
always that lovely moment when we say, `Wouldn't it be fun to kill
him this way.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And to Peter Bogdanovich, when he asked if Hitch ever thought of
posterity, ``What did posterity ever do for me?''
</P>
<P>
   As we approach the 100th anniversary of Hitchcock's birth,
Friday the 13th, posterity still owes him an effort. Hitchcock's
life didn't just parallel the century of cinema; his artistry
defined and refined the medium more than any other director's.
</P>
<P>
   Master of Suspense, master showman, tireless innovator, pantheon
auteur, world's drollest TV host _ the accolades have been many.
</P>
<P>
   Early feminist (his scripts were vetted and worked out with his
wife, Alma Reville, whose vital contributions he always
acknowledged), twisted misogynist (what was he working out on all
those cool blond actresses?), gracious collaborator, control freak,
disdainful of actors, admittedly dependent on the best of them,
manipulative mass-entertainer, critical darling _ the
contradictions were even more numerous, and fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   You could joke that Hitchcock contained everything the movies
could and would become in one jumbo-sized frame and still be
completely accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he understand how film grammar spoke to an audience
better than anyone else of his era (and, except perhaps for Steven
Spielberg, anyone who's come along since), he made it speak his
language, as formal and controlled as his trademark ``Good
eee-vening'' greeting, and just as loaded with sardonic mirth and
pregnant menace.
</P>
<P>
   The style with which Hitchcock unnerved moviegoers for 50 years
was the unexpectedly happy result of influences that are usually
considered traumatic: Catholic guilt, rigorous Jesuit education,
English repression, judiciously sadistic parenting.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock downplayed, but never denied, the influence of that
infamous formative moment when his father, a London grocer, sent
5-year-old Alfred to the police station with a note requesting that
the child be locked in a cell to teach him what happens to naughty
boys. The thematic obsessions that ran rampant throughout his
mature body of work _ mistaken identity, intimate betrayal,
persecution of innocents, transferal of guilt _ suggest that he
never got over it.
</P>
<P>
   Those rich ideas and others like them were subsidiary to
Hitchcock's grandest theme of all: that to be human is to be a
voyeur, to desire a glimpse of the private, the dangerous, the
exciting and the taboo. Which, of course, is what anybody who
watches a movie does.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock married the urge to look with a presentational genius
and technical imagination (he originally was trained to be an
electrical engineer) that led to constant advancement of the motion
picture art form. Here's a list of breakthroughs, terribly
incomplete because, heck, who can count them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lodger'' (1926), Hitchcock's third feature, first thriller
and initial box-office success, featured a shot of the title
character, suspected of being Jack the Ripper, pacing above a
see-through glass floor, chillingly evoking the downstairs
neighbors' need to know what was up with this guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 39 Steps''' (1935) represented the full flowering of
everything we associate with Hitchcock _ all of the aforementioned
themes plus breakneck (for then) chase action, seamless blending of
comedy and suspense, perverse sexual implications (that reluctantly
_ or are they? _ handcuffed couple), sophisticated sound-picture
cutting and the introduction of the MacGuffin, the red herring
characters in the film care a lot about, but the audience doesn't
too much.
</P>
<P>
   The MacGuffin was sort of an inverse application of Hitchcock's
first law of movie suspense: Show the audience a threat before the
characters know about it. No more effective principle of film
storytelling has ever been devised.
</P>
<P>
   After coming to America in 1939 and fighting the interference of
his U.S. sponsor, producer David O. Selznick, Hitchcock set about
exploring the dramatic possibilities of his expansive new
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saboteur's'' (1942) famous Statue of Liberty climax showed how
he could turn reassuring landmarks into stark, unfamiliar places of
dread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shadow of a Doubt'' (1943), the first American masterpiece,
with Joseph Cotten as the template for many aberrant killers to
come, also exposed gleeful morbidity and unhealthy identification
in wholesome, smalltown USA.
</P>
<P>
   A series of experiments with the possibilities of limited space
(``Lifeboat''), Dali-designed surrealism (``Spellbound'') and
extended takes (``Rope'') occupied the restless formal pioneer
through the latter half of the '40s, and not entirely successfully.
Indeed, Hitchcock's most impressive technical coup in the immediate
postwar films is ``Notorious''' elaborate, space-contracting crane
shot from a second floor landing down to a key clutched in Ingrid
Bergman's hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notorious''' superb blend of narrative, character and
cinematic virtues presaged the decade of masterworks that ran from
1951 to 1960. Limited space demands that we reductively describe
``Strangers on a Train,'' ``To Catch a Thief'' and ``North by
Northwest'' with the same single word: perfect.
</P>
<P>
   We'll also note that the less-than-perfect ``Dial M for Murder''
(still the only 3-D feature that did anything with the process),
``The Trouble With Harry,'' the remake of ``The Man Who Knew Too
Much'' and ``The Wrong Man'' had more great moviemaking spread
among them than any given decade's worth of best picture Oscar
winners.
</P>
<P>
   And then there were The Three: ``Rear Window'' (1954),
``Vertigo'' (1958) and ``Psycho'' (1960) showed us everything that
movies were capable of and taught us everything they meant.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock liked to call ``Rear Window'' _ a story about lenses
and peeping and projecting and suddenly, horribly discovering that
what's safely intriguing to watch from a distance is no such fun
when it comes physically or emotionally close _ his most purely
cinematic work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vertigo'' was the directors' story. In James Stewart's
compulsive need to re-create the woman he lost in someone else, the
filmmaker's drive to express something vital with the tools of
illusions is distilled to its poignant essence. And when the
manipulative creator discovers that even he's being had by a rich,
unscrupulous employer, volumes more are implied about the artist's
predicament in studio Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   By ``Psycho,'' Hitchcock had achieved such a command of both
film language and pop movie conventions that he literally could
rewrite all the rules in 109 minutes of screen time. Kill the star
halfway through? Naked, in a shower? With a schizophrenic
transvestite? Unheard of, yet Hitch knew instinctively how every
untested, unexpected turn would affect the audience.
</P>
<P>
   This, perhaps more than ``Vertigo,'' is Hitchcock's testament to
what really drives the true filmmaker, the power to move viewers in
ways only he knows how to.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, directors have been abusing the lessons learned
from ``Psycho'' ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this furious creative achievement was made while
Hitchcock was also busy producing, sometimes directing and always
amusingly hosting one of the best television anthologies ever
broadcast. As great a ham as he was an artist _ or, more likely,
well aware that in the growing culture of personality the movies
initiated, celebrity enhanced his power _ Hitchcock became as
familiar to the general public as ``Hitchcockian'' had become a
common adjective for a certain style of filmmaking. Once again, no
other movie director has been so well-recognized in either way.
</P>
<P>
   There were two more influential advances in the '60s, the
special-effects extravaganza ``The Birds,'' and ``Marnie,'' which
opened up still deeper, more complex Freudian territory to American
film. ``Torn Curtain'' (1966), the project most consider the
beginning of the aging genius's final decline, shrewdly offers
something of an auto-eulogy _ in moving pictures, of course. When
Paul Newman discovers that killing a Communist agent with a
kitchen's available implements is no simple task, it's as if
Hitchcock was telling us what he'd made look so slickly effortless
for so long had gotten much more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   As well as, of course, admitting that it was all a big, sardonic
lie called the movies.
</P>
<P>
   A lie that it was clearly the joy of his life to tell over and
over, better and better, until it imparted profound truth.
Throughout his prolific, accomplished and wildly popular career,
Hitchcock shrugged off suggestions that he was a great artist.
Indeed, when a frazzled Bergman came to him for moral support when
she was having trouble with another director, she already knew what
Hitch's unsatisfactory advice would be: Relax, Ingrid, it's only a
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the man who could dismiss his life's work with such
poker-faced aplomb wrote, in 1937, these very well-reasoned yet
heartbreaking words: ``Films suffer from their own power of
appealing to millions. They could often be subtler than they are,
but their own popularity won't let them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock's subtler creative notions were often frustrated by
his own, nonpareil ability to master film's power and appeal to
millions. If posterity can do anything for Alfred Hitchcock, it
might be to forget all the lesser labels and remember him purely as
an artist.

BOY SCOUTS NEED TO ALTER GAY POLICY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JACK Z. SMITH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Jersey's Supreme Court made a gutsy, highly controversial
decision this past week when it ruled that the Boy Scouts of
America cannot exclude gays from its organization.
</P>
<P>
   The legal arguments in the case are complicated. They revolve
around whether the BSA is a sufficiently public and broad-based
organization to fall under New Jersey's Law Against Discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not a lawyer. I don't know how the U.S. Supreme Court will
rule if it agrees to hear an appeal of the New Jersey case that the
BSA, based in Irving, Texas, is expected to file.
</P>
<P>
   I know, however, that I'm weary of seeing people being
discriminated against, ridiculed or excluded from organizations
merely because they are gay.
</P>
<P>
   In the Jersey case, the court ruled unanimously that James Dale,
29, a former assistant scoutmaster and Eagle Scout, was improperly
kicked out of the Boy Scouts when he was 19 because he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   I was cheered by the compassionate sentiments expressed by the
Jersey court in its ruling, as well as by the reaction of the
state's Republican governor, Christie Whitman, to the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The court's chief justice, Deborah Poritz, compared Dale's
struggle for fair and equal treatment to those of women and
minorities against bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad truth is that excluded groups and individuals have
been prevented from full participation in the social, economic and
political life of our country,'' Poritz wrote. ``The human price of
this bigotry has been enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   A person's sexual preference should be a private matter, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the troop leader is a good leader, there is no reason to
worry about his sexual preferences,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The court said the BSA constitutes a ``public accommodation''
under the Jersey law in that it historically has had a broad-based
membership and has traditionally partnered with various public
entities.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, the court said the Boy Scouts have had local
membership drives that include ``School Nights'' conducted in
public schools. It also cites the Scouts' longtime close ties to
the military and their use of military facilities. The court noted
that many fire and police agencies have helped sponsor scouting
units.
</P>
<P>
   The BSA contends it is a private organization that has the right
to establish its own membership and leadership standards. After the
Jersey court's ruling, BSA spokesman John Holland said, ``The
Scouts are committed to upholding traditional values, and we do not
believe avowed homosexuals can serve as role models for the Scout
oath and law.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey court's ruling currently affects only that state.
But if the U.S. Supreme Court were to rule in an appeal of the
case, there could be nationwide implications.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether the BSA has a legal right to exclude gays,
it should voluntarily end its discriminatory exclusion of them.
People such as Dale, who apparently was an exemplary Boy Scout,
shouldn't be booted out of the organization just because they have
a sexual orientation different from that of the majority of
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Jersey court called membership in the BSA ``an American
tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   One of America's greatest traditions is to be tolerant of
differences in people.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think gay people ``choose'' their sexual orientation,
any more than heterosexual people ``choose'' theirs. When it comes
to sexual orientation, some people just naturally lean one way and
some the other.
</P>
<P>
   When you consider the ridicule, physical violence, social
ostracism, rejection by family members and discrimination that many
gay people suffer, why would anyone think that they willfully
``choose'' to be gay?
</P>
<P>
   I would like to see a federal law passed to outlaw
discrimination against gays in hiring, housing and public
accommodations such as hotels and restaurants. Some states and
cities already have such laws.
</P>
<P>
   Already there are federal, state and local laws on the books
that outlaw discrimination against people based on their race,
gender, religion, national origin and disability. Sexual
orientation should be added to that list. That would mean you
couldn't fire people, refuse to rent an apartment to them or bar
them from a restaurant merely because they are homosexual,
heterosexual or bisexual.
</P>
<P>
   I think it's a genuine legal question as to whether the Boy
Scouts should be subject to anti-discrimination laws such as the
New Jersey statute.
</P>
<P>
   But I would hope that the organization of which I was a proud
member as a boy will see fit to change its outdated, exclusionary
policy toward gays.

<P>
   Of all the triumphs that have marked this as America's century _
breathtaking advances in science and technology, the
democratization of wealth and dispersal of political power in ways
hardly imaginable in 1899 _ none is more inspiring, if incomplete,
than our pursuit of racial justice.
</P>
<P>
   The milestones include Theodore Roosevelt's inviting Booker T.
Washington to dine at the White House, Harry Truman's desegregating
the armed forces, Dwight Eisenhower's using federal troops to
integrate Little Rock's Central High School and Lyndon Johnson's
electrifying the nation by standing before Congress in 1965 and
declaring, ``We shall overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   I came by my support of that year's Voting Rights Act naturally.
Thirty years before Selma, I was a University of Michigan senior,
preparing with my Wolverine teammates for a football game against
visiting Georgia Tech. Among the best players on that year's
Michigan squad was Willis Ward, a close friend of mine whom the
Southern school reputedly wanted dropped from our roster because he
was black. My classmates were just as adamant that he should take
the field. In the end, Willis decided on his own not to play.
</P>
<P>
   His sacrifice led me to question how educational administrators
could capitulate to raw prejudice. A university, after all, is both
a preserver of tradition and a hotbed of innovation. So long as
books are kept open, we tell ourselves, minds can never be closed.
</P>
<P>
   But doors, too, must be kept open. Tolerance, breadth of mind
and appreciation for the world beyond our neighborhoods: these can
be learned on the football field and in the science lab as well as
in the lecture hall. But only if students are exposed to America in
all her variety.
</P>
<P>
   For the class of '35, such educational opportunities were
diminished by the relative scarcity of African-Americans, women and
various ethnic groups on campus. I have often wondered how
different the world might have been in the 1940s, '50s and '60s _
how much more humane and just _ if my generation had experienced a
more representative sampling of the American family. That the
indignities visited on Willis Ward would be unimaginable in today's
Ann Arbor is a measure of how far we have come toward realizing,
however belatedly, the promises we made to each other in declaring
our nationhood and professing our love of liberty.
</P>
<P>
   And yet. In the last speech of his life, Lyndon Johnson reminded
us of how much unfinished work remained. ``To be black in a white
society is not to stand on level and equal ground,'' he said.
``While the races may stand side by side, whites stand on history's
mountain and blacks stand in history's hollow. Until we overcome
unequal history, we cannot overcome unequal opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Like so many phrases that have become political buzzwords,
affirmative action means different things to different people.
Practically speaking, it runs the gamut from mandatory quotas,
which the Supreme Court has ruled are clearly unconstitutional, to
mere lip service, which is just as clearly unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   At its core, affirmative action should try to offset past
injustices by fashioning a campus population more truly reflective
of modern America and our hopes for the future. Unfortunately, a
pair of lawsuits brought against my alma mater pose a threat to
such diversity. Not content to oppose formal quotas, plaintiffs
suing the University of Michigan would prohibit that and other
universities from even considering race as one of many factors
weighed by admission counselors.
</P>
<P>
   So drastic a ban would scuttle Michigan's current system, one
that takes into account nearly a dozen elements _ race, economic
standing, geographic origin, athletic and artistic achievement
among them _ to create the finest educational environment for all
students.
</P>
<P>
   This eminently reasonable approach, as thoughtful as it is fair,
has produced a student body with a significant minority component
whose record of academic success is outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Times of change are times of challenge. It is estimated that by
2030, 40 percent of all Americans will belong to various racial
minorities. Already the global economy requires unprecedented grasp
of diverse viewpoints and cultural traditions. I don't want future
college students to suffer the cultural and social impoverishment
that afflicted my generation. If history has taught us anything in
this remarkable century, it is the notion of America as a work in
progress. Do we really want to risk turning back the clock to an
era when the Willis Wards were isolated and penalized for the color
of their skin, their economic standing or national ancestry?
</P>
<P>
   To eliminate a constitutional affirmative action policy would
mock the inclusive vision Carl Sandburg had in mind when he wrote:
``The Republic is a dream. Nothing happens unless first a dream.''
Lest we forget: America remains a nation with have-nots as well as
haves. Its government is obligated to provide for hope no less than
for the common defense.

   SCI-YUCCA-NUKE (Undated) _ Scientists ponder the suitability of
the nation's burial group, Yucca Mountain, for its most deadly
radioactive waste. By Jon Christenson. (1800 words)

<P>
   SCI-GOD-PARTICLE (Undated) _ The race to find an elusive but
all-important particle called the Higgs boson heated up last week
when Europe's most powerful accelerator reached an energy that may
bring the target within range. Because of its presumably vital
importance to universal existence, the Higgs boson was dubbed ``The
God Particle'' in the title of a book by Dr. Leon Lederman, a Nobel
laureate in physics. The god-like importance ascribed to the Higgs
is based on the belief that it endows all the constituents of
matter with mass; it is the universal giver of heft. By Malcolm W.
Browne. (800 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DOOMSDAY (Undated) _ Amid the summer news doldrums, what
could be more invigorating than a warning that physicists may be on
the verge of destroying the world? Luckily, this and similar alarms
can be taken with a large grain of salt, and viewed in the proper
light, disaster warnings can be fun. The idea that human beings
could actually obliterate their planet may be scary, but like a
roller-coaster ride, it is thrilling. Even in the face of doomsday
speculation, most reasonable people are pretty sure that the global
roller coaster will stay on the track despite the hair-raising
ride. By Malcolm W. Browne. (1300 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PLUTO (Undated) _ Two telescopes in Hawaii have seen beyond
previous limits of visibility to make intriguing discoveries about
the surface composition of the planet Pluto and Saturn's largest
satellite, Titan. One telescope revealed the existence of the
hydrocarbon ethane on Pluto's surface, potentially significant
because it may be a remnant component of the original interstellar
gas cloud that collapsed to form the solar system. Another
telescope detected what may be liquid or frozen seas of
hydrocarbons on Titan, which could be the only ones known in the
solar system other than those on Earth. By John Noble Wilford.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ECLIPSE (Undated) _ The solar eclipse that will sweep across
Europe, the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent on Wednesday
promises to be one of the most watched in history. By Henry
Fountain.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items on
ocelots' reaction to Obsession, parrots that eat clay and robot
championships. By Henry fountain. (690 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column: The
insulin pump is changing the lives of more than 50,000 people who
are now using it. And many more could easily use it. By Jane E.
Brody. (1350 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VIAGRA-WOMEN (Undated) _ A small study shows that women
taking antidepressants can overcome the side effects affecting
their sex lives with doses of Viagra an hour before encounters. By
Anne Eisenberg. (500 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BULLIES (Undated) _ When bullies and victims are the same
people. By Susan Gilbert. (1000 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HOSPITAL-RISK (Undated) _ Hospital patients often subject
themselves to risk just by being in a hospital, where mistakes
often happen. By Sandeep Juahar, M.D. (1150 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SHAPE-RECOGNITION (Undated) _ Scientists have long assumed
that people must see shape in the same way at all sizes. Otherwise,
they would recognize friends or the letter ``a'' differently at
each distance or size. Yet the artist Chuck Close is exhibiting
paintings that refute this assumption, showing that size can
dramatically affect what shape we see. By Denis Pelli. (800 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FITNESS-WEIGHTS (Undated) _ Lightweight, high-speed
weight-training techniques now are being recommended as a part of
essential training for serious and recreational athletes alike. By

</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ Optimism and self-confidence may prove to be potent weapons in
staving off a recurrence of heart disease, if a new study by
Carnegie Mellon researchers is any indication. Patients in the
study who evidenced a positive outlook, greater self-control and
higher self-esteem after angioplasty surgery were less likely to
suffer a heart attack, undergo bypass surgery, or require a second
angioplasty in the next six months. (265 words)

`PATIENTS' KEEP ARRIVING AT SANCTUARY FOR ABUSED FARM ANIMALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REBEKAH DENN

<TEXT>
<P>
   SULTAN, Wash. _ On some days, Susan Michaels fields as many as
80 calls.
</P>
<P>
   One caller has a tip on six ducks shot by blow darts in Kent.
</P>
<P>
   Another wonders whether her sanctuary can take two sick pygmy
goats found dumped in Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   A third has another problem: An abandoned rooster needs a home.
</P>
<P>
   Such is life at Pasado's Safe Haven.
</P>
<P>
   The animal sanctuary, the first in the Pacific Northwest for
abused and neglected farm animals, celebrated its first anniversary
this past weekend with an open house and a ``Bow-Wow Bash'' for the
hundreds of volunteers who make it all possible.
</P>
<P>
   In the year since it's opening, the haven, named in memory of a
donkey beaten and strangled at a Bellevue park in 1992, has taken
in hundreds of animals that had been starved, abandoned and shot.
</P>
<P>
   They include 200 rabbits, 45 chickens, two cows, two donkeys,
two turkeys, two pigs, three goats, six dogs, 28 cats and one
three-legged sheep.
</P>
<P>
   There's Tommy the longhorn calf, favoring one side as he walks
with four bullet wounds inflicted by teenage tormenters.
</P>
<P>
   There's Hope, the sickly Holstein calf who was slurping from a
bottle when the shelter opened last year. Since then, she's grown
into a sturdy 1,500-pound teenager of a cow.
</P>
<P>
   And there's Lucille the pink pig, who was being auctioned as a
breeder sow. On this day, she wags her tufted tail as Michaels, who
founded the sanctuary with her husband, rubs Lucille's stomach and
feeds her carrots.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctuary, says Richard Huffman, of the Lynnwood-based
Progressive Animal Welfare Society, has helped fill a void in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   PAWS operates shelters for domestic and wild animals, but not
for farm animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole other subgroup of animals that just kind of
falls through the cracks ... and that's where Susan comes in,''
Huffman said.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctuary takes in the animals, rehabilitates them, and, in
many cases, finds them new homes.
</P>
<P>
   But Michaels' other role has been as a savvy promoter of animal
welfare. She's made the sanctuary a prominent voice, whether
offering rewards in animal cruelty cases, educating school classes
who regularly visit the sanctuary classrooms or sponsoring events,
such as a vegan Thanksgiving where the turkey guests were gobbling
as loudly as the humans.
</P>
<P>
   One of her proudest achievements this year was convincing the
Highline School District south of Seattle to remove a
chick-hatching project from the science kits it distributed
throughout area schools.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the animals at the sanctuary has a name, part of a
conscious effort by Michaels and her husband, Mark Steinway, to
present the animals as individuals rather than producers of milk
and meat.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the sanctuary came to Michaels after she helped
lobby for tougher animal cruelty laws in the wake of Pasado's
death.
</P>
<P>
   A former TV personality who later owned women's formalwear
shops, she sold her businesses, sold her Bellevue home and bought
25 acres of land near Sultan, in Snohomish County about 30 miles
northeast of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctuary has no paid staff. It gets by with a combination
of Steinway's salary as a video editor and the goodwill army of
volunteers who donate food, labor and materials.
</P>
<P>
   Veterinary costs are their main expense, Steinway said.
</P>
<P>
   Bins of produce from the homegrocer.com warehouse are a regular
boon _ especially for the 200-odd rabbits rescued from a Redmond
development.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 people each month stop in for work parties to build
fences and stalls, plant apple trees for the animals' future treats
and dig ditches.
</P>
<P>
   A new barn, paid for with a $30,000 grant through the Northwest
Animal Rights Network, will be dedicated today, a rooster weather
vane proudly turning overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Less-visible but no less significant are the off-site
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   A Rolodex in Michaels' office has a fat section of cards under R
for ``rescue,'' with a network of area residents willing to take in
animals after they've been rehabilitated at the haven.
</P>
<P>
   Bellevue residents Joanne and Brendan Brannen joined after they
heard about the haven through an in-house e-mail when Joanne
Brannen worked at Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Former ``dog and cat people,'' they now have two goats, two
sheep, a rooster and chickens on their fenced Bellevue property.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Brannen said she made the commitment after meeting Hope
the calf on a visit to the haven.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just feeding that animal with a bottle, it was amazing,'' she
said. ``It was no different than a dog and a cat, and yet the
treatment is so different.'' The Brannens now plan to buy a larger
property near the haven to allow them to take in more animals.
Another couple has already bought 15 nearby acres for the same
purpose.

starting with what is considered his breakthrough film, ``The
Lodger,'' a story of Jack the Ripper. Titles with slashes indicate

the slash. ``Sabotage,'' for instance, was released as ``A Woman
Alone'' in the United States, though today it is known by its
British title.

   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Whatever moved the action along in a film was
called a MacGuffin by Hitchcock. But what's a MacGuffin? Here's
Hitchcock's explanation:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called the MacGuffin because ... the story goes that two
men are in the train. And one sitting across from the other says,
`Excuse me sir, what is that strange-looking package above your
head?'''
</P>
<P>
   And the other man says, `Oh, that's a MacGuffin.'
</P>
<P>
   And the first one asks, `What's it for?'
</P>
<P>
   `Well,' the other man says, `it's for tracking lions in the
Scottish Highlands.'
</P>
<P>
   And the first man says, `But there are no lions in the Scottish
Highlands.'
</P>
<P>
   And the other man says, `Well then, that's no MacGuffin!'
</P>
<P>
   ``The MacGuffin is nothing, really. It's like a painter,
worrying whether the apples in the painting are sweet or sour. Who
cares? It's his style, his manner of painting. That's where the
emotion comes from. It's for the artist to interpret in his own way
and thus create an emotion. Literature can do it by the way the
words are put together, but sometimes you find that a film is
looked at solely for its content _ without any regard for the style
or manner in which the story is told. And basically that is the art
of the cinema.'' &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Alfred Hitchcock's cameos in his movies began out
of necessity. In order to fill out some scenes in his 1926 film
``The Lodger,'' he cast himself as an extra. Hitch didn't have
cameos in all of his films, notably ``Suspicion'' (1941), ``The Man
Who Knew Too Much'' (1934), ``Jamaica Inn'' (1939) and ``Secret
Agent'' (1936). In ``The Wrong Man'' (1957), he didn't make a cameo
but did introduce the film. In later films, when the cameo was
expected, he would make his presence known early so the audience
wouldn't be distracted looking for him, but that wasn't always the
case. In 1946's ``Notorious'' he appeared halfway through the film.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the films Hitch made cameos in and where you can find
him:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lodger'' (1926): First of the famous cameo roles, and you
get twice as much of him _ first you see him seated at a desk in a
newsroom, and later, wearing a cap and leaning against a railing,
he's one of the bystanders watching the arrest of Ivor Novello.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blackmail'' (1929): Bothered by a little boy while trying to
read a book on the subway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murder!'' (1930): Passer-by on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 39 Steps'' (1935): Passer-by on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young and Innocent'' (1937): One of his longer appearances
(about 20 seconds) as a clumsy press photographer taking a photo of
the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lady Vanishes'' (1938): Smoking a cigarette in a London
railway station.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rebecca'' (1940): Standing outside a phone booth while George
Sanders makes a call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foreign Correspondent'' (1940): Reading a newspaper on the
street, just before Joel McCrea meets Van Meer (Albert Basserman).

   LOS ANGELES _ Alfred Hitchcock always wanted to be taken
seriously as an artist, but critical acclaim often eluded the
``Master of Suspense.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, a year before his death, he received the American Film
Institute's Life Achievement Award and gave a moving speech
thanking his wife and longtime collaborator, Alma.
</P>
<P>
   Winning an Oscar was another matter. Hitchcock was nominated for
five Academy Awards as best director _ for ``Rebecca'' (1940),
``Lifeboat'' (1944), ``Spellbound'' (1945), ``Rear Window'' (1954)
and ``Psycho'' (1960) _ but never won.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, the director was presented with the Irving G.
Thalberg Memorial Award in 1967, which is given to ``creative''
producers for their body of work. Hitchcock's acceptance speech was
a terse two words: ``Thank you.'' &QL;

PRE-PAID CELLPHONE CARDS STARTING TO CONNECT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN AND BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We thought we'd discovered all the good cellular phone deals
until we got an e-mail last week from Tom Metro, a computer
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   He asked us why we never wrote about pre-paid cell phone cards
as a low-cost way for skeptics to try wireless phone service. Metro
had been shopping around for a plan for his elderly mother, who
wants a cell phone for emergencies only. He found a Cellular One
pre-paid analog plan for $90 that includes 120 minutes and lasts an
entire year.
</P>
<P>
   Though the cost for each minute is a hefty 75 cents, this plan's
one-year $90 cost compares favorably to most standard monthly plans
that cost at least $200 a year. And the offer lasts a year, while
most pre-paid minutes expire in 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   With analog handsets so cheap these days (maybe even free if you
can find someone who has abandoned an analog handset after
converting to a digital phone), this pre-paid option struck Metro
as a smart solution for a safety-oriented user.
</P>
<P>
   He's right. And he's also onto a new trend in the wireless
world: promoting pre-paid cards not only to serve those who don't
financially qualify for standard contracts, but to first-timers or
transient folks who don't want big commitments or monthly bills.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless analysts say companies in New York, Miami, and
Philadelphia have already slashed prices on pre-paid cards and
sweetened the terms to attract a wide mix of consumers. Some
discount resellers are getting into the act there as well.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, the pre-paid cellular phone market is just starting
to heat up. AT&AMP;T Wireless has yet to offer any pre-paid cards here,
but other major carriers have begun lowering prices and tinkering
with terms of their pre-paid cards.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Thigpen, vice president and general manager of pre-paid
services for Boston Communications Group in Woburn, Mass., which
runs pre-paid card systems for carriers, said Boston lags behind
other cities in this niche market. But he sees signs that carriers
view these cards as ways to draw in first-time users, as well as
teenagers, college students, or temporary residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're extending beyond the credit-challenged,'' he said,
using a phrase frequently heard in the industry to describe people
with nonexistent or bad credit histories that disqualify them for
standard contracts.
</P>
<P>
   If you use a cell phone with any regularity you're far better
off going with a standard contract, assuming you qualify. Permanent
charges on standard plans are as low as a dime or a quarter a
minute.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, the most aggressive pre-paid seller is Omnipoint, and
roughly half its customers are pre-paid users. This company's $50
pre-paid card buys 125 minutes, for instance. It comes to 40 cents
a minute, the lowest pre-paid price in the Boston market. Minutes
expire in 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint PCS revamped its pre-paid offerings this past May,
promoting lower per-minute prices and no expiration dates. But
there's two negative surprises in the package: There's a $125
activation fee and you must pay a 50-cent daily maintenance charge
on top of your usage, which amounts to a $15 monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Duncan, marketing manager for Sprint PCS in New England,
said the company is trying to turn its ``credit-challenged''
customers in another direction, to its ``Account Spending Limit''
program that puts a spending lid on an account. In this way, people
can go with cheaper per-minute standard contracts.
</P>
<P>
   If you must buy your own handset, keep in mind that analog ones
may become defunct in a year or so as the entire cellular world
goes digital. Don't pay a lot for an analog phone if you have to
buy one.
</P>
<P>
   While a Yankee Group study finds that prepaid accounts represent
about 4 percent of wireless subscribers, analysts predict more
people will flock to this option as prices drop and expiration
dates become more distant. That's likely to bring in many who might
now be on the sidelines, turned off by the upfront costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies are starting to focus more on the neophytes and
skeptics,'' said Lowenstein of the Yankee Group.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
E-commerce and sales tax
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the growth of Internet buying, we've gotten more questions
about when buyers have to pay Massachusetts sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   State revenue officials say Internet purchases are viewed the
same as mail-order buys. If the company selling the product has ``a
physical presence in Massachusetts'' _ such as a retail store,
warehouse, phone banks or sales offices _ it must collect sales tax
from the buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this covers only ``taxable items'' as defined by this
state. So if you buy a $50 sweater on-line from the Gap clothing
store, which has a physical presence here, the store can't collect
sales tax because a clothing item under $175 is not taxable.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown, associate general counsel for the state Department
of Revenue, said shipping and handling charges are generally
considered exempt from sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   Now get this: The law goes further to say that if the company
does not have a physical presence here and you buy a taxable item
from them, such as a computer, it is your responsibility to send in
the appropriate sales tax amount to the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   (State revenue officials say this is a ``tough tax to
collect.'')
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Odds &AMP; Ends
</P>
<P>
   --Cell phones and 911: If you have a spare cell phone, keep in
mind that Federal Communications Commission rules require carriers
to put through any 911 emergency call on any handset. That includes
handsets that no longer have an active service contract. That means
if you had an old analog phone with Cellular One, but let the
service contract lapse, you can still use that phone for 911 calls.
Cellular One has to put through the call, at its own expense. So
spare cell phones, which might now be used as a child's toy, might
be better off charged-up and in a car's glove compartment.
</P>
<P>
   --Minimum purchases on credit cards? A reader recently asked if
merchants are allowed to set minimum purchase requirements when
using a Visa card. She recently wanted to charge $5 in gasoline.
She said the clerk insisted on an $8 minimum for credit card
purchases. The clerk also offered to charge $8, then return $3 back
in cash. There's no state or federal law on the subject, but Visa
regulations prohibit merchants from setting minimum purchase
requirements or giving cash back. If such violations are brought to
Visa's attention, their contract can be terminated. Said a Visa
spokeswoman: ``Technically, you can charge a pack of gum.''

MOYNIHAN SEES WHAT OTHERS DON'T 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Among other big things, Daniel Patrick Moynihan's
illustrious career in public service demonstrates the power of
analytical thinking in politics.
</P>
<P>
   The New York senator has contributed so many gems ahead of his
time in nearly four decades on the stage _ from his research on the
condition of ghetto families to his perception of Richard Nixon's
great opportunity as freshly elected president to be the American
Disraeli to his reflections on the blindness of the late-Cold War
CIA to the reality of Soviet weakness _ that one hesitates to pick
one.
</P>
<P>
   But as the chairman-for-life of the Bowtie Caucus rose last week
to lead the opposition to an irresponsible tax cut, it was hard not
to think of a classically Moynihan cut-like-a-diamond paragraph. To
wit:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans' dominant idea, at least for the moment, seems
to be that the social controls of modern government have become
tyrannical or, at the very least, exorbitantly expensive. This
oppression _ so the strategic analysis goes _ is made possible by
taxation, such that cutting taxes becomes an objective in its own
right, business cycles notwithstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   That would command respect, and journalistic envy, as
contemporary commentary under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   But now consider that Moynihan wrote that for The New York Times
nearly 20 years ago, in the early summer of 1980, before Ronald
Reagan had even been elected. It was merely one observation in a
string of them that over time have come to define the terms of
national debate. It is no accident that people who have no
knowledge of Moynihan's astonishing track record see tax cuts well
down on their list of priorities, more as danger than as worthwhile
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, much of the political class was wasting time in
parlor games over whether people like then-Representative Jack Kemp
were correct in their ``new'' theory that government revenues would
be larger with lower tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   But Moynihan saw a deeper purpose, though not in Kemp's advocacy
per se. Moynihan saw Kemp's party moving away from opposition to
particular initiatives of government on their alleged demerits,
battles they had been losing consistently over issues from medical
care for the elderly to providing federal aid to poverty-impacted
school districts; he saw the Republicans embracing a new strategy
of attacking government itself and avoiding the burden of arguing
specifics, by trying to starve it through tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   And he was already warning by 1980 that the Republicans were
likely to prevail in the short term if they succeeded in attacking
government on behalf of working taxpayers as pseudo-populists,
leaving the Democrats as statist, status quo defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan proved Moynihan correct within days of assuming
office, though the senator had to endure much ridicule before
Reagan spoke of disciplining the child of government by cutting its
allowance.
</P>
<P>
   But there was much more to come:
</P>
<P>
   --It was Moynihan who pounced on the gimmickry and dishonesty of
budget director David Stockman (whom he had mentored at Harvard a
decade earlier) to show that hemorrhaging deficits had been
deliberately engineered.
</P>
<P>
   --It was Moynihan who first and most cogently saw through all
the schemes to ``balance'' the budget in formulaic ways that dodged
specific choices _ from amendments to the Constitution, the main
effect of which would be to make recessions far worse, to
``automatic'' spending cuts that politics and good sense would
never allow to take effect.
</P>
<P>
   --And it was Moynihan who more than a decade ago first caused a
stir by noting that operating surpluses in the Social Security
trust funds were being in effect embezzled to mask and fund
deficits in the rest of government. Today, his once-subversive
analysis is the basis of (at last) sound policy that the latest tax
cut scheme would severely undermine.
</P>
<P>
   All this, by the way, was prelude to Moynihan's signal
accomplishment as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee in
President Clinton's first term. It was Moynihan who guided the 1993
budget plan to passage, which in tandem with a first installment he
supported under President Bush in 1980, made a balanced budget
possible and created the crucial fiscal environment for the current
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   His typically reasoned and civil opposition last week came up
one vote short in an absurdly political atmosphere on the Senate
floor, but the Republican victory reeked of Pyrrhus's.
</P>
<P>
   After all we've learned, much of it from Moynihan, it is hard to
imagine we are anywhere near making the same colossal mistake again
after a $4 trillion run-up in the national debt that the senator
also foresaw.

RICKY'S ONLY ONE STAR IN A HUGE LATIN GALAXY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Music writers call him a one-hit wonder. Others assail him as
``too pop.'' And while Americans bop their heads to the beat of
Ricky Martin's snare drum, the predictions of his demise drop like
bombs. But don't believe a word they say.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them don't know Latin music. They base their predictions
on lesser Latino artists who have come and gone. Most of those
critics had never heard of Martin _ an artist who's been recording
for 15 years _ until his smash single, ``Livin' La Vida Loca.'' As
copies of his self-titled English debut were snatched off the
shelves, with more than 5 million copies sold so far, the critics
had to answer to readers who wanted to know: Why haven't you
written about him?
</P>
<P>
   That's when the scurrying began. Writers flipped through press
releases, searched their electronic libraries to find out what had
been written, listened to the CD a few times, and _ with deadlines
looming _ cranked out superficial reviews. Their idea of context
was ``La Macarena.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Christopher Columbus, the critics thought they had
discovered something. But Ricky's not new. After four years
performing with the Puerto Rican boy group Menudo, he put out four
solo albums.
</P>
<P>
   The critics say he's ``not Latin enough,'' but they'd be hard
pressed to define what that means. Latin pop isn't English verses
set to Latin music. It's not watered-down Latin music. It's not a
new genre, made for American consumers. It is its own vast
category, decades old, just like Latin rock, Latin hip-hop, and
Latin jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Without understanding the history of how Latin pop came to be,
the critics are at a loss. They've got a pocketful of stereotypical
words that they can't use: exotic, spicy, sexy, sultry. Mainstream
music writers sprinkle those words into copy, in an attempt to
capture the essence of music that is foreign to them. And when an
artist like Martin comes along, with vibrant music that sounds
familiar, they get suspicious. That's what happens when they ignore
the music of an entire continent.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of Latinos _ Marc Anthony, Los Trio-O, Selena _ have had
huge US success with little marketing. One of the biggest surprises
this year came from a group of elderly Cuban musicians who recorded
long-forgotten danzons and sons on ``Buena Vista Social Club.'' It
sold more than 421,000 units in the United States, according to
SoundScan, and picked up a Grammy along the way _ proof that
Americans are hungry for musica Latina.
</P>
<P>
   The critics _ who should be ahead of the trends, introducing us
to new sounds _ realized they missed the story, so now they want to
dismiss Ricky.
</P>
<P>
   And they're missing another trend that's been unfolding in
recent years: the wave of young Latino artists experimenting with
new sounds. Artists like Shakira, Fulanito, Mana, Ilegales, A. B.
Quintanilla Y Los Kumbia Kings, and Dark Latin Groove.
</P>
<P>
   They avoid writing about Latin music, yet less popular genres,
including American folk, get ink. (While we're on the subject, how
can they continue to ignore hip-hop, considering it is the most
influential genre of our time?)
</P>
<P>
   What makes Ricky Martin's music exciting is his incorporation of
rock and jazz. When an American rock artist mixes different sounds,
it's called fusion. And when artists such as Sting or even Madonna
blend in bits of flamenco guitar or beats from a conga, they call
it ``experimental projects.'' But when Latino musicians borrow
elements of rock, critics call it watered down.
</P>
<P>
   Though Latinos love traditional music _ rancheros, plenas,
cumbias, boleros, merengues _ we've long embraced newer musical
styles. It's time for critics to do the same, considering that the
American public, tired of the yawning rhythms of rock, has.
</P>
<P>
   When Ricky Martin performed at the Grammy awards this year,
singing his international hit, ``La Copa de la Vida,'' he brought
down the house. Until then, most Americans hadn't heard of him,
even though millions of copies of ``The Cup of Life'' had sold
throughout Europe, Latin America, and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, as I drove around Puerto Rico, Ricky's homeland,
his voice seemed to echo everywhere, from bustling San Juan to
quaint rural towns. The island's governor, Pedro Rossello, adopted
it as a theme song while campaigning for statehood before the
plebescite. Campaign vans with monster stereo systems blared
Martin's pulsating music. The hypnotic rhythms made you want to
dance in your sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as that sound rumbles throughout America, I have to wonder:
Will the critics be ready for the next Latin music star? Or will
they dust off those ``Macarena'' reviews?

HOW CAN WE KNOW WHOM WE'RE ELECTING?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Across America, people are reacting negatively to an increasing
phoniness in American politics. The avalanche of big private money
into political campaigns is not only corrupting legislation, it's
drying up originality and genuineness among candidates.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, the gates to congressional service are opened to
those who can raise big money from private contributors for
television commercials and professional campaign consultants, and
closed to those _ regardless of vision, commitment and ability _
who cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Lincoln wouldn't have made it in today's environment.
Nor would Harry Truman.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, 95 percent of the contested congressional races
went to the candidate who raised and spent the most money. It was
history's first billion-dollar election.
</P>
<P>
   Among the world's leading democracies, ours is distinguished by
two dismal statistics. We spend the most, per capita, on our
campaigns _ ads, commercials and ballyhoo. And we have the lowest
turnout of voters among those legally qualified to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Yet we claim to be the foremost example of self-government.
Shame!
</P>
<P>
   The repeated refusal of Congress to address campaign finances
drives an ever-bigger wedge between lawmakers and the public.
Dominance by money shrinks the electorate's faith in our system,
promoting a crass commercial hucksterism that disconnects
candidates from the average citizen. It puts its premium on
phoniness, its hope in gullibility.
</P>
<P>
   The public isn't really deceived. It's just increasingly turned
off. William Safire, New York Times columnist and former
presidential speech writer, recently offered a perceptive column
pleading with politicians to stop playing roles and be themselves!
</P>
<P>
   Safire's target was the growing habit among office seekers to
hire professional consultants to adjust their public personas, much
as aging actors engage plastic surgeons to make them look younger
than they are.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate objects of this advice were Hillary Clinton, New
York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin. Paid political gurus, Safire reports, are trying to make
over each with a new and different personality. But his broader
message is to politicos in general: Be yourself.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Fort Worth Star Telegram columnist Bill Thompson
offered the same advice _ be yourself _ to Vice President Al Gore
and presidential hopeful Bill Bradley. Both, Thompson wrote, have
``enlisted the aid of consultants and coaches'' to help them
``become more magnetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Thompson adds (and I agree) that the longer one talks with
either man, the more clear it becomes that he is thoughtful,
creative and possessed of intellectual depth and principle.
</P>
<P>
   But how _ in the current system of political practice, can the

can we ever come to feel that we know a candidate?

<P>
   Most advanced democracies give candidates free and equal

<P>
   Traveling over the country in recent years, speaking often to
college audiences, I sometimes encounter a young person seeking
advice on how to get started in elective politics. I give what
suggestions I can.
</P>
<P>
   Usually I'll ask, ``Why do you want to be in Congress?'' With
discouraging frequency, I'm getting answers that have less and less
to do with public needs or legislative solutions, what an
officeholder can do for the country. Instead, I'm hearing what
being in office might do for the individual's career goals.
</P>
<P>
   For a young law student to covet the experience and public
exposure he'd get by serving as an assistant district attorney
doesn't bother me if I think the youth qualified. But I am
disturbed when a bright, ambitious young person aspires to go to
Congress, or the Legislature, without the faintest notion of what
issues he or she would support.
</P>
<P>
   Some years back, a brilliant young man set out to be elected to
the Texas Legislature as a calculated steppingstone to higher
office. Steeped in the techniques of sampling opinion, he based his
appeal solely upon issues he had market-tested through opinion
polls.
</P>
<P>
   He cut three separate 50-second videotapes advocating these
issues and sought to test these tapes before small focus groups of
friends to decide which of the three to use on television. ``I want
you to listen carefully to these,'' he asked, ``and tell me in
which of the three you think I seem the most sincere.''
</P>
<P>
   He was surprised when I said, ``The way to seem sincere is to be
sincere.''
</P>
<P>
   Really, that's about all Harry Truman had going for him. But it
was enough.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we need to re-examine that word. ``Sincere.'' It stems
from two Latin words, meaning literally ``without wax.'' Roman
merchants had begun importing artifacts and ceramics goods from the
Greek islands. Some were cracked or damaged in transit, and the
cracks were cleverly concealed by waxy veneers.
</P>
<P>
   To identify a genuine article that hadn't been cosmetically
repaired, reputable marketers would use the words ``sin cerussa. It
was a guarantee of value, of authenticity. Sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   There's a parallel in politics, or ought to be. That's what Bill
Safire and Bill Thompson are saying, I think. The danger of modern
political practice is its nauseating emphasis upon image at the
expense of substance.
</P>
<P>
   The public deserves something better from us who seek to serve.
The least that people deserve is ourselves, our real selves _ our
unadorned, unembellished, honest-to-God selves.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Across America, people are reacting negatively to an increasing
phoniness in American politics. The avalanche of big private money
into political campaigns is not only corrupting legislation, it's
drying up originality and genuineness among candidates.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, the gates to congressional service are opened to
those who can raise big money from private contributors for
television commercials and professional campaign consultants, and
closed to those _ regardless of vision, commitment and ability _
who cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Lincoln wouldn't have made it in today's environment.
Nor would Harry Truman.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, 95 percent of the contested congressional races
went to the candidate who raised and spent the most money. It was
history's first billion-dollar election.
</P>
<P>
   Among the world's leading democracies, ours is distinguished by
two dismal statistics. We spend the most, per capita, on our
campaigns _ ads, commercials and ballyhoo. And we have the lowest
turnout of voters among those legally qualified to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Yet we claim to be the foremost example of self-government.
Shame!
</P>
<P>
   The repeated refusal of Congress to address campaign finances
drives an ever-bigger wedge between lawmakers and the public.
Dominance by money shrinks the electorate's faith in our system,
promoting a crass commercial hucksterism that disconnects
candidates from the average citizen. It puts its premium on
phoniness, its hope in gullibility.
</P>
<P>
   The public isn't really deceived. It's just increasingly turned
off. William Safire, New York Times columnist and former
presidential speech writer, recently offered a perceptive column
pleading with politicians to stop playing roles and be themselves!
</P>
<P>
   Safire's target was the growing habit among office seekers to
hire professional consultants to adjust their public personas, much
as aging actors engage plastic surgeons to make them look younger
than they are.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate objects of this advice were Hillary Clinton, New
York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin. Paid political gurus, Safire reports, are trying to make
over each with a new and different personality. But his broader
message is to politicos in general: Be yourself.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Fort Worth Star Telegram columnist Bill Thompson
offered the same advice _ be yourself _ to Vice President Al Gore
and presidential hopeful Bill Bradley. Both, Thompson wrote, have
``enlisted the aid of consultants and coaches'' to help them
``become more magnetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Thompson adds (and I agree) that the longer one talks with
either man, the more clear it becomes that he is thoughtful,
creative and possessed of intellectual depth and principle.
</P>
<P>
   But how _ in the current system of political practice, can the
average citizen expect to know? Given the slick slogans and
repetitive, market-tested simplifications carefully crafted to help
candidates ``stick to message'' and dodge controversial questions _

 &HT;    AWARD TO CARTERS IS NATION'S HIGHEST CIVILIAN HONOR
 &HT;    By RAVEN HILL
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Presidential Medal of Freedom, presented Monday
by President Clinton to former President Jimmy Carter and his wife,
Rosalynn, is the nation's highest civilian honor.
</P>
<P>
   Established by President Truman in 1945 to recognize outstanding
wartime service, the medal was reintroduced as an annual honor for
distinguished civilian service during peacetime by President
Kennedy in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy changed the award's name from ``Medal of Freedom'' to
``Presidential Medal of Freedom'' and announced it would honor
those who have made ``especially meritorious'' contributions to
national security, world peace, or cultural, public or private
endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   The medal, redesigned with the advice of Kennedy and his wife,
Jacqueline, is a white star with gold eagles and 13 silver stars on
a blue field.
</P>
<P>
   In a White House ceremony Thursday, Clinton will present the
medal to eight additional honorees: former Treasury Secretary Lloyd
M. Bentsen, World Jewish Congress President Edgar M. Bronfman Sr.,
labor activist Evy Dubrow, social worker Sister M. Isolina Ferr,
former President Gerald R. Ford, civil rights attorney Oliver White
Hill, diplomat and negotiator Max Kampelman, and environmentalist
Edgar Wayburn.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has awarded more than 70 of the medals since he took
office in 1993. Previous recipients include former Supreme Court
justice Thurgood Marshall, civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks, gun
control advocate Jim Brady and former German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl. Nine sports figures have received the award, including Jesse
Owens, Joe DiMaggio and Arthur Ashe.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential medal is distinct from the Congressional Gold
Medal, the highest award that Congress can bestow.

CHURCH REACHES OUT TO CHILDREN ON THE FRINGE OF HOMELESSNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAIME JORDAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ It took the tears of a 6-year-old to open
Vesta Wilson's heart to the importance of her mission.
</P>
<P>
   It was three years ago when she gave Larry, now 9, a bag of
miniature race cars for his birthday. She hugged him and said,
``Larry, I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   He began to cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody ever told me they loved me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry is typical of the nearly 40 children Wilson sees each week
at Sunday School at Church on the Slab, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Gray, of Daily Bread Ministries, founded Church on the Slab
in 1989 to feed the homeless while providing a spiritual outlet.
The ``slab'' is a concrete foundation just off Interstate 35W in a
poor area of Fort Worth. Every Sunday morning, the drifters gather
under a huge tent to eat a hot meal and to sway to keyboard music,
clap their hands and fall to the floor in the throes of spiritual
passion.
</P>
<P>
   And every Sunday morning, the children gather at a donated
building next to the slab for their spiritual nourishment.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the children live with their grandparents, Wilson said.
Their mothers are dead, in jail or living on the streets. Few
children know their fathers, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really difficult for children in those situations to ever
be able to do anything but be back on the streets,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   So she comes back week after week, determined to alter their
fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's the children and being able to make a difference
in those children so they don't end up like these men who are out
there, give them some kind of hope that Jesus can make a difference
in their lives,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the school, the children gather around two tables. On a
recent Sunday, the children read about creation and played a game
to reinforce the lesson.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of the group, 6-year-old Lulu, sat curled on a
teacher's lap, her finger in her mouth, her shoes off, exposing
dusty feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the baby of the kids,'' said Sunday-school teacher
Brenda Rutledge of Euless, a Fort Worth suburb. ``They always pick
on her, and I won't let them pick on her.''
</P>
<P>
   Children who attend the Sunday school get more than lessons.
Past outings have included camping trips and Texas Rangers baseball
games.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best gift, however, is the hugs.
</P>
<P>
   As the morning progressed, the teachers ended virtually every
statement with some gesture of love, a hug or words.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's husband, Jim, said he can't believe the change in some
of the children.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it's hard to break a cycle of violence and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two or three are getting a bit older, and I think they're
gang-banging; in fact I know they are,'' Jim Wilson said. Still,
many occasionally stop by to say, ``Hi, Miss Vesta,'' and get a
hug.
</P>
<P>
   It's often hard to tell from the faces of the children the
circumstances to which they return after every service. Tommy,
known to the group as Spud, laughed so hard at his own jokes that
he nearly fell out of his chair on several occasions. And when it
came time to pass the mission plate, the children contributed
almost $3.
</P>
<P>
   But other times, there are obvious signs of what they've
overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Like 7-year-old Shane, who was cut from his dying mother's womb.
Shane's mother, clad in a brother's hat and coat, was mistaken for
someone's enemy as she was crossing a street to a store and was
struck repeatedly by a car. Shane survived but weighed only 1 pound
at birth. Today, his tiny frame, about the size of a typical
4-year-old, carries the burden of his prematurity. But his grin
spreads wide across his face, balancing his eyes, which continually
creep inward.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the midst of the despair, the teachers continue to come
back. Many times, they're the only constant in the lives of the
children, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``People go off to be missionaries,'' Rutledge said. ``This is
our mission field. The kids need us here. You're on the front lines
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said there is one factor separating the children from the
pocket of poverty that surrounds them. It's God's love, she said.
</P>
<P>
   That's what she tries to show Shane and Lulu and the others who
come regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look like they have a choice, but they do,'' she
said.
</P>

GPS TRACKING SYSTEM FINDS MISSING KIDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALYSON WARD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How far would you go to protect your child? Bill Brown and Dan
Booker, two South Carolina businessmen and grandparents, are
betting you'd go pretty far. Far enough, maybe, to track your child
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Booker's company, Grandparents Inc., has developed a
tracking system that uses global positioning satellite (GPS)
technology to find missing children anywhere in the United States.
The device weighs less than 2 pounds, is about the size of a
cellular phone and can be carried in a backpack or even hidden in
clothing. If a child carrying the device is kidnapped or
disappears, parents can contact local police, who in turn call the
South Carolina tracking center. The child can then be located in
about 30 seconds, the developers say.
</P>
<P>
   The Protect Me Toys device uses the same technology as the
LoJack tracking system installed in some vehicles. Police can
locate stolen cars using a satellite: Call the automobile, and you
know where it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where our system is different,'' Brown said, ``is you don't
have to use a 40-pound battery.''
</P>
<P>
   When the call is made to the device, a map pops up on the
tracker's computer screen. A panda bear icon shows where the device
and the child are, including the street they are on and the exact
speed and direction they are moving.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Booker aren't selling the devices at retail locations.
Instead, they're hoping corporate sponsors will buy the devices and
distribute them to kids for free. The partners want to make sure
it's not ``just a rich man's toy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think somebody's income should determine whether or
not they can protect their child,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   But the high cost of high tech (the price may eventually be
shaved down from about $500 to $200 each, with a monthly service
fee) means this sort of mass distribution may be slow going. To
distribute the gadgets they have now, the men go through district
attorneys and law enforcement officials _ people who know about the
kids in their area who are at the highest risk for kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Booker and Brown say they hope the portable units can be made
smaller as technology progresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working on a new system right now that we hope to get
small enough to put in the top of a pair of tennis shoes,'' Brown
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Brown points out that the system he and Booker
developed works through the FBI and police departments _ ``We don't
track these things for the parents'' _ the tracking device has
potential for widespread use beyond kidnapping cases. Some experts,
concerned with privacy issues, say this could be a problem if
access to such a system moved beyond authorities to ordinary
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly seems that for its intended use, this is
certainly a good thing,'' said Frank Colosi, a Fort Worth attorney
and American Civil Liberties Union representative. ``But the
problem with any technology is it can be used on any of us when we
don't even know about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody deserves some privacy, and the older you get, the
more privacy you're entitled to,'' he said. ``There's a question
(with children who are) 15 or 16 if this is an intrusion on their
privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Colosi also points out that the widespread use of personal
tracking systems could trigger a trust-no-one mentality that could
lead toward a ``fortressed society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People will start thinking there is no safety anywhere for
anybody,'' he said. ``We end up living in a society that I'm not
sure anybody really wants to live in.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, though, this sort of debate is academic, and the
Protect Me Toys tracker is only intended to protect at-risk
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing anybody can do that's 100 percent,'' Brown
said. ``This at least gives you an opportunity _ a big opportunity
_ to save a child's life.''

CRASH? HA! I'M MORE WORRIED ABOUT THAT AIRLINE FOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am not exactly a frequent flier. I've flown, at most, maybe
300 times in the past 15 years. That's just enough that I tune out
when they start giving the pre-flight instructions, although not
enough that I'd have any idea what to do if the plane actually
started going down.
</P>
<P>
   That's because I don't believe my plane will ever crash. And
that's because I am part of the silent majority; I am a fearless
flier.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics do sound ominous. It's estimated that one in four
Americans is at least somewhat afraid of flying. An estimated one
in 10 won't get on a plane. But look at it the other way; that
means far more than half of the public thinks flying is not much
different than catching a bus.
</P>
<P>
   Like me. I think it's far more dangerous to eat the in-flight
meal than to go somewhere on a plane. It's not that I am an
unusually brave soul; I'm scared of plenty of things, including
spiders, the dark, undercooked pork, Wal-Mart, and, inexplicably,
heights.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there have been only two times on aircraft when I've been
even a little bit afraid: once on a small commuter jet going to
Aspen that seemed certain to slam into one of the Rocky Mountains;
and once on a puddle-jumper prop plane going from one island in the
Caymans to another (we kept circling and circling, waiting for
somebody to shoo some cows off the grass runway).
</P>
<P>
   Both situations were over in a few minutes, before an air-sick
bag was called for. The flight attendant on the Aspen flight
quickly assisted the one passenger who took ill from the
topsy-turvy turns. And the cows-on-the-landing-strip story made for
a good laugh down the road. Neither would prevent me, or most
people, probably, from getting into the air again.
</P>
<P>
   See, when you look at the alternatives, planes look pretty good.
Air travel is cheap (relatively speaking), fast and, if it's not
exactly comfortable, it's usually bearable, even in coach. Until
the United States gets its act together on rail service, there's no
better way to get from one side of the country to the other.
</P>
<P>
   Safety just isn't a big concern for many of us, which makes
sense if you look at it from a practical standpoint. The airlines
make money (and, at last count, a lot of it) by getting people from
one place to another safely, so it's in their best interest to keep
those things in the air. Forget that truism about there being no
such thing as bad publicity _ a jet going down and killing 110
people or so is very bad publicity indeed. Just ask ValuJet.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the women and men who fly commercial jets have had
years of experience and training. (Which is not something you can
say about a lot of the people with whom you're sharing the
interstate.) And, because they're up there with you, they have a
vested interest in getting back on the ground safely.
</P>
<P>
   But practical matters aren't the only aspect. For those of us
who love to travel, who live for exploring new cities and stumbling
across unfamiliar territory, air travel is at worst a necessary
evil, at best a fun part of the journey.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for jets, few of us would ever have the chance to
see Europe or Africa or Asia, to see the Louvre or the Great
Pyramids or the Great Wall. In fact, many of us would rarely get
home for Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   And to experience those things, I'm willing to assume a little
bit of risk.

JIM MORA'S YOUTHFUL LOOK BELIES HIS THICK SKIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFFRI CHADIHA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKTON, Calif. _ Don't tell Jim Mora about pressure. The man
has known nothing else since he walked into the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to Mora about pressure and you'll hear stories about his
coaching in New Orleans earlier this decade, working as a secondary
coach under his father Jim, the team's head coach from 1986-95.
Back then, the young Jim wasn't a popular man at times.
</P>
<P>
   He was daddy's boy. An easy target for fans upset with a
struggling team, one who heard comments that could make even Howard
Stern cringe. But Mora was something else as well. He was learning
lessons that would only help him cope with the title and
responsibility he now holds, as defensive coordinator of the San
Francisco 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Mora heard his share of criticism last season when the 49ers'
secondary, the unit he coached, struggled. Now he could be in for
even worse if his defense can't improve on last year's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I learned from New Orleans is that you can't let
that kind of stuff bother you,'' said Mora, who coached in New
Orleans from 1992-96. ``I heard cheers like, `Keep the coach and
fire the son.' You have to understand that people like to express
their opinions but if you're doing the best you can do, you can't
worry about it. The thing I've always been able to do is not let
this job define who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   One glimpse at Jim Mora and the first thing you wonder is if he
swiped the secret formula that keeps Dick Clark from aging.
</P>
<P>
   His birth date tells you he turns 38 in November. His impish
face and abundance of skittish energy suggest otherwise. This is a
coach who likely will be carded in bars well into his 50s.
</P>
<P>
   That youthful appearance also makes you wonder something else:
Is one of the league's youngest coordinators ready to take over a
defense that was the weak link of last year's team? His background
indicates that he is.
</P>
<P>
   Mora broke into coaching as a 23-year-old secondary coach with
the San Diego Chargers in 1985. He has tutored under established
coaches like Gunther Cunningham and Vic Fangio, not to mention the
insight he gained from his father. Steve Mariucci, the head coach
of the 49ers, didn't have to know much else before choosing Mora as
the successor to John Marshall, who left to join George Seifert's
staff in Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``A personal philosophy of mine is to promote from within,''
Mariucci said. ``I wanted someone who could blend in quickly, and I
didn't want to change our scheme. We had a good young coach who was
ready to do the job. He was anxious and he also had opportunities
elsewhere. So we figured he was ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Darnell Walker said Mora ``has a lot of knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget about how old he is. He's been in football so long and
he's been through the ups and downs. A lot of coaches have
different philosophies, but what a defense ultimately does is take
on the coordinator's personality. He's so hyped and energetic that
you know it will be fun playing for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The task that lies ahead of Mora isn't an easy one. The 49ers'
defense fell apart last season. The secondary was either
ineffective or injured, the linebackers inconsistent and the
defensive line so thin by season's end that the team called Charles
Haley out of retirement. The end result was a unit that surrendered
333.9 yards per game and ranked 23rd in the league in total
defense.
</P>
<P>
   There are still questions. Cornerback remains an area of
uncertainty and the defensive line won't be solid until defensive
tackle Bryant Young returns from the broken right leg he suffered
last season. Those factors mean that Mora starts the year under the
microscope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to make excuses for last year, but we dealt with
a lot of factors,'' Mora said. ``We lost some key personalities
from the year before, guys like Dana Stubblefield and Kevin Greene.
We had injuries at cornerback and we were breaking in a new
linebacker in Winfred Tubbs. We got off to a slow start. But we
expect things to be better because we have a more consistent
unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Mora's philosophy has been to simplify the defensive package. He
wants his players attacking, flying around the field, creating
chaos and avoiding as many mental mistakes as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In this age of free agency, with personnel changing so much,
Mora doesn't consider it wise to keep players thinking about too
many things. So far, the response has been positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing a great job,'' said linebacker Ken Norton Jr. ``We
see that he wants to be aggressive and come after people. He
doesn't want to sit back.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'll also be interested to see how things play out. Right
now, everything looks good in practice. We'll see how he handles
things when it's third-and-2 and he has to make a tough call. We
all know he can do it, but that test is still out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mora understands what he'll have to do to prove himself. But
when you have his age and his family name, you start gearing up for
such moments long before they arrive. Even as the new coordinator,
he has seen enough to not let this job beat him down.

HENDRIX MADE IT AN ANTHEM OF ANGUISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early on the morning of Aug. 18, 1969, Jimi Hendrix was Artie
Kornfeld's alarm clock.
</P>
<P>
   Kornfeld was one of Woodstock's four producers, and the night
before, he'd been given Thorazine to help him sleep and to get over
being dosed by psilocybin, a powerful hallucinogen. Lying in a
backstage trailer, he was startled into consciousness by Hendrix's
guitar picking out the melody to ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' and
then exploding into howls of pure noise, feedback, almost-human
shrieks of agony.
</P>
<P>
   He ran to the stage and stood transfixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he added the bombs and everything, it represented all
those years we had bomb tests and we had to hide under our desks at
school, and the constant fear of being drafted, and every week
hearing another kid I went to school with had been killed in
Vietnam,'' Kornfeld says. ``It was the whole story of the
frustration of a generation, but it left you with hope that the
flag was still waving.''
</P>
<P>
   The song symbolizes the entire event and the mind-set of young
people during that tumultuous summer of moonwalks and Charles
Manson, and it stands as a milestone of Hendrix's career, certainly
one of his most famous concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Mick Jagger has called it the most politically important rock
statement of the '60s, and former Living Colour guitarist Vernon
Reid compared it with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ``I Have a
Dream'' speech. Last month, ``Live at Woodstock,'' a two-CD set
featuring nearly the entire two-hours-plus performance (including
several previously unreleased songs) was released by MCA Records. A
remastered version of the 1970 film ``Jimi Hendrix: Live at
Woodstock'' was released the same day, along with an expanded DVD
version of the recent ``Band of Gypsies'' documentary.
</P>
<P>
   It's a measure of just how far removed young rockers are from
their famous forefathers that Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst
recently opined in ``USA Today'' that Hendrix's ``Banner'' doesn't
sound ``that good. It was just a classic moment, a memory. I wasn't
there. I don't get it. I'll never get it.''
</P>
<P>
   But millions have. Hendrix's version of the national anthem has
attained near-mythic proportions in the 30 years since it was
recorded. If people think of one song from Woodstock, they probably
think of ``Banner,'' the way Hendrix turned it into a turbulent,
unholy war cry of anguish, exploding bombs and screams, how he made
the song sound like Vietnam, the riots in the wake of King's death,
the constant clashes between anti-war protesters and the police.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, though, that Hendrix's ``Banner'' _ and his entire
Woodstock set _ was a contradiction: While it was his most overt
political statement and one of his most well-remembered shows, it
was not even close to being his best performance.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was it even seen by most of the people who attended the
show. Due to long delays, torrential rain and disorganization,
Hendrix didn't hit the stage until after the three-day festival was
technically over.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one-tenth of the crowd of 400,000 that had filled Max
Yasgur's dairy farm Friday, Saturday and Sunday was left: Hendrix
faced a motley crew of sleepy, hungry stragglers and a huge, muddy
field strewn with tons of trash.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Hendrix's career was in turmoil: He'd broken up the
three-man Jimi Hendrix Experience two months earlier after a
performance at a pop festival in Denver. He'd then spent weeks in
upstate New York, jamming with friends and trying to fashion a new
sound and a new band _ dubbed Gypsy Sun and Rainbows _ that mixed
the hard, blues-based psychedelic rock of the past with Latin
percussion and funk.
</P>
<P>
   It was an underrehearsed band that hit the stage that Monday
morning, and the largest one Hendrix had ever fronted. In addition
to old hand Mitch Mitchell on drums, Hendrix also had enlisted
bassist Billy Cox, percussionists Juma Sultan and Jerry Velez and,
for the first time, a rhythm guitarist (Larry Lee). And the band's
sloppiness and lack of cohesion is often plainly evident.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Hendrix was torn as to just how political he would
be. According to Brad Tolinski, editor in chief of ``Guitar
World,'' the Black Panthers had been pressuring Hendrix to become
more vocally political and to endorse their organization.
</P>
<P>
   But Hendrix had resisted; he was obviously in favor of peace and
love and good feelings, but he had made very few political
statements in the past. By playing ``Banner,'' Tolinski says,
Hendrix was ``commenting on society the best way he knew. You
didn't need to have him say anything about it. It's all there. It
was the way he could say what he wanted to say the most
comfortably.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix produced the dazzling variety of sounds through a
Uni-Vibe, a Fuzz Face distortion pedal, a wah-wah pedal and
feedback from his amplifiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why his whole thing can't be duplicated,'' says
Tolinski. ``It was all about the interaction of the guitar and the
electronics and the spontaneous reaction to the sound the amps were
making. It's like a Jackson Pollock action painting _ reacting to
the way the paint was hitting the canvas.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than a half-hour after he played ``Banner,'' Hendrix
concluded his 16-song set with his 1967 hit ``Hey Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   He would jettison most of the band after just two more shows and
go back out again as a trio with Cox and drummer Buddy Miles. His
New Year's Eve show at New York's Fillmore East would be recorded
and released as ``Band of Gypsies.'' On July 4, 1970, he played the
second Atlanta Pop Festival with Jethro Tull, Rare Earth and
others.
</P>
<P>
   And little less than two months later, after a troubled European
tour and a final show on an island in Germany, Hendrix would
overdose on barbiturates and choke to death in London.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing years, his legend would continue to grow as
literally dozens of releases (many of them studio jams never meant
for the public) would flood the stores.
</P>
<P>
   As rock fans young and old looked back to the late '60s for
inspiration, his abilities would attain a near-mythic status, his
songs seen as the benchmark for guitar playing. And ``Banner'' is
forever part and parcel of that legacy, the moment when he spoke
for his generation through his six strings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimi was so far ahead of the curve,'' says Tolinski. ``Jeff
Beck told me, `Forget it. When Jimi came along he made the rest of
'em sound like schoolteachers.' And nobody else has ever really
come close.''

 &HT;    CCE on the comeback trail
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Murphy's Law _ anything that can go wrong will go
wrong _ paints too rosy a picture of life.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Henry Schimberg believes in the wake of the European
health scare that engulfed his Atlanta-based bottling company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we were working under Schimberg's Law,'' said
the 66-year-old president and chief executive of Coca-Cola
Enterprises. ``Schimberg's Law is very simple: Murphy was an
optimist.''
</P>
<P>
   Schimberg, who has been in the soft drink business for more than
40 years, said the June recall of all Coca-Cola products in Belgium
ranked as the worst professional experience of his life. Two
CCE-owned plants _ one in Belgium and the other in France _
produced the beverages that caused illnesses to nearly 250
Belgians.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one is good and 10 is as bad as it gets, this is a 9.85,''
Schimberg said last week in his first in-depth interview about the
crisis. ``I don't know how you can get much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   He then invoked a 19th-century quotation from Friedrich
Nietzsche: ``What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire Coca-Cola system is counting on that principle as it
attempts to recover from the largest and most damaging recall in
its 113-year history.
</P>
<P>
   CCE withdrew some 17 million beverage cases from the Belgian
market at a cost of $103 million. That figure doesn't include the
tens of millions of dollars in lost sales still piling up for CCE
and Coca-Cola Co., which owns 40 percent of the world's largest
soft drink bottler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have one overriding issue, and that is to regain
the confidence of the customers in every country affected by the
recall,'' Schimberg said. In addition to Belgium and France,
several other European nations imposed full or partial bans on Coke
products for about two weeks in June.
</P>
<P>
   To recover from this debacle, CCE and Coca-Cola Co. have teamed
up on a multipronged marketing and advertising strategy that
appears to be working. The goal is to contain the reverberating
effects on Coke's image and sales to the second and third quarters,
preventing any spillover beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving in the right direction at a fast speed,'' said
Philippe Lenfant, CCE's general manager in Belgium. He has been on
the front line of the crisis since June 8, when the first
teen-agers reported getting sick.
</P>
<P>
   Lenfant added, however, that there has not been a full recovery
yet.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a July survey of European consumers by the Goldman
Sachs investment firm found a ``meaningful'' 14 percent with a
deteriorating overall perception of Coca-Cola products. In
addition, 81 percent of Coca-Cola consumers indicated they will
definitely continue to buy company products in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In both Belgium and France, CCE and Coca-Cola Co. are tracking
consumer sentiment on a daily basis. While officials would not
reveal the specific results, they said there was significant
improvement in July.
</P>
<P>
   But accurate sales figures are still hard to come by, especially
in Belgium, because executives don't really know how to separate
three different types of purchases:
</P>
<P>
   _ Sales related to the restocking of retail shelves and consumer
refrigerators after the recall;
</P>
<P>
   _ Sales driven by the super-promotional efforts now under way;
</P>
<P>
   _ Sales that would have been registered regardless of the other
two variables.
</P>
<P>
   Still, June's pessimism has been washed away by recent events.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more fun today than six weeks ago,'' Lenfant said
during a lengthy interview with several CCE officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect the recovery to be very quick,'' added Dominique
Reiniche, CCE's general manager in France.
</P>
<P>
   Executives attribute the partial turnaround to the considerable
brand strength Coca-Cola had before the health scare, as well as to
the intensity with which it has been trying to repair the
situation. An enormous amount of time, energy and money is being
spent trying to preserve Coke's leading market share _ 64 percent
in Belgium and 55 percent in France, according to Beverage Digest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proof will be how they manage to reassure people,'' said
Goldman Sachs analyst Marc Cohen. ``It must be executed well. I
think they're doing OK so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, when the product bans were lifted in late June, the
companies concentrated their advertising and marketing efforts on
apologizing to consumers, thanking them for their previous loyalty
and telling them that Coca-Cola will work hard to regain it.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola and CCE also tried to explain the limited nature of
the quality and health problems. They pointed out that the causes
of the nausea and vomiting _ defective carbon dioxide and a
fungicide that got on the outside of some cans _ did not pose a
health threat.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the apology and education phases behind them, the
companies are aggressively marketing their brands in more
traditional ways, emphasizing the standard summertime themes of
pleasure and refreshment under the general umbrella, ``Your
Coca-Cola is back.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, the system is involved in many more
promotions than it would have been had the health scare not
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in Belgium, Coke and CCE have organized
product-sampling events outside thousands of stores every weekend
over the past several weeks. The last such events end today,
indicating that the companies feel the need to reassure consumers
is waning.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the companies are trucking in sand to stage beach parties,
and they're sponsoring about 100 other events at which Coke is
given away.
</P>
<P>
   Going forward, the companies are planning to mount special
programs to bolster their image at schools, where many of the
sicknesses occurred, as well as in small shops and pubs that often
get overlooked in favor of the larger supermarkets. But the system
is no longer in a position to take anything for granted as it tries
to regain some retail shelf space lost to competitors during the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   These efforts come after trying to get a free bottle of Coke
into every Belgian household. What's more, 2,500 employee
``ambassadors'' were each dispatched with a free case of Coke to
share with friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   In France, meanwhile, 5 million leaflets were distributed in
stores to complement a substantial media advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The other key part of the comeback, especially for CCE, which
bottles and distributes the beverages, is on the production side.
</P>
<P>
   The company's manufacturing system is now meeting about 90
percent of existing demand because it had to go into overdrive to
restock the pipeline with beverages following the recall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've asked our employees to work like hell,'' Lenfant said.
``We were forced to take back 17 million cases in a couple of
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Since getting the green light to resume production, CCE's plants
have been operating around the clock, seven days a week. In normal
times, they only would be operating one or two shifts a day, five
days a week.
</P>
<P>
   It will take until the third week of August to get all of Coke's
beverages in all of their different sizes and containers back on
the shelves in the appropriate numbers, Lenfant said.
</P>
<P>
   While employees have been working extremely hard, CCE executives
said, they haven't grown weary yet because of the positive momentum
that appears to be building.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get Coca-Cola in the blood,'' said Norman Findley,
president of CCE's European operations. ``Those first weeks were
very difficult, the most difficult in my 23 years in the Coke
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, with a turnaround under way, Findley subscribes
less to Murphy's and Schimberg's laws and more to a paraphrase of
Charles Dickens: ``This was the worst of times and the best of
times.''

 &HT;    Schimberg: Price increases fixed 'deteriorating situation'
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   During a recent interview, Coca-Cola Enterprises President and
Chief Executive Henry Schimberg fielded questions on a variety of
financial and management topics:
</P>
<P>
   Financial issues
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where do you think your stock price, which has been
depressed, is headed over the next year? (It closed Friday at
$27.31 1/4, down 23 percent for the year.)
</P>
<P>
   A: The analysts are predicting anything from a low over the next
12 months of $36 to a high of $50, with a median in the low- to
mid-$40s. I see no reason that we shouldn't achieve those levels,
based on our performance.
</P>
<P>
   Q:The median, the high or the low?
</P>
<P>
   A: At a minimum, the median.
</P>
<P>
   QWhat can you say about second-half earnings?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm comfortable with the analysts' projections about our
earnings over the balance of this year. (Analysts estimate the
company will earn about 15 cents a share in the last half of the
year, compared with 12 cents for the same period last year,
according to First Call.)
</P>
<P>
   Q: CCE has raised U.S. supermarket prices for its beverages
considerably _ about 5.5 percent in the second quarter, compared
with a year ago. But the move has cut into case sales. Why did you
do it?
</P>
<P>
   A: We had a situation in the United States where we were selling
product at wholesale and retail at lower levels than they were
selling a decade ago, which doesn't make much economic sense. We
were inhibiting bottler profitability and significantly diminishing
retailer profitability. As leaders in the marketplace, we had, from
my standpoint, no choice but to take action to correct a
deteriorating situation. ... We had to make the move to build
shareholder value over the long term, and we understood it would
impact sales and market share in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will you increase supermarket prices further in the near
future?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think what we're looking for now is to solidify what we've
accomplished in terms of pricing, as opposed to moving pricing even
more.
</P>
<P>
   Q: CCE made $3.7 billion in acquisitions in 1997 and $1.2
billion last year. But so far this year you have been less active
on the acquisition front. Are you taking a breather?
</P>
<P>
   A: Certainly the level of acquisitions made last year requires
some digestion on our part. Basically, our acquisition strategy at
this point is really opportunistically generated. As people come to
us with a desire to sell, and we can at nondilutive levels, we will
do so.
</P>
<P>
   Management issues
</P>
<P>
   Q: You implemented a decentralized management structure after
coming to CCE in 1991, which many analysts credit with turning
around the company. Please explain it.
</P>
<P>
   A: Local markets ought to be determinants of our action ...
within the context of a series of policies and goals that are
centrally prescribed. So a decentralized operating environment is
not an anarchistic one. In fact, in order to really be successful,
it requires a greater level of discipline than a centralized one.
... Not only is the execution local, but local people have to be
held accountable for that execution. You cannot have that level of
accountability if you try to over-centralize the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did the decentralization help you during the European
health crisis?
</P>
<P>
   A: Local people were at the heart of the negotiations with
regulators over there. It validates the whole concept of local
marketing strategies. The people who worked at CCE interfacing with
these regulatory agencies are nationals. They understand the
customs and mores of the countries where they operate. I think that
helped us significantly in conducting a more effective dialogue
with the agencies and ministers than would have been the case had
we not had this grass-roots infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will you retire in April as planned?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Who will succeed you?
</P>
<P>
   A: There is a committee of the board that is focused on
succession. Fortunately, for us, we have a lot of very competent
and viable internal candidates. (CCE recently named two principal
operating officers, Norman Findley and John Alm, who are considered
front-runners to succeed Schimberg by some analysts.)
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the company looking at outside candidates as well?
</P>
<P>
   A: CCE is not looking outside the company.
</P>

 &HT;    EVEN PARTIAL ECLIPSE PUTS MIDEAST ON EDGE
 &HT;    Moving in (i) International and (l) Lifestyle categories.

<P>
   BETHLEHEM, West Bank _ Even on a normal day, people in the
Middle East are tense and sensitive to symbolism, so it's no wonder
an eclipse sets them on edge.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Bible tells us there was a solar eclipse the day
Jesus Christ died in Jerusalem: ``Darkness came over the whole
earth,'' states Luke 23:44.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Middle East, which will be brushed by the path of the
eclipse Wednesday, people have been blitzed by cautionary
advertising campaigns and officials are nervously making
preparations.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan, Syria and the areas under the Palestinian Authority,
Wednesday has been declared a national holiday in order to avoid
exposing workers to the temptation of looking skyward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have four children. I have to take care,'' said David
Mansour, who plans to close his souvenir shop on Bethlehem's Manger
Square to spend Wednesday inside with his family.
</P>
<P>
   He said some believe the eclipse could cause earthquakes, and a
religious committee warned people to wear white clothes that
reflect the sun's rays.
</P>
<P>
   Most Palestinians consider the eclipse nothing more than a minor
threat to eye safety. But, special eclipse-related prayers, calling
on God's mercy and protection, are planned in many mosques from
about noon until about 4 p.m. (local time) Wednesday. The eclipse
peaks here at 2:41 p.m. (local time) with 80 percent coverage of
the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian Authority Minister of Health Riad Zanoon Sunday
declared a ``state of emergency'' in local health facilities and
warned people not to use use the day off for trips to the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tony Morgan, an ophthalmologist at Jerusalem's St. John's
Hospital for the Eyes, said he backed the warnings to stay inside
for families with children who might get curious and gaze at the
phenomenon. He noted, though, that the rays of an eclipse are no
stronger than the sun's normal rays.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis, meanwhile, peppered the approach of the solar event --
the last full eclipse of the millennium -- with their usual dash of
politics. Many are headed to the Golan Heights, land captured from
Syria in 1967, thought to be a prime viewing spot because of its
northern location and high altitude.
</P>
<P>
   The right-wing Likud Party is holding an eclipse rally there,
using the occasion to kick off a campaign against the proposed
return of the land to Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Farther off in Iran, which has more than 60 cities in the direct
line of the eclipse's so-called Path of Totality, residents are
looking forward to a commercial boom.
</P>
<P>
   European tourists are flocking to the tourism-hungry country.
Newspapers noted that the visitors even include a team of
astronomers from the United States, often maligned as the home of
``World Arrogance'' by Iranian politicians.

AIRLINES AND FLIERS DESERVE RESPECT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Syd Kearney, my colleague, relates a recent experience with a
flight from New Orleans to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers boarding the aircraft were in a festive mood _
Imagine that. In New Orleans? _ but one woman's demeanor, to put it
kindly, extended beyond accepted behavior.
</P>
<P>
   When a flight attendant, then the pilot, threatened to remove
her prior to departure, the passenger finally took her seat. But
she created more commotion en route, then ignored pleas to remain
seated as the jet taxied to the gate upon arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you believe,'' the harried flight attendant sighed as
Kearney debarked, ``that these people are demanding a passenger
rights bill?''
</P>
<P>
   At least this passenger didn't try to kick or strangle anybody,
the plight of too many flight attendants recently.
</P>
<P>
   But the episode underscores the growing tension in the
not-so-friendly skies.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, ``air rage'' has escalated at an alarming _ and
dangerous _ rate. One employee for Houston-based Continental
Airlines was critically injured during a scuffle with a passenger
at Newark, N.J., several days ago, prompting airline president
Gordon Bethune to call for legislation banning violent fliers from
U.S. airlines. Six people, including a Delta flight attendant, were
injured during an in-flight altercation. In another incident, a
passenger tried, without success, to open an exit door midair.
</P>
<P>
   There is no excuse for such abusive behavior. And no reason for
airlines to tolerate it. Bans. Fines. Jail. Whatever it takes,
innocent passengers _ the vast majority _ need protection along
with airline employees.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, travelers have been clamoring all year for
better treatment from airlines. After several legislators
introduced passenger rights bills, the airlines vowed to address
concerns and make adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, these two issues _ air rage and passenger rights
_ may seem largely unrelated. Just because a flight is delayed and
we're provided misleading information about the reasons, we don't
have the right to punch out the gate agent. Just because we're
squeezed into a middle seat, idled on the tarmac for two hours and
fed only peanuts, we're not obliged to scream at a flight
attendant.
</P>
<P>
   We're still a nation of laws. And common decency.
</P>
<P>
   But the attendant on Kearney's flight was wrong to equate all
passengers with the actions of a small minority.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SECURITY NEEDED &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So what do we do about air rage other than invoke stronger
punishment and hope it serves as a deterrent? Flight attendants are
trained in safety first, then in service; they aren't
law-enforcement personnel and shouldn't be charged with the
responsibility of maintaining order. Certainly, 911 calls don't
accomplish much at 37,000 feet. Airlines tell us they can't afford
to place uniformed police aboard every aircraft, at least not
without raising fares significantly. And I can imagine the outcry
from flight attendants _ already unduly victimized _ if even one
were replaced so that security officers were integrated as a
routine part of on-board crews.
</P>
<P>
   But think about it. How many other public forums this huge _
hundreds of thousands of travelers on airplanes worldwide every day
_ aren't protected by clearly recognizable authority figures? It's
sad that we must entertain the thought, but what price is a flight
attendant's safety? Or life? A passenger's security?
</P>
<P>
   What we can and must do is focus squarely on the root causes. My
theory is that much of the disturbing behavior _ not all of it;
some people, alas, are simply crazy _ mirrors our overall
fast-paced and angst-ridden society and is influenced by the
remarkable growth in popularity of air travel for the masses.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, the pages of this newspaper include reports of
violence in and around our city born of pressure or tension. Of
people feeling crowded and put upon. Of involvement with alcohol or
drugs _ or both. Of confusion and conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Is modern-day air travel any different?
</P>
<P>
   For a recent story, Washington Post reporter Don Phillips took
18 domestic flights in 21 days, and one significant finding was
experiencing seven ``delay'' points _ from a traffic jam en route
to the airport to long lines in the departure lounge _ prior to
takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, we're often frustrated even before boarding a
flight. Then, because airlines are determined to milk every drop of
potential passenger revenue _ and because we keep buying tickets in
record numbers _ we're jammed into seats as if we were cattle. With
so many airplanes needed to satisfy demand, we wait sometimes for
an hour to take off. Chances are, we face pressures at our
destination. If our flight is late or if weather is bad and the
ride bumpy, the tension multiplies. And some fliers resort to booze
or pills, or a combination, in a misguided attempt to calm nerves.
</P>
<P>
   In short _ and don't misunderstand, this does not justify rage _
many passengers aboard an airplane today are not in the best of
moods. They're not mad at the flight attendant; they're upset at
the system (a system whose faults sometimes are beyond the
airline's control).
</P>
<P>
   Neither are flight attendants and gate agents always bubbly with
enthusiasm, understandable in that they don't relish being cursed,
doused with liquor _ or worse.
</P>
<P>
   We need to work together to find ways to make the overall air
travel experience _ from booking a reservation to easing delays to
claiming baggage _ less pressure-packed.
</P>
<P>
   I remember when people eagerly looked forward to flying as one
of life's truly special experiences. In practical terms, it was
also available to only a select few. Today, moving about the world
in a jetliner is affordable to more travelers than ever. It's
safer, too. But it's rarely special.
</P>
<P>
   This is simplistic, I know, and perhaps, given the horrible
massacres in schools and office buildings, it's a wasted wish: But
a little more mutual respect for each other _ airlines and
passengers _ couldn't hurt.

WHY CHINESE ARE FORCED TO ARGUE IN ENGLISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 15)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   We believe there is one nation and two countries,'' said Chen
Chien-jen, chief spokesman of the Republic of China on Taiwan,
speaking in English.
</P>
<P>
   Seth Faison, The New York Times' man in Beijing, asked him to
say that in Chinese. Chen was stumped. ``We are still looking for
the right words,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because in Chinese,  &UR; state &LR; ,  &UR; country &LR;  and  &UR; nation &LR;  are
expressed in the same word:  &UR; guojia &LR; , pronounced gwo-jah. But the
Chinese leaders on Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade
province of China, want to put a few degrees of separation between
the two political entities. How to do this without declaring
independence, which might start a war? ``So they use the English
words,'' writes Faison, ``even though Taiwan is a Chinese-speaking
country, or state, or nation _ or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Chinese language often uses pronunciation to express
different nuances of meaning, the English language has a glorious
range of synonymy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Nation &LR; , from the Latin of the same name, stems from ``breed,
stock, race'' _ leading to the notion of ``a people.'' When we
speak of the Iroquois Nation, or the Nation of Islam, we mean the
culture, religion, race and/or language that binds people who may
be dispersed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hates our sacred  &UR; nation &LR; ,'' says Shylock in Shakespeare's
``Merchant of Venice.'' (The Chinese word for this racial sense is
 &UR; minzu &LR; .) Although that early sense is still in use, in the last
two centuries the primary meaning of  &UR; nation &LR;  has shifted to ``an
independent political unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that later sense the same as a  &UR; country &LR; ? Yes. Its Latin root
is  &UR; contra &LR; , ``against,'' originally the land or region separate
from, or up against, other discrete areas. Though it has a second
sense of ``bucolic region'' as in ``I can't stand the beach; let's
go to the country,'' the primary meaning is ``an independent state;
native land.'' (U.S. presidents traditionally began their inaugural
addresses with ``My countrymen'' until it was desexed to ``Fellow
citizens.'')
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the old meaning of  &UR; nation &LR;  can be used to make a
contrast with the new meaning of  &UR; country &LR; , as in: ``The Kurds are
the largest  &UR; nation &LR;  in the world without a  &UR; country &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Note the use above of ``independent state.'' The use of the
modifier  &UR; independent &LR;  shows that  &UR; state &LR;  need not be wholly
separate from a  &UR; nation &LR; . The 50 American states are not sovereign,
no matter what they say in Texas and Hawaii (the only states that
were once sovereign nations).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; State &LR; , from the French  &UR; etat &LR; , ``class, ranking,'' is a unit
of government that may or may not be independent, which is why it
requires a qualifier. Palestinians, for example, rarely say they
want a state; they specify an independent, or separate, or ``our
own'' state.
</P>
<P>
   Now we can see what the spokesman for Taiwan was getting at when
he said ``one  &UR; nation &LR;  and two  &UR; countries &LR; .'' He meant the early
sense of  &UR; nation &LR;  _ in this case, ``the Chinese people'' _ with one
part of that people on Taiwan set up against,  &UR; contra &LR; , in a
country next to but apart from the mother country.
</P>
<P>
   Mainland China is not having any of this English linguistic hair
splitting. It insists on ``one China,'' a fiction of both sides
that U.S. policy gladly acknowledged in the Shanghai Communique of
1972, provided ultimate reunification would be peaceful. The point
here is that Chinese prefer their own language to gloss over
differences but turn to English to introduce degrees of difference.
Our language is as subtle as their minds.

   JAIL MAIL
</P>
<P>
   Though the spy Aldrich Ames has been falling behind in his
correspondence with this column, a new jailbird has taken his
place.
</P>
<P>
   From confinement in Eastlake, Mich., comes this whimsical poem
from the inmate Dr. Jack Kevorkian:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Whenever language gets frowzy, &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Irregular mavens quite tousey &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Use their NIT-picking pride &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; As ``insecticide'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To kill solecisms that are LOUSY. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The play on  &UR; nit &LR;  as an egg of a  &UR; louse &LR;  is obvious, but the
 &UR; frowzy-tousey &LR;  rhyme deserves scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Frowzy &LR;  _ meaning ``musty, smelly'' _ can be found in the poet
John Dryden's ``With  &UR; Frowzy &LR;  Pores, that taint the ambient Air.''
A more recent sense is ``dingy, slatternly, unkempt,'' and my
medical correspondent nicely applies this sense of sloppiness to
language criticized in this space.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tousey &LR;  is on a road less traveled. It, too, means
``disheveled, shaggy.''
</P>
<P>
   Most often seen in modern language as  &UR; tousled &LR; , ``rumpled,''
its origin is in the verb  &UR; touse &LR; , now rare, ``to push around,
handle roughly,'' as in Shakespeare's ``We'll  &UR; touze &LR;  you joynt by
joynt.'' It is the source of the noun  &UR; tussle &LR; , ``minor fight;
scuffle.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Kevorkian contribution on the vagaries of pronunciation
in English:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The ubiquitous diphthong o-u &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Is tough to pronounce for there's coup, &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Slough, dough, ought, rough &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; All, of course, joust enough &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To becloud a dour nous when &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; you're through. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In encouraging him thus, am I engaged in assisted linguicide?
</P>
<P>
   ACRONYMANIA
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa, an organization that hands out free condoms to
prostitutes calls itself the Sex Worker Education and Advocacy
Taskforce (SWEAT).

<P>
   In Chicago, an anti-drug outfit calls itself Children Requiring
a Caring Kommunity (CRACK).

UNSIGHTLY WEBBING ACTUALLY HELPS TREES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What is the web that is starting to cover trunks and heavy
branches of oak trees, and what should we do if it is a hazard to
the trees' health? From the street it looks like a trickle of water
coming down the trunk. Closer inspection shows a fine, white,
smooth web.
</P>
<P>
   A: The same webbing is now on our crape myrtles, and it is the
protective covering of bark lice, beneficial insects that clean
bugs and fungi from our trees. I would let them do their work, and
eventually they will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have an 8-foot angel's trumpet that bloomed two times in
the spring. The summer rains came _ every day for weeks _ and my
beautiful plant turned yellow and shed leaves. Some new leaves are
coming on, but there are no signs of blooming. Please tell me if
there is anything I can do.
</P>
<P>
   A: One cause of yellow, dropping leaves is too much moisture. It
could be that your soil usually drains adequately but could not
quite accommodate all the extra rain. You can improve the drainage,
if you feel it's necessary, by working in a little sand and
compost. Sometimes great fluctuations in moisture will cause
yellowing leaves.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds as if your tree is on the rebound. Give it time to put
on new foliage _ and the temperatures time to drop a little _ and
I'll bet your plant begins to flower again. My angel's trumpet
blooms are most abundant when it's not so hot.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have several fig trees in my large, shady back yard. They
seem healthy but do not produce figs. Do they need fertilizer? Or
do they need more sun?
</P>
<P>
   A: Fig trees need abundant sun to be productive. A full or
nearly full day is ideal. These plants thrive in deep, organically
enriched soil. They need a lot of water, but good drainage is
necessary. And they benefit greatly from a heavy layer of mulch.
Given these conditions, there is usually no need to fertilize.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to inadequate sunlight, other causes of poor fruit
production are:
</P>
<P>
   Fig trees may show vigorous vegetative growth at the expense of
fruiting. So once a fast-growing plant slows, it should produce
figs.
</P>
<P>
   Stress can slow or prevent fruit production, so give figs plenty
of water and keep them heavily mulched. Lack of water causes fruit
to drop.
</P>
<P>
   Fig trees will produce best with little or no pruning.
</P>
<P>
   Fig trees usually need two to three years to mature and bear.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There are spider webs in some of my trees. Some are large,
and some look like they are just beginning to grow. Please tell me
what to do.
</P>
<P>
   A: Tent caterpillars produce webs in trees in spring. Fall
webworms spin large webs later in the summer. The latter especially
like pecans.
</P>
<P>
   Tent caterpillars often produce webs where limbs join the trunk,
and the larvae crawl out and eat the leaves. Fall webworms produce
silky webs on the ends of the branches. The caterpillars eat the
leaves within the webs, and as the foliage disappears, the
caterpillars enlarge the web to encase more leaves. While an
infestation is unsightly, the trees usually rebound.
</P>
<P>
   We can forget the tent caterpillar for now, but we can treat
current webworm outbreaks. Spray and penetrate webbed foliage with
a pesticide. Bacillus thuringiensis, or Bt, is one effective
treatment. It is difficult to treat tall trees unless you have a
high-pressure sprayer.
</P>
<P>
   Bt and other pesticides will harm butterfly larvae, so aim
carefully or use extended limb trimmers to cut out the webs.
Destroy these right away.
</P>
<P>
   Fall webworms spend winter in dark-brown cocoons, often attached
to a trunk, or in organic matter on the ground. The moths emerge in
the spring or summer. They lay their eggs, and in approximately 10
days the larvae begin their work.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have lost all the trees in my back yard to pine bark
beetles. What would be a good, fast-growing tree that would provide
shade in a short amount of time?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would visit a nursery that specializes in trees and study
the appearance, growth habits and sizes of various trees. Keep in
mind that fast-growing trees can have weaker wood that is more
subject to wind damage.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-growing Drummond red maple provides abundant shade and
will grow in partial shade or in full sun, in sand, clay or loam.
This native tree also is tolerant of poorly draining soil. As it
stretches toward a possible height of 90 feet, the smooth, gray
bark becomes fissured into ridges. Fast-growing trees may have
shorter lives than slower-growing trees _ the Drummond should live
about 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most interesting trees native to Texas is the river
birch, which provides filtered shade. Often multitrunked, this
graceful tree has beautiful silvery-cinnamon bark that peels in
papery sheets.
</P>
<P>
   As its name implies, the river birch likes moisture and is a
good weapon against erosion. This tree is a natural for the poorly
draining soils of Houston, but I've seen it do well in a raised bed
and in drier conditions. The river birch is also a fast grower, in
sun or partial shade, and can reach a height from 30 to 90 feet.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many great trees, I would take the time to look at
several now while they have their foliage. These include the green
ash, `Drake' elm and the swamp chestnut oak, which provides fairly
good fall color.
</P>
<P>
   After selecting the one best for your needs, plant the tree this
fall. You can, of course, plant a container-grown tree most any
time, but it's so hot and dry now, transplanting stress will be
greater.

 THERE WAS LIFE BEFORE THE CARDINALS FOR McGWIRE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN SHEA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Will anyone remember that Mark McGwire hit his
first 363 home runs with the Oakland A's?
</P>
<P>
   Or 49 homers as a rookie? Or 50 in his final full season in
Oakland? Or used to take batting practice in peace? Or played in
the A's organization for 13 1/2 years?
</P>
<P>
   We've seen so much of McGwire the last two seasons that it's
become difficult to picture him in any color but St. Louis red. No
doubt he'll be remembered more for what he did in a Cardinals
jersey than an A's jersey, even though he helped Oakland to three
World Series and hasn't gotten a sniff of the playoffs in St.
Louis, where fans seem to act as if they've had the guy all along
and watched every one of those 500 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   At least A's fans can rest assured that St. Louis _ even though
the talk is that McGwire would go into the Hall of Fame as a
Cardinal _ wouldn't have celebrated No. 500 without a huge assist
from Oakland, where it all started.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't something that just happened,'' said Jim Lefebvre,
one of McGwire's batting coaches with the A's. ``Seventy was
something new, but he has hit them in the 50s for a while. The only
thing that set him back was injuries. Now he's healthy and he's
showing what he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis has cashed in on the blood and sweat sacrificed by
McGwire, who missed practically two full seasons in Oakland with
foot injuries and considered retiring because his professional and
personal lives were a mess.
</P>
<P>
   Now all is well as he ponders 600 and maybe 700. He's 35 and
still in his prime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've exceeded every expectation I've ever had for myself,''
McGwire said. ``I almost gave this game up. It's the ones who
overcome adversity who stay the strongest. And I give credit to my
mind. My mind is so strong in that box. I am so focused.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is one of 16 players in the 500 club, and no one got
there faster. He needed 5,487 at-bats, an average of one homer
every 11.23 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as home runs per at-bat, he's the all-time leader,''
Lefebvre said. ``That's all you need to know.''

GRAHAM TURNS HEADS AS HOLLYWOOD'S LATEST FUNNY GIRL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Blending sexiness, comic giddiness and blond
tresses has been a successful Hollywood recipe for the few
actresses who get the mix just right.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Monroe tops a short list of actresses _ Judy Holliday,
Carole Lombard and Goldie Hawn _ who have made a career of playing
blondes who can turn a tease into titters.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Cameron Diaz auditioned for the list. Heather Graham
is the latest pretender to the golden giggles club.
</P>
<P>
   Graham certainly has the hair and the come-hither style. But
that's just part of the formula.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Graham takes a shot at the final ingredient in two
comedies. She's already grabbed laughs and magazine covers as a
sexy secret agent in ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.'' Her
next comedy, ``Bowfinger,'' has her flirting funny opposite Steve
Martin and Eddie Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   As Felicity Shagwell in ``Austin Powers,'' she's a hip '60s CIA
agent willing to sleep with anyone _ and we do mean anyone _ to do
her job or get a laugh. That included shooting a gross-out love
scene with star Mike Myers while he was wearing the body suit for
400-pound Scottish assassin Fat Bastard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really looking forward to that day,'' Graham says, in
what is presumably disguised sarcasm. ``It was really special. We
really bonded. It was kind of embarrassing because I got a little
overheated, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarcastic or not, Graham passed muster with Myers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heather was great,'' he says of working with her. ``She's very
silly, likes to laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Bowfinger,'' she's Daisy, a wholesome-looking Midwestern
girl who seems all naivete when she hits Hollywood looking to
become a star. But Daisy also considers her sexual charms,
liberally shared, the key to getting what she wants.
</P>
<P>
   Catching her having sex with another man, Bowfinger (Martin),
one of her many lovers, accusingly says to Daisy, ``You slept with
him!''
</P>
<P>
   ``So?'' answers Daisy with so much innocence that Bowfinger can
only mumble, ``I never looked at it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The two roles go a long way to establish Graham as the comely
comic of the hour. But does Graham have the desire to be pegged as
cinema's sexy comedian?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty fun,'' Graham says in a high, sharp voice often
punctuated with giggling that sounds less than spontaneous. ``I
mean, like I want to play a range of different things. As long as
you're not only just sexy and racy, that there are other aspects to
you, it's good, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Graham sometimes sounds as if she's still auditioning for the
role: highly energetic, silly and a bit, well, scattered. But
perhaps it's just the voice and patter. One hopes so, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   We caught up with Graham in Los Angeles just before ``Austin
Powers'' opened in June, and again by phone a few days ago, as she
was touting ``Bowfinger.''
</P>
<P>
   In L.A., Graham, 29, is dressed considerably less provocatively
than as Felicity Shagwell in ``Austin Powers'' and less innocently
than as Daisy in ``Bowfinger:'' a black top, slit up the sides,
over black Capri pants and gray slip-on shoes. Sorry, no crocheted
peekaboo '60s outfit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had the guts,'' she says. ``I loved the boots. But
now that I've worn them in a movie, it would seem pretty stupid if
I was walking around wearing my character's wardrobe.''
</P>
<P>
   The dark duds contrast with Graham's pale face _ energized a bit
by pink blush and lipstick _ and her long, straight, light hair.
Rather tall, her height is emphasized by her thinness. Her long
fingers _ which restlessly push back wayward curling strands of
hair, _ end in unadorned nails, cut short.
</P>
<P>
   Graham considers her breakthrough part the teen-looking porn
star Rollergirl, yet another mix of sexuality, innocence and humor,
in 1997's controversial ``Boogie Nights.'' But she was already a
Hollywood veteran of two dozen movies. She began doing small movie
and TV roles at age 16 and had a significant role in ``Drugstore
Cowboy'' in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I had been acting before then in school,'' she says.
``I guess I just always admired movies, and it was a way for me to
get attention and distinguish myself. I always got to play cool
parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Early this year Graham was named 1999 Female Star of Tomorrow at
ShoWest, the film industry's annual convention.
</P>
<P>
   Her films include ``Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me''; ``Six
Degrees of Separation,'' with then-newcomer Will Smith; the
con-artist film ``Diggstown`` (co-star James Woods became her lover
for a while, though he was 45, she was 22); Even Cowgirls Get the
Blues; Swingers; Lost in Space (during which she became
romantically involved with director Stephen Hopkins); and ''Scream
2.``
</P>
<P>
   She also got attention for her acting _ and other things _ in
``Two Girls and a Guy,'' a distinctive three-character independent
film comedy drama. Graham and Robert Downey had a sex scene that
had no nudity but was so enthusiastic it almost got the movie an
NC-17 rating. It was trimmed after being submitted to the rating
board repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for her role as the teen porno star Rollergirl, a
part that was rewritten to be larger when Graham was signed, she
watched the filming of a real porn movie, an experience, she says,
that left her first shocked, then bored.
</P>
<P>
   Graham was born in Milwaukee and raised a Roman Catholic in
Virginia and Los Angeles. Her father was in the FBI, though she
says she doesn't know much about what he did, and her mother a
schoolteacher and writer.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Austin Powers'' and ``Bowfinger,'' Graham apprenticed her
comedy talents with three of the most successful comedians in film:
Mike Myers, Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy. She found each had a
different approach to his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike is new to it, really excited and enjoying his success. He
really keeps the crew laughing,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The first day working with Myers, she was left dazzled by his
improvisation of scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of shocked,'' she says. ``He sort of went off
(making up things), and I just went `Oh my God.' But you just have
to enjoy it. I just try to think about the story because you could
drive yourself crazy, probably.''
</P>
<P>
   Working on ``Bowfinger'' was a lot saner, since Martin wrote the
script, there were two weeks to rehearse, and Murphy is an old
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie's been around awhile. But he's funny and confident and
more quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve's been around the longest. I wouldn't say he's more
restrained or intellectual, though in his personality he's very
intellectual. Steve is definitely going for a sophisticated style
of comedy. I felt like he was doing his own vision.''
</P>
<P>
   When Graham's character first arrives in ``Bowfinger,''
literally getting off the bus in true Hollywood tradition, she
seems naive to the ways of the world, which endears her to every
man she meets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she was innocent to the ways of moviemaking,'' Graham
says, ``but I don't know if she was so innocent to the ways of
life. She has an idea how to get what she wants, even if she hasn't
done it.''
</P>
<P>
   From her recent experience playing sexy roles, Graham concludes
that Americans have some odd attitudes about sex and the movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can blow someone's head off, rip their heart out of their
chest, explode 500 bodies in front of your eyes, but if you show
someone having sex, it's incredibly racy,'' Graham says.

   Audiences won't have to wait long after ``Bowfinger'' to see
more of Graham. She has several films finished or in production. In
``Committed,'' she plays a wife who refuses to give up on the

PERSONAL HEALTH: SMALL, CONVENIENT AND FLEXIBLE, INSULIN PUMPS
CATCH ON 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though only 9 years old, Samantha Stevens, a patient at the
Joslin Center for Diabetes at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center
in New York, is already convinced that the insulin pump she uses
has changed her life, ``and I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   As she explained in an essay, ``Before I had the pump, I
couldn't go on sleepovers unless my mom came over to measure out my
insulin! When I was on shots, I had to eat every meal and snack
even if I wasn't hungry! With my pump, if I'm not hungry, I just
don't eat until later. With the pump, I don't have a lot of lows or
high blood sugar anymore, also I feel much better. The pump is one
of the best things that happened to me after I got diabetes.''
</P>
<P>
   Samantha is not alone in her praise of a device that can make
the life of people with insulin-dependent diabetes more normal and
flexible while at the same time helping keep their blood sugar on a
more even keel. Nicole Johnson, the current Miss America, and Deana
Herrera, Miss New York 1998, also use insulin pumps to control
their diabetes, although Miss Johnson said she temporarily
disconnected hers during the contest's swimsuit competition.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Kahn, a 28-year-old management consultant in Boston, was
Samantha's age when she learned she had diabetes. Daily scheduled
insulin shots served her well through childhood, she said, but ``as
I grew up and life got more interesting and complicated, I needed
more shots and I began to resent the regimentation they demanded.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The shot I took at breakfast determined when and what I was to
eat for lunch, whether I was hungry or not,'' Ms. Kahn said.
``Scheduled eating is not possible with my job. I often have to
meet with clients at weird hours, and I can't be eating while
giving a presentation. Now, with the pump, I can eat when I'm
hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of having to eat according to a strict schedule and
include a certain amount of carbohydrates to match the insulin dose
she takes in the morning, Ms. Kahn, by using the pump can
administer exactly the right amount of insulin whenever she decides
to eat and whatever her choice of a meal.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50,000 people with insulin-dependent diabetes now use
the pump, but Ms. Kahn said many more could be helped by it. Some
are put off by common misconceptions.
</P>
<P>
   They think incorrectly that the pump is implanted and requires
surgery and that it is used only as a last resort, when a person's
diabetes cannot be controlled any other way. In addition, many,
perhaps most, doctors either don't know about the pump or don't
understand how it works.
</P>
<P>
   An insulin pump is appropriate only for people willing and able
to be responsible about controlling their diabetes. Although it is
the most accurate, precise and flexible insulin delivery system
available, it is not automatic. The patient determines when and how
much insulin the pump delivers based on careful monitoring of blood
glucose, the amount and kinds of foods eaten, the intensity and
duration of exercise and the presence of illness or emotional
stress.
</P>
<P>
   Used properly, however, the pump permits excellent control of
blood glucose while allowing users to live normal lives, free of
the strict scheduling demands required by conventional insulin
shots.
</P>
<P>
   The pump itself is about the size and shape of a pager and is
worn outside the body, either concealed under clothing or hooked to
a belt or waistband. Clear plastic tubing carries insulin from the
pump to the body, where it enters through a soft infusion unit
usually placed on the abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   Once every few days, the infusion set is changed, and only then
is a needle used to put the unit in place. The result resembles a
large Band-Aid from which a piece of tubing emerges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned at first about being attached to something 24
hours a day, but it turned out to be not a big deal,'' Ms. Kahn
said. ``The hardest things to cope with are bathing suits, fancy
dresses and pajamas, but I have managed to find interesting places
to hide the pump. And I can put it in a waterproof case or
disconnect it temporarily when I shower or go swimming.''
</P>
<P>
   At mealtimes or when a snack is eaten, the patient instructs the
pump to administer an appropriate amount of insulin to process
whatever foods might be consumed. The patient also programs the
pump to automatically deliver insulin every hour to suit individual
baseline needs.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, between meals, the pump behaves more like a normal
pancreas, which releases small amounts of insulin more or less
continuously to process sugars formed during metabolic processes.
And this baseline amount can be adjusted to deliver different
amounts at different times of the day.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ms. Kahn explained that with ordinary insulin
shots, she would wake up each morning with a blood glucose level
that was too high. To prevent this she would have to get up at 3
a.m. to inject more insulin. Now she can program the pump to
deliver slightly more insulin between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. and wake up
with a normal blood sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Also, when she wants to exercise, she can reduce the amount of
insulin the pump automatically delivers and during intense
activity, which rapidly uses blood glucose, she can suspend insulin
delivery temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Wide swings in blood glucose are dangerous. Extreme lows can
result in a loss of consciousness, and extreme highs can cause a
diabetic coma. Either can be fatal. In addition, over the years,
repeated high glucose levels can cause serious damage to vital
organs, blood vessels, nerves and eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, a major study sponsored by the National
Institutes of Health demonstrated that careful, consistent control
of blood sugar in people with insulin-dependent diabetes could
delay the onset and slow the progression of damage to the retina,
kidneys and nerves.
</P>
<P>
   In patients who tightly controlled their blood glucose (42
percent of whom did so using an insulin pump), the risk of eye
disease was reduced by 76 percent, kidney disease by 56 percent and
nerve disease by 60 percent, with such complications delayed by an
estimated 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, blood glucose monitoring was done indirectly by
testing how much sugar spilled into the urine. Now it can be
quickly, directly and reliably measured with a glucose monitor, a
small, very portable gadget that gives a digital read-out based on
the glucose level in a drop of blood from a finger stick. This
enables someone with diabetes to determine whether there is enough,
or too much, insulin on board.
</P>
<P>
   The person can then make the appropriate adjustments by
injecting more insulin or eating something to take up the excess
and bring blood glucose back to normal levels. Using the pump,
insulin adjustments can be made simply by pressing a button.
</P>
<P>
   Children can be taught to use the pump properly. The Joslin
Center reports that increasing numbers of children and adolescents
with diabetes are switching from traditional injections to insulin
pump therapy, and studies have shown that these pump users have
better glucose control, fewer unscheduled doctor visits and fewer
emergency hospital admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, children wearing a pump can exercise at any time
and eat and sleep whenever they want, all the while achieving
excellent control of blood glucose.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no age limit on who can use a pump, in young
children, parents must assume the responsibility for properly
programming the machine's insulin delivery.
</P>
<P>
   An insulin pump is considered especially appropriate for
patients who experience wide swings in blood glucose, women who are
pregnant or planning to become pregnant, those who exercise
consistently or travel often and those who have erratic work
schedules.

   Holes in the Cheese
</P>
<P>
   Question. What makes the holes in Swiss cheese?
</P>
<P>
   Answer. The holes are made by sizable bubbles of gas produced by
a special kind of bacterium in the cheese-ripening process.
</P>
<P>
   In making most kinds of cheese, according to ``On Food and
Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen,'' by Harold McGee
(Collier Books), there are three basic steps: making curds from
milk, concentrating the curds and ripening the curds.
</P>
<P>
   First, hungry bacteria, pure cultures of Streptococci and
Lactobacilli, feed on milk sugar, or lactose, and their digestive
processes make lactic acid. The acidic environment is favorable to
the action of a curdling agent like rennet, a material found in
cows' stomachs. The milk separates into the familiar curds and
whey.
</P>
<P>
   Then the solid curds are drained of most of the liquid whey and
cooked, pressed and salted to remove the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The final process, ripening, the breakdown of the curd into
simpler, tastier molecules, is left to the enzymes produced by a
number of microbes, including the molds that produce the veins in
blue cheese.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is evenly dispersed starter bacteria that finish off
Swiss-type cheeses, which are ripened from within by the starter
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   An additional strain of bacterium, Propionibacter shermanii, is
included in the starter. It lives on the lactic acid excreted by
the other bacteria and gives off prodigious amounts of carbon
dioxide gas, which collects in large pockets, or eyes, in the curd,
as well as propionic acid, which contributes to the favor.
</P>
<P>
   The characteristic holes fail to develop properly when the
casein (the bundles of protein molecules that clump into curds) has
been preheated in pasteurization. In the United States, Swiss-type
cheese is one of the few cheeses not made under rules providing
that cheeses aged less than 60 days at temperatures lower than 35
degrees Fahrenheit must be made from pasteurized milk.

   &UR; PROGNOSIS: Expecting the Best Is Good for the Heart &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Optimism and self-confidence may prove potent weapons in staving
off a recurrence of heart disease, if a new study by Carnegie
Mellon University researchers is any indication. Patients in the
study who had a positive outlook, greater self-control and higher
self-esteem after angioplasty surgery were less likely to suffer a
heart attack, undergo bypass surgery, or require a second
angioplasty in the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers reported their findings in the July-August issue
of the journal Psychosomatics. Dr. Vicki Helgeson, a psychology
professor at Carnegie Mellon, and Dr. Heidi Fritz of the University
of Pittsburgh gave self-evaluations to 298 patients _ 199 men and
99 women _ hospitalized for angioplasty to relieve blockage in
major arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Patients were asked how confident they were that they could
alter health-damaging behaviors like smoking, how much they
exercised, how optimistic or pessimistic they were in their outlook
on life, and how much support they received from family, friends
and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, the patients were interviewed again.
</P>
<P>
   Patients who were more pessimistic, scoring low on the
psychological measures, were nearly three times as likely to have
more arterial blockage as people with a sunnier approach, the
researchers found.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RISKS AND REMEDIES: Kidney Toxins in a Nice Cup of Herb Tea &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Two women taking Chinese herbal preparations to treat eczema
have suffered kidney failure, according to a report in the Aug. 7
issue of The Lancet, a British medical journal. The cases raise new
questions about the safety of the remedies, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our cases are of great concern, since the herbal preparations
were from different sources and were prescribed for eczema,'' wrote
Dr. Graham Lord, a clinical research fellow at the Imperial College
School of Medicine in London, and his colleagues at the Hammersmith
and Charing Cross Hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   In the first case, a 49-year-old woman, who had been taking an
herbal preparation in tablets for two years, complained to her
doctors of headaches and high blood pressure. The symptoms
progressed rapidly to renal failure, Lord wrote, and the woman had
a kidney transplant.
</P>
<P>
   In the second case, a 57-year-old woman who had been drinking an
herbal tea for six years, was admitted to the hospital with kidney
failure. She is still awaiting a kidney transplant.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail exchange, Lord explained that the remedies used by
the women were made from a mixture of many Chinese herbs. But both
preparations contained mu tong, a Chinese name that can refer to
three different plants.
</P>
<P>
   The mu tong used in the remedies the women took, a laboratory
found, contained aristolochic acid, a chemical toxic to human
kidneys. Aristolochic acid was also found in Chinese herbs added to
a slimming formula linked to an outbreak of kidney failure in
Belgium in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese herbal medicine practitioners in the United States say
mu tong is also sold here, usually mixed with other herbs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NUTRITION: Chocolate, a Sweet Way to Fight Illness? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, bite into that Hershey bar. Chocolate, a new report
indicates, contains high levels of catechins, substances with
antioxidant properties that may help fight cancer and heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ilja Arts of the National Institute of Public Health and
Environment in the Netherlands said she and her colleagues, authors
of a short report last week in The Lancet, did not expect to find
large amounts of catechins in chocolate. In fact, she said, they
set out to study tea.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have long suspected that tea, which also contains
catechins, may have a protective effect. But studies examining the
link between tea and reduced risk of disease have come up with
mixed results. And some studies, Dr. Arts said, even show an
increased risk with high tea consumption. To explore further, the
researchers looked for other foods that contained catechins. Dark
chocolate, they found, contained 53.5 milligrams per 100 grams,
about four times the amount of in brewed tea. Milk chocolate had
15.9 milligrams per 100 grams, just slightly more than tea.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean chocolate fights illness? ``We hope to clarify
whether or not catechins can protect against chronic diseases,''
Dr. Arts said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TREATMENT: Oxygen May Help Save Threatened Eyes &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Giving oxygen to patients with detached retinas while they await
remedial surgery may help decrease damage to the affected eyes,
according to a California researcher who has successfully tested
his theory on cats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that oxygen therapy reduces the amount of
damage to the photoreceptor cells of the retina,'' said Dr. Steven
K. Fisher, director of Neuroscience Research Institute at the
University of California at Santa Barbara. He suggests that
patients with retinal detachment be provided with oxygen
immediately upon diagnosis to protect cells until the retina is
reattached.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the August issue of The American Journal of
Ophthalmology, Fisher noted that photoreceptors, the
light-sensitive cells in the retina, have only one source of
oxygen, and if deprived, die rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   In 10 cats, Fisher reported, oxygen given immediately after
their retinas were surgically detached reduced damage to the eyes.
The researcher said he was planning additional research to see if
the same applied to humans.
</P>
<P>
   Retinal detachments occur mostly in middle-aged or older adults,
and in people with diabetes, but may also result from injuries in
sports like boxing and bungee jumping. Emergency surgery is usually
required, because a detached retina can lead to serious vision loss
or blindness.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gregory Dellone-Larkin, research director of the Department
of Emergency Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, acknowledged
the potential value of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   But he cautioned that too much oxygen could sometimes be
harmful, and in emphysema patients has led to death. He also said
that cat and human retinas differed substantially and recommended
more research.

   STARR-REPORT (Washington) _ In an NBC interview, Kenneth Starr
says he will almost certainly file a final report before election
day 2000, thus potentially complicating Hillary Clinton's political

   SURPLUS-PARTIES (Washington) _ The heated battle over how to use
projected federal budget surpluses has exposed deep rifts between
the two parties, both in political and economic terms. Most of the
fight is over the portion of the surplus generated by general tax
revenues, $996 billion. Republicans say the figure is so big that
the country can afford a $792 billion tax cut and still find plenty
of money for needs like adding a prescription drug benefit to
Medicare and increasing spending on the military. But Democrats
argue that the surplus projections are based on a series of
questionable premises: that the economy will avoid a protracted
downturn; that unexplained surges in revenue will continue, and
that the forecasting ability of budget analysts will prove far more
accurate than it has in the past. The biggest problem with the
projections, Democrats say, is that they assume an unrealistically
low level of increases in government spending. By Richard W.

   SCI-DOOMSDAY (Undated) _ Amid the summer news doldrums, what
could be more invigorating than a warning that physicists may be on
the verge of destroying the world? Luckily, this and similar alarms
can be taken with a large grain of salt, and viewed in the proper
light, disaster warnings can be fun. The idea that human beings

AN ARTIST'S WORK BLURS LINES BETWEEN ART AND SCIENCE

<P>
   We humans are remarkably capable of recognizing objects, but
science has no explanation for how we do it.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have long assumed, though, that we must see shape in
the same way at all sizes. Otherwise we would recognize our friend
or the letter ``a'' differently at each distance or size. Yet the
artist Chuck Close is exhibiting paintings that refute this
assumption, showing that size can dramatically affect what shape we
see.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of Close's paintings are of heads, produced by
photographing the subject, drawing a grid onto the photo and a
similar grid on a much larger canvas, and copying one square at a
time from photo to canvas. Close usually fills each square on his
canvas with a ``mark'' that preserves the average color, although
not the internal form, of the square on the photo.
</P>
<P>
   Seen from a great distance, the portrait is an accurate
reproduction of the photo. Looking at Bill II (1991), reproduced at
one-third actual size, or any of Close's paintings from 1987 to
1997 at their actual size, one can move forward and back, again and
again, and the face, solid from afar (greater than eight feet),
always collapses into flat marks when seen from near.
</P>
<P>
   The observer is crossing a threshold. This duality _ solid from
far and flat from near _ shows that size affects perceived shape,
disproving the popular assumption of size independence.
</P>
<P>
   As reported in the current issue of Science, to investigate
further, my students and I measured this effect with the paintings
in the Chuck Close retrospective exhibition, now at the Hayward
Gallery in London.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit has scores of block portraits with a wide range of
marks per face, face size, mark size and mark type, which include
watercolor dots, fingerprints and ink stick scribbles.
</P>
<P>
   We asked each observer, while looking at the painting, to move
forward and backward to find the viewing distance at which the nose
emerges from the canvas. From afar, the side-lit nose appears to
stick out from the canvas. As the viewer approaches, the nose
suddenly collapses, becoming a flat patch of unevenly colored skin.
</P>
<P>
   The results show that the duality depends on a component we call
visual mark size, which is simply the width of the mark relative to
the viewer's distance from the painting. Portraits of all sizes are
seen as flat when seen from more than 200 mark widths away; they
appear solid when seen from less than 200 mark widths.
</P>
<P>
   There are well-known antecedents to Close's block paintings,
like the block portrait of Lincoln published in 1973 by two
scientists, Dr. Leon Harmon and Dr. Bela Julesz; Dr. Richard
Gregory's dalmatian photo; the pointillist paintings, and the
ancient mosaics at Pompeii.
</P>
<P>
   But they all had small blocks, less than half an inch wide, not
big enough to disintegrate readily into flat marks at ordinary
viewing distances, so viewers did not experience the duality seen
in Close's recent work.
</P>
<P>
   Can the duality be explained by optical blur? By taking off
one's glasses (or putting on someone else's), one can blur the
image, wiping out the grid, which reveals the face, as viewers of
Close's paintings often discover for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Vision scientists have supposed that increasing the viewing
distance reveals the face simply because it increases the eye's
blur enough to wipe out the grid. However, as readers can confirm
by looking at Bill II, one need only back up 8 feet to see the nose
and face emerge, far short of the great distance of 32 feet needed
to wipe out the grid. The duality cannot be explained by blur; it's
perceptual.
</P>
<P>
   Can art be science? Close, as an artist, has been studying the
effect of size from the beginning:
</P>
<P>
   (italics)``The self portrait from 1967-68 is the first portrait
head that I painted. THe idea was to make something that was so
large that it could not be readily seen as a whole and force the
viewer to scan the image in a Brobdingnagian way, as if they were
Gulliver's Lilliputians crawling over the surface of the face,
falling into a nostril and tripping over a mustache hair.''(end
italics)
</P>
<P>
   Close was more thorough than his scientific colleagues; the size
of the marks in his block portraits increased by 15 percent a year
from 1973 (quarter-inch) to 1997 (nearly four inches). He made sure
that exhibitions of his work would convey the idea, canceling a
retrospective that could not provide long viewing distances. He had
the idea and communicated it to the public, with compelling
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   So credit Close with discovering this size-dependent breakdown
of our ability to extract shape from shading.

   &UR; Scent Drives Animals Wild &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Science has discovered that Calvin Klein's Obsession is an
ocelot's too.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the Dallas Zoo, studying different scents as part
of a program to help protect a subspecies of ocelot in southern
Texas, discovered that the spotted cats responded more intensely to
Calvin Klein's Obsession for Men cologne than to several natural
attractants. ``They roll and rub and drool and lick for several
minutes,'' said Cynthia Bennett, the zoo's research curator.
</P>
<P>
   The idea to test Obsession came on a lark. The zoo's gorillas
love the perfume advertising strips found in magazines, Dr. Bennett
said, so one day her research assistant brought in a Calvin Klein
strip for the ocelots.
</P>
<P>
   There are only about 100 to 150 of the Texas subspecies left,
and their favored habitat, thorny scrub underbrush, is
disappearing. The goal of the research is to use scents to guide
the ocelots to more favorable habitats and encourage breeding.
</P>
<P>
   Attractants will also be used to help take an accurate census of
the cats. When the animals rub against a scented spot, they deposit
hair follicles that can be used, through DNA testing, to identify
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bennett does not plan to use Obsession directly, but rather
will analyze its components. She already has a good idea that it is
the musk in the cologne that is driving the cats wild.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other attractants tested were rat and bobcat feces.
``Calvin Klein didn't have a lot of competition, if you think about
it,'' Dr. Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dirt's Cleansing Effects &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to eating, even parrots can occasionally
overindulge. And just as a person can turn to an antacid or other
remedy, a parrot, it turns out, can turn to clay.
</P>
<P>
   Many vertebrates (including people in some cultures) eat soil, a
behavior known as geophagy. While it is not clear exactly why it
occurs, soil eating has, among other things, been thought to aid
digestion through grinding in the digestive tract, add minerals to
the diet, and remove toxins that are found in certain foods.
</P>
<P>
   In the Peruvian Amazon, macaws and other parrots frequent the
cliff walls of eroding riverbanks, where they seek out specific
clay soils, eating small chunks to supplement their usual fare of
seeds. Researchers from the Wildlife Conservation Society, the
Oceanic Society and the University of California at Davis set out
to study the biochemical functions of this behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In one experiment, they fed a group of macaws a harmless
compound mixed with Amazonian clay, and another group the compound
alone. The results, reported in The Journal of Chemical Ecology,
showed that the clay-eating group never developed high levels of
the compound in the blood, while the other group did.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that the clay did little to aid digestion
through grinding or add minerals to the diet, and did not
appreciably reduce the acidity of gastric juices, another common
theory. But by removing compounds through adsorption, the clay
enables the birds to vary their diets by eating toxin-containing
seeds, which are plentiful in the Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; World Champion Robots &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A five-robot team from Cornell University has won the 1999 Robot
World Cup soccer championship (small size division), played in
Stockholm at the same time as an international conference on
artificial intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament featured 18 teams in the division for robots less
than 7 inches in diameter, which competed on a table-tennis table,
passing and shooting an orange golf ball. The robots incorporated
sensors, computers and radios to work as a team without human
control.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell, which defeated the Free University of Berlin 15-0 in
the finals, went undefeated, including a come-from-behind victory
against a Korean team made possible when Cornell's human crew
realized that a chair was casting a shadow that confused the robot
goalie.

   The solar eclipse that will sweep across Europe, the Middle East
and the Indian subcontinent on Wednesday promises to be one of the
most watched in history. The European portion of the itinerary
alone reads like one of those if-it's-Tuesday-it-must-be-Belgium
tours: Cornwall, Paris, Stuttgart, Munich, Vienna, Budapest and
Bucharest are all within or near the 60-mile-wide path of totality,
where the moon will completely cover the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Even people in the northeastern United States will have a chance
to see a partial eclipse at sunrise, weather permitting. In New
York, about one-third of the sun will be obscured when it rises at
6:02 a.m., with coverage diminishing to zero in a half-hour.
Farther north and east, the situation improves. In Boston, for
example, the sun will be about two-thirds covered when it rises at
5:47.
</P>
<P>
   Experts caution that even a partial eclipse can harm the eyes.
It should be viewed through a special solar filter (sunglasses or
photographic filters are inadequate) or by projecting the image
through a pencil-size hole in a piece of cardboard onto a sheet of
paper.
</P>
<P>
   The eclipse comes near what is known as solar maximum, the end
of an 11-year cycle when flares and other events increase. So the
corona, the sun's outer atmosphere that is only visible during a
total eclipse, may be particularly spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   But astronomers also hope to learn more about why the corona is
so hot _ millions of degrees, when the sun's surface is a mere
6,000. Data from research spacecraft have suggested that magnetic
fields near the surface may play a role.
</P>
<P>
   A team from Williams College is in Ramnicu-Valcea, Romania,
where the duration of totality will be the longest at just under
two and a half minutes, to try to observe rapid oscillations in the
corona that would be evidence of magnetic fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
   The team, led by Jay Pasachoff, the head of the school's
astronomy department, is working in conjunction with one of the
orbiting observatories, the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer.
But that spacecraft can take only one photograph every 10 seconds
or so; since the oscillations would be on the order of one every
second, the ability of the ground-based crew to make a rapid series
of images is critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a perfect example of how eclipse results can overlap and
collaborate with space results,'' Pasachoff said.

   The race to find an elusive but all-important particle called
the Higgs boson heated up last week when Europe's most powerful
accelerator reached an energy that may bring the target within
range.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its presumably vital importance to universal
existence, the Higgs boson was dubbed ``The God Particle'' in the
title of a book by Dr. Leon Lederman, a Nobel laureate in physics.
</P>
<P>
   The godlike importance ascribed to the Higgs is based on the
belief that its interactions endow all the constituents of matter
with mass; it is the universal giver of heft.
</P>
<P>
   To create the ephemeral Higgs in the laboratory requires a
collision of two ordinary particles _ protons or electrons _ so
their combined collision energy exceeds the energy of the Higgs.
Last Wednesday the European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN)
near Geneva announced it had successfully boosted the energy of its
10-year-old Large Electron-Positron accelerator to 100 billion
electron-volts.
</P>
<P>
   The achievement means that CERN can run its LEP accelerator
``flat out, during its last years of service,'' a spokesman said,
with electrons and antielectrons hitting each other at combined
energies of 200 billion electron-volts. If the lightest Higgs
particle weighs less than this, it may be created and found in a
matter of months.
</P>
<P>
   But if the lightest Higgs is marginally heavier than this, it
will be beyond the reach of the LEP accelerator, and the prize
might go to CERN's major rival, the Fermi National Accelerator
Laboratory at Batavia, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Fermilab recently completed a major upgrade of its Tevatron
proton-antiproton accelerator that will pump far more colliding
particles into its beams than was possible before. Many more
collisions will occur, giving Fermilab physicists a better chance
of finding the rare events expected to signal the creation and
discovery of Higgs bosons.
</P>
<P>
   There may be as many as five different Higgs particles working
together as part of the ``Higgs mechanism'' _ a hypothetical system
that could explain why all other particles have the masses they do.
</P>
<P>
   A study of the Higgs mechanism, if it is found, could also tidy
up known flaws in the ``Standard Model'' theory, which accounts for
the different types of quarks and leptons that make up all matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Higgs boson is named for Dr. Peter Higgs, a Scottish
theorist, who in the 1960s found hints of the particle's existence
in equations describing the known constituents of matter.
</P>
<P>
   No one can predict how massive the Higgs will turn out to be,
except that it must be very heavy. But the lightest possible Higgs
boson may weigh as little as 109 billion electron-volts _ somewhat
less than the mass of an atom of silver.
</P>
<P>
   If the lightest Higgs particle weighs a little more than an atom
of silver, the Europeans will fail to find a Higgs in the next few
months and Fermilab will have a good chance of making the discovery
a little later. Lederman, a former director of Fermilab, likens the
situation to a horse race.
</P>
<P>
   The competition between CERN and Fermilab for the Higgs particle
is reminiscent of a similar race in the 1980s for the W and Z
bosons _ ``vector'' particles that transmit the ``weak'' nuclear
force between other particles.
</P>
<P>
   The CERN proton accelerator's energy was barely sufficient for
the quest. But a Dutch physicist, Dr. Simon van der Meer, and
CERN's director at the time, Dr. Carlo Rubbia, found an ingenious
way to bunch colliding protons together, and the technique enabled
them to snag the W and Z bosons.
</P>
<P>
   Rubbia and van der Meer were awarded the 1984 Nobel Prize for
their discovery. Almost certainly, a Nobel Prize also awaits the
winner of the Higgs race.
</P>
<P>
   But both Europe's LEP accelerator and Fermilab's Tevatron are
past their prime.
</P>
<P>
   Next year CERN's LEP accelerator will shut down to make way for
a new accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider, which will occupy the
same circular 17-mile tunnel that now holds LEP. When the new
hadron collider begins operation in 2005 it will be by far the most
powerful and important accelerator in the world, easily
outdistancing Fermilab's capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   If the current search by Fermilab and CERN for the Higgs boson
turns up dry, CERN's new hadron machine will have a much better
chance of finding not only the Higgs but also one or more exotic
``supersymmetric'' particles.
</P>
<P>
   Many theorists believe that for every particle known to exist
there is a complementary particle that has yet to be discovered.
The discovery of such a supersymmetric particle would prompt a
revolution in physics.

BULLIES AND VICTIMS ARE ALIKE IN MAKEUP, STUDIES SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By SUSAN GILBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bullies are often pictured as brawny thugs, their victims as
bespectacled weaklings. But new research suggests that such
characterizations are at best misleading.
</P>
<P>
   Studies are finding that bullies and victims are often the same
people, being bullied one day and bullying the next. And children
who end up on either side of the bully-victim equation often suffer
from serious emotional problems, including depression, anxiety and
suicidal tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   In one study, for example, published last week in the British
Medical Journal, Dr. Riittakerttu Kaltiala-Heino, senior assistant
professor of social psychiatry at the University of Tampere in
Finland, surveyed 16,410 Finish students ages 14 to 16. Nearly
one-third of the children who admitted to bullying others
frequently, Dr. Kaltiala-Heino found, also said they were victims
of bullying. Most of the children who identified themselves as
bullies, victims, or both, she said, were boys.
</P>
<P>
   Using questionnaires designed to diagnose depression and assess
the risk of suicide, Dr. Kaltiala-Heino also found that bullies and
victims were more similar than different in their psychological
makeup. Depression was roughly as common among bullies as it was
among victims. And severe suicidal thoughts _ known to be common
among children who are victimized _ were even more prevalent among
bullies. Students were considered to have severe suicidal thoughts
if they agreed to either of two statements: ``I have definite plans
about committing suicide'' or ``I would kill myself if I had the
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Depression and suicidal thoughts, Dr. Kaltiala-Heino said, were
most common among the subgroup of children who frequently were
bullies as well as victims. For example, 44 percent of the girls
and 23 percent of the boys in this group were depressed, compared
with the 26 percent of girls and 16 percent of boys who were
victims only.
</P>
<P>
   A second study, appearing in the same issue of the journal,
reached similar conclusions. The researchers, who surveyed 3,918
Australian children, ages 11 to 15, reported that half the bullies
were also targets, and that most were boys. In this study the
bully-victim subgroup also had the poorest psychosocial profile.
``Bullies who are also bullied exhibit characteristics of both
these groups,'' said Chris Rissel, an epidemiologist at Central
Sydney Area Health Services in Australia, and a co-author of the
study.
</P>
<P>
   Bullies in the study evidenced high rates of smoking and
reported several psychological and psychosomatic symptoms,
including headaches, stomachaches, sadness and trouble in sleeping.
But children who identified themselves as both bullies and victims
had higher rates of these problems. Victims scored the highest on
measures of loneliness and were most likely to say they were
ostracized by other children. The subgroup scored a close second in
these categories.
</P>
<P>
   That a significant number of bullies in both studies said they
were also victims makes sense, the researchers and other experts in
the field said. ``Most psychologists agree that bullying and
aggression are learned behaviors,'' said Dr. Ronald D. Stephens,
executive director of the National School Safety Center, an
advocacy group in Westlake Village, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Susan Limber, assistant director at the Institute for
Families in Society at the University of South Carolina in
Columbus, said many bullies who are also victims may suffer from
attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, and as a result tend to
become irritable and combative. ``They may be targets of bullying
because of their own behavior but they also tend to bully other
children,'' Dr. Limber said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say it is not clear whether the incidence of
bullying is increasing. But studies confirm what most people, based
on their own experience, have always suspected: In the nation's
schools, physical and emotional intimidation is common.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 survey of 6,000 children in grades 4 to 6, for example,
showed that 1 in 4 reported that they had been bullied repeatedly
over several months. About 1 in 10 said they were bullied one or
more times a week. And 1 in 5 of the children admitted to being
bullies themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, researchers disagreed on exactly how bullying
should be defined. But most now describe it as any act of physical
or oral aggression by a person against someone who is weaker _ that
is, smaller, less popular, or less secure. Hitting, taunting, or
manipulating others into doing things against their will are
examples of bullying, as is ostracizing another person.
</P>
<P>
   And most experts agree that bullying is rarely a problem
children can work out on their own. Instead, they say, bullies and
victims need help from parents, schools and even therapists.
Otherwise, the bullying may increase and the emotional problems of
the children may become more severe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adults should never ignore bullying or explain it away,'' said
Dr. Kaltiala-Heino. ``The worst thing is to pretend that nothing
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the high rates of psychological symptoms associated with
bullying, the researchers said, a crucial step in reducing the
problem is for bullies and victims to get appropriate counseling.
Family doctors and other health care professionals can help, they
suggested, by asking their young patients about problems at school.
</P>
<P>
   But schools can also play a role by adopting anti-bullying
programs, which provide a forum for disciplining bullies, helping
parents to identify the signs of bullying and referring bullies and
their victims for counseling. One such program in Norwegian
schools, Dr. Limber said, cut bullying in half within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary results from a similar program, designed by Dr.
Limber and tested in 20 South Carolina middle schools in 1995,
indicate that bullying declined after one year. By contrast, she
said, bullying increased in a group of middle schools in the state
that did not use the program.

FOR WOMEN, NEW HOPES FOR ROMANCE

<P>
   Some women who need to take antidepressant medications find
themselves forced to make a difficult choice: treat their
depression or enjoy a satisfying sex life. Sexual dysfunction is a
common side effect of antidepressant treatment, and some women end
up deciding that taking the drugs is just not worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a new study of nine women suggests that sildenafil citrate,
marketed as Viagra, can help some women taking antidepressant drugs
recover the romantic side of their lives. The drug restored sexual
response all nine subjects, according to the study, which appears
in the August issue of Psychiatric Services. Before they began
taking sildenafil, the women in the study had no orgasms or only
reduced orgasms.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies have found that sildenafil is effective in
treating sexual response problems in men who are taking
antidepressants. The new study is very small, but it offers some
hope that sildenafil may also be effective for women.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. H. George Nurnberg, vice chairman of clinical psychiatry
programs at the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, said Viagra
might work by enhancing the blood flow that triggers sexual
response.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, the nine women took sildenafil one hour before
they engaged in sexual activity. All nine reported a significant
reversal of sexual dysfunction, usually after taking the first dose
of the drug. A 50-milligram dose of the medication worked for seven
of the nine patients; two patients required a 100-milligram dose.
Few side effects were reported by subjects in the study, according
to the researchers.
</P>
<P>
   An inability to reach orgasm, or a delay or reduction in orgasm,
develops in 45 percent to 60 percent of people who take
antidepressants, Nurnberg said. The problem is particularly common
in those taking selective serotonin uptake inhibitors, a class of
antidepressants that includes Prozac, Zoloft and other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Many people who suffer from depression take antidepressants for
long periods of time to prevent relapse, Nurnberg said. ``There's a
big danger that women, like men, will stop taking their
antidepressant medication because it interferes with sex,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies have indicated that sildenafil can be taken
safely with the class of drugs that includes Prozac. But Dr. Irwin
Goldstein, professor of urology at the Boston University School of
Medicine, cautioned that while sildenafil seemed promising, it was
not a cure-all.
</P>
<P>
   The findings of the new study, the researchers said, should be
viewed as preliminary, because the sample size was so small and
because the researchers knew that the women were taking sildenafil,
which might have influenced the results. A larger, more tightly
controlled study must be done before the findings can be viewed as
solid.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Goldstein said, ``In a new field, we need studies like
this that point us in the right direction. Then we can go ahead
with larger, more rigorous studies.''

EXPERTS STUDYING WHY `KILLER BEES' HAVE NOT ADVANCED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By TERRY KLIEWER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It's the story still waiting to be written, the
headline yet to be set in type: KILLER BEES INVADE HOUSTON.
</P>
<P>
   But you won't read it here, not today, anyway. That's because
the bees in question are nowhere to be found near Houston, the
fourth-largest city in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons still unclear to scientists, the Africanized
honeybees we've come to know and fear as ``killer bees'' have
stopped their march across southeast Texas.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-1994, bee experts were baffled that the aggressive
insects, which first crossed the Texas-Mexico border four years
earlier, had halted their eastward march about 50 miles west of
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The experts still aren't sure what's going on. Although the bees
continue to turn up in new areas north of us, they remain no-shows
around here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The news, I suppose, is there's no news,'' says Paul Jackson,
chief apiary inspector for Texas. ``There's very little change in
things'' since the first wave of publicity earlier in the decade.
</P>
<P>
   From his headquarters at Texas A&AMP;M University in College
Station, Jackson has a front-row seat for the bee invasion, if it
comes.
</P>
<P>
   Brazos County, home of the Texas A&AMP;M campus, is not listed as
killer bee turf, which means no such bees have been collected
there. They have been found to the south in Washington County and
to the west in Milam County.
</P>
<P>
   That puts Brazos County on the same bee bubble as Harris County,
which includes most of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when it comes to Africanized honeybee migration
patterns, such things as county lines, river routes, and mountain
ranges and deserts don't account for much.
</P>
<P>
   The intrepid bees have crossed them all since they first got
loose in Brazil more than 40 years ago in an experiment gone awry.
Since then, they've been on a Genghis Khan-like sweep north through
South America and now into the southwestern portion of North
America.
</P>
<P>
   Prolific and hardy, they've muscled their way over, under,
around and through more docile, indigenous bees and now are waiting
somewhere along Interstate 10, an ominous buzz in our western
skies.
</P>
<P>
   Should we worry? Not really, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The migration is inevitable. Kim Kaplan of the Agricultural
Research Service, an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
says nothing can or should be done to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything you do to kill Africanized honeybees is going to kill
the European variety, too,'' she says. ``Killing bees is not a good
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the USDA has no firm answers as to why the bees
have stopped their invasion of the South at Houston's doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not going to stop their migration,'' Kaplan
explains, ``then there's no point to researching why they're moving
or not.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kaplan, like Jackson, has theories. She begins with varroa
mites, which she says have taken a huge toll on European and
African honeybees in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny parasites kill bees and other susceptible insects by
boring into their bodies and draining them of liquids _ bug blood,
as it were.
</P>
<P>
   If mites mean fewer bees, then there's less pressure on the
colonies to strike out in search of new sources of water and
flowering vegetation, says Kaplan.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson thinks the migrating Africanized bees may have run into
double trouble when they pushed out of South Texas _ roughly the
part of the state south of a line from about Victoria to Del Rio.
</P>
<P>
   First, there were the mites, which the invaders didn't have to
contend with significantly until they reached the Corpus Christi
area, Jackson says. Second, there were agricultural pesticides,
starting in the Rio Grande Valley orchards and vegetable fields,
and extending northward into the rice fields and cornfields of the
Gulf Plains.
</P>
<P>
   By holding bee populations down, the poisons effectively induced
otherwise migratory colonies to linger longer in a given area.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a rule, the farther you move east, the more woods (as
opposed to fields) there will be and, in them, there will be more
mites and feral (native) bees that already have hives,'' says
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Mother Nature doesn't necessarily have a welcome
mat out for the migrating bees in East Texas or anywhere farther
eastward in the Deep South, despite its beckoning subtropical
climate.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana, where the bees once were forecast to arrive by
1992, officials are still keeping watch. Jackson says Texas
continues to check its traps in East Texas for signs of
Louisiana-bound Africanized bees. Traps in Texas run on an
east-west line from about Beaumont to Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Phillips, a public information and education specialist
with the Texas Apiary Inspection Service, says the notion that the
bees are in one place, but not in another, can be a little
misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are counties in Texas where they are not, that are all
but encircled by counties where they are,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   It's reasonable to suppose that the bees in such situations
wander across county lines occasionally. ``We just haven't run into
them yet, so they are not `there' yet,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   There are two reasons such determinations matter.
</P>
<P>
   The first is commercial. Beekeepers want to know the whereabouts
of Africanized bees so they can protect their own hives of European
bees, or at least be prepared if they get an influx of the African
variety.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the European type is more docile and produces much
more honey than its African counterpart, although Jackson says some
interbred bees perform pretty well as honey producers.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas track-and-trap effort is part of a quarantine system
administered by Jackon's office to better serve the honey industry.
When Africanized honeybees show up in a county, it is quarantined
by the apiary service until further notice.
</P>
<P>
   The designation means local beekeepers can move their hives
within the county but not elsewhere, without state certification.
This curtails inadvertent shipment of Africanized bee queens to
non-Africanized areas. Of course, bees in the wild still come and
go as they please.
</P>
<P>
   Texas now has 113 of its 254 counties quarantined, Phillips
reports. The most recent additions, Bosque, Hill and Somervell
counties in central Texas, went behind the Killer Bee Curtain in
June.
</P>
<P>
   The second reason to track bees is that the quarantine notices
serve as public-safety alerts.
</P>
<P>
   Although Africanized bees generally don't live up to their
menacing ``killer'' nickname, they have been responsible for human
and animal deaths. Like black widow or brown recluse spiders, they
can be a hazard and ought to be treated with great caution, says
Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   By now, it's pretty well-known that the bees aren't more
poisonous than ordinary bees, but they are more aggressive and
potentially more lethal. If the bees have a strategy for dealing
with provocation, it is: Hit quick. Hit hard. Keep hitting.
</P>
<P>
   The mere presence of a person or animal within 20 or 30 feet of
a killer beehive can be enough to touch off a black-and-yellow
blizzard of angry bees. They're willing to die by the hundreds in
an out-of-proportion stinging attack, and they're happy to chase
their prey as far as a half-mile.
</P>
<P>
   Experts advise people who are attacked to run and keep running
to escape, try to get indoors or into heavy brush where the bees
cannot follow, and seek first aid quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But the odds of encountering killer bees probably are not too
different from the odds of encountering a rattlesnake. Much depends
on where you are, what you're doing and what season it is, the
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Bend County demonstrates just how varied the killer bee
infiltrations and encounters can be.
</P>
<P>
   As the only southeast Texas county east of the Brazos River
where the bees have been trapped, Fort Bend has been under
quarantine since 1993 _ a likely place, one would assume, to bump
into the nasty bees. Jackson says stinging incidents usually peak
within two years of the bees' appearance in a locale.
</P>
<P>
   But only one Africanized honeybee attack has been documented
there _ at a vegetable stand in Rosenberg in 1996. That's one
encounter in six years. The obvious question looms: Are the bees
still in Fort Bend?
</P>
<P>
   The answer: maybe, which is pretty much the picture in Harris
County, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll probably not be able to prove the bees aren't in Harris
County, which is like trying to prove a negative in an argument,''
says Phillips, whose duties include documentation of stinging
incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if they're there, we'd hear about them. So far, we haven't
heard anything.''

WHO'S AFRAID OF THOSE BIG, BAD DOOMSDAY WARNINGS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid the summer news doldrums, what could be more invigorating
than a warning that physicists may be on the verge of destroying
the world?
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, this and similar alarms can be taken with a large grain
of salt, and viewed in the proper light, disaster warnings can be
fun. The idea that human beings could actually obliterate their
planet may be scary, but like a roller-coaster ride, it is
thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the face of doomsday speculation, most reasonable people
are pretty sure that the global roller coaster will stay on the
track despite the hair-raising ride.
</P>
<P>
   Disaster forecasts have a peculiar appeal, particularly if human
beings are the potential agents of destruction. Many of us may even
feel a perverse sense of empowerment when told that the human race,
ineffectual though it is in solving its biggest problems, might at
least be capable of wiping itself out.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, here is the latest bad, albeit entertaining, news for
disaster fans:
</P>
<P>
   Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, N.Y., has just
finished a huge accelerator capable of smashing together the nuclei
of very heavy atoms at nearly the speed of light. Builders of this
machine hope that collisions of gold or other atoms will not only
shatter the atoms' nuclei into their constituent protons and
neutrons, but will pulverize the protons and neutrons themselves,
leaving a ``plasma'' _ a kind of energy soup _ briefly consisting
of loose quark and gluon particles. These building blocks of matter
have never before been studied in such a state.
</P>
<P>
   But no one is quite sure what these collisions might spawn, and
the uncertainty has encouraged some people to speculate that
Brookhaven's new accelerator might turn out to be a doomsday
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, The Sunday Times of London informed readers that
Brookhaven might have created a world-devouring monster. The
British weekly commented that ``the men in white coats would send
us, and them, into the oblivion of a black hole of their making.''
(In reality, accelerator physicists wear jeans and sport shirts,
but never mind.)
</P>
<P>
   In one version of the supposed danger, a gold-to-gold collision
might create ``strange'' quarks that would pair up as
``strangelets.'' These supposedly might go on to annihilate the
ordinary matter around them, ending the world as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea mentioned by The Sunday Times and in letters from
readers published in the July issue of Scientific American is that
the high energy density of a gold-to-gold collision might nucleate
a tiny black hole that would grow like a cancer, eventually
devouring the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream physicists have cast cold water on such fears, but
every time a new accelerator begins operating, dire warnings have
ensued.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, when Fermilab's mighty Tevatron accelerator was
under construction in Illinois, alarms were heard that when protons
and antiprotons collided at a combined energy of two trillion
electron volts, the result might be a microscopic tear in the
fabric of space-time that extends throughout the universe _ a tear
that could bring on the ultimate Armageddon.
</P>
<P>
   There had been speculation by Dr. Frank Wilczek of the Institute
for Advanced Study and other physicists that the birth of the
universe might have left it with a false floor _ one that we
consider the absolute absence of energy: a kind of zero point.
</P>
<P>
   But energy scales are relative; the zero point on one scale may
not be zero on another. So some physicists wondered whether there
might be a hidden floor with an energy even lower than that of the
zero point familiar to us, and if so, what would happen if a hole
should open in the false floor.
</P>
<P>
   One idea was that a tear in space-time, perhaps caused by one of
the Tevatron's proton collisions, might bring on the collapse of
the false vacuum, annihilating all matter in the path of its
collapse. The collapse bubble would balloon outward at the speed of
light, eventually destroying the universe.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with this ingenious idea, physicists soon realized,
was that if such a catastrophe could occur it would have happened
long ago. The earth is constantly peppered by cosmic-ray particles,
some of which have energies 100 million times greater than the
energies of particles accelerated by the Tevatron or any other
machine, and yet the universal vacuum floor is intact and we, the
earth and the universe are still here. The Tevatron itself has been
producing rich discoveries for years, without endangering anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Physics has provided more than its share of doomsday scenarios,
real and imaginary.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, for instance, some scientists theorized that a
nuclear war would be followed by a deadly ``nuclear winter.''
Fortunately, we have never tested that prediction.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear weaponry from its inception has inspired horrifying
speculation. Before the first nuclear explosion, the Trinity test
in New Mexico on July 16, 1945, there were suggestions that a
nuclear explosion might ignite the earth's atmosphere, destroying
all life.
</P>
<P>
   The great Enrico Fermi was inspired to do some calculating just
before the Trinity test and concluded that the atmosphere was in no
real danger.
</P>
<P>
   After the blast, J. Robert Oppenheimer, leader of the Los Alamos
bomb team, uttered one of the most often repeated _ and some would
say, pretentious _ reactions of the day. Quoting the Hindu god
Shiva, he said, ``Now I am become death, destroyer of worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   Doomsday speculation has also been sparked by chemists.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, an obscure Soviet chemist named Nikolai
Fedyakin reported that water in thin glass tubes seemed to be
transforming itself into a peculiar viscous form. A famous physical
chemist, Boris V. Deryagin, announced that his own experiments
confirmed Fedyakin's discovery of ``anomalous water,'' and dozens
of scientists in Europe and the United States chimed in with
additional confirmations.
</P>
<P>
   The stuff was dubbed ``polywater''_ ordinary water molecules
chained together as a polymer _ and some scientists speculated that
it might convert all the world's water to an unusable polymerized
form, thereby killing off most life. It sounded all too similar to
an imaginary high-temperature ice, ``Ice-9,'' a fictional invention
of the novelist Kurt Vonnegut, who imagined the world being
destroyed by the elimination of all liquid water.
</P>
<P>
   It took four years to dispel the polywater myth: scientists
finally determined that polywater was nothing more than dirty
water.
</P>
<P>
   But in place of the polywater menace we have seen a spate of
warnings about asteroid impacts, gene-splicing mishaps that could
turn the human race into centaurs, super earthquakes, and much
more.
</P>
<P>
   It is worth remembering that there are plenty of serious threats
to the planet resulting from human bungling, of course.
</P>
<P>
   There is the thinning ozone layer, a victim of
chlorofluorocarbons released from refrigerators and other sources
over the years. Large Third World nations still manufacture
chlorofluorocarbons, despite a ban on their manufacture and use in
industrial nations.
</P>
<P>
   Growing evidence shows that human use of carbon-based fuels is
contributing to global warming.
</P>
<P>
   The habitats that nourish pandas, penguins, parrots and
thousands of other animals and plants are disappearing because of
human activity, and the diversity of life on earth faces disastrous
impoverishment.
</P>
<P>
   So the trick will be sorting out the red herrings like
accelerator disasters and polywater from the real dangers. While
we're at it, we might quit basing self-esteem on the ability of the
human race to commit collective suicide.

 &HT;    HIGH-TECH TRADITIONALISTS STAMPEDE INTO HUNT COUNTRY
 &HT;    1130&AMP;add. Moving in (a) national and (l) lifestyle categories
for release Sunday, Aug. 15.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLEBURG, Va. _ The license plate on the Lexus said it all:
``POLO MOM.''
</P>
<P>
   The scents of money and manure have long mingled in Hunt
Country, the historic name of this piedmont in the shadow of the
Blue Ridge Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Stables are as common as garages, and blacksmiths are as vital
as baby-sitters for young families. Polo is actually a
johnny-come-lately pastime in a rolling green region where, for
several centuries, the major sporting seasons have been fox hunting
in the fall and steeplechases in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``A horse is absolutely a necessity'' for Hunt Country living,
said Kim Mendes, whose family has two and is shopping for a third.
</P>
<P>
   With a new house and a newer barn on five acres of former
farmland along a gravel road, the Mendes family is part of a
population boom that is changing the region's culture and
demographics while clinging to its horsey heritage. With two
children, they added the barn shortly after moving down from New
York and discovering that they had the room and the hankering for
horses.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mendes, a telecommunications company executive, is typical
of Hunt Country newcomers. He commutes 35 minutes to work in the
high-tech corridor near Dulles International Airport where America
Online, Orbital Sciences, Comsat, Star Technologies and dozens of
other digital industries are headquartered in a suburb of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Loudoun County, home to both the stables of Middleburg and the
servers of AOL, is one of the fastest growing areas in America. In
what was mostly a rural economy two decades ago, 75 percent of
county's new employers are in high-tech fields. Unemployment is
practically nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Land values are soaring in the rural areas an hour's drive from
the nation's capital. Sandy Lerner, co-founder of Cisco Systems
Software, paid about $7 million for the 800-acre Ayrshire estate in
Loudoun County. Robert Johnson, chairman of Black Entertainment
Television, bought a sprawling Hunt Country farm for about $4.3
million. ``Farmettes'' with a house and a stable on five- to
10-acre lots start at around $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech influx is fueling a boom in low-tech trades that
have survived in Hunt Country since colonial times.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tech money is keeping us all very busy,'' said Malcolm
Matheson, a stone mason who said he can't keep up with the demand
for pillars, chimneys, archways and patios. ``In two months, I've
had to turn down probably a quarter of a million dollars worth of
work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got more than I can handle,'' said Art Bennett, a
blacksmith who has shoed horses for 30 years. ``This is the best
business I've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone welcomes the changes.
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers move out ``for all the right reasons _ desire for
a country life and dreams of owning a horse. The problem is that
there's only so much room,'' said Dennis Foster, executive director
of the Masters of the Foxhound Association, which oversees all
mounted fox hunting in North America. ``The same people coming out
for the lifestyle may be finding that the lifestyle is not here any
more.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   In local lore, at least, the equine lifestyle harkens back to
the English gentry who colonized Virginia. An early aristocracy
established large estates _ 1,000 or so acres of cornfields and
pastures crossed by bubbling streams called ``runs'' and bounded by
trim hedgerows and miles of winding stone fences.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, hounds still chase native foxes across this
countryside, spiritedly pursued by horse-borne men and women in red
riding jackets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fox hunting heaven for the United States,'' said
Joseph Neusch, the Master of the Fairfax Hunt. ``Some of these
high-tech, nouveau riche people see those wonderful old prints ...
that show hunters socializing in the field and they say, 'I want to
do that.' ``
</P>
<P>
   And Neusch _ who trains both riders and horses at Paper Chase
Farms _ is happy to oblige the aspirants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes about a year with the right trainer and the right
horse,'' he said. ``They get so hooked that they can't talk about
anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The 110-acre farm is located a few miles outside of Middleburg,
beside the John S. Mosby Highway _ named for Confederacy's
legendary ``Gray Ghost'' who led calvary raids nearby during the
Civil War. It is owned by Neusch and his wife, Jan Neuharth, a
former Los Angeles lawyer and the daughter of USA Today founder Al
Neuharth.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Starcher, the stable manager, is also an avid fox hunter.
</P>
<P>
   The sport is often misunderstood, he said. For instance,
``dropping the fox'' _ setting loose a fox to chase _ ``is
absolutely not done.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a wild, local fox is sniffed out by the hounds, who
have bad eyesight and ``run by scent,'' Starcher explained. The
chase usually lasts from five to 20 minutes and the fox almost
always gets away _ crossing a hard road or running through a herd
of cows or flock of sheep or otherwise maneuvering so the hounds
lose the scent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to catch the fox,'' he said. ``Without foxes, we
don't have a hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Spring is for steeplechases _ cross-country horse races whose
name dates back to England, where riders would gallop toward church
steeples peeking over distant hills. The courses are carefully
mapped nowadays, but racers must still jump their horses over
fences and hedgerows and across brooks.
</P>
<P>
   For both events, socializing and tradition are nearly as
important as riding. Wearing tweed in the fall and seersucker in
the spring, onlookers and participants eat and drink at lavish
tailgate parties and discuss the bloodlines of horses, hounds and
humans in their exclusive subculture.
</P>
<P>
   Fox hunts and steeplechases both require expanses of fields,
meadows and woodlands for the riders to gallop tally-ho across. And
therein lies the concern of some traditionalists, who regard
10-acre lots as high density housing.
</P>
<P>
   Dividing large estates into ``farmettes'' threatens the sports,
said Foster. As head of the national Masters of the Foxhound
Association, he said his main concern has become urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   A farmer who has welcomed 30 fox hunters onto his land for years
has second thoughts when the group increases to 150 riders, Foster
said.
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers ``love horses,'' so ``obviously, these are the
kinds of people you like to see here,'' he said. ``But it's getting
to the point that there are more hunters than ground to hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditional fox hunts and steeplechases are increasingly being
augmented by equine sports that require less space _ polo, dressage
and even western rodeo events, said Peter Winants, a veteran fox
hunter and director of the National Sporting Library in Middleburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a boom in all the horse sports,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   In Middleburg, a village of 800 residents, the importance of the
horse is impossible to miss. Townswomen get their hair styled at
``The Pony Tail'' and buy dresses at ``The Finicky Filly.'' A local
photographer displays 35-year-old prints of Jackie Kennedy in
riding togs with her toddler son, John-John.
</P>
<P>
   Middleburg is home of the ``Chronicle of the Horse,'' a national
magazine whose average subscriber has an annual income of $168,000.
Publisher Robert Banner said the many of the region's newcomers are
enthusiastic equestrians who are infusing new spirit into the
sporting scene and new money into the local economy.

<P>
   The Hunt Country lifestyle can be costly. Most area horses cost
from $5,000 to $25,000, with top show ring performers going for as
much as $100,000, said Starcher, the Paper Chase Farms stable
manager. Upkeep can be expensive as well. For instance, he said, it
costs from $100 to $300 to shoe a horse, and they have to be reshod
every five weeks or so.
</P>
<P>
   But the computer industries have created considerable wealth,
said Matheson, the stone mason. ``My clients are from 24 years old
to their 40s and work in a high-tech field. They're changing the
place for the better. They're nice people. Easy to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Blacksmith Art Bennett likewise welcomes the brisk business from
the new resident equestrians.
</P>
<P>
   The income ``trickles right on down,'' he said. ``When I was a
boy, my father took me to a horse race and pointed to the barn and
said, 'That's the only place you'll ever make money at a
racetrack.' And he was absolutely right.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kim Mendes said her family loves living in Hunt
Country and is thinking about buying a bigger spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband is getting very wrapped up in this horse
business,'' she said. ``We thought bringing our children up in the
country would be a better way of life. It seems to work for us.''

 &HT;    HIGH-TECH TRADITIONALISTS STAMPEDE INTO HUNT COUNTRY
 &HT;    1130&AMP;add. Moving in (a) national and (l) lifestyle categories
for release Sunday, Aug. 15.
 &HT;    By BOB DART

<P>
   MIDDLEBURG, Va. _ The license plate on the Lexus said it all:
``POLO MOM.''
</P>
<P>
   The scents of money and manure have long mingled in Hunt
Country, the historic name of this piedmont in the shadow of the
Blue Ridge Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Stables are as common as garages, and blacksmiths are as vital
as baby-sitters for young families. Polo is actually a
johnny-come-lately pastime in a rolling green region where, for
several centuries, the major sporting seasons have been fox hunting
in the fall and steeplechases in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``A horse is absolutely a necessity'' for Hunt Country living,
said Kim Mendes, whose family has two and is shopping for a third.
</P>
<P>
   With a new house and a newer barn on five acres of former
farmland along a gravel road, the Mendes family is part of a
population boom that is changing the region's culture and
demographics while clinging to its horsey heritage. With two
children, they added the barn shortly after moving down from New
York and discovering that they had the room and the hankering for
horses.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mendes, a telecommunications company executive, is typical
of Hunt Country newcomers. He commutes 35 minutes to work in the
high-tech corridor near Dulles International Airport where America
Online, Orbital Sciences, Comsat, Star Technologies and dozens of
other digital industries are headquartered in a suburb of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Loudoun County, home to both the stables of Middleburg and the
servers of AOL, is one of the fastest growing areas in America. In
what was mostly a rural economy two decades ago, 75 percent of
county's new employers are in high-tech fields. Unemployment is
practically nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Land values are soaring in the rural areas an hour's drive from
the nation's capital. Sandy Lerner, co-founder of Cisco Systems
Software, paid about $7 million for the 800-acre Ayrshire estate in
Loudoun County. Robert Johnson, chairman of Black Entertainment
Television, bought a sprawling Hunt Country farm for about $4.3
million. ``Farmettes'' with a house and a stable on five- to
10-acre lots start at around $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech influx is fueling a boom in low-tech trades that
have survived in Hunt Country since colonial times.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tech money is keeping us all very busy,'' said Malcolm
Matheson, a stone mason who said he can't keep up with the demand
for pillars, chimneys, archways and patios. ``In two months, I've
had to turn down probably a quarter of a million dollars worth of
work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got more than I can handle,'' said Art Bennett, a
blacksmith who has shoed horses for 30 years. ``This is the best
business I've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone welcomes the changes.
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers move out ``for all the right reasons _ desire for
a country life and dreams of owning a horse. The problem is that
there's only so much room,'' said Dennis Foster, executive director
of the Masters of the Foxhound Association, which oversees all
mounted fox hunting in North America. ``The same people coming out
for the lifestyle may be finding that the lifestyle is not here any
more.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   In local lore, at least, the equine lifestyle harkens back to
the English gentry who colonized Virginia. An early aristocracy
established large estates _ 1,000 or so acres of cornfields and
pastures crossed by bubbling streams called ``runs'' and bounded by
trim hedgerows and miles of winding stone fences.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, hounds still chase native foxes across this
countryside, spiritedly pursued by horse-borne men and women in red
riding jackets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fox hunting heaven for the United States,'' said
Joseph Neusch, the Master of the Fairfax Hunt. ``Some of these
high-tech, nouveau riche people see those wonderful old prints ...
that show hunters socializing in the field and they say, 'I want to
do that.' ``
</P>
<P>
   And Neusch _ who trains both riders and horses at Paper Chase
Farms _ is happy to oblige the aspirants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes about a year with the right trainer and the right
horse,'' he said. ``They get so hooked that they can't talk about
anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The 110-acre farm is located a few miles outside of Middleburg,
beside the John S. Mosby Highway _ named for Confederacy's
legendary ``Gray Ghost'' who led calvary raids nearby during the
Civil War. It is owned by Neusch and his wife, Jan Neuharth, a
former Los Angeles lawyer and the daughter of USA Today founder Al
Neuharth.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Starcher, the stable manager, is also an avid fox hunter.
</P>
<P>
   The sport is often misunderstood, he said. For instance,
``dropping the fox'' _ setting loose a fox to chase _ ``is
absolutely not done.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a wild, local fox is sniffed out by the hounds, who
have bad eyesight and ``run by scent,'' Starcher explained. The
chase usually lasts from five to 20 minutes and the fox almost
always gets away _ crossing a hard road or running through a herd
of cows or flock of sheep or otherwise maneuvering so the hounds
lose the scent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to catch the fox,'' he said. ``Without foxes, we
don't have a hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Spring is for steeplechases _ cross-country horse races whose
name dates back to England, where riders would gallop toward church
steeples peeking over distant hills. The courses are carefully
mapped nowadays, but racers must still jump their horses over
fences and hedgerows and across brooks.
</P>
<P>
   For both events, socializing and tradition are nearly as
important as riding. Wearing tweed in the fall and seersucker in
the spring, onlookers and participants eat and drink at lavish
tailgate parties and discuss the bloodlines of horses, hounds and
humans in their exclusive subculture.
</P>
<P>
   Fox hunts and steeplechases both require expanses of fields,
meadows and woodlands for the riders to gallop tally-ho across. And
therein lies the concern of some traditionalists, who regard
10-acre lots as high density housing.
</P>
<P>
   Dividing large estates into ``farmettes'' threatens the sports,
said Foster. As head of the national Masters of the Foxhound
Association, he said his main concern has become urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   A farmer who has welcomed 30 fox hunters onto his land for years
has second thoughts when the group increases to 150 riders, Foster
said.
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers ``love horses,'' so ``obviously, these are the
kinds of people you like to see here,'' he said. ``But it's getting
to the point that there are more hunters than ground to hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditional fox hunts and steeplechases are increasingly being
augmented by equine sports that require less space _ polo, dressage
and even western rodeo events, said Peter Winants, a veteran fox
hunter and director of the National Sporting Library in Middleburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a boom in all the horse sports,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   In Middleburg, a village of 800 residents, the importance of the
horse is impossible to miss. Townswomen get their hair styled at
``The Pony Tail'' and buy dresses at ``The Finicky Filly.'' A local
photographer displays 35-year-old prints of Jackie Kennedy in
riding togs with her toddler son, John-John.
</P>
<P>
   Middleburg is home of the ``Chronicle of the Horse,'' a national
magazine whose average subscriber has an annual income of $168,000.
Publisher Robert Banner said the many of the region's newcomers are
enthusiastic equestrians who are infusing new spirit into the
sporting scene and new money into the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Hunt Country lifestyle can be costly. Most area horses cost
from $5,000 to $25,000, with top show ring performers going for as
much as $100,000, said Starcher, the Paper Chase Farms stable

costs from $100 to $300 to shoe a horse, and they have to be reshod
every five weeks or so.

STAKES HIGH IN IOWA POLL FOR BUSH, OTHER HOPEFULS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While most Americans endure the dog days of summer,
the Republican presidential candidates will be diving into their
first key presidential contest Saturday in Ames, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The straw poll, a fund-raiser for the state's Republican Party,
has historically played only a marginal role in determining who
wins the Iowa caucuses or becomes the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   But the event has gained more prominence this year because of
the participation of Republican presidential front-runner George W.
Bush, who boasts that he intends to win.
</P>
<P>
   The straw poll will help gauge the strength of Bush's
organization and those of his rivals as well as the depth of his
appeal in this key primary caucus state.
</P>
<P>
   If he does not do as well as expected, the governor is sure to
hear criticism that his campaign is more hype than substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be the first chink in the armor of George W. Bush,''
said Hugh Winebrenner, a professor of public administration at
Drake University in Des Moines who has chronicled the history of
the Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are even higher for the other eight participating GOP
candidates, who need to do well to persuade potential backers to
bankroll their struggling efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The results could also set up the stand-in for front-runner
status if Bush stumbles. Many of the candidates are striving to be
at least in the top half, if not the top three.
</P>
<P>
   ``They desperately need some good news to buck up their
supporters to continue to fund-raise,'' said Winebrenner, adding
that a strong showing by Bush could ``be one more nail in the
coffins of several campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, who has devoted almost
all his time in Iowa but still lags in fund raising and in polls,
has said he needs to perform well in Ames.
</P>
<P>
   But others are taking the event more lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a do-or-die or a make-or-break for us,'' said
Monte Shaw, the Iowa campaign coordinator for Elizabeth Dole, who
has been drawing large crowds in the state as she trails in polling
and money.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said he viewed the event as ``a way to ramp up our
organization a little early.''
</P>
<P>
   State Republican officials estimate that as many as 15,000
people will attend the event at the Hilton Coliseum on the Iowa
State University campus.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the forum has not only drawn national media
attention but has become a financial bonanza for the state
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP charges $25 for a ticket that enables one to participate
in the straw poll and hear the candidates' 10-minute speeches. The
campaigns generally defray the ticket cost for supporters, as well
as provide transportation to Ames.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the
candidates appear to be taking the straw poll seriously. McCain,
who has opposed the ethanol tax subsidy dear to many rural Iowans,
has said he will not participate and has instead been spending time
in other primary states, particularly South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great fund-raiser for the Iowa Republican Party. I
congratulate them for the scam,'' McCain told cable television's
MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other candidates, however, have been barnstorming
across Iowa, hitting town hall meetings, VFW posts and centers for
senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush's bank account and endorsement lists dwarf those of
his rivals, he has spent far less time than his competitors in a
state that has traditionally demanded personal attention from
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   As of last week, the Texas governor has campaigned in the state
only six days, including a recent two-day visit. By comparison,
Alexander has logged more than 70 days and magazine mogul Steve
Forbes has devoted almost 50 days.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Bush campaign is going all-out to win the
straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has brought in volunteers from Texas to help locate
potential straw poll participants.
</P>
<P>
   And to ensure its supporters make it to Ames, the Bush campaign
has rented 99 buses to transport supporters from across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Once at the event, Bush backers will be feted at a tent party
that includes a barbecue spread and a host of entertainers and
sports celebrities, including country singer Tracy Byrd, world
champion bass fisher Johnny Morris and San Antonio Spurs basketball
player Sean Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to stage the party in a prime location, the Bush campaign
shelled out more than anybody else at a silent auction, $43,000 for
a 60,000-square-foot plot across from the coliseum. The
next-highest bidder, Forbes, paid $8,000 for an adjacent
40,000-square-foot plot.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander has run TV ads that spoof the land deal and feature an
auctioneer trying to sell the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Eric Woolson defended the expenditures: ``You
have to do things to make it easy for people to attend.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has also been attacked for relying on powerful
allies outside of Iowa to help win the poll. According to a memo
that surfaced earlier this year, the campaign planned to use
Washington-based trade associations to prod Iowa affiliates to
persuade 700 people to show up at the straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   Woolson would not confirm that the Washington lobbying effort
was paying off. But he said: ``Are we encouraging specific groups
to turn out for the governor? Yes we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Iowa observers believe that Forbes, a multimillionaire who
has been willing to tap into his fortune to build up his campaign,
may be Bush's most formidable rival in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' officials were reluctant to divulge details of their
battle plan, however. When asked how many buses had been leased to
bring in backers, a campaign official replied: ``That's a state
secret.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign has also been accused of using questionable
tactics to increase turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the director of the state Christian Coalition told the
Des Moines Register that a Forbes campaign representative
approached a temporary employment agency she runs last February and
inquired about hiring workers to bolster his tally in the straw
poll.
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign denied the allegation. The national office
of the Christian Coalition also disputed the charges leveled by
state director Bobbie Gobel and later fired her.
</P>
<P>
   State Republican officials note that the party cracked down on
controversial practices in the past, including the busing in of
out-of-state residents. Before voting this year, all participants
must show photo identification that establishes them as Iowans.
</P>
<P>
   Some have questioned the long-term impact of a function that
draws only a fraction of the people who generally turn out for the
early winter caucuses. Furthermore, Iowa, which is overwhelmingly
white and rural, is hardly representative of the increasingly
diverse U.S. electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is all pretty stupid,'' said John Haskell, a professor of
political science at Drake University. Nevertheless, Haskell said
the perception has grown that these events matter, particularly
with an increasingly front-loaded primary season that forces
candidates to raise money earlier than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Dee Stewart, the state GOP's executive director, defended the
straw poll's significance, arguing that it measures the current
health of the campaigns, particularly in terms of money and
grass-roots organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only real midterm exam that the candidates have,''
said Stewart, who also said the straw poll does give an early
indication of who the nominee will be. He noted that over the last
20 years, the party's nominee had come from one of the top three in
Ames.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the outcomes of the straw polls have both been
prescient and misleading. In 1995, Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas tied
with front-running Sen. Bob Dole in the straw poll, leading some
analysts to predict that Dole was losing steam. However, by the
time the voting in the Iowa caucus was done, Gramm's campaign had
fizzled. Dole won the caucus and the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, George Bush defied conventional wisdom by beating
Ronald Reagan in the straw poll. Bush went on to win the Iowa
caucuses, but Reagan later rebounded and won the nomination and the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, the straw poll turned into a liability for
Bush, when he suffered a devastating loss to Pat Robertson and
Dole. Bush also lost the Iowa caucuses, but won the nomination and
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's strong showing also signaled the growing clout of
the religious conservatives within the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the straw poll this year may indicate the
diminishing clout of social conservatives, as many of them appeared
to be splintered among Forbes, Dan Quayle, Gary Bauer, Pat Buchanan
and Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   While Buchanan did well last time in both the caucuses and the
straw poll, his third try for the White House does not appear to be
electrifying supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle also has been struggling to raise money and does not
appear to have a strong state organization.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, who has spent considerable time in the state, appears to
be making the most headway.
</P>
<P>
   The former head of the conservative Family Research Council has
lambasted Bush for abandoning Republican principles on such issues
as abortion and human rights in China.
</P>
<P>
   Marlys Popma, Bauer's deputy political director, said she
believed voters might retaliate against the Texas governor as the
perception grows that he has been anointed by the party elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has spent more time at fund-raisers (in the country's power
centers) than he has in Iowa,'' Popma said.
</P>
<P>
   Woolson dismissed the attacks on Bush as coming from campaigns
``that don't have resources.''

WHEN BAD THINGS HAPPEN IN THE HOSPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SANDEEP JAUHAR, M.D.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One recent Saturday morning, on rounds in the intensive care
unit at the hospital where I am a resident, a senior staff
physician and I stopped to examine a 72-year-old woman.
</P>
<P>
   She had walked into the emergency room two weeks earlier, short
of breath, I told him. She was carrying a report from another
hospital stating that she had fluid in the sac around her heart.
Why the fluid had collected was unclear. She was an active woman
who played with her grandchildren and regularly attended church.
</P>
<P>
   While lying on a stretcher in the ER, she had briefly stopped
breathing, again for reasons that were unclear. Physicians in the
emergency room had inserted a breathing tube in her windpipe and
transferred her to the ICU.
</P>
<P>
   There, things rapidly fell apart. A needle, inserted in an
effort to drain the fluid around her heart and examine it for clues
to her underlying disease, was inadvertently pushed too far,
piercing her heart. She lost several liters of blood. Because she
was a Jehovah's Witness, she refused to accept blood transfusions.
</P>
<P>
   Debilitated and anemic, she became dependent on her ventilator.
But she found the breathing tube painful and uncomfortable, and she
periodically tried to yank it out, which raised her blood pressure
to dangerous levels.
</P>
<P>
   One morning, I walked into her room to find her unable to move
the right side of her body. A CAT scan confirmed that she had
suffered a large stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Now she was lying in bed, heavily sedated, her wrists
restrained, receiving sustenance through a tube.
</P>
<P>
   The attending physician looked at the woman sadly. She would
have been much better off, he said, if she had never come to the
ICU. ``Bad things happen here. You see it all the time. It's
probably a combination of patients already being sick and the
terrible things we do to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and medical treatments hurt patients all the time, and
not just in the ICU. As medicine becomes more technically complex
and patients live longer, hospital-acquired complications have
reached epidemic proportions.
</P>
<P>
   A 1991 study by Harvard researchers, for example, found that 3.7
percent of randomly selected patients in New York State hospitals
in 1984 suffered ``adverse events,'' the medical euphemism for when
things go wrong during their treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, 14 percent died. Almost 28 percent of the events were
linked to negligence. Drug complications were the most common type
of adverse event (19 percent), followed by wound infections (14
percent) and complications from technical procedures like inserting
catheters into the arteries or veins.
</P>
<P>
   Old age, severity of disease and complexity of treatment, all
commonplace in the ICU, increased the likelihood of bad events, the
researchers found.
</P>
<P>
   The actual number of patients injured by hospital treatment may
be even higher. Many experts believe the Harvard study grossly
underestimated the actual dangers to patients from iatrogenic or
doctor-caused injury.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, in a 1997 report in The Lancet, observers in a
large Chicago teaching hospital found that of 1,047 patients
followed over nine months, 17.7 percent suffered at least one
serious adverse event. Only 1.2 percent of the injured patients
sought compensation.
</P>
<P>
   And in a study appearing this year in The Archives of Internal
Medicine, 10.9 percent of admissions to a French ICU in 1994 were
related to doctor-caused disease, and about half resulted from some
form of negligence.
</P>
<P>
   ICU care, provided to the most frail and sick patients, often
results in the worst iatrogenic injuries. Catheters placed in
various organs and invasive procedures, like spinal and lung taps,
can cause complications like bleeding and infection.
</P>
<P>
   Frequent blood drawing and round-the-clock monitoring often
result in fatigue and depression among patients. Heavy use of
medicine sometimes results in drug reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our patients would do better on auto pilot,'' a doctor
completing a senior fellowship in the ICU at my hospital recently
told me. ``They'd be better off if we brought them in here and just
left them alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is an exaggeration. Many patients will do fine
if they can be supported through an acute medical crisis. But even
for these patients, the level of care that is safe and necessary
has not been clearly defined.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Dr. Arnold Relman, then editor of The New England
Journal of Medicine, wrote: ``The cost and psychological stress of
ICU treatment would be justifiable if such units were known to
reduce mortality and morbidity from levels achievable with less
costly and intensive modes of hospital care. (But) there have been
no prospective, randomized, controlled trials to supply such
data.'' Almost two decades later, such studies are still lacking.
</P>
<P>
   I remember taking care of an elderly woman in the ICU who was in
a coma for a month. She developed a blood infection, and kidney,
heart and respiratory failure, but lingered for weeks with
antibiotics and drugs to elevate her blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   We all knew she was going to die and that our efforts were
futile. Still, no one in her family was willing to give up, and so
we persisted in aggressively treating her, causing her obvious pain
every time we poked her with a new catheter or pushed on her belly
to examine her.
</P>
<P>
   What finally caused her death was a catheter placed through a
hole in her abdomen, which probably resulted in yet another
infection. She did not live any longer because of what we had done,
just ended her life more miserably.
</P>
<P>
   One day, I walked into the residents' work room and saw
scribbled in red ink on the eraser board: Primum non nocere. First
do no harm.
</P>
<P>
   More is not always better, especially in medicine. Less
aggressive treatment may sometimes reduce the risk of injury,
particularly in patients who have a good chance of getting well
again.
</P>
<P>
   Studies are beginning to prove that conservative management is
often the right course for many patients. For example, a study
reported recently in The New England Journal of Medicine found that
many anemic patients do better when they receive fewer blood
transfusions. Fewer transfusions mean fewer transfusion reactions,
infections and so on.
</P>
<P>
   And recent studies also show that pulmonary artery catheters,
used to measure blood pressure in the lungs and once a hallmark of
the ICU, provide little benefit to patients and may even increase
mortality, even for conditions for which they have been almost
uniformly accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Though it runs counter to most medical training, only when
doctors learn to do less, and not always more, will they stop
causing inadvertent harm to patients in the ICU.

<P>
   Fitness experts call them ``explosive'' or ``ballistic''
training exercises. And according to the American College of Sports
Medicine, which endorsed the lightweight, high-speed techniques in
a statement last month, they are a good way to increase strength.
</P>
<P>
   Movements advocated by the organization include faster versions
of traditional exercises, like squats and bench presses, and
plyometrics, a group of exercises that involve jumping on and off
high platforms, tossing around weighted balls and leaping in the
air while holding weights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Explosive movements are effective because they not only
increase strength but the speed with which you can call strength
into play,'' said Dr. Steven Fleck, chairman of the sports science
department at Colorado College, Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Fleck points out that in a traditional, nonballistic weight
training repetition, full muscle power is not required until about
a second after beginning. In contrast, during a ballistic
repetition, maximum power is needed much faster _ in two-tenths of
a second or less, the same speed as in athletic skills like
throwing a softball or sprinting down a soccer field. For this
reason, Fleck recommends explosive weight training as an essential
training tool for serious and recreational athletes alike.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, athletes have long practiced explosive weight training.
Pat Manocchia, owner of La Palestra, an exclusive gym located on
Manhattan's Upper West Side, has trained his clients using
plyometric and other high-speed training methods for more than five
years.
</P>
<P>
   He often includes in his clients' training programs ``depth
jumps,'' an exercise that involves hopping off a 12-to-24-inch high
box onto the floor, then springing back up again.
</P>
<P>
   Manocchia's clients, who range from professional football
players to seasoned marathoners, do as many as four, 90-second
depth jump sets during a workout. ``In any athletic movement, be it
a golf swing, jump shot, or tennis serve, your muscles must be able
to generate speed,'' Manocchia explained. ``This type of movement
helps develop these qualities so you perform better and get injured
less often.`
</P>
<P>
   Research seems to support Manocchia's assertions. In a study
published earlier this year in the journal Medicine and Science in
Sports and Exercise, 16 elite male volleyball players performed a
typical preseason training program that included cardiovascular
conditioning and moderately paced weight training. Half the
subjects also added plyometric jumps and other explosive movements
to their repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of eight weeks, the plyometric group demonstrated a 6
percent improvement in jumping ability; the control group showed
virtually no improvement. The researchers concluded that their
results lend support to the effectiveness of ballistic training.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Steven Plisk, director of sports conditioning for
Yale University in New Haven, Conn., also recommends explosive
training for older exercisers. According to Plisk, most everyday
activities have an explosive quality. ``If you step off a curb when
a car is coming, it's not how much weight you can move _ it's how
fast you can move it out of the way,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Plisk said that explosive movements can help older people
improve mobility because they usually involve several muscle groups
working simultaneously in conjunction with each other, much the
same as they do during everyday actions. ``Jumping moves, for
instance, require a coordinated effort of virtually every muscle in
your body. Besides building strength, they also promotes balance,
agility, and coordination, all of which help you to rise from a
chair, walk across the room, and perform countless other basic
activities easily and gracefully,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``However,'' Fleck cautioned, ``ballistic exercise is an
advanced technique and not something you should do if you're an
inexperienced weight trainer.''
</P>
<P>
   He recommends starting a program of six to 12 weeks consisting
of slower paced weight work to build a strength base, then
gradually incorporating ballistic movements. ``Perfect form and
technique are essential so it's a good idea to get some instruction
when you're first learning new explosive training moves,'' he
added.

RECORDS DETAIL VERMONT STERILIZATION PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Adds first name of Abenaki acting chief April Rushlow.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It changes the way you think of those paragons of New England
society, the Yankees, to learn that Vermont scientists had an
active program to breed them.
</P>
<P>
   But there it is, in the archives at the Public Records Office in
Burlington: the long-abandoned paperwork of the Vermont Eugenics
Survey, tracing in businesslike diagrams the ``degenerate''
bloodlines that social scientists in the 1920s and '30s hoped to
eliminate and the ``old pioneer stock'' they hoped to replenish.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen times, as she paged through the old records, Nancy
Gallagher thought about abandoning her project.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, no historian had ever written a book about
Vermont Eugenics Survey's 12-year study of ``good'' and ``bad''
families, which was widely circulated among policymakers and
culminated in a law providing for the sterilization of several
hundred poor, rural Vermonters, Abenaki Indians, and other people
deemed unfit to reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   The story of state-level eugenics was largely untold. Somewhere,
between Gregor Mendel's revolutionary work in genetics and the
Nazis' bizarre distortion of it, there was a void in the teaching
of history.
</P>
<P>
   But on the other hand, she knew there are people in the state
who would read their own family histories in her book.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher wasn't a bomb-throwing revisionist historian, she was
a 50-year-old former biology teacher who expected her doctoral
thesis to ``sit on a shelf,'' and she had stumbled into a subject
both unexplored and painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every step of the way,'' said Gallagher, ``I wondered if I
should even be writing it.''
</P>
<P>
   When her book, ``Breeding Better Vermonters: The Eugenics
Project in the Green Mountain State,'' is published by the
University Press of New England later this year, the wondering will
be over. Gallagher and the rest of the state will be left with the
emotional fallout of a historical episode that no one, not even its
victims, particularly wants to discuss. The Eugenics Project was an
obscure independent effort whose only real effect was the
sterilization law, but its archives reveal a mindset so abhorrent
that the historian who first discovered the papers walked away from
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a real dark streak in me, and it's very dark
material. You can try and not be affected by it, but there's a lot
of hate in it,'' said Kevin Dann, a historian in Woodstock who came
upon the crates of eugenics surveys almost accidentally in the
mid-1980s and published the first article about it in 1986. ``The
tales of redemption and human kindness and serendipity and grace
are not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermont's social scientists were hardly alone in embracing
eugenics, the science of human breeding that branched off from
social Darwinism. All over the United States during the first two
decades of this century, progressives were on fire to prevent, and
not just manage, the misery of the poor. New science seemed to
supply an answer: domestic abuse and alcoholism, long blamed on bad
social conditions, were thought to be caused by recessive genes and
inbreeding. By reducing the number of babies born to sick or unwed
parents, and by attracting desirable settlers, social scientists
thought they could a build a healthier society.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Vermont was the 31st state to pass a law allowing for
sterilization of the handicapped or ``feebleminded.'' The number of
sterilizations that took place in Vermont was a tiny fraction of
the 60,000 that took place in states before the laws were rolled
back in the 1960s and '70s, according to Diane Paul, a UMass-Boston
political scientist and author of the book ``Controlling Human
Heredity: 1865 to the Present.''
</P>
<P>
   But in some ways, Gallagher argues, Vermonters were uniquely
ready to accept eugenic solutions. The state's population was
dwindling and the draft board was rejecting an increasing number of
young men _ trends that dealt a blow to the closely-held Yankee
Protestant ideal. In 1930, 71 percent of the state's 350,000 people
were native Vermonters. This kind of population can be changed more
readily, encouraging eugenicists to ``improve the quality of its
native stock,'' as one put it. The global craze for bettering
society through selective breeding could be applied to local aims.
</P>
<P>
   It was in this atmosphere that the University of Vermont zoology
professor Henry Perkins threw himself into the project of tracing
what Gallagher calls ``pedigrees of degeneracy'' in a series of
Vermont families.
</P>
<P>
   Field workers selected particular ``notorious'' families and
issued reports with titles like ``The Results of the Matrimonial
Adventures of Four Degenerate Offspring of the Fourth Generation of
the Doolittle Family.''
</P>
<P>
   The reports drew on interviews with neighbors and local
officials, and were sometimes supplemented with estimates of the
families' cost to taxpayers, terming one extended family
``Expensive Luxuries.'' One researcher reported that ``the state of
Vermont would have been better off had Richard, Simon, John and
Joseph of Generation III not been allowed to produce children.''
</P>
<P>
   The work paid off for Perkins in 1931, when a sterilization bill
finally passed, and between then and the early 1960s, the state
would fund and arrange sterilizations, often on young men and women
living in institutions for the ``feebleminded'' or handicapped,
frequently as a condition of release.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is plenty of anecdotal evidence about
sterilization policy, particularly among the Abenaki, there is no
documentation of how widespread the phenomenon was, or how the
option was presented to its subjects. The only published summary of
state sterilization, from the 1940s, puts the number at 212,
although many suspect the real number is higher, Dann said.
</P>
<P>
   The eugenics movement radically changed direction in the 1930s,
as people recoiled from the Nazis' ``race hygeine.'' When Perkins's
student Elin Anderson published a 1937 study of Burlington called
``We Americans,'' her work showed less nostalgia for the ``old
pioneer stock'' and assigned positive value to racial diversity. By
1940, Perkins himself realized that his early ideas were
unacceptable, and omitted from his abstracts any mention of the
years spent following Vermont's ``degenerates.''
</P>
<P>
   And that whole project would have faded into obscurity except
for a pair of accidents: Perkins's proud record keeping and Dann's
chance discovery of 40 crates of surveys in the laundry room of a
state mental hospital in the mid-1980s. He quickly realized that
the history was still painfully fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can still go into high schools in Vermont and mention the
families that were studied and they'll say, `They're still the
troublemakers,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Abenaki _ who, historians have established, made up a
large contingent of the families Perkins studied _ the
sterilization law is hardly history at all. April Rushlow, the
31-year-old Abenaki acting chief, said that female relatives of her
father's generation were sterilized without their consent, and that
stories of the Perkins research were not taught in school but were
``passed down through the elders of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   To her, Rushlow said, Perkins has always seemed ``just like
Hitler.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent spike of scholarly interest has drawn mixed
responses, she said _ on the one hand, printing the history of
Perkins's project could ``finally let the public know what
happened.'' But the historians' interest has also churned up
painful episodes that had been ``kind of buried.'' She told of a
53-year-old man who realized five years ago, after reading a
revisionist account of the closing of the Brandon Home for the
Feebleminded, that he had probably been sterilized when he was 7.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Gallagher, who taught biology in Vermont schools for
years, is haunted by another possibility: That at some point,
unknowingly, she may have popularized scientific inquiry with
equally horrifying applications. Right now she's worried about the
human genome project. After reading through boxes of Perkins's
pedigrees, she'll never be as trustful of science, or of herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It humbles you,'' she said. ``To their dying day they probably
thought they were doing the right thing.''

 &HT;    VLADIMIR PUTIN: THE 'GRAY CARDINAL' WHO WOULD BE KING
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-YELTSIN-0810.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A little more than a year ago, Vladimir Putin was an
obscure bureaucrat and former spy, among the dozens of players who
fade in and out of President Boris Yeltsin's circle of Kremlin
advisers, government appointees and political pawns.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 46-year-old Putin has become the most conspicuous
politician in Moscow who, if he can prove his staying power, could
become Russia's next president in the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin tapped Putin as the latest in a line of prime ministers
to run the distressed Russian government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kremlin decided Putin is more reliable and tougher'' than
the man he replaces, Sergei Stepashin and a line of previous prime
ministers, said Andrei Piontkovsky, a political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   The sandy-haired and soft-spoken Putin received on Monday an
unconditional endorsement from Yeltsin as the man Russians should
choose to replace him when his term expires next summer. It is a
nod Yeltsin has been reluctant to give anyone else until now.
</P>
<P>
   But little is known about Putin beyond his extensive and shadowy
career in the Soviet and Russian security services, and the intense
loyalty he purportedly shows to his political masters.
</P>
<P>
   The man who would replace Yeltsin is touted as a smart and savvy
administrator. He made a successful leap from cold warrior to new
Russian policymaker. But there is not much of a record to suggest
his political leanings or depth of commitment to democracy and
market reforms.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation from Leningrad University in 1975, Putin was a
Soviet-era spy. He served a posting in foreign espionage as an
agent in Germany. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in
1991, Putin retired from the Russian KGB with the rank of colonel
and went to work for the local government in St. Petersburg
(formerly Leningrad).
</P>
<P>
   He rose to the post of vice mayor under liberal mayor Anatoly
Sobchak. Known as a colorless, but effective, administrator he
earned the nickname the ``gray cardinal'' -- operating in the
shadows of his boss.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he came to Moscow in a move arranged by market reformer
Anatoly Chubais, a close Yeltsin advisor in the mid-1990's. Putin
became the deputy Kremlin administrator and later was put in charge
of the Kremlin's relations with Russia's powerful regional
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Putin was named head of the domestic security
service, the FSB, an arm of the former KGB, and in March was also
named secretary of the president's Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   With more experience in security than politics, some analysts
question whether Putin is suited for the job of prime minister, or
president. He is an awkward public speaker and rarely appears on
television.
</P>
<P>
   His rise to prominence is the result of an act more suited to a
monarchy than a democracy. Putin's ascendancy comes because the
imperial president -- a man long ago dubbed Tsar Boris because of
his vast constitutional powers -- has chosen Putin as his heir.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appearance of Putin on the political scene in Russia
inspires anxiety rather than hope for the future of the country,''
said political analyst Andrei Cherkizov.

 &HT;    YELTSIN PICKS HIS SUCCESSOR AFTER SACKING ANOTHER PM
 &HT;    825&AMP;ADD

 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin thrust Russia into yet another
political crisis Monday by abruptly firing the prime minister he
appointed only three months ago and replacing him with a man
Yeltsin said should become the troubled country's next president.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Stepashin, who was appointed in May, became the fourth
prime minister sacked by Yeltsin in the past 17 months. Visibly
stunned, he appeared on television before a morning cabinet meeting
to announce that he and the government had been dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   His replacement is an ex-KGB spy during the Soviet era who most
recently was head of Russia's security service, the FSB. Vladimir
Putin, 46, became acting prime minister and received Yeltsin's
explicit endorsement to run for president next year with the
Kremlin's backing.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden move, apparently motivated solely by election-season
politics, raised anew questions about Yeltsin's failing health and
his ability to lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to explain madness,'' Boris Nemtsov, a former deputy
prime minister, said in a Russian radio interview. ``The people
have grown tired of watching an ill leader who is not capable of
doing his job.''
</P>
<P>
   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov called it ``100 percent
lunacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The national currency, the ruble, and the Moscow stock market
fell sharply after the morning announcement. Seeking to calm
financial markets, Putin said there would be no changes in the
government cabinet members controlling Russia's foreign and
economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   The government shuffle comes one year after mounting financial
woes and similar political turmoil last August hastened a national
economic crisis from which Russia is still seeking to recover.
</P>
<P>
   The lower house of parliament, the Duma, is scheduled to begin
considering Putin's nomination for prime minister on Monday. Some
analysts predicted that he could receive fairly swift confirmation
from the Communist-controlled Duma, in part because legislators
want to avoid a protracted fight as they prepare for parliamentary
elections in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Duma is skeptical and cynical. They've ceased to care who
the prime minister is,'' said Andrei Piontkovsky, director of the
Strategic Studies Center, a Moscow think tank.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Clinton administration reacted cautiously,
saying it is ready to work with Putin. ``Clearly it is within
President Yeltsin's prerogative'' to make such a change, said David
Leavy, a national security spokesman for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials most recently worked with Putin in resolving
Russia's role in the NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo, Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
   While Stepashin's firing was dramatic, it was not entirely
unexpected. The move was widely viewed in Moscow as a ploy to
promote the loyal Putin and to protect the political and financial
after-life of Yeltsin's inner circle -- known as ``the family'' --
when the president's term expires next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family probably looked for a more reliable figure that
could serve as Yeltsin's successor, the main thing being to
preserve the very existence of the family,'' said Communist
parliament member Viktor Illyukhin.
</P>
<P>
   National parliamentary elections are scheduled for Dec. 19 and
the presidential election is set to take place next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition political parties have been maneuvering in recent
weeks to consolidate their power, wooing former Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, a potential presidential candidate and --
according to some reports -- Stepashin, too. Last week, the Moscow
mayor and presidential aspirant, Yuri Luzhkov, sealed a deal with
influential regional leaders that virtually marked the start of the
2000 presidential campaign year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the constitution, Yeltsin is prohibited from seeking a
third term to office. In a nationally televised address, Yeltsin
called Putin ``a man who in my opinion is capable of uniting
society, based on the broadest political forces, to ensure the
continuation of reforms in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin added: ``I trust him. I also want everyone who goes to
the (presidential) polls in July 2000 to make their choice to trust
him too.''
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin's blessing may prove to be a curse. Yeltsin has
remained for more than a year dismally low in public opinion polls
and his endorsement of Putin is likely to mean little to Russian
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has ``put a hex on Putin,'' said Gennady Seleznyov,
chairman of the Duma. ``All those whom Yeltsin once called his
successor have no political future now,'' Seleznyov said, adding
that the president ``cannot and must not deprive the people of the
right to make their own choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Kremlin connection gives the uncharismatic and
politically untested Putin a vast resource of financing and media
support from the business tycoons aligned with Yeltsin since he won
reelection in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Putin declared his candidacy in his first remarks after being
nominated by Yeltsin. ``I will undoubtedly run for president,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin had just returned Sunday night from visiting the
embattled southern border, where Russian forces have been drawn in
recent days into heavy fighting with Islamic militants in the
mountainous Russian border republic of Dagestan. The region is near
the breakaway republic of Chechnya, where Russia fought a
disastrous war from 1994-96.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts and Yeltsin opponents have suggested that the
Kremlin could use the combat against the insurgent militants as a
pretext for declaring emergency rule and thus postponing the
parliamentary and presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   The communist leader, Zyuganov predicted Monday that Yeltsin
would impose emergency rule as a rationale for remaining in office.
</P>
<P>
   In his departing remarks to the cabinet, Stepashin said Russia
risks losing control of the Dagestan republic.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin, who had been a former interior minister, had himself
been considered a possible handpicked successor for Yeltsin. By

 &HT;    'DAY TRADERS' LOSING THEIR MARKET GAMBLE, REPORT SAYS

   WASHINGTON _ Most ``day traders'' suffer substantial stock
market losses, state securities regulators said in a report Monday
that criticized brokers for failing to adequately warn their
customers of the high risks.
</P>
<P>
   The North American Securities Administrators Association said
most day traders were unlikely to profit because they sold winning
stocks quickly, but held on to losing ones in hopes they would
recover.
</P>
<P>
   After analyzing accounts at one brokerage firm, the group
concluded that 70 percent of all those who engage in rapid-fire
trading ``will not only lose, but will almost certainly lose
everything they invest.''
</P>
<P>
   One such big loser was Mark O. Barton, who murdered nine people
at two Atlanta day trading firms last month, as well as his wife
and two children, before killing himself.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has obtained Barton's
trading records from both Momentum Securities and All-Tech
Investment Group. The SEC will probe whether Barton pursued the
typical strategy of letting his losses ride on his way to dropping
as much as $450,000 on volatile Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators' survey of typical day-trading conduct was
released 11 days after Barton's shooting rampage.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying report, based on a seven-month probe of a
dozen day-trading firms, the regulators said the firms often misled
investors with tales of potential wealth, accepted customers who
insufficient funds to invest over time, and failed to keep accurate
records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day trading is ... a particularly risky program of trading
that warrants heightened suitability and disclosure requirements,''
said the report. It urged regulators to step up their monitoring
role and to ban banning private lending between clients, which
sometimes allows big losers to continue trading after losing their
original stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``If day-trading firms want to become part of the mainstream,
they need to play by the same rules the rest of Wall Street
follows,'' said Peter Hildreth, president of the association, which
represents securities regulators in the 50 states, Canada and
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't get their act together they will be under
increasing regulatory pressure,'' said Hildreth, who also serves as
New Hampshire's director of securities regulation.
</P>
<P>
   At a crowded press conference, David Shellenberger, the primary
author of the 46-page report and chief of licensing at the
Massachusetts Securities Division, said ``day trading is
fundamentally no different than going to Las Vegas or Atlantic
City.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question, Shellenberger said it would be ``a
Herculean task'' for day traders to keep track of all trades _ for
some, hundreds in a few hours _ so they could file income tax
returns on profits and losses, as the law requires.
</P>
<P>
   Momentum Securities, in whose Atlanta office Barton killed four
people,
</P>
<P>
   did not directly respond to the report. But the Electronic
Traders Association, headed by Momentum's president, James H. Lee,
said in a statement, ``We will cooperate with lawmakers and
regulators to encourage appropriate regulation to protect day
traders and to make securities markets more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   The traders association questioned the validity of the survey
that came with the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowhere near 70 percent'' of day traders lose their money,
said Saul Cohen, counsel for the association.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had a large number of people losing all their money,
wouldn't you think you would have the SEC all over it?'' Cohen
asked. ``There's a kind of lack of common sense and logic ... to
the numbers in the report.''
</P>
<P>
   The traders association also objected to the idea of changing
the current rule allowing customers to make loans to one another.
That is a commonly accepted practice in the securities industry and
is not limited to day traders, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Houtkin, chief executive officer of All-Tech Investment
Services Inc., reacted more strongly in a telephone interview from
the company's headquarters in Montvale, N.J., calling the report
``a piece of trash.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a self-serving document,'' Houtkin said. ``I would have a
hard time being associated with this document, it's just that
poorly done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We give people a real shot to be successful. We give people
direct access to the market,'' he said. ``For them to come out
against us is just such an outrage, it makes me crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Complaints against day trading firms are rare, Houtkin said,
adding that regulators shouldn't adopt a tougher stance against the
industry just because of Barton's shooting rampage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just a madman who happened to be a day trader,'' he
said. ``To create a link between the two borders on
irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   The regulatory group's survey involved a detailed study of 30
accounts chosen at random at All-Tech's Watertown, Mass., office.
</P>
<P>
   The results defied the classic definition of day trading, which
calls for all stock positions to be liquidated before the end of
each session, thus allowing for a fresh start on the next trading
day.
</P>
<P>
   The actual trading pattern, however, showed the average losing
trade was held twice as long (9.53 days), as the average winning
trade (4.52 days). The average intraday trade also went into the
losing column.
</P>
<P>
   ``In short, these short-term traders were cutting their profits
short and letting their losses run,'' noted Ronald Johnson, an
investment consultant from Palm Harbor, Fla., who conducted the
analysis. Such a course runs directly counter to the widely held
market strategy of cutting losses quickly and leaving profits on
the table.

<P>
   ``On a scale from 1 to 10, how much pain are you in?'' a
laboratory technician asks Bernard Kingsley.
</P>
<P>
   Kingsley is lying, cramped, inside a huge magnet, in a space
narrow and claustrophobic enough to panic even the brave. A padded
cradle, an antenna wrapped around it, envelops his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six,'' he replies.
</P>
<P>
   Increase the pain, orders one of the doctors. Kingsley's legs,
stretched out on a flat board, are raised a bit higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much now?'' the technician asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight,'' Kingsley signals.
</P>
<P>
   The magnet emits rhythmical pings. Numbers flash by on computer
screens, as activity in Kingsley's brain is translated into
pictures at a rate of 40 images per minute. The doctors and
technicians, standing inside a glass-enclosed control room, watch
silently.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much now?'' the technician asks again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine,'' Kingsley says.
</P>
<P>
   It may sound reminiscent of some sort of medieval torture
session. But in fact, Kingsley, a 39-year-old former construction
worker, is a volunteer, helping researchers try to understand how
pain works and to find better treatments for patients like him.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of the first participants in a groundbreaking new
series of studies: lying inside the magnetic resonance imaging
machine at the State University of New York's Health Science Center
in Syracuse, he is having moving pictures made of the pain cells in
his brain.
</P>
<P>
   Until very recently, doctors trying to gauge the severity of a
patient's pain have had to rely largely on what the patient,
himself, communicated _ through anything from a wince to a
blood-curdling scream.
</P>
<P>
   But using highly refined diagnostic devices like PET &UR;  &LR; _ &UR;  &LR; or
positron emission tomography &UR;  &LR; _ &UR;  &LR; scanning and functional magnetic
resonance imaging, or fMRI, scientists have been able for the first
time to peer deep into the brain and watch pain at work, ``lighting
up'' specific neurons.
</P>
<P>
   In studies of 14 patients, Dr. A. Vania Apkarian and a team of
neurologists, physicists and technicians at Syracuse have used fMRI
to locate cell groups in the cerebral cortex that are activated in
response to severe pain in the hand, in various back muscles and in
spinal cord or nerve tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Apkarian emphasized that it may be several years before the
mountains of computerized data the team has collected can be
analyzed and then used to improve or alter treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the early results seem highly promising,
especially when combined with knowledge of brain chemistry gained
during the 1980s and the availability of more effective
painkillers.
</P>
<P>
   Other research teams in this country and in Canada are
conducting similar studies. Dr. Karen D. Davis of the University of
Toronto and Toronto Western Hospital and her colleagues, for
example, are using imaging to observe changes that occur in the
brain cells of patients suffering chronic pain after a stroke or
spinal cord injury. They are also investigating the ``phantom''
pain many patients experience after a limb is amputated.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Howard Field, a neurologist and pain expert at the
University of California at San Francisco, called the work of
Apkarian, Davis and others ``a major revolution in medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   The research, he said, is helping dispel false notions about
pain. He said that some doctors, for example, have believed that it
was somehow less worthwhile to devote time and energy toward
lessening a patient's pain than it was to treat the underlying
disease or injury. And as late as the late  &UR; ' &LR; 80s, he said, ``the
myth persisted that somehow what goes on in the mind, or the cells
of the brain, is somehow less scientific or real than what goes on
physically in the body.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that pain, like blood pressure or body temperature,
can now be measured, Field said, will help persuade doctors that
patients' pain is very real. And it may reassure physicians who
treat the most-severe chronic pain, like that of cancer patients.
In the past, these doctors have often refrained from giving enough
pain medication to relieve suffering out of fear that their
patients might become ``hooked'' on the painkillers.
</P>
<P>
   Pain experts say that having better ways to measure pain also
will help protect health insurance companies from fraudulent
claims, and help policyholders prove that their claims are
legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   The first success in capturing a still image of pain in the
brain was reported in 1991 by a team of researchers in Montreal.
Dr. Jeanne D. Talbot of the University of Montreal, and Dr.
Catherine Bushnell of McGill University, who used PET scanning,
which, like fMRI, measures blood flow, to watch pain centers of the
brain as they processed messages transmitted by nerve cells at the
site of the injury.
</P>
<P>
   When heat was applied at different intensities to the arms of
eight right-handed male subjects, the researchers found, four
different groups of pain cells ``lit up'' at different intensities.
</P>
<P>
   In PET scanning, a radioactive tracer is injected into the
subject before the scan is taken. When the tracer reaches the
brain, detectors in the scanning machine are able to pick up
positrons _ positive antiparticles of electrons _ emitted by the
substance. The detectors determine where the positrons are located,
and computers translate the data into three-dimensional pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Since the discoveries in Montreal, imaging technology has
steadily improved. Using these new techniques, neurologists,
physicists and physiologists have in effect been given a tour of
pain, as it registers in 200 or more distinct regions of the
cerebral cortex.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most immediate uses of the new technology may be to
help identify patients who are suffering, but are unwilling or
afraid to ask for help.
</P>
<P>
   In a report last month in the Journal of the American Medical
Association, for example, Dr. Kathleen Foley, a pain-control
specialist at the Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan,
reported on the case of ``Mrs. L.,'' a 44-year-old cancer patient
she had treated. Mrs. L., Foley wrote, understated the amount of
pain she was in because she wanted to remain lucid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really opened my mouth to say I was in pain,'' Foley
quoted the patient as saying, ``and the trade-off has been a total
fiasco.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs L. added: ``In my stupidity of wanting to stay awake, I say
that I'm not in pain, and I find out later that makes it so much
more difficult. I want to be awake and know everything that's going
on, for as long as humanly possible. But I do not want to die in
pain. I do not want to be in pain.''
</P>
<P>
   More common, pain experts say, are patients who could not hide
their pain if they wanted to. Apkarian said the first patients he
studied, for example, were suffering from severe hand pain, in each
case caused by some kind of accident. In these patients, he said,
pain recurred long after the wound had healed, and the patients'
hands were often so red and swollen that the nails were dropping
off.
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly no doubt that Kingsley is in pain.
Approaching the huge, donut-shaped M.R.I. machine during a recent
examination at University Hospital, he moved very slowly, his
suffering obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Kingsley is in pain about 70 percent of the day, every day, he
said. When he was 19, one vertebrae in the small of his back
started to slip down on another. Doctors told him he had better
stop lifting heavy things and consider changing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I didn't listen,'' he said. ``The lesson from me is that
if somebody tells you not to lift things, don't lift things.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when the pain became unbearable, he finally quit
his job. Two operations to insert pins in his back, readjusting the
position of the vertebrae, did not help. And heavy doses of
painkillers brought little relief.
</P>
<P>
   His doctors said they do not know why he suffers so much. Many
other people with the same or similar conditions do not approach
his level of pain, they said. They suggested that Kingsley might
want to join the first group of patients being studied at the
Syracuse center.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the laboratory, the MRI machine is sending radio waves
into Kingsley's brain while he lies positioned within the machine's
strong magnetic field. The waves interact with the nuclei of
hydrogen atoms in the cerebral cortex, in places where the pain is
registered. The nuclei, in turn, emit their own, smaller radio
signals, detected by the antenna in Kingsley's headrest, and
translated into images that change slightly as his pain worsens or
lessens.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Huckins, a doctoral student in brain mapping, instructs
Kingsley to use a set of hand signals to indicate to the team,
watching from the glassed-in control room, the level of pain he is
feeling as the technician raises his legs. After each trial, he is
allowed to rest for a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM HERE)
</P>
<P>
   (In Toronto, Davis and her group are developing a more
sophisticated, computerized system in which patients will roll
their hands on a track ball similar to the mouse on a computer.
This will allow pain to be measured on a more finely calibrated
scale, from 1 to 100. )
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM HERE)
</P>
<P>
   When Kingsley signals 9{ the trial is halted. It will take weeks
to analyze the data from his trial in detail, Apkarian said, but
the patterns generated by his brain seem, in preliminary analysis,
to resemble those of the five other back-pain patients he has
examined. They differ markedly, though, from those of six patients
with chronic hand pain and two patients with spinal disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had brain pictures of chronic pain before, and
they show that pain from different types of causes involved very
different areas of the brain,'' Apkarian said. ``And this seems to
mean they should be treated differently. Just how will have to be
subject to much more investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   After the session, Kingsley, clearly exhausted, says, ``It hurt
like hell. But I'm at the point where I'm willing to try
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've run out of options,'' he continues. ``So why not?''
</P>
<P>
   The doctors have told him that whatever they learn from the
research for which he has volunteered is unlikely to be of help to
him or to others, at least for several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``But all the patients who are willing and able to undergo this
very difficult ordeal say that if makes it possible for other
people not have to go what they have gone through, it is worth
it,'' Apkarian said.
</P>
<P>
   Kingsley falters only once, when he describes his past life, and
how he finally had to quit construction work when he could no
longer stand the pain. Tears come to his eyes. ``I can't even get
off the couch now to play with my grandchild,'' he says.

   Claire Messud's mesmerizing new book, ``The Last Life,'' is a
novel, her second it turns out, but the portrait it draws of a
family and its disintegration is so vivid, its rendering of the
conflicting claims of memory and denial so fraught with felt
emotion, that the reader might easily mistake it for a memoir.
</P>
<P>
   Told in the first person in the voice of a young woman named
Sagesse LaBasse, ``The Last Life'' chronicles the lives of three
generations of her French-Algerian family, which left Algiers
during the political upheavals of the 1950s to settle in the south
of France. It is a family that zealously guards its secrets, a
family that has created its own mythology as a defense against the
world, a family that naively believes that its pessimism is a
``bulwark against disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   During the summer of Sagesse's 15th year, a single violent act,
her grandfather's shooting of a teen-age girl, will loosen the
bonds of loyalty and compromise that have kept the clan together,
unleashing a torrent of rage and recrimination and flinging each of
its members ``into the ether alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing in dense, lyric prose, Ms. Messud has Sagesse recount
this story from two perspectives, recreating her 14- and
15-year-old self while at the same time glossing her blunt,
adolescent judgments with an older self's melancholy, retrospective
wisdom. As a result, the reader has a stereoscopic view of Sagesse
and her family. We witness her youthful efforts to cope with the
loss of her father, her home and her innocence, even as we are made
aware of the eventual emotional fallout of these losses; we watch
her try to put together the puzzle pieces of her family's past,
even as we are made aware of the formative events that caused each
of her relatives to choose a life of exile.
</P>
<P>
   Sagesse's grandfather Jacques LaBasse, we learn, left Algeria
when he realized that the days of the French colonists there were
numbered and he determined that ``the second half of his life would
redeem the humble first.'' He built the Hotel Bellevue on the
French Mediterranean and over the years turned it into a three-star
``haven of order and quiet for France's bonne bourgeoisie,''
presiding over its marbled hallways and manicured lawns with the
same tyrannical authority he exercised over his family.
</P>
<P>
   His son, Alexandre, Sagesse's father, would rebel against that
authority to little avail. Having vowed to stay in Algeria after
his parents had left, he found himself forced, by escalating
violence against the French, to follow them to France. And having
vowed not to buckle to his father's indomitable will, he found
himself forced to depend on his family's largess after Sagesse's
brother, Etienne, was born brain-damaged and physically impaired.
</P>
<P>
   For her parents, Sagesse observes, Etienne's birth signaled
``the clanging of their prison door,'' trapping both of them in an
arduous marriage of betrayal and resentment. Though Alexandre would
insist on ``a fiction of love at first sight,'' theirs was a
mismatch from the start. Carol, Sagesse's American-born mother,
tried her best to reinvent herself as a Frenchwoman, but she could
never win the acceptance of her husband's imperious parents, and
her discovery of Alexandre's many affairs would lead to a further
chilling of the marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The young Sagesse takes her mother's side, denouncing her father
as a cold, selfish man whose ``malignant presence'' was
``unconvincingly masked by his cheerful smiles and premeditated
caresses.'' Only later, years after his suicide, would she ``wonder
what it was to be my father, stoked with self-loathing, to observe
the world through the sheen of failure: born of a failed country, a
mediocre businessman trailing in his father's footsteps, an
unsatisfactory spouse, the father of a son who could never grow up,
seeking always and again the moment of conquest when he might
escape his history, himself, and soar unburdened for a stolen
hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between Alexandre and Carol escalate in the wake of an
impetuous, coldblooded act by Jacques, who, angered by the sound of
children splashing in the hotel pool, fires a gun in their
direction, wounding one of Sagesse's friends. The incident creates
one of those fault lines after which nothing is ever the same: It
isolates the LaBasse family from the community and precipitates the
disclosure of ancient family secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The incident and its aftermath also cut Sagesse off from her
friends and her former life. Henceforth her teen-age romanticism
will be tempered by a defensive cynicism, her nostalgia for an
Algeria she never knew qualified by the sad knowledge of her
family's racist politics.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Messud writes with enormous authority in these pages,
although some of Sagesse's grown-up meditations can sound wordy and
portentous: ``And mixed with fear and dismay lies an undeniable,
glittering anticipation, a detached curiosity: something must
happen that I cannot foresee; noon will come, and evening, and
tomorrow.'' Happily, such lapses are infrequent, and Ms. Messud
delineates Sagesse's efforts to come to terms with her past and to
forge a new identity and sense of self with sympathy and
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Last Life,'' however, is not simply another coming-of-age
story: It opens out beyond the bounds of the usual Bildungsroman to
become a thoughtful meditation upon the uses of personal and public
history and the need people have for creating narratives, fictions
if you will, about their families and themselves. Ms. Messud has
written a large and resonant novel that is as artful as it is
affecting.

<P>
   AMARGOSA VALLEY, Nev. _ For more than 20 years, scientists have
been trying to figure out if Yucca Mountain, a barren desert ridge
in southern Nevada, is a suitable burial ground for the nation's
deadliest radioactive waste.
</P>
<P>
   After years of analysis, debate and political maneuvering, they
now say the answer may lie inside tiny crystals glittering in
finger-wide crevices and football-sized cavities that pockmark the
walls of the mountain's dusty tunnels. It is here, if the
Department of Energy gets its way, that canisters would be sealed
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists believe the crystals were formed by hot water
welling up from under the mountain in the last half-million years.
That would mean hot underground water has invaded the mountain and
might again in the time when radioactive waste would still be
extremely dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The results would be catastrophic. Hot water would rapidly
corrode the canisters and dissolve the water. Radioactive steam
would vent from the mountain and contaminated water would spread
underground.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists believe the crystals were formed when the
volcanic ash that makes up Yucca Mountain was laid down millions of
years ago, and that the crystals continued to grow as rainwater
carried minerals such as calcium carbonate and opal through
fractures in the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   In this view, hot water would be unlikely to invade the mountain
again. Rainwater might still percolate through it, but the water
could be shunted around the waste for as long as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   It is no coincidence that the first group, which says the
calcite crystals prove that Yucca Mountain is a poor place to store
atomic waste, works for the state of Nevada, which opposes the
project. The scientists who say that the crystals pose no problem
for a waste repository work for the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have been searching for a place to bury the waste
since 1954, when the Atomic Energy Act allowed commercial nuclear
reactors to generate electricity and assigned responsibility for
the spent nuclear fuel to the federal government. Over the years,
as radioactive waste accumulated in holding tanks at nuclear power
plants around the country, the search for a site became a political
hot potato and a difficult scientific question.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act mandated that two sites be
selected, one in the East and one in the West. But five years
later, Congress told the Energy Department to study only Yucca
Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   From above, Yucca Mountain looks like a wave breaking over
Amargosa Valley, about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nev. In
cross section, the mountain looks like a slightly tilted layer
cake, with some layers of compacted ash that are as soft as
sandstone, and other layers of welded ash as hard as granite. The
layers were formed by massive volcanic eruptions 12 million to 15
million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   About 4 to 10 inches of rain falls on Yucca Mountain each year,
barely enough to support a thin cover of grass and the creosote
bush, but it is the water that will make or break the proposed
repository.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the Yucca Mountain waste site have seized on the
crystals as evidence that could disqualify the site. A geologist
from the University of Nevada at Las Vegas has been asked to
determine the age of the crystals and to analyze microscopic
bubbles of air and water that were trapped inside some of them.
This should help to determine whether they formed in hot or cool
water, that is, whether they are evidence of a relatively recent
invasion of hot water.
</P>
<P>
   But other questions about the mountain's suitability as a
storage site for radioactive waste will not be as easy to answer;
some may never be resolved, although advocates hope to obtain
enough information to satisfy federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a scientific peer review panel convened by the
Energy Department produced what it called a ``highly critical''
report on the department's own assessment of Yucca Mountain,
especially its computer model of what would happen to the waste
once it was stored.
</P>
<P>
   The review panel said the model had so many uncertainties _ like
the corrosion rates of the waste containers, the area's
vulnerability to earthquakes and how climate changes would affect
rainfall _ that its reliability was limited.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the review panel concluded, predicting how radioactive
waste would behave once it is stored in the mountain ``may be
beyond the analytical capabilities of any scientific and
engineering team.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, advocates of using Yucca Mountain for the storage project
are confident they can convince the Energy secretary, the
president, Congress and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to
approve the site. Their optimism was bolstered last week by a draft
environmental impact statement by the Energy Department that
suggested disposal at Yucca Mountain would be safer, in the long
run, than leaving waste at the 77 sites around the country where it
is now stored.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Energy Department is moving ahead on repository
designs to submit to the Energy secretary in 2001 and licensing
hearings before the NRC beginning in 2002. Construction of the
repository would begin around 2005 and it would begin accepting
waste in 2010. The cost of the project is expected to be about $43
billion over the next century. It would be financed by a tax on
nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has already spent $3 billion, making this
desolate ridge one of the most intensely studied spots on Earth.
``We think we can handle the uncertainty,'' said Dr. Michael D.
Voegele, the senior engineer in charge of licensing and regulation
for the project. ``This is technically an awesome site. The picture
fits together very well at Yucca Mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the past year major changes have been made in the
proposed design of the repository. Just last year project
scientists favored a so-called hot design in which waste canisters
in closely spaced tunnels would heat the entire repository area
above boiling temperature and drive water away from the waste for
thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   But when some scientists voiced uncertainty about what would
happen to water that might collect above the repository, the design
was scrapped in favor of tunnels spaced farther apart _ 81 meters
rather than 20 meters _ so the boiling regions around each tunnel
would not overlap and water could drain between them. The change
also simplified the construction of computer models: Scientists can
now model each tunnel independently.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Those design changes take a lot of the larger uncertainties
off the table,'' said Dr. Chris Whipple, the chairman of the
critical peer review panel.
</P>
<P>
   Water has always been the major uncertainty at Yucca Mountain.
Different estimates on the amount of water that could seep through
the mountain has led to calculations for radiation release ``that
vary by several orders of magnitude,'' a report released in June by
the NRC shows.
</P>
<P>
   A five-mile tunnel drilled into Yucca Mountain to test its
suitability was dry and dusty. But water is locked in tiny pores
and is flowing through fractures in the rock.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are conducting the first full-scale test of heated
mock radioactive waste casks to see how the heat affects water in
the rock. Hot water poured from a bore hole when scientists took
samples in July.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have been probing Yucca Mountain for two decades, but
they continue to be surprised by the water. Originally, the
volcanic ash where the waste would be buried, 800 feet below the
surface and 1,000 feet above the water table, was thought to be so
tightly compressed that water would not flow through.
</P>
<P>
   But as they dug into the mountain, scientists found that the
compressed ash was riddled by an average of 15 to 30 fractures per
meter, fractures through which water could flow. They thought the
water would move slowly through the fractures because there is so
little rainfall in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   But last year scientists found Chlorine 36, a chemical isotope
left by atmospheric atomic bomb testing in the 1950s, had trickled
down fractures to the repository level. That meant rainwater had
percolated halfway through the mountain in just 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   And at the nearby Nevada Test Site, scientists found that
plutonium from underground bomb tests had hitched a ride on
microscopic specks of clay suspended in ground water and had
traveled 1.3 kilometers in 30 years, much faster than they had
expected.
</P>
<P>
   All of these variables go into the model that predicts whether
the repository can contain radioactive waste long enough so it does
not pose a health risk for people when radioactive particles
eventually do leak from corroded canisters into the groundwater.
</P>
<P>
   Project scientists predict that most of the 10,039 radioactive
waste containers in Yucca Mountain would survive for about 10,000
years.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists assume, however, that at least one of the
canisters would fail within 1,000 years because of manufacturing
defects, and that all of the canisters would corrode after 10,000
years. During the first 10,000 years the most potent radioactive
emitters, cesium and strontium, would have decayed. Plutonium,
neptunium, iodine and technetium decay much more slowly and are not
strong emitters. The major harm to humans would come from ingesting
the particles.
</P>
<P>
   During the hundreds of thousands of years the radioactive waste
inside Yucca Mountain would remain dangerous, scientists expect
that climate changes would leave this desert somewhat more lush and
green, with trees covering the now bare flanks of Yucca Mountain
and lakes forming in the arid valleys below. If that would happen,
more water would move through the mountain, washing radioactive
waste into the groundwater, thus diluting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some sense it's science fiction to project out 300,000
years,'' said Abraham E. Van Luik, policy adviser for performance
assessment. ``It gets more and more difficult to defend your
assumptions as you move into the future. But our modeling is
over-conservative. Absolutely nobody is going to get hurt by this
repository for hundreds of thousands of years.''
</P>
<P>
   If there are farmers then in the Amargosa Valley, about 20 miles
away, as there are now, they would be the first to drink
contaminated water and use it on their crops. At 10,000 years,
project scientists predict, people in the valley would be exposed
to an additional 0.007 millirems of radioactivity a year, well
below the 25 millirem maximum limit suggested by the NRC in
proposed regulations for the repository. It would take 310,000
years to reach the 25 millirem dose, the scientists say, as more
contaminated water leaked.
</P>
<P>
   The peak dose of 85 millirems a year would come in 620,000
years, the scientists predict. Most people are exposed to
background radiation of about 300 millirems a year, half of that
from natural sources like the sun, and the other half from sources
like medical procedures and radon that collects in buildings.
</P>
<P>
   These predictions are not necessarily reassuring in Nevada.
``Yucca Mountain does not provide geologic isolation,'' said Steven
A. Frishman, a geologist and technical adviser to the Nevada
Nuclear Waste Project Office. ``Yucca Mountain is not capable of
keeping it where you put it. It's not a question of will it be
contained, but how fast will it leak out.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Energy Department goes ahead and recommends Yucca
Mountain in 2001 and the president approves, Nevada Gov. Kenny
Guinn has vowed to formally object. In that case, Congress could
override the state's objection with a majority vote in both the
House and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists believe that even though Yucca Mountain has been
debated for 20 years the process is moving too fast for a decision
that would have consequences for many millenniums.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't be rushing the process,'' said Dr. Allison
Macfarlane, a science fellow at Harvard University's Kennedy School
of government who is studying Yucca Mountain. ``We should make sure
we get it right. This is a really complex project, maybe more
complex than the Manhattan Project. You're trying to predict
geologic processes over geologic time lines. That's really
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department concedes that the project may not be
operating by 2010, as it now plans. ``There is certainly science
left to do and being done,'' said Dr. Ernest Moniz, the under
secretary of Energy who oversees scientific research at Yucca
Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``One way or another we've got to advance toward
geological disposal. We're pushing it hard. The science case is
building up nicely. If we have to delay in the end we'll delay. But
I see no reason not to push forward.''

ACTRESS WHO STARRED IN `PLANET OF THE APES' AMAZED AT FILM'S
APPEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By TERRY PACE   
 TimesDaily, Florence, Ala.  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year marked the 30th anniversary of a genuine milestone in
science-fiction moviemaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Planet of the Apes,'' a frightening, futuristic thriller about
a world in which apes are the dominant species and humans are mute
savages, revolutionized the genre with its mature,
thought-provoking marriage of imagination and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Released in 1968, ``Planet of the Apes'' inspired four hit
sequels, two short-lived television series and millions of devoted
fans. Through it all, original ``Apes'' heroine Linda Harrison now
54 and a favorite attraction at science fiction conventions _
remains pleasantly amazed by the movie's timeless appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew for years that it was popular, but I had no idea of the
depth and breadth of its fan base until I started doing
conventions,'' said Harrison, who played the silent but pivotal
role of Nova, a human primitive who becomes the mate of a stranded
astronaut played by Charlton Heston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's had a profound effect on people, and the audience is
still growing,'' Harrison said. ``It's very much alive today &UR; , &LR; 
even more so than when we first made it.''
</P>
<P>
   In conjunction with the film's 30th-anniversary celebration,
20th Century-Fox has staged an ambitious ``Apes'' revival.
Highlights include the production of a comprehensive documentary,
``Behind the Planet of the Apes,'' plus the release of digitally
restored, wide-screen editions of all five ``Apes'' features
``Planet of the Apes,'' ``Beneath the Planet of the Apes,''
``Escape from the Planet of the Apes,'' ``Conquest of the Planet of
the Apes'' and ``Battle for the Planet of the Apes'' in a deluxe
edition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first `Apes' came out during the time of the Vietnam War,
the civil-rights struggle and assassinations,'' Harrison said.
``Profound issues that needed attention were at the forefront of
people's minds. I don't believe that the filmmakers set out to make
a political picture at all. I think the writers were just
reflecting what their experience was at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Planet of the Apes'' was based on a novel by French writer
Pierre Boulle, who also wrote ``The Bridge on the River Kwai.'' The
movie centers on a crew of astronauts who travel forward in time,
landing on an alien planet where simians are the civilized rulers
and humans are hunted like beasts. As Nova, Harrison used her
skills as a former acrobat to perfect her highly physical,
``subhuman'' role _ with no dialogue whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The director, Franklin J. Schaffner, was such a reflective and
thoughtful man,'' Harrison said. ``We just seemed to talk about her
and think about her and how she would react in different
situations. Nova may not have had advanced mental capacity, but she
was a human being, and she had feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of ``Planet of the Apes,'' all but one
astronaut dies either in the crash of their spacecraft or at the
hands of the apes. The sole survivor is their leader, Taylor
(Heston), whose intelligence and ability to speak alarms the apes
and threatens their rigid sense of absolute supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nova naturally was drawn to this incredible white man who
could speak and whose intelligence was much more advanced,''
Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by two sympathetic chimpanzee scientists (Roddy McDowall
and Kim Hunter), Taylor finally escapes with Nova, his only human
companion, into a barren region called the Forbidden Zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Planet of the Apes'' has a startling conclusion. Riding
horseback along the shoreline, Taylor and Nova come face-to-face
with the decaying remnants of the Statue of Liberty and the
revelation that the ``Planet of the Apes'' is the Earth of the
future.
</P>
<P>
   While Fox was considering a screen version of Boulle's
controversial novel, Harrison _ a contract player and former
Maryland beauty queen _ was dating her future husband, producer and
studio executive Richard Zanuck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember clearly when Dick first introduced the idea of the
movie to me,'' Harrison said. ``We were in a restaurant, and he was
enormously excited about it. He went on with great enthusiasm,
telling me the whole plot of the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   First, though, Harrison was enlisted to play the
progressive-minded chimpanzee Zira (the part eventually played by
Hunter) in test footage shot to determine the viability of the ape
makeup. The brief footage shown for the first time in the
``Behind'' documentary features Heston, Harrison, James Brolin (in
McDowall's role) and screen legend Edward G. Robinson (as the
aristocratic orangutan Dr. Zaius). Robinson disliked the
uncomfortable ape makeup and was replaced by Maurice Evans.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison and Zanuck, the son of Hollywood mogul Darryl F.
Zanuck, married in 1968 and had two sons, Harrison and Dean, who
are now both in the movie business. The couple divorced after eight
years.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison reprised her role as the shapely, raven-haired,
scantily clad Nova in the first ``Apes'' sequel, ``Beneath the
Planet of the Apes'' (1970). Heston's character disappears in the
opening scene, and Nova spends the rest of the film searching for
him with a newly arrived astronaut (James Franciscus). In an
apocalyptic conclusion, Nova dies after screaming her first and
last word ``Taylor!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, they had planned to end the first movie with the
implication that I was pregnant with Taylor's child,'' Harrison
said. ``At the last minute they decided against it. They were
afraid it would add an element to the story that they couldn't
resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the ``Apes'' films, Harrison's credits include
``Way, Way Out'' (1966) with Jerry Lewis and Gene Kelly's ``A Guide
for the Married Man'' (1967), plus the television series
``Bracken's World'' (1969-71) and appearances on ``Batman'' and
``Barnaby Jones.'' In 1975, billed as Augusta Summerland, she
reunited with Heston for ``Airport '75.''
</P>
<P>
   She recently performed a cameo in ``Runaway Bride,'' starring
Richard Gere and Julia Roberts. The romantic comedy was shot in
Harrison's hometown of Berlin, Md. Her role, however, was cut from
the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played myself, Linda Harrison, the girl who was Nova in
`Planet of the Apes,''' she said. ``I enjoyed the experience, and
I'm excited about the film because it was shot in Berlin.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Apes'' anniversary and persistent rumors of a Hollywood
remake _ with directors as diverse as James Cameron and Oliver
Stone _ have intensified interest in Harrison and her ``Apes''
co-stars. In addition to her appearances at sci-fi conventions,
Harrison has own Web site at www.lindaharrison.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web site and conventions are a way for me to reach out to
people,'' said Harrison. ``People who are basically strangers come
up to me, ask me to sign autographs and tell me things that touch
me deeply. It's important for me to speak with them and share time
with them. There's a bond happening between us, and I consider that
a wonderful privilege.''

<P>
   DALLAS _ Dorcy Siegel grew up in North Dallas in a spacious home
with a generous yard and a short drive to shopping malls and movie
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Now she lives in a 600-square-foot apartment with no yard, far
from the nearest mall. She wouldn't have it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a completely unique experience.'' she says. ``I can walk
to work. I can walk to the gym. Last Saturday night, I had about 35
people over and we walked to the Gold Bar in the Titche-Goettinger
building (a department store turned into loft apartments). It was a
novelty for them to actually walk somewhere in Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   An urban planner, she lives in downtown Dallas in the Kirby
Residences, one of many loft developments that, along with dozens
of more conventional townhouse and apartment units sprouting just
outside the central business district, are beginning to remake the
face and culture of a city that once seemed hell-bent on escaping
from itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine living anywhere else,'' Siegel says. ``It's
like a campus feel. I have a rooftop pool. Two of my friends live
two stories above me. Everything's familiar and comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   She is typical of the ``urban pioneers'' who are driving an
almost insatiable demand for downtown living.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's happening in a lot of cities,'' says Greg Willett of M/PF
Research. Downtown Houston also is undergoing a major residential
makeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Dallas and Atlanta are ahead of everyone else and Dallas
is better positioned than most markets,'' said Willett.
</P>
<P>
   Loft living is not exactly new to Dallas, but when the first
units were carved out of abandoned warehouses more than 15 years
ago, the tenants were mostly artists or photographers needing cheap
living and working space or twentysomethings drifting through their
Bohemian phase. They stayed until they could afford something
better, or the novelty faded, or they married or had children. Then
they sought more conventional digs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no demand (for downtown residences) because it
wasn't offered,'' Willett says.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 M/PF was hired by the Central Dallas Association to
determine the potential demand if upscale living quarters were
available. The results were surprising even to those most
optimistic about a rebirth of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a latent market,'' says Larry Fonts, president of
the CDA. ``That (research) determined there was a 24,500-unit
demand. Today, we have satisfied about half of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Who would want to live in downtown Dallas? By the end of the
1970s, the flight to the suburbs had threatened downtown's
viability even as an office park. Retailers moved to the malls, and
corporations were building headquarters in places such as Plano and
Las Colinas and points north. Once-fashionable inner-city
neighborhoods were going to slums and were selling at scrap prices.
</P>
<P>
   Then, an odd thing happened on the sprawl toward the Red River _
not a giant sucking sound, but a faint sipping that was drawing
fragments of the population back to the center of town.
</P>
<P>
   Their motives were mixed. Some were young and adventurous and
simply found the suburbs too monotonous. Others tired of long
commutes. Some sought liberation from the time and monetary demands
of maintaining a large house and yard when their children were no
longer around.
</P>
<P>
   And, suburbia had lost much of its idyllic luster. Crime,
disease, congestion, high taxes and other ills of the inner city
had also spread outward. Plano was wracked by a cluster of teen
suicides, followed by a wave of teen heroin overdose deaths. In
Allen, the school district is involved in a controversy over metal
detectors at the entrances to its classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent report titled ``The Social and Health Landscape of
Urban and Suburban America,'' the National Public Health and
Hospital Institute noted that poverty among suburban children under
the age of 6 had increased 50 percent during the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Inner cities also were becoming safer. Between 1990 and 1997,
violent crime declined 37 percent in Dallas, while falling by only
21 percent in its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   For many, living downtown became an attractive option, as well
as an adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lofts were romanticized,'' says Bennett Miller, one of the
pioneer loft developers in Dallas. ``People saw pictures of them in
magazines and newspapers from places like New York. They were
colorful and had a heavy romantic appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   With old warehouses and factory buildings available at prices
below outlying properties and with tax incentives on the table,
builders began conversions that went far beyond the starving
artist's studios. Rooftop pools, laundry rooms, fitness centers,
security patrols and enclosed parking were the norm. A restaurant
or bar on the premises was not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the loft units were leased before they were completed.
According to population estimates by the North Central Texas
Council of Governments, 31,000 people now live inside the ``freeway
ring'' of downtown Dallas and within a one-mile perimeter of it. An
additional 100,000 live within a three-mile perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown rents are relatively high _ $1 to $1.50 a square foot
per month, but the new urban dweller apparently can afford it.
</P>
<P>
   A survey last spring by the CDA found that almost half of
downtown residents have college degrees, three-fourths are
unmarried and two-thirds hold professional or managerial positions.
Their median income is $88,158.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are renters by choice,'' says Ed Ducoff, president of
Pace Realty, which manages the 1900 Elm lofts in the old
Titche-Goettinger building. ``They could easily afford a suburban
home if that's what they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Connie Jenkins, manager of the Santa Fe Terminal lofts, located
in a high-rise building that originally was a train station,
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we just had more 800-foot units,'' she sighs. ``We could
fill as many of those as we had.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Santa Fe, most of the loft developments have been small
_ 90 to 150 units _ but recently Matthews Southwest announced plans
to convert a massive old Sears, Roebuck and Co. catalog merchandise
center _ 30 acres of vacant buildings _ on the southern edge of
downtown into 450 apartments averaging 1,700 square feet. Retail
shops and restaurants and a Gilley's country-western entertainment
center will be a part of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the lofts, the perimeter of downtown is sprouting
large apartment, condominium and townhouse developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, we have an urban neighborhood,'' says Fonts,
who sold his North Dallas home and moved to a townhouse near
Dallas' new light rail station at City Place, a multiuse
development just north of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who want an urban lifestyle. They want the
convenience of being near their jobs. They want the security of
being able to lock the door and going away for the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   After migrating to downtown a year ago, Fonts says, he and his
wife discovered that the convenience ``vastly outweighed any sense
of inconvenience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My insurance costs went down. My utilities went down. My
homeowner's association fees are less than my pool maintenance
costs used to be, and I still have a pool. I'm less than seven
minutes to my office, door to door. There's a 16-screen movie
palace at City Place.''
</P>
<P>
   The restaurants of McKinney Avenue _ the main drag of ``Uptown''
Dallas _ and the live-music night life of Deep Ellum are just
blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   A mixture of public and private efforts combined to make
downtown an attractive residential option, Fonts says, and
downtown's new trains have been a major player.
</P>
<P>
   Developers of the Adams Mark hotel _ the largest in Texas _ have
cited rail as a factor in the decision to build the 2,000-room
hotel in downtown Dallas; Pete Coughlin of Maxwell Southwest says
the rail line played a large role in making the old Sears facility
viable for rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A rail line changes the whole nature of your location,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   New apartments are going up near the renovated and expanded
Farmer's Market. Ground has been broken on a new downtown sports
complex that eventually will result in more apartments, restaurants
and shops north of the West End entertainment district. Development
of parks and lakes on the Trinity River also is considered another
step toward rounding out the downtown neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, the Dallas-Fort Worth area has grown from 3 million
to 5 million people and projections are for the population to pass
7 million in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Developers are betting that downtown will share in that growth,
but some, including Bennett Miller, the pioneer of lofts, warn of
potential pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of amenities are still missing,'' Miller says. ``There
are no good schools downtown, no grocery stores. There is not the
kind of street life you see in New York or Chicago or Boston. It
will take a generation or two for that to come about.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the movement back to town appears to be more than a
fleeting fad. Dallas is running out of old buildings that can be
adapted to lofts and new ones, built to resemble old warehouses,
are filling up with occupants willing to forgo many of the suburban
trappings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a large grocery store belongs downtown,'' says
Dorcy Siegel. ``Dallas is still a driving town and I don't have to
drive much more than a mile to a supermarket. But I can still get
my Popsicle at the little store down the street.''

   &UR; ``THE DESCENT'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Jeff Long (Crown, $24)
</P>
<P>
   What this horror story loses in bizarre plot twists, it makes up
in audacity and dogged inventiveness. Long's setup goes on for
chapters, during which we meet lots of people and witness lots of
gore. In the end, we're sure of just one thing: Something awful
lives under the ground. It surfaces in an isolated Tibetan cave
where guide Ike Crockett takes refuge from a storm with a group of
wealthy (and doomed) clients. It surfaces in a South African leper
colony where a beautiful nun named Ali hears of a ``hungry God''
who kills men and chops them up for parts. And it surfaces in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, where NATO soldier Elias Branch watches
otherworldly creatures rise from a mass grave and attack his
crippled helicopter. The demons have already dispatched Branch's
navigator, hideously, but Branch survives to initiate the discovery
and exploration of a vast network of tunnels deep beneath the
Earth's surface, where are found body parts, crude jewelry and
footprints that aren't quite human. The penetration of the
underground becomes a worldwide military effort until more than
250,000 soldiers are slaughtered in the tunnels in a single day, a
well-planned mass execution that gives world leaders a sense of
what they're facing. ``Hell exists,'' the U.S. president announces.
``It is real. A geological, historical place beneath our very feet.
And it is inhabited. Savagely.'' Yes folks, it's Satan's empire
we're talking about here, and it's not pretty. Branch goes bravely
back into the tunnels, where he finds Ike Crockett alive after
years of captivity underground, and the ravaged Ike finds an odd
romance with Ali the nun. If Satan is a bit disappointing when he
finally shows up, you'll be too busy keeping up with all of the
other action to really care. It's a late summer page-turner that
you're unlikely to put down. &QL; 
 &UR; ``LETTERS FROM YELLOWSTONE''By Diane Smith (Viking, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This novel, written as a collection of letters, is set in 1898
and begins with a formal note from A.E. Bartram, a New York medical
student with a passion for botany, who asks to join a field study
of Yellowstone National Park. The request is greeted with
enthusiasm by the leader of the expedition, Montana Professor
Howard Merriam, and letters fly among Bartram, Merriam and their
families and colleagues before the expedition meets in Montana.
This early correspondence shows Bartram to be a clever, industrious
and ambitious young scientist who relishes the chance to make a
career in botany. Bartram's arrival in Montana causes confusion and
dismay, however, when Merriam learns that Alex Bartram is a woman _
and a determined one at that. She persists quietly as Merriam frets
about her ability to endure wilderness existence and about the
pragmatic obstacles of including a lone woman in a company of men.
But Bartram stays and becomes a delightful character. So does
Andrew Rutherford, a fellow scientist who writes amusingly about
the upheaval Alex's presence causes and about how ably she sticks
to the business at hand. Meanwhile, Howard Merriam's letters to his
mother reflect his growing respect for the woman he wanted so
desperately to send packing. Many things emerge in this story _ a
portrait of scientists at work at the turn of the century, a look
at the West at a time of change, the beauty and danger of
Yellowstone, and the story of a forthright woman and the men who
come to admire her. Smith began with a beguiling idea and has
turned it into an enchanting book. &QL; 
 &UR; ``TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE: THE COLOSSAL BOOK OF URBAN LEGENDS'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Jan Harold Brunvand (Norton, $29.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reading this is like going through photo albums _ the pleasure
is in the recognition. The most famous American urban legend is, of
course, ``The Hook'' (a homicidal maniac left it hanging on the car
door of a couple just returned from a lovers' lane). Then there's
``Kentucky Fried Rat,'' or, as New &AMP; Notable has always known it,
``Kentucky Fried Rodent,'' which leaves room for variation. ``The
Hairy-Armed Hitchhiker'' is good, or ``The Killer in the Back
Seat'' (this inspired a testy exchange between Brunvand and David
Letterman, which Brunvand describes here with some remorse). Or
there are the harmless ones, such as that Internet favorite about
the Neiman Marcus cookies. It's true, however, that many urban
legends are disgusting or disturbing or both (we like to tell
stories about the worst possible things that can happen to us), and
that this is where we throw all taste and political correctness to
the wind. There are legends about toilets, AIDS, dead babies, sex,
even pets-in-the-microwave _ something for everyone to enjoy. &QL; 
 &UR; ``BILL AND HILLARY: THE MARRIAGE''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Christopher Andersen (Morrow, $27.50) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was in Hillary's White House bedroom that Bill Clinton
finally told her that he had, indeed, had an affair with Monica
Lewinsky. As she sat, stunned, on the edge of her bed, Andersen
writes, ``the president of the United States got down on his knees
and, weeping, begged her forgiveness.'' We assume that Andersen was
crouched behind a nearby potted plant during this exchange, and
that he knew where all the White House plants were and moved from
one to the other in search of dirt. Of course, not all of his
information came by way of espionage. Some was procured from former
presidential adviser Dick Morris, who is on everyone's most-admired
list. Andersen (``The Day Diana Died'') looks at the Clintons from
courtship to current status, whatever that may be. Other than
painful descriptions of Chelsea Clinton's misery during the
Lewinsky revelations, it has the feel of old, tired news _ it made
us feel old and tired just to read it. We hope you fare better. &QL;

HEY GUYS, IT'S AUGUST 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ How did voters ever get the notion that the elected
politicians in the nation's capital are isolated from the real
world and out of touch with their constituents?
</P>
<P>
   Voters aren't stupid, that's how.
</P>
<P>
   The latest confirmation of the gap between ordinary folk and the
officials who represent them is the brilliant notion of both
Democrats and Republicans to devote this month to selling their
competing visions of how best to spend the budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled Congress passed a massive $795 billion
tax cut bill with goodies for everyone last week, the largest since
the President Reagan-sponsored cuts of 1981 that were so extreme
they had to be partially reversed. President Clinton has vowed to
veto the bill, charging it's a reckless giveaway to the rich that
would jeopardize basic domestic programs and long-term funding of
Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of promptly sending their partisan measure to the
president, the Republicans will sit on it during the congressional
summer recess to give themselves time to drum up support in the
public opinion polls. When Congress returns in September, the GOP
figures that voters will be clamoring for tax cuts and the
president will capitulate.
</P>
<P>
   Fat chance.
</P>
<P>
   Hasn't anyone noticed that August is the month the real world
goes on vacation? Just envision the excitement at the beach as
families put down their romance novels, throw away their snow cones
and debate the merits of the two approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's to do today, daddy?'' the little boy asks. ``Will you
take me fishing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, son, we'll have more fun than that,'' the father replies.
``We'll discuss all the thrilling ways to spend the federal
surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   Give it a rest, Washington suits. Nobody except political
junkies, who have already made up their minds on this issue anyway,
will be listening.
</P>
<P>
   We don't need August to discover that voters bring more common
sense to such clumsy, inflamed ideological debate than their
political leaders do.
</P>
<P>
   Voters tell the pollsters that tax cuts are fine: who wouldn't
want to pay less taxes?
</P>
<P>
   But they also say they give their highest priority to using the
projected surplus to pay down the national debt, protect Medicare
and spend on education, child care and other programs. They want to
use the surplus wisely for the general good, not waste it.
</P>
<P>
   The political truth is that both sides can make a persuasive
case, but they are so philosophically far apart that they both
can't be right.
</P>
<P>
   To pay for their huge tax cuts, the GOP will have to cut labor,
health, social services and education drastically to get around
prior budget spending ceilings, gutting programs that voters like.
But they claim individuals would rather have a few more nickels in
their pockets than supportive government services.
</P>
<P>
   Me, I think the president is correct to insist upon using the
surplus _ the ultimate size of which is very much in doubt _ to
strengthen Medicare and Social Security for the baby boomer crunch
to come. The surplus figures are based on shifting assumptions,
contradictory projections and phony budget gimmicks. Who knows?
Best to play it safe.
</P>
<P>
   Once the huge estimated sum is given away in tax breaks, it will
be gone forever. And if the economy sags, we will be back to huge
deficits. Risking that is really stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, lecturing vacationers won't make any difference.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody professes to desire a compromise, in which the
president goes for a scaled-down, half-sized tax cut and the
Republicans grant some financial leeway for programs like Medicare
prescription drug benefits. Hardly anybody thinks that will happen.
It's too obviously sensible.
</P>
<P>
   Sensible is mushy politics. Confrontation is more useful in
election years.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay gave away the GOP game last week
when he conceded Republicans are passing bills that deliberately
siphon away nearly all the non-Social Security surplus on tax cuts,
leaving Clinton no money for his own priorities without raiding
Social Security. The idea is to then argue that Clinton's spending
plans threaten the elderly's retirement lifeline, not the GOP tax
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans don't want a legislative record, they want
issues on which to campaign in year 2000. It is less clear what the
Democrats want, but they wouldn't mind pointing fingers instead of
counting achievements, either.
</P>
<P>
   The likely outcome is that neither side will compromise, Clinton
will veto as promised, and the world will go on. The GOP learned
its lesson in previous budget confrontations; Congress will duck
rather than let the government be shut down again by a mindless
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   Under an accounting gimmick, Congress can continue to operate on
last year's budget levels, in effect stalling until the next
election changes the political equation. Program allocations and
tax status will remain the same. No progress will be made but no
damage done either.
</P>
<P>
   Not a great solution. But everyone can live with it. So enjoy
your vacation.

 &HT;    TALL TALES &AMP; SHORT STORIES: Of communistss and happy meals
 &HT;    (Eds: Sixth in a series. Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
reported from Eastern Europe during a visit 10 years ago, just
before the fall of the Berlin Wall. This summer he returned to
write about the changes that have led three former Eastern Bloc
countries _ Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland _ to become the
newest members of NATO. At the end of the series, CoxNet will
compile these columns into our weekly Focus page, good for running
as a Perspective-type page or op-ed feature.

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE - Last time I dined at the Hotel Europa, they begged me
to return soon.
</P>
<P>
   That was ten years ago. The people of Prague, still very much in
the grip of the communist regime, were strapped for hard currency,
and I was paying with dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Another journalist and I had been the restaurant's only
customers on that misty fall night in 1989. The hotel's string
quartet played just for us as we sampled vintage wine that, I like
to think, the Hotel Europa had stashed from the communists for a
special occasion. It was as wonderful a dinner as I ever remember.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel, on Wenceslas Square since 1889, nowadays is so busy
that I had to make three return trips before the head waiter could
take time out to talk with me.
</P>
<P>
   Its rising popularity is due somewhat to that of the movie,
``Titanic.'' The dining room, awash in Old World elegance and
crowned with a lavish turn-of-the-century skylight of leaded glass,
could have been a set from the film. It's worth eating here just to
be here.
</P>
<P>
   My friend the head waiter, Peter Boochaz, now 36, was likewise
here ten years ago. Then he was part of the kitchen help, just
starting out. Neither of us remembered the other, but no matter. We
had been there together, that much we were sure of.
</P>
<P>
   A different time, it was. And yet...
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have changed, but in some ways not so different,'' he
said. ``What you still remember is still with you.''
</P>
<P>
   It's still with him.
</P>
<P>
   He asked that I not use a tape recorder for our interview. ``It
reminds me too much of the interrogations.''
</P>
<P>
   Press him on that topic, and he won't talk even for note-taking.
``I never did anything,'' he said, dismissing the subject with a
wave of his hand and the billowing smoke from a constant cigarette.
``It's nothing worth talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   You could easily imagine Boochaz in a spy role, more so for the
movies. He's that handsome - tall, dark and dimpled _ and with an
accent reminiscent of Charles Boyer.
</P>
<P>
   He has a wife and three children, the oldest by an earlier
marriage. He blames himself for the failure of his first marriage.
After the fall of communism, when the free market economy seemed to
promise everything for everybody, he said he gave himself too much
to his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I needed was a 48-hour day - 46 1/2 hours for work, one
hour for sex and a half hour for whatever else.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is success to be had under capitalism, but not
enough to go around to everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have our rich, and we have our poor, but the middle
class does not exist.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be up to the next generation to change that, he said,
``or maybe the next two or three generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everything he sees is changing for the better.
</P>
<P>
   The Czech Republic, as a new member of NATO, signed on to the
war in Kosovo. But not him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like war, not the Cold War, not the war in Kosovo,''
he said. ``Kosovo involved a struggle of religions. I like all
religions.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say he doesn't like the U.S. - leastwise he'd like
to know more about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But not just to know how to make money. Money is only paper.
I'd like to hike your forests, to ski your mountains, to know and
experience the beauty of your country.''
</P>
<P>
   That's nothing new, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Czech people, even when our borders were closed, our
mind-set was always with the West.''
</P>
<P>
   As for what has changed ...
</P>
<P>
   I hope not the food, I told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, the food is still wonderful,'' he said warmly.
</P>
<P>
   Then he stopped, frowned and shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take that back,'' he said. ``For Prague, the food has
changed. Now we have McDonald's.''

UNDATED: statesman Adlai Stevenson. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's mark 1900 as the strategic turning point for the destiny
of the vice presidency. Renomination was a foregone conclusion for
William McKinley, the popular incumbent reckoned as unbeatable. But
party bosses speculating on the GOP's long-range future believed it
necessary to neutralize one Theodore Roosevelt, the 42-year-old
Rough Rider legend of the Spanish-American War.
</P>
<P>
   They put Teddy on the ticket with McKinley and supposed he was
defused. Instead, TR became president when McKinley was
assassinated, barely into his second term. By his remarkable energy
and undoubted charisma, the first of the Presidents Roosevelt
dominated the Republican Party as handily as he controlled
Congress. In 1904 he was the first vice president since Van Buren
to be elected in his own right.
</P>
<P>
   William Howard Taft, all 300 pounds of him, was Roosevelt's
personal choice to succeed him, and he waltzed to victory in the
1908 election. But because Roosevelt couldn't control Taft, the two
parted ways, and TR ran as a third-party ``Bull Moose'' Progressive
in 1912, causing the split that threw the election to the
Democrats' Woodrow Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   However, Theodore Roosevelt merely was the exception to prove
the rule for vice presidential substance. Wilson's veep, Thomas
Marshall, is immortalized for having declared, ``What this country
needs is a good five-cent cigar.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles G. Dawes, Calvin Coolidge's vice president, is
remembered mainly as a songwriter _ ``Many a tear has to fall, but
`It's All in the Game.''' And Harry Truman's beloved veep, Alben
Barkley, was a venerable statesman in the Curtis-Garner mold.
</P>
<P>
   Coolidge himself had been a strategic afterthought, a New
Englander to balance a ticket led by Ohio's Warren Gamaliel
Harding. The sudden death of Harding in 1923 catapulted Coolidge
into the presidency; and unprecedented prosperity not of his own
doing catapulted Coolidge into unprecedented popularity. After his
election with Dawes in 1924, he did not choose to run in '28. Had
he so chosen, he could not have lost, regardless of who might have
been identified as his second banana.
</P>
<P>
   It was rather a different story in 1944. FDR was the Democrats'
``indispensable man'' seeking a fourth term, and most in the
party's inner sanctum sensed his impending death. They engineered
to have Harry Truman become FDR's third vice president (following
Garner and Henry Wallace) in the certain belief that Truman would
become our 33rd president.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since then, the vice presidency has had considerable
political clout. In 1952 Dwight Eisenhower chose as his running
mate a rising star, Richard Nixon, then only 39; and most vice
presidents since Nixon have had their party's nomination for the
presidency: Nixon; Lyndon Johnson; Hubert Humphrey; Gerald Ford;
Walter Mondale; George Bush ... and don't bet against Al Gore. (The
only exceptions have been the Nixon tandem of Spiro Agnew and
Nelson Rockefeller, and Bush's curiously chosen Dan Quayle.)
</P>
<P>
   Relationships between presidents and their first lieutenants
also have changed remarkably. During the eight years that he was
vice president, John Garner saw FDR a total of nine times and
visited with him ``twice. Harry Truman revealed in his memoirs that
when he was suddenly whisked into the presidency, he had seen
little of FDR and had not been briefed on any matters of policy.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, Johnson, Bush, Gore _ all have been strategically
involved in affairs of state. So now the vice presidency isn't a
banishment _ it's a steppingstone worth several gallons of spit,
warm or otherwise.

THE NO. 2 SPOT: TODAY'S VICE PRESIDENCY ISN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Nance Garner, constrained by the office during Franklin D.
Roosevelt's first two terms, later described the vice presidency as
``not worth a pitcher of warm spit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cactus Jack,'' from Uvalde, Texas, was speaker of the U.S.
House of Representatives when he was Texas' ``favorite son'' choice
for the presidential nod at the 1932 Democratic convention. Jim
Farley, architect for FDR's successful quest for the nomination,
engineered the deal that put the raffish, delightfully crude Garner
on the ticket with the patrician Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Rightly or wrongly, most Americans blamed President Herbert
Hoover for the Great Depression, so in the general election the
Democrats rode roughshod over the GOP ticket of Hoover and the
incumbent vice president, sweet old Charles Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   Their party affiliations notwithstanding, Garner and Curtis were
longtime close friends. When the government changed hands, Curtis
said: ``Jack, your career is over now. They're putting you out to
pasture, as they did me.''
</P>
<P>
   That was how it used to be with the vice presidency. Not any
more.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a formidable charge by Bill Bradley or some other
development not presently foreseeable, Al Gore will be the
Democratic standard bearer for the national election in 2000. This
illustrates vividly how the vice presidency has been upgraded in
very recent times.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president may often be a ribbon-cutting stand-in for
the chief executive, but he (or she) still has almost no official
responsibility beyond presiding over the Senate. But nowadays the
veeps are younger than before and are keenly identified with their
administrations.
</P>
<P>
   John Adams was vice president to George Washington; and when
Adams became our second president, his vice president was a
political antagonist _ Thomas Jefferson, no less. It was during
Jefferson's tenure as our third president that a two-party system
became sharply defined, and the vice presidency lost its luster.
</P>
<P>
   Only once in the 19th century did a vice president graduate to
the top spot via a national election. That was in 1836, when Martin
Van Buren was essentially a puppet, representing the continuity of
Andrew Jackson's Democratic administration when Jackson honored
George Washington's precedent by not seeking a third term.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Van Buren's own re-election bid was derailed
by the fabled Whig tandem of ``Tippecanoe and Tyler too,'' but with
ironic result. Tippecanoe was William Henry Harrison, military hero
of the early Indian wars; and John Tyler was no Whig at all, but a
Democrat opposed to the Jackson-Van Buren governmental style. Tyler
was also a Virginian, imparting geographic balance to the ticket
led by Indiana's Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   Taking office at age 68, Harrison died after only one month in
office, all of it spent in bed. He signed no legislation, so Tyler
in effect had a complete term as president. He was also a vigorous
chief executive who played a decisive role in the annexation of
Texas. Yet not in four years could he gain control of the Whig
machinery, and he was denied nomination in 1844.
</P>
<P>
   The second president to die in office was Zachary Taylor, also a
Whig, also a military hero (Mexican War). The 1850 death of ``Old
Rough and Ready'' opened the presidency to Millard Fillmore, a
formidable candidate for the title of our worst president ever.
Fillmore sought to retain the presidency but also was sent packing
by the Whig hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Whigs in 1852 trotted out yet another vaunted
soldier; and when Winfield Scott was swamped by Democrat Franklin
Pierce, the Whigs were finished ... but were reconstituted soon
after, more spectacularly, as the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Lincoln in 1860 became the first Republican elected to
the presidency. The Civil War was still unresolved when Lincoln's
re-election bid four years later proposed a new vice president. The
presence on the ticket of Tennessee's Andrew Johnson, a former
Democrat, may well have swung a close election to the Republicans;
but in the wake of Lincoln's assassination, the party gave Johnson
nothing but trouble. He was a lame-duck president both before and
after he barely survived impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The 1880 election delivered an impressive young Republican to
the White House; but less than a year later, James Garfield was
dead at age 49, assassinated by a disappointed office-seeker.
Ascending to the presidency was Chester Alan Arthur, a party
regular and a man of considerable charm. Arthur avoided controversy
and appeared to have control of the GOP machinery, but he too was
unable to secure nomination in his own right, yielding the bid to
James G. Blaine, characterized by the Democrats as ``the
continental liar from the state of Maine.''
</P>
<P>
   The generals of party politics appeared not to have learned a
lesson from history. Both the Democrats and the Republicans
continued to designate benign elders as vice presidential fodder.
They all seemed to resemble the first Adlai Stevenson, who was one
of Grover Cleveland's veeps and was great-grandfather to the
20th-century statesman Adlai Stevenson.

   TRADERMAIN _ ATLANTA _ In another time and another place, Mark
Barton might have been a high-stakes gambler who spent his days _
and money _ at the horse track or the craps tables. But his
addiction was a more modern one, born of the high-tech age. He
plunked down huge bets not on long-shot nags but on a long-shot
method for trading stocks, devised for bold, rich and naive
speculators. And suckers. He was one of a few thousand Americans to
embark on a ``career'' in online trading _ in his case day trading,
a financially dangerous pursuit that may sound more legitimate than
betting on horses, but in reality is much the same. So were his
results. On Monday, the North American Securities Administrators
Association, which represents stock regulators in every state,
called for a stiff crackdown on day trading to protect people like
Barton from losing their shirts in a game in which they have little
chance of winning. (Hendricks, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   w/ TRADER-ONLINE _ ATLANTA _ An estimated 6,000 people trade

   TRADERS _ ATLANTA _State securities regulators are expected to

industry. (Glass, Cox News Service)

   TRADERMAIN _ ATLANTA _ In another time and another place, Mark
Barton might have been a high-stakes gambler who spent his days _

addiction was a more modern one, born of the high-tech age. He
plunked down huge bets not on long-shot nags but on a long-shot
method for trading stocks, devised for bold, rich and naive
speculators. And suckers. He was one of a few thousand Americans to
embark on a ``career'' in online trading _ in his case day trading,
a financially dangerous pursuit that may sound more legitimate than

CONSUMERS FED UP WITH WARNINGS
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Wednesday, Aug. 11.)

<P>
   In Washington last week a panel of 20 prominent researchers and
scientists announced that they will no longer be warning Americans
about anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're done. It's over. That's it,'' said professor Sigmund
Tofu, a man who has spent the past 10 years trying to explain to
Americans the difference between ``good'' and ``bad'' cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're tired of being jeered and mocked by people every time we
revise our opinion on an important health issue,'' said Dr. Beavis
Fenfen, author of the ground-breaking report ``Eat More Eggs Until
You Die.''
</P>
<P>
   In a press release, the panel presented the results of a poll
that showed that 60 percent of Americans think food warnings are
``a bunch of hooey'' and 80 percent believe that scientists will
someday come to the conclusion that a diet of cheese nachos and
butter-pecan ice cream is good for the heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you people are waiting for us to say that three Big Macs a
day will improve your cardiovascular fitness, then you're in for a
long wait,'' said Dr. Mitral Endoscopy. ``However, we are seeing
evidence that a quart or more a day of Secret Sauce can lower the
risk of bladder cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that only 20 percent of Americans heed health
warnings today compared to 71 percent 25 years ago. Forty percent
of Americans say they avert their eyes when they come across a new
health warning in their daily newspaper and 12 percent admitted
that they threw a heavy object at their TV screen when it was
announced recently that margarine may be bad for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``You people seem to think we're making this stuff up as we go
just to jerk you around,'' said professor O.K. Transfatti. ``That
is simply not true but just to be on the safe side, we have applied
for a $200 million federal grant to study the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Public annoyance with new research findings found its focus last
year with the creation of Citizens Riled Over Contradictions
(CROC), a group of citizens that claims that scientists have made
it impossible for a person to lead a healthy life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a question of guilt,'' said CROC organizer I.B.
Shrill. ``We're used to guilt. We've lived with guilt all our
lives. In the old days, if we ate an egg, we felt guilty. If we
shook a few grains of salt on our salad, we felt guilty. If a drop
of alcohol touched our lips, we felt guilty. That was OK. At least
we knew what we were supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now, all bets are off. Nobody knows what's right and wrong
anymore. You know what I had for dinner last night? A salted,
hard-boiled egg and a glass of red wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago that was the dietary equivalent of jumping off a
cliff. Today, it's a healthy meal. Tomorrow? Who knows? Some
pencil-necked geek in a lab somewhere might discover that broccoli
causes cancer in laboratory rats, if they eat the equivalent of 20
pounds a day of the stuff over 5 years, but 30 hot dogs a day
improves the memory, though I don't know what you'd be remembering,
other than the fact it's time to eat another hot dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really care what scientists tell us to do. If they
want us to eat salmon until we swim upriver and spawn, great. If
they want us to guzzle eight glasses of olive oil a day, that's
fine, too. Just tell us what to do and stick with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't tell us a year later or 10 years later that a grilled
salmon steak brushed with olive oil will make my skin peel off and
my liver turn green. I don't want to hear it. I can't spend the
rest of my life worrying about whether peanut butter is good for me
or the next best thing to swallowing cyanide.
</P>
<P>
   ``CROC is glad to hear that scientists will no longer be issuing
any warnings of any kind because, quite frankly, we're tired of
listening.''

SPEED, POWER AND THE LITTLE RACE THAT ROARS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SONOMA, Calif. _ They drove me over to the waiver trailer. A
nice lady handed me a piece of paper, which she asked me to sign.
It said I would not hold the National Hot Rod Association, Sears
Point Raceway and their heirs responsible if a drag racer blew up
in my vicinity, sending shrapnel-like pieces of metal into my
spleen, liver, frontal lobes, etc.
</P>
<P>
   I signed.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for my signature, I was taken in a golf cart to the
starting line for the NHRA Autolite Nationals, held Sunday at Sears
Point. The starting line is a narrow strip of concrete filled with
fumes. I stood between two top-fuel vehicles, about two feet away
from each one. They are basically rockets on wheels. It was like
standing on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral.
</P>
<P>
   I was feeling pretty excited, until David Lamm, who handles
media relations for the NHRA, said, ``This is louder than Van
Halen. If you're around these cars long enough they will damage
your hearing even if you wear earplugs. The sound will penetrate
your cranium.''
</P>
<P>
   I had visions of sound waves invading my skull and erasing my
memory bank.
</P>
<P>
   The cars began revving their engines. I was wearing earplugs,
but I felt my cranium begin to vibrate and my brain turning to
pudding. My ears hurt. I remembered something else Lamm had said.
``They're going to hit the throttle and you're going to feel like
you're going to die.''
</P>
<P>
   A pleasant thought.
</P>
<P>
   He also said, ``It'll vibrate your organs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Which ones?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of them,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers were getting ready to compete in the first round of
eliminations. They were looking at a set of lights called the
Christmas tree which count down to the start _ a bunch of amber
lights, then green. The Christmas tree turned green. The cars took
off. The word loud does not begin to describe it. The world turned
into a roar which was outside me and inside me. And there was
nothing else but the roar, except for my small intestine doing the
hula.
</P>
<P>
   I blinked, and when I looked up the cars were flying far down
the track in a haze. The Earth seemed to slide. Suddenly their
parachutes had deployed. That was it. The end.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Vandergriff, the winner, had gone a quarter of a mile in 4.5
seconds, reaching a top speed of 317 mph. The loser, Garth
Widdison, couldn't manage anything in excess of 276 mph. Slowpoke.
</P>
<P>
   All over my face I found tiny specks of black, the result of
flying tire rubber. The remnants of nitromethane fuel hung in the
air in a gray haze. Nitromethane is the result of a chemical
reaction between nitric acid and propane. Don't use that stuff in
your Honda.
</P>
<P>
   A little later, they had eliminations in the Funny Car division.
You expected clowns from Barnum &AMP; Bailey to tool around the track
in old VW bugs. Forget that. Funny cars go just as fast as top-fuel
cars. They have the same engines, which generate 6,000 horsepower
and they are just as loud. It's just that they look like stock
cars, and the engine is front-mounted, and the entire body lifts up
from the front.
</P>
<P>
   John Force, the Jeff Gordon of drag racing, was going against
Chuck Beal, a 56-year-old engineer who works 40 hours a week in a
think tank in San Diego. Risking his life in a funny car is Beal's
weekend hobby. He prefers that to something safer, like knitting.
</P>
<P>
   The Christmas tree flashed green. The earth roared. They took
off. Right away, Force spun his tires. That problem was nothing
compared with what happened to Beal. The body of his car burst into
flame and disintegrated before everyone's startled eyes. At the
end, he was driving a convertible _ an exposed chassis and a
steering wheel, to be precise.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow Beal won. Don't ask me how. And afterward Beal tried to
explain the thrill of navigating all that power and speed for one
quarter of a mile. ``Stepping on the pedal,'' he said, ``is like
stepping on a stick of dynamite.''
</P>
<P>
   Sign me up.
</P>
<P>
   This is how Force described the feeling of hurtling down the
track: ``I like the car bouncing around. I like hitting the
throttle and knowing all hell can break loose. I like getting from
A to B when fire breaks out, and going through all the reactions
that are right.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, who wouldn't like that, especially the part about the
burning cockpit? Oh by the way, Force refuses to breathe during the
race. Why? It's something about not inhaling flames if the car gets
torched.
</P>
<P>
   So, why are fans interested in dragsters? Sears Point doesn't
release attendance figures, but the grandstands were filled on
Sunday, spectators spilling onto the scorched hills above the
track.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say this. Americans are obsessed with speed and power _
with Roger Clemens' 100-mph heat, with Mike Tyson's right-hand
knockout punch, with Terrell Davis busting through the line for a
touchdown. But none of this approaches top-fuel drag racing, guided
missiles blasting down the track in the most direct, uncomplicated
demonstration of power and speed in sports.
</P>
<P>
   They say baseball expresses the soul of America. Maybe it does
and maybe it doesn't. But one thing is pretty obvious. You didn't
have to look far to find America's soul on Sunday. It was at Sears
Point. And it roared.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In new observations of the outer solar system, two telescopes in
Hawaii have seen beyond previous limits of visibility to make
intriguing discoveries about the surface composition of the planet
Pluto and Saturn's largest satellite, Titan.
</P>
<P>
   One telescope revealed the existence of the hydrocarbon ethane
on Pluto's surface. The discovery is potentially significant
because the ethane may be a remnant component of the original
interstellar gas cloud that collapsed to form the solar system 4.5
billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Another telescope detected what may be liquid or frozen seas of
hydrocarbons on Titan. If these are indeed seas, they would be the
only ones known in the solar system other than those on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The Pluto observations were conducted by astronomers using
Japan's new Subaru Telescope, at the summit of Mauna Kea on the
island of Hawaii. The pictures were taken with an infrared camera
designed to study the light from objects to determine their
chemical composition and other characteristics. They were among the
first pictures that clearly separated Pluto from its satellite
Charon, which are only 12,200 miles apart, so close that their
images usually appear blurred together.
</P>
<P>
   Pluto is the most distant and smallest planet of the Sun, with a
diameter of 1,413 miles. Charon (pronounced KAIR-on) was not
discovered until 1978. Its diameter of 728 miles, about half the
size of Pluto, is unusually large for a satellite to be in relation
to its planetary companion.
</P>
<P>
   The new observations not only confirmed that Pluto is covered in
frozen nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide; they also detected
light betraying the existence of ethane ice. Temperatures on
Pluto's surface are as low as minus 387 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   In an announcement of the findings, Dr. Ian Shelton, an
astronomer and spokesman for the Subaru Telescope, said that
further analysis of the data could determine if the ethane is
primordial material from which the solar system was formed. It may
have been preserved by the extreme cold at the fringes of the
planetary system. Alternatively, the ethane may have been created
since the beginning of the solar system by the reaction of
ultraviolet sunlight on primordial methane.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, astronomers said, a study of the ethane could
add to the skimpy knowledge about physical conditions on Pluto. For
one thing, the ethane apparently does not exist as individual
grains but is dissolved instead within the much more plentiful
nitrogen ice on Pluto's surface.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers confirmed that water ice covered much of the
satellite Charon's surface and is absent on Pluto; in fact, judging
by their distinctive light signatures, the two bodies have
completely different surface compositions. The astronomers said
this supported the hypothesis that the Pluto-Charon system formed
out of the shattered remains of a collision sometime early in the
solar system's history.
</P>
<P>
   The observations of Saturn's moon Titan were conducted at the
Keck Telescope, also on Mauna Kea, by astronomers from the
University of California at Berkeley and at Los Angeles, and at the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, in Livermore, Calif. The
results are published in the current issue of Icarus, a journal for
planetary sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Titan is one of the largest moons, larger than the planet
Mercury, and the only body in the solar system with a nitrogen-rich
atmosphere like Earth's. A dense smog fills Titan's sky and
obscures the surface. But by taking hundreds of infrared
``snapshots'' and merging them through computer processing,
astronomers at Keck were able to map surface features 150 miles in
size.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the extremely dark regions, astronomers said, could be
vast pools of hydrocarbons. For a long time, scientists have
speculated that ethane smog could condense and rain onto Titan's
surface as a black liquid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dark material could be a sea of liquid methane, ethane or
other hydrocarbons,'' said Dr. Bruce Macintosh, a Livermore
astrophysicist. ``It's one of the darkest things in the solar
system. It could also be solid organic material.''
</P>
<P>
   Seas or not, the dark regions suggest the existence of complex
organic chemical processes on Titan that make the huge moon
resemble the pre-biotic Earth more than any other place in the
solar system, the scientists concluded. They expect more definitive
answers in 2004, when the American-European spacecraft Cassini is
supposed to reach Saturn and send a probe to the surface of Titan,
solid or liquid.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At 4 p.m. Monday, the temperature at Raleigh, N.C., registered
81 degrees. This marks the first time in the last 23 days that the
temperature failed to reach 90 degrees or higher. Readings will
once again stay below 90 degrees across North Carolina and the rest
of the Middle Atlantic states Tuesday as somewhat cooler breezes
filter into the region behind a departing cold front.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, oppressive heat and humidity will continue to grip
much of the interior Southeast as ample sunshine propels
temperatures well into the 90s. An exception will occur near the
Gulf Coast and northern Florida where a high-altitude disturbance
causes clouds and scattered thunderstorms. Elsewhere, searing heat
will continue to plague much of Texas and the Plains as a warm
high-pressure system persists across the region.
</P>
<P>
   A northward surge of humid air will fuel a cluster of showers
and thunderstorms across the central Great Lakes on Tuesday
morning. Later in the day, the showers and storms will affect
northern Ohio and Pennsylvania as well as upstate New York.
Scattered strong thunderstorms will also erupt Tuesday afternoon
from southern Michigan to Indiana as an approaching cold front
lifts sultry air covering the region.
</P>
<P>
   An unusually potent jet stream disturbance will spiral into
California and Nevada on Tuesday, setting the stage for a few
potent thunderstorms, especially near the Sierra mountains. Uneven
heating of the varied terrain will also spark isolated
thunderstorms across the southern Rockies. The Northwest will be
mainly dry and warmer than recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Cool Change
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of a cold front on Monday, intermittent rain fell
from a leaden sky as a period of exceptional heat ended in Raleigh,
N.C. A string of 23 consecutive days with temperatures above 90
degrees was broken as readings remained in the 70s most of the day.
Raleigh's record of 24 days with maximums above 90 set in 1955
remains standing. However, the siege of heat left its legacy. On
Sunday, the temperature reached 101, marking the 11th time this
year that the mercury reached or exceeded the century plateau, a
new record for frequency of extreme heat in Raleigh.

FAMILY REUNION ABROAD  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 15) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARGOT SLADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the age range that almost did us in. For the fifth year
in a row, my husband and I were planning an extended-family
holiday. But through marriage, mating and the passage of time, our
British (his) and American (mine) combined family of Baxters and
Slades was 19 strong. It extended from 8-week- and 10-week-old
cousins, toddlers and adolescent nieces to Granddad, my
father-in-law, age 80.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not alone,'' said Andrew Norman, with classic British
understatement. ``Your numbers and ages may, er, present a bit of a
challenge.'' (A bit?) ``But lots of intergenerational families are
currently taking holidays together. And with the proper
arrangements, they do rather well.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, arrangements. Norman was familiar with those. When we
met up with him last year, he was the director of Portledge Estate,
a collection of seven rental cottages set on 1,900 acres on
England's North Devon coast. Children-of-Merlin is what we
christened his staff after they conjured up 25 bath towels and a
second hair dryer (remember the teen-aged girls?) within minutes of
our arrival.
</P>
<P>
   He was right about both the family phenomenon and the
prerequisite for success. In the United States and in Britain,
families have taken to the notion of multigenerational gatherings
with zest. ``Often, grandparents will rent an easily accessible
house and have different children and grandchildren staying for a
week at a time,'' said Jenni L. Blower, the estate's new
administrator.
</P>
<P>
   The variations are many, but certain planning and operational
rules can be established _ that is, if you want to minimize what
Mrs. Blower calls ``aggro'' and end your vacation with everyone on
good speaking terms. Every time we bring our family together, we've
been taught new lessons while modifying the old. Here's what we've
learned thus far.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 1. The priority is seeing one another, not the countryside
or tourist sites.
</P>
<P>
   Only those who are like-minded should come. Willingness to
compromise makes planning a family gathering possible. While each
person's essential _ even idiosyncratic _ needs must be met, the
obligation to accommodate individuals ends there.
</P>
<P>
   My teen-aged nieces, Jenna and Ashley, were positively eloquent
regarding Rule 1. True, they said, gathering as a family means
never fully experiencing a country's cultural offerings.
(Translation: You can't shop 'til you drop or pretend that you are
independently wealthy orphans and hang with friends.)
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast and supper are generally eaten at home, and your free
time is circumscribed by an unwritten commitment to be with family.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, you get to see literally distant relatives.
Because our family members come from around the world _ three
brothers-in-law are in the British army _ my nieces felt that a
geography, current events and history lesson was served at every
meal. And though high culture may be beyond reach, everyday
activities, like food shopping, become adventures.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 2. Someone must be in charge, and that someone must
delegate tasks.
</P>
<P>
   In charge does not mean dictator _ as if you could dictate to
grown children or parents. We think of the job as combination
coordinator, clearinghouse, interlocutor and gentle goad. This is
the person who conducts an initial poll to determine who is
interested in vacationing together, when the best times are, how
far people can travel and how much they can spend.
</P>
<P>
   This person then assigns to others the task of finding the place
to stay, and of tracking and insuring payment of expenses. But it
is the person in charge who will seal the deal on the house or
hotel, and will be the keeper of information regarding arrival and
departure dates, telephone numbers and contact names, rental
spaces, rental cars and the like.
</P>
<P>
   My brother-in-law, Philip, and I co-managed the first gathering
five years ago: Philip, because we were assembling in Cyprus, where
he was stationed; me, because the American contingent would arrive
and leave in waves. Since then, other relatives have voluntarily
guided the process.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 3. Be honest about what you can afford in time and
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the clan together means selecting a date and place that
can accommodate the largest number for the smallest budget. Our
poll requires family members to list three possible vacation dates
along with travel time limitations: no more than five hours'
driving, for example, or six hours by air.
</P>
<P>
   As two separate amounts, they note how much they can spend
getting and staying there, wherever ``there'' is. Embarrassment has
no place if you want a vacation that is well attended and
resentment-free. Cyprus, for example, was an island too far, too
hot and too pricey for my sister and her brood.
</P>
<P>
   In pinpointing dates, consider these field-tested findings: Two
weeks is the maximum vacation time that members of our family can
afford; not every family unit or member will be able to stay the
full two weeks. The goal, then, is to pick the two-week period
during which the majority can stay for a time that overlaps with
others.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 4. In choosing the destination, let geography and finances
be your guide, but let common ground be your goal.
</P>
<P>
   The balance of geographic power shifts from year to year in our
family. When all three brothers-in-law were stationed in Germany,
Europe became the theater of operation. More discussion, with an
eye on a map of France, yielded several alternatives accessible
from international airports and through wine country. All offered
hiking, biking and swimming, with reasonably priced lodging and
campsites.
</P>
<P>
   Annecy and its neighbor, Bluffy, some 40 miles from Switzerland
on the eastern edge of the Haute Savoie, won when my father-in-law
(Rule 2: Delegate) found Auberge des Dents de Lanfon (the teeth
being that of a local mountain). Its seven double rooms cost $26 to
$29 a night at the time, and there was an area nearby where we
could park a camper and pitch a tent. We would shop in local
markets and picnic, or grab simple restaurant meals.
</P>
<P>
   The grandparents, who have stayed in better and stumbled on
worse, judged the auberge, with the owners Daniele Durey on
reception and her husband Jean-Marc as chef, a delight.
</P>
<P>
   When Jonathan, my youngest brother-in-law, and his family were
stationed in Canada two years ago, they tipped the scales to North
America _ specifically, to Prince Edward Island.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan scouted for rental cottages, the perfect arrangement
for families with children who need the freedom that hotels cannot
provide. The local tourist authority yielded Dunstaffnage Heights,
an old house with six bedrooms a few miles from the beach. The
total cost _ $612 for a week (now up to $750, with the current
exchange rate of $1.5 Canadian to the dollar).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the geographic balance shifted to Britain, with all
my brothers-in-law based in Wiltshire, near Salisbury, or London.
Everything hinged on the American contingent, since we would have
the longest trip at the greatest expense. We thought Cornwall. A
talk with our travel agent and friends sent us up the coast to less
crowded, and equally beautiful, North Devon.
</P>
<P>
   We could take a direct flight ($400 round trip) to Gatwick or
Heathrow. We could get a terrific two-week rental car deal ($394,
including tax and unlimited mileage), and the 150-mile journey is
simple to complete: take highways for speed and byways for scenic
stops, like Stonehenge.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 5. In selecting a home base, try to meet each family
member's minimal needs.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy is the priority for the Baxter grandparents, who need a
refuge from very active grandchildren. The Slade grandparents want
places to visit within an hour's drive, a time and distance they
can manage by themselves. My sister wants a pool (she's a serious
lap swimmer), a computer and a comfortable place to sit and read.
But then she's the single parent of teen-agers; enough said. The
teen-agers want to shop. Oh, and it's nice if they can ``like, uh,
do something, like, without, like uh, grown-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   We parents of young children have a number of needs:
</P>
<P>
   _ A house relatively easy to childproof.
</P>
<P>
   _ Access to a doctor in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   _ A secure yard where children can play when they awaken at 6:30
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ Amusements (in the summer, a playground, a beach, a swimming
pool and the like) within a 20-minute walk or drive.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rainy day activities reasonably close.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the places we have assembled, Portledge Estate remains
the best fit. First, there is the location _ four miles from
Bideford, a working riverside community with a small fishing fleet
(guaranteed entertainment for children). On its outskirts are a
supermarket, a garage and a gas station, and what the British call
a ``leisure center,'' with a heated indoor swimming pool, toddler
pool, exercise rooms and machines.
</P>
<P>
   Within easy travel distance of the estate is the larger town of
Barnstaple and several worth-a-detour sites, like Exeter and the
cliffside fishing village of Clovelly. Portledge itself offers
tennis (there is one court), hiking, fishing and a working farm
with enough sheep and cattle to entrance children for hours.
</P>
<P>
   True, the drive to town includes a stunningly narrow lane. But
shortcomings are more than compensated for by the likes of
Bideford's brass band, whose members serenade passers-by at night.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 6. The house must be inviting and a good base of
operations.
</P>
<P>
   For all our walking, swimming, sunning or sightseeing, everyone
in the family spends time at the house. We've tried hotels, but our
numbers mean that we virtually overrun any place that dares to take
us in. A rental gives everyone the freedom to roam, raise a racket
or raid the icebox.
</P>
<P>
   The rental should be attractive, with central heating, hot water
for our small army, a telephone, a washing machine and bedrooms
enough for children (who are grouped by age) and grown-ups (who are
not).
</P>
<P>
   On Portledge Estate, we rented Glendale Farmhouse (with four
bedrooms, three and a half bathrooms, a sitting room, dining room
and kitchen/breakfast room) and Glendale Cottage (with a bedroom
for the toddlers and one for each of two couples with infants, one
bathroom, a sitting room, dining room and kitchen) next door. We
brought linens, towels and kitchen extras. Pillows, duvets, spare
blankets and, yes, extra towels were provided.
</P>
<P>
   The cost may sound high: $1,170 for each of two weeks for the
farmhouse; $826 for the cottage for one week. (Prices include
electricity, oil and value added tax.) But divided on a pro-rated
basis, it was low: $546.25 for our foursome's two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Here is where we enter the world of extended-family vacation
mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 7. Appoint a chief accountant, who will record familywide
purchases (food or equipment everyone will use) and insure
equitable reimbursements.
</P>
<P>
   We divide the week's total by the number of adults and reimburse
the shoppers. It's best to arrange payment for rental houses and
rental cars beforehand; this guarantees that no one is stressed or
slighted.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 8. As goes food preparation, so goes the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   More friction is generated over food shopping and cooking than
almost anything else. It need not be that way. In reality, a
handful of people want to do the shopping: in our case, the two
grandmothers and my husband, who is a caterer. Let them. At the
house, we post a pad of paper, pencil attached, on which the rest
of us list what needs to be bought. Everyone goes on the first
foray, so that we all know where to find the supermarket, wine shop
and outdoor market.
</P>
<P>
   Couples take turns preparing supper. Washing up is grandmothers'
work _ or so the senior women of our clan let us know when they
shooed us out of the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 9. Don't try to plan anyone's vacation time other than your
own.
</P>
<P>
   Establish a central drop-off point _ like a hall table _ for car
keys and house keys. That is where family members can place
brochures about sites to see and notes about special events they've
discovered. Breakfast is when people announce their plans for the
day. Anyone who wants to can join in. Never try to cajole others
into participating. In anything.
</P>
<P>
   The evening meal gives people an opportunity to compare notes
and to regale listeners with accounts of their adventures. It is
the sweetest of moments. This is, after all, a family vacation.

 &HT;    Brown's much-hyped Talk walks the walk
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After making a splashy debut a week ago in New York, Talk
($2.95), Tina Brown's slick new magazine, has finally made its way
to the hinterlands. The first issues arrived in Atlanta over the
weekend and quickly sold out at several newsstands. In addition to
the much-hyped Hillary Rodham Clinton interview about her husband's
sex problems, Talk is crammed with fine writing by Martin Amis, Tom
Stoppard and others, and stunning _ and sexy _ photographs of
Gwyneth Paltrow posing for her ``dream roles'' as Barbarella and as
a leather bikini-clad dominatrix. One of the most compelling
articles is Eddie Dean's account of down-and-out life in a Virginia
trailer park, which begins this way: ``My new neighbor is naked
except for shorts and a 4-foot-long python around his thick, hairy
neck.'' Yes, the magazine has been overhyped, but it looks as if
Brown has another winner, just as she did at Vanity Fair and The
New Yorker. In the end, Talk is more than just talk.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rags to witches: Time ($3.50) critic Richard Zoglin traces the
history of cheapo horror flicks that made a bundle, while Newsweek
($3.50) speculates on the movie's impact on future Hollywood
projects. The verdict? Don't expect the big studios to start
turning out $35,000 films. Also of note: Former Atlanta journalist
Susan Faludi has written an insightful essay on the recent
workplace shootings in Atlanta and Pelham, Ala. The Pulitzer
Prize-winning author of ``Backlash: The Undeclared War Against
American Women'' blames such violent outbursts on men's changing
role in society. ``In an ornamental culture where worth is measured
by bicep and SUV size, by image and celebrity, men feel severed
from fellowship and a tangible craft, valued only for their stock
market portfolios.'' Faludi delves deeper into the subject in her
forthcoming book, ``Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The first 1,000 years: As we prepare for the next millennium,
U.S. News &AMP; World Report ($3.95) takes a look at what the world was
like in A.D. 1000. Apparently it was the best of times, it was the
worst of times. Europe was in the midst of the Dark Ages, but
Islamic civilizations enjoyed a high level of culture and
enlightenment. In daily life, canon law encouraged men to beat
their wives for their own good. Noble ladies, however, were allowed
to do the same to their servants. There was no lottery, but in the
Mississippi Valley, gamblers sometimes lost everything they owned
by betting on chunkey, a game in which participants threw spears at
a rolling stone.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Future trends: Assuming we survive Y2K, what can we expect in
the next millennium? Vibe ($3.99) took a peek in its crystal ball
to look at the people, places and things on the verge of changing
the world. Among the predictions: Philadelphia will be the next
hip-hop mecca, Starburst hard candy will be the next hot sweet
treat, stylists will use scalp stains to match your hair,
three-dimensional hologram swim goggles from Speedo will make pool
plunges more entertaining and companies will pay you to get tattoos
advertising their brands.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A smaller world: Thirty-six years ago, Lyndon Johnson said he
hoped the world would not ``narrow into a neighborhood before it
has broadened into a brotherhood.'' That was before cell phones,
the Internet and CNN. As National Geographic ($3) explains in its
August issue, the world's diverse cultures are in danger of
becoming homogenized. Nowadays it's not unusual to find men in
Shanghai who own a life-size Michael Jordan cutout or Californians
having henna designs applied to their hands. That's not necessarily
bad, says writer Erla Zwingle. ``Cultures don't become more
uniform; instead, both old and new tend to transform each other.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Changing styles: Glamour ($2.99) appears to be focusing less
on fashion and more on stories of substance. The September issue
features articles on the Norplant lawsuits and child protective
services that can virtually kidnap children and a poignant essay by
Kim Webdale, whose sister, Kendra, was pushed to her death on a New
York subway. But there's still plenty of celebrity fluff, including
the revelations that Mrs. Clinton once wanted to be an astronaut,
can swear like a sailor and was so naive in the 1970s that she
thought the tracking dogs in an Arkansas prison were inmates' pets.

 &HT;    Video store puttin' on the glitz for `Shakespeare'
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For never was a video of more glow than this of
Oscar-winner Gwyneth and her co-star Joe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love,'' the Gwyneth Paltrow-Joseph Fiennes date
movie that won seven Academy Awards, including best picture,
arrives in video stores today for rental. And it's getting the
royal treatment at the Ansley Mall (Atlanta) Blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   From 3:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. Thursday, Georgia Shakespeare
Festival actress Kathleen McManus will be at the store in full
regalia as Queen Elizabeth I for a trivia contest. Five other
actors from the Festival will perform scenes from ``Romeo and
Juliet,'' ``As You Like It,'' ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' and
``Henry V.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year we do something special for the movie that won all
the awards,'' says Hafeezah Mahdi, assistant manager at the Ansley
Blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   Many Blockbuster stores are stocking ``Shakespeare'' tapes in
``Titanic'' numbers. The Ansley store, for instance, is expecting
more than 180 copies of ``Shakespeare.'' That's about the same
number it got last year for Leonardo DiCaprio's watery weeper and
roughly 60 more than it received earlier this year for ``Saving
Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   While ``Shakespeare in Love'' is not yet priced to sell _ it
currently costs just over $100 to buy _ DVDs carry a suggested
price of $29.99. The latter includes the movie trailer.

 &HT;    Teens take over television: Do you care?
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're over 25 and still feel young, just wait till you get a
load of the new fall TV series. You'll feel like a major geezer.
</P>
<P>
   Popular culture, especially movies and music, has always focused
on youth. Top-selling recording artists? Kids. Biggest movie draws?
Young actors, many not actually kids themselves, who nevertheless
appeal to kids.
</P>
<P>
   Come fall, television joins the teeny-bopper brigade in a big
way. Of the 38 new series scheduled to debut on the six broadcast
networks, nearly half are about kids, teens and early
twentysomethings. The vast majority of them are specifically about
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   When ``thirtysomething'' came out a few years ago, it was a big
deal. These characters were considered young. Then came
``Friends,'' which lowered the popular age to 20s. Then they were
young; thirtysomethings were not. Now, with the success of WB hits
``Dawson's Creek,'' ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ``Felicity,''
there's a mad chase for teen actors and, presumably, teen viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Are teen-agers really that interesting? How many stories can
these super-young lives spawn? And is this narrow focus on teens,
the segment of the population least likely to watch TV, a good idea
business-wise for the sagging commercial networks?
</P>
<P>
   Viewers, ultimately, will decide by tuning in or not. In the
spirit of preseason optimism, however, industry experts
resoundingly answer yes, lots and you betcha to the aforementioned
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teen-agers have one foot firmly planted in childhood and the
other tentatively moving toward adulthood,'' said Robert Thompson,
director of Syracuse University's Center for the Study of Popular
Television. ``That's interesting in and of itself. And you've got
this nature-vs.-culture thing going on, too, in which biology is
telling kids one thing by the age of 12 or 13 and culture is
telling them something entirely different.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides dealing with raging hormones, teen-agers also are in the
process of breaking away emotionally from their parents and
declaring their independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that the ultimate American story?'' Thompson said.
``Teens and revolution are very nice metaphors. There's a lot of
dramatic stuff to be milled there. These kids are romantically
available, in the prime of their physical lives, discovering
themselves intellectually. I'm surprised it
</P>
<P>
   hasn't been tapped before.''
</P>
<P>
   WB, the fledgling network that saw its ratings take off like a
comet last season, has succeeded almost exclusively with teen
programming. Joining existing WB shows will be five new teen-themed
series. Fox, which started out as a youth-oriented network and then
matured a bit, returns to its teen roots in September with five new
teen-appeal shows. Fox's only real hit last season was the
teen-populated ``That '70s Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These new teen shows are filling a void,'' said Mike Greco,
manager of broadcast research for the New York advertising agency
BBDO. ``Besides the Friday teen shows on ABC, there aren't many
shows targeting teens on the Big Three. The WB, the No. 1 network
among teens, found a niche with shows that appeal to 12- to
34-year-olds. Fox did the same thing when it started out. It's a
smart strategy. I don't think ABC and NBC are abandoning their
18-49 audience. They're just trying to capitalize on the success of
other shows.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most promising new teen shows is NBC's hourlong
comedy-drama ``Freaks and Geeks,'' about an endearing group of
friends lurking on the fringe of the in-crowd in a Midwestern high
school in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always looking to keep our audience young,'' said
Shelley McCrory, senior vice president of prime-time development
for NBC. ``We don't want to give our teen audience away to the
smaller networks, but we can't survive with just teen-agers. We
have to reach huge numbers for our shows to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the high school shows that were pitched to us were
too narrow. We think `Freaks and Geeks' will appeal to teens and
young adults. It's relatable, and it's funny, not heavy-handed. We
want to paint a picture of high school that's realistic and makes
you laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   The slam on ABC's much-praised ``My So-Called Life'' a few years
ago was that it was too realistic. All that teen angst was
off-putting to many adults and reminded teen-agers just how
miserable their lives really were. NBC doesn't plan to make that
mistake with ``Freaks and Geeks,'' which leans heavily toward
``Wonder Years''-style sweetness and goofiness.
</P>
<P>
   But the series also must be careful to ring true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teens do have a radar that tells them when something is not
real,'' McCrory said. ``These characters are not overly glamorous.
It's not a soap.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a thinly-veiled slap at WB's ``Dawson's Creek,''
populated by teens so gorgeous and sexy there isn't one pimple or
crooked tooth among them. But maybe we shouldn't criticize TV for
its idealized portrayals. Almost every character on television,
with the possible exception of Dennis Franz on ``NYPD Blue,'' looks
much better than people in real life.
</P>
<P>
   Not that this is a peculiarly television problem. Movie stars
aren't exactly ugly. And how many Greeks and Romans even remotely
resembled the gorgeous paintings and statues that represented them?
Probably very few.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they're idealized,'' said Syracuse's Thompson. ``The
networks want people to sit down and enjoy this fantasy with these
incredible hunks and babes. But to succeed, these teen shows must
speak the way those people actually speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Teen lingo has permeated the larger culture for generations.
Phrases like ``far out,'' ``groovy'' and ``you know'' bubbled up
from American adolescents. It's, like, cool to talk young, ya know?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the time is ripe now for the teen invasion because network
television, which recently turned 50, is getting old. Cable is
young and fresh, but network TV is having a midlife crisis. New
shows fail at a breathtaking rate and even established hits like
``ER'' and ``Frasier'' have seen drastic audience declines.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 30 to 40 years of cops, doctors and lawyers, there's a
sense that TV has worn out those genres,'' Thompson said. ``We've
had so many brilliantly done legal dramas, especially in the past
decade, the question is, is there really that much to say? Sitcoms,
cop shows, lawyer shows and hospital shows are good, yeoman labor
in the field, but, really, it's all been done.''
</P>
<P>
   So here comes the teen army to save the day. Who will watch the
new shows? Teen-agers make up only a tiny segment of the TV
audience. They're too busy _ going to movies, playing video games,
renting videos, working on computers, dashing off to clubs and
sports practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teens are more fickle, and they're harder to pin down,'' said
NBC's McCrory. ``But finding young viewers is a priority because
we're looking to keep the next generation coming to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Conaway, a 13-year-old eighth-grader in Austin, Texas,
doesn't watch much TV during the week because he's busy doing
homework. Weekends don't see much TV time, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm usually out on the weekends,'' Conaway said. ``I don't
watch anything except maybe `Saturday Night Live.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Conaway, whose favorite show is the teen-less ``Simpsons,'' said
he might be more inclined to check out the new series this fall
because they're geared to teens. But he prefers comedies to
teen-angst dramas.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Kaufman, another Austinite, a 15-year-old high school
sophomore and dedicated gymnast, said she'd be more inclined to
watch the shows with teen-agers, too _ if she had time.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the week I go to school, go to the gym and then come
home and do my homework,'' Kaufman said. ``A lot of my friends have
to be home to watch certain shows, like `Dawson's Creek,' but I
just don't have time.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers have always salivated over 20- to 30-year-old
viewers. They're on their own and spending a good chunk of the
money they've just started earning. But teen-agers? You'd think
advertisers wouldn't care about them. The younger ones don't go out
unless somebody takes them, and most of the money they have comes
from parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason advertisers want teens is because teens are
setting up their loyalties to specific brands, and they're more
inclined to try new products,'' said Chris Geraci, vice president
for national TV buying for BBDO. ``For years Hollywood has listened
to the ad community say that younger demos are important, but older
demos watch TV, so it's a challenge to put something on that young
teens will watch. When they do, it's instantly appealing to
advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers of teen-favored products like movies, music and soft
drinks, are thrilled with the coming fall season, loaded as it is
with teen shows. According to Geraci, up-front ad sales have been
especially strong, stronger than last year, in fact, despite the
drop in overall ratings last season.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the biggest segment of the audience, viewers between 30
and 50, will find much of the teen-themed programming sophomoric.
And at least one network, CBS, has declined to join the teen parade
at all. Network President Leslie Moonves has repeatedly said his
network likes young viewers but prefers going after a mass
audience. That includes ``older folks'' in the 25-54 age range. Not
a bad plan.
</P>
<P>
   CBS finished first in overall ratings last season, with popular
shows such as ``Touched by an Angel'' and ``60 Minutes'' topping
the Nielsens. NBC was second in overall viewers but had more
programs, like ``ER'' and ``Friends,'' that appeal to the young
viewers advertisers covet. CBS seemingly is alone in its pursuit of
aging baby boomers and older viewers. The network doesn't have a
single teen show on its schedule for fall.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-teen contingency thinks the same aging boomer audience
will flock to teen-themed shows that are done well.
</P>
<P>
   ``As boomers reach their 40s and 50s, maybe we should not be
surprised if they turn from thirtysomething shows to
teensomething,'' Thompson said. ``It becomes kind of a bummer to
identify with older characters. I'm not sure people in their 80s
want to watch shows about people in their 80s, especially given the
narcissistic quality of boomers.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine a huge group of old folks tuning in to
``Freaks and Geeks,'' but anything's possible.
</P>
<P>
   Where will the youth trend end up? Will we have a merry band of
6- to 10-year-old kids leading the way in a couple of years? The
Big Three insist they have no grade-school ensemble shows on the
drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always gonna have cute kids on sitcoms, but in the end,
a 10- or 11-year-old just isn't very interesting, except to their
parents,'' Thompson said. ``I'd be shocked if next year we've got a
`Dawson's Creek Preschool.' ''

NEW ENGLAND AS SOOTHING MYTH FOR A NATION THAT WANTED ONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Think of American beginnings, and what comes to
mind? New England, probably, and with it a flood of associations.
Pious Pilgrims and feisty Minutemen. Yankee farmers and
Transcendentalist poets. Whaling ships and white-steepled churches
with ``their air of sparse, sincere rebellion,'' as the Boston-born
poet Robert Lowell put it.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, this New England never quite existed. For
generations, its history has been imaginatively enhanced and
sugarcoated by a nation in search of a foundation, by Americans
anxious for the solace of a reassuring past and by a tourist
industry in the business of selling dreams.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, is the idea put forth by ``Picturing Old New
England: Image and Memory,'' a revisionist think piece of an
exhibition, very 1990s in style, at the National Museum of American
Art through Aug. 22. Part art history and part sociology, it
proposes that Old New England was a fiction and that art helped to
invent it, turning a chunk of surveyable American soil into a
political symbol and a spiritual state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   The show has problems. It squeezes complex artists and expansive
ideas into a narrow thematic groove. And it is, on the whole, more
stimulating to read about than to look at. But many of its insights
are on target, and its topsy-turvy mix of highbrow and popular
culture _ Winslow Homer seascapes and ski resort posters, John
Singer Sargent portraits and faux-Colonial doilies _ is prickly and
smart.
</P>
<P>
   The period covered, from the end of the Civil War through World
War II, was one of traumatic change. An agrarian past gave way to
an industrial present. Science and religion came to mortal blows.
An Anglo-Saxon ruling elite was confronted by waves of immigrants
from southern and eastern Europe and by a population of former
slaves stranded by the failed Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the 19th century, the economy grew shaky.
Labor unrest spread fears of class war. The suicide rate shot up;
most cases were in the Northeast. George Miller Beard's ``American
Nervousness, Its Causes and Consequences,'' an 1881 study,
attributed the plague of mental breakdowns to social change. The
philosopher Charles Peirce referred to the Gilded Age as an ``Age
of Pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Where to turn for comfort and stability, for solid social ground
(including ethnic homogeneity) and intact moral values? The
exhibition's curators, William Truettner and Roger Stein, suggest
that many Americans, artists included, looked to a never-never-land
vision of Colonial New England, where the national saga began.
</P>
<P>
   The show opens with an early episode from that saga in the form
of George Henry Boughton's kitsch classic ``Pilgrims Going to
Church'' (1867). The painting depicts a party of plainly dressed
settlers filing through a woodland clearing in midwinter.
Vulnerable to Indian attack but armed with prayer books and guns,
they are emblems of courage and piety, imperiled but steadfast.
</P>
<P>
   Puritan probity heats up to don't-tread-on-me Yankee
belligerence in costume-drama illustrations of the Revolutionary
War. ``The Boston Boys and General Gage'' (1875), by Henry Bacon,
is one. Here, epicene redcoats (tight breeches, funny bouffant
helmets) are confronted by a delegation of local ragamuffins who
demand their right to play where they want, when they want, in this
case on the Boston Common.
</P>
<P>
   Boston may have been the Cradle of Liberty, but it was also an
intensely Anglophiliac town. (It still is.) In his portraits of
Back Bay blue bloods, Sargent emulated the 18th-century American
style of John Singleton Copley. But he added a dash of Continental
suavity and luxe to signal that his sitters were New World
nobility, republican in practice, Loyalists at heart, with unbroken
British cultural ties.
</P>
<P>
   Gentility mixed with native vigor is the recipe for much of the
work in the show. One finds it in Childe Hassam's
Impressionist-style paintings of Colonial doorways. It's there in
Daniel Chester French's dashing bronze ``Concord Minute Man''
(1875), modeled on the Apollo Belvedere. And it takes a
particularly daffy form in an 1890s armchair made from spinning
wheels, a nostalgic tribute to a craft that the New England textile
industry had rendered obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   With time, both the region and its image changed. As
Massachusetts grew urban and crowded, artists looked north. Winslow
Homer paved the way with his retreat to Maine, where he painted the
sea and speculated in real estate. George Bellows worked on
Monhegan Island; Rockwell Kent toughed out several winters there.
Marsden Hartley, a Maine native and a hectic, restless soul,
returned to the state repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   During the Depression, painters took the hard-pressed lives of
farmers and fishermen as subjects, as in N.C. Wyeth's ``Island
Funeral'' (1939), with its omniscient, fisheye-lens Emersonian view
of life and death, sea and sky. Yet even Social Realism, a
``people's'' art, was scrupulously edited: Little trace of a
racially mixed, technologically advanced, ideologically dynamic
American society _ the one that actually existed _ finds mention
here.
</P>
<P>
   Even the more adventurous modern artists seem in thrall to the
New England spell. The factories in Charles Sheeler's paintings are
color-coordinated and immaculate. Stuart Davis puts gas pumps in
his views of Gloucester, but they are just part of a cheerily
decorative nautical scheme. Hartley, who had deeply ambivalent
feelings about his home state, painted still lifes of lobsters and
gulls that might have been lifted from tourist brochures.
</P>
<P>
   In the hands of certain immigrant painters, though, the picture
darkens. Italian-born O. Louis Guglielmi gives a New Hampshire
village a surreal, purgatorial cast: Far from being quaint, it
looks ominous, shut down, its buildings as stark as tombs.
</P>
<P>
   The American black artist Jacob Lawrence touches on the region's
real history in his Frederick Douglass series. It is one that
included Abolitionism and racism, civic freedom and economic want:
a contradictory assortment of goods and evils that no body of
scholarship, never mind a single art exhibition, can hope to parse
or explain.

BOTHERED AND BEWILDERED: WICCANS AT FORT HOOD SHRUG OFF MEDIA
HUBBUB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT HOOD, Texas _ In flowing capes, medieval garb or plain
black T-shirts, civilians and off-duty soldiers joined hands and
jumped a smoldering bonfire after worshipping pagan deities,
sipping homemade honey wine and consuming ears of corn that had
been left in the fire too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a circle within a circle with no beginning and never
ending,'' intoned 60 men, women and children encircling the blaze.
``Horned one, lover son, leaper in the corn, deep in the mother,
die and be reborn,'' they chanted to the god Pan.
</P>
<P>
   These are the witches, or Wiccans, of Fort Hood, the nation's
largest military base. Its 340 square miles of semiarid brush is
home to 42,000 troops and is the headquarters of III Corps, which
includes the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized), known as ``Hell on
Wheels,'' and the 1st Cavalry Division.
</P>
<P>
   The Wiccans' full-moon rites at the on-base campsite, used on
other days by Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, have generated
international headlines _ ``Onward Pagan Soldiers,'' read one in
Britain _ as well as heat from religious conservatives, Sen. Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C., and Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is war,'' thundered the Rev. Jack Harvey of nearby
Killeen, who has vowed to run the witches off base. Harvey, who has
announced a Labor Day ``march against wickedness,'' sees no
difference between Wicca and devil worship or voodoo. He has
instructed that at least one member of his congregation carry a
handgun at services _ ``in case a warlock tries to grab one of our
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard they drink blood, eat babies. They have fires, they
probably cook them. This is unbelievably wrong,'' said Harvey, who
repeatedly pounded his desk during an interview at Tabernacle
Baptist Church, then apologized for his hell-broth boil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry. I get very emotional about this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no sign of human, or animal, sacrifice at the
Lughnassadh or first harvest service on July 31, which was followed
by a potluck turkey dinner. Adherents insist that Wicca, a
nonproselytizing faith traced back to pre-Christian nature worship
but largely reborn, with a strong feminist influence, during the
1970s, has nothing to do with Satanism.
</P>
<P>
   Like others at the Saturday night rite, Jessica Ek said she had
been a ``solitary Wiccan,'' practicing in secret for years until
discovering the Killeen ``open circle,'' which she joined after
moving from Arlington. The caped 19-year-old said she has lost
count of the bonfire vaults she made with young soldiers caught up
in the emotional exuberance of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get energy from the circle,'' said Spc. Mathew Olson, a
Lutheran-turned-Wiccan from Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   If there were any unlawful activity, it would have occurred in
the presence of Wally Freeman, 45, a Killeen police officer.
Freeman, a Mormon-turned-Wiccan, attended with his fiancee, Helen
Brewer, a Druid pagan and a member of the Daughters of the Texas
Revolution, a reflection of the gathering's diversity.
</P>
<P>
   And if there is a war for the hearts and minds of the troops,
the Wiccans seem to be holding their own.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Hood officers, citing their soldiers' constitutional right
to religious freedom, have allowed Wiccan worship since August
1997. And they have not buckled under to critics _ or rethought
their policy, as Bush urged in an interview broadcast nationally on
ABC-TV.
</P>
<P>
   The legally incorporated Sacred Well Congregation of San Antonio
had been quietly sponsoring the base rituals with little outside
notice until the Austin American-Statesman ran a lengthy piece in
May.
</P>
<P>
   Its photo of the congregation's high priest, Fort Worth-reared
psychologist David Oringderff, hurdling a Fort Hood bonfire was
widely reprinted, raising the ire of fundamentalist Christians in
Congress such as Thurmond and Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's next?'' Barr wrote in a letter to Lt. Gen. Leon J.
LaPorte, the post commander. ``Will armored divisions be forced to
travel with sacrificial animals for Satanic rituals? Will
Rastafarians demand the inclusion of ritualistic marijuana
cigarettes in their rations?''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to minimize the fuss, LaPorte has restricted news
coverage by banning photography of the pagan rituals. Base
chaplains no longer give interviews on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not the center of Wiccan worship and don't want to
be,'' said one base official, who refused to be identified by name.
</P>
<P>
   And, in keeping with the original compromise with the Texas
Wiccans, there is still no traditionally ``skyclad,'' or naked,
bonfire jumping at Fort Hood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any of us were prepared for the deluge of media
attention,'' Oringderff said over a plate of potato pancakes at a
Killeen IHOP.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
nn
</P>
<P>
   A 22-year Army veteran who retired as a major, Oringderff tries
to deflect attention from Fort Hood, stressing that his group also
sponsors Wiccan circles at bases in Florida, Louisiana, Alabama,
Alaska and in Japan and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But the huge Central Texas base remains the lightning rod of
protest.
</P>
<P>
   In June, 13 conservative religious groups announced a boycott of
enlistment and re-enlistment until Wiccan worship is taken off Fort
Hood.
</P>
<P>
   The call drew national attention. But the boycott hasn't
affected potential recruits, Army spokeswoman Maria Taylor said
from the Pentagon. Moreover, Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition
and another group have withdrawn from the boycott.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Barr was rebuffed in an attempt to insert a provision
in a military authorization bill that would have prevented Wiccans
from using base facilities or getting Army-supplied candles. It
never made it out of committee, his staff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fabulous,'' said John Machate, director of the Military
Pagan Network, a Maryland-based group that monitors treatment of
Wiccans and other pagans in the armed forces. ``This is all good
publicity. It will turn out for the best. That's not to say the
politicians have given up.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a conservative Christian and the front-runner for the
Republican presidential nomination, told ABC in June: ``I don't
think witchcraft is a religion. I would hope the military would
take a second look at the decision they made.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor might be surprised to hear that he had some Wiccan
support before taking his anti-witch stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote to Bush right away,'' said circle member Jennifer
Adams Flowers, 27, who described herself as a ``very conservative
Republican'' witch and said she is far from alone. ``I like Bush. I
think he's the best. He's done a good job for Texas. But I'm afraid
that if he gets in (the White House), we won't have any rights.
It's a real concern to me and my family.''
</P>
<P>
   In Killeen, Harvey insists that most residents oppose Wiccan
activity at Fort Hood. The independent Baptist pastor also asserted
that the witches displaced local Boy Scouts at the base campsite
and that base officials favor the pagans over fundamentalist
Christians, claiming that two evangelists were ``led away in
handcuffs'' for trying to minister to soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the evangelists, the Rev. Eric Hanna of the New Testament
Church, said he and a colleague were escorted off base, although
not in handcuffs. He said he was accused of ``high-pressure,
hard-sell evangelizing of single male soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Base spokesman Cecil Green said Scouting activities, except for
an occasional minor scheduling conflict, have not been affected.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey's campaign appears to have picked up little steam outside
his church, although he has lost track of the interviews he's
given.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all, Harvey has helped us in many ways,'' said
Oringderff's wife, Tama, who is the Sacred Well's high priestess.
``He's brought the issue up and contributed to the publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the opposition from Harvey and his allies, random
interviews at a local Kmart indicated a live-and-let-live attitude
toward the Wiccans.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's military regulations,'' said Army Spc. James Mawhorter,
21, of Michigan. ``You can practice whatever you believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Down another aisle, Rachel Morris of Killeen said the Wiccans
should be left alone ``as long as they're not hurting anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are hypercritical to the point of paranoia do not
represent mainline Christian thought or mainline churches in
Killeen,'' the Rev. Gary Kindley, senior pastor at the First United
Methodist Church of Killeen, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be a conservative community,'' said Kindley, who grew
up in Fort Worth, attended Texas Wesleyan University and received
his doctorate from Texas Christian University. ``But they are very
aware of constitutional rights because we are near a military post,
and that has a tremendous influence on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he doesn't share the Wiccans' beliefs, Kindley said he
has found little to fear from the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is that their primary interest is nature
worship, seeing God in nature and inanimate objects,'' he said.

 &HT;    Human rights lawyer says symposium sends partisan message, wants
meetings cancelled
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An upcoming judicial symposium on the death penalty at
the Chateau Elan resort in Braselton, Ga. should be cancelled
because it ``lacks balance and fails to satisfy the appearance of
impartiality,'' a human rights lawyer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Stephen
Bright, director of the Atlanta-based Southern Center for Human
Rights, said the symposium appears to be sending a partisan
message.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program appears to be geared almost exclusively to
restricting and expediting capital cases while ignoring some of the
more fundamental and important problems of the way in which death
is imposed and reviewed in the circuit,'' Bright said in a letter
to Chief Judge R. Lanier Anderson III of Macon.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Anderson, an appointee of President
Jimmy Carter, disputed any notion that the symposium is geared to
expedite death cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not the purpose of the meeting at all,'' he said.
``Rather, the purpose is to share information on the procedures in
each court and whatever problems occur in the handling of these
cases. We want to make the overall processing of capital cases
fairer to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson noted that the symposium will consider the levels of
funding for state and federal lawyers who represent capital
defendants, among other topics.
</P>
<P>
   Bright released his letter during a panel discussion on judicial
independence at the American Bar Association's annual meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   The ``State Capital Cases Symposium'' is scheduled for Aug.
19-21. Its agenda lists numerous panel sessions, as well as a
reception and dinner on Aug. 19 and an early adjournment on Aug. 20
for ``golf and other amenities.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Supreme Courts of Alabama, Florida and Georgia _
the three states that make up the 11th Circuit _ are among the 93
invitees, as are federal judges, members of state attorneys general
offices, state prosecutors and a number of death-penalty defense
lawyers, including a lawyer from Bright's office.
</P>
<P>
   The agenda includes a session on the federal perspective led by
Judge Ed Carnes of the 11th Circuit. Judge Edith Hollan Jones of
the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, will
lead another panel about capital cases in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bright criticized their leading roles, describing Carnes and
Jones as ``particularly outspoken and strident proponents'' of
capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall tenor of the symposium has the appearance of an
effort to turn the state courts and the 11th Circuit into the kind
of death mills that the state and federal courts in Texas have
become,'' Bright wrote, noting that in recent years Texas courts
have upheld death sentences in cases where the defendant's lawyers
fell asleep during trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very dire and sad situation in Texas,'' said
Charles Baird, a former Texas appeals court judge and a speaker at
the ABA panel. ``It's just an assembly line of death.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hanlon, a Florida lawyer who heads Holland &AMP; Knight's
indigent defense team, said he was going to give Bright's letter to
Chief Justice Major Harding of the Florida Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll ask him to take it very seriously,'' said Hanlon, a
speaker at the ABA panel discussion. ``I'm deeply concerned about
this symposium. The whole tenor of its agenda appears to be
slanted.''

<P>
   FORT HOOD, Texas _ In flowing capes, medieval garb or plain
black T-shirts, civilians and off-duty soldiers joined hands and
jumped a smoldering bonfire after worshipping pagan deities,
sipping homemade honey wine and consuming ears of corn that had
been left in the fire too long. ``We are a circle within a circle
with no beginning and never ending,'' intoned 60 men, women and
children encircling the blaze. ``Horned one, lover son, leaper in
the corn, deep in the mother, die and be reborn,'' they chanted to
the god Pan. These are the witches, or Wiccans, of Fort Hood, the

 &HT;    Home traders tend to transact less than office traders
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An estimated 6,000 people trade daily or very often in
day trading offices, while about 4.6 million people buy and sell
online from home, though relatively few do it daily, Internet
research firms say.
</P>
<P>
   Reliable statistics on the number of day traders and online
investors are hard to come by. But there's general agreement that
for people who go into day trading, they're better off at day
trading firms, which have more sophisticated technology than most
folks do at home.
</P>
<P>
   People who trade from home don't get orders executed as fast as
those in day-trading offices, because home-traders' orders have to
go through brokers. Often, that can mean home-traders miss a window
of dramatic movement, said Nancy Condon of the National Association
of Securities Dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials don't know how many people lose money, or how
much in day trading. One study, by Momentum Securities, one of the
biggest day trading firms, claimed 58 percent of customers lost
money within the first three months. The average loss was $21,479,
the company said, while the 42 percent who reported making money
earned an average $36,222.
</P>
<P>
   It also said two-thirds of traders who survived a three to six
month ``learning curve'' started making money.
</P>
<P>
   But regulators are dubious. The three-month study involved only
107 traders. And it didn't say how many traders made it through the
initial three-month period.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Texas said their research suggests that at least 80
percent of customers wind up in the red.
</P>
<P>
   The average home-based investor executes fewer than 15 trades a
year. The average day trader executes dozens daily, involving an
average of 700 shares each trade. Some make hundreds of trades a
day; most traders don't hold their positions for more than seven
minutes. That speed explains why about 3 percent of day traders
account for 60 percent of the day trading volume, says Dan Burke, a
senior analyst for Gomez Advisors in Concord, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their small size in the universe of tens of millions of
investors, online traders have considerable clout, accounting for
up to 25 percent of volume on the over-the-counter market and more
than $5.5 billion in daily transactions. And that will rise
steadily, because 15,000 new online accounts are being opened every
day. Burke estimates that will rise to 18 million by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   In general, commissions are comparable although strategies are
different. Traders working in day trading offices buy and sell,
sometimes as fast their fingers can move across a keyboard. Most
home traders don't day trade, but instead buy and hold, just as
they would at a discount or full service brokerage firm, said Marc
Beauchamp of the North American Securities Administration
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would recommend that even in the age of the Internet,
investors should do what they've always done: Find good companies
in growth industries and hold for the long term. The more you
trade, studies have shown, the worse you'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing inherently crooked about day trading, he added,
``it's just very risky.''

MARINE'S AILMENTS ATTRIBUTED TO MYSTERIOUS GULF DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHLEEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HESPERIA, Calif. _ Former Marine Brent Roberts is one of a
number of ailing Gulf War veterans facing impoverishment. Across
the country, veterans are losing jobs as disabling diseases rob
their bodies of strength, endurance and vitality.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, who served in the Persian Gulf War, has endured years
of aching muscles and joints, migraine headaches, intestinal pain,
an inability to keep food down _ among the ailments he brought home
from the 1991 war.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors can't identify the cause, but they've labeled his
illness Persian Gulf syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Once able to carry a 40-pound combat pack on 5-mile runs,
Roberts now uses a cane just to stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I went through all our savings,'' said Roberts,
who left his $60,000-per-year job as an assistant manager at Bally
of Switzerland on July 24, 1996, because he could not endure the
pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing left. My parents are tapped out. My in-laws
are doing everything for us now. They put us in a house they own,
so we don't have to worry about rent. If it weren't for them, we
would be homeless.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after an eight-year fight to win disability benefits,
Roberts finally had ``awesome'' news to share with his family. The
Department of Veterans Affairs had determined he was disabled and
unable to work, a decision worth $2,220 in monthly payments.
</P>
<P>
   His struggle for benefits, begun in 1991 before his health
decline began, ended when Roberts, 30, convinced Rep. Jerry Lewis,
R-Calif., to help him.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, veterans are losing jobs as disabling
diseases rob their bodies of strength, endurance and vitality:
</P>
<P>
   _ In Sacramento, a 46-year-old registered nurse was forced to
abandon a top hospital administrative post.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Oklahoma, a 31-year-old postal carrier left a job when the
joint and muscle pain that wracked his body made it impossible to
walk a 12-mile mail route.
</P>
<P>
   _ In North Carolina, a 51-year-old business owner lost his
construction company and home in foreclosure proceedings to pay his
medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how widespread the problem is, because no agency is
monitoring the plight of the veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Some, including Roberts, have filed for bankruptcy because of
mounting debts and loss of income.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts hung on to his job until he could no longer work at the
Bally store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't keep myself up without balancing on something,'' he
said. ``I was in extreme pain, even when I was completely doped up
on pain medication.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Bally, Roberts collected state disability benefits
for one year, the maximum period. His annual income plummeted to
$14,400. But the payments helped keep Roberts, his wife, Rachel,
and their infant daughter, Bailie, afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts expected a quick return to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd be off work a couple months, maybe have
surgery,'' he said. ``I never dreamed it would go on this long.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts wasn't surprised the day he came home and his pickup
truck was missing from the driveway _ repossessed. Rachel Roberts
cried the day her Honda sedan was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Roberts had filed a claim for VA disability benefits,
designed to compensate veterans who are unable to work because of
chronic illnesses or wounds related to their military service.
</P>
<P>
   The VA provides monthly payments after ``rating'' the extent of
a veteran's disability. A veteran with a 10 percent rating gets $96
per month. At 50 percent, the sum rises to $576. A 100 percent
rating translates to $1,989.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts applied for VA benefits three times, beginning in 1991.
His claim was rejected twice because the VA said his illnesses were
not related to military service. In late 1998, the claim was
forwarded to the Board of Veteran's Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, Roberts' weight, normally 165 pounds, had dropped to
110.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't hold down meat or dairy products,'' he said. ``I
was down to skin and bones.''
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997, a VA doctor, Lawrence Sandberg, gave a name to
Roberts' constellation of symptoms: Persian Gulf syndrome. In a
1998 follow-up letter, Sandberg wrote: ``This is a rare diagnosis
and, as you probably realize, not readily treatable.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, 112,000 Gulf War veterans have been examined by VA and
Pentagon doctors. About 90 percent are sick; of those, 80 percent
have diagnosed ailments, and 20 percent have conditions that remain
undiagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1997, Roberts was one of 36 Gulf War veterans chosen for
a clinical study on ``Desert Storm Syndrome'' conducted by Touro
Infirmary in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Under the federally funded study, half of the veterans received
large doses of FDA-approved antibiotics, and half received
placebos. The treatment was designed to test the Dr. Edward Hyman's
theory that a bacteria was causing the illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman said he was analyzing the results and would soon submit
his findings to a medical journal.
</P>
<P>
   When Hyman examined Roberts, he wrote: ``At this point, he is
disabled and completely unable to work. If he walks a short
distance, he gets tired and weak and short of breath. He walks with
a wobble.''
</P>
<P>
   At Touro, Roberts received three weeks of intravenous
antibiotics, a physically grueling treatment. When he returned
home, Roberts took medication for another 14 weeks under Hyman's
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts is convinced the experimental treatment has slowed the
progress of the disease, and is the key to his future health.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hadn't found Hyman, I would be in a wheelchair and unable
to walk,'' said Roberts, who learned about Hyman's study on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting recently at his kitchen table, Roberts showed off
souvenirs from the Gulf War: Saudi Arabian paper money, Iraqi
binoculars and framed photos with his buddies posing with M-16s and
rockets next to a jeep in the Kuwait desert.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Roberts rifled through a stack of documents he has
accumulated in his battle with the VA.
</P>
<P>
   One of his most precious mementos is a letter written by Dr.
Michael Ing, chief of the Infectious Diseases Section of the VA
Medical Center in Loma Linda, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to get a doctor to be on your side through this
whole process,'' Roberts said. ``If you can't get the doctors to
understand what you're feeling and going through, you're not going
to be able to go any further with your claim.''
</P>
<P>
   Ing examined Roberts in late 1998, following evaluations by
eight different specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in excellent health before serving in the U.S. Marine
Corps during the Persian Gulf War in 1990-91,'' Ing wrote Jan. 4,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor said that since service in the war, Roberts had
suffer from multiple symptoms, including rashes, weight loss,
anorexia, multiple gastrointestinal symptoms and short-term memory
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Despite extensive evaluations, the VA has ``been unable to
arrive at any other explanation for his symptoms other than his
recent service,'' Ing wrote.

PATRIOTS SHIFT AFTER JOHNSON DISASTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Plan A _ in the person of Ted Johnson _ spent
Monday afternoon with his left arm opened up on a Massachusetts
General Hospital operating table, his career once again placed in
suspended animation.
</P>
<P>
   Plan B _ in the person of rookie linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer _
spent his morning, afternoon, and evening here, his career path
gone from plodding beginner to warp-speed wannabe.
</P>
<P>
   Not even two weeks into training camp, there are new rules on
the Patriots playing field. Until further notice, the 21-year-old
Katzenmoyer will plug into Johnson's spot at middle linebacker and
Tedy Bruschi, who started regularly on defense last year for the
first time, will be barking the defensive commands that formerly
rolled from Johnson's tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had to make a quick turn here,'' said head coach Pete
Carroll. ``All I can tell you is, we never knew this was going to
come up, but we're just as lucky as we could be to have a guy like
Andy, who can fill in the spot _ a high-quality athlete with
ability to learn _ and we are very fortunate that we can turn to a
guy like this.''
</P>
<P>
   There really is no Plan C, of course. Veteran Marty Moore is an
insurance policy that the front office hopes remains tucked away in
the depth-chart safety deposit box. When Johnson left Saturday's
scrimmage with a torn biceps tendon, his season essentially
finished, Carroll and his staff made the instinctive reaction to
thust the middle linbacker's job on Katzenmoyer and anoint Bruschi
as the commander-in-chief of defensive chat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to help Andy along,'' said Bruschi, summing up his new
life, ``and make some line calls.''
</P>
<P>
   But the immediate void is obvious to everyone, no matter how
Katzenmoyer's career might bloom or how well Bruschi might grow
into the spokesman's role. Johnson, who tore up the opposite biceps
late last year, has been the leader of the defensive pack for four
years. He led the club in tackles in '96 (115) and '97 (127) and
posted a career-best 142 last season before his biceps frayed under
the force of a Jerome Bettis dash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teddy's the middle of our defense,'' said Bruschi. ``He's the
heart and soul of the linebackers. Ted Johnson is our guy; it's a
huge loss.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're never going to replace Teddy Johnson and all the things
that he brings in one season,'' added Carroll, ``but we certainly
can play a high class of football with the guys that we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Johnson going down, the highly touted Katzenmoyer, the
28th pick in this year's draft, hadn't landed himself a spot in the
starting lineup. A middle linebacker for his three years at Ohio
State, he was shifted to an outside spot here even before he signed
his contract, and immediately found himself in a duel with Bruschi
for a starter's job.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday's scrimmage, Bruschi had a clear lock on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how Andy was going to get in the lineup, to tell
you the truth,'' said Carroll. ``Going in, we were going to see how
he would fit in and where he was best suited. If he was going to
wind up starting, he was going to have to beat someone out. He's
capable of being a starter in this league for a long time. Now he's
got to learn his spot, and I think he can do a good job for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the process is the standard two-a-day drill.
Katzenmoyer, the first freshman to start at linebacker in Ohio
State history, hunkered down in drills at Bryant College. Friday
night, when the Redskins come to Foxboro Stadium, he'll have his
first taste of live NFL action. For the next month, he'll be fed a
steady diet of repetitions, teammates' advice, coaches' tactics,
and techniques. If Plan B remains Plan B for a month, he'll be out
there Sept. 12 when the Patriots face the Jets _ Tuna Bowl in
Perpetuity _ in the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Is Katzenmoyer such a quick study?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really have a choice,'' he said following the morning
workout. ``I'll be ready to go from square one.''
</P>
<P>
   He also knows the reality of the position, replacing Johnson, a
budding icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I'll be compared the whole year to Ted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson exited last season, the shift in numbers was
remarkable. In 13 games, with Johnson the center of the defense,
opposing runners managed only 87 yards per game, 3.3 yards per
carry. In the final four games, in which the Patriots went 1-3, the
defense gave up an average of 144 yards along the ground, 4.0 yards
per carry.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer can't be expected to enter with nearly the same
effectiveness as Johnson. It remains to be seen whether he can even
perform at the NFL level. He wouldn't be the first highly touted
draft pick to float into obscurity, leaving behind the empty and
echoing praise of agents, coaches, and player personnel directors.
</P>
<P>
   But Carroll, ever the Californian optimist, believes he has seen
glimpses of potential greatness in Katzenmoyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's what we know,'' said Carroll. ``He's an incredible
athlete playing the linebacker spot. I've never seen anyone as
light on his feet, around 260 pounds. He's natural. He has
instincts and feel for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   However, questions remain with regard to how Katzenmoyer's
career evolved _ some would say unraveled _ at Ohio State. After a
stellar freshman year, he was projected as a potential Top 5 pick
in the draft. His numbers improved as a sophomore, but as a junior
he too often was seen face-down on the field, the victim of failed
blitzes. As his tackles dropped, his stock fell, the questions
surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The portion of his game that I think came under scrutiny last
year,'' explained Carroll, ``they ran him through the line of
scrimmage _ they did a lot blitzes _ and when you do that, it's
feast or famine. He would run through the line of scrimmage, and
sometimes get knocked upfield and sometimes it would look like he
was out of the play, and not even trying. But he was running their
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, when you attack the line of scrimmage when you are
blitzing, and people get down into your legs, you often get knocked
down, which is the common thing they talked about. You know, `He
gets cut a lot.' This is an extraordinary athlete. He won't be on
the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The New England defense won't be the all-out blitz machine that
Katzenmoyer led at OSU. Foot speed and agility his strengths, he'll
be moving more laterally, containing and pursuing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just won't be on the ground in the system that we play,''
said Carroll. ``He'll be playing the football, running around. I
don't care what anyone else says about him, those are the things
that we saw and that we're seeing on the practice field. We're
really happy to have him here, and I really think he's going to be
a big factor for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bruschi won't be far away, aiding Katzenmoyer in
adjusting to offenses, barking out orders for the rest of the
up-front defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the position that Tedy moves into that he's really
equipped for,'' said Carroll. ``This is really a bright, savvy
football player. He understands the game as well as a player can
understand it. Even though he's a relatively young player, this guy
has natural instincts for the game, and he will help players around
him.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Adem Demaci, often called the Nelson
Mandela of Kosovo, has found some of the same serenity and
moderation, urging his fellow Albanians to use their sudden gift of
freedom to build a civilized society here.
</P>
<P>
   Demaci has spent more than 29 of his 64 years in Yugoslav jails
for his fervent belief in independence for Kosovo. He was the
``political representative'' of the Kosovo Liberation Army and in
effect its spokesman until March 3, when he quit in fury over its
willingness, under intense pressure from Washington, to accept
something less than independence in negotiations in Rambouillet,
France.
</P>
<P>
   But asked whether he now expected to see an independent Kosovo
in his lifetime, Demaci, a tiny, natty man with thick glasses, gave
the sort of answer that American diplomats had despaired of ever
hearing him utter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say that no one country in the world is truly
independent,'' he said, with a bemused look. ``Even the United
States, in a way, is not fully independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, he said _ ``and I am always an optimist'' _
reconciliation between Serbs and Albanians is both possible and
necessary, and will lead to a real state in a modern Europe of
shared sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   As Kosovo's Albanians work to better their poor lives with
international help and create real institutions, the Serbs, ``who
are in confusion now, will be released from their myths and
illusions'' about the impossibility of a Serbian nation without
Kosovo, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both peoples,'' he said, ``will make a reconciliation, and
they will both earn the right to enter Europe _ not just
geographically, but morally, in our behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's bombing war, which forced the Serbs to pull out of Kosovo
but kept the province under Yugoslav's sovereignty, has not been a
complete victory, Demaci said. But he said it provided
extraordinary opportunities under the umbrella of NATO force and
U.N. administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the unique chance in our history, with our European
friends, to build a state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians, ``after 2,000 years of slavery,'' from the Romans
through the Turks to the Serbs, ``are now breathing freely,'' he
said, ``able to decide their lives for themselves.'' With the aid
of the United Nations, they now have a chance to build ``real
institutions of civil society, all to world standards _a
non-ideological school system, a non-ideological media, a
non-ideological finance and health system _ and no more follow some
Balkan standard or communist standard.''
</P>
<P>
   It could take 10 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the United Nations must not fail in its obligation to engage
with Albanian society and politics and ``understand our history, at
least from 1945 until now,'' Demaci said. The U.N. administrators
and NATO soldiers must avoid turning into a new colonial ruler or
allowing the Kosovo Liberation Army to become an opposition, he
said. And the Albanians must not squander this extraordinary
chance, ``paid for with such blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Demaci, asked if so much tragedy was necessary, smiled
distantly, looking off toward the deep red sunset bleeding behind
the trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was impossible to change this situation without tragedy and
bloodshed,'' he said, and added, using the Albanian name for
Kosovo, ``I always wanted to die for Kosova, and I think maybe this
war was my last chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Demaci, a novelist turned radical politician hated by the Serbs
for his early and unyielding commitment to Kosovo's freedom, spent
the entire war in Pristina, walking the streets and going to the
market. His wife left Kosovo in late March, a few days after NATO's
bombing began, when a human rights lawyer, Bajram Kelmendi, and his
two sons were found dead after their arrest by police.
</P>
<P>
   But Demaci stayed, tended by his 70-year-old sister, and had a
number of run-ins with police, with two arrests.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, after being arrested, a Serbian soldier accused
him, as a representative of the Kosovo Liberation Army, of skinning
the Serb's brother alive. ``You have the gun, I don't,'' Demaci
said quietly. ``Go ahead and shoot me.'' Yet other Serbian soldiers
and policemen were polite to him, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not happy when I saw ordinary Serbs going from here,''
he said. ``We were never in danger from the Serbs as Serbs. But all
Serb regimes from 1878 until now manipulated the people here, and
every state has mechanisms to force people to do terrible things. A
bad regime has so many instruments. I'm very sad about their
leaving, but I also find that a great number of Serbs here were
involved in crimes and looting.''
</P>
<P>
   But Demaci is a firm advocate of a democratic, multi-ethnic
Kosovo, whatever the current problems and fears. ``I don't accept
freedom only for Albanians,'' he said. ``We are not angels. But we
must choose another way, which is not revenge, and understand that
all these miseries and tragedies were done by the Serbian regime,
not by every Serb.''
</P>
<P>
   Is a moderate Albanian politics possible now? ``We have no other
way,'' he said. ``Albanians know that only a moderate politics able
to guarantee freedom for Serbs and all others here is acceptable.
Otherwise, Albanians themselves will not be free.''
</P>
<P>
   Demaci, always mysterious about his age, said at first that he
was ``39 and holding.'' Pressed, he said that his real birth date
was July 26, 1935, but that his documents listed him as born on
Feb. 26, 1936. ``I was a weak baby and my father refused to
register me,'' he said. ``But six months later, my mother told him:
`You better register him. This one is not going to die.'''

 &HT;    Relax and enjoy biking with motorized assistance
 &HT;    By James Cummings

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've been wanting to enjoy the summer months by bicycling
along bike trails, but you're not sure you're physically able to
pedal long distances and up hills, you might want to check out a
bike with an electric motor.
</P>
<P>
   Bicycles are an energy-efficient way of getting around and
adding a motor can make a bike easier to use.
</P>
<P>
   With most electrical assist bikes, the rider must pedal to get
the bike going at about five miles an hour, then he or she can
engage the rechargeable electric motor to increase the cruising
speed or to help with pedaling up hills. The rider has the option
of cutting the motor off to conserve the batteries on easy terrain
and turning it on again when the going is tougher.
</P>
<P>
   CSW Total EV (for electric vehicles) is based in Tulsa, Okla.,
and offers two lines of electric bicycles and accessories, Zap and
USPD, over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Zap line features the ElectriCruisers, bikes with an
electric motor wedded to a frame with a retro look.
</P>
<P>
   ElectriCruisers have old-fashioned spring saddles, upright
handlebars and white wall tires. It comes in a model with classic
fenders and one with a lowered cross bar, the traditional ``girl's
bike'' configuration. They sell for $700 to $850.
</P>
<P>
   The Zap PowerBike looks more like a modern mountain bike. It
offers 21 speeds and can get up to 18 miles an hour. It has a range
of up to 15 miles and sells for about $900.
</P>
<P>
   The USPD Mountain Bicycle is very similar to the Zap PowerBike
and also sells for $900. The manufacturer says the Mountain Bicycle
is particularly good in off-trail situations.
</P>
<P>
   Zap and USPD also sell conversion kits to add electric motors to
existing bikes. The kits sell for $450 to $600.
</P>
<P>
   Also available are powered tricycles for about $1,000
</P>
<P>
   Both companies offer bikes specially designed for police
patrols.

STARR TO WRAP UP INVESTIGATION BEFORE 2000 ELECTIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Resigned to the nation's waning interest in his
five-year investigation, independent counsel Kenneth Starr plans to
finish before the 2000 elections and issue a report void of
interpretations or allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Declining to say exactly when his report would be finalized or
whether either President Clinton or the first lady would be
prosecuted, Starr confirmed Monday that he wants to wrap up before
Hillary Rodham Clinton stands for election to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to move forward very, very rapidly in that
respect,'' Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he will finish before the 2000 election in which
Hillary Clinton is considering a Senate bid in New York, Starr
said: ``The answer is yes.''
</P>
<P>
   In separate interviews, Starr said his report would include all
aspects of his examination of the Clintons, which began five years
ago as an inquiry into their Arkansas business dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's investigation subsequently was expanded to alleged
misuse of FBI files, politically motivated firings in the White
House travel office, and the president's sexual encounters with
Monica Lewinsky, an affair that led to his impeachment by the House
and acquittal by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would need to be a comprehensive final report _ that is
factually straight forward, that does not engage in
characterization,'' Starr told reporters after a speech to the
American Bar Association in Atlanta. ``It's clear that the Congress
did not want a final report to be an avenue for alleging that one
or more individuals had engaged in criminal conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven months ago, Starr delivered a 453-page report to Congress
alleging that the president had engaged in impeachable offenses _
perjury, witness tampering, obstruction of justice and abuse of
power _ in his effort to conceal his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, the House, without reading Starr's report,
voted to make copies available to the public and to post it on the
Internet, complete with salacious details of Clinton's affair with
the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was horrified'' by the decision, Starr said Monday in an
interview with NBC News. Adding that he was not critical of the
House, Starr said: ``I don't think I did enough to warn the
Congress (that) this is sensitive material.''
</P>
<P>
   The special prosecutor also praised the decision last month by
U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright finding that Clinton gave
false testimony in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case,
testimony that fueled Starr's inquiry into the Lewinsky affair.
Wright levied a $90,000 fine against the president, whose lawyers
said he would not appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Starr declined to call Wright's decision vindication of his
investigation, saying instead it was ``very strong language'' about
the president's statements under oath. ``This is a very
distinguished judge who looked at the facts and came to these
conclusions,'' Starr said. ``And I would just add that the system
did, in fact, work.''
</P>
<P>
   The fine, which is separate from the $850,000 awarded Mrs. Jones
in a settlement of her sexual harassment case, is aimed at covering
her legal costs related to the president's denial and efforts to
find him in contempt of court for lying about his affair with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he might still seek Clinton's indictment when the
president leaves office, Starr said: ``On that, I'm not going to
comment at all. It would be inappropriate for me to be commenting
at all about the future of the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr said he is still struck by Clinton's nationally televised,
finger-wagging denial of a sexual affair with Lewinsky. ``That is
strong. It's emphatic. It's coming from the president of the United
States,'' Starr said. ``I came to the view that, that was simply an
extraordinarily sad day.''

JAPAN'S PARLIAMENT ESTABLISHES NATIONAL FLAG AND ANTHEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In a move that spoke of strongly rising nationalist
sentiment among Japan's politicians, the upper house of Parliament
voted resoundingly Monday to designate the rising-sun flag and
longtime unofficial anthem as legal symbols of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But far from a simple matter of symbols, by the time of the vote
Monday the debate had turned into a battle among politicians and
intellectuals over the very identity and direction of this country
a half century after its defeat in World War II. In the end, the
vote proved to be heavily lopsided, with the conservative governing
coalition led by Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi passing the measure,
166-71.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bills called the legislation part of an effort
to make Japan a ``normal country'' again, a land that can be openly
self-confident and proud of itself and its national symbols after
decades of international timidity and lingering shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hinomaru'' _ the rising-sun flag _ ``is a symbol of the
modernization of Japan,'' said Takashi Ito, a professor of modern
and contemporary history at the National Graduate Institute of
Policy Studies in Tokyo. ``And even if we agree that the kimigayo''
_ the anthem _ ``refers to the emperor, the emperor is now the
symbol of a Japan which lives with a democratic Constitution given
to it by the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The anthem is interpreted by many as a paean to ``His Majesty's
Reign.'' According to the Japanese Information Center, the words
are based on a poem from ``Kokin Wakashu,'' a collection from the
10th century whose author is unknown. The music was composed by a
court musician in 1880 and was first performed in 1880 on Nov. 3 to
celebrate the birthday of Emperor Meiji.
</P>
<P>
   The flag, which was banned during the American occupation after
World War II, was first widely adopted by Japanese sailor-merchants
in the 17th century.
</P>
<P>
   The lingering sense of penance that hangs over Japan results in
part from the imposition of a ``peace constitution'' by the United
States, which forever prohibits Japan ``from threat or the use of
force as a means of waging war.'' It also results from the
country's need to atone _ even if mostly silently _ for the
atrocities inflicted by Japan's colonialist aggression in the early
half of the century.
</P>
<P>
   For many opponents of the legislation approved Monday, the
measures are only the opening sally in a series of dangerous
muscle-flexing initiatives to come. They see the moves as intended
to give the government both greater powers over the citizenry at
home and much more leeway in its conduct of national security
policies abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the funeral of democracy,'' Kiyomi Tsujimoto, deputy
secretary-general of the Social Democratic Party of Japan, said in
protesting the hurried debate on the bill. ``We ought to be
deciding on a new flag and anthem. But if they wanted to make the
old ones official, it should have been referred to a national
referendum.''
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's session, legislators also began to consider a bill
allowing the government to conduct wiretaps of suspected members of
organized crime rings. And in coming months, the Parliament is
expected to approve a bill requiring all Japanese to be assigned a
national identity number from birth.
</P>
<P>
   A recent public opinion poll by the newspaper Asahi Shimbun
shows the Japanese supporting the adoption of the flag by 59
percent to 35 percent, with a much slimmer margin, 47 percent to 45
percent, in favor of the anthem in praise of the emperor. And there
has been scarcely a murmur of protest about the measures among the
people, even as opposition politicians and some intellectuals have
railed against them.
</P>
<P>
   An even bigger milestone comes in January when Parliament is
expected to debate a revision of the constitution to give more
explicit sanction to Japan's ``collective self-defense.'' The
measure has been urged on the country by Washington, which has long
sought to secure greater military cooperation from Japan in the
event of a conflict on the Korean peninsula or elsewhere in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   This revision has long been in discussion, but received an
unexpected fillip from Japanese anxiety over the expected test
launching of a new long-range missile by North Korea in the next
few weeks. An earlier version of the missile was tested last August
and passed through Japanese airspace, helping to galvanize public
opinion in favor of stronger defense measures.

By KEN LLOYD  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: I am in sales, and our company just
implemented a new system that requires us to complete a huge amount
of paperwork. We don't see the value of most of it, but our manager
tells us that it will improve our efficiency. When we complained,
he made it very clear that the paperwork has to be completed. How
does this sound to you? C.K.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: In a word, this sounds inefficient. Although
documentation is important, it is difficult to consider increased
efficiency and increased paperwork in the same sentence. In fact,
increased efficiency of salespeople is more typically associated
with a reduction in paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   It is also remarkable that management implemented this change
without any inputs or suggestions from you and the rest of the
sales team. If management really wants to know how to increase the
efficiency of the salespeople, they should ask the salespeople.
What a concept!
</P>
<P>
   At this point, rather than complaining about management's desire
to bury you in paperwork, you and your associates should come up
with some specific ways to streamline the paperwork. There are many
high-tech solutions that can quickly and easily provide management
with the full range of sales data, and most require no paperwork at
all.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to meet with your manager, and with senior
management if necessary. Be sure to approach these meetings as
sales sessions rather than gripe sessions. If management does not
buy what you are saying, then it is apparent you are now working
for a company more interested in the volume of paperwork than of
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I work in a dental office and recently our employer brought
in someone to refresh the CPR skills of the hourly office staff.
This class took 2 1-2 (one-half) hours, and afterward our employer
said that he wouldn't pay our hourly salaries while we were in the
class. Does this seem right? W.R.
</P>
<P>
   A: Your office actually needs someone to come in and refresh
your employer's management skills.
</P>
<P>
   In the first place, as hourly employees, you are generally
supposed to be paid for the time that you spend attending a
training session. Although there can be exceptions, such as in the
cases where the training is voluntary, outside regular work hours,
and unrelated to your job, none of these criteria appear to apply
in your situation.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, your employer's approach links training with a form of
punishment, namely the lack of pay. It makes far more sense for
employers to actively support and encourage employee training,
development and growth. Your employer's action has encouraged
little more than resentment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, by failing to advise the employees up-front that
they will not be paid for attending the session, your employer has
also undermined his own credibility and trust. From this point, the
employees are going to be suspicious of any actions he may take, no
matter how supportive they may appear to be.
</P>
<P>
   You and your associates should meet with your employer to
discuss this entire situation. It sounds like there is a need for
more wide-open communication, or, since this is a dental office,
open-wide communication.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I work in a very disorganized shop in the entertainment
industry. Everything is a last-minute emergency. On every project,
the owner assigns the wrong person to the wrong task, and he says
to just get used to it. He ignores the shop manager, but listens to
people with less knowledge. The owner means well, but does not see
the light. I have been here for 2 1-2 (one-half) years, and the
only reason I hang on is that the work is fun. What is your
opinion? J.F.
</P>
<P>
   A: Some companies operate like a corporate version of an
emergency room because of the nature of their industry, while
others do so because it is the nature of the business or its owners
and managers. Regardless of the cause, it is very difficult for an
employee to have much of an impact on this mode of operation.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that you have been there for 2 1-2 (one-half) years
and you find the work to be fun. That is more than many people can
say about their work, even in crisis-free companies. There may be
something about this fast-paced, unpredictable and exciting
environment that is particularly satisfying to you.
</P>
<P>
   As for the manager who is being overlooked, this is an issue for
him or her to handle. This person may think the job is just as much
fun as you do.
</P>
<P>
   The company owner's behavior is typical of many successful
entrepreneurs _ rapid decisions, operating on ``gut feel,'' and
ignoring the chain of command. He has advised you to get used to
this, and it sounds like you have done so.

   RUSSIA-POLITICS (Moscow) _ Russian President Yeltsin fires Prime
Minister Stepashin and his Cabinet, apparently in a bid to reassert
his influence in maneuvering over next July's presidential
election. He then names Vladimir Putin, a former spy and head of
the main successor agency to the KGB. Putin, who is likely to be
approved by Parliament, would be the fourth prime minister in last
year and a half. Putin in turn announces that he will run for
president. By Celestine Bohlen. 2,000 words.

   DOLE-PROFILE (Des Moines, Iowa) _ A profile of the candidate:
When Elizabeth Dole ventured into this state in March, she was not
greeted like another mere presidential candidate but like a
superstar. But Mrs. Dole had no organizational backbone to
capitalize on the enthusiasm. And now the kleig lights have
shifted. Mrs. Dole is no longer widely viewed by the Republican
establishment as the obvious alternative should the front-runner,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, collapse. Instead of being a star,
she has faded into the chorus with the other rivals to Bush,

 &HT;    The fast and furious world of a day trader
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Day trader John E. Berner has at least one thing in
common with a concert pianist: his fingers must move quickly and
land in the right spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be quick,'' says Berner, a 31-year-old Atlanta day
trader whose fingers must hit the correct computer keys _ or the
mouse _ if he is to benefit from a sudden 12 1/2 cents or 25 cents
change in the price of a stock.
</P>
<P>
   He contends he perfected his manual dexterity during many hours
in video arcades as he was growing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first video game generation, isn't it?'' he quips.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was also the video arcade experience that prepared
him for an occupation that requires intense concentration on
another kind of screen, attached to a computer. It contains a
color-coded tableau of constantly changing numbers representing
stock prices and volumes and the ticker symbols of publicly traded
companies and brokerage accounts and numbers of trades and whether
he's ahead or behind at any given moment.
</P>
<P>
   Berner does his trading in the Atlanta office of Cornerstone
Securities, an Austin, Texas-based day trading company.
</P>
<P>
   Even for someone familiar with stock market basics, day trading
at first glance is intimidating and certainly not for the faint of
heart.
</P>
<P>
   It's definitely not a video game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to buy 500 shares of Salem Communications,'' Berner
says of a stock he has been eyeing. A click on the computer key and
it's done.
</P>
<P>
   The clock reads 10:10 a.m. as shares of the California-based
radio broadcasting company are bought for $23.62 1/2 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not going to keep it,'' Berner quickly adds. Buying
and holding is not the idea. Selling on a fractional price move is.
Even small profits add up at the end of the day, if there are
enough of them.
</P>
<P>
   Another click of the computer keyboard and the Salem
Communications shares disappear from one box and instantly show up
in another right next to it, ready for sale at $23.75 when a day
trader somewhere in America takes an interest in the stock.
</P>
<P>
   In this situation, the ticker symbol and the price at which
Berner offers the stock reside in a ``box'' devoted exclusively to
day traders. It's called ``the island,'' after Island ECN, an
electronic communications network that connects Berner to other day
traders.
</P>
<P>
   If he wished, he could offer the stock to securities brokers as
well, but this time he doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Another trader _ who knows where? _ offers to buy the stock at
$23.75 and _ click _ Berner pounces, hitting a key that accepts the
offer and sells all 500 shares.
</P>
<P>
   The clock reads 10:10 and 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   In just 10 seconds he makes a profit, minus commission. It's
small, but he made the trade mainly to demonstrate how it's done.
</P>
<P>
   On a typical day, Berner will do as many as 100 trades. And
they're not all winners.
</P>
<P>
   A log of Berner's trades in July on behalf of a New York-based
hedge fund shows 65 trades, almost half of which _ 31 _ were
losers. But in the end he posted a profit of $59,787.42 for the
month. Berner gets a percentage fee for the money he earns for the
hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   He also trades for his own account. His log for Aug. 4 shows 85
transactions: $624,403 in purchases and $640,108 in sales for a
gain of $15,705. From that, Berner had to deduct commissions of
$586 and $21.56 in other fees.
</P>
<P>
   For his own account, Berner specializes in arbitrage, a complex
and tricky practice involving the simultaneous purchase and sale of
two sets of shares in order to benefit from the spread between the
stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Berner's arbitrage is typically between the shares of companies
that are merging. A case in point is Metromedia Fiber Network, a
White Plains, N.Y., fiber-optic communications company that has
agreed to buy AboveNet Communications of San Jose, Calif., for
$1.37 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   An arbitrage trade using these stocks goes like this: Berner
buys 1,000 shares of AboveNet Communications for $26.31 per share
and sells short 1,000 shares of Metromedia Fiber Network at $25.50.
Shorting is the sale of borrowed shares on expectation that the
price will drop so the stock can be repurchased for a profit at the
cheaper price.
</P>
<P>
   The trick in arbitrage is to make money on the spread between
the two stocks. In this case it's $3.65, based on the merger
exchange formula of 1.175 Metromedia Fiber Network shares for every
share of AboveNet Communications.
</P>
<P>
   When the spread changes, it means something is happening to at
least one share price and maybe both. Berner may open a trade with
a wide spread he hopes will narrow, or a narrow spread he hopes
will widen. He is hoping this one will narrow, and looks for a
target spread of $3.40 per share. It may happen quickly, or it may
take awhile.
</P>
<P>
   He dare not look away from the computer screen for more than an
instant because he's watching the movements of two sets of numbers,
either of which could make or break the trade.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the spread finally hits $3.40 and he moves. He
sells AboveNet Communications at $26.31, not losing but not making
anything either. But he also buys Metromedia Fiber Network for
$25.25 and on that trade makes a profit of $250.
</P>
<P>
   Berner uses computers and software that connect directly to the
Nasdaq Stock Market via Island ECN, one of seven electronic
communications networks. There is an ECN that connects to the New
York Stock Exchange but day traders prefer the wholly automated
Nasdaq market to the Big Board's auction, or floor trading, system.
</P>
<P>
   These terminals display the same real time price quotes that
stock brokers and market makers see, but which are not available to
typical investors, even those who have on-line trading accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Berner is interested in Internet stocks, but his trading summary
also shows activity in stocks such as Coca-Cola, Delta Air Lines,
United Airlines, Union Carbide and AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   He came to day trading from the securities business, and says he
has no intention of quitting any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles native and former Chicago resident, he came to
Atlanta in 1991 to work for Lehman Brothers as a stock broker. He
joined the hedge fund in 1994 and started day trading in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
   He is guarded in his comments about the hedge fund, but most
such funds engage in the kind of arbitrage that Berner uses for his
own account.
</P>
<P>
   He does say his broker's background at Lehman Brothers didn't
make day trading easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here, I went through the same leaning curve as
anyone else,'' says Berner. ``What set me apart was that I was very
well aware of the damage that can be done by someone who doesn't
know what he's doing.
</P>
<P>
   On any given day, he joins 20 or more traders in the Buckhead
office of Cornerstone Securities .
</P>
<P>
   The environment is decidedly casual _ jeans and golf shirts are
prominent, occasionally sandals, few if any ties. Even the security
guard doesn't wear a uniform. Background noise comes from the
steady chatter of CNBC on one TV screen and CNN from another. Lunch
is brought in from a nearby bar-be-cue restaurant so the traders
can eat at their terminals.
</P>
<P>
   The traders are Cornerstone Securities clients, not employees,
and they pay commissions depending on trading activity _ 1 1/2
cents per share on volumes of more than 100,000 shares daily to 2
cents for fewer than 40,000 shares. Other activities carry a
variety of fees, including 3 cents per share for phone orders and a
$750 seat fee for traders who don't trade a minimum of 50,000
shares per month.
</P>
<P>
   According to some published reports, day traders must pay
up-front fees of at least $25,000 and as much as $75,000 to become
a day trader.
</P>
<P>
   But company spokesman Lee Maverick in Austin said Cornerstone
Securities does not have such a charge.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerstone Securities does require its clients to take its
12-week training course, said Maverick. The training focuses on
short-term trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still zero guarantee that you will be successful at
day trading after the training,'' said Maverick.
</P>
<P>
   He said Cornerstone Securities explains the risks, not only in
the 12-week classes but in open houses and half-day seminars for
persons who have expressed an interest in day trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to scare people away,'' said Maverick. ``We lay it down
as black and white as we can. We hope it is serious people who come
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Berner, too, thinks education must be emphasized for anyone
looking at day trading as a profession or a pastime.
</P>
<P>
   He also takes issue with those who regard day trading as
``nothing but gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Day trading is gambling only if you don't know what you're
doing,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, day trading will probably be forever linked to
the name of Mark O. Barton, whose murder rampage in the Atlanta
offices of two other day trading companies brought the mostly
obscure practice to the public's attention. Authorities believe
that huge financial losses may have been a factor in Barton's
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Barton also frightened Berner's parents.
</P>
<P>
   They were driving back to their Los Angeles home from a trip
when they heard on the radio that nine day traders had been killed
in Atlanta's Buckhead financial district. Neither the firms where
the shootings took place nor the victims were named.
</P>
<P>
   His parents stopped immediately, Berner said, and didn't stop
phoning until they reached him.

BEIJING REJECTS VATICAN'S BID FOR PAPAL TRIP TO HONG KONG  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ China has turned down efforts by the Vatican
to arrange a visit by Pope John Paul II to Hong Kong when he tours
Asia later this year, dashing hopes among Catholics in China that
ties between Rome and Beijing might improve.
</P>
<P>
   The real obstacle to the visit seems not to be the Vatican's
relationship with Taiwan so much as the wariness among Chinese
leaders about the pope's moral authority over 10 million Catholics
in China.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them worship in underground churches to evade the
Communist Party's ban on recognizing the pope as the Catholic
Church's supreme earthly authority.
</P>
<P>
   A possible visit by the pope to Hong Kong was supported by some
Catholic leaders in China, even those who swear allegiance to the
party, in the hope that it would be a first step toward warmer ties
between Rome and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican's secretary of state, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, has
said in the past that Rome would gladly move away from Taiwan if it
can establish ties with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   China's foreign ministry issued a statement Monday containing
its familiar criticism of the Vatican's ties with Taiwan, which
Beijing has considered a renegade province since the Chinese civil
war ended in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   ``Currently, the Vatican still maintains so-called diplomatic
relations with Taiwan,'' the statement said. ``Hong Kong is a
special administrative region of China. The issues involving the
pope visiting Hong Kong are rather complicated. The Vatican is
clear on this.''
</P>
<P>
   A Hong Kong newspaper reported Monday that Chinese officials had
rebuffed inquiries from Rome made after the pope expressed interest
in visiting the territory, over which China resumed sovereignty in
1997. The newspaper, The South China Morning Post, ran an
accompanying editorial saying the decision called into question the
high degree of autonomy that Hong Kong had been promised.
</P>
<P>
   Although Beijing's foreign ministry did not say so, the two
matters excluded from Hong Kong's theoretical autonomy are foreign
affairs and defense. Relations with the pope, recognized as the
head of state of the Vatican, clearly falls under China's
jurisdiction over foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   A visit by the pope to Hong Kong would have been the first since
Pope Paul VI visited in 1970. Hong Kong has about 370,000
practicing Catholics _ 250,000 ethnic Chinese and roughly 120,000
Filipinos, most of whom work as domestic helpers.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Seung, a spokeswoman for the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong,
said that local Catholic leaders learned several weeks ago that the
pope would not be visiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officially, we have not heard any explanation from Rome at
all,'' Ms. Seung said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As excited as Hong Kong Catholics would have been by a visit by
the pope, the larger issue that looms behind any such proposal is
the question of a long-term rapprochement between Beijing and Rome,
which have had not formal diplomatic ties since the Communist Party
came to power in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   A Catholic bishop in Shanghai said in an interview with an
Italian magazine several months ago that the Vatican and China had
held secret talks about improving relations but had yet to achieve
any significant progress. The bishop, Jin Luxian, expressed a
yearning for reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope represents the supreme leader of all the world's
Catholics, including those in China,'' Jin said at the time, adding
that he dreamed of seeing a papal nuncio in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   China is officially atheist and bans Christian worship outside
the ``patriotic churches'' set up under the control of the
Communist Party, which is inherently suspicious of any organization
it does not control. Many Chinese leaders are also wary of the role
that the Catholic Church played in the downfall of Communist rule
in Poland in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights organizations in Hong Kong condemned Beijing's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor said the move represented a
symbolic loss of freedom for Hong Kong. ``The decision that the
pope is not welcome lends a disastrous message around the world
that Hong Kong is no longer the free place that it was,'' the
organization said.

GOOD NEWS IN COMPUTER GAMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; These are good times for computer gamers. A
smoking-fast Pentium III computer can be had for less (in some
cases, far less) than $2,000, tricked out with all manner of
multimedia goodies to turn a game into an overwhelmingly immersing
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Even for the less obsessively tweaked gamer, a perfectly decent
machine with a still-muscular Intel Celeron or AMD K6-2 chip can be
had for several hundred dollars. Supplement the chip with any of a
range of good-quality hardware accelerators, and you've got more
than enough machine for a ton of fun.
</P>
<P>
   And on the Macintosh side, Apple has finally acquired a few
major clues, including outfitting all its machines with a 128-bit
ATI Rage accelerator to go with those screaming-fast G3 PowerPC
chips.
</P>
<P>
   Gaming companies are starting to take note, issuing more and
more titles for Macs, either as ports from an earlier PC best
seller, or as hybrid discs that run on either platform. Among the
recent notable additions to that list: &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   F &LR; OR MACS
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Caesar III: &LR;  (Sierra Studios). It's a ridiculously engaging
city-building simulation that is set in the Roman Empire. Think of
it as a kind of SimCity B.C., but better-looking and with a
pantheon of meddling gods and emperors.
</P>
<P>
   To win, you must keep Caesar, your city's residents and five
sometimes petulant gods happy while building up commerce, culture,
education, infrastructure, agriculture, religion and trade.
</P>
<P>
   The graphics are gorgeous and often quite witty, and the
challenges are many, including the possibility of exile or invasion
if you can't keep everyone happy, fed and entertained while
remaining in the black. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   Quake II &LR; : (Activision) Mac players with an itchy trigger finger
will welcome the conversion of Quake II by Activision. It comes
just ahead of the release of Quake III Arena _ the much-anticipated
online sequel _ and should whet the appetites of hard-core gamers
for that release. As it is, this one allows up to 32 people to play
each other on the Internet or a local-area network.
</P>
<P>
   As with the various PC iterations of Quake, you're a Marine
cleaning out an infestation of deadly invaders with a wide variety
of lethal weaponry. Not politically correct, and please keep it
away from the kids, but definitely one of the best of this
particular genre. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   Brood War expansion set for StarCraft &LR; : (Blizzard) Another
notable conversion, this one of last year's best-selling PC game,
the real-time strategy StarCraft. The game features three very
different species battling each other for control of the universe,
or at least a little part of it. The expansion set gives you more
of the same good stuff, including 26 new scenarios, more than 100
new multiplayer maps and many new units. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
FOR PCs
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Total Annihilation: Kingdoms: &LR;  (Cave Dog) This is one of the
most eagerly awaited games to come out this summer, a sequel to the
dark and foreboding real-time strategy game Total Annihilation.
That game, set to wonderfully done music in some distant
science-fiction future, created a rich mood and challenging game
play.
</P>
<P>
   The Kingdoms sequel takes a very different tack, transporting a
player to an ancient world called Darien, where four very different
nations jostle against each other and a threatening new force.
</P>
<P>
   The sequel shifts the game from sci-fi to fantasy, adding magic,
dragons, skeleton fighters and the like. The scale of the fighting
somehow feels different from the original, too, but it still works
great.
</P>
<P>
   And, taking a cue from Blizzard's Battle.net, you can play
online for free at Cave Dog's Boneyards online community. This is a
very good thing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Disney Action Game _ Tarzan: &LR;  (Disney Interactive) In a
completely different realm, Disney recently released a rash of
titles connected with its excellent new ``Tarzan'' animated film.
</P>
<P>
   I have to grouse a bit about the genericized names of the new
titles, which include Disney Print Studio Tarzan, Disney Activity
Center Tarzan and Disney Action Game Tarzan.
</P>
<P>
   Disney Interactive, which routinely puts out good-quality
products, has come to see these things as almost rote efforts,
issued along with the backpacks, burger-franchise kid-meal toys and
other merchandise of every big release.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, it's hard to remember if this is a title for
Tarzan or Hercules or the Lion King, but that attitude can be the
death of good gaming, or any other kind of entertainment, for that
matter.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the action game is excellent (quite similar to the
PlayStation version), with a choice of four characters you can
play, tons of video excerpts from the film, great 3-D graphics and
a range of challenges, including swimming, swinging, riding
elephants and storks, and more.
</P>
<P>
   The activity center title is pitched for a younger crowd, ages 4
to 8. Its best features include a journal-making capability and a
musical ``trash the camp'' function, just as the apes did in the
movie. The activity center also provides lots of printable goodies,
games, stickers and more.
</P>
<P>
   The print studio, like its predecessors for other movies, allows
you to easily create a wide array of Tarzan-themed stationery,
greeting cards, invitations and the like, as well as make online
greeting cards.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Atari Arcade Hits: &LR;  (Hasbro Interactive) For you old-school
gamers, and I mean really old school, Hasbro has revived the old
Atari name and begun issuing an array of classic arcade games on
the PC, PlayStation and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   On Atari Arcade Hits, Hasbro hasn't even revamped the games to
take advantage of new technologies. Instead, you get to play six
much beloved classics: Asteroids, Tempest, Centipede, Missile
Command, Super Breakout and Pong.
</P>
<P>
   There's some other window dressing, such as an interview with
Atari founder Nolan Bushnell, but this is basically the first legal
chance to play these games on a PC.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the code for the games has been available, illegally,
for years on the Internet's Usenet newsgroups, free for the
downloading. All you had to do was find the right emulator software
(also available for the persistent) to make your computer mimic the
old code's old platform, and you were ready to start shooting
centipedes.
</P>
<P>
   But now, for less than $30, you have a more honorable
alternative _ and a better-looking one, too. Atari forever. Amen. &QL;

CAMERA OFFERS E-PHOTO CAPABILITY FOR UNDER $90
</HEADLINE>
 (Weekly Digital L.A. column) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Among the cool gadgets that have come across my
desk lately _ and I get to see lots of cool gadgets _ is the JamCm
from K-B Interactive Gear.
</P>
<P>
   It's a nifty little digital camera, mostly targeted for children
or informal users who have computers and like to take snapshots. It
walks a middle ground between the pricey megapixel boxes that
deliver near-professional quality for several hundred dollars and
the cheap, low-resolution toys such as Mattel's Barbie camera that
came out last year.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, the JamCm works on both Macintoshes and PCs, using
that ever-so-flexible USB port and an included cable. It also comes
with a serial port and cable to connect to older PCs.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-release version I tested also came with a raft of
software, including Microsoft's Picture It! 99 and ArcSoft's Photo
Fantasy that together allow you to easily transfer shots from the
camera to the computer, where you can clean them up, dress them up
and ship them off to e-mail or the printer.
</P>
<P>
   The company was still getting its Macintosh drivers and
photo-editing software together, so I can't speak for how well it
works on those machines. But on the PC side, importing snapshots
into Picture It! was, well, a snap.
</P>
<P>
   Picture quality was solid, especially for an $89 camera. The
camera actually gives you three resolution choices, with the best a
quite respectable 640 by 480.
</P>
<P>
   The results aren't in quite the same league as traditional film,
but it's not like no-focus snapshot cameras typically provide much
greater control. And unlike those snapshot cameras, you don't have
any developing hassles.
</P>
<P>
   Once it's in the computer, you can do a lot of fun things.
</P>
<P>
   The extremely lightweight camera body is a bright yellow with
black rubber grips that protect it from rough handling. Operation
is extremely simple, boiled down to two buttons and an LCD screen.
</P>
<P>
   The only knock? It only takes eight shots before you need to
download the ``film'' to your computer, at least at the highest
resolution (you can squeeze 48 shots off at 240-by-180 resolution,
but that starts to get pretty fuzzy). But hey, you can't have
everything, at least not yet. For now, anyway, the JamCm is
slamming good fun. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
COOL TOOL OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   The Internet's MP-3 music revolution has been bubbling along at
a pretty remarkable rate lately, with a new generation of portable
players coming out the next several weeks in preparation for this
Christmas gift season.
</P>
<P>
   I like these tiny, lightweight music players as much for their
potential as their reality, though they'll definitely be a lot
better with another generation or two of development behind.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, none can keep up with the toy I saw Compaq engineers
showing off at this week's Herring on Hollywood conference in
Century City.
</P>
<P>
   The Compaq player is about the size of a cassette Walkman,
making it two or three times bigger than the tiny Diamond Rio or
Creative Technologies Nomad MP-3 players.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike those machines, which have only enough internal
memory to store about 30 minutes of music (with removable,
expensive flash memory cards that add another half hour each), the
Compaq player has an internal four-gigabyte hard drive that will
store up to 70 hours of tunes, about enough to drive across the
country without hearing the same song twice.
</P>
<P>
   The player probably won't be stuffing anyone's stocking this
Christmas, however. Developed by the wizards at the old Digital
Electronic Corp. research lab (now part of Compaq), it's a product
waiting for a partner.
</P>
<P>
   When Compaq does find a consumer electronics company to help
make and market the player, however, expect it to sell well. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE GAMING UNDERGROUND
</P>
<P>
   The NeoGeo Pocket Color gaming machine is actually going to be
available in the stores of half-a-dozen large chains, including K-B
Toys, Babbage's and Electronics Boutique beginning this weekend.
The list price is $69.99.
</P>
<P>
   The handheld machine, previously only available through SNK's
Internet site, has a great 16-bit color screen, analog controller
stick and decent array of titles at its debut.
</P>
<P>
   But whether it'll become a serious challenger to Nintendo's
handheld titan, the four-bit Game Boy Color (and the Game Boy's
hundreds of titles) is another thing. Check out the NeoGeo if you
get a chance, however. The technology, for a handheld, is quite
impressive, and it does include a decent of variety of games such
as PacMan. &QL;

 &HT;    Day trading: Legitimate career or gambler's paradise?
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In another time and another place, Mark O. Barton
might just have been a high-stakes gambler who spent his days _ and
money _ at the horse track or the craps tables.
</P>
<P>
   But his addiction was a more modern one, born of the high-tech
age. He plunked down huge bets not on long-shot nags but on a
long-shot method for trading stocks, devised for bold, rich and
naive speculators. And suckers.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of a few thousand Americans to embark on a ``career''
in online trading _ in his case day trading, a financially
dangerous pursuit that may sound more legitimate than betting on
horses, but in reality is much the same.
</P>
<P>
   So were his results.
</P>
<P>
   Like most gamblers, he lost, and in a big way, squandering some
$450,000 at the two Buckhead day trading firms where he later
killed nine people.
</P>
<P>
   Whether his losses drove him to murder will never be known, but
securities regulators have been warning for months about the
financial risks in day trading, basically a get-rich-scheme in
which a handful of brokerages offer training, computers and loans
to dreamers fed up with the normal workaday world.
</P>
<P>
   But no amount of training can overcome the volatility of the
stock market, and the quick access to electronic trading
accelerates the gambling pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you were required to leave the house to be separated from
your money,'' said Stuart Vyse, a Connecticut College psychologist
who specializes in collective behavior. ``Unfortunately, day
trading on the Internet has the same psychological appeal as
playing a slot machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eric Hollander, director of the Compulsive, Impulsive and
Anxiety Disorders Program at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New
York, said day trading is a form of pathological gambling by people
who ``crave high levels of stimulation and like to live on the
edge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Individuals who have pathological gambling problems are at
increased risk for having financial difficulties, marital problems,
legal complications, job-related problems, all due to wagering
behavior,'' he said. ``When you put all that together, the rate of
suicide or aggressive behavior is extremely high in these
patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton, by family, police and accounts in court documents, was
that kind of person. The man fellow traders called ``Rocket''
because of the highs he hit when his stocks soared, hit deep lows
when his picks lost, such as the time he turned to his wife last
Christmas and said, ``I've lost it all. I need help.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Doyle, an analyst for Forrester Research, a Cambridge,
Mass.-based ``E commerce'' research firm, said day trading is
gambling, whether done in office settings or from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have investable net assets of a million dollars,
it's a crappy idea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day trading industry would like to hold it out as a viable
career opportunity, and it's not,'' said Marc Beauchamp of the
North American Securities Administrators Association, which
represents stock regulators in every state. ``Their advertising
suggests, 'Hey, come on down, and you'll get rich.' But the
evidence we've developed suggests the majority, perhaps the vast
majority, lose money.''
</P>
<P>
   Day trading is a dangerous trend for Main Street as well as Wall
Street, because it's the day traders who're mostly responsible for
wild fluctuations in the prices of scores of Internet stocks, said
Fred Allvine, head of the Stock Market Project at Georgia Tech. And
an increase in day trading, he added, can only add fuel to the
speculative fires that have been driving the stock market at a
frenzied pace for the past few years and could eventually cause it
to fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gambling in the market, or in the lotteries or in Las Vegas,
is all part of the get-rich-quick schemes that are are going on,''
he said. ``Gambling is prohibited in many states and not permitted
because of the destructive nature of these activities. Yet we
permit some of the public to be fooled by thinking they are going
to win the lottery or hit the jackpot through day trading.''
</P>
<P>
   And for the past few years, he added, the public seems to have
forgotten what gambling means. They're fooled by ``all the wealth
they see around them,'' he said, though much of it is illusory.
</P>
<P>
   Even the industry, which consists of about 60 firms with more
than 280 offices around the country, concedes day trading isn't for
the faint of heart. Momentum Securities, one of the firms where
Barton traded and returned to kill four people, points out in
bold-faced type in its literature that ``extreme loss'' is a
distinct possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``In your initial months of trading, you will lose money,''
conceded Jeff Eller, a spokesman for both Momentum Securities and
the Electronic Traders Association, a Houston-based trade group.
Eller maintained that some day traders make money, but allowed,
``It's not for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Not by a long shot, said Beauchamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been made out to be glamorous and all that, but in fact,
it's very risky, very stressful, very hard work,'' he said. ``It's
not fraud, but in short order you can lose a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Most day trading firms, including Momentum Securities and
All-Tech Investment Group, in whose Atlanta offices Barton killed
five people, require customers to take training courses, put up at
least $50,000, have a net worth of $100,000 or more and income from
something other than day trading, Eller said.
</P>
<P>
   In Barton's case, he listed annual income of $85,000 on his
registration form at Momentum Securities, where he went after
losing thousands at All-Tech Investment Group. He also listed
annual income of $40,000 for his wife, whom he murdered along with
his two children before taking his guns to Buckhead. Barton also
pledged that he'd taken a $5,000 training course from All-Tech
Investment Group, that he knew what he was doing and fully
understood the risks. All-Tech Investment Group declined any
comment.
</P>
<P>
   But federal and industry regulators don't think the quick-check
applications spell out the risks in strong enough terms. And by
providing computers, work space and loans, regulators say firms
like All-Tech Investment Group and Momentum Securities encourage
traders to get in over their heads. In some cases, day traders have
used retirement money or second mortgages to try to recoup losses
and pay back loans.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, advertisements tout day trading as a career, as a
glamorous lifestyle, said Mike Shokouhi, a spokesman for the
National Association of Securities Dealers, which represents
mainstream Wall Street brokers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they do have speedier links to the market than do
home-based Internet traders. That means traders can execute a deal
faster, thereby cashing in on slight but significant market
fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
   Some firms seem to all but guarantee profit, Beauchamp said,
though the opposite is known to be true, at least during the first
six months or so of trading. One newspaper ad asked, ``How would
you like to get rich day trading?'' An ad for one of several how-to
books asks ``Are you ready to quit your day job?''
</P>
<P>
   Barton wrote on his Momentum Securities application he'd seen an
ad while watching TV.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows the number of day traders, but Dan Burke, a senior
analyst for Gomez Advisors in Concord, Mass., puts it as high as
6,000. That's not counting 4.6 million people who have the
capability to trade daily from home via the Internet, he said,
because relatively few trade so often.
</P>
<P>
   Most professional investors, like top officials of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, the Securities Industry
Association and state regulators, share the view that day trading
is too risky to be a primary source of income.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip M. Larkins, an analyst for Atlanta's Legacy South
investment firm, said he's never day traded in 30 years in the
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not investing, it's just a form of very rapid-fire
speculation,'' he said. ``It's just definitely not a good idea for
the average person. We get occasional calls from clients who've
heard about day trading, and we tell them it's sheer speculation, a
gamble.''

CHANGRA X-RAY OBSERVATORY HITS INTENDED OPERATING ORBIT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASA's $1.55 billion Chandra X-ray Observatory, deployed by the
shuttle Columbia last month, has successfully maneuvered into its
intended operating orbit, the space agency said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The final maneuvers, placing the 40-foot long space telescope in
an elongated orbit with high and low points of 86,487 miles and
5,999 miles, were conducted over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual orbit places Chandra above interference from the
Earth's Van Allen radiation belts for its observations.
</P>
<P>
   Though both the final high and low points of the orbit are lower
than pre-mission targets of 86,992 miles and 6,214 miles, they are
nonetheless within the ranges established prior to launching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything continues to go extremely well with activation of
the world's most powerful X-ray telescope,'' said Fred Wojtalik,
NASA's Chandra program manager.
</P>
<P>
   With remote commands, ground control teams may elect to open the
telescope's 7-foot-long outer door later this week, allowing X-rays
from space into the telescope for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Controllers are in the process of activating and calibrating
Chandra's science instruments. They do not plan to take and
publicly present their first science observations until late this
month.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbia astronauts blasted off with Chandra late July 22
and deployed the telescope with its large expendable booster into
an orbit 173 miles above the Earth several hours later. Two burns
by the booster and a handful more by the telescope's internal
propulsion system over the period that followed placed the
instrument in its observation orbit.
</P>
<P>
   The X-ray observatory was developed over two decades for studies
of the most energetic processes in the universe, including black
holes, stellar explosions, galactic collisions and distant quasars.
</P>
<P>
   As the third of NASA's Great Observatories, Chandra joins the
Hubble Space Telescope and the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. All
were intended to help astronomers explain the evolution of the
universe.

 &HT;    Owner of Channel 14, PaxTV ready to sell
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Paxson Communications has hired an investment banker
and may sell off a stake in its television holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The West Palm Beach, Fla.-based company said Monday it hired
Salomon Smith Barney to explore whether to merge or sell to another
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Paxson, which airs the PaxTV network, owns 72 stations
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   A ruling last Thursday by the Federal Communications Commission
promoted Paxson's hiring of an investment banker. The agency, which
regulates the television and radio industries, decided to let
companies own two stations in the top 50 markets.
</P>
<P>
   This ruling, which lets the big television groups expand their
holdings, has made Paxson's stations valuable. Many of the stations
are in the top markets such as Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Paxson Chairman Lowell W. Paxson said Thursday that his company
has been considering several moves with other industry interests,
including those in radio, television and cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   One possible scenario, said Paxson, was to sell up to 32 percent
of the company's stock to one of the big four networks. It would be
in exchange for a programming alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can have a major station owner or a network come in ... and
have a synergistic relationship by supplying programming to one
another,'' Paxson said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Paxson also said he would be willing to sell his entire station
group for the right price.

   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   My friend Pat Strum's daughter, Jennifer, who lives in Chicago,
was about to be married. A bridal shower was being planned for her
by her mother-in-law in Chicago, who suggested that she register
her gift preferences in a few stores there for the convenience of
guests. Her mother, who lives in Westchester, couldn't get out to
the Middle West to help her daughter choose some of the items, but
she came up with a very 90's thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get in your car now, take your cell phone and drive to the
Bed, Bath and Beyond there,'' she said. ``I'll drive to the store
here and call you when I get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, mother and daughter were on the phone as they went
up and down the aisles, one in Chicago, one in Westchester,
shopping and selecting everything from pots and pans to dishes and
sheets.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ELLEN R. GOLDIN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Richard Oberfield and his wife, Sharon, were walking along
Broadway when they noticed a large crowd by the curb and a taxi
stopped in the middle lane with its hazard lights blinking. The
driver was leaning out the window, screaming at a woman who was
standing in front of his cab. She, arms crossed, faced him
defiantly.
</P>
<P>
   The woman apparently had been crossing Broadway as the light
changed. The cab had almost struck her and she was not going to
move until the driver apologized. The onlookers were debating the
situation: ``She was jaywalking''; ``he almost killed her''; ``he
could at least say he was sorry''; ``you know men never
apologize,'' etc.
</P>
<P>
   The police finally arrived. The crowd speculated whether one or
the other or both would be arrested. The verdict: the driver, the
woman and the crowd were all told to move on. As she strolled off,
the woman looked back at the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must all be really bored,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another street vignette:
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Morris and her husband were walking near 54th Street
and Avenue of the Americas last month when they noticed a crowd
staring at the side of a building. Possibly a man rappelling down
off the roof? Not at all. It was an enormous iguana (an estimated 3
feet long), clinging vertically to the brick face about six stories
up, basking in the sun. The police were on hand, perhaps to arrest
the iguana or perhaps to make sure that no one was injured if it
fell, but everyone seemed more amused than concerned. Finally,
after one scary moment when it seemed to lose its footing, the
iguana managed to climb back onto a ledge and into the building.
The drama ended. The audience applauded and dispersed.
</P>
<P>
   I was on a flight recently from La Guardia to Chicago and
Spokane when our very full plane was held on the ground because of
weather. After about three hours, our flight attendant announced
that there was a family of refugees from Kosovo on the flight who
did not speak English and were confused about the long delay. He
asked if anyone spoke a language they might understand; he had
tried German with no success.
</P>
<P>
   One of the passengers tried French and I tried Russian, to no
avail. We learned from their tickets that they were going to
Spokane. We realized, however, that we could not possibly explain
all the contingencies facing them, like where they would go if we
had to remain in New York or Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   I then remembered that there were several ethnic Albanians from
the former Yugoslavia who worked in my Manhattan apartment
building. I reached one of them on a cell phone, explained the
various contingencies to him and then handed the phone to the
mother. When she heard his voice explaining the situation in her
native tongue, she broke out in a smile and chatted animatedly
while the surrounding passengers cheered.
</P>
<P>
   The flight did make it to Spokane that same night, and hopefully
the family's long journey was eased by one of the many unique
aspects of New York.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _PATRICIA HEWITT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   On a visit to Washington, Georgina Ardalan was crossing an
intersection where construction work was taking place. The traffic
lights were in a muddle, causing havoc among the cars. She was late
for an appointment, and began weaving and dodging her way around
the vehicles. When she got to the other side, a traffic officer
screamed, ``Where you from?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you ask?'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Cause you cross the street like a New Yorker,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   She laughed and yelled back, ``I'll take that as a compliment.''
</P>
<P>
   After hailing a taxi on the Upper East Side on a scorching hot
and humid day, I automatically jumped into the back seat. The
windows were closed but no air was coming through the vents. Almost
immediately, the driver pulled back the partition and said ``You
better get up here, you'll suffocate back there.'' I hesitated for
only a micro-second before getting into the front seat, where the
weak air-conditioning made breathing possible.
</P>
<P>
   This is unique, I said to myself. Now what is front-seat
passenger etiquette? It wouldn't be polite to read my magazine. It
would be rude to simply stare out of the window. ``Wow, it really
is hot,'' I offered lamely. ``Yes,'' he replied, smiling and
looking straight at me. ``I just got back from visiting my family
in Trinidad. It was better weather there.''
</P>
<P>
   We went on to chat about our families and how many years we had
lived in New York (35 for me, 10 for him), the Yankees, the Mets
and the coming Senate race. I felt like I was on a date. I thanked
him when we reached my destination and almost forgot to pay the
fare as I opened the door. ``Oops, I'm sorry,'' I said, handing him
the money. ``That's O.K.,'' he said. ``It wasn't like a regular
ride, it was fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' I agreed. ``See you next heat wave.''

   &UR; DAD TALK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Three boys are in the schoolyard bragging about their fathers.
The first boy says, ``My Dad scribbles a few words on a piece of
paper, he calls it a poem, they give him $50.''
</P>
<P>
   The second boy says, ``That's nothing. My Dad scribbles a few
words on a piece of paper, he calls it a song, they give him
$100.''
</P>
<P>
   The third boy says, ``I got you both beat. My Dad scribbles a
few words on a piece of paper, he calls it a sermon. And, it takes
eight people to collect all the money!''

<P>
   For the first time, in an interview in a new magazine called
``Talk,'' Hillary Clinton has spoken out about President Clinton's
affair, and she says that Bill's affair with Monica was a sin of
weakness. That's kind of an understatement. Saying Clinton has a
weakness for women is kind of like saying Jeffrey Dahmer has an
eating disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tripp has been indicted on two counts of violating
Maryland's wiretapping laws and one count of violating Maryland' s
thong bikini law. They're very strict on that.

   According to a new study, women who suppress their anger suffer
from memory loss. You think that's true? Why is it whenever you get
in a fight with them, they can remember every little thing you've
done? Back to high school. Boy, it's been hot. It's not bad here,
but back east it' s been really hot. People are sweating like Dan
Quayle trying to do a crossword puzzle.

   Yesterday the Baseball Umpires' Union filed a lawsuit against
Major League Baseball. I guess they thought they were getting a bad
deal, so all the umpires resigned, then they wound up getting
fired. Now they want their jobs back. Major League Baseball says
they may never hire these guys again. See the umpires are going
about this all wrong. If you want to get back into baseball, here's
what you do: You smoke crack, you pick up a hooker, and you'll be
back in two weeks.

<P>
   The husband replies, ``No _ I'm turning the heating off.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SHAGGY TURTLE TALE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Three turtles, Joe, Steve, and Poncho, decide to go on a picnic.
So, Joe packs the picnic basket with cookies, bottled sodas, and
sandwiches. The trouble is, the picnic site is, 10 miles away, so
the turtles take 10 whole days to get there. By the time they do
arrive, everyone's whipped.
</P>
<P>
   Joe takes the stuff out of the basket, one by one. He takes out
the sodas and says, ``Alright, Steve, gimme the bottle opener.'`
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't bring the bottle opener,'` Steve says. ``I thought
you packed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe gets worried. He turns to Poncho. ``Poncho, do you have the
bottle opener?''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Poncho doesn't have it, so the turtles are stuck ten
miles away from home without soda. Joe &AMP; Steve beg Poncho to turn
back home and retrieve it, but Poncho flatly refuses, knowing that
they'll eat everything by the time he gets back.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, after about two hours, the turtles manage to convince
Poncho to go, swearing on their great-grand turtles' graves that
they won't touch the food.
</P>
<P>
   So, Poncho sets off down the road, slow and steadily.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty days pass, but no Poncho. Joe and Steve are hungry and
puzzled, but a promise is a promise. Another day passes and still
no Poncho, but a promise is a promise. After three more days pass
without Poncho in sight, Steve starts getting restless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I NEED FOOD!'' he says with a hint of dementia in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``NO!'' Joe retorts. ``We promised.''
</P>
<P>
   Five more days pass and the two are near starvation. Near death,
the two turtles weakly lift the lid to get a sandwich. As they open
their mouths to eat, Poncho pops out behind a rock, and says,
``Just for that, I'm not going!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SHAGGY DOG TALE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A sign was hung in an office window. It read:
</P>
<P>
   Help wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Must type 70 words a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Must be computer literate.
</P>
<P>
   Must be bilingual.
</P>
<P>
   An equal opportunity employer.
</P>
<P>
   A dog was ambling down the street and saw the sign. He looked at
it for a moment, pulled it down with his mouth, and walked into the
manager's office, making it clear he wished to apply for the job.
</P>
<P>
   The office manager laughed and said, `I can't hire a dog for
this job.` The dog pointed to the line: `An equal opportunity
employer.`
</P>
<P>
   So the manager said, `OK, take this letter and type it.` The dog
went off to the word processor and returned a minute later with the
finished letter, perfectly formatted.
</P>
<P>
   The manager said, `Alright, here's a problem. Write a computer
program for it and run it.` Fifteen minutes later, the dog came
back with the correct answer. The manager still wasn't convinced.
`I still can't hire you for this position. You've got to be
bilingual.`
</P>
<P>
   The dog looked up at the manager and said, `Meow.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FIRST LADY BLUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing how the whole campaign has caught on. The thought
of a sitting First Lady Of The United States considering running
for an elective office is truly amazing. In New York City,
everybody has a ``Run, Hillary, Run'' bumper sticker on their car.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats put them on their rear bumpers.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans put them on the front.

all the fighting about?

<P>
   &UR; BODY LANGUAGE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A man is told by his doctor to take on some sport, so he decides
to take up tennis. After a couple of weeks his secretary asks him
how he's doing. `It's going fine.` the manager says. `When I'm on

immediately says, 'to the corner! Back hand! To the net! Smash! Go
back!'`

 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EASTHAM, Mass. _ It is only a summer fantasy, but such an
uplifting one. Transcendent; a tinge pagan; in a fancy word,
Thoreauvian.
</P>
<P>
   You are strolling along the salt-marsh path with Henry David
Thoreau, taking note of his well-worn walking stick and the
leisurely lilt in his step. The reeds issue a soprano hissing, the
water ripples busily and he turns to you and says:
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us spend one day _ one day! _ as deliberately as nature,
and not be thrown off the track by every nutshell and mosquito's
wing that falls on the rail!''
</P>
<P>
   He pulls his flute from the back pocket of his corduroys and
breathes some slow trills, and you float into contemplative
silence.
</P>
<P>
   Ahh. Anyone who finds such a momentary illusion sweeter than any
beach-season bestseller owes thanks to a retired high school
English teacher named David Barto, who has ``brought Henry,'' as he
puts it, for a summer on Cape Cod, lasting through Aug. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Eight times a week, for an hour or more, Barto, as Thoreau,
walks with visitors or presents lectures, never stepping out of
muslin-shirted character, always answering their questions from the
immense compendium of Thoreauviana he holds in his head.
</P>
<P>
   For such labor at the Salt Pond Visitors' Center of the Cape Cod
National Seashore and hereabouts, he receives $9 a day in meal
money from the National Park Service, and a room.
</P>
<P>
   An adjunct professor of composition at the University of Nevada
in Las Vegas during the school year, he paid his own plane fare to
get here, and does not know whether he will be able to afford to
return next summer. He can no longer afford a car, he said, but the
park service lends him a bike while he's here. And once, a kind
stranger who saw him ``footing it'' it on the road called, ``Hey,
Hank, would you like a lift?''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of historical sites have actors playing long-dead
characters brought back to life _ the Thomas Jefferson at
Williamsburg, the George Washington at Washington Crossing, Pa. On
stage, Hal Holbrooke does a famous Twain, of course. And a local
actor in Wellfleet _ the whole area is heavy Thoreau country
because of his posthumously published book, ``Cape Cod'' _ has
portrayed Thoreau in a set piece.
</P>
<P>
   But the special nature of Barto's unusual art is that it is
never a set piece. It is, to use the most anachronistic of terms,
interactive, never the same twice, dependent on what he happens to
see as he leads a group of tourists about, or what they ask. And it
is especially fragile in that, lacking a permanent gig as he does,
it depends almost entirely on his own enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Which is how it all began. One day, in 1974, Barto's 10th-grade
English class at Pennsbury High School in Lower Bucks County, Pa.,
seemed so bored as it read Thoreau that he thought to himself: the
only thing that would fire them up would be if Thoreau himself came
back from the dead to talk to them.
</P>
<P>
   Light bulb flash. At first, when he appeared in costume and
character, the students laughed at him, but by the end they were
asking him questions. And a few years later, when ``Henry'' talked
about the importance of following one's dream and living by one's
convictions, a whole class ended up in tears, Barto said. That day,
two student library aides who had heard the speech asked the
librarian if they could talk about life instead of filing.
</P>
<P>
   There were people who said ``You can't keep this to yourself,''
Barto said. He ended up ``bringing Henry'' to Walden Pond, in
Concord, Mass., and putting on programs there every summer from
1984 through 1996, until the money and his energy ran out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in my blood to be a teacher,'' he said, ``and being
Thoreau is like the highest form of teaching you can do. It's
immediate. There he is, standing there, and you can ask him
anything you want.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the best teachers _ perhaps especially the best
teachers _ burn out. After 25 years of long high school teaching
days, and a dozen years of squiring Henry around every summer,
Barto retired in 1996. Now, at 49, he is carrying out his plan to
live five different places in retirement: in a desert _ hence Las
Vegas _ at the seaside, on a farm, in the woods and in a city.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of rest, however, ``Henry'' could not stay
retired. Indeed, what a waste that would be: Barto knows so much
verbatim Thoreau he could recite it for at least two hours
straight, he said, and has it memorized by category, so that any
mention of sunrise or sea or dogs or civil disobedience can set him
off on that subject.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, though, he said, he is a teacher, and while the material
is well-worn to him, he still feels gratified when a listener
responds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly, I leave them with a sense of who this man was,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the listeners, some extol their time with Henry and
pepper him with questions; one commented on a recent morning, ``I
felt a couple of times as if we were all born way too late.'' And
Mike Whatley, the supervisory park ranger here, said attendance at
the Thoreau talks has been excellent. Two dozen listeners came one
recent perfect sunny morning, and another two dozen on an evening
walk Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Of Barto, Whatley said, ``He's an unusual character. He refuses
to step out of character when he's in it.'' But the Henry character
certainly works well, he said, and Thoreau was such a fine
naturalist that his Cape Cod book, about his travels here, is still
current in many ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to have him back next summer,'' Whatley said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, as summer wanes, Barto sets out many a morning
and evening leading tourists whose vacation torpor is broken by
bright-eyed memories of what it meant to read ``Walden'' the first
time. Or to first hear, ``If a man does not keep pace with his
companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let
him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Barto, while he is in character, why he does this and he
responds in his stentorian 19th-century tones: ``I am drawn. The
day when I am no longer drawn, I will sleep peaceably with my
family and friends in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As the race to succeed him next year threatens to slip
out of his control, Russian President Boris Yeltsin tipped his
hand, and Russia's political apple cart, by firing his prime
minister on Monday and replacing him with a former KGB officer and
loyal aide whom he named as his candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   Coming from a politician who regularly uses surprise as a
weapon, Yeltsin's latest move, naming Vladimir Putin to succeed
Sergei Stepashin _ his fourth government shake-up in 17 months _
was met with more dismay than shock. Even former allies accused him
of playing politics at the expense of the increasingly fragile
authority of Russia's central government.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this smacks very much of the agony and madness of the
Kremlin, and it is all hard to explain,'' said Boris Nemtsov, a
former member of Yeltsin's team who himself was once tapped briefly
as a potential heir. ``The only explanation that comes to mind is
that Yeltsin does not believe that Stepashin can be his successor
or thinks he is unworthy of being his successor.''
</P>
<P>
   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov was even more biting.
``Who will take any prime minister seriously if they are changed
like gloves?'' he asked in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
   Although Putin, 46, quickly sought to reassure the country, and
the current cabinet that he would make no changes, news of
Stepashin's abrupt dismissal caused a drop in the value of the
Russian ruble, and knocked down prices on Russia's stock exchange,
which in recent months had been rebounding from last August's
devastating financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As Muscovites openly voiced their disgust at the Kremlin's
latest game of musical chairs, Western governments and the
International Monetary Fund _ holders of Russia's mountain of debts
_ were more cautious, saying publicly that they were certain Moscow
would keep to its promised course.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin and later Putin reassured Russians that they intend to
have the nation's scheduled elections go ahead as planned. ``In one
year for the first time in the country's history the first
president of Russia will transfer power to a fresh, newly elected
president.'' Yeltsin said in a televised address to the nation.
``In any case he will be your president, respected Russians, he who
has won in honest and clean elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin, a former interior minister and faithful Yeltsin
supporter who was catapulted into the prime minister's job just
three months ago, was unexpectedly called to the Kremlin early
Monday morning and told he was being fired.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before, Stepashin had flown back to Moscow from the
southern province of Dagestan where he had been dispatched to
oversee an effort by federal forces to quell an armed rebellion by
Islamic extremists. Despite the timing, few experts think that
Stepashin's handling of the flare-up of violence in the volatile
north Caucuses was the immediate reason for Yeltsin's decision to
dismiss him.
</P>
<P>
   In his televised address to the nation, Yeltsin had no criticism
of Stepashin, but made it clear that the 47-year-old soft-spoken
former police officer had failed to qualify himself as a strong
presidential contender capable of keeping Yeltsin's foes at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Yeltsin praised Putin as ``the person capable of
consolidating society, the person who, basing himself on the
broadest political forces, is capable of ensuring a continuation of
reforms in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I trust him,'' said the president, who spoke slowly, looking
straight at the camera. ``But I also want all those who in July
2000 will come to the polling stations and make their choice to
have similar confidence in him. I think Putin will have enough time
to show his worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin on Monday also officially opened Russia's upcoming
election season, by signing a formal decree setting Dec. 19 for
regularly scheduled elections to the 450-seat lower house of the
parliament, or Duma. Presidential elections will follow in July
2000, when Yeltsin's second and final term comes to an end,
according to the Russian constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's anointment of Putin on Monday was another confirmation
that the battle over who will lead Russia into the post-Yeltsin era
is already underway. An opening shot was fired last week not by the
presidential administration, but by Moscow's ambitious Mayor Yuri
Luzhkov, and a handful of regional governors who formed an
electoral alliance in defiance of the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   That alliance, which many believe will attract former Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov back into politics, ultimately as a
presidential candidate, may have triggered Yeltsin's abrupt move
Monday. For several days, Russian newspapers have speculated that
the president would cast about for ways to regain the political
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's nomination must now be confirmed by the Duma, which is
scheduled to return from vacation and take its first vote on the
new prime minister next Monday. If it votes three times against the
president's candidate, the Russian constitution says it must be
disbanded. Since a majority of parliamentary deputies don't want to
lose their seats and privileges before the December elections, most
analysts expect that Putin _ like Stepashin before him _ will be
approved.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, having been through this drill repeatedly
during the Yeltsin presidency, attempted to play down the
significance of the Russian leader's latest government shake-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should blow this out of proportion,'' said
James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman. ``We have focused
our policy on the policies of Russian reform and the policies of
the Russian government, not the personalities.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added, . ``We do have some experience with Mr. Putin and
have a constructive relationship with him.''

MOSCOW: with him.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Putin, a former KGB agent who spent years in Germany during the
Cold War era, came to Moscow in 1996 from St. Petersburg where he
had served as first vice mayor to Mayor Anatoli Sobchak, one of the
leaders of Russia's early democratic movement. He served as
Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff and since last year as head of
Russia's internal intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kremlin, where his most recent job was secretary to the
Security Council, he has maintained a low-profile but has a
reputation as a tough administrator, whose power lies largely in
his continuing command of the domestic branch of the old KGB.
</P>
<P>
   Like Stepashin, Putin has no direct experience in electoral
politics and his cool, aloof manner sets him apart from Russia's
other more loquacious politicians. But analysts here suggest that
he was favored for the role of presidential aspirant because he may
be more ready than his predecessor to use his office to bring
Russia's powerful regional leaders in line behind the Kremlin's
election strategy.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Russia's governors, who hold executive power in the country's 89
regions, have become an increasingly powerful force on the national
political scene, as Moscow takes stock of their considerable
influence on voters back home, through local media, budgets and
their hold on local businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin, named prime minister in May after Yeltsin fired
Primakov, had tried to stay out of partisan politics, even as
Yeltsin's inner circle _ which includes his chief of staff
Aleksandr Voloshin and his youngest daughter Tatyana Dyachenko _
spent the summer picking fights with that part of the Russian media
that has cast its lot with Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   In a telling interview given to the newspaper Izvestia last
Friday, Stepashin pledged to keep a neutral role in the upcoming
election battles, which may not have been the message the Kremlin
wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even if he proves to be a more effective political player, few
observers Monday gave Putin a real chance to become a viable
presidential candidate, given the depth of popular antipathy to his
mentor. For more than a year now, Yeltsin's own popularity rating
has been in the single digits, as broad swaths of the Russian
population _ from disgruntled pensioners to disgusted entrepreneurs
_ blame him for the country's economic stagnation and rampant
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``A recommendation by Mr. Yeltsin, this is the kiss of death,''
said Leonid Dobrokhotov, an adviser to Zyuganov, the Communist
Party leader.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the universal loathing of him in the country, any
recommendation by him of any politician, even the best, points the
way to the grave,'' Dobrokhotov said. ``We are on the finishing
line of the Yeltsin regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Anatoly Chubais, a leader of a new right-wing party made up
of top liberal reformers, was quoted by one news agency source
Monday as saying that Stepashin's removal was ``a very risky step
with possible grave political consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As he demonstrated Monday, Yeltsin is still willing to wield the
considerable power vested in his office to try to turn the
political tide. As in the hard-fought election campaign of 1996, he
and his administration can still use or withhold money from the
federal budget to reward or punish wayward regional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But some politicians say that even these powers have diminished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two, three years ago, he had these opportunities, and he used
those opportunities,'' said Vladimir Ryzhkov, a parliamentary
leader in the Our Home is Russia Party, during a television
appearance last week. ``What has happened in these days has proved
one thing: Mr. Yeltsin's power has run out. The Russian
establishment, or at least its upper layer, has turned away from
Yeltsin.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts here are divided over Yeltsin's motives. Some argue
that he is intent on bequeathing to Russia, as his parting legacy,
a government and a president who are committed to completing the
country's transformation into a functioning democracy, with a
market-based economy. The rise of a Primakov-Luzhkov team, backed
by a coalition made up of Soviet-era industrial directors and some
of Russia's more autocratic governors, is seen by Yeltsin's circle
as a threat to those goals.
</P>
<P>
   But others see Yeltsin as a lame-duck politician who is
desperately struggling to guarantee his immunity, and that of his
family, once he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is in a state of panic,'' said Dobrokhotov. ``He is not
concerned about his legacy, or about Russia and its fate.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dobrokhotov said Yeltsin is afraid of ``a Ceausescu scenario,''
referring to the summary execution in December 1989 of Romania's
despised communist dictator, ``of being forced to pay the bill for
the terrible crisis he has put the country through.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as some caution, a year is a long time in Russian
politics where alliances and promises can evaporate as quickly as
they are made. And Yeltsin's renewed activity suggests that he will
do his best to win back control of political events.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Berezovsky, a prominent financier and media magnate whose
influence in the Kremlin rose after the fall of his arch-foe,
Primakov, suggested in an interview Monday with the news agency
Interfax that Yeltsin's strategy has not yet been fully laid out.
</P>
<P>
   According to Berezovsky, the dismissal of Stepashin is part of
the Kremlin's plan to ``create their own political force capable of
fighting for parliament.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The next two or three weeks will clarify the reasons for this
decision,'' he said.

IN AFRICA, A SMALL STEP TO BIGGER GAME PARKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 15)  
(yn) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ One of the dreams of the creators
of African game parks is to tear down national borders and let the
animals roam freely so that migration habits and grazing patterns
determine a park's boundaries. Naturally, politics gets in the way,
whether it's the politics of cartographers in the Colonial Office
during Victoria's reign, or the touchy border disputes of modern
African states.
</P>
<P>
   In April, South Africa and Botswana announced that they had
agreed to make one of those dreams come closer to reality. They
signed an agreement to jointly manage two parks contiguous to each
other, the Gemsbok National Park in Botswana and the Kalahari
Gemsbok National Park in far northwestern South Africa. The
combined park, 14,000 square miles in size (about as big as
Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island combined), will be
called the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park (pronounced
kuh-HAHL-uh-HOD-ee, the name is an attempt to get closer than
``Kalahari'' to the original word for ``place of thirst'' used by
the San people, or Bushmen).
</P>
<P>
   Each of the two parks will still run its own affairs and build
its own tourist facilities, but they will adhere to a master plan.
They will share entrance fees equally but keep the money they earn
from renting out chalets and camp sites.
</P>
<P>
   The two parks have operated largely as one since the Botswana
park was founded in 1938 (the South African one was founded in
1931). There is no fence. The border is the dry bed of the Nossob
River, which is up to half a mile wide in some places; the road
going along it meanders back and forth between the two countries.
The parks are remote; just to drive to the entrance from
Johannesburg or Gabarone, Botswana, 400 to 600 miles, can take two
days.
</P>
<P>
   The wildlife, which includes just about everything except
elephants, giraffes and zebra, is concentrated in the Nossob and
Auob riverbeds. Between them are the rust-red Kalahari dunes. The
area gets about eight inches of rain a year and is classified as
semi-desert, but the rains are unpredictable, so the antelopes and
the predators that follow them wander great distances for water and
grass.
</P>
<P>
   Government and private groups have long envisioned cross-border
parks. Perhaps the closest is the Limpopo Valley Peace Park, which
would combine bits of the area where South Africa, Zimbabwe and
Botswana meet. South Africa is already developing a new park in the
area, the Vembe-Dongola Park. It has some land and some animals,
according to Salifou Diddo, a spokesman for the South African
National Parks, but no overnight or eating facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to acquire more farmland, encourage indigenous
vegetation and move in animals from other parks. If the park is
created, it will still be split by the Limpopo River (that ``great
gray-green greasy Limpopo'' of the Rudyard Kipling story ``How the
Elephant Got Its Trunk''), so the border will still exist.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe has parkland on its own side, but is afflicted by
severe economic problems. Its currency has plummeted in the last
two years and people are suffering from huge increases in the price
of food and gasoline, so parkland is one of the government's lowest
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The most ambitious dream is to amalgamate South Africa's crown
jewel, Kruger National Park, with the Banhine and Zinave National
Parks in Mozambique and Gonarezhou National Park in Zimbabwe into a
megapark of 36,000 square miles, bigger than Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   But that is a long way off. Mozambique is one of the poorest
countries in the world, and the relative wealth of South Africa is
as big a draw to illegal immigrants as the United States is in
Central America. There is a barbed-wire fence along the border; it
used to be electrified, with the voltage set to kill. It's switched
off now, but the military still patrols the fence.
</P>
<P>
   More ominously, some immigrants who do slip through are hunted
down by Kruger lion prides. Lions who develop a taste for human
flesh then must be killed by Kruger rangers for fear that they will
put tourists on their menu. One dissected lion was found with a
purse containing Mozambican currency in his stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Mozambique is too poor to mount serious poaching patrols.
Its last rhinoceros was said to have been shot from a Cuban
helicopter during the 1980s civil war; there used to be a small
cross-border park on its southern border with South Africa, but
many elephants that went north using an old riverbed migration
route never came back, so South Africa closed the border there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd need some security that, if we took the fence down, it
wouldn't be open season on our animals,'' Diddo said.

CAMPING ON PRINCE EDWARD I  
 NASHVILLE'S CAROUSEL  
 CD-ROM MAPS OF EUROPE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 15) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RAY CORMIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Marialisa Calta's article about New Brunswick, ``In
Canada, a Resort Town by a Bay'' (June 27), implied she camped on
Prince Edward Island. Could she recommend a family campground on
the north shore? _ Karen Reidy, Trumbull, Conn.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. Ms. Calta did indeed camp on Prince Edward Island and she
recommends the three Prince Edward Island National Park campgrounds
_ Cavendish, Rustico Island and Stanhope _ and Cabot Beach
Provincial Park.
</P>
<P>
   The best national park area for children is probably Stanhope,
since it is not only close to beaches but also has a playground and
open areas. Cavendish is on the beach but no fires are allowed
there, according to Marc Ampleman, a park spokesman, and Rustico
Island is more isolated.
</P>
<P>
   Green Gables Golf Course is in the park and there are tennis
courts there and at Brackley. The park stages special events _
puppet shows, games and races, and nature walks _ at various sites
all summer. Many of these are free; call (902) 894-4246 for
information.
</P>
<P>
   The rates at Stanhope and Cavendish, which are open till Sept.
26, are $11.35 to $14 a night, and at Rustico, which closes Aug.
30, $10 to $11.35, at $1.50 Canadian to the dollar. A family pass
to enter the park is $4.65 a day; individual passes are $1 to $2.
For reservations, call (800) 414-6765.
</P>
<P>
   Cabot Beach Provincial Park, in Malpeque, (902) 836-8945, has a
playground, children's programs, a baseball field, guided nature
walks and supervised swimming in Malpeque Bay. There are 10 hot
showers, laundry facilities and a campers' store at the campground,
which closes Sept. 18. Rates are $10 to $13.35.
</P>
<P>
   There are also private camping areas on the north shore. These
generally offer more amenities, like restaurants and miniature
golf. For example, Marco Polo Land is a 100-acre site on Route 13
in Cavendish, a mile from the beach. It has two heated pools, a
tennis court, a game room with pool tables and a store.
</P>
<P>
   There are five washrooms with toilets and hot and cold showers.
Of its 500 camping sites, 242 have water, electrical and sewage
hookups. These cost $14 to $17.50 plus tax for up to four people,
or $86 to $106 a week. Marco Polo Land is open till mid-October;
(800) 665-2352.
</P>
<P>
   Vacationland Travel Park at Brackley Beach, about three miles
from Brackley Bay, has 300 sites on 30 acres. All have electricity
and water hookups, and cost $14.75 a night, tax included (one night
free if you stay a week). There are 12 hot showers, a heated pool,
miniature golf and bingo. Closes mid-September; (800) 529-0066.
</P>
<P>
   More information on campgrounds and tourism in the province is
available from the Island Information Service, Post Office Box
2000, Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada C1A 7N8; (888)
734-7529; www2.gov.pe.ca. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)I would like to take my family to see the carousel
designed by Red Grooms in Nashville. Do you know of any weekend
specials for hotels and air fares this fall? _ Marilyn Capaldi, New
York, N.Y.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. The fanciful Tennessee Fox Trot Carousel created by the
artist Red Grooms, a Nashville native, opened downtown in
Riverfront Park, Broadway at First Avenue, last November. On this
merry-go-round, rather than horses, you ride people _ hand-painted
icons out of Tennessee's past: Davy Crockett, Andrew Jackson, the
country singer Kitty Wells, the Olympic athlete Wilma Rudolph and
32 others.
</P>
<P>
   The carousel costs $2 a ride. It is open, weather permitting, 11
a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday to Saturday and noon to 6 on Sunday. For
information, contact the Nashvile Convention and Visitors Bureau,
161 Fourth Avenue North, Nashville, Tenn. 37219; (615) 259-4700,
fax (615) 254-6278; www.nashvillecvb.com.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau can book hotel rooms for Thursday to Sunday at
discounted rates of $59 to $109, according to Terry Clements, the
director of visitor development. It also offers a book of discount
coupons for attractions, dining and lodging.
</P>
<P>
   Clements said that he did not know of any airline deals, but
noted that Nashville is served by Southwest Airlines, the discount
carrier, (800) 435-9792; www.southwest.com. Southwest has seven
flights a day to Nashville from Islip, N.Y., for as low as $162
round trip, so starting your trip with a 50-mile drive to Long
Island will probably save you money. Other airlines serving
Nashville include American, TWA and United. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Are there CD-ROM maps for European cities and
country routes similar to Microsoft's Streets USA? _ Joseph F.
Boyle, Nanticoke, Pa.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. It turns out that Microsoft makes such a product _ the Auto
Route Express Europe 2000 CD-ROM, covering 45 countries from
Ireland to the Urals and 1.7 million miles of roads. It allows a
traveler to plan customized trips, search for destinations and
print out maps and directions. It can also be used with a global
positioning system to determine your location.
</P>
<P>
   It requires an operating system of Windows 95 or later or
Windows NT Workstation 4.00, and minimums of 16 megabytes (32
recommended) of RAM, 85 MB of hard-disk space and a double speed
CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   For England, Scotland and Wales, you could choose Microsoft's
Auto Express Great Britain. Rob McIntosh, international products
manager for Microsoft, said the Britain program includes all
streets in every city, whereas the Europe program does not show
some small streets.
</P>
<P>
   These products, however, are also difficult to find in America,
he said. You can seek information at www.microsoft.com/uk or
(44-345) 002-000. Elstead Maps, a British mail-order company, also
carries the products, and at a discount. The list price for each is
about $95, at $1.59 to the pound, but Elstead sells them for about
$79, plus $8 shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Elstead also carries a Dutch product, the AND Route 99 World!
CD-ROM, which maps everywhere but Antarctica. It does not offer as
much detail as Auto Route Express 2000, according to Stephen
Colebrooke of Elstead, but does provide printable optimum and
alternative routes and multiple-destination trips. It is about $67.
Contact Elstead at (44-1252) 703-472, fax (44-1252) 703-971, or
www.elstead.co.uk.
</P>
<P>
   The Eartha Global Explorer by Delorme of Yarmouth, Maine, (207)
846-7000, www.delorme.com, is another world atlas, showing major
highways and streets. It can plan trips by mass transit and be used
with a GPS receiver. Cost: $39.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ On the northwestern outskirts of Beijing there once
existed a vast, enchanting playground of imperial halls and
gardens, artificial lakes and even a cluster of rococo palaces
designed by European Jesuits in the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   Before it was sacked by British and French troops in 1860 _ to
the continuing outrage and shame of the Chinese _ the 870-acre
estate included more than a thousand bridges, re-creations of
China's finest landscapes and, for royal amusement, a make-believe
town populated by eunuchs. The emperors who had this fantasy land
built named it Yuanmingyuan _ the Garden of Perfect Brightness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been an imperial pleasure-ground that can
surpass it,'' the Emperor Qianlong wrote in 1742.
</P>
<P>
   Its plunderers agreed. ``You can scarcely imagine the beauty and
magnificence of the palaces we burnt,'' Capt. Charles Gordon of the
British army wrote after watching the orgy of looting.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the remnants of what is known in English as the Old
Summer Palace are the subject of an angry debate in Beijing, with
clashing visions of how to commemorate the past and a battle of
esthetic sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   This debate, being carried on in private meetings and in the
press, pits those who want to recreate the splendors of the former
estate as a for-profit tourist attraction against those who believe
in the quiet power of ruins. It is especially emotional because
this onetime imperial headquarters is so freighted with
nationalistic baggage.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1860, during the Second Opium War, when colonial
powers forced trade terms on China fostering the opium trade, a
British-French force razed the grounds in reprisal for China's
execution of allied prisoners. Stoked by history textbooks and
government propaganda, anger over the ransacking of the Old Summer
Palace still sizzles.
</P>
<P>
   The ruins are ``the most palpable symbol of the near-century of
national humiliation that the country experienced,'' said Geremie
R. Barme, an expert on Chinese culture at Australian National
University. More than once this spring, Chinese condemning what
they say was NATO's perfidy in the bombing of the Chinese Embassy
in Belgrade drew parallels with the fate of the Old Summer Palace.
</P>
<P>
   But today, its hallowed grounds have by universal agreement
become a monument to a different kind of national disgrace. Over
the years, large areas were taken over by farmers, squatters,
garbage dumps and more recently a State Council Guest House and a
fancy villa development. The portion salvaged in a public park
includes tacky carnival games, a dismal zoo and an island given
over to a ``Primitive People's Totem Park.''
</P>
<P>
   The only overt reminder of former glory is the sector of the
Western-style palaces, which were built of stone that survived the
conflagration. There, amid chaotic rubble, some walls have been
partly saved or restored, providing the standard backdrop for
photographs by visitors _ mostly Chinese who, as they climb through
the ruins, often shake their heads muttering phrases like ``What a
terrible thing they did'' or ``It was so beautiful, and they
destroyed it.''
</P>
<P>
   A decades-old debate over the future of the estate has flared
anew with the proposal by a well-connected real-estate developer
and fast-food king to re-create many of the palaces and landscapes
on a for-profit basis.
</P>
<P>
   The developer, Chen Liqun, 44, insists that the past would be
honored by restoring the grounds to their original splendor. He
says he would add a selection of ethnic restaurants and other
``appropriate'' activities. To help bring in tourists he might
also, he said, want to use part of the original estate for an
``Eastern Disneyland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced that the Old Summer Palace will be reborn and
once again shine in the eyes of the world,'' Chen said at the
Beijing headquarters he built for his company, Million Land House
Group _ a melange of ornate European styles with a large statue of
a sword-wielding knight in shining armor out front, meant to
symbolize the entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   ``By rebuilding what was once lost, we can also stimulate
domestic demand and economic development,'' Chen said. He figures
that much of the original estate could be re-created for about $250
million, part of which he would put up, while the rest he would
raise by selling shares to ethnic Chinese the world over. He says
he would concentrate on the former Chinese palaces and landscapes,
leaving the European-style stone ruins alone for now.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's proposal is certainly in keeping with tradition in China,
which has a mania for building replicas or totally restoring
historical sites like the Great Wall. Wu Hung, a Chinese-born art
historian at the University of Chicago, notes that the Chinese have
generally not shared the passion of Westerners for architectural
ruins as esthetically and historically meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   But Chen's and other similar proposals have infuriated a range
of cultural historians, archeologists and architects here, who say
an ersatz theme park would debase the site's historical
significance.
</P>
<P>
   These critics say the historical and patriotic meaning of the
Old Summer Palace lies more in its destruction than in its original
form. They argue for transforming it into an outdoor museum and
much of the remaining area devoted to quiet greens and lakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``These ruins have their own esthetic validity,'' said Qin
Youguo, dean of architecture at Qinghua University in Beijing.
``These ruins were a witness to events in history. That's why they
are important.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ruins provide a space for contemplation, they give people time
to think,'' Qin said. He asked rhetorically whether the Venus de
Milo would be improved by re-attaching her arms.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   ``To restore the ruins of the Old Summer Palace would be
tantamount to faking a `beautiful' product,'' another opponent, Ye
Tingfang, a professor of literature at the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences, said in a recent article. ``Ruins are also a kind
of beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   The developer, Chen, though, has the support of some historians
as well as several local officials who, among other things, may
welcome an expensive new construction project.
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Chen says he is confident that the rebuilding can begin within
the next year or two. But no one seems sure which of many
overlapping government agencies has the power _ or the nerve _ to
make a binding decision. For now, all the two sides agree on is
that something must be done.

   A MATURING SERVICE www.expedia.com
</P>
<P>
   Expedia, the travel Web site, has been revamped with additional
and improved features. The new look is bright and as clean as the
fullness of the pages allows.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new features are Fare Compare, Modify Search, and
E-Mail Itineraries. For Fare Compare, you choose from a list of
major airports and give the earliest date you might leave. The site
searches for the lowest fares Expedia's 6.3 million members have
actually paid, not just the lowest published fares, which are also
available.
</P>
<P>
   Modify Search, simply means that you can change the terms of a
search, like the departure date, at any time rather than backing up
to the page where you entered the terms. E-Mail Itineraries lets
you send your itinerary to the people who have to know what you are
up to.
</P>
<P>
   These may be minor conveniences, and there are many more
additions and upgrades, but as the Web matures, such minor
conveniences are the main things that separate one site from
another.
</P>
<P>
   You can use Expedia without being a member, although there is no
membership fee; only your name and e-mail address are required.
When booking time comes, of course, a credit card number must be
given. Expedia covers a customer's liability up to $50, where the
credit card company's protection usually kicks in, if the card is
used without authorization on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the expected travel services _ booking flights,
reserving rooms, shopping for cruises, resorts, sports _ in May,
Expedia inaugurated a separate expanded section for business
travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, it connects to Mileage Miner, a service that
keeps track of frequent-traveler accounts. And early last month,
Expedia followed up with a section with ``family friendly'' travel
deals and articles with tips on keeping the kids happy, or at least
bearable, on a journey.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Expedia was formerly MSN Expedia; the name has
changed, but it remains a Microsoft company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ALL THE BASICS travel.yahoo.com
</P>
<P>
   Most of the basic travel services offered by Expedia are also
available on Yahoo Travel, a dedicated travel site spun off from
the popular Yahoo search engine. You can reserve airline seats at
the lowest published fares, hotel rooms and rental cars, find deals
and link to thousands of other sites.
</P>
<P>
   You can also learn about tipping etiquette in the Third World,
dress codes in obscure destinations and where to swim with
dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Destinations can be searched by activities or by such
``Lifestyles,'' as Yahoo calls them, as Jewish, senior or
vegetarian.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo Travel has a chummier, chattier feel than Expedia. But the
most important factor in finding and booking trips on line is
getting comfortable with the service. Both Expedia and Yahoo Travel
are well designed.

   By the River Thames, A Place for Toasting
</P>
<P>
   For those who enjoy wine and would like to learn more of its
history, a new attraction in London, Vinopolis _ City of Wine, is
the place to go. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Financed by 500 private investors, the two-and-a-half-acre site
under vaulted arches at Southwark Bridge on the South Bank of the
Thames is the brainchild of the London wine merchant Duncan
Vaughn-Arbuckle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An audiocassette tour, the Wine Odyssey, takes visitors through
displays focusing on the world's winegrowing regions, starting in
Georgia, where wine was first made 7,000 years ago. Among the
tour's highlights are silver-encased vine cuttings and
8,000-year-old vessels from Georgia; a simulated ride aboard a
Vespa through the towns and countryside of Italy's wine regions,
and an elevator trimmed in bubbles that goes to a mezzanine level
devoted to Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Touch-screen computers throughout the tour provide information
on wine, including which to drink with which foods. The tour can
take up to four hours.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Wine Odyssey ends in the Grand Tasting Hall, where, included
in the admission fee of about $16, visitors can taste five premium
wines from around the world. Five more samples can be bought for
about $4. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other features include the Vinopolis Vaults, where 1,000 wines,
glassware, books and other items are for sale. Four restaurants
designed by two leading London restaurateurs, Claudio Pulze and
Trevor Gulliver, will eventually open; the first, seating 70
people, opened this month.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, a permanent art gallery opens, featuring works from
the contemporary art collection of Donald Hess, who founded The
Hess Collection Winery in Napa Valley. The first exhibition will
feature 27 woodcuts and large paintings by the Swiss artist Franz
Gertsch. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vinopolis _ City of Wine, 1 Bank End, London, is open daily.

   Following Shackleton, In Far More Comfort &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marine Expeditions, one of the largest operators of voyages to
the Antarctic and the Arctic, is offering a 21-day trip this fall
that retraces Sir Ernest Shackleton's foray to Antarctica in 1914. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His attempt to be the first man to lead an exploration party
across Antarctica failed when he and his crew were halted in the
Weddell Sea by the onset of a cold snap that locked their ship in
ice and they were forced to abandon it.
</P>
<P>
   The crew endured treacherous sea voyages, frostbitten crossings
of unmapped mountain ranges and months adrift on floating pack ice,
but every man who set sail survived. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Passengers on the Marine Expeditions trip will arrive in Buenos
Aires and fly to Ushuaia on the southern tip of South America.
There, they will board the 235-foot Marine Spirit and head for
Antarctica and the South Shetland Islands, Paulet Island and the
Erebus and Terror Gulf following the route of Shackleton. The ship
will stop at Elephant Island to see where Shackleton's party first
made landfall.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers will hike on the Antarctic mainland, visit whaling
stations and see majestic ice floes. Lectures will focus on the
original voyage and ongoing oceanography, glaciology and
climatology. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Shackleton, Sir Ernest's cousin, will share excerpts of
the explorer's diaries. Adelie and Alice Hurley, daughters of the
original expedition's photographer, Frank Hurley, will also be on
the cruise. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The trip is scheduled for Nov. 23 to Dec. 13. Prices per person
in double occupancy range from $5,595 to $7,895, plus tax. Air fare
is included from New York and Miami. Information: (800) 263-9147 or

   Hovering Over Alaska To Get Close to Wildlife
</P>
<P>
   Kruegers Wildife Alaskan Adventures in Soldotna, Alaska, is
offering visitors a chance to board ecologically friendly
hovercraft and explore remote, shallow rivers that are the habitats
of bears, wolves, moose, salmon and 129 species of birds.
</P>
<P>
   These vessels, which fly about eight inches above the water, are
frequently used by companies and government agencies, but they had
not been available to tourists in Alaska until various governmental
agencies approved their use this summer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the Kruegers' trips, up to nine participants meet at the
Nikiski Airport in Kenai, a two-and-a-half-hour drive south of
Anchorage. There, they board a five-passenger plane and fly about a
half-hour to Blockade Glacier on the west side of the Cook Inlet,
then ride four-passenger hovercraft up and down the McArthur and
Chakachatna Rivers. The hovercraft can stop at various spots to let
passengers explore on foot.
</P>
<P>
   The four-hour trips are offered year-round, with winter
activities including cross-country skiing and snowmobiling.
</P>
<P>
   The excursion costs $349 a person, including round-trip air fare
from Nikiski Airport. Contact Kruegers Alaskan Wild Adventures,
Post Office Box 3198, Soldotna, Alaska 99669; (907) 262-2538.

   The Age of the Pharaohs Dawns Again at the Met
</P>
<P>
   Egypt comes to Manhattan in a big way this fall when the
Metropolitan Museum of Art presents ``Egyptian Art in the Age of
the Pyramids'' beginning Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   With 250 works borrowed from more than 30 museums in Egypt,
Europe and North America, the exhibition focuses on Dynasties 3
through 6, about 2650 B.C. to 2150 B.C. This was a time when
semidivine kings like Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure ruled and the
famous pyramids were built for them in Giza.
</P>
<P>
   The sculptures and decorative objects of the period, created for
use in the temples and tombs around the pyramids, are considered to
be the first truly great examples of Egyptian art.
</P>
<P>
   The show features a painted limestone stele from the tomb of
Wep-em-nefret, a prince and priest who lived during the reign of
Khufu (2551 to 2528 B.C.); a monumental seated statue of Hemiunu,
the probable architect of the Great Pyramid at Giza; four ``reserve
heads,'' enigmatic sculptures that are thought to be idealized
portraits of their owners; and a limestone statue of Kai, a
powerful vizier in the late-2400s B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Some objects, like four statues of an official named Nikare and
a set of five relief sculptures from the tomb of a noble named
Metjetji, are reunited for the first time since excavation in the
first half of this century. Others, like a seated statue of a dwarf
named Per-ni-ankhu carved from basalt and four limestone statuettes
of a royal acquaintance named Inty-shedu, are recent finds.
</P>
<P>
   Arranged chronologically, the exhibition incorporates recent
research that redated some objects, thus presenting them in a new
context.
</P>
<P>
   The Met is also showing tools used in the construction of the
pyramids and a facing stone from the Great Pyramid, as well as
several scale models illustrating the period's architecture.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition will remain on view until Jan. 9, then travel to
the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, Feb. 13 to May 22.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Museum of Art, is open daily except Monday.
Suggested admission is $10. Information: (212) 535-7710 or on the
Web at www.metmuseum.org.

 &HT;    PROJECTED BUDGET SURPLUSES A MIRAGE, GROUP SAYS
 &HT;    410&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton and congressional Republicans
face off over how to spend the projected budget surplus, a
Washington research group said Monday there may be little, or no,
extra money to haggle over.
</P>
<P>
   As things look now, the federal budget is likely to remain about
$20 billion in the red next year, the Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities estimated.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a $34 billion swing from the $14 billion surplus
the Congressional Budget Office projects, and a $25 billion shift
from the White House estimates of a $5 billion surplus for the next
budget year.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, it means the 10-year, $1-trillion surplus
that the White House and congressional Republicans are battling
over how to spend may never materialize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the trillion-dollar surplus is not real,'' said Robert
Greenstein, executive director of the budget center.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he said, is that rosy budget projections assume
that spending limits agreed upon in 1997 will be met. To hit those
targets, Greenstein said, federal spending will have to be cut a
whopping $775 billion over the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, Greenstein said, that's wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither party has the stomach for deep cuts,'' Greenstein said
in a telephone interview. ``The notion of $775 billion over 10
years in cuts is utterly unreal.''
</P>
<P>
   At best, he said, Republicans and Democrats might be expected to
hold future spending at this year's levels, plus a slight annual
increase to keep up with inflation.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of discipline, combined with continued economic growth
topping 2 percent a year, would result in perhaps $112 billion in
federal budget surpluses over the coming 10 years _ just over
one-tenth of the $1 trillion level projected by the White House and
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans want to give most of that _ $792 billion _ back
to taxpayers in the form of a tax cut. Clinton has said he'll go
along with a tax cut of no more than $300 billion, though he's
signaled a willingness to compromise at a higher level.
</P>
<P>
   But that debate misses the point, said Greenstein, because the
surplus is, so far, ``a mirage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It only materializes if Congress and the White House make
decisions they have not yet made to cut programs they have not yet
cut,'' said Greenstein, who said his center plans to publish a
report on the issue later this week. ``The evidence, it gets
clearer every day, is that these cuts aren't going to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the 1997 balanced budget agreement, Congress
is required by law to remain within certain spending ceilings, or
caps, in most areas of discretionary spending. That excludes
mandatory payments such as Social Security, Medicare and other
``entitlement'' programs guaranteed by law.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting those caps, said Greenstein, will require cuts amounting
to an average $78 billion a year over the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't likely to happen, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the partisan squabbling over the budget for fiscal 2000,
which begins Oct. 1, Greenstein said that budget ``gimmicks'' are
being used by both parties to give the appearance of a surplus when
none is likely to exist.
</P>
<P>
   For example, congressional budgeteers have labeled as
``emergency'' spending _ exempt from the statutory budget caps _
$11 billion worth of planned spending that Greenstein said should
be part of the regular budget. The money is going to fund the 2000
census and farm subsidies, neither of which are surprises.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, he said, Congress is low-balling spending in
several key areas _ defense and transportation among them _ that
the Congressional Budget Office estimates will actually cost
taxpayers $14 billion more than politicians now claim.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in an estimated $8 billion in revenues forgone by
Republican-proposed changes in taxes and fees, said Greenstein, and
a few other variances, and the meager surplus being projected for
next year turns into a deficit.

&HT;        IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE TO HIRE MORE COPS UNDER CLINTON PLAN,
MAYOR DECIDES
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Aug. 9, -- Philadelphia can't afford to participate
again in President Clinton's program to put more police officers on
the street, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Ed Rendell has decided he won't apply for assistance under
Clinton's Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) matching
grant program because it would cost the city too much to pay its
portion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor feels it won't be financially possible to hire any
more officers under that program,'' said. Lt. Susan Slawson, a
spokeswoman for the Philadelphia police department. ``Our budget
just doesn't allow for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's cost for the 753 officers already hired under the
program since 1995 will reach $44 million a year by 2002, when the
federal assistance runs out. Under the block grant program, the
costs to local police departments over time rise from 25 percent to
100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a significant chunk of money,'' said Rendell's
spokesman Kevin Feeley. ``It's a major concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, the city's police department budget has grown almost
30 percent from $299.9 million to $388 million in 2000, Feeley
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we have taken full advantage of the program,''
Feeley said. ``At the moment, the budget doesn't call for us to ask
for more federal help. It is a terrific partnership, just not one
we can afford right now or at least in the next few years.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, Clinton's program reached its goal of adding 100,000 new
officers to the street. But the funding was scheduled to run out in
2000. The program offers block grants that pay up to 75 percent of
the cost of new officers' salaries and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Clinton proposed continuing and expanding the COPS
program by putting 30,000 to 50,000 more community policing
officers to the beat over the next five years -- at a cost of $600
million.
</P>
<P>
   Since Philadelphia isn't reapplying for grant money, it won't be
impacted by Congress' recent moves to cut back funding for the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as part of the annual budget battle, the House
proposed $268 million for the program. But the Senate asked for
$495 million in its version of the funding. Sen. Joseph Biden,
D-DE, has said he plans to introduce a bill that reauthorizes and
fully funds the President's request for hiring 50,000 more
officers.
</P>
<P>
   A conference committee will work out the differences in the
proposals when Congress returns in September.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has threatened to veto a bill that cuts the
program.

BAIL SET FOR HINDU PRIEST IN SEX CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn.: Ark.) 
 
By STEVE BREWER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Bail for a Hindu priest was set at $50,000 Monday on a
charge that surfaced after he was convicted and sentenced to
probation in June for the sexual assault of a Little Rock, Ark.,
woman.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Ted Poe set the bail at the request of
defense attorneys for Bhogeshwernand Sharma, 37. He must also post
an additional $10,000 bail before he can be released from jail
while appealing his conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Sharma was still in custody late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sharma was placed on 10 years probation June 23 for the April 3,
1998, sexual assault of the 21-year-old Arkansas woman, which took
place at his Harris County home. As part of that probation, Poe
ordered him to serve 180 days in jail.
</P>
<P>
   That woman said Sharma assaulted her when she and her mother
came to Houston to visit Sharma and his family. She said he bullied
her into sex under the pretext that it was a religious ritual to
``cleanse her womb.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman's mother and aunt testified that Sharma did the same
thing to them in Arkansas in September 1997. Sharma has not been
charged there, but the two women told their stories to jurors in
the 21-year-old's case in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the verdict in Sharma's case was announced,
prosecutors filed a new sexual assault charge against him.
</P>
<P>
   That charge alleges he sexually assaulted a 20-year-old Hindu
woman Jan. 6 in Houston _ days before he was charged with the April
1998 assault _ using the same ploy.
</P>
<P>
   Poe initially denied Sharma bail on the new charge, which meant
that once he had served notice of appeal in the case involving the
Arkansas woman he would not be credited for the 180 days in jail he
was serving as part of the probation.
</P>
<P>
   But his defense lawyers recently filed a lengthy motion seeking
bail. Poe, who had previously promised to review Sharma's bond
status, granted it.
</P>
<P>
   If Sharma makes bail, Poe said he must report to the court once
a week, wear an electronic monitor, surrender his passport and not
go to a passport office or airport. He cannot leave his house to
work unless his employment is verified, and he can't leave Harris
County, which includes most of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The travel and passport restrictions were imposed, in part,
because authorities say they believe Sharma tried to flee the
country after he was originally charged.
</P>
<P>
   If he is freed, Sharma will have to return to jail to serve the
180 days if his appeal fails, or if he is convicted and sentenced
to jail time on the new charge.
</P>
<P>
   The case involving the Houston woman has not been presented to a
grand jury yet. Prosecutors say they are waiting on physical
evidence.

<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ The marks of war are nearly
erased from Sarajevo. Sheets of glass have been fitted into the
high rises and the shell holes have been plastered over.
</P>
<P>
   The newly painted trolleys rumble nosily down the tracks of the
central boulevard Zmaja od Bosne, known during the war as Snipers
Alley. Water, a commodity once so precious that mothers dashed
under artillery fire to water trucks, gushes miraculously from the
taps.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bosnian capital, which held together a blend of Muslims,
Croats and Serbs, and hung on to life during almost four years of
siege by the Bosnian Serbs, has lost its sense of purpose, its
direction, and many say its soul. The smooth, plaster facades of
apartment blocks, painted purple, red, blue and yellow, shelter
people who, for the most part, survive on the beneficence of
others. Less than 20 percent of the inhabitants are native to the
city. The $5.1 billion international reconstruction effort, which
has physically mended Sarajevo, masks a despair that will take a
generation to vanquish.
</P>
<P>
   Men, out of work, often wounded physically or emotionally, waste
hours in dingy coffee shops. The young gather in the lines for
visas outside foreign embassies. At night they meet in jammed,
smoky clubs like Fis or The Stage where they can buy marijuana,
ecstasy and heroin. An army of war invalids lies trapped indoors.
Most of them lack proper medical attention, and many lie alone in
rooms, tended by elderly parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son is inside,'' said an angry 70-year-old man, who would
not give his name as he stood outside his small house fitting new
aluminum drainpipes to the roof. ``He can't get up. Every night my
wife has to go in and turn him over so he can go to the bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands in the city, where half the work force is jobless,
live in apartments that belong to someone else, someone who lives
across the ethnic divide, still a universe away in this partitioned
country. There remains a collective exhaustion and bewilderment
that makes routine life daunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never again be able to live such a strong, horrible and
wonderful life,'' said Boba Lizdek, 32, a book translator. ``My
world is no longer homogeneous. It is as if I see life through
pieces of a mirror that lies in fragments.''
</P>
<P>
   The suburb of Dobrinja, built as the athletes' village for the
1984 winter Olympics, was on the front line during the war, which
began in April 1992 when Serbian forces attacked the city and ended
in 1995 with the Dayton peace agreement. Sections of Dobrinja are
in ruins, the walls and roofs gone, the bricks and cement chewed up
by shell and bullet holes. There are crude grave markers poking up
at odd angles from tiny, overgrown parks and lonely patches of
ground.
</P>
<P>
   The renovated buildings, often next to the gutted remains, gleam
with spotless white plaster and terra cotta tiled roofs. The
balconies hold boxes of carnations. The streets are quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Murdija Badzic, 51, lives in a small second-floor apartment she
and her husband rebuilt for $10,000 a year ago. It is clean, with
new carpets, a semicircular blue sofa in the living room and
freshly painted walls.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1992 Serbian troops occupied this part of the city,
herding Mrs. Badzic and four of her eight children to a prison
camp. She was forced to walk barefoot. In that instant all the
mementos of her life, her photos, the children's favorite toys, the
wedding gifts and the collection of trinkets that remind couples of
the passage of time, vanished. The two-room apartment holds nothing
of the old life. The only photo on the wall is of her eldest son,
Husein, a soldier killed in the war.
</P>
<P>
   The couple live with their remaining two sons. The young men,
unemployed since the end of the war, have applied to emigrate to
the United States. When Mrs. Badzic spoke of the war, nervously
taking long drags on her cigarette, her youngest son, Aladin, 24,
abruptly left the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgive him,'' she said. ``He cannot talk about the war. He
cannot hear about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian soldiers during the two-week detention threatened
Aladin, who was 16, with mock executions. He was severely beaten.
He did not speak for two months following his release from the
camp.
</P>
<P>
   The young man, darkened to a chocolate brown after days on the
Croatian coast, had long hair, a silver bracelet and a Volkswagen
parked in front of the house. As his mother, her eyes wet, spoke,
he gunned his car and screeched off into the city center.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the siege he went to the morgue to pick up his elder
brother,'' she said. ``He came home and gave me a tranquilizer and
a packet of cigarettes. He told me what happened. I thought I would
not live another 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I drop a fork I jump,'' she said. ``Any noise makes me
fearful. We have two balconies on our apartment, but I cannot sit
on the one that faces the airport, the one that faces where the
Serbs had their guns. I still cannot look.''
</P>
<P>
   In the empty street below, Huso Kovac, 58, swung himself forward
with the help of hand-held aluminum crutches. He said he dislikes
spending days in his apartment, which previously belonged to a
Serb. He moves laboriously about the neighborhood, resting at times
on the cement walls and staring at the road.
</P>
<P>
   Kovac worked before the war in Sutjeska, the national park that
was the site of one of the most famous Partisan battles in World
War II. When he speaks of the yearly anniversaries of the battle,
which always saw the arrival of Tito, his eyes light up. It is the
only time he smiles.
</P>
<P>
   He lost his leg in 1993 as he and his Muslim neighbors fled from
Sutjeska over Mt. Igman to Sarajevo. He receives a pension of $100
a month. His only son died in the war. His daughter's husband was
also killed. She cares for their two small children alone on her
widow's pension.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't trust anyone anymore,'' he said. ``This is what the
war has taught me, not to trust.''
</P>
<P>
   He shifts his hands to grip the handles and moves away.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   The only Serbian enclave in the city is a rim of forlorn
buildings at the edge of Dobrinja. These buildings were not handed
over to the Muslim-led government under the Dayton peace agreement.
The wartime Bosnian Serb leaders, none of whom live here, have
christened the neighborhood the ``Serb Sarajevo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will go into the city to buy something, but I would never
stop to have a coffee,'' said Dalibor Bugarin, a 21-year-old Serb,
as a helicopter passed overhead. ``I do not feel comfortable. We
lost our house in Sarajevo and will never get it back. We just want
to get out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   But even for those minorities in the city, where more than 90
percent of the 350,000 people are Muslim, life is a constant battle
to abide by the politically correct version of the war. Nearly all
Croats and Serbs who once lived here, and who made up half of the
city's population, lost their apartments. Despite international
pressure, few have been able to return home. Mile Sadzak, 37, who
has a doctorate in economics, is unemployed. The city, where he was
born, is filled, he said, with outsiders, those who fled here from
villages razed by the Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are not a member of the ruling party you do not work,''
he said. ``There are thousands of us who walk the streets and do
nothing. The intellectuals have been pushed out of the new
nationalist system. I miss my friends. I miss the old city. I have
lost confidence. When we speak together we must think about what we
will say. Croats will only go to Croat doctors. Muslims will only
go to Muslim doctors. If a few of us Croats are together and a
Muslim friend comes over we fall silent. The mood changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lizdek sat in the late afternoon with her mother, Radmila,
in their small apartment. Her mother, a Serb, lost her parents and
four of her six brothers and sisters in World War II, the victims
of Muslim soldiers allied with the fascist Ustashe forces. As a
12-year-old girl, separated from her family in 1942, she joined
Tito's First Proletarian Brigade. She moved for three years through
the mountains in the fight against the Germans, affectionately
nicknamed ``Mala,'' or ``little girl,'' by the Communist
commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lizdek, 70, opened a book that held two dried flowers,
given to her daughter Boba by Tito and his wife, Jovanka, at the
1973 anniversary of Sutjeska. ``We were walking in a long column in
1942 when I saw a woman from my village,'' she said. ``She told me
my mother and brothers had been killed. I started to weep. The
column halted and the commander Moshe Pijade galloped over on his
horse. He asked what had happened. They told him Radmila's mother
and brothers were dead. He put me on the horse and told me to stop
crying. He said the proletariat does not cry; it sings. We began to
sing the Partisan song `Through the Forests and the Mountains.' The
whole column began to sing. This is how I survived the death of my
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   But the heroics and romance of the last war, so much a part of
her daughter's life, have been extinguished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived through two wars,'' said Ms. Lizdek, ``the virtual war
explained to me by my mother and the real war. I felt my mother's
war deeply as a little girl. I heard the idealized fiction of the
life before the war, the gardens, flowers, fruits of my
grandfather's home. War seemed a normal part of my life. ``I was
prepared for war. But I am fragile now. I did not need this
experience. My mother did not need this experience. She did not
need to lose her family. I only realize this now.''

CITING CONCERN OVER `MAD COW' DISEASE, CHINA BANS IMPORT OF FRENCH
WINE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France)   By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ In a move that baffles French officials and
businessmen, Chinese customs authorities have suspended the import
of all wine from, of all countries, France.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have also ordered retailers in many cities to
take French wine off the shelves of stores, where wine sales have
been growing fast in recent years. They cited reports that
vineyards in a few small provinces of southern France were ignoring
a ban on a by-product of bovine blood because of concern over the
possibility, however remote, of a connection with `mad cow'
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Yet French officials say China's ban on French wine looks like a
huge overreaction, since none of the vineyards have ever exported
wine anywhere, much less to China. No one is known to have fallen
ill from wine made with the by-product in question.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Chinese Customs are under pressure from domestic Chinese
wine producers to restrict imports, or whether Chinese Customs are
simply being unduly persnickety, remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six months, as domestic stockpiles of a whole range
of food and manufactured products have grown, China has banned a
variety of imports, including pigs from Madagascar, horses from
Zimbabwe and meat and dairy products from Belgium, the Netherlands,
France and Germany. China also banned all Dutch poultry, after a
single chick was found to have chicken plague.
</P>
<P>
   This time, as in other cases, Chinese authorities pointed to a
minor action taken by the government of another country as a
justification for its reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wine sealed by the French authority was reported to be
contaminated during the process of purification by the blood of a
cow,'' the China Daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said that health inspection bureaus in some
Chinese provinces had ordered that all sales of French wine halt
immediately while all wine imported from France has been taken off
the shelves of some large department stores.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Louis Porry, a senior French diplomat responsible for
agricultural affairs, said he was surprised by the ban because
French and Chinese officials were in the process of what he thought
was a simple procedure to certify that French wine imports were not
contaminated. Then the ban suddenly came down late last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand it at all,'' Porry said. ``This wine comes
from four small regions. This is only low-quality table wine, we
are quite sure that none of it was being exported.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, tenuous as it may sound, began two years ago when
Europe banned use of the bovine blood by-product as a purifying
agent in wine-making because of an outside chance that it could
pass on spongiform encephalopathy, commonly known as mad cow
disease.
</P>
<P>
   In June, French officials discovered that winemakers in four
small regions of southern France were still using the by-product.
But it affected less that 85,000 liters of wine out of 5.4 billion
liters that France produces each year, and no cases of infection
have been reported.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, China imported 5 million liters of wine from France
last year. Yet executives familiar with distribution say that, as
with countless other products, perhaps as much or more is also
smuggled into China to avoid the 118 per cent import duty.
</P>
<P>
   A French wine importer and distributor in Shanghai said that he
was confused by the new ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very surprising,'' he said. ``You can not export wine
from France that is contaminated. Wine is such an important export
that French Customs are extremely tough.''
</P>
<P>
   He also expressed concern that the ban would unfairly create a
negative impression of French wine in China, just as it is starting
to become popular.

<P>
   EASTHAM, Mass. _ It is only a summer fantasy, but such an
uplifting one. Transcendent; a tinge pagan; in a fancy word,
Thoreauvian.
</P>
<P>
   You are strolling along the salt-marsh path with Henry David
Thoreau, taking note of his well-worn walking stick and the
leisurely lilt in his step. The reeds issue a soprano hissing, the
water ripples busily and he turns to you and says:
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us spend one day _ one day! _ as deliberately as nature,
and not be thrown off the track by every nutshell and mosquito's
wing that falls on the rail!''
</P>
<P>
   He pulls his flute from the back pocket of his corduroys and
breathes some slow trills, and you float into contemplative
silence.
</P>
<P>
   Ahh. Anyone who finds such a momentary illusion sweeter than any
beach-season bestseller owes thanks to a retired high school
English teacher named David Barto, who has ``brought Henry,'' as he
puts it, for a summer on Cape Cod, lasting through Aug. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Eight times a week, for an hour or more, Barto, as Thoreau,
walks with visitors or presents lectures, never stepping out of
muslin-shirted character, always answering their questions from the
immense compendium of Thoreauviana he holds in his head.
</P>
<P>
   For such labor at the Salt Pond Visitors' Center of the Cape Cod
National Seashore and hereabouts, he receives $9 a day in meal
money from the National Park Service, and a room.
</P>
<P>
   An adjunct professor of composition at the University of Nevada
in Las Vegas during the school year, he paid his own plane fare to
get here, and does not know whether he will be able to afford to
return next summer. He can no longer afford a car, he said, but the
park service lends him a bike while he's here. And once, a kind
stranger who saw him ``footing it'' it on the road called, ``Hey,
Hank, would you like a lift?''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of historical sites have actors playing long-dead
characters brought back to life _ the Thomas Jefferson at
Williamsburg, the George Washington at Washington Crossing, Pa. On
stage, Hal Holbrooke does a famous Twain, of course. And a local
actor in Wellfleet _ the whole area is heavy Thoreau country
because of his posthumously published book, ``Cape Cod'' _ has
portrayed Thoreau in a set piece.
</P>
<P>
   But the special nature of Barto's unusual art is that it is
never a set piece. It is, to use the most anachronistic of terms,
interactive, never the same twice, dependent on what he happens to
see as he leads a group of tourists about, or what they ask. And it
is especially fragile in that, lacking a permanent gig as he does,
it depends almost entirely on his own enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Which is how it all began. One day, in 1974, Barto's 10th-grade
English class at Pennsbury High School in Lower Bucks County, Pa.,
seemed so bored as it read Thoreau that he thought to himself: the
only thing that would fire them up would be if Thoreau himself came
back from the dead to talk to them.
</P>
<P>
   Light bulb flash. At first, when he appeared in costume and
character, the students laughed at him, but by the end they were
asking him questions. And a few years later, when ``Henry'' talked
about the importance of following one's dream and living by one's
convictions, a whole class ended up in tears, Barto said. That day,
two student library aides who had heard the speech asked the
librarian if they could talk about life instead of filing.
</P>
<P>
   There were people who said ``You can't keep this to yourself,''
Barto said. He ended up ``bringing Henry'' to Walden Pond, in
Concord, Mass., and putting on programs there every summer from
1984 through 1996, until the money and his energy ran out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in my blood to be a teacher,'' he said, ``and being
Thoreau is like the highest form of teaching you can do. It's
immediate. There he is, standing there, and you can ask him
anything you want.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the best teachers _ perhaps especially the best
teachers _ burn out. After 25 years of long high school teaching
days, and a dozen years of squiring Henry around every summer,
Barto retired in 1996. Now, at 49, he is carrying out his plan to
live five different places in retirement: in a desert _ hence Las
Vegas _ at the seaside, on a farm, in the woods and in a city.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of rest, however, ``Henry'' could not stay
retired. Indeed, what a waste that would be: Barto knows so much
verbatim Thoreau he could recite it for at least two hours
straight, he said, and has it memorized by category, so that any
mention of sunrise or sea or dogs or civil disobedience can set him
off on that subject.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, though, he said, he is a teacher, and while the material
is well-worn to him, he still feels gratified when a listener
responds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly, I leave them with a sense of who this man was,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the listeners, some extol their time with Henry and
pepper him with questions; one commented on a recent morning, ``I
felt a couple of times as if we were all born way too late.'' And
Mike Whatley, the supervisory park ranger here, said attendance at
the Thoreau talks has been excellent. Two dozen listeners came one
recent perfect sunny morning, and another two dozen on an evening
walk Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Of Barto, Whatley said, ``He's an unusual character. He refuses
to step out of character when he's in it.'' But the Henry character
certainly works well, he said, and Thoreau was such a fine
naturalist that his Cape Cod book, about his travels here, is still
current in many ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to have him back next summer,'' Whatley said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, as summer wanes, Barto sets out many a morning
and evening leading tourists whose vacation torpor is broken by
bright-eyed memories of what it meant to read ``Walden'' the first
time. Or to first hear, ``If a man does not keep pace with his
companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let
him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Barto, while he is in character, why he does this and he
responds in his stentorian 19th-century tones: ``I am drawn. The
day when I am no longer drawn, I will sleep peaceably with my
family and friends in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery.''

BC ALUMNUS GIVES $5M TO SUPPORT RETREAT PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES BANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The son of devoutly religious parents, John A. McNeice
Jr. subscribes to the biblical adage: ``To whom much has been
given, much is expected.''
</P>
<P>
   The 66-year-old retired CEO of the Colonial Group made a fortune
in the mutual fund industry, and has spent much of his time giving
his money away _ a good portion of it going to Jesuit education and
Catholic charities.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he has decided to make an extraordinary gift to his alma
mata, Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   The Jesuit university announced Monday that McNeice had donated
$5 million to the school _ a gift that is being described as the
nation's largest single endowment for student spirituality and
volunteerism.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McNeice has done so much for Jesuit education and
Catholic causes,'' said BC President Rev. William P. Leahy.
``Boston College is indebted to him for this wonderful gift, which
will enable future generations of leaders to develop their
God-given talents and use them in the service of others.''
</P>
<P>
   The gift, which will provide support for BC's volunteer service
and student religious retreat programs, is given at a time when the
interest in spirituality and volunteerism is growing at secular and
religious colleges around the country. Thousands of students are
looking beyond books, sports, and traditional extracurriculars for
meaning.
</P>
<P>
   At BC, the popularity of volunteer projects and spiritual
retreats has outpaced the number of programs. Each year, 1,200
students give more than 80,000 hours in volunteer service programs
ranging from homeless shelters in Boston to poor villages in
Central America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   On the spiritual front, nearly 1,700 students take part in
retreat and spiritual formation activities sponsored by BC's
chaplain's office. The most popular of these are the Kairos
Retreats, student-led weekend gatherings, where younger students
meet in groups with upperclassmen to discuss the challenges of the
quest for spirituality in a busy college setting and an
increasingly secular world.
</P>
<P>
   McNeice, a 1954 graduate of BC and a member of the BC board of
trustees, said he was impressed by the breadth and quality of
volunteer programs and retreat offerings at BC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Jesuit tradition to form men and women for all
people,'' McNeice said. ``I was brought up with a Jesuit education
and this struck me as a way that I could make a contribution.''

BC ACADEMIC VP AND FACULTY DEAN RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES BANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A top Boston College official, David R. Burgess,
resigned Monday, citing a desire to pursue teaching and research.
</P>
<P>
   The college announced the unexpected resignation just a year
after Burgess assumed the post of academic vice president and dean
of faculties.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case where it was just decided by David and the BC
administration that this would be the best move for him,'' said
Jack Dunn, a college spokesman. ``I've spoken with David and he
seemed at peace with the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Burgess will be succeeded by John J. Neuhauser, the dean of BC's
Wallace E. Carroll School of Management.
</P>
<P>
   Before coming to BC, Burgess had served as a professor and
chairman in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University
of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Burgess declined to comment, but a college official said he had
expressed a desire to focus his attention on his chief love, cell
biology. He plans eventually to return to the classroom as a
professor at BC, according to college officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Burgess brought fresh perspectives to Boston College
during his tenure as academic vice president,'' said President
William P. Leahy in a prepared statement. ``I thank him for the
time and energy he devoted to enhancing all aspects of
undergraduate, graduate, and professional education on campus.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuhauser, who has been at BC since 1969, became dean of the
Carroll School of Management in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is highly respected by students, faculty, and his fellow
deans,'' said Leahy. ``I am confident that Jack's experience,
commitment, and knowledge of BC will enable him to provide strong
academic leadership for our University as we move into the next
millennium.''

BOOTLEG (Undated) - The Navajo Nation began its war on reservation
bootleggers last week with the approval of a number of new laws
that they hope will strip away their profits. Members of the Navajo
Nation Council, under pressure from a number of reservation
communities who say they wanted action and not rhetoric, agreed to
increase jail sentences and fines, allow the courts to confiscate
the bootleggers property and paved the way for families affected by
bootlegging sales to take him to tribal court for civil damages.
All of this is being done, said Herbert Clah, director of public
safety for the tribe, because bootlegging has become the business
of choice for more and more tribal members because of the massive
unemployment - up to 75 percent in some areas - on the reservation.
``And it's profitable,` he said. `There was one woman bootlegger
prosecuted recently federally because she was making $150,000 a
year in profits. She had five brand new homes and had bought new
cars for all of her children.`' By BILL DONOVAN. Story will move in

WILSON COLUMN (Undated) _ Someone apparently worn down by the

this summer. Though he would have shuddered at the letter's syntax,
he would have respected the impulse. White never lost touch with
the boy he had been. By STEVE WILSON. Column will move in the ``K''

WITH TIME RUNNING OUT, YELTSIN HAD TO ACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV AND BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ At first glance, Boris N. Yeltsin's latest government
shakeup makes as little sense as anything the erratic president has
done.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the scenes, Yeltsin's Kremlin entourage may have
viewed Monday's move as a matter of life or death. And that,
analysts said, is the key to understanding the mercurial Russian
leader, as time runs out on his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin Monday dismissed Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin, 47, a
former intelligence chief from St. Petersburg whose main political
trait is his loyalty to the Kremlin. Yeltsin replaced him with
Vladimir Putin, 46, a former intelligence chief from St. Petersburg
whose main political trait is his loyalty to the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin fell after the influential group of family members and
Kremlin insiders, known as ``The Family,'' apparently decided that
they needed someone tougher in the prime minister's office.
</P>
<P>
   The trigger for Stepashin's dismissal appears to have been the
alliance announced last week between Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a
likely favorite in next year's presidential elections, and a
grouping of powerful regional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   This union poses a threat to the Kremlin's influence in shaping
the 2000 presidential election, in which Yeltsin is barred from
running for a third term. ``The Family'' deeply distrusts Luzhkov,
and has been hoping to install a successor who would preserve its
privileged position, and, it is said, to ensure its immunity from
prosecution by the next regime.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov's new alliance with the governors, who were once
Yeltsin's allies, made it clear that power was slipping away from
the Kremlin. When word leaked that Stepashin might join Luzhkov's
alliance, the premier's fate was all but sealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only explanation'' for the firing ``is Stepashin's
inability or unwillingness to protect the Kremlin's interests in
dealing with Luzhkov,'' said Alexei Venediktov, news editor of Ekho
Moskvy radio.
</P>
<P>
   Even observers familiar with Yeltsin's penchant for
unpredictable moves expressed surprise that the Kremlin leader
would risk plunging the country into a new government crisis at a
time when Moscow faces a standoff with militants in southern
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is 100 percent lunacy,'' said the Communist leader,
Gennady Zyuganov, a longtime Yeltsin rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madness is hard to explain,'' added Boris Nemtsov, a leader of
a small pro-market bloc and a former member of Yeltsin's Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts agreed that this time, Yeltsin had his own interests,
rather than those of the country, in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin's team is concerned only with self-preservation and
self-interest,'' said Alan Rousso, director of the Carnegie Center
in Moscow. ``Unfortunately, they don't have a vision for the
country, and this is a clear sign that the country is adrift.''
</P>
<P>
   By naming Putin his preferred candidate in the presidential
elections, Yeltsin, who is barred from running for a third term,
has signaled the Kremlin's willingness to fight for the country's
most powerful office in next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   But will it fight fair? Putin, a former KGB spy, is seen as a
much tougher figure who is known for leaning on regional leaders.
As deputy head of Kremlin administration, and more recently as
director of the Federal Security Service, Putin was not shy about
opening criminal cases against uncooperative elites in Russia's
provinces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin's appointment can be seen as a message to the
governors,'' said Yuri Korgunyuk of the INDEM think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said the choice of Putin boosts the likelihood
that the Kremlin will try somehow to put off parlimentary
elections, set for Dec. 19. Putin, they said, is more suited to
carrying out a crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   They also said that about Stepashin three months ago. Like his
predecessor, Putin spent his first day Monday reassuring the press
that he had no plans to declare a state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Another theory on Stepashin's firing is that he had become too
popular. Yeltsin is notorious for jealously guarding the
prerogatives of his office. Stepashin's recent trip to the United
States received wide and favorable television coverage here.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin's growing popularity had made him a viable
presidential candidate. Yeltsin does not like that. He fired
Yevgeny Primakov in May and Viktor Chernomyrdin last year for being
too independent and popular.
</P>
<P>
   But that raises immediate doubts about Putin's potential as a
candidate for president. Will Yeltsin let his latest protege gain
popularity? Or should we ignore this successor talk?
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't take the president's words to heart,'' said
Nemtsov, once a favorite to succeed Yeltsin. ``He says a lot of
things in the heat of the moment.''

GOP STRAW POLL IN IOWA ERODES N.H. PRIMARY DOMINANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEAR LAKE, Iowa _ From the perspective of New Hampshire, Iowa
has sneaked in the back door of presidential politics. For years,
New Hampshire prided itself on being the first primary state. If
Iowa wanted to have the first caucus, well, what's a caucus,
anyway? Surely not as important as an honest-to-goodness primary.
</P>
<P>
   But New Hampshire never bargained on a caucus combined with an
August Republican straw poll, which many of the campaigns are
treating like the opening shot in the presidential race. When the
Iowa Republican Party holds its extravaganza in Ames on Saturday,
it expects to attract 15,000 voters, nine out of the 10 Republican
candidates, and 400 members of the national media. Only Senator
John McCain of Arizona, who opposes the ethanol subsidies that are
popular in the state, is skipping the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sort of like we have two caucuses now,'' boasted Steve
Grubbs, a former Iowa Republican Party chairman now advising Steve
Forbes, who hopes for a strong showing in the straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   The straw poll was always intended to be more about money than
politics. It costs $25 to ``vote,'' meaning that the state GOP will
bring in $375,000 if the expected 15,000 people show up. Most of
the tickets are bought by the campaigns and then given to voters,
who are bused to the event. The voters get free food, free concerts
by country music stars, and, if they are really desperate, hours of
speeches by the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire, meanwhile, has ditched plans to hold its own
straw poll, determining that such an event would be expensive,
complicated, and ethically dubious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to stick with the primary tradition of not having
to pay to see the candidates,'' said Jayne Marcucci, executive
director of the New Hampshire Republican Party, insisting that New
Hampshire is not jealous of Iowa's ever-increasing time in the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Elizabeth Dole entered the Republican race, she has
been pilloried for her reputation as an over-scripted candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard to imagine a presidential prospect who sticks to
his script more carefully than Texas Governor George W. Bush. From
speech to speech, from state to state, Bush recites the same words
he used to open his campaign two months ago in Iowa. He talks about
mobilizing the ``armies of compassion,'' and being a
``compassionate conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On this ground, I take my stand,'' Bush says at nearly every
event.
</P>
<P>
   Ad-libs are rare. When Bush spoke in the northern Iowa city of
Clear Lake last week, he made little effort to talk about the
city's beautiful setting and the lake behind him, shimmering in the
setting sun. Instead, he launched into his stump speech.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the speech is most interesting for what Bush does
not say. In his Clear Lake address, for instance, Bush never said
the word ``abortion'' and he never mentioned his father, the former
president. (Perhaps Bush has been reading a book on the 1988
campaign called ``Whose Broad Stripes and Bright Stars.'' The
chapter on his father's third-place finish in the caucus is
entitled ``Iowa: Bush's worst moment.'')
</P>

   The Texas governor, under strict orders to stay on message and
not flash his reputed temper, zealously watches his words. When
Bush was asked about an aide's optimistic prediction that he would
get 5,000 votes in the straw poll, the tight-lipped governor
muttered: ``I'm just happy we'll turn out as many as show up.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a Texas reporter pestered Bush with more than half a dozen
questions about why he refuses to deny using cocaine in his younger
days. Bush again stuck to his script, saying he wouldn't ``play
those games,'' nor respond to ``trashmouth politics.'' Then he
winked and smiled and went on shaking hands. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Forbes is spending his personal fortune in hopes of doing well
in the straw poll, splurging on a $10 million advertising campaign
that is mostly tailored for Iowa. But if Forbes surprises the field
in the poll, a major factor may be a few thousand dollars' worth of
high-tech equipment that he totes around the state. This includes a
small digital camera, a Toshiba laptop computer and two Hewlett
Packard laser printers.
</P>
<P>
   At every campaign stop, Forbes encourages Iowans to line up and
have their picture taken with him, and thousands have obliged. The
photo images are stored on a tiny digital disk, which aides rush to
insert into the computer on one of Forbes's two buses. Then, while
the crowd is enjoying the free food, Forbes's aides print out every
picture. At the end of the event, the guests are all invited to
pick up their photos.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy is paying off. Instead of dumping campaign
brochures into the trash cans after each speech _ as happens at
most rallies _ everyone walks away with a personal photo with the
candidate. As of last week, Forbes aides believed that the
candidate had posed with 5,000 people. If each of them goes to the
straw poll and votes for Forbes _ an unlikely scenario, to be sure
_ he probably would win.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, in an interview, said that this is all far different
from his last campaign in Iowa. He wasn't even a candidate during
the 1995 straw poll. ``The crucial difference this year is time,''
Forbes said. ``I've visited 77 counties in four weeks.'' (That's
out of a total of 99.)
</P>
<P>
   Bush, by contrast, has spent only three nights and six days in
the state _ hardly trying to keep his promise to take his campaign
to every front porch in Iowa. After Bush spoke in Clear Lake last
Wednesday, the sign-up sheet for buses to the straw poll looked
nearly empty. Bush did draw about 700 people to the event, and he
shook hands with everyone.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's supporters had to bring their own cameras, and take
their own pictures.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ As a defensive back on the University of Florida's
1996 championship football team, Ronnie Battle grew accustomed to
being in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing could have prepared him for the magnifying glass he
was put under July 29, when Associated Press photographer Ric Feld
took a picture of Battle fleeing gunman Mark O. Barton's murderous
rampage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared for my life,'' said Battle, 23, a native of Fort
Myers, Fla. ``I've never been frightened like that before.''
</P>
<P>
   Battle said that, as a football player, being in the paper was
never a big deal and, being an advertising major, he knows how the
media works.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this time, it felt a little uneasy,'' Battle said. ``I
knew that millions of people were watching and looking at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Feld's photo was picked up by many newspapers in the country and
also ran in Newsweek and Time magazines. It has become the defining
image of the massacre that left nine people dead in two Buckhead
office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, you are looking for the moment that exemplifies
what is going on,'' said Feld, who has been an AP photographer for
17 years. ``You pretty much know when you get it a good shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Feld said that, aside from American publications, the photo was
widely distributed in South America, Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Battle, who has friends all over the world, said he has gotten
calls from Canada, London and Japan. He said that, considering the
circumstances, friends have been very supportive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They definitely know that this was wearing on me,'' said
Battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know it was traumatic, so there were no jokes. Just calls
of comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   Battle said his office is right below the office at in Two
Securities Centre, where Barton killed four people before crossing
the street to kill five more at the Piedmont Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard the commotion going on upstairs,'' said Battle, 23, a
technical recruiter for the Bolton Group. ``We didn't know what was
going on. I thought it was the window washers.''
</P>
<P>
   Battle said it wasn't until someone turned on a radio that his
office fully comprehended what was going on. After the SWAT team
evacuated Battle's group from the building, they were sent across
the street to a parking garage, where they waited for about 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The SWAT team then rushed the group out of the garage and down
the street. That is where Battle had his date with immortality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We waited for 30 minutes after they thought we were safe,''
Battle said. ``Then they were worried that we were in danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Battle said he is still haunted by the events of that Thursday
two weeks ago. He said in the days right after the shooting, he
feared going into the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``You felt helpless, because you didn't know what was going
on,'' said Battle, who played for Florida from 1993 until 1998.
``In football, always have a game plan. You never go into something
blindly. With this, I didn't have any control. But I know that
because of God, I am here today. It definitely put my life in a new
perspective.''

EX-SPY HAS LITTLE EXPERIENCE AS POLITICIAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Vladimir Putin, the man Boris N. Yeltsin nominated
Monday as Russia's prime minister and his preferred successor as
president, is a former spy, a shrewd bureaucratic operator and a
completely inexperienced public politician.
</P>
<P>
   A reclusive figure who rarely speaks in public, Putin has a
reputation for near absolute loyalty to his superiors. Little is
known about his political or economic views.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, in a televised address Monday, Yeltsin said that
Putin was the man who would unite the country, consolidate reforms
and lead Russia into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will be able to unite those who will renew Russia's
greatness in the 21st century,'' said Yeltsin in a nationally
televised speech Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, Putin announced his candidacy for
presidential elections that are 11 months away, saying he had not
been planning to run but was accustomed to obeying orders and would
seek Russia's top office if that was Yeltsin's wish.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that Putin, a dour and colorless figure, would be
a tough sell for the Russian electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine that in one year's time it will be possible to
turn Putin into a viable public politician,'' said Yevgeny Volk of
the Heritage Foundation think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Putin was nominated prime minister Monday after Yeltsin fired
Sergey Stepashin, who served just under three months in the job.
Prior to his nomination, Putin was director of the Federal Security
Service, the main successor agency to the feared Soviet KGB, where
he served for 15 years as an agent.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career Putin has been a bureaucratic infighter
and a master of behind-the-scenes political intrigues.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Leningrad State University in 1975 with a
degree in law, Putin served in the KGB's foreign intelligence wing,
where he spent long tours of duty in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 he began working in St. Petersburg's local government as
an aide to Anatoly Sobchak, that city's mayor from 1991 until 1996.
He earned the nickname of Sobchak's ``gray cardinal,'' an ominous
phrase in Russian which refers to figures who wield influence
behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Sobchak's opponents accused Putin of employing the KGB-like
methods in his government work of intimidating the courts and
twisting the arms of legislators. Supposedly, he used tactics such
as compiling dossiers on Sobchak's opponents to force their
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the St. Petersburg government Putin operated according to
the specifics of his previous profession,'' said Alexander
Belyayev, who in the early 1990s served as speaker of St.
Petersburg's City Council.
</P>
<P>
   Following Yeltsin's re-election in 1996, Putin's career took
off. Yeltsin brought him to Moscow where he became the Kremlin's
corruption watchdog. In July 1998, he was promoted to director of
Russia's security services.
</P>
<P>
   Although Putin is widely viewed as a liberal, on his watch the
Federal Security Service prosecuted environmentalists Alexander
Nikitin and Grigory Pasko, naval officers who were accused of
espionage for exposing Russia's slipshod handling of nuclear waste.
It has also shamelessly protected the Kremlin's political
interests, often ignoring the rule of law in the process.

HURT BY DISCOUNT FARES, BRITISH AIRWAYS PROFITS FALL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Indonesia and Pa.)   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British Airways PLC said Monday that its first-quarter
pretax profit fell 84 percent as discount fares and fewer
first-class and business-class passengers hurt results.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes a day after the carrier said it would cut
back service on its least profitable routes and use smaller planes
on routes where it has been flying with empty seats in an effort to
increase its profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding gains, the company's pretax profit in its first
quarter fell to 23 million pounds, or $37 million, compared with
145 million pounds, or $233.4 million, in the period a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the decline in pretax profit, net income rose 43.5
percent, to 188 million pounds, or $302.5 million, compared with
131 million pounds, or $210.8 million, in the period a year
earlier. Net income included 177 million pounds, or $285 million,
from the sale of assets, among them British Air's stake in Galileo
International Inc., a global ticketing company. The results were in
line with analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Little improvement is expected in the near term. The company
warned that it would continue to face intense pricing pressure from
rivals in the next quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Other European airlines are also expected to post lower earnings
for the quarter in coming days because of weaker profit on North
Atlantic routes. KLM Royal Dutch airlines, the only other carrier
to report so far, said last week its operating profit fell 53
percent because excess capacity drove down prices and revenue.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways said it planned to cut capacity by up to 12
percent over the next three years as it weeds out unprofitable
routes to places like Jakarta, Indonesia, and Pittsburgh, Pa.. Most
of the routes to be cut are short-haul flights in Europe. The
airline will also adjust its routing plans, eliminating or limiting
service to more than one airport serving the same city like flights
to London at Gatwick and Heathrow airports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy of reducing capacity is ahead of target, and
through our fleet and network changes, British Airways will emerge
from current market conditions with lower costs and a younger
aircraft fleet focused on the profitable sections of the market,''
the chief executive of British Airways Robert Ayling, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the service cutbacks had been expected; British
Airways said last year that it planned to eliminate flights with
extra capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is everyday housekeeping,'' said Andrew Light, a European
airline analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in London. ``The big news
is that it has been accelerated.''
</P>
<P>
   British Airways said its yield, or average revenue per
passenger, fell 5.8 percent in the first quarter. By using smaller
planes with fewer seats, it hopes to increase its yield by 28
percent. The company wants to eliminate extra economy-class seats
while keeping or increasing first-class and business-class seating.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to take the backpacker from the south of
France to Los Angeles anymore,'' Light said, referring to customers
that usually fly at a discount and are not brand loyal.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the overhaul, British Airways said it planned to
invest 6 billion pounds, or $9.6 billion, on improving the
airline's services. It will refurbish its Concorde planes,
including a complete redesign of the planes' interior, and also
build a new lounge at Heathrow for Concorde fliers. &QL;

$1B EMC-DATA GENERAL DEAL UNITES STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Ruettgers is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EMC Corp. has agreed to buy Data General Corp. for stock worth
about $1.05 billion, expanding the reach of the computer storage
giant while ushering out one of the most storied companies of the
Massachusetts technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   Data Generalwas once a leading maker of minicomputers but failed
to capitalize on the rapid growth of the personal computer market.
</P>
<P>
   EMC, meanwhile, has capitalized on the booming demand for
computerized information-storage systems and last year sold nearly
$4 billion worth of products and services, compared to Data
General's total sales of $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   EMC said it will use Data General's line of storage products,
known as Clariion, to supplement systems selling for between
$50,000 to $100,000, which are aimed at small- to mid-sized
business customers.
</P>
<P>
   The deal values Data General's shares at 41 percent above their
closing price on Friday, but EMC chief executive Michael Ruettgers
said the premium is justified by the new products jis company will
now be able to offer its customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we looked at this market it became clear that we lacked a
product that matched what our customers wanted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some layoffs are likely to result from the purchase, EMC said,
perhaps from among Data General's work force. Data General, based
in Westborough, Mass., employs 5,000 workers, 1,800 of them based
in Westborough and Southborough.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruettgers noted that overall demand for computer storage
systems continues to grow, adding that ``I don't think you'll see
significant layoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruettgers also said that EMC, based in Hopkinton, Mass., expects
to hire 1,500 people soon, mainly in Massachusetts. EMC now employs
11,200 worldwide, including 4,600 in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of Data General represents the final chapter for one of
the best-known technology companies in Massachusetts. Its rise,
along with that of Wang Global and Digital Equipment Corp., did
much to build the reputation of Route 128 as a major technology
center. The effort of a group of Data General engineers to build a
super-minicomputer was the subject of a 1981 book by Tracy Kidder,
``The Soul of a New Machine,'' which won the Pulitzer Prize.
</P>
<P>
   But Data General had trouble translating its technical expertise
into growth. Its sales of $1.46 billion last year weren't much
greater than than its 1989 sales of $1.31 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Its stock trades at just a fraction of its high of 76, reached
on Sept. 30, 1983, and it lost hundreds of millions of dollars as
it updated its server and storage lines.
</P>
<P>
   Data General's sale comes just three months after the company
announced plans to spend $100 million to hire 450 new sales and
marketing employees, a big push it said would pump up Clariion
sales.
</P>
<P>
   However, at a press conference Monday, Data General chief
executive Ronald Skates said even that effort would not have
brought sufficient product to market to keep up competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Without the support of EMC's larger sales force, Skates said,
``we just weren't going to get there fast enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Skates said he will remain with EMC to help advise during the
transition but said he hasn't decided whether he will continue
after the acquisition is completed later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Boards of both companies approved the agreement over the
weekend. The purchase still requires approvals from regulators and
from Data General shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, EMC will issue 0.3262 shares
of its stock for each of Data General's 56.7 million total shares.
Under that ratio, each Data General share would be valued $18.59
based on EMC's closing price Monday. Shares in EMC fell 3 points to
close at 57 in New York Stock Exchange trading. Shares in Data
General rose 4 1/4 to close at 17 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   EMC will also assume about $212 million in Data General debt,
but said that will be offset by a greater amount of cash on Data
General's books. EMC will take an unspecified charge in the fourth
quarter related to the acquisition, which it said will begin to add
to earnings in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also gives EMC control over Data General's Aviion line
of server computers, which accounted for an estimated $560 million
of Data General sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts questioned whether storage-specialist EMC could
operate the server unit effectively, but EMC pledged to run it for
at least two years under the terms of the deal. Ruettgers said the
company didn't plan on reselling the unit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts who follow the company said they approved of the
terms of the deal, agreeing that it would allow EMC to offer
cheaper, mid-range products to customers lacking the resources to
buy its systems.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. managing director Steven Milunovich said the
deal would have the added benefit of keeping Data General out of
the hands of EMC competitors such as Hitachi or Hewlett-Packard Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a smart move strategically, and defensively,'' Milunovich
said.
</P>
<P>
   Loomis Sayles &AMP; Co. analyst Chris Ely also said the agreement
made sense. ``If they're light in one area it's low- to mid-range
systems,'' Ely said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of opportunity, particularly if they can take
the software they sell with large systems and adopt it for the
smaller ones'' made by Data General, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of a sale have swirled around Data General for years, but
Skates and Ruettgers said they didn't begin speaking in earnest
until late May, after Data General announced its sales force
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   In agreeing to sell the company he headed for ten years, Skates
said he felt ``a certain poignancy.''

COMMENTARY: THE Y2K SOCIAL DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this millennium year, many people will be looking for the
story of the century. I've already found mine. It's actually the
story of the  &UR; next &LR;  century, and it was carried on the wire
services the other day from Israel. It read as follows: An Israeli
man ``was pulled over Monday after a policewoman nabbed him driving
through the coastal town of Netanya with a mobile phone in each
hand. Engrossed in his conversations, he was operating the steering
wheel with his elbows, the daily Haaretz reported. The volunteer
policewoman flagged him down when she saw his gray Mitsubishi
meandering from side to side.''
</P>
<P>
   This Israeli motorist with a cell phone in both ears, driving
with his elbows, gets my vote as the poster boy for the social
disease of the next millennium _ overconnectedness. This is the
real Y2K virus for developed countries. It is the anxiety that is
going to be produced when telecommunications combines with the
``Evernet'' _ the technology that will soon allow people to get on
line from their watches, their cars, their toasters or their
Walkmans _ so that everyone will be able to be connected all the
time, everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   This virus of overconnectedness is spreading daily, and it has
no known cure. I was recently in a restaurant with my daughter and
found myself seated between two families, both of whose fathers
were speaking loudly into cell phones, as if they were in their
offices. I wanted to scream: ``Look, I'm on vacation. I'm trying to
get away from my office. I don't want to be in your office.  &UR; Turn
off that phone! &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   More and more I find myself reacting to people with cell phones
the same way I react to people smoking cigars at the dinner table
next to me _ violently. I call it Y2K rage.
</P>
<P>
   I can't wait for the day when they have soundproof,
glass-enclosed cell-phone sections in restaurants. ``Cell phone or
no cell phone?'' the maitre d' will ask. I also can't wait for the
day that Motorola comes out with a device that enables you to jam
all the cell phones around you as easily as opening your garage
door. Zap _ no more dial tone. So sorry.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that overconnectedness is the disease of
the Internet age. Because as the Internet and globalization shrink
both time and distance, it's great for business, but it's becoming
socially claustrophobic. Time and distance provide buffers and
breathing space in our lives, and when you eliminate both you
eliminate some very important cushions. The New Yorker carried a
cartoon a few weeks ago of a man escorting his date back to her
apartment door after dinner. She squeezes his hands and says, ``I'd
love to ask you in, Howard, but they start trading in Hong Kong in
ten minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend who works on Madison Avenue said to me that before cell
phones and beepers, when someone called his office and he was out,
his secretary would simply say, ``Alan is out.'' Now when someone
calls and the secretary says he's out, the next thing the caller
says is, ``Well, connect me to his cell phone or beep him.'' The
presumption now is that he's always reachable _ that he's never
out. Out is over. Now, you're always in. And when you're always in,
you're always on. And when you're always on, you're just like a
computer server. You can never stop and relax.
</P>
<P>
   When was the last time you heard someone say, ``Well, let me
sleep on that''? Good luck. A Wall Street exec I know tells me he
used to love going to Japan, working all day and then hitting the
great Tokyo restaurants at night. But now he works all day, and
just when he's about to go to bed in Tokyo, the faxes, beeper
messages and cell-phone calls start coming in from New York. ``I
haven't been out to dinner in Tokyo in five years,'' he says. ``I
end up working a 19-hour day now'' _ the full Tokyo day and the
full New York day.
</P>
<P>
   I visited my daughter's summer camp in the woods of Wisconsin a
few weeks ago, and one of the campers asked me for my e-mail
address. I gave it to him. A week later I was working on AOL and up
comes a message from this kid at camp. He had put me on his AOL
``buddy list,'' somehow got access to a computer in the backwoods
of Wisconsin, and when I went on line he popped up on my screen. I
felt invaded _ by a 12-year-old camper in Wisconsin, no less!
</P>
<P>
   What happens when we're always connected is that the boundary
between work and play disappears. Yes, working moms and dads can
now be home more. That's good. But what it often means is that the
workday just becomes 19 hours. I have a friend in a high-stress
government legal job. He told me he often came home early, and on
weekends, with his cell phone and tried to work at home to be with
his teen-age daughter. Even though it meant that 20 minutes out of
every two hours he was on his cell phone, he figured it was better
than nothing. His daughter disagreed. She eventually got so upset
with all the interruptions that she finally said to him, ``Dad,
just stay at the office.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm with her. There's no such thing as ``quality time'' with
your kids. There's only quantity time, and that's what
overconnectedness threatens to destroy _ if we let it. So please,
don't call me. I'll call you _ at the office.

 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ When Elizabeth Dole ventured into Iowa in
February, she was not greeted like another mere presidential
candidate but like a superstar. Television cameras trailed her
every move. In nearby Ames, she drew an unheard of outpouring: more
than 2,000 Iowans at one event, pressing to get close to the first
woman to wage a potent bid for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Dole had no organizational backbone to capitalize on
the enthusiasm. There were no campaign aides at the events to take
down the names of potential supporters _ a fundamental organizing
tool in this state. There were no envelopes for people to send in
donations. And there was no follow up; weeks passed before Mrs.
Dole delivered a detailed policy speech or hired a finance director
to solicit contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Now the klieg lights have shifted. Mrs. Dole is no longer widely
viewed by the Republican establishment as the obvious alternative
should the front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, collapse.
Instead of being a star, she has faded into the chorus with the
other rivals to Bush, struggling to fight her way back. Monday, on
a return visit to Ames, Mrs. Dole drew 70 people at one event and
150 at another _ respectable but hardly record crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to boil down to a race between Bush and me,''
Mrs. Dole said in an interview. ``Every single poll has me beating
Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Brushing asides queries about her campaign's languid start, she
added forcefully, ``I'm not going to be distracted by anything, the
kinds of questions you're asking, because that doesn't distract me.
I'm running my effort. And they can run theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   There are numerous measures of how Mrs. Dole has lost ground:
Polls in the pivotal states of Iowa and New Hampshire show that
Mrs. Dole, who once registered a distant but unmistakable second
place to Bush, has slipped. Her fund-raising has been sluggish. She
has not captured many weighty endorsements. And Mrs. Dole's
endeavor to persuade Republicans of her viability suffered a
further setback in May when her husband, Bob Dole, the party's
nominee in 1996, questioned in an interview whether Mrs. Dole would
even stay in the race.
</P>
<P>
   When Republican strategists are asked about the state of the
Dole campaign, they invariably respond with two words: missed
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a lot of excitement early on but she was a little slow
to capitalize on it so that when Bush got in he went from no
organization to a great one overnight,'' said Steve Duprey,
chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party. ``She had a real
opportunity from February to May before Bush got here. For some
reason it's taken her longer to get the organizational apparatus
cranked up. I think the level of interest, at least in New
Hampshire, initially overwhelmed them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is far too early to dismiss Mrs. Dole, until recently
the president of the Red Cross, and a former Secretary of
Transportation and Secretary of Labor and a Harvard Law School
graduate. While Mrs. Dole is not the sensation she was months ago,
she still draws crowds teeming with intrigued women and young
people (and even some Democrats) who flock to her appearances in
tiny Iowa towns like Coralville and Maquoketa. She has assembled
state organizations where aides now take down the names of
prospective supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole has begun to build a financial base by tapping into
support from women around the country. Forty-three percent of her
contributions have come from women; in all federal elections, women
account for roughly 25 percent. And her campaign recently signed up
22 women on her finance committee, each of whom agreed to raise
$10,000. (By the end of June she had raised $3.5 million, compared
with $36.3 million for Bush.)
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole, who is 63, has also become more comfortable on the
stump. She still likes to stick to a carefully choreographed
routine. But unlike in the early days of her campaign, Mrs. Dole
fields questions from voters and no longer dispatches aides to
shield her from the press.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a stunning move for a politician who has long found it
painful to talk to the press, she even picked up the telephone to
call a New York Times reporter unsolicited. ``Is it OK if I visit
with you like this from time to time?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As her campaign bus rolled through the corn and soy fields of
eastern Iowa the other day, with only one reporter in tow, Mrs.
Dole scoffed at the notion that she had let her candidacy languish.
She said Bush, whom she referred to as ``W,'' had been assembling
his campaign since 1996, and that every other Republican contender
except Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah got a head start because she did
not step down as president of the Red Cross until January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every other candidate except Hatch was at this some years ago,
including W. I was at the Red Cross,'' Mrs. Dole said. ``They are
totally nonpartisan, and I've only been out of the Red Cross six
months. We were starting so overnight that you don't just have
everything in place.''
</P>
<P>
   As the interview proceeded, Mrs. Dole departed from her usual
carefully parsed responses and dismissed any thought that she could
have geared up faster. ``Don't you think when this has been going
on just for six months that that's a rather unfair comment?'' she
said. ``Let's look at Bush. They've been at it for a long, long
time. You know that. Because there's no way they could have had $36
million if they hadn't been planning this for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounding increasingly defensive as she sought to draw a contrast
with Bush, Mrs. Dole asserted, ``The others have got to speak up
also. I think we have been specific. Would you agree to that?''
Wincing at a question about missed opportunities, she added, ``I'm
hearing the enthusiasm and the excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   She repeatedly cited polls showing that she could defeat _ or
wrestle to a dead heat _ Vice President Al Gore in a general
election.
</P>
<P>
   But the best gauge of whether Mrs. Dole can pull herself back
into her starting spot as the No. 2 contender will be at a straw
poll in Ames on Saturday. ``We are going to make history,'' she
tells crowds. ``This is important on the 14th.''
</P>
<P>
   The event is important because it will become clear whether Mrs.
Dole has developed the organizational strength and political appeal
to transform the excitement over her candidacy into commitment from
people (including many newcomers to politics) who are willing to
traipse to Ames to vote for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you can translate the interest into political support
is, I suppose, the fundamental question this campaign faces,'' said
Thomas A. Daffron, Mrs. Dole's campaign manager. ``We don't know
the answer to that yet. There isn't any history. There isn't any
barometer. There hasn't been a female candidate for president who
was serious.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While the idea of the first woman president excites many voters,
it also injects some risk and uncertainty in the party's headstrong
quest to retake the White House. The uncertainty placed immense
pressure on Mrs. Dole to demonstrate _ and do so early _ that hers
was a campaign that could win. She has also had to overcome the
fact that Mrs. Dole has never been elected to anything. So her
initial organizational difficulties made some Republicans even more
apprehensive. While most Republicans say the country is ready to
elect a female president, a full third say it is not, according to
an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll taken in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'm ready for a woman,'' Barbara Beck, a
retired store manager, said after hearing Mrs. Dole speaking
recently at a picnic near Laconia, N.H. ``I wonder if she'd be
strong enough. I just don't know if a woman could keep it together.
She's too cutsey. I want some desk slammer. I want someone to
holler a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole said she never encounters such remarks. ``I'm hearing
from women who will say to me, `I've driven my daughter half way
across this state to shake your hand!''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republican strategists argue that Mrs. Dole missed yet
another opportunity by keeping a low profile and refusing on
national interview programs to take advantage of her sex and her
star quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her calculation is that there's sufficient time to do it in
the fall,'' said Ari Fleischer, Mrs. Dole's communications
director. Asked if that was his calculation as well, he said, ''I'm
a press guy. You can never do too much. But I accept this.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by interviews with dozens of Republicans at Mrs. Dole's
events in Iowa and New Hampshire, she has an uphill battle to
convince even her admirers that she can take off.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's always impressed me as dynamic _ she'd make a great
leader,'' said Christine Gerling Cole, 44, an information
specialist from Davenport, Iowa, said after a Dole event. Asked if
Mrs. Dole will win the nomination, she said, ``My gut feeling is
that she has a good chance at the vice presidency. My gut is that
the country is not ready for a woman president. Maybe I'm wrong. I
hope I am.''
</P>
<P>
   John Stevens, 80, a lawyer from Muscatine, Iowa, put it this
way: ``She gives all the right answers _ she's got a thick record
of accomplishments.''
</P>
<P>
   But asked if she can win the nomination, he said flatly, ``No.
I'm afraid that Bush has got too much money already. That's the
problem. And if I think he's got the best shot, I would vote for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a standard speech she delivers almost word-for-word from
memory, Mrs. Dole recites her vast executive experience and laments
what she says is ``a deficit in our basic American values.'' She
has proposed a crusade against illegal drug use and describes
improving public schools as a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Dole has done little to distinguish herself from Bush's
friendly faced conservatism. She drew the most attention when she
broke from the pack and called for prohibiting concealed weapons
and supporting child proof trigger locks.
</P>
<P>
   ``She should have taken advantage of the early attention to lay
out some of her stands on taxes and welfare and crime,'' said Ed
Gillepsie, who ran the campaign of Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, who
withdrew from the race last month. ``I'm still not sure you could
identify one striking policy or substantive aspect of the Dole
campaign right now apart from the tack on guns.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A big part of Mrs. Dole's woes may be beyond her control: she is
simply swamped by Bush. On June 30, Mrs. Dole consented to a rare
national television interview on the NBC ``Today'' program to put
forth the message that there would be no turning back from her
quest for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Dole's appearance was only an asterisk because hours
later, Bush announced his $36 million war chest. From that day
forward, press calls to the Dole headquarters outside Washington
have declined dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press followed the money and gave much less consideration
to anything else,'' Fleischer said. ``It's not that Elizabeth Dole
went down; it's that George Bush went up.''

SMALL-TOWN OHIO MAYORS ARE SPLIT OVER LOSS OF JUDICIAL DUTIES

   ELMWOOD PLACE, Ohio _ By Superior Court fiat, judicial gavels
are being snatched from the hands of small-town mayors across this
state, striking down an old tradition and leaving Mayor Richard
Ellison ruefully asking what's wrong with local justice proving
more kindhearted than blind?
</P>

   Ellison, who earns $6,900 a year as a one-stop symbol of law and
order and management in this humble blue-collar village of 2,900,
further asks what's so biased about a mayor's cutting compassionate
slack when he sits in judgment of some of the very people who
elected him?
</P>
<P>
   ``I only maxed out one guy in my court in the last six years,''
said the mayor, a non-lawyer who described how he threw the book at
a nasty drunk who had destroyed the tree flourishing outside
Charley's Bar a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three days in jail and $600,'' said Ellison, sounding
judicious as he mourned the end of this state's ``strong mayor''
tradition of having local mayors, most of whom are not lawyers,
hear minor criminal cases ranging from disorderly conduct to
drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a traumatic thing, involving real-life circumstances,''
he declared, grateful to live so close to his neighbors when he has
to judge them. ``There's more opportunity for compassion. It gives
you a good feeling to go home and say, `I think I got the message
across and didn't have to wipe out some family's fortune.'''
</P>
<P>
   But a recent federal appellate decision found the system had
more potential for bias than for compassion. Since mayors control
town budgets and police forces, the judges said, it could be unfair
to have them judge cases with local police officers as witnesses
and fines that could boost municipal coffers.
</P>
<P>
   A good part of the 400 mayoral courts in the state will be
affected and face the option of hiring trained lawyers as part-time
magistrates, said Augustin F. O'Neil, the lawyer who successfully
challenged the age-old mayors court system before the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the 6th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The end of an era?'' said O'Neil, hardly dewy-eyed at the loss
of this vestige of Ohio's small-town life. ``It should be the end
of an era. Frontier justice is what we have here,'' he said, citing
the Magna Carta in his successful argument that for a
revenue-hungry mayor to serve constituents as both police
administrator and judge presented a conflict of authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to do with power and egos, just as any time politics is
involved,'' O'Neil declared in an interview. He said some of the
``strong mayors'' _ those who run a municipality without the
insulation of a separate city manager _ were as dictatorial as
big-city machine bosses. ``A lot of these burgs generate big
revenues from mayors courts. Under that robe, a mayor in effect
wears a badge.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellison, a 64-year-old retired truck-company manager who has
presided at thousands of cases, sadly dissents, fearing the ruling
is a step toward ``metropolitan'' government of centralized court
systems in which smaller jurisdictions like his will eventually be
eclipsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the criminal factor so much as that personal, that
family, that social and emotional value,'' said Ellison, who always
presided in jacket and tie, never a robe. ``A family I know might
stand before me heartbroken over some dirt-bag son or brother or
cousin. They talk directly to me, hoping for some mitigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor understands the basis of the court ruling for he
recalls his boyhood days of peddling newspapers in the now-departed
illegal gambling dens of this hamlet before the interstate highway
was built. ``A mayor could be a dictator in those days, but they
were benevolent dictators,'' said Ellison, honoring the memory of
such predecessors as Art ``Butch'' Wise, a butcher remembered for a
heart of gold and an iron hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then there was Otto Hessler, came over from Lichtenstein
as a young man and ran the village for 27 years,'' Ellison said.
``If you needed anything _ a ton of coal in a hard winter _ Otto
was the man who'd get it for you.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayors of Ohio are hardly unanimous in regretting the loss
of their gavels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mayors now are facing the possibility of liability _ that's
the crux of their problem,'' said John E. Gotherman, counsel of the
Ohio Municipal League, a nonprofit association of village and city
executives. ``Most mayors are concerned to protect their
municipalities and themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling grew out of a 1994 case in Macedonia in which a
citizen charged his civil rights had been violated when the mayor
responded spiritedly to an unpaid traffic ticket with an arrest
warrant plus a contempt-of-court charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly won't miss the hassle,'' said Mayor Elbert
Tannreuther of Monroe, who has sat in judgment of more than 10,000
cases in the last 13 years in his city of 7,000 residents. ``The
people you see in court today include a lot of repeaters, people
with just absolutely no respect for the system. I wasn't built that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Tannreuther said he found the court a catch basin for the city's
underlife more than a place of wayward charm. ``It was
depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellison agreed it could be depressing _ but also redeeming. ``I
worked closely with Bob Newman, a legitimate liberal, as
prosecutor,'' said the mayor, who describes himself as an
unreconstructed Goldwater man. ``We weren't out to hang anyone,
because that hundred-dollar fine might mean a bicycle for some
guy's kid. And the 15 grand we'll pay for a magistrate _ well, that
could go for a new roof for town hall.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil, the lawyer who challenged the mayors courts, said there
must be more to small-town life than nostalgia for the old ways.
``Justice needs to be blind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ellison, who has read bits of law in his years as a judge,
cited his own favorite prescription, a maxim from British law, he
said, on how to be a successful judge: ``First of all, be a
gentleman. If you know a little law, so much the better.''

STARR PLANS FINAL REPORT PRIOR TO 2000 ELECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel,
said Monday that he planned to conclude his long-running
investigation of President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton
before the November 2000 elections by filing a final report.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of such a report could complicate Mrs. Clinton's
likely campaign for a U.S. Senate seat from New York, but Starr
said his office's report would be a dispassionate recitation of the
facts and ``would not engage in characterization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to move forward very, very rapidly in that
respect, and we are doing so,'' Starr told reporters after
addressing a group of lawyers at the American Bar Association
convention in Atlanta. ``I would anticipate that the final report
will come at the earliest practicable moment.''
</P>
<P>
   But Starr refused to discuss whether he had closed out the
possibility of seeking an indictment against either of the
Clintons. ``On that, I'm not going to comment at all,'' he said.
``It would be inappropriate for me to be commenting at all about
the future of the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   He also refused to tell reporters when he would release the
final report that would effectively end his office's inquiry, which
turned five years old last week.
</P>
<P>
   The talk of Starr's final report comes just days after the White
House counsel who fought Clinton's impeachment, Charles F.C. Ruff,
left that job to return to private practice. Ruff's top deputy,
Cheryl Mills, was offered the job of counsel but declined it,
though she said she would stay on as acting counsel until a
replacement can begin the job.
</P>
<P>
   Associates of Starr have said that he has in recent months
decided not to seek an indictment of the president or Mrs. Clinton,
but that he had tentatively decided to issue a scathing final
report about their behavior. One associate of Starr said the report
would be ``blistering'' in its description of Mrs. Clinton's
actions, leaving open the possibility that its release could
inflict political damage to the first lady's Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr went out of his way Monday to dismiss the conclusion
that his office's final report would harshly criticize the
Clintons' actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would need to be a comprehensive final report _ that is
factually straightforward, that does not engage in
characterization,'' Starr explained. ``It's clear that the Congress
did not want a final report to be an avenue for alleging that one
or more individuals had engaged in criminal conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   After Webster Hubbell pleaded guilty to a felony charge on June
29, one day before the expiration of the independent counsel law,
Starr's office was left with one remaining chore: filing a final
report with the federal appeals court here that summarized its many
inquiries, from the Whitewater land deal to the president's affair
with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's associates had said that the report would convey a
critical view of Mrs. Clinton because it would raise unanswered
questions about the first lady's behavior in several land
transactions in Arkansas and her testimony under oath about her
actions as a lawyer in those deals.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Besides speaking with reporters about his office's plans, Starr
also granted an interview with NBC's ``Today'' show, a portion of
which was broadcast Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In that interview, he applauded a federal judge's decision in
April that stated the president had given false testimony in a
deposition in the sexual misconduct case brought by Paula Jones.
``I thought it was very strong language,'' Starr said of the
decision by Judge Susan Webber Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the White House said that the president will
pay the $90,000 fine ordered by Judge Wright. In the ruling, the
judge said she hoped that the fine might deter others ``who might
consider emulating the president's misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr refused to say that he or his prosecutors had taken a
measure of vindication from her decision. But he added, ``This is a
very distinguished judge who looked at the facts and came to these
conclusions. And I would just add that the system did, in fact,
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr also said that he was ``horrified'' when he learned that
the Congress would quickly release the Starr Report last September
to the public and immediately posted it on the Internet. He said he
regretted that the posting did not do more to warn the Congress
that the report contained ``sensitive material.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I really did think, and I don't mean to criticize
Congress, it made its decision, and it was a broad bipartisan
decision that we're simply going to turn this information over to
the American people,'' Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   And Starr said that he had watched the ``Today'' show interview
with Mrs. Clinton, just days after the Lewinsky inquiry had become
public, in which the first lady blamed her husband's problems on a
``vast right-wing conspiracy.'' The independent counsel said that
he ``simply took it as her sense of loyalty in light of the
president denying the facts.''

NEW YORK TIMES AND AMAZON.COM SETTLE DISPUTE OVER BEST-SELLER
LIST  
 (DW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Amazon.com and The New York Times Co. have settled
their legal dispute over the online bookseller's use of the
newspaper's weekly best-seller list to sell discounted books.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said in a statement Monday that they had reached
an agreement that would permit Amazon to continue publishing the
list of popular titles. The dispute had prompted the bookseller to
go to federal court in June seeking a ruling that would allow it to
continue to use the list.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement announced Monday formalizes many of the steps that
Amazon took in the early stage of the disagreement after the Times
Co. demanded that the bookseller stop publishing the best-seller
list in the absence of a licensing agreement. According to the
statement, Amazon agreed to list the best-selling books in
alphabetical order, post the lists after publication in the
newspaper and include disclaimers that The Times was not affiliated
with Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Amazon has agreed to continue providing weekly sales
data to the newspaper. It has been supplying such data, which the
paper uses to help compile the best-seller lists, for more than two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't threaten to withhold their data, but it was very
clear to us that their data is of benefit to us,'' said Nancy
Nielsen, a spokeswoman for the Times Co. ``So when we made the
settlement, it was written going forward that this was a quid pro
quo.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Curry, a spokesman for Amazon, said the company, based in
Seattle, would file documents to drop its lawsuit and that the
agreement had restored ``marital harmony after a brief spat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that this is an agreement that benefits the
book-reading public,'' Curry said. ``You have a widely recognized
list of best sellers on line so that people can readily know that
these books are available at Amazon.com. And from The Times'
perspective, the integrity of the best-seller list'' will be
maintained ``because it will include sales data from the biggest
seller of on-line books.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Amazon was already following the elements of the
agreement, Ms. Nielsen said that the written statement was a
promise to continue taking the same steps.
</P>
<P>
   The original legal action came during a price war over best
sellers on The New York Times lists, spreading from Amazon's Web
site to Barnesandnoble.com and Borders.com. The newspaper also
sought to stop the use of the best-seller lists on Borders.com but
did not send a warning letter to Barnesandnoble.com. The New York
Times has a business relationship with Barnesandnoble.com, which
includes a licensing agreement stipulating when that bookseller can
post the lists.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Borders, Rich Fahle, said the bookseller was
negotiating with the Times Co. to resolve the matter. Unlike
Amazon, Borders continues to publish the list in the traditional
numerical order of rankings.

 &HT;    `A force for good' and a bold voice: Clinton bestows Medal of
Freedom to Carter
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ President Clinton gave the Presidential Medal of
Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award, to former President
Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, in a ceremony at the Carter
Center on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton saluted Carter for making human rights a cornerstone of
his foreign policy and for brokering the Camp David peace agreement
between Egypt and Israel. He also cited Carter's support for the
Panama Canal treaty, which gives Panama control of the canal on
Dec. 31, and for re-establishing diplomatic relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   He said Carter has been a force for good since leaving the White
House in January 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a universally respected international statesman, he has
worked to advance peace, democracy and human rights and to diminish
hunger and disease around the globe,'' Clinton said in a citation
read at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton lauded Rosalynn Carter for working to improve care for
seniors and the mentally ill. He also cited her support for women's
equality and increased childhood immunizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together, through their many good works and their powerful
example, they have lifted the dignity of people everywhere,'' the
citation said. ``For this, they have earned a unique place in our
history and the respect and gratitude of all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton presented the medals at the Carter Center, a nonprofit
organization in Atlanta that the Carters founded in 1982 to resolve
conflicts, promote democracy and fight disease, hunger, poverty and
oppression around the world. The president has awarded medals of
freedom to 62 other people since he took office in 1993. He plans
to give freedom medals on Wednesday to former President Gerald R.
Ford and seven others.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Carter are the only Democrats to live in the White
House since Richard Nixon took office in 1969, but their
relationship has been strained at times. Analysts say Clinton
blamed Carter in part for his failed bid for re-election as
Arkansas governor in 1980. Several Cuban refugees sent to Arkansas
in by the federal government rioted, and Clinton asked President
Carter not to send any more refugees. Weeks later, though, the
federal government sent more Cuban refugees to Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Since Clinton became president, Carter has sometimes expressed
reservations about Clinton's foreign policy, but he has also served
as a diplomatic troubleshooter in Haiti and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   This past spring, Carter was publicly critical of the U.S.-led
NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. He called the campaign ``senseless''
and ``brutal'' in the way it inflicted suffering on civilians.

ALBRIGHT POSTPONES MIDEAST TRIP AT ISRAEL'S REQUEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced on
Monday that at Israel's request, she had postponed a trip to the
Middle East until at least the end of the month while the new
Israeli government tries to persuade the Palestinians to accept
changes in their latest land-for-security agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Albright had been scheduled to leave for the region this week.
But she said through a spokesman that she delayed the trip at the
request of Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who is trying to sort through
problems with the Palestinians over the timing of the pullout of
Israeli troops from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan now is to go towards the end of the month, the
beginning of next month,'' said James P. Rubin, the spokesman. ``It
is Secretary Albright's view and expectation that the Israelis and
Palestinians will work together seriously and constructively during
this period.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright is hoping to use the trip to push forward on two
tracks: toward carrying out the long-stalled Wye River agreement
between the Israelis and the Palestinians, which calls for an
Israeli withdrawal from another 13.1 percent of the West Bank, and
toward revived peace talks between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said that Albright would be visiting Israel, Gaza and
Syria on the trip, and he left open the possibility that she might
also visit Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   It will be Albright's first visit to the Middle East since
Barak, whose election was welcomed enthusiastically by the Clinton
administration, took office last month and vowed to seek early
peace settlements with the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said that before deciding to delay her trip, Albright
consulted with Barak; Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader; and
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa of Syria. Asked at a news
conference about Arafat's reaction to the delay, Rubin said that
the Palestinian leader ``expressed understanding with the timing.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak has asked Arafat to consider a revised approach to the Wye
River accords, which were reached last October near Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctant to concede territory before negotiations start on a
permanent peace, the new Israeli leader wants the third and last
part of the Israeli troop withdrawal promised under Wye to be
suspended and ultimately made part of a final peace agreement with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Under Barak's proposal, the two sides would move quickly to
negotiations for a final peace agreement to resolve the most
difficult issues between them, including the status of Jerusalem
and the future of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Barak asked Arafat to spend two weeks reflecting on the
proposal, and that period ends on Tuesday. The Palestinians have
publicly rejected the proposed delay in the troop withdrawals and
the attempt to link them to the so-called permanent status talks.
But Israeli officials say that the Palestinian response to them in
private has been more nuanced and flexible.
</P>
<P>
   One senior official said that except for a break of 24 hours,
negotiations with the Palestinians had been going on at many
levels. He described the talks as ``friendly, intensive and
progressing.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that although a two-week time frame had been set,
negotiations were likely to continue all week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Haim Ramon, a special minister in Barak's office, said that
compromise seemed possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our proposal were to be implemented, the Palestinians would
get 75 percent of what they expect by Nov. 15,'' he said in a
telephone interview. ``The debate is over the final 25 percent, so
the difference between us is not that dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite reports of progress, Palestinians officials continued on
Monday to publicly reject the idea of delays in carrying out the
Wye accord. ``They are not understanding the messages we are
sending,'' said Nabil Shaath, a Palestinian planning minister and a
close associate of Arafat.

VLADIMIR PUTIN: RUSSIA'S NEW PREMIER STEPS OUT OF SHADOWS AND INTO
SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Vladimir Putin is not a household name.
</P>
<P>
   This much the Kremlin was ready to acknowledge Monday after the
46-year-old chief of Russia's domestic intelligence service and
newly named prime minister was introduced to a stunned Russian
public as the man President Boris Yeltsin wants as his successor in
a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Putin does face a problem, '' said Dmitri Yakushkin,
Yeltsin's press secretary, at a briefing Monday afternoon, ``it is
that people know less about him than about other prominent
politicians due to the specifics of his work.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else is being said about Russia's newest presidential
aspirant, that much is uncontested. Most of his career has been
spent in the background, as befits a man who began as a foreign
intelligence agent for the old KGB, where he rose to the rank of
lieutenant colonel.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview Monday night, Putin _ a tall man with
icy blue eyes and a deadpan expression _ was more cautious than
informative, tying up his answers in tight knots. He managed one
half-smile during the half-hour conversation. He did make one joke
_ really a play on words _ when his interviewer asked what he would
do if people ``go out and sit on the rails,'' as protesting miners
did last summer on the Trans-Siberian Railroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go out, or sit?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go out,'' was the reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they will sit,'' he said, using the expression for going
to jail.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from law school in 1975, Putin by his own
admission served for many years as a KGB officer in Germany.
Returning to his native Leningrad _ Russia's second-largest city,
later renamed St. Petersburg _ he joined the international affairs
department at Leningrad State University. From there in 1990, he
joined the team of Mayor Anatoly Sobchak, a leader of Russia's
early democratic movement. According to one report Monday, Sobchak
was Putin's law professor at university.
</P>
<P>
   As a deputy mayor, and then first vice mayor, Putin was in
charge of international relations at Smolny, the building that had
served as Lenin's headquarters in the 1917 revolution, which now
houses the St. Petersburg mayor's office. He reportedly became
known as the city administration's ``gray cardinal,'' an
indispensable adviser regarded with respect and a touch of fear.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Torrence, an American consultant who arrived in St.
Petersburg in 1992 as an unpaid adviser to the Sobchak city hall,
said he worked closely with Putin, whom he describes as a ``most
intelligent and amazing man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin was a discovery for me,'' Torrence said in a telephone
interview, ``a quiet person, extremely hard-working, who was
subscribed totally to what Sobchak stood for. He was very loyal.''
</P>
<P>
   Torrence said Putin was instrumental in cutting through the
local bureaucracy so the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. could open a plant in
the city. Putin, who speaks fluent German, reportedly also helped
the Dresdner Bank of Germany become the first foreign bank to set
up offices in St. Petersburg, which at the time had ambitions of
becoming Russia's financial center.
</P>
<P>
   He also headed the St. Petersburg chapter of Our Home Is Russia,
a party begun in 1995 to support Yeltsin's allies in the
parliamentary elections. Afterward Putin was called to Moscow,
where he joined other members of Yeltsin's St. Petersburg team,
among them Anatoly Chubais, the former chief of Russia's
privatization program.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's jobs in Moscow included running the Kremlin's control
department, an internal auditing office, and handling the
administration's relations with Russia's 89 regions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 he was named head of the Federal Security Service, as
the domestic branch of the old KGB is called. He kept that job
after he was also named secretary of the advisory Security Council.
The second post, like so many others in the Kremlin, has proved a
merry-go-round for Yeltsin's sometime favorites, from the gruff
former Gen. Aleksandr Lebed to the omnipresent financier Boris
Berezovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on Putin's appointment Monday, Gennady Zyuganov, head
of Russia's Communist Party, dismissed him as a copy of his
predecessor, Sergei Stepashin, a former head of the Interior
Ministry, which like the Federal Security Service is a so-called
power ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the difference between them?'' asked Zyuganov in a
radio interview. ``Both are from Leningrad. Both come from the same
democratic team. Both unreservedly support Yeltsin and his course.
Both come from the `power ministries,' neither has experience of
economic management, neither of them has a party or a movement or
strong support. Both have to serve someone who has trouble
controlling himself.''
</P>
<P>
   But if loyalty is the main prerequisite for a long career inside
the presidential administration, then Putin has passed the test. In
his interview Monday night on NTV, Russia's largest privately owned
television station, he even made his own presidential ambitions
sound as though they had been ordered by a superior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be awkward if I said I wasn't ready if the president
said I was,'' he said.

YELTSIN OUSTS CABINET, APPOINTS NEW PRIME MINISTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Political unknown Vladimir Putin took power as Russia's
latest acting prime minister Monday and _ on Boris N. Yeltsin's
orders _ launched a campaign to inherit Russia's presidency from
his sudden benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, facing an armed rebellion in southern Russia and
provoking new political turmoil at home, gave no explanation for
naming his fourth government in 17 months and choosing as his
hoped-for successor an inexperienced politician not known to most
Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's nomination to replace Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin
took the United States and other Western governments by surprise
and shook Russia's already feeble financial markets. Even Kremlin
watchers familiar with Yeltsin's mercurial leadership style were
taken aback when he said he would like to see Putin as Russia's
next president.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, 46, said he had not not been planning to run for the post
_ elections are just 11 months away _ but added he was accustomed
to taking orders and would follow Yeltsin's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   The firing of Stepashin, after only 89 days in power, makes it
unlikely that Russia will enact the reforms needed to pull the
nation out of its economic crisis. Analysts said members of the
president's inner circle thought Putin would be tougher in dealing
with Yeltsin's political opponents in upcoming parliamentary and
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   The shakeup thrust Russia into another disruptive political
crisis, distracting attention from the Caucasus mountains, where
federal troops and Islamic rebels squared off in the rugged
Dagestan region where the militants have seized several villages.
As fighting raged for a third day, Stepashin warned that Moscow
risks losing the unruly southern province to the east of breakaway
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the situation in Dagestan is very difficult. I think we
could really lose Dagestan,'' Stepashin said at a final meeting
with his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   In making the announcement, the often-ill Yeltsin looked puffy
and spoke extremely slowly, with long pauses in between words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I have decided to name a man,'' Yeltsin said, ``who in my
opinion is capable of uniting society, based on the broadest
political forces, to ensure the continuation of reforms in Russia.
I trust him.''
</P>
<P>
   For Russians who once saw their president as the strapping
leader of this country's democratic transformation, the nationally
televised spectacle of Yeltsin annointing a bland career
intelligence officer as the man who will lead Russia ``into the
21st century'' underscored just how far the Kremlin chief, aging
and ailing, has drifted in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does he think this is, a dynasty?'' commented Mikhail
Berger, editor of the daily newspaper Segodnya. ``What kind of
democratic society has successors?''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Constitution bars Yeltsin from a third term, and the
Russian media has speculated that he and his advisers are
considering the possibility of postponing or canceling elections in
a bid to extend his tenure. Perhaps seeking to dispel such fears,
Yeltsin also Monday set December 19 as the date for elections to
the State Duma, the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Few believe Putin, a putative liberal for a career spy but a
politically inexperienced bureaucrat and an unknown to most
Russians, has any chance of being elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's complete madness,'' former First Deputy Prime Minister
Boris Nemtsov, once seen as Yeltsin's favored potential successor,
told Ekho Moskvy radio. ``It...is difficult to explain.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's approval ratings have been in single digits for the
entire year and leading presidential candidates _ such as Moscow
Mayor Yury Luzhkov _ express open hostility to the Kremlin in an
apparent effort to distance themselves from the unpopular regime.
</P>
<P>
   Most Russian politicians saw Yeltsin's latest shakeups as a sign
of desperation in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who will take a prime minister seriously if they change them
like gloves?,'' Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov asked in a
radio interview.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov also expressed concern that the Kremlin was planning a
state of emergency and the dissolution of parliament. Seeking to
avoid provoking the increasingly isolated, but still powerful
Kremlin, opposition leaders indicated that Putin stood a good
chance of being approved when the Duma votes on his candidacy next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently caught off guard, the Clinton administration reacted
cautiously to the latest political upheaval in Russia, saying it is
ready to work with President Boris Yeltsin's new choice for prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly it is within President Yeltsin's prerogative'' to make
such a chance, said David Leavy, a national security spokesman for
the White House. He expressed hope that a government led by Putin
would give new impetus to arms control talks.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise shakeup came after Stepashin returned from a visit
to Dagestan, where Russian forces launched an air and artillery
attack on the weekend against the gunmen, who are believed to be
members of a separatist Muslim movement. Fighting in the region is
the worst since the war between Russian troops and Muslim
separatists in neighboring Chechnya, the breakaway region that won
defacto independence in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Four Russian policemen were accidentally killed Sunday when
Russian helicopter gunships mistook them for rebels, the Dagestani
Interior Ministry press service said Monday. In addition, at least
15 Russian troops were wounded in fighting with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin met with Yeltsin Monday morning for what he thought
would be a briefing on the standoff in Dagestan. Instead, he got
his walking papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning I visited the president and he signed a decree on
my resignation. He thanked me _ and fired me,'' a visibly shaken
Stepashin told the Cabinet in a speech that was broadcast on
Russian television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expressed my position concerning the resignation to Boris
Nikolayevich, but this is his right,'' Stepashin said. ``I told the
president that I have been, am, and will remain with him until the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stepashin reportedly rejected Yeltsin's offer to head
Russia's Security Council, one of two posts vacated by Putin
Monday. Yeltsin named Nikolai Patrushev, the FSB's deputy director
and a lifetime security official, as acting head of the agency to
replace Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said there would be no sweeping changes in the Cabinet,
although technically all its members were fired and will have to be
reappointed. Russia just won a major debt restructuring deal with
foreign creditors and protracted government turmoil could hold up
new talks on debt rescheduling.
</P>
<P>
   The battered Russian economy also reacted to Yeltsin's shakeup.
Trading on the Russian stock exchange was suspended Monday after
the benchmark Russian Trading System index fell 11 percent in the
first hour. Trading later resumed and the index rallied to 101.72,
down 1.4 percent from Friday's close at 103.15.
</P>
<P>
   The ruble currency also began to fall immediately upon news of
Stepashin's dismissal, going from 24.9 to the US dollar to 25.9 in
street trading. Russia's Central Bank headed off a deeper plunge
with heavy intervention on Moscow's currency exchange.

MEEHAN WAR CHEST ALMOST $1.3 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gearing up for a race he once vowed not to run,
Representative Martin T. Meehan has amassed a campaign fund of
nearly $1.3 million for the 2000 election, one of the nation's
largest war chests for a House incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan, a Lowell Democrat who earlier this year dropped his 1991
pledge to serve no more than eight years in the House, raised
nearly $325,000 in the first half of 1999, vaulting him onto the
Top 10 list of incumbents with the most cash on hand.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the newest House member from Massachusetts _
Representative Michael E. Capuano of Somerville _ is struggling to
build a substantial reelection fund as he faces the prospect of a
well-financed challenge in the Democratic primary in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Capuano, who has yet to recover $50,000 in personal loans from a
bruising 1998 campaign, raised $131,654 in the first six months of
1999 and ended the period with $67,000 on hand, according to his
mid-year report to the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The figures are significant because party leaders urge House
members to vigorously raise money in the first six months of the
two-year election cycle to try to intimidate prospective
challengers.
</P>
<P>
   Capuano's cash total is particularly striking in contrast with
his predecessor, former Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II of
Brighton, who continues to control one of the largest House
campaign funds, nearly $1.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kennedy has not raised money this year, his decision
not to dissolve the House fund is a sign he is keeping open his
political options during his hiatus in the private sector as head
of his non-profit business, Citizens Energy.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan, too, is weighing his future options, including a
possible bid for the governorship in 2002. In abandoning his pledge
to leave the House by 2000, Meehan said earlier this year that he
had decided to seek a fifth term in part to continue leading the
effort to overhaul the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   The system has been bountiful for Meehan, largely because he has
been able to accumulate campaign money in the absence of a strong
Republican challenge since he first won the seat in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Meehan trails only eight House members, including
such fund-raising titans as the Democratic leader, Representative
Richard A. Gephardt, in the size of his campaign fund. The leader
is Representative Rick A. Lazio of New York, who has $3.1 million
on hand as he weighs a possible bid for the Republican nomination
for Senate in 2000. Lazio is expected to address the issue at a
news conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, GOP officials vowed to attack Meehan both for
changing his position on term limits and for his massive campaign
kitty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meehan has made a lot of hay out of the issue of campaign
finance reform, but he continues to lead the delegation in not just
the amount of money he raises but in the hoarding of it,'' said
state Representative Brian Cresta of Wakefield, chairman of the
Massachusetts Republican State Committee. ``It really points to his
credibilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan was vacationing and was not available to comment. His
chief of staff, Bill McCann, said Meehan will continue to abide by
the current campaign laws even as he tries to change them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's running for reelection,'' McCann said, ``and one of the
unfortunate realities of our system is that it can be very
expensive. That's why he's trying to pass real campaign finance
reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Capuano's staff said he had met his six-month goal of
eliminating debt other than his personal loans and is gearing up
for the reelection campaign. ``He has an aggressive fund-raising
schedule, beginning in September and beyond,'' said Capuano's press
secretary, Allison Mills.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of campaign cash on hand, Capuano was ranked 402d by
the Federal Election Commission among House members and a small
number of challengers who were obligated to file mid-year reports.
Representative John F. Tierney, a Salem Democrat, was ranked 396th
with a campaign fund of $71,919.
</P>
<P>
   Tierney won close races in 1996 and 1998 against former
Representative Peter G. Torkildsen, a Danvers Republican.
Torkildsen is not expected to run again in 2000.

CONTINENTAL EUROPE'S CORE ECONOMIES SHOW SIGNS OF RECOVERY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland)   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ After a half-year of economic inertia, continental
Europe's three core economies have begun to show clear signs of
recovery, the result not only of a gradual strengthening of
emerging market economies in Asia and Latin America, but of
tentative changes aimed at making European economies more nimble.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, France, and to a lesser degree, Italy, have been
reporting increased demand from abroad for goods and services for
the first time since late 1998. In France and Germany, consumer
spending is reinforcing the recovery. In Italy, the first fruits of
government fiscal austerity are evident, promising to help the
country catch up with its northern neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The continent's big core countries had in recent months all but
abdicated the role of economic engines to smaller economies on the
European fringes, like Spain, Portugal and Ireland. Lately,
however, growth has been so vigorous throughout the region that Wim
Duisenberg, the head of the European central bank, cautioned last
month that anti-inflationary bias was creeping into the monetary
considerations of the bank, which sets European monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   Defending the new single currency, the euro, for which
Duisenberg's bank is responsible, became an unexpected
consideration earlier this year, when the dismal performance of
these core European economies, by comparison with the United
States, caused the value of the euro to plummet by July to a low of
$1.0136, before it began a modest recovery, settling in New York
Monday at $1.0712..
</P>
<P>
   If there are risks to the new spurt of growth, they are perhaps
most evident in Italy, said J. Paul Horne, European equity market
economist at Salomon Smith Barney. But even there, larger than
expected government surpluses in July prompted many economists to
reduce their estimates of how big a percentage of economic output
the government deficit will be in 1999. In May, the Rome
goverment's upward revision of that estimate, from 2 percent to 2.4
percent, was a contributing factor in sending the euro into its
downward plunge.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in Germany, manufacturers reported rising orders in June
for a third consecutive month. In July, a strong increase in a
monthly survey of retailers amounted to a confirmation of growing
consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turnaround is definitely here,'' said Ralph Solveen,
senior economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by such signs, Commerzbank has confirmed its 1.6 percent
forecast for German economic growth this year, even as the
International Monetary Fund recently downgraded its estimate to 1.4
percent. The data prompted Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest, to
revise upward its estimate for next year to 3 percent, ahead of the
IMF's and its own previous estimate of 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, the recovery was domestic-driven,'' said Ulrich
Beckmann, senior economist at Deutsche Bank Research. ``Now
overseas growth is kicking in.''
</P>
<P>
   That overseas growth is expected to benefit Italy as well. Like
Germany, it relies strongly on such heavily export-driven
industries as machine building and automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, orders to Italian industry have been inching
up on a month-to-month basis _ 1.1 percent in July _ though they
continue to decline when compared with last year's figures. Yet the
growth surge in Germany, where Italy ships 55 percent of its
exports, makes an Italian revival seem to many all but a matter of
time.
</P>
<P>
   In recent Italian surveys, business confidence has been strong,
and consumption of durable goods, like cars, is rising. Italy's
leading economic daily, Il Sole 24-Ore, recently compared the
economy to a column of stalled cars. The lead vehicles were already
moving, it said, and it was but a matter of time before those in
the middle and at the end were set in motion, too.
</P>
<P>
   For all three countries, said Horne, growth prospects depend
more on the performance of close neighbors than of emerging market
economies.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 European countries embracing the euro _ led by Germany,
France and Italy _ conduct about 40 percent of their trade with
only two partners _ the United States and Britain. While the U. S.
economy remains strong, Britain, which has not yet adopted the
euro, is showing signs of recovery. In July, British retail sales
were their strongest in 18 months, while the service sector
expanded more robustly than at any time since early 1998. ``Britain
touched bottom in the first quarter,'' said Horne.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of providing a measure of permanence to the current
upswing, the governments in Italy and Germany have committed
themselves to cutbacks in state spending and changes in taxation.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany laid out a
radical agenda to slash state spending, freeze pensions, and cut
the government's share of the national economy over the next
several years, to about 40 percent from nearly half today.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, the change has already begun. Part of the greatly
improved government fiscal condition reported in July was due to an
overhaul of tax collection methods. In September, government and
labor union representatives will begin discussing radical reform of
the pension system, to bring down the share of wages represented by
payments for various social security programs.
</P>
<P>
   All three economies continue to be slowed by levels of
unemployment that are roughly double those of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in France, where consumer spending has rivaled export growth
in bearing the economy aloft, consumer confidence has been
stiffened not only by soaring financial markets but also by job
creation because of more flexible labor markets.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Barthalon, chief economist at Paribas in Paris, said that
legislative changes permitting temporary employment, notably of
young people, had contributed this year to a 2 percent increase in
private employment. Moreover, he said, while economists once
assumed that 3 percent growth was required before the French
economy began creating jobs, that level now appears to be only 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the strength of financial markets also buoyed French
consumer confidence. ``Wealthy people are obviously feeling
wealthier,'' he said. Moreover, he said, anecdotal evidence
suggested a trickle down effect to middle class families.
</P>
<P>
   Paribas, he said, had not raised its growth forecast for France,
which is 2.3 percent this year and 2.5 percent for 2000.
</P>

 &HT;    Speech controversy: Clinton addresses ABA members
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ President Clinton on Monday called on Congress to
break the gridlock on his judicial nominations, blaming the
Republican-controlled Senate with creating ``a mounting vacancy
crisis in our country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply cannot afford to allow political considerations to
keep our courts vacant and to keep justice waiting,'' Clinton told
the American Bar Association's annual meeting here. `` . . . We
know that justice delayed is justice denied.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments came just hours after a morning ABA panel
discussion on judicial independence during which speakers strongly
criticized the president's most recent judicial nominees. The
speakers claimed Clinton has capitulated to conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Influential GOP lawmakers have ``tragically discouraged the
White House from nominating someone who's shown sensitivity on
human rights,'' said George Kendall of the NAACP Legal Defense and
Education Fund.
</P>
<P>
   During a 25-minute speech, Clinton also called on the ABA's
400,000 members to press Congress to level ``inequities'' in
federal sentencing guidelines and to maintain funding of the Legal
Services Corporation, the federal funded agency that provides legal
aid for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments were warmly received by the ABA membership.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier in the day, the conservative Southeastern Legal
Foundations sharply condemned the ABA for allowing Clinton to give
the keynote speech.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation has filed an ethics complaint against Clinton in
Arkansas, where the president received his law license. Last week,
the federal judge who oversaw the Paula Jones sexual harassment
case against Clinton fined the president $90,000 for legal fees and
expenses as a result of a civil contempt citation against him for
giving false testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is with a profound sense of disappointment that the
national platform offered by the ABA convention will undoubtedly
appear to the American people as tacit approval for the actions of
an attorney recently held in civil contempt for misrepresentation
under oath,'' said L. Lynn Hogue, a foundation executive.
</P>
<P>
   But many attorneys in the audience said they had little problem
with Clinton speaking before the nation's largest legal
organization in the shadow of the contempt fine. After the speech
throngs of lawyers came forward to shake Clinton's hand or take his
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Kamau King, an Atlanta lawyer, said he thinks the fine was
absurd. ``What did he do?'' he said. ``He lied so his wife wouldn't
find out he had an affair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably any other attorney would have been disbarred for
perjury,'' Milwaukee attorney Oyvind Wistrom said after the speech.
``If he were disbarred, I'd feel very differently about him
speaking.''
</P>
<P>
   ABA President Philip Anderson, a Little Rock, Ark., lawyer who
offered Clinton a job after he suffered a gubernatorial defeat in
1980, said Clinton's address touched on exactly the issues
considered most important by the ABA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going into an election year,'' he said. ``We cannot
afford to have our judicial system crippled with vacancies.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the collection of judges he has nominated to the
federal bench ``the most diverse group in American history.''
Nearly half are women and minorities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Clinton noted, he nominated the first
African-American judges to sit on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Richmond, Va., and the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Also last week, Clinton nominated Fulton County Superior Court
Judge Gail Tusan to the U.S. District Court bench in Atlanta. If
confirmed, she would be the first black woman to preside on that
court.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Clinton said, the nomination process ground to a halt
in the Senate. During that election year, he said, not a single
circuit appeals court judge was confirmed by the Senate, the first
time in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   After U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist warned
that the growing number of vacancies could undermine the legal
system's ability to administer justice, the Senate moved to fill 65
vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, Clinton said, he has nominated 61 judicial
candidates, 16 of whom are due to fill ``emergency'' vacancies
because of caseload backlogs. The Senate has confirmed only 11 of
these.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not _ not, I repeat _ have another replay of 1996,''
he said. ``The worst effects of the slowdown are making themselves
felt across the country. Exploding civil and criminal court dockets
affect the lives of tens of thousands of Americans. They strain our
justice system to the breaking point.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to Clinton on Sunday, U.S. Sen. Orrin Hatch
(R-Utah), chairman of the judiciary committee, said action on
judicial nominations has proceeded ``in a balanced and thorough
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared to acknowledge that he is not pressing forward
with nominees that may be considered controversial or liberal by
GOP lawmakers. He said he has worked hard to avoid ``major
ideological fights of the kind we saw in previous years over
judicial nominees.''
</P>
<P>
   He could very well have been referring to Judge Rosemary
Barkett, the former chief justice of the Florida Supreme Court, who
was confirmed to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta
after a grueling confirmation battle.
</P>
<P>
   Since Barkett's confirmation _ and since Republicans gained
majority control of the Senate _ the White House has put forward
few controversial nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's last two 11th Circuit nominees serve as good examples.
One, Stanley Marcus, was nominated to the lower-court federal bench
by President Reagan. The most recent, Charles Wilson, is the top
federal prosecutor in Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Both were quickly approved by the Senate. Stephen Bright,
director of the Atlanta-based Southern Center for Human Rights,
sharply criticized Clinton's nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think in today's climate he would nominate someone of
the likes of Thurgood Marshall,'' said Bright, referring to the
late U.S. Supreme Court justice and civil rights attorney.

DEMAND FOR RISKY RIDES PRODUCING DEATHS, INJURY AT PARKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AGAWAM, Mass. _ As authorities investigate a weekend water-ride
accident at Riverside Amusement Park, a digital-age drive for the
fastest, tallest, longest, or roughest ride is feeding competition
for the ultimate attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it's pretty much an all-out war between the parks
to try to build the highest and most intense rides,'' said David
Escalante of American Coaster Enthusiasts, a Kansas-based
hobbyists' group. ``That's the number one thing that is attracting
their customers.''
</P>
<P>
   While strongly defending its safety record, Riverside Park's
operator said Monday it has closed 17 water-rafting rides in its
parks nationwide in response to Saturday's accident on a thrill
ride here. Eight people were hurt, one man critically.
</P>
<P>
   The US Consumer Product Safety Commission, in a report last
month, said injuries on amusement park rides are rising sharply,
sending 9,200 people to emergency rooms for treatment last year, up
from 7,400 in 1994 _ a 24 percent spike that outpaces increased
park attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'd be naive to say they're not competing for a group
of people who want to try out everything,'' said Lowell Gratigny, a
senior vice president at American Specialty Insurance Services, an
amusement park risk management firm based in Indiana. ``They want
the quickest or the highest. They're in the entertainment business
and that's what makes the folks come back.''
</P>
<P>
   The search for those thrills turned to instant terror around
9:30 Saturday night when the 2-month-old Blizzard River ride,
touted by the park as ``more than 1,400 feet of bends and
bottlenecks,'' plunged its patrons into the water in a capsized
raft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like we were lost forever,'' said Kimberly Pescaro, 27.
``As we bumped along the bottom every now and then we would hit
little air pockets and I would be able to stretch my head back and
grab a breath of air ... We were strapped in our seats, upside-down
in the water. All I could think of was that I would never see my
8-month-old son again.''
</P>
<P>
   Pescaro, of Shrewsbury, suffered a concussion on the ride in
which passengers float down the shallow, artificial river in large
round rafts propelled by the force of the churning water. Her
husband, Jerry, needed several stitches for a cut in his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Six other rafters were taken to Baystate Medical Center in
Springfield. John Pascone of Dayville, Conn., was in critical
condition Monday. His 9-year-old daughter, Angelica, and 4-year-old
son, Jonathan, were in fair condition. His wife, Kimberly was
treated and released on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Messier, 27, of Coventry, R.I., was in serious condition
Monday at Baystate. Her husband, Ernest, 32, was treated and
released. John and Jonathan Pascone and Susan Messier were admitted
for near-drowning. Angelica Pascone was admitted with a right
shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   Park operators called the accident ``unfortunate'' and promised
a rigorous review.
</P>
<P>
   While local building officials are responsible for checking the
safety of amusement park rides, inspectors from the state
Department of Public Safety are assisting local police and
engineers hired by the park to determine what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be very deliberate in our approach to this
examination therefore there is not a timetable for us to arrive at
the conclusion,'' said Brent Gooden, a spokesman for Premier Parks,
which owns and operates Riverside.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden said the 17 rides ordered shut down nationwide by the
company were made by various manufacturers. The company operates
parks from California to Georgia, New Jersey to Colorado, including
all of the Six Flags parks.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's accident was the second this year involving a
water raft ride at a Premier-operated park.
</P>
<P>
   In March, a woman was killed and 10 people were hurt when a
similar raft carrying 12 people capsized on the Roaring Rapids ride
at Premier's Six Flags Over Texas park. In that case, an
investigation found that five of the 12 inflatable ``bladders'' had
lost air pressure, causing them to ride low in the water _ one in a
series of ``extraordinary'' events that park officials said caused
the fatal mishap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six Flags delivers 1.5 billion safe rides a year and our
roller coasters will travel the equivalent of 70 orbits around the
Earth in a season and carry roughly 140 million riders,'' said
Gooden, who called amusement parks safer than water skiing or a
swim in the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   But William J. Buckley, the US editor of First Drop, a
London-based magazine that focuses on thrill rides and new
technologies, said the race for the big thrill is pushing some
parks too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really surprised to see this happen,'' said Buckley,
who is based in Maynard. ``There have been other instances of this
accident just this year. I think you're going to see sweeping
changes in the industry in regard to the design and fabrication of
this ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckley believes competition from other nearby water rides was
among the factors that contributed to Riverside Park's decision to
add the Blizzard River ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend in the industry is to make these wetter rides with
taller, wetter waves,'' Buckley said. ``A good river rapid ride is
judged on just how completely soaked you can get its guests.
Basically, it's not even healthy competition. It's rabid
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Malman, a Denver attorney representing a Colorado woman
who said she lost her memory on a roller coaster at Six Flags
Elitch Gardens park, said today's amusement parks are simply
misnomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're raising the stakes by making them more and more
dangerous,'' Malman said. ``Everyone's going after that dollar and
therefore they have to make them more thrilling. They argue that
there's a very small minority of people who get hurt so there's
nothing they can do about it. And, unfortunately, juries tend to
believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   John Graff, president of the International Association of
Amusement Parks and Attractions, an Alexandria, Va.-based trade
group, blamed the recent US Consumer Product Safety Commission
statistics showing a jump in accidents on a change in reporting
methods that his group is working to correct.
</P>
<P>
   Graff said it's natural that parks promote the superlatives of
their rides.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's certainly the way to market, sure,'' he said. ``You say
you've got the tallest roller coaster in the world or something.
But you usually only get to claim that for about a month before
somebody else puts in another loop or goes you one better.''
</P>
<P>
   And at Riverside Park Monday, the search for a thrilling ride
was still ringing the cash registers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love 'em. The more danger the better,'' said Bob Rouillier,
a charter bus driver from Pawtucket, R.I. ``It takes you to the
peak ... you know that thrill, that peak of the rush. I don't feel
like I'm going to be harmed. One accident out of how many rides?''

 &HT;    CAMPAIGN 2000: Alexander banking on Iowa's love of underdogs
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa _ In Washington, the pundits are speculating
about when he will drop out. In New York, Don Imus has been joking
on the radio about the sanity of his contributors.
</P>
<P>
   But in northeastern Iowa, it's a glorious day. The heat wave has
broken, and the endless fields of tall corn convey a hypnotic sense
of wholesomeness, as Republican presidential hopeful Lamar
Alexander's small entourage sails along through an ocean of green
toward its next small-town stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days are better than others. When the crowd's a little
better than expected or your opponent says something dumb. . . .
It's pretty good training for the job, actually,'' the former
Tennessee governor and U.S. education secretary muses, looking out
the window and reflecting on what he has learned about agriculture,
education and other subjects on his many visits to this key caucus
state.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander jokes with audiences that George W. Bush rides a jet
called ``Great Expectations,'' while he rides a Winnebago called
``Exceeding Expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, actually, the Winnebago is out for repairs and the
candidate is riding a Ford Econoline, loaned by a car dealer friend
of his national chairman, former four-term Iowa Gov. Terry
Branstad. Alexander's son, Will, and a staffer follow in the Ford
Explorer that was Will's reward for making all A's in his freshman
year at the University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Both Alexander and Branstad are decked out in khakis and red
Alexander-for-president polo shirts for the day, which begins with
breakfast with 20 Republicans at a restaurant in New Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   If he has any hope of getting back into a race in which he has
been swamped by the Bush gold rush, it depends on the strategy
forged by Branstad and several key Alexander staffers who cut their
political teeth in Branstad's campaigns. The Iowan pulled some big
upsets by outworking his opponents and focusing on rural counties,
and he hopes to do the same for Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iowans pull for the underdog. They pull for the small school
in the basketball tournament. They respect hard work and
humility,'' Branstad says.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander says he will be in the race through the caucuses early
next year, but the likelihood is he will need to pull off a
surprise and finish in the top three in this Saturday's GOP straw
poll in Ames, or his campaign will face death by closed checkbook.
Bush and Steve Forbes are outspending him nearly 10-to-1, employing
paid telephone banks to turn out Iowa Republicans for the event.
</P>
<P>
   So last week, Alexander and Branstad, with a few aides and
reporters, were pushing forward, against the wind of lowered
expectations, on a highway tour of 64 of Iowa's 99 counties before
the straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   In Vinton, where a dozen people have gathered for a sack lunch
hosted by a state senator, Alexander debates briefly on trade
issues with 81-year-old George Hoherz.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were pretty persuasive today. I've enjoyed listening to
you more than I thought I would,'' the retired broker says
afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You make progress in small steps,'' Alexander replies,
slightly encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   At each stop, to small groups of mostly gray-haired Iowans,
Alexander tells two stories that are the core of his message.
</P>
<P>
   One is about the dramatic events that led him to be sworn in as
governor three days early in 1979, to head off a pardons-for-pay
scheme by outgoing Tennessee Democrat Ray Blanton. The other is
about a Fort Dodge principal who was embarrassed at the jokes his
students made on a recent class trip to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   He promises he'll be a president who won't embarrass the voters,
who'll help parents teach their children right from wrong in a
coarser, more complicated culture than the one in which he grew up
in Maryville, Tenn., the son of a principal and a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Under other circumstances, Alexander might seem well positioned
for his second run at the Republican nomination. He has been
chairman of the National Governors' Conference and co-director of
Empower America, the conservative advocacy group. He has founded a
company that delivers on-sight day care and narrated a Discovery
Channel series on good schools.
</P>
<P>
   But whereas he had the field to himself as a moderate
alternative to Bob Dole four years ago, the middle ground this year
is crowded with Bush and Elizabeth Dole in the race. Most
critically, Bush has sopped up the money and media attention
Alexander got in his first outing.
</P>
<P>
   If they let ``big money'' decide this race before it even
begins, Alexander warns Iowans at each stop, the Iowa Caucuses
could soon become a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``This presidential election is not about raising money. It's
about raising children, raising farm prices and raising
standards,'' he says that night in Cedar Rapids at a backyard ice
cream social hosted by supporters Bill and Judy Chadima.
</P>
<P>
   The Alexander supporters who come to events like this tend to
identify with his middle-class, Main Street roots, and to distrust
Bush's wealth and family name.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that resonates is he started out like everybody
else,'' says Karen Malacek, one of the Republicans who has come to
the Chadimas to see him. ``I daresay in today's political field,
Abraham Lincoln would be one of the `others.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The following morning, Alexander speaks to a group of about a
hundred at an insurance company in Grinnell, an event put together
by his county chairman, Alan Clark. Leaning on the door of the
Econoline afterwards, Clark apologizes for the small showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a mob,'' Alexander replies. In fact, it's his biggest
crowd in two days. On the bus, he gets some pointed questions from
reporters about his prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you create a national organization, you can't let it go
away, because you can't put it back together again,'' he says. He's
talking about how he made the decision to run a second time, but at
least indirectly he seems to be speaking to the question of what
keeps him going.
</P>
<P>
   Some days are better than others. Speaking to the Pachyderm Club
in Marshalltown, Alexander seems for the first time to be visibly
down. Then a well-worn anecdote about Minnie Pearl gets a big laugh
and he's up again, plugging his proposal to replace MTBE, an
oil-based gasoline additive which the EPA says pollutes
groundwater, with ethanol, a move he claims could raise corn prices
35 to 50 cents a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   It's on to a brief stop at the Des Moines headquarters, where
his daughter Kathryn is checking on straw poll arrangements and
Alexander's brother-in-law, the Rev. Bill Karl, is manning a phone.
A Dallas minister, he drove up the night before to help.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander's wife, Honey, recovering from a torn rotator cuff
Alexander says she got lugging his bag through an airport, will be
joining him this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see that this is what you have to do to get where you
want to be,'' says son Will, who admits that campaigning this
summer has given him the political bug. ``You have to deal with the
small crowds and the lack of attention. You've got to go with what
you know works and just keep pushing through it.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it's on to the next small town, rolling through the
verdant countryside in the quest for votes, for as long as this
campaign lasts.

NEW REPORT CITES HIGH RISK OF DAY TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first detailed analysis of profits in the netherworld of
electronic day trading, a panel of state regulators said the risks
of the new and controversial form of investing are even more
ominous than they had suspected.
</P>
<P>
   Fully 70 percent of 30 randomly selected day traders lost money
and ultimately faced what the regulators called a nearly total
``risk of ruin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most traders will not only lose but almost certainly lose
everything they invest,'' according to the report, released Monday
at a meeting of the North American Securities Administrators
Association in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis comes just weeks after Mark O. Barton walked into
two Atlanta day-trading offices where he had accumulated
mountainous losses and opened fire on fellow day traders and office
workers. He killed nine people before fleeing in a black van and
turning a gun on himself. Authorities later found his murdered wife
and children in a suburban apartment along with a note alluding to
his big day-trading losses.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy threw a spotlight on the increasingly popular
practice of day trading, the most recent craze in the high-stakes
frontier of electronic finance. According to industry estimates,
4,000 to 7,000 members of a new breed of thrill-seeking amateur
traders are now pursuing their fortunes in some 287 boutiques
around the country that regulators have likened to gambling
parlors.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by promises of easy money, dedicated day traders work
eight hours a day, five days a week, staring at banks of computer
screens that provide direct electronic links to the markets. Often,
they perform hundreds of transactions a day, paying commissions for
each trade. They buy blocks of shares, holding them sometimes for
only seconds, hoping the price will briefly rise so they can dump
the shares for a profit. Instead of relying on stock-market
knowledge, they live by lightning reactions to minuscule price
movements.
</P>
<P>
   While the industry has said most day-traders make money if they
stick with it long enough, touting the success stories of those who
parlayed small accounts into multimillion-dollar fortunes,
regulators have struggled to sound a note of caution. But until now
there's been little hard data to rely on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, we've been able to substantiate what common sense
told us anyway,'' said Phil Feigin, executive director of NASAA.
``You just can't win often enough to make it worth your while. It's
essentially hopeless.''
</P>
<P>
   The study examined 30 randomly selected accounts at the
Watertown, Mass. branch of All-Tech Investment Group, which
Massachusetts securities regulators shut down late last year,
charging abuses that ranged from forgery to deceptive marketing.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of the most profitable accounts found that even
those ``did not produce a return commensurate with the risk to
which they were exposed,'' the report said. And while 30 percent of
the accounts examined were profitable, those traders appeared to
rely more on luck than market savvy, making money from one big
winning trade and losing on the vast majority of their stock
transactions, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the analysis showed the day traders were required to
pay such high commissions on their trades that it would be
difficult to be profitable on a consistent basis.
</P>
<P>
   Firms need an endless supply of day-trading clients and the
commissions they generate to cover high capital and operating costs
that run upwards of $30,000 per customer, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely clear that the average public investor should
refrain from short-term trading,'' the report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Day-trading advocates immediately lashed out at the study,
saying most day-trading firms make clear to prospective clients the
risks of day trading and carefully screen applicants, taking only
those with enough money to absorb losses.
</P>
<P>
   They also criticized the study for focusing on accounts at a
single firm. ``Simply put, the study . . . is not a representative
sample of the industry,'' said Saul Cohen, an attorney for the
Electronic Traders Association.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the association wants to work with regulators in
enforcing existing regulations. ``All day-trading firms can and
must strive to improve their disclosure mechanisms and their
ethical practices,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said securities regulators should step up inspections
of day-trading firms and enforce limits on traders' ability to
trade with borrowed money.

LUKAS GETS HIS TURN AND ENTERS THE HALL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky., Wis., N.J.)   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ D. Wayne Lukas, the most successful and
at times the most second-guessed trainer in racing, was inducted
into the sport's Hall of Fame Monday. In an upbeat and otherwise
healing speech that drew standing ovations, ``I make no apologies
for what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been criticized by certain people in the industry who
don't always agree with what we do,'' he said. ``But it's my nature
to push the envelope every time. If you want a coach who wants to
walk the ball up the court, you better get another guy because
we're going to run and press all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, who was elected by a landslide in his first year on the
ballot, was inducted with a show-stopping speech that ranged from
gratitude to humility to unyielding affirmation for his strict
style. He recalled that when his filly Winning Colors won the
Kentucky Derby in 1988, he said: ``My turn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Aug. 9, 1999, it's my turn,'' he said. ``What does it
all mean? It means that whenever champions gather, when all
champions from different sports gather, I'm just going to stand up
and say, `I belong.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas won his turn before a full house in the sales pavilion two
blocks from the Saratoga Race Course, which is marking its 131st
year of racing in the Adirondacks. The audience was enriched with
an array of Hall of Fame jockeys and trainers, including Angel
Cordero Jr., Ron Turcotte, Jerry Bailey, John Nerud and Allen
Jerkens.
</P>
<P>
   He was inducted along with the jockey Russell Baze _ who has won
more than 6,000 races and who rode 400 winners for seven straight
years, mostly in northern California _ and with three champion
horses from the past: Gun Bow, who raced in the 1960s and twice
outran the great Kelso; Exceller, who beat Seattle Slew and
Affirmed in the Jockey Club Gold Cup in 1978, and Miesque, the
European filly who won the Breeders' Cup Mile in 1987 and 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, who is 63, was surrounded on the stage by tangible
evidence of his success: six men who became trainers after starting
their careers as his assistant. Todd Pletcher, Mark Hennig, Kiaran
McLaughlin, Dallas Stewart, Randy Bradshaw and Jeff Lukas, his son,
served as presenters when Lukas received his Hall of Fame plaque,
and they flanked him when he accepted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``These young men were going to be outstanding horsemen even if
they hadn't worked for Wayne Lukas,'' he said. ``There was a
trade-off here, and I got the best of it. Those records and numbers
on this plaque would never have happened if it weren't for these
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The records and numbers include $200 million won in purses, 14
years as the country's leading money winner, 19 champions, 13
winners in the Breeders' Cup, 4 victories in the Kentucky Derby, 12
victories in all Triple Crown races, 6 straight Triple Crown races
won and a career record of 3,750 winners and more than 500 stakes
winners, including Criminal Type, Lady's Secret, Capote, Flanders,
Serena's Song, Gulch, Terlingua, Timber Country and this year's
Derby and Preakness winner, Charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas has been a master at taking smart juveniles and turning
them into classic winners and champions, but he has been criticized
for rigorous training methods on horses who later broke down. Yet
he kept winning at a revolutionary rate.
</P>
<P>
   He was denied entry into the Hall of Fame in recent years
because he may not have been a licensed trainer of thoroughbreds
for the required 25 years. But Lukas, who started as a trainer of
quarter horses, insisted that he had trained thoroughbreds far
longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reflect on 45 years with horses,'' he said, ``and ask: Why
me? Why am I so lucky? A boy growing up in a community of 8,000 in
the heart of Wisconsin where the snow gets as high as this
microphone, and making it to Saratoga.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FINISH LINES
</P>
<P>
   With the Hall of Fame jockey Jerry Bailey riding, Marquette, the
6-5 favorite, won the National Museum of Racing Hall of Fame
Handicap on Monday by 1\ lengths over Phi Beta Doc. He ran the mile
and one-eighth on the turf in 1:49 1/5. ... Menifee, winner of the
$1 million Haskell at Monmouth Park. N.J., on Sunday, returned to
Saratoga with Elliott Walden, his trainer, who will aim for the
Travers on Aug. 28. Ecton Park, another Walden colt and winner of
the Jim Dandy, was showing no sign of fatigue but was not likely to
run in the Travers. Cat Thief, second in the Haskell, was expected
back at Saratoga on Tuesday. Forestry, third in the Haskell,
arrived at Saratoga in good shape, but his trainer, Bob Baffert,
said, ``I want to see how he is training over the track before
making any decision on the Travers.'' &QL;

ADVERTISING: SIREN CALLS SOUGHT FOR CONDE NAST'S WEB OF SITES 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A leading Web publisher is embarking on an elaborate
advertising and marketing effort both on and off line, hoping,
among other things, to add more fizz to Phys.com, encourage
curiosity about Epicurious.com and stimulate computer users to
check in with Concierge.com.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher is Conde Net, the interactive division of Advance
Publications. Through another division, Conde Nast Publications,
Advance owns familiar magazines like Architectural Digest, Bon
Appetit, Conde Nast Traveler, Details, GQ, Glamour, Gourmet,
Mademoiselle, The New Yorker, Self and Vanity Fair. The Conde Net
Web sites are inspired by their print siblings but offer different
content to help dispel perceptions that they are merely on-line
versions of dead-tree media.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, with a budget estimated at more than $20 million,
is indicative of myriad Web publishers' attempts to attract
attention in a media category that has grown cluttered in, well,
Internet time. After all, before a Web site's content can become
sticky _ that is, appealing enough to generate relatively long
visits _ someone has to reach out and touch the site in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plethora of dot-coms makes it hard to establish a brand,''
said Sarah Chubb, director for Conde Net in New York. ``We know who
it is we want, but it's harder to get them because of all that's
out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to communicate the richness of the content to
those who have not seen it before, and even to those who have not
been on line before.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the primary reason for the presence of the off-line
media on the schedule along with ads on Web sites. There will be
television and radio commercials, newspaper and magazine
advertisements, ads on postcards and possibly other pitches like
posters in stores and outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   The Conde Net sites to be promoted by the campaign are Phys.com,
for health and fitness topics aimed at women; Epicurious.com, for
food and cooking topics; Concierge.com, a site for travel planning
that had been known as Epicurious Travel and is scheduled to be
reintroduced a week from Tuesday, and Swoon.com, for what Conde Net
describes as ``dating, mating and relating'' topics for men and
women.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for one or two more sites to be introduced by the end
of the year, Ms. Chubb said, adding that one of them would probably
be devoted to fashion, a Conde Nast mainstay in Vogue and other
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The creative chores for Phys.com and Concierge.com are being
handled by Robaire &AMP; Hogshead in Venice, Calif. Ads for the
travel-related site present it as the best choice ``whatever your
plans,'' whether they involve a trip to visit castles in
Transylvania or to attend the annual garlic festival in Gilroy,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign for Phys.com carries the theme ``Fitness from the
outside in.'' The television spots and print ads are centered on
silhouettes of nude women that while tasteful might not be
sufficiently so for reproduction in a family newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The Phys.com campaign takes a low-key, wry tone. Here are some
lines: ``If you don't shape your body, Twinkies will,'' ``You know
how you feel in your favorite dress? Feel that way naked'' and
``Pretty is something you're born with. But beautiful, that's an
equal-opportunity adjective.''
</P>
<P>
   Media duties for Phys.com, Concierge.com and Swoon.com are being
handled by CIA VSM Media in New York, part of CIA Medianetwork. The
Swoon.com creative duties are handled in-house.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the creative and media assignments for Epicurious.com,
the first and largest of the sites, have been awarded to
Margeotes/Fertitta &AMP; Partners, part of the MDC Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in concept development,'' said George A. Fertitta,
president at Margeotes/Fertitta, a New York agency that has handled
campaigns for other Web sites like About.com and for MediaOne
Express, a high-speed Internet access service. Though
Margeotes/Fertitta has worked before for Conde Nast, this is its
initial assignment from Conde Net.
</P>
<P>
   The core of Epicurious.com is a recipe database, Ms. Chubb said,
adding that E-commerce is to be added in October under an agreement
with Williams-Sonoma Inc. in San Francisco, the retailer of
cookware and related products.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers on the Conde Net sites include Eastman Kodak Co.,
Ford Motor Co., Gap Inc., General Motors Corp., the Kraft Foods
unit of Philip Morris Cos., Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., Seagram Co. and
Visa.
</P>
<P>
   The sites are also turning out to generate revenue for Advance
Publications in another way, by selling subscriptions to Conde Nast
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chubb offered a fascinating footnote: Of the 70 percent of
on-line subscribers in January who paid with credit cards, the
names of 80 percent of them were not already on file in the
voluminous Conde Nast consumer database, one of the most
comprehensive in consumer marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about your Net gains.

<P>
   ROCKDALE COUNTY, Ga. _ Offering the first detailed look at the
case against Anthony ``T.J.'' Solomon, Rockdale County prosecutors
said Monday the 15-year-old coldly planned his attack before he
entered the Heritage High School commons area and sprayed it with
bullets May 20.
</P>
<P>
   Their evidence:
</P>
<P>
   _ A handwritten note outlining plans for the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   _ A printout of bomb-making instructions titled ``Bombs and
Deadly Ideas by 'T.J.' Solomon.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Testimony by fellow students that Solomon had vowed to do a
better job than Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, the suicidal
attackers at Colorado's Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he would even shoot me,'' testified Teeunia Stroud,
who said she was a friend of Solomon's.
</P>
<P>
   Hugging a .22-caliber sawed-off rifle at his hip, prosecutors
said, Solomon peppered the ammunition randomly into the crowd of
150 to 200 students, hitting six of them. He ran out the school
door, then pulled out a .357 handgun when he realized two of his
classmates were chasing him.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Brandon Mitchell, said Solomon fired a shot at him,
forcing Mitchell to jump into the bushes. Two other shots followed,
one into a classroom, the other's direction unknown.
</P>
<P>
   At the Juvenile Court hearing to determine whether Solomon
should be tried as a juvenile or as an adult, prosecutors revealed
the contents of a note found in Solomon's home after the attack.
The note says the motive for the attack ``will have to remain a
mystery'' and cautioned authorities to look for bombs at Heritage.
None were found.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing will resume today.

   Below is the text of the letter found under Anthony B. ``T.J.''
Solomon's bed, as read aloud in court Monday:
</P>
<P>
   No one could ever know how I feel. No one will ever know. Even
the smallest of scars can run the deepest. I've overcome a lot in
my few years. But I understand I'm still leaving a lot behind me
that I haven't even experienced yet. There aren't any words that I
can say to describe how I feel. The one big question everybody's
probably wondering about is why? Well for the sake of my brothers
and sisters related to the trenchcoat mafia, that will have to
remain a mystery to the public eye. I have been planning this for
years, but I finally got pissed off enough to really do it. This
mission has nothing to do with Hitler. It's not because I was
picked on. It goes further than that. I'm still not sure that
bombing the school is such a good idea. So I at least give you an
idea of what's going on. If the cops have been doing their jobs
correctly, you'll have found the sheets I printed out with the bomb
procedures on them. Four of those bombs, including three that are
not there, have been placed somewhere in or around Heritage High
School. All in all, there are maybe only 17, if that. Be very
careful. The drop of a safety pin could set at least six off (I've
tried that).

WRANGLING OVER BUDGET SURPLUS EXPOSES RIFTS BETWEEN PARTIES 
</HEADLINE>

603-1036.) 
(yn) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The heated battle over how to use projected federal
budget surpluses has exposed deep rifts between the two parties,
both in political and economic terms.
</P>
<P>
   It has divided Democrats and Republicans over such basic issues
as whether there really is a federal budget surplus. It has forced
the two parties to articulate their cases for and against tax cuts
and government spending as ways of improving the country's
long-term prospects. It has set the stage for a potential debate
over an issue of real substance in next year's critical election
for control of the White House and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it has raised the prospect of actually reducing the
national debt, a problem that Washington has not had the luxury of
addressing for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Round one in the battle ended last week, when Republicans pushed
their $792 billion tax cut plan through Congress in the face of
President Clinton's veto threat. Round two will start after Labor
Day, when official Washington returns from its summer vacation and
the two parties decide whether to seek compromise or to leave the
issue for the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   The starting point for any discussion is getting a handle on how
much money is up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office projects that the total federal
budget surplus over the next 10 years will be $2.9 trillion. Of
that, $1.9 trillion is generated by payroll tax revenues that are
earmarked for Social Security. The two parties have more or less
agreed to take that $1.9 trillion off the table, allowing it to be
used only to reduce the national debt or to help finance an
overhaul of the retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the fight is over the remaining portion of nearly $1
trillion, which represents the surplus generated by general tax
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say the figure is so big that the country can afford
a $792 billion tax cut and still find plenty of money for needs
like adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare and increasing
spending on the military.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats point out that the surplus projections are based
on a series of questionable premises: that the economy will avoid a
protracted downturn; that unexplained surges in revenue will
continue, and that the forecasting ability of budget analysts will
prove far more accurate than it has in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the projections assume what many say is an
unrealistically low level of increases in government spending. The
Congressional Budget Office surplus estimate is based on Congress
remaining within strict spending limits requiring cuts through
2002, and then increasing spending at no more than the rate of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet based on the appropriations bills moving through the House
and Senate under the control of the Republican majority, Congress
is on a path to shatter the spending caps next year, and indeed to
use up all of next year's projected non-Social Security surplus of
$14 billion.
</P>
<P>
   If that pattern of rising spending were to continue, the
non-Social Security portion of the surplus would all but disappear
before it became available for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   These surplus numbers give pie in the sky a good name,'' said
Thomas S. Kahn, the Democratic staff director of the House Budget
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn helped produce a recent report for House Democrats that
looked at what would happen if spending were to increase in line
with historical trends and political realities. If spending were to
increase just enough to keep up with inflation from now through
2009, the report concluded, it would use $595 billion of the $996
billion surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats then looked at emergency spending, money that
Congress appropriates each year to deal with unanticipated needs
ranging from hurricanes to aid for farmers. From 1991 through 1998,
emergency spending averaged $9 billion a year, not including the
costs of the Gulf war. The committee then assumed that emergency
spending would remain at that average level for the next decade,
and subtracted an additional $90 billion from the surplus, leaving
just $311 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more. The surplus estimate also assumed that all of
the excess revenues would go to reducing the national debt,
bringing down the government's interest costs. To the degree that
the surplus goes to spending _ or tax cuts _ those interest savings
would not be realized. The committee calculated that the increased
interest costs from maintaining inflation-adjusted levels of
spending and accounting for emergency spending would be $179
billion.
</P>
<P>
   After accounting for an additional $30 billion needed to pay for
Social Security's operations over the next decade, the Democratic
analysis concluded that the surplus over the next 10 years under
its assumptions would be only $100 billion.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, that Democratic argument has not swayed
Republicans. And even the White House is still assuming that it has
nearly $1 trillion to divide up, allocating a third of the
non-Social Security surplus to additional spending.
</P>
<P>
   So for the most part the debate has not been over the
availability of the surplus but over the relative merits of tax
cuts, increasing spending and reducing the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican position is that tax cuts are the best way to
ensure continued prosperity _ and that they have the added benefit
of blocking Democrats from spending the money, a course that
Republicans said would be wasteful and economically inefficient.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Reducing income tax rates, Republicans say, would motivate
taxpayers to work harder, since they would keep more of their pay.
Reducing capital gains taxes and expanding the Individual
Retirement Account program would encourage more savings and
investment, helping the economy to retain its technological edge
and become more productive. Scaling back taxes on business would
encourage the creation of new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My preference is that the surpluses be returned as tax cuts so
the government share of the economy will shrink and the private
share of the economy will expand,'' said Lawrence Kudlow, a former
Reagan administration economist who is now with American Skandia,
an investment firm. ``The private sector is governed by market
discipline and the profit motive. Those two factors will generate
more efficiency and more productivity, and hence more economic
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say they are not against tax cuts, and have offered to
go as high as $300 billion over 10 years. That suggests that they
are not overly worried about their worst-case scenario of a mere
$100 billion surplus. But they say any tax reductions should go to
people who need them most, lower and middle income families, and
that they should be used for specific purposes like making college
more affordable or encouraging more retirement savings.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is doing just fine already, Democrats say. They warn
that the additional stimulus of a tax cut could even lead the
economy to overheat, forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   The main Democratic argument against tax cuts, though, is that
there are better things to do with whatever surpluses do
materialize.
</P>
<P>
   One is reducing the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   The two parties are actually not far apart on the benefits of
paying down the debt incurred in the decades in which the federal
government was running huge annual deficits. Democrats, Republicans
and most economists agree that reducing the debt would leave
interest rates lower, stimulating more economic growth, and would
make it easier to address long-term problems like the solvency of
Social Security by easing the financial burden on future
generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing we can do for the economy is to increase
savings, and the best way the government has of increasing savings
is paying down the debt,'' said Robert Bixby, the policy director
of the Concord Coalition, a fiscal monitoring group. ``Reducing the
debt will increase capital investment and productivity, which helps
keep economic growth going.''
</P>
<P>
   The main source of debt reduction is the anticipated $1.9
trillion surplus over the next decade from excess Social Security
payroll taxes. That money is ultimately intended to help pay
retirement benefits for today's workers, but the only way the
government can ``save'' it is to reduce the amount of federal debt
held by the public, now about $3.6 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are generally committed to using the $1.9 trillion
for debt reduction, although they have left open the option of
using some of it to help transform Social Security into a system of
private investment accounts. Although he initially proposed
spending some of it over the next decade, Clinton is now more
firmly committed to using the entire Social Security surplus for
debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are talking about finding additional money for debt
reduction by holding down spending increases after 2002. Clinton
wants to take $374 billion over 10 years from the non-Social
Security surplus for additional debt reduction, although his plan
would in essence just leave the government owing the money to the
Medicare system rather than to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, is one of the most
influential advocates of debt reduction as the best use of the
surplus. Despite his long record of advocating lower taxes _ he
continues to press his case for elimination of the capital gains
tax _ he bluntly warned Republicans last month that the time is not
right for a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said a tax cut would be better suited for a time when
the economy has turned down. And he asserted that the benefits of
consistent debt reduction, in the form of lower-cost capital and
greater investment in productivity-enhancing technology and
machinery, would be the best way of keeping the long economic
expansion going.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan offered one caveat that Republicans seized on _ that
if the only choice is between tax cuts and additional spending,
then his clear preference would be tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite the bipartisan commitments to improving the
government's financial condition, some conservatives are
uncomfortable with too much emphasis on debt reduction, saying it
should not become a fixation that outweighs tax cuts as a priority
for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Many liberals also bemoan the emphasis on the debt and what they
see as a lack of focus on spending for critical areas like
education, basic technology, medical research and transportation.
They say that the continual assault on government spending by
Republicans has led voters to believe that all federal expenditures
are wasteful, and to lose sight of the fact that there is a
substantial return on many types of public investment, from the
development of the Internet to new drugs and better-trained
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1992, Bill Clinton ran on the notion of public investment,
the idea that there were the twin deficits _ the budget deficit and
a deficit in investment in education, health care and research,''
said Robert Reich, who was labor secretary in Clinton's first term.
</P>
<P>
   ``That language seems to have vanished from American politics,''
Reich said. ``It's ironic because the nation is in a far better
position to afford those kinds of investment today than in 1992.''

STARR PLANS FINAL REPORT PRIOR TO 2000 ELECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel,
said Monday that he planned to conclude his long-running
investigation of President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton
before the November 2000 elections by filing a final report.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of such a report could complicate Mrs. Clinton's
likely campaign for a U.S. Senate seat from New York, but Starr
said his office's report would be a dispassionate recitation of the
facts and ``would not engage in characterization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to move forward very, very rapidly in that
respect, and we are doing so,'' Starr told reporters after
addressing a group of lawyers at the American Bar Association
convention in Atlanta. ``I would anticipate that the final report
will come at the earliest practicable moment.''
</P>
<P>
   But Starr refused to discuss whether he had closed out the
possibility of seeking an indictment against either of the
Clintons. ``On that, I'm not going to comment at all,'' he said.
``It would be inappropriate for me to be commenting at all about
the future of the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   He also refused to tell reporters when he would release the
final report that would effectively end his office's inquiry, which
turned five years old last week.
</P>
<P>
   The talk of Starr's final report comes just days after the White
House counsel who fought Clinton's impeachment, Charles F.C. Ruff,
left that job to return to private practice. Ruff's top deputy,
Cheryl Mills, was offered the job of counsel but declined it,
though she said she would stay on as acting counsel until a
replacement can begin the job.
</P>
<P>
   Associates of Starr have said that he has in recent months
decided not to seek an indictment of the president or Mrs. Clinton,
but that he had tentatively decided to issue a scathing final
report about their behavior. One associate of Starr said the report
would be ``blistering'' in its description of Mrs. Clinton's
actions, leaving open the possibility that its release could
inflict political damage to the first lady's Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr went out of his way Monday to dismiss the conclusion
that his office's final report would harshly criticize the
Clintons' actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would need to be a comprehensive final report _ that is
factually straightforward, that does not engage in
characterization,'' Starr explained. ``It's clear that the Congress
did not want a final report to be an avenue for alleging that one
or more individuals had engaged in criminal conduct.''

 &HT;    PGA becomes drive toward an easy Ryder
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ Every other year, it often becomes the more
intriguing aspect to PGA Championship week. The race to win the
season's final major is one thing; the race to the Ryder Cup is
something totally different.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday night, with the Wanamaker Trophy presented, the points
standings will have determined the top 10 players on the U.S. Ryder
Cup team that will play Europe, Sept. 24-26, at The Country Club in
Brookline, Mass. On Monday morning in the Medinah Country Club
media center, Ben Crenshaw will make his two ``captain's picks.''
</P>
<P>
   By Monday afternoon, nobody will be writing about the PGA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's a foregone conclusion, with the 11th and 12th
players almost automatically added to the team. This year, with 300
final points still available at Medinah, the decision is not quite
so clear-cut
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lehman, by moving up to 11th in the standings with a
runner-up finish Sunday at the Buick Open, has all but clinched one
of Crenshaw's spots. But the second selection is hardly set.
Nothing against Steve Stricker, John Huston or Chris Perry (at Nos.
12-14), but Crenshaw seems more likely to pick known Ryder Cup
commodities with more experience.
</P>
<P>
   The second selection might be No. 16 Fred Couples, who gets more
excited about this event than he does about the average PGA Tour
stop, or No. 22 Lee Janzen, the two-time U.S. Open champion and
two-time Ryder Cup participant.
</P>
<P>
   ``My one pick may be fairly obvious,'' Crenshaw said. ``The
other one is obviously going to keep me up at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, who hasn't won on the PGA Tour since the 1996 Tour
Championship, is pained even to thinkof watching a Ryder Cup from
his living room, after appearances at Oak Hill in 1995 and two
years ago at Valderrama. His record is 3-2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Miffed that both events evolved into European victories, Lehman
longs to be part of a potential retribution week at Brookline. Had
he not blown a four-shot lead in the Buick Open, he would have
jumped automatically into the top 10. He needs to finish alone in
ninth place or better this week to lock up a top-10 spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love all that man-on-man stuff,'' Lehman said. ``Ryder Cup,
Presidents Cup, Skins game, Wendy's Three-Tour Challenge _ anything
where it's just you against me.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples, who has made five Ryder Cup appearances, with a 7-9-4
record, might not be all that inspired these days, after inheriting
a family with his second marriage. But Crenshaw said, ``I know
he'll be there enthusiastic, if I call on him.'' Couples would need
a fourth-place finish Sunday to make the top 10 on points.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are subject to second-guessing, the captain's picks
often bring more attention than players making it through the
two-year points process.
</P>
<P>
   Less than thrilled with the recent comments by David Duval and
others about compensation, Crenshaw welcomed contrasting attitudes
from gung-ho players such as Lehman, who said he would pay his own
money to play; Davis Love III; and Payne Stewart, who clinched a
spot on the team at Pinehurst and already is excited about
Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hat's off to (Stewart),'' Crenshaw said. ``Obivously, it's
wonderful for the Ryder Cup to hear his comments. He very much
believes in the competition. I think that's pretty extraordinary at
this time in his life to set a goal like that and achieve it.''

FAITH IN AUTHORITY IS VICTIM OF THAILAND'S ECONOMIC CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ When Sumalee Limpaovart's 6-year-old
daughter was rejected by an exclusive government school earlier
this year, Mrs. Sumalee did something that would have been
unthinkable here only a few years ago: She challenged the decision,
using a new freedom-of-information law to demand the test scores of
the other children.
</P>
<P>
   What started as one mother's private outrage has swelled into a
very public challenge against Thailand's closed and corrupt
bureaucracy, part of a struggle that has turned a society built on
harmony and civility into one that is increasingly argumentative,
litigious and noisy as it searches for democratic change.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Mrs. Sumalee found what she had suspected: Fully
one-third of the students admitted had failed the entrance exam;
they got in because of their families' status or gifts to the
school.
</P>
<P>
   It was just one of the many small, sharp battles that are being
fought today between Thailand's past and its possible future.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle reflects an unexpected fallout from the financial
crisis that struck Asia: the shock of the crash prompted widespread
challenges to the political and social status quo, with a bolder
and better-educated middle class challenging the paternalistic
order of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians and bureaucrats who have been in a position to
impose their top-down rule have to contend now with rising public
expectations and rising public pressure,'' said Kavi Chongkitavarn,
a columnist for the newspaper The Nation.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand has found itself culturally adrift, its landscape
disfigured by expensive half-built highways, empty office
buildings, defunct businesses and ruined banks. Though the worst
seems to be past, Thailand must now lower its sights for future
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Politically and socially, the crash only served to clarify the
issues and sharpen the conflicts, several analysts said. People are
demanding more accountability.
</P>
<P>
   In Thailand, politicians and the public concluded that a
political system hobbled by rigidity, secrecy and corruption had
contributed to its economic vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in countries as disparate as Singapore, Vietnam and
Malaysia, calls for political openness have grown more insistent.
</P>
<P>
   In the tightly controlled democracy of Singapore, an opposition
politician, Chee Soon Juan, has challenged limits on free speech,
drawing quiet support as he speaks out publicly, then serves brief
jail terms for giving a speech without a permit.
</P>
<P>
   In Communist Vietnam, demands for more democracy have
increasingly circulated underground and peasants have rioted
against corruption. The government has responded by arresting
critics but also by holding highly publicized trials of corrupt
officials.
</P>
<P>
   In Malaysia the dismissal and arrest last fall of the former
deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, ignited a huge and unexpected
outpouring of support, suggesting broad discontent with the
country's suppression of civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Most dramatic was the uprising in Indonesia last year, fueled by
both economic and political grievances, that ousted the longtime
strongman, President Suharto, and immediately replaced him with a
thriving, chaotic democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In Thailand a long, slow struggle for democratic reforms took a
big step forward in 1997 with the passage of a new Constitution
that is a blueprint for openness and human rights, a step brought
to the fore in part by the economic decline.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to survey Thai society and say that very little
has changed. Politicians still buy their votes and still represent
wealthy and powerful families and interests. Corruption still
governs life, from law enforcement to the justice system to
government contracts. Wealth and power remain for the most part in
the hands of a small elite.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, primarily because of the new Constitution, the rules of
the game have changed and the country's traditional centers of
power are being challenged:
</P>
<P>
   _The political power of the military has been significantly
reduced. Its procurement activities and secret funds are under
scrutiny. Its control of radio and television is being challenged.
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai took the job of defense minister for
himself, only the second civilian ever to hold the job.
</P>
<P>
   _ The power to issue search and arrest warrants has been taken
from the police and is to be given to the courts, a significant
step in curbing police abuses.
</P>
<P>
   _ An independent Electoral Commission has been formed, removing
the power to manage elections from the powerful and politically
controlled Ministry of Interior.
</P>
<P>
   _ The power of the bureaucracy is to be reduced by a
constitutional mandate for public hearings, though political
analysts foresee a long struggle for full implementation. Pressures
have grown to open up the process of policy formulation to public
oversight.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   _ Women's groups and women in the legislature are pressing for
their rights, beginning with the right of married women to keep
their maiden names. The male-dominated Parliament is resisting
desperately, warning of the destruction of family values.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Thailand is the most exciting country in Asia today
because every day is a battle,'' said William J. Klausner, a
long-time American analyst of Thai culture who is a professor of
political science at Chulalongkorn University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only in the past few years that the Thais have coined
words for transparency, good governance, civil society, public
hearings and sexual harassment,'' he said. ``Every country in Asia
is at some point in this process, with Vietnam and Burma at one
end, the Philippines and Thailand at the other, and Malaysia and
Indonesia in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   That process may have been muted during the decade or more when
economies were growing and people were content with their lot.
There are those who say Thailand lost touch with its values in a
mad dash for wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people not only sold their soul but they sold their
daughters to become prostitutes,'' said Sulak Sivaraksa, a leading
social critic. ``They blindly believed that money would make them
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution may exist on paper in Thailand, but as Mrs.
Sumalee found, every attempt to implement it seems to become a
battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to sound hopeful and optimistic,'' said Suwanna
Satha-Anand, a professor of philosophy at Chulalongkorn University.
``But I come from the perspective of philosophy and tend to see the
deep structures of things. I think cultural conditioning is still
very deep and difficult to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sumalee's challenge involves the potent weapon of public
disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   When she began, her neighbors warned her against her crusade.
``They said, `Don't you know that this is the way things work
here?''' Mrs. Sumalee said. ```Do you think you can change the
system all by yourself?'''
</P>
<P>
   But already another parent has filed a similar
freedom-of-information challenge at a second school. And it now
appears likely that all government-run schools will be required in
the future to open their test scores to the public.

TREASURY YIELDS NEAR 2-YEAR HIGHS WITH BIG AUCTIONS DUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury bond yields continued to move higher Monday,
approaching two-year highs.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 30-year bond fell 23/32, to 86 28/32,
sending its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, to 6.23
percent, from 6.17 percent. Monday's yield was the highest since
Nov. 4, 1997, when it was 6.24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what is driving prices is rising anticipation that the
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its policy meeting on
Aug. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Jones, an economist with Briefing.com, a market analysis
firm in Burlingame, Calif., said Monday that to avert an Aug. 24
tightening of rates, ``we need to see quite a few things go the
market's way.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people active in the bond market fear, however, that this
week's economic reports on retail sales and producer prices will
show stronger economic activity, adding to the Fed's incentive to
raise rates.
</P>
<P>
   Prices are also responding to fears of a glut on the market from
the planned sale this week of $37 billion in the government's
quarterly sale and $3 billion in corporate debt.
</P>
<P>
   Securities firms that have to bid on Treasuries at auction to
maintain their primary-dealer status often sell Treasuries from
their inventory to make room for the new issue, which can drive
yields higher.
</P>
<P>
   And underwriters of large corporate deals often sell Treasuries
ahead of their sales as a hedge against rising rates. This week
DaimlerChrysler is readying a $3 billion issue and Cox
Communications is expected to do a $1.85 billion five-part deal.
</P>
<P>
   Some bond traders say this week's events are likely to keep the
pressure on the bond market and push the yield on the 30-year
benchmark bond to more than 6.30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's weekly bill auction, the three-month Treasury issue
was awarded at an average rate of 4.790 percent, up from 4.695
percent last week. The six-month maturity was awarded at 4.915
percent, up from 4.75 percent.

   WASHINGTON _ Many day-trading firms use deceptive marketing
practices to lure customers into a rapid-fire stock trading
strategy that will probably cause them to lose money, and then they
help to keep them trading by arranging what could be illegal loans,
a group of state securities regulators said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a report condemning many practices of day-trading firms, the
state regulators urged the firms to do a better job of screening
potential customers and to disclose more fully the substantial
risks of their investment practices.
</P>
<P>
   The state group, the North American Securities Administrators
Association, also asked national securities regulators to step up
their enforcement of trading rules and to ban some of the
day-trading industry's most common lending practices.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of firms that promote day trading strongly opposed
the report's conclusions, saying that the results were based on
practices that are not representative of the industry. Rather, the
executives said, the report's conclusions stem from enforcement
actions at a minority of the industry's branch offices.
</P>
<P>
   Day trading drew widespread national attention last month when
Mark Barton shot and killed nine people at the Atlanta offices of
two day-trading firms where he had lost an estimated half a million
dollars trading stocks. The state regulators' report, which had
been in the works for months before the Atlanta shootings, cited
questionable practices at the Massachusetts office of one of those
firms, All-Tech Investment Group, which in December was barred from
doing business in the state for two years. The other firm attacked
by Barton, Momentum Securities, was not cited for questionable
practices, but is one of the nation's largest day-trading firms,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Day trading is generally defined as a strategy in which
individuals make scores of stock trades each day trying to exploit
small movements in share prices. In contrast to most forms of
investing, day traders hold no securities overnight or for longer
terms.
</P>
<P>
   That form of rapid in-and-out trading can produce returns of up
to 12 percent a day for retirees, laid-off executives, college
students and others, according to the promotional materials of some
day-trading firms. But in fact, the regulatory group said, most day
traders lose most if not all of their money within the first few
months.
</P>
<P>
   To keep unsuccessful traders from giving up, day-trading firms
promote and arrange loans from one customer to another, allowing
some traders to cover losses and to continue speculating, the group
said. In one case, a branch manager forged customer signatures on
loan documents, the regulators said, and allegedly had an agreement
to split profits with the customers as part of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Any time they broker a deal between a lender and a customer,
these firms are violating the spirit of rules that prevent
brokerage firms from direct lending, regulators say. Such rules are
designed to keep individuals from trading beyond their means, the
regulators said.
</P>
<P>
   William Galvin, secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
whose office oversees the state's securities regulators, said
day-trading firms that promote lending between customers do so
``using the same rhetoric as bunko artists and Ponzi schemes.''
</P>
<P>
   Day trading is certainly a risky investment practice, but the
report on day trading has several shortcomings that suggest that it
may be more of a snapshot than a comprehensive look at the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being seven months in the making, the report does not
independently quantify how many Americans are practicing day
trading or attempt to determine how much activity they account for
in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   One of the regulatory group's most intriguing findings was that
only 11.5 percent of traders at a single firm in Massachusetts
demonstrated the ability to conduct profitable short-term trading,
while 70 percent lost money. But those results came from an
All-Tech day-trading office that was shut down by Massachusetts
authorities last year for violating securities laws, suggesting
that the firm's customers and their experience may not be typical.
The study examined 30 trading accounts, 17 of which were deemed to
contain true day-trading activity.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Lerner, general counsel of All-Tech Investment Group,
said: ``The Massachusetts office was a bad office being run by a
bad manager. It is not typical.''
</P>
<P>
   Some other findings were based on examinations of 35 day-trading
offices or firms by regulators in four states: Colorado, Texas,
Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. Those examinations have resulted in
13 enforcement orders, and 10 additional investigations are
pending, said David Shellenberger, chief of licensing at the
Massachusetts Securities Division and chairman of the day-trading
task force that prepared the report.
</P>
<P>
   That sample represents a small portion of the day-trading
industry, which the task force said encompasses at least 287 branch
offices serving 62 firms. In March, the Electronic Traders
Association, a trade group headed by Lee of Momentum, said that
4,000 to 5,000 individuals were active day traders, but estimates
vary greatly and it is hard to say how many people are active at
one time and how many people may have multiple accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Shellenberger said that the state group's report was intended
``to relate the collective experience'' of regulators in their
interactions with day-trading firms. ``I think the problems we
found are pervasive in the industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials blasted the report. ``It's such a piece of
trash it's pathetic,'' said Ms. Lerner of All-Tech Investment
Group. To determine profit potential, regulators examined 17
accounts of the firm's defunct Massachusetts office. ``We have more
than 2,000 accounts, so it's hardly a representative sample,'' Ms.
Lerner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Electronic Traders Association said in a statement that it
supported improved disclosure by day-trading firms; in addition, it
issued a statement of ethical principles for its member firms. But
it added that the use of inter-customer loans is longstanding in
the securities industry.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators cited several examples of what they called
misleading marketing. In the case of All-Tech, Massachusetts
regulators found that the firm's branch office manual provided
``guidance to branch managers in overcoming the objections of
prospective customers,'' including being intentionally vague in
discussing ``success ratios,'' or what portion of customers traded
profitably.
</P>
<P>
   Another firm, On-Line Investment Services, claimed on its Web
site ``a success rate of around 85 percent,'' but when asked by the
state securities division for proof of the claim, the firm deleted
the information and denied the claim.
</P>
<P>
   And TCI Corp., a day-trading firm not related to the
better-known cable television company, said on its Web site that
customers earned 12 percent a day before commission. But when
questioned by regulators, the firm admitted that the figure was
based on buy and sell signals posted the week following market
activity _ a practice Massachusetts securities officials deemed
``analogous to predicting the prior week's weather.''
</P>
<P>
   The state regulators said they also intend to shine a brighter
light on loans made between day-trading customers. At one firm,
Landmark Securities, transfers between customer accounts totaled
$2.7 million over a nine-month period. But for some of the loans,
regulators said a branch manager forged customer signatures on
forms approving the transfers.
</P>
<P>
   Other loan practices, while not illegal, raise questions about
whether customers are being fairly advised of their best interests,
the group said. For example, the branch manager of one firm had a
profit interest in the company that made loans to customers.
</P>
<P>
   The state securities group also charged that some of the
inter-customer loans, which entail interest charges of up to 0.1
percent a day _ or 36.5 percent a year _ violate state usury laws.
In addition, some customers do not pay back their loans _ leaving
other customers, rather then the day-trading firm, on the hook.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Monday that he will introduce
legislation to ensure that day traders are aware of the risks
associated with the practice. The proposed legislation will require
a uniform disclosure statement to be signed by all day-trading
customers and prohibit certain types of loans to day traders, he
said. In addition, he said he will call on the Federal Trade
Commission to examine the industry's advertising practices.
</P>
<P>
   The very existence of the day-trading phenomenon is paradoxical,
the state regulators concluded. For individuals who want to
speculate, the futures and options markets present ample
opportunity, at lower cost and greater leverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps day traders are aware that retail customers usually
lose money trading futures and options, so they wish to trade a
seemingly safer vehicle,'' the report states. ``This usually
results in the slower loss of capital, but in loss nonetheless.''

GORE PURSUES BLACK VOTERS IN A TEXAS FORAY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Vice President Al Gore on Monday continued his efforts
to woo black voters as he ventured on another political foray into
Texas, seeking to position himself for what he hopes will be an
eventual presidential race against the Republican front-runner,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Though he never mentioned the governor by name, Gore repeatedly
contrasted himself with Bush by raising issues like gun control,
hate crimes legislation, school vouchers and affirmative action.
Gore also criticized the $792 billion tax cut legislation recently
passed by the Republican-controlled Congress, and endorsed by Bush,
as ``some of the worst handiwork of the Republican right.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the legislation would undermine Social Security and
Medicare. ''It takes courage and conscience to cross those
conservatives who have no compassion,'' Gore said to members of the
National Urban League, who are holding their annual convention in
Houston this week.
</P>
<P>
   The scripted line, which Gore repeated several times during his
speech, was a deliberate rebuke to the ``compassionate
conservatism'' line that has become the early slogan of Bush's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, when he addressed the group in a short
welcoming speech, Bush touted educational reforms in Texas and
talked about the need to help people who have not benefited from
the recent era of prosperity. In front of a group traditionally
sympathetic to Democrats, Bush mentioned ``compassionate'' far more
often than he did ``conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination,
made certain to raise issues of particular concern to his
predominantly black audience. He called on the House to pass a
pending federal hate crimes bill and criticized the Texas
Legislature for failing to pass a similar bill named after a black
man who was tied to a truck and dragged to his death.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he had met with the family of the man, James Byrd Jr.,
earlier in the day. Though Bush never took a position on the
politically sensitive bill, Democrats blamed his legislative allies
for killing it.
</P>
<P>
   With the process about to get underway for conducting the 2000
census, Gore criticized elected officials in both parties who
opposed changing the counting method. Minority groups, in
particular, have said that the census vastly underestimates the
numbers of blacks and Hispanics, and Gore agreed, saying that Texas
alone had missed out on $1 billion in federal benefits because of
an undercount of its minority population.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also called for background checks of people who purchase
weapons at gun shows. Bush also has publicly supported such checks,
but gun control activists in Texas blamed his allies in the
Legislature for killing a bill this year that would have required
them. Bush did sign a law that prohibits Texas cities from filing
liability lawsuits against gun manufacturers. Several other cities
are suing gun makers, seeking reimbursement for health care and
public safety costs for gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who spoke in Houston less than two weeks ago at the
convention of the Hispanic advocacy organization, the National
Council of La Raza, also ticked off a laundry list of unfavorable
statistics about Texas to an audience of people mostly from other
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, here in Texas, can we be satisfied when
African-Americans are twice as likely to drop out of school, when
on a national basis the black and white high school graduation
rates are just about equal?'' he asked. ``Here in Texas, can we be
satisfied when this state has one of the most regressive tax
systems in the nation? Can we possibly be satisfied when Texas has
the second highest percentage of uninsured children in America?''
</P>
<P>
   The criticism is in direct contrast to Bush's standard stump
speech in which he paints Texas not only as an economic dynamo but
also as a state where conservative policies have improved reading
scores, particularly for minority children, and where diversity is
embraced.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Bush, another person that Gore pointedly did not mention
by name was former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who is also
running for the Democratic presidential nomination and who is
scheduled to address the National Urban League on Tuesday. In his
campaign, Bradley has spoken often about race and has made several
overtures to black voters. Last weekend, both he and Gore addressed
the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition in Chicago at a conference organized by
the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Gore reminded his audience Monday of what he described as the
benefits gained by minorities under the Clinton administration,
citing a string of African-American Cabinet appointees and policies
such as empowerment zones and federal loan programs for minority
businesses.

STAGE MUSICAL PAYS TRIBUTE TO WOMEN OF FILM'S SILENT ERA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Given Hollywood's historic infatuation with
expensive high-tech toys, it makes perfect sense to Estelle Parsons
that the silent-film era, like the present age, was dominated by
men.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so much a man's world then,'' says the veteran
Oscar-winning actress, speaking of the industry's infancy. ``Like
with computers (today), it's certainly not a woman's world. Men
characteristically are much more interested in tinkering with any
kind of inanimate object!''
</P>
<P>
   That cheerful thought prompts a sudden explosion from Parsons, a
sound roughly between a cackle and a deranged howitzer.
</P>
<P>
   It also draws a laugh from composer Jeanine Tesori, who has
joined Parsons in a backstage discussion of ``The First Picture
Show,'' a musical play that klieg-lights the silent era's most
unsung but currently hottest heroes: women directors and
screenwriters.
</P>
<P>
   In the show, which opens a six-week run Wednesday at the Mark
Taper Forum, Parsons plays feisty 99-year-old Anne First, a former
Hollywood director and silent film pioneer, now confined to an
old-folks' home.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of her female colleagues, Anne was shoved aside by
male studio honchos when the talkies arrived and movies
metamorphosed from a curiosity into a highly lucrative business.
</P>
<P>
   With a score by Tesori that melds Victorian parlor tunes,
vaudeville, Tin Pan Alley and classical music, ``The First Picture
Show'' is co-authored and jointly directed by David Gordon and Ain
Gordon, the father-son team known for their multimedia, avant
garde-ish assemblages of text-based performance, dance movement and
music.
</P>
<P>
   Originally commissioned by the Mark Taper, the show is a
co-production with the American Conservatory Theater in San
Francisco, where it was presented earlier this year. In Los
Angeles, the cast of 14 will portray 40 different characters. Ellen
Greene portrays Anne in her younger years and also plays her
great-great-niece, a documentary filmmaker determined to tell the
old woman's story.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of women in early Hollywood has consumed large vats
of critical ink lately. A number of recent biographies have
detailed the contributions to film of women directors such as Lois
Weber and Alice Guy Blache (quite possibly the first director, of
any gender, to helm a narrative film) and screenwriters Frances
Marion, Anita Loos, Tess Slesinger and others. Earlier this summer,
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art presented a film series
devoted to some of their works.
</P>
<P>
   But a few years ago, when the Gordons first started talking with
Taper producing artistic director Gordon Davidson about a new show
focusing on censorship in the silent-movie era, they envisioned
their main character as a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're guys, and so we thought of guys,'' Ain Gordon explains
with self-amusement. ``And then I went off to Lincoln Center
looking for information about the censorship, and really I just was
kind of scanning the bookshelves, trying to see what was there. And
I just saw this book that said, `Early Women Directors.' And I sort
of blithely said, `What early women directors? There weren't any.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I pulled it out of the shelf and found that I was not only
totally wrong but not knowledgeable and a fool! And I called David
and said, `There are all these women, and I think we should change
the character to a woman.'''
</P>
<P>
   What shocked the Gordons was the sheer number of women working
in silent-era Hollywood. Though vastly outnumbered by their male
colleagues, a few of these women were incredibly prolific and
financially successful. The Paris-born Blache (1875-1968), for
example, produced, directed and otherwise oversaw nearly 300 films,
primarily between 1896 and 1920, an astonishing number that puts
her in a class with D.W. Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew? Not, she admits, composer Tesori.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't until David and Ain gave me all of these incredibly
thick books to read'' that Tesori says she began to comprehend
women's early contributions to film.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Tesori says, because silent movies were still a
game with no rules, women weren't compelled to limit themselves to
weepy melodramas or other stereotypically ``feminine'' genres. They
did everything their male peers were doing: comedies, action films,
historical movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was Lois Weber who started in New Jersey and did
these incredible train shots where she was shooting it from a
car,'' Tesori says. ``The picture I saw, it was really moving! They
were going literally alongside the track.''
</P>
<P>
   Parsons, like Tesori, was unfamiliar with early women filmmakers
when she first read the show's script. But she had no trouble
relating personally to the challenges they faced.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has spent the better part of her career on stage,
Parsons, 71, is primarily known to general audiences for her role
as Roseanne's irascible mother on the highly rated sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two years ago, she won a best supporting actress Oscar as
the hysterical Blanche in the 1967 ``Bonnie and Clyde,'' an honor
that Parsons has said ``didn't mean a thing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in a previous career, Parsons broke ground as the nation's
first female political reporter for a TV network when the ``Today''
show went on the air. At that time, television was considered an
upstart business not to be taken very seriously _ much as the
movies had been half a century earlier. Consequently, the industry
briefly opened its doors to women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very much like (the early days of silent movies), where
whoever was there just did stuff,'' Parsons says. ``And then it
gets more and more stratified or something, codified, organized.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of funny, because when women's lib came, there was
this little sense of, `Oh, you're all going to do what I did, and
I'm special because I did it?!'''
</P>
<P>
   Tesori also has a first-hand sense of what it's like blazing
show-biz trails. She belongs to the tiny sorority of women writers
working in the Broadway musical theater, a group that also includes
lyricist Lynn Ahrens (``Ragtime'') and director Julie Taymor (``The
Lion King'').
</P>
<P>
   A former Broadway conductor, Tesori made her musical theater
breakthrough two years ago with ``Violet,'' with lyrics and book by
Brian Crawley. Inspired by Doris Betts' short story ``The Ugliest
Pilgrim,'' it tells of a young woman whose determination to heal a
disfiguring facial scar leads to a journey of spiritual salvation.
It opened in March 1997 at Playwrights Horizons in New York City
and went on to win the New York Drama Critics Circle Award for best
new musical.
</P>
<P>
   Tesori's score, with its ambitious blending of elements of
bluegrass, gospel, country and pop, caught the Gordons' attention
around the time they started working on ``The First Picture Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The show was a lot about women, and we thought it would be
nice if part of the creative team was a woman,'' Ain Gordon says.
``I had some friends who had worked with her (Tesori), and we
talked to lots of people, but we were very interested in her. We
were very lucky. We wooed her.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Parsons, the actress was cast soon after she read the
scipt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Estelle Parsons was interested in (you), would you say
no?'' David Gordon asks, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Parsons' stature as a grand dame of the American stage
is matched by her reputation as an exacting straight-shooter with a
peppery wit. Even Tesori, no shrinking violet herself, says that
Parsons ``used to terrify me'' at first.
</P>
<P>
   But the two women immediately found they shared a style of
working that involved hammering out ideas non-stop and defending
them vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   Tesori also says that, as a new mother, she particularly admires
Parsons for juggling a show-biz career with a family (Parsons and
her lawyer husband have twin daughters, now 34, and a 16-year-old
son, Abraham).
</P>
<P>
   During pre-production, Parsons and Tesori discussed whether a
woman like Anne First could've looked to any older career women for
inspiration. Probably not, they concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I read about women's success, and this is my own
prism perhaps, I always want to know do they have kids,'' Tesori
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I am truly, mostly inspired by people who do that,
because I think that's being an artist in two ways. And you know, I
look at people like Estelle and I see Abraham and he's a great kid
and I think, `OK, I'm going to keep going.' &UR;  &LR; '' &UR;

 &HT;    Ole Miss: Cutcliffe has heart of a Rebel
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mississippi coach David Cutcliffe lists it as one of
the strangest and most agonizing experiences of his career.
</P>
<P>
   His team, the Tennessee Volunteers, was playing Florida State
for the national championship, and he was sitting by himself on a
couch in a rented house in Oxford, Miss., watching the game on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched the first half by myself, which was strange and kind
of agonizing,'' said Cutcliffe, a 17-year Tennessee assistant
before taking over the Rebels in December when Tommy Tuberville
left to become Auburn's head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, I couldn't take it anymore. I called (former
Tennessee quarterback) Jerry Colquitt at halftime and told him to
come over and watch it with me. . . . It was an emotional time for
me because of all the relationships I had with those coaches and
those players.''
</P>
<P>
   But whatever agony Cutcliffe might have suffered because of the
Vols' win didn't compare with the relief his new players felt when
he was hired.
</P>
<P>
   Cutcliffe, who accepted the job the Monday before Tennessee's
appearance in the SEC Championship Game on Dec. 5, elected to start
the next week. Not coincidentally, the Rebels accepted a bid to
play in the Independence Bowl a short time later.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cutliffe might not have realized it at the time, his
decision to forgo possibly winning a national title to begin his
work with the Rebels sent a clear message to the Ole Miss players.
</P>
<P>
   ``That meant everything in the world to us,'' senior offensive
lineman Todd Wade said. ``It showed that he was dedicated and
committed to being our coach. I don't know what we would've done if
he hadn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior linebacker Armegis Spearman said: ``That was one of the
biggest things that sold all the players on him as our coach. I
think about it myself, and I'm not sure if I wouldn't have gone to
the championship. That was probably one of the most difficult
decisions of his life, and I respect him for making the one that he
did.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision was significant to Cutcliffe in several ways. Not
only was he able to learn about his new team and personnel, he also
was able to get a leg up on recruiting and prove himself to the Ole
Miss faithful. The Rebels thumped Texas Tech 35-18 in the
Independence Bowl, and Cutcliffe's head-coaching career was off to
a flying start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made all the difference in the world,'' Cutcliffe said. ``I
say a prayer of thanks every day that I had a chance to coach that
bowl game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rebels' success in Shreveport, La., only fueled the high
expectations for this season. Ole Miss returns 17 starters from
last year's 7-5 squad and is sanction-free and back to a full
allotment of 85 scholarships for the first time in four years,
after NCAA probation.
</P>
<P>
   At the SEC Football Kickoff last month, Mississippi received 11
first-place votes to win the SEC West Cutcliffe is guarded about
his team's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably a chaser,'' he said. ``We're not a team that
has won a championship or tied for one or even been in a race for
it. So, we have to go out and prove ourselves every Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rebels appear to have the talent to be able to stay in the
race. Among the eight returnees on offense are quarterback Romaro
Miller, who passed for 2,273 yards last year; running back Deuce
McAllister, who became only the second back in school history to
rush for more than 1,000 yards, 1,082; and Wade, a 6-foot-7,
320-pound tackle who earned preseason All-SEC honors.
</P>
<P>
   The defense returns nine starters, led by Spearman, who also was
a preseason All-SEC selection, and senior tackle Kendrick Clancy,
who ``nobody could block in the spring,'' Cutcliffe said.
</P>
<P>
   As for missing the Vols' championship game, Cutcliffe said he's
over that. A little gift from Phillip Fulmer helped the healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I did get a championship ring,'' Cutcliffe said, holding
up the ring finger of his right hand, ``and I'm very proud of it.''

CLINTON URGES SENATE TO END ITS SLOWDOWN OF JUDICIAL CONFIRMATIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Declaring a ``mounting vacancy crisis'' exists in the
federal courts, President Clinton on Monday pressed the
Republican-led Senate to end its slowdown of judicial
confirmations.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom on
former President Carter and his wife, Rosalynn.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took aim at the Senate during an address to the American
Bar Association, where he accused the GOP of returning to the
political foot-dragging that marked the 1996 presidential election
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply cannot afford to allow political considerations to
keep our courts vacant and to keep justice waiting,'' Clinton told
the attorneys, adding he would make a renewed push for
confirmations once Congress returns from its August recess.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, halted the confirmation process for six months this year
to force Clinton to nominate a conservative Republican ally, Ted
Stewart, to the Utah bench.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton submitted Stewart's name last month and Hatch's panel
sent the nomination to the floor within 48 hours, far faster than
usual. Some circuit court seats have been vacant for 16 months.
Stewart's nomination, opposed by environmental groups, remains
pending on the Senate calendar.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination process also will likely become entangled in the
2000 presidential campaign. Republicans, if they follow past
patterns of the congressional majority, may become hesitant to act
on judicial confirmations in hope that a GOP candidate will win the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he has made 61 judicial nominations and the Senate
has confirmed 11 and an additional 13 have been reported out of
committee. He said 16 of the 61 vacancies are in jurisdictions
where emergencies have been declared because of the high case
loads.
</P>
<P>
   He likened the Senate slowdown to the political calculations
made in 1996 when Republicans confirmed only 17 judges and refused
to confirm any nominations for the circuit courts during the
election year. There are 800 federal judicial positions.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the high vacancy rates and growing case loads
prompted Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist to warn the
Senate that it was undermining the legal system. Clinton
acknowledged that after Rehnquist's warnings Hatch worked with the
administration in a bipartisan effort to fill 65 vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no sooner had we begun to remedy the rising emergency
than, once again, the politics of the Senate began to stop the
confirmation process in its track,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The ABA rallied behind Clinton's call as five former ABA
presidents sent a letter to Senate leaders calling for an end to
``this unprecedented slowdown'' because of the expense and delay
caused in federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   The ABA letter also said minority and women judicial candidates
are being disproportionately affected. It noted that of the 10
nominations pending for more than one year, seven are either
minorities or women. Of the 11 judges confirmed this year, eight
are white men, it noted.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Clinton traveled to the Carter Center where he pinned
the Medal of Freedom on the former president and his wife. The
citation praised the Carters for their ``extraordinary
partnership'' in devoting their lives to human rights, democracy,
health care and women's rights around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter have done more good things for more
people in more places than any other couple on the face of the
Earth,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter called the ceremony ``one of the most beautiful events of
my life.'' He also playfully jabbed Clinton for his upcoming
retirement, suggesting an ex-president's golfing partners are not
so generous with mulligans.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, a one-term president defeated in his 1980 re-election
bid by Ronald Reagan, said he and his wife left Washington ``in
something of despair and embarrassment and disappointment and
frustration'' but found a new life in bringing ``the blessings of
America'' to those hungry for freedom and democracy around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people have given us unlimited chances, unlimited
opportunities,'' said Rosalynn Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will present the same award later this week to former
President Ford and to former Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen. The Medal of
Freedom is the highest civilian honor bestowed by the government.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Once again Boris Yeltsin has played a difficult and
dangerous game _ sacking our country's prime minister. And now our
best analytical minds are considering what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, as everybody knows here, a career is often made
in Russia by those who do nothing to make it. For instance, it is
known for certain that Yevgeny M. Primakov, our second-to-the-last
prime minister, had never wanted the post. In 1996, when spoken to
about running in the national elections, he flatly refused.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was precisely his several months of premiership, at the
forceful behest of Yeltsin, that led Russia to trust him. Or maybe
it was Primakov's special talent to lull Russia into a sense of
security?
</P>
<P>
   Oh well, that's history. We've been through three prime
ministers in the last year and a half _ and now the fourth. We've
seen the firing of Primakov, the ascendancy of Sergei V. Stepashin,
and now, three months later, yet a new move on the chess board. It
must have come as a nasty surprise to Stepashin, 47, who has been
loyal to Yeltsin _ the news was only announced to him in the
Kremlin very early in the morning on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Let this be said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's next president will take over a free but semi-bankrupt
state, overburdened by its social obligations to the people. This
is a constant. Yeltsin cannot wave away the problems on the streets
of Moscow and St. Petersburg as he can wave his hand and make a
prime minister _ or even a whole State Duma _ disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the buzzing in the Kremlin halls had already begun.
Those insiders were saying that a decision was about to be made as
to which would be better _ to start yet another difficult and
perilous move to remove the prime minister, who was being seen as
weak, or to call an all-Russia referendum simultaneously with
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose? A rescue operation to keep Yeltsin in control of
the next presidential race. A mission to control who succeeds him.
A major effort to keep a Yeltsin-backed candidate from being
trounced by the strengthening opposition force, which is an
alliance of several regional leaders, now led by Primakov and
Moscow Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve this ``rescue,'' a tough scenario was already
emerging behind the scenes. It was being presumed that the post of
head of government would be offered to someone outside the Russian
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Although this new Monday massacre is a shock in the West, for
several weeks now in Russia, the media have been citing the name of
a rising candidate: Vladimir V. Putin, 46, the man who last week
was director of the domestic security service (FSB), an arm of the
Cold War-era KGB, and secretary of the president's Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, this is a reverse. Since Primakov was abruptly
dismissed three months ago, top Kremlin officials have been saying
all but openly that Stepashin was destined to become Yeltsin's
successor.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to our sources, Naina Yeltsin, the president's
wife, and Pavel Borodin, the influential head of the presidential
Property Management Administration, were actively trying to
persuade Yeltsin to choose Putin. Their arguments: Putin is more
decisive than Stepashin and, moreover, as a former deputy Kremlin
administrator in charge of relations with Russia's regional
governments, Putin enjoys the support of the very power structure
now lining up in support of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the sack-Stepashin, elevate-Putin scenario is that
Yeltsin will dissolve the Duma, if in fact, it takes the requisite
three votes and turns Putin down every time. The members are
returning from summer break next week, and will take their first
vote. They may well vote no _ out of obstinacy, rebellion against
Yeltsin, frustration at the line of prime ministers or just because
they don't like Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Should Putin fail three times, Yeltsin might very well resign,
leaving Putin, appointed by his decree, constitutionally the legal
acting president. Thus, despite the Duma, Putin would have what
Yeltsin really wants for him: an excellent jumping-off ground for
the July 2000 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   This scenario, however, could well be little more than a
``Kremlin horror story'' designed to strike terror into the Kremlin
opponents. Then again, as the world is now aware, step one _ the
sacking of Stepashin _ has already occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Russia, the Communists, led by Gennadi Zyuganov, who
would favor the Primakov option, are already shaking in their
boots. Party members were seriously assuring your correspondent
last week that the Moscow police already had held an exercise in
the outlying suburb of Mitino, in full riot gear, ready for the
worst, a public rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus also
apparently promised Yeltsin to send in his own republic's police
force, should violence erupt, because at this point the Moscow
police are find of Luzhkov, the populist mayor.
</P>
<P>
   If the Kremlin is indeed considering a scenario based on the use
of force, it would only be as a kind of last resort exotica. No
doubt, Yeltsin is pinning far greater hopes on a peaceful shift,
hoping that the Russian people will, once again, remain stalwart
and passive.
</P>
<P>
   Either a forceful or a peaceful option would have the same
objective, however: to get a man such as Putin in, and in a
position strong enough to defeat a Primakov-Luzhkov ticket.

TRADING IS SLUGGISH AS MARKET LABORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A sharp rise in long-term interest rates battered
Internet and technology stocks again Monday, pushing the Nasdaq
composite index down for the seventh time in eight sessions.
</P>
<P>
   During a sluggish trading session, the main market gauges staged
small, intermittent rallies that could not be sustained.
</P>
<P>
   ``This market is laboring,'' said Andrew Brooks, head of equity
trading at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore. ``It tried to
rally a bunch of times, but then faltered. And until we get a
clearer read from the Fed about when they are finished raising
interest rates, this sort of activity is likely to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve policy-makers are widely expected to raise
short-term interest rates at their next meeting, on Aug. 24, and
bond traders have been pushing up long-term bond yields ahead of
that session.
</P>
<P>
   In a further negative response to strong July employment data
that were released on Friday, the yield on the benchmark 30-year
bond rose as high as 6.25 percent and settled at 6.23 percent, its
highest level since Nov. 4, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Segments of the stock market weathered the rise in rates, but
technology and Internet stocks were punished.
</P>
<P>
   As one consequence, the Nasdaq, which is heavily laden with
technology issues, fell 28.99 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,518.98.
With the decline, the Nasdaq is down 12 percent from its peak on
July 16, and in the midst of a correction. Wall Street defines a
correction as a selloff of 10 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks fared even worse. TheStreet.com's Internet index
fell 18.36 points, or 3.7 percent, to 480.03.
</P>
<P>
   Weakness in technology companies like Cisco Systems, MCI
Worldcom and EMC also pulled down the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index somewhat; it fell 2.49 points, or two-tenths of 1 percent, to
1,297.80.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average slipped, but its decline was
limited because of strength in stocks like Alcoa, General Motors,
Goodyear and financial companies. The blue-chip index dropped 6.33
points, or less than a tenth of 1 percent, to 10,707.70.
</P>
<P>
   Small company stocks continued to struggle. The Russell 2000
index of smaller companies fell 2.15 points, or five-tenths of a
percent, to 425.89.
</P>
<P>
   Market strategists said the slide was likely to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have moved from a declining interest rate and inflation
environment to an environment in which interest rates and inflation
are rising,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First
Albany Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very, very different environment from the last four
years, and the market is marking down prices to reflect that
change,'' he added. ``And the essential message is that the
adjustment process is not finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, declining stocks on the New York Stock Exchange
outpaced advancing issues, this time by a ratio of 3-to-2. Trading
volume on the Big Board was light, at 684.4 million shares. On
Nasdaq, 748.2 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next month, said Nora McAuley-Gitin, a technical
strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co., the Dow could test
its June lows of about 10,400 points. If it breaks through that
level, it could fall as low as 10,000, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Among individual stocks, MCI Worldcom fell 3 13/16, to 77 7/16
after the long-distance carrier said it would offer evening
telephone calls for 5 cents a minute. The step follows a similar
move made three weeks ago by its rival, Sprint Corp., and analysts
said a new round of price cuts in the long-distance market could
ensue.
</P>
<P>
   EMC, which said Monday that it had agreed to buy Data General
for $1.22 billion in debt and stock, stumbled after the deal was
announced. EMC closed at 57 1/4 a share, down 2 3/4; Data General
soared 4 5/16, to 17 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Chip makers were the best performers among technology stocks
Monday. Advanced Micro Devices rose 1 7/8 a share, to 19 1/4, after
it introduced its new Athlon microprocessor to compete with Intel's
fastest chips. Intel, which has bucked the trend among technology
companies recently, continued to power ahead. The stock closed at
73 7/16, up 1 7/8. And Applied Materials gained 3 3/16, to 77 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   Big losers among Internet stocks included Yahoo, which fell 5
3/4 a share, to 121 3/16; Amazon.com, which dropped 4 1/16, to 85
1/2, and Ebay, which lost 3 5/8, to 79 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   Among Dow stocks, Alcoa gained 3 a share, to 65 5/8. GM rose 2
1/4, to 62 1/2. And J.P. Morgan closed at 124 15/16, up 2.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont, though, fell after the chemical maker said the number of
shares in its Conoco exchange offer exceeded the number it planned
to accept and that it would prorate the offer. Investors who bought
DuPont earlier with the idea of converting shares into Conoco might
sell those shares if they are left out of the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont fell 2 3/4, to 71 1/8. Conoco rose 3/4, to 26 5/8.

GORE HAMMERS AT BUSH'S STANCE ON INCOME TAX CUTS 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Vice President Al Gore bashed Gov. George W. Bush's
position on income tax cuts Monday but said it was too early in the
presidential campaign to utter Bush's name.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he disagrees with Bush about helping disadvantaged
people, Gore cited Bush's support for the $792 billion tax-cut bill
passed by the Republican-led Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really beyond me how any serious candidate for president
could countenance support for a proposal of that kind. It's
reckless,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the leading candidate for the Democratic presidential
nomination in 2000, took his party's line that the tax cut would
unjustly benefit the rich. President Clinton has pledged to veto
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the leading candidate for the Republican nomination for
president, has said he supports the GOP tax-cut bill as the best
way to share the surplus with taxpayers. But after hearing that the
bill also includes a plan for the states to return some money to
the federal government, Bush expressed general support this weekend
for allowing states to keep their money.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidate Elizabeth Dole also said
Clinton should sign the tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's remarks about Bush's policies tracked his speech a few
moments earlier to the National Urban League convention in Houston.
Without mentioning Bush by name, he highlighted his disagreements
with the governor on gun control, hate-crime legislation and other
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Although the vice president's campaign aides have said for weeks
that Gore has trained his sights on Bush, and Gore's remarks have
been widely reported as criticisms of Bush, the vice president said
that it is too early for him to attack Bush by name.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the holster fits, wear it. If the shoe fits, wear it. Well,
that phrase is a rhetorical phrase that invites you to fill in the
blanks,'' Gore said. ``I just don't feel that we are at the point
in this campaign yet where (using Bush's name) feels appropriate to
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing more complicated than that. Just a gut feeling on my
part,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Bush clobbers Gore in national voter polls on a would-be general
election match-up.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore said he was pleased with this showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy being an underdog,'' he said. ``I am perfectly happy
with where I am 15 months from the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that in his first race for public office, for a U.S.
House seat from Tennessee in 1976, he was expected to finish ``back
in the pack'' behind a leader of the state legislature. Gore, whose
father was a U.S. senator from Tennessee, won the race.
</P>
<P>
   Underdog status aside, Gore said ``there is occasionally a gap''
between how voters feel and how he is being portrayed by the
national media: as a vexed and bumbling candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think that's fine,'' he remarked. ``I have no
complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore dodged questions about whether he will try during the
Clinton administration to outlaw ``racial profiling,'' the police
practice of identifying possible criminal suspects based solely on
their race.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has promised to end the policy if elected president.
Democratic opponent Bill Bradley has suggested that Gore should
press Clinton to carry out the deed now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you'll have to ask the president that,'' Gore said when
asked about Bradley's statement. ``The Justice Department has a
number of options under review, and I could give you my position. 
would make it the first civil-rights act of the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   But will Gore encourage Clinton to sign an executive order that
puts a ban into place?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, he (Clinton) has done more to advance the case of
civil rights than any president since Lyndon Johnson,'' Gore
responded. ``I think that his record is one that withstands any
scrutiny or attack. As for the state of his dialogue with the
Justice Department, you'll just have to ask him.''

HIGH OIL PRICES MAY BRING WINDFALL FOR IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Rising world oil prices coupled with a big
increase in its production could earn Iraq a record $6.3 billion in
the current six-month phase of the program that allows it to sell
oil to raise money for food, medicines and other civilian goods,
officials and diplomats said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the windfall, the government refuses to spend more
on childhood nutrition and maternal health, ignoring the advice of
U.N. officials, the executive director of the United Nations Iraq
program, Benon Sevan, has told the Security Council. And medical
supplies remain stockpiled in warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   Sevan said he had asked the Iraqi government on a recent trip
there to take an inventory and explain why goods had not moved.
</P>
<P>
   Unicef and the Iraqi government have recently completed a survey
of children's health that is expected to show a steep deterioration
since the Persian Gulf war in 1991 and the imposition of
international sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the findings is being held up by the Iraqis, U.N.
officials say. Some suggest that it will show greater advances in
nutrition and maternal health in Kurdish areas of northern Iraq,
where the United Nations has been running the program, than in the
regions where Iraqis have been in charge.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of July, Iraq was pumping an average of 2.84 million
barrels of oil a day, according to Bridge News London, a specialist
news service. That brings Iraq close to its target of 3 million
barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding subsidized sales to neighboring Jordan and oil for
Iraq's own use, the output leaves oil worth about $2.3 billion for
export in the six-month period that ends in November. Oil prices
have more than doubled in the last six months, and if they remain
high, in the $19 to $20 a barrel range, Iraq could outdo even the
most optimistic projections.
</P>
<P>
   The prices have risen in part because the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which Iraq is a member, has taken
action to limit oil output.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, known as oil for food, Iraq is permitted to
sell up to $5.2 billion in a six-month period. Until now Iraq has
not been able to meet the target, and diplomats expect that
previous shortfalls will be taken into account and the Iraqis will
not be penalized if they exceed the limit.
</P>
<P>
   A third of the money goes to compensate victims of Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, and a fixed amount is also set
aside for aid to the Kurdish regions.
</P>
<P>
   The program began in 1996 _ nearly five years after it was first
offered to President Saddan Hussein, who held out instead for an
end to sanctions _ and more than $3.4 billion in food and $700
million in medicines and medical equipment have reached Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis and key U.N. officials say that to raise public
health standards, Iraq must also rebuild or improve electricity
supplies and sanitation services. But numerous Iraqi requests to
buy machinery for these programs has met resistance in the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Sevan wrote to the chairman of the sanctions
committee with a long list of items Iraq wants to buy that have
been blocked by the United States and occasionally by Britain. But
American officials contend that many of the items that Washington
has put on hold are suspect because they have more than one
potential use and could be intended for weapons programs.

BUYING STAMPS CAN NOW MEAN JUST A TRIP TO THE COMPUTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Beginning another chapter in the history of mail,
the U.S. Postal Service on Monday announced the nationwide
availability of postage that customers can buy over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The stamps downloaded from cyberspace, to be called PC Postage,
are the first new form of postage since the advent of the postage
meter in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service will not offer the digital stamps itself, but
instead will rely on the private sector. Postal officials said
Monday that two start-up companies, E-Stamp Corp. and Stamps.com,
which have been selling the electronic stamps on a test basis, can
now sell their products nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Stamp purchasers will pay for their postage with credit cards
and then will be able to print a special barcode that can be put on
an envelope. Each barcode has a unique digital signature to prevent
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life just became a little bit easier for those who mail,''
said Pam Gibert, a Postal Service vice president. ``With PC
Postage, you can purchase and print postage 24 hours a day, 7 days
a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who use the digital postal service are expected to
be small and medium-sized businesses. Both E-Stamp and Stamps.com
will charge a fee _ about 10 percent _ in addition to the cost of
the stamp.
</P>
<P>
   Two other companies, Pitney Bowes and Neopost, are also offering
the electronic stamps on a test basis and are hoping to eventually
be approved by the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Postal Service announced it was accepting proposals
for the digital delivery of postage, setting off a race among
several start-up companies eager to cash in on the Internet market.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service's invitation was based loosely on a design
created by E-Stamp of San Mateo, Calif. E-Stamp's plan requires the
customer to buy a small device that attaches to the back of a
computer.
</P>
<P>
   But Stamps.com, which is located in Santa Monica, Calif., gained
an advantage when it proposed a system with no special hardware
required.
</P>
<P>
   And at least one former postmaster general, Marvin Runyon, who
retired in early 1998, has put his money on Stamps.com. Runyon
invested in the company in February and became a director on the
company's board. The company would not disclose how much Runyon
invested.
</P>
<P>
   Stamps.com sold its first shares of stock to the public in the
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Fournier, a health insurance broker in Novato, Calif., has
been using the electronic postage since December. Fournier
estimates that the digital stamps have saved him at least 16 hours
that he otherwise would have spent standing in line at the post
office.
</P>
<P>
   He said that when he shows up at the post office with a package,
the postal employees often gather around admiring the electronic
stamp. ``They say, `Boy, that's neat,''' he said.

PRAISING THE REFORM PARTY, BUCHANAN UNNERVES GOP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., N.H.)   By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Pat Buchanan praised the Reform Party Monday
in the strongest signal thus far that he is considering seeking
that party's presidential nomination and bolting the Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who is now competing for the Republican presidential
nomination, was particularly complimentary of Gov. Jesse Ventura of
Minnesota, the Reform Party's highest ranking elected official, who
could himself seek its presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The election of Jesse Ventura was a very healthy thing for
American politics,'' Buchanan said in response to a question from
the audience after he announced his proposals for family farms.
``It keeps these other parties on their toes.''
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the Reform Party, he said, ``is a reflection of the
fact that the two national parties in Washington, D.C., are more
and more beginning to look like two wings of the same old party,
with the differences between them almost inconsequential.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``There's a vacuum in American politics and third
parties have begun to fill them.''
</P>
<P>
   Questioned by reporters after the event, Buchanan refused to
rule out the prospect that he could leave the Republican Party. He
acknowledged that his sister and close adviser, Bay Buchanan, has
talked to Reform Party officials about the possibility that he
might leave the Republican fold. ``My sister talked to somebody
three or four weeks ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, a conservative television commentator, was
uncharacteristically tight-lipped when asked about his intentions.
He suggested that rival campaigns were spreading rumors about a
defection to discredit him in the run-up to a straw poll in Ames,
Iowa, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders said they were concerned that if Buchanan
makes a third-party run he would deprive their party's eventual
nominee of precious support from conservatives. They said they were
far more unnerved by Buchanan's prospective desertion than that
earlier this summer of Sen. Robert C. Smith of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Smith quit the presidential campaign and Republican Party,
saying the party had abandoned its principles. But the senator is
far less prominent than Buchanan, who has twice before waged
insurgent bids for the Republican nomination. Republican leaders
recalled that Buchanan has long been a devoted Republican who was
an aide in the Nixon White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident that Pat Buchanan loves his party and, like
Ronald Reagan, that he would try to change it from the inside of
doing anything to hurt it,'' said David Israelite, the Republican
National Committee's political director.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Buchanan sought to join the Reform Party, his nomination
would be far from assured. The party is already troubled with
tensions between Ventura and its founder, Ross Perot, who lost his
effort to install his own candidate to head the party.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Buchanan's hard-edged conservative stands on issues
like abortion and gay rights contrast with the Reform Party's more
libertarian streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat Buchanan, I don't believe, is necessarily a good fit
because Pat Buchanan puts social issues on the front burner,''
Ventura said on Sunday on the CBS News program ``Face the Nation.''
``We in the Reform Party do not put social issues as a
front-burning item. We're more into the normal political government
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps in a nod to Ventura, a former professional wrestler,
Buchanan Monday likened Republicans and Democrats to wrestlers. He
said the leading Republican contender, Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, held positions that closely resembled those of President
Clinton on issues like immigration, trade policy and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a professional wrestling match, when one fellow wins
one week and the other wins the next week,'' Buchanan said. ``And
they go out and have a couple of beers after the wrestling match is
over.''

 &HT;    Anderson set for face-to-face at camp
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ The great holdout may be about to end.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons All-Pro running back Jamal Anderson and agent Jim Sims
are expected to meet today or Wednesday with coach Dan Reeves and
general manager Harold Richardson in an attempt to get the player
in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is seeking a new contract, and Sims said he's willing
to drop his request for an $8 million signing bonus to about $7.5
million to end the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Richardson) said if Jamal shows some commitment to wanting to
be there, he would consider the structure we (last) talked about,''
said Sims, who cut short a European vacation and on Friday faxed
another proposal to Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Jamal, `If they want to see you, you should go.' He's
not going to go to practice. If we don't get a deal done, or don't
see they're committed, we'll turn around and leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves anticipated meeting today with Anderson and Sims, but
learned late Monday that Sims may not make it from Oakland until
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson arrived in Atlanta from Salt Lake City before dawn
Monday, and could show up at camp today.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to hear it face to face. I don't know what
difference that makes,'' Reeves said of the team's most recent
offer for a five-year deal worth about $28 million with a $7
million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Visiting training camp is not good faith. Coming in here and
working out, living up to your contract, that's good faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The final year of Anderson's contract calls for $2.6 million in
salary and bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   There is general agreement on a new five-year deal worth $28
million to $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson originally sought a $10 million signing bonus. The
Falcons offered about $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Sims reduced the bonus request to about $8 million;
the Falcons moved toward $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves froze contract talks July 28, the day before training
camp, saying there would be no movement until Anderson showed.
</P>
<P>
   Until Monday, Anderson and Sims said the player wouldn't show up
without a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   They are now looking for a signing bonus of around $7.5 million,
and they want more money early in the contract. Anderson is seeking
more than $13 million the first three years; the Falcons' last
offer was for around $11 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harold told me money can be moved from the fifth year (when
Anderson's salary would be $9 million),'' Sims said. ``And they can
increase the third year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like the four of us (Reeves, Richardson, Anderson and
Sims) to sit down and negotiate. These were Harold's words: `If
Jamal shows commitment, we'll move numbers.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's market value has been more defined by the contract
signed last week by Rams running back Marshall Faulk.
</P>
<P>
   That seven-year deal included a $7 million signing bonus, and
the first four years of the contract are worth about $19.5 million,
similar to what Atlanta offered Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   But Faulk will get a 1999 salary of $2.6 million while the
Falcons offered Anderson considerably less.

CHAFING SOURCE OF ELECTRICAL SHORT ABOARD SHUTTLE, NASA SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The electrical short during last month's launching of the
shuttle Columbia was caused by a wire rubbing on a screw head, NASA
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The repeated chafing over many flights had worn away the wire's
insulation. Technicians should have applied Teflon tape to the wire
before the launch as a protective measure, said James Hartsfield, a
spokesman for NASA's shuttle program.
</P>
<P>
   Managers have ordered new inspections on the shuttle Endeavour
to check for similar wear. Endeavour is scheduled for a Sept. 16
liftoff with a sophisticated radar system to map the Earth's
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Eileen Collins, the first ever woman spacecraft
commander, the shuttle Columbia blasted off late July 22 with the
$1.55 billion Chandra X-ray Observatory. Five seconds after launch,
a short disrupted the primary computers on two of Columbia's three
main engines.
</P>
<P>
   Backup controllers took over, but had they faltered Collins and
her four crewmates would have been forced to attempt an
unprecedented emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle's engine controllers were ruled out as the source of
the short soon after Columbia returned to the Kennedy Space Center
in Florida from its successful five-day flight. Over the weekend,
engineers found a charred segment of an electrical wire leading
from the shuttle's crew compartment to the engine compartment.
</P>
<P>
   The short occurred in the shuttle's mid-body, in an
unpressurized area beneath the payload bay, where further burning
was unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsfield said the chafed wiring was close to a screw head that
was ``roughened.'' The insulation around the original wire had been
rubbed away by repeated contact with the fastener over 26 shuttle
flights and 20 ferry flights during which Columbia had been bolted
atop a Boeing 747 jumbo jet and transported across country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standard procedure, although it is up to the
interpretation of the technician working on it, is that when you
see a screw or a rough place in proximity to any of the wiring on
the orbiter is that you put some protective tape over the wiring,''
said Hartsfield. ``The point is our procedures would keep you from
having this kind of situation.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the electrical short, Columbia also experienced a
small leak of explosive hydrogen during its climb to orbit. The
leak caused the shuttle to reach a slightly lower orbit than
planned. Had it been worse, the leak could have prompted an
emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers believe a loose, 1-inch-long pin inside one of the
rocket engines was hurled through the combustion chamber, striking
three small coolant lines filled with hydrogen in the nozzle.
</P>
<P>
   One of the three reusable rocket engines assigned to Endeavour's
upcoming flight also had an identical pin in its oxygen injection
system. Another engine without a pin has been substituted.

WASHINGTON PROMISES TO HELP KENTUCKY URANIUM WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., S.C., Ohio, Wash.)  (sw) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Energy Department will expand its promise of
finding and compensating workers made sick in its bomb-production
factories to include employees at a giant Kentucky plant that
processed uranium for bombs and military reactors, Energy Secretary
Bill Richardson said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear wastes and plutonium, which are even more dangerous than
uranium, were mixed in with the uranium at the Paducah Gaseous
Diffusion Plant.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the department would look at health of employees
at the plant, where uranium is sorted to separate the type that is
easily split in reactors and bombs. Industrial hygeine at the plant
was poor for decades, department officials say, but they are now
looking into how those problems may have been made more serious by
the presence of plutonium and other materials. Uranium is a toxic
metal but is not highly radioactive.
</P>
<P>
   A contractor, Lockheed Martin Energy Systems, prepared a report
in 1992 that said the plant had used more than 100,000 tons of
recycled uranium that included plutonium and other contaminants
that were far more dangerous than those in the compound based on
virgin uranium that Paducah usually processed. A trade journal,
Nuclear Fuel, carried an article on the report at the time, and
environmentalists have intermittently discussed the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson made his announcement after The Washington Post
reported on Sunday that plant workers may have been made sick by
plutonium, but he said his department had been looking into the
matter since June, because ``we had an inkling of the problem
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts familiar with the situation said the ``inkling''
was a suit brought under the False Claims Act against contractors
who operated the plant for the government. The act allows private
parties to sue if they believe the government has been cheated. The
suit, which was brought by the Natural Resources Defense Council,
an environmental group, is now sealed to give the Justice
Department an opportunity to decide if it wants to join. The suit
reportedly accuses the contractors of improperly disposing of
materials and polluting the surrounding land.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department and other agencies have documented
extensive contamination at the site, in western Kentucky near the
Ohio River.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview on Monday, Richardson said the
department and its predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission, knew
that the recycled material had been used and were aware of a 1992
study by a contractor, Martin Marietta Energy Systems, reviewing
the use of the recycled material.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason it's an issue now,'' Richardson said, ``is that I
have now made a determination that if a worker has an ailment that
is connected with any type of radiation, then the government must
pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said, ``We owe a great debt to the work force at
Paducah, and we are fully investigating these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson announced last month that the department would seek
to compensate weapons plant employees made ill by exposure to
beryllium, a metal used in making nuclear bombs. He said on Monday
that he would try to add to that legislation, which has not yet
been submitted to Congress, to cover those exposed to radioactive
materials at Paducah as well.
</P>
<P>
   Department officials said they were reviewing records of urine
samples taken from Paducah workers over the years, and might also
ask workers and former workers to submit to body scans to test for
radioactive materials.
</P>
<P>
   The recycled uranium, a small amount of which was sent to
similar plants, at Oak Ridge, Tenn., and Portsmouth, Ohio, was
mostly uranium that had run through reactors at the Hanford nuclear
reservation, in Washington state, or Savannah River, near Aiken,
S.C., in the process of making plutonium for bombs. But the
chemical processing plants that sorted out the plutonium did not
recover all of it before it went to Paducah and the other plants;
likewise, some highly radioactive fission products remained in the
uranium.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said that the plutonium would be a hazard but that other
materials, including Technetium-99, might be more of a hazard
because they are far more radioactive.
</P>
<P>
   The 1992 report by Lockheed Martin said that the use of the
recycled material, from 1953 to 1976, would make the Paducah plant
much harder to decontaminate, because workers who did the job would
have to wear respirators and protective clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Michaels, the department's assistant secretary for
environment, safety and health, who met with union officials at
Paducah on Monday afternoon, said in a telephone interview, ``I
will do everything in my power to get to the bottom of these
allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're to determine are there any hazards now facing the
workers or the community, and if we've done anything in the past
that has made people sick, we want to take care of them.''
Thousands of workers were employed by the plants during the decades
that the recycled uranium was processed.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said a preliminary evaluation in June had found no
imminent hazards at the plant, much of which is now privately owned
and operated.

BANKS' RECOVERY IN INDONESIA IS COMPLICATED BY SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WAYNE ARNOLD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ The head of the powerful agency entrusted with
bailing out Indonesia's graft-ridden financial system offered to
resign Monday as allegations of corruption threatened to discredit
his own organization.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a scandal that highlights the paradoxes of a
government's efforts to disinfect itself, the chairman of the
Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency, Glenn M.S. Yusuf, said that
he was ready to step aside temporarily so that his agency could be
cleared of charges that a senior official helped President B.J.
Habibie's political party siphon 550 billion rupiah ($78 million)
in campaign funds from a bank under the agency's control, Bank
Bali.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to conduct a proper investigation, it is better
that related parties, including myself, step aside if needed,''
Yusuf said. The agency said it was investigating the matter and
would publish the results, possibly within a week.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's finance minister said Friday that Indonesia's
Supreme Audit Agency, which answers directly to Indonesia's House
of Representatives, would also look into the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's necessary for IBRA that we clarify the case,'' Finance
Minister Bambang Subianto told reporters at a seminar on investment
in Indonesia, referring to the bank restructuring agency's acronym.
This effort is part of the government trying to avoid the emergence
of other problems which, in turn, could hamper the bank
restructuring process.''
</P>
<P>
   Habibie faces a difficult re-election campaign in November
following his party's second-place finish in June's national
parliamentary elections. The latest scandal buttresses allegations
by opposition politicians that his party, Golkar, is using
government money to help finance Habibie's campaign. Both Golkar
and the rival Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, which won
the most votes in June parliamentary elections, announced that they
would conduct their own investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Jakarta's business leaders also watching the Bank Bali case to
see how the bank restructuring agency weather's the latest assault
on its integrity. The agency was created early last year at the
behest of the International Monetary Fund, which has provided more
than $40 billion in aid to Indonesia to help it recover from the
Asia economic crisis that began two years ago. Since then, IBRA has
closed 66 banks, taken over 12, merged 4 into the nation's largest
single bank and is meanwhile helping raise the more than $35
billion needed to save the country's 9 surviving banks. Its
takeovers have left the agency with a portfolio of assets
equivalent to at least one-fifth of the entire Indonesian economy.
</P>
<P>
   The agency needs to raise 17 trillion rupiah by spring from
asset sales to help the government offset 34 trillion rupiah in
interest payments on bonds it has issued to help recapitalize the
nation's surviving banks. Doing so means wresting control of assets
from the nation's powerful political elite, people with close
connections to Habibie and Suharto.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Bank Bali imbroglio is just the latest obstacle the agency
has faced. In addition to aggravating bureaucratic tangles, Yusuf
has been criticized because he is also heads an investment bank
advising the agency. Foreign investors have accuse the agency of
stalling on asset sales to prevent them from falling into foreign
hands; local property owners accuse the agency of trying to sell
the nation out.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Britain's Standard Chartered PLC agreed to buy a fifth
of family-owned Bank Bali, but the deal fell through in part
because Standard Chartered discovered that the cost of
recapitalizing the bank was roughly double initial estimates. IBRA
was forced to take the bank over last month while a new deal was
worked out for Standard Chartered to double its purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   Then late last month, a prominent Indonesian legal expert
accused the agency's deputy chairman, Pande Lubis, of arranging for
Bank Bali to pay 550 billion rupiah to businessmen to help it
secure the repayment of 904 billion rupiah in delinquent interbank
loans from two banks IBRA had already taken over. Most of the fees
Bank Bali paid allegedly ended up at a local finance company called
Era Giat Prima. The head of that company, Setya Novanto, is also
vice treasurer of Golkar, the political party of former president
Suharto and current president, Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   Pande has issued no statement concerning the charges, and he
could not be reached for comment. Reports Monday said he had been
temporarily suspended from the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Yusuf has said the agency had discovered the payments when it
nationalized Bank Bali July 23, and that part of the 550 billion
rupiah had indeed been paid to Era Giat Prima. In a statement last
week, IBRA said that its payments to Bank Bali were part of its
continuing work to honor obligations between banks and that Bank
Bali's agreement with Era Giat Prima had not been disclosed.

   STATE SECURITIES REGULATORS URGE DAY-TRADING CHANGES
</P>
<P>
   Many day-trading firms use deceptive marketing practices to lure
customers into a stock trading strategy that will probably cause
them to lose money, and then they help to keep them trading by
arranging what could be illegal loans, according to the North
American Securities Administrators Association, a group of state
regulators. In a report, the regulators urged the firms to do a
better job of screening potential customers and to disclose more
fully the risks. The group also asked national regulators to step
up their enforcement of trading rules and to ban some of the
day-trading industry's most common lending practices.

COLORADO KILLERS INSPIRED YOUTH IN GEORGIA SHOOTING, NOTE SAYS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONYERS, Ga. _ A 15-year-old boy charged in the shooting of six
classmates at his high school here on May 20 had left a letter
under his bed expressing admiration for the two teen-agers who
killed 12 students, a teacher and themselves at a Colorado high
school exactly a month earlier, according to testimony in a
juvenile-court hearing Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing is being held in this suburb east of Atlanta to
determine whether the boy, T.J. Solomon, should be tried as an
adult.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon's letter, handwritten on notebook paper, was read aloud
by a Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent. It revealed teen-age
despair, at one point saying that ``even the smallest of scars can
run deep,'' and expressed allegiance to his ``brothers and sisters
related to the trench coat mafia.'' The so-called trench coat mafia
was a group of social outcasts at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., who dressed in black trench coats. The Columbine
killers, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, were fringe members of the
group.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his letter, Solomon wrote that he would be
``laughing at my victims as they drop to their knees. Praying for
their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents said that in addition to the letter they had found
beneath Solomon's bed three pages of bomb-building instructions
printed from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was apparently unable to carry out his threat of
planting bombs in his school, Solomon walked into Heritage High
School with a sawed-off .22-caliber rifle strapped to his leg and a
.357-caliber handgun tucked into his pants, then fired into a
crowded common area just before the homeroom bell rang.
</P>
<P>
   No decision was reached by the juvenile-court judge, William
Schneider, and the hearing is scheduled to continue on Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Classmates of Solomon, some of them friends and some of them
victims, testified at the hearing that Solomon had bragged that he
could do better than the Columbine shooters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it should have happened to our school a long time
ago,'' said Trey Carver, a freshman who said he had frequently
eaten lunch with Solomon.

BARON CASE TRUSTEE CONTINUES PRESSURE ON BEAR STEARNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The trustee for the liquidation of A.R. Baron, a
brokerage firm that defrauded investors of $75 million before it
failed in 1996, is in negotiations with Bear Stearns Securities
Corp. to resolve claims relating to the smaller firm's failure.
</P>
<P>
   A resolution of the matter may require Bear Stearns to pay more
than the $38.5 million it agreed to in a settlement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission last week.
</P>
<P>
   If the trustee's negotiations with the clearing unit of the Bear
Stearns Companies are not successful, the trustee is prepared to
sue the brokerage firm to reach its objective of paying Baron
customers and creditors all of their allowable claims.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bear Stearns agreed to settle SEC charges that it
helped commit a securities fraud in its role of processing trades
for Baron. The SEC charged that Bear Stearns ignored obvious and
repeated evidence of securities fraud at Baron and did what it
could to keep the smaller firm and its fraudulent practices going.
Bear Stearns neither admitted nor denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its settlement, Bear Stearns agreed to pay $38.5
million in fines and restitution to Baron clients wronged by the
firm's misconduct. The restitution fund will receive $30 million
under the settlement and should be set up by early September.
</P>
<P>
   Distributions are to be overseen by the A.R. Baron trustee,
James W. Giddens, a lawyer at Hughes Hubbard &AMP; Reed in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Stearns said its settlement deal was ``a prudent business
decision undertaken to end what has become a distraction for the
company, its shareholders, its employees and its customers.''
</P>
<P>
   But Giddens clearly thinks that the firm's full responsibilities
in the matter have not yet been resolved. ``Serious settlement
discussions have been going on for several weeks,'' he said. ``We
hope to resolve this matter satisfactorily by the time the
restitution fund is created in early September. But in view of the
egregious nature of Bear Stearns' conduct and substantial losses
suffered by A.R. Baron customers, we are fully prepared to litigate
the estate's claims, if necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Bear Stearns declined to comment on settlement
talks the firm is conducting with the Baron trustee.
</P>
<P>
   The trustee has initiated lawsuits against more than 100
principals and insiders of Baron seeking to recover some $80
million. ``Our objective is to pay all A.R. Baron creditors 100
percent of their allowable claims,'' Giddens said. Customers of the
firm asserting that they lost money through Baron's manipulation of
stocks or other illegal activities account for the bulk of the
claims Giddens is seeking to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Included among these customers are roughly 10 arbitration cases
brought against Bear Stearns by Baron investors who lost money when
the firm failed.
</P>
<P>
   A class-action suit is also pending against Bear Stearns for its
role in the Baron failure.

HIGH COURT CANDIDATES LIST NARROWED TO 15

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The list of finalists for two vacancies on the state's
highest court has been narrowed to 15, including an Indonesian-born
probate judge, a former legal aide to former Governor John Volpe,
and an openly gay appeals court judge.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci is set to announce his nominees to
replace justices Charles Fried and Herbert Wilkins before Labor
Day, in what may be the closest-watched appointments of his term so
far.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, who has an opportunity to dramatically reshape the
Supreme Judicial Court during his term, will consider 15 lawyers,
including 11 women and several racial minorities, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor faces some pressure to diversify the seven-member
court, after choosing white men for most of 34 lower court slots.
</P>
<P>
   The finalists include 12 judges and three practicing lawyers.
Five appeals court judges are under consideration. They include:
</P>
<P>
   -- Barbara Lenk, a Harvard Law School graduate and openly gay
former partner at Brown, Rudnick, Freed &AMP; Gesmer. Lenk did first
amendment work at the firm. In 1993, she became a Superior Court
judge for three years. She served as chair of the board of editors
for the Boston Bar Journal. She also has a PhD from Yale in
political philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   -- Francis Spina, who has been an appeals court judge since
1997, and served on the Superior Court for four years. The graduate
of Boston College Law School is from Pittsfield, and launched his
career with the Western Massachusetts Legal Services. An
Italian-American, he also served as an assistant district attorney
in Berkshire County and spent about a decade in private practice.
He is also the former president of the Berkshire Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   -- Christopher Armstrong, who became an associate justice in
1972. He graduated from Yale University and Yale Law School. He is
no stranger to politics, having served as assistant legal council
to former governor's John Volpe and was chief counsel to former
Gov. Sargent.
</P>
<P>
   -- Charlotte Anne Perretta, a Suffolk Law School alum, who
became an associate Appeals Court Justice in 1978. An appointee of
former Governor Michael S. Dukakis, she began her career working
with Crane, Inker &AMP; Oteri.
</P>
<P>
   -- Elizabeth A. Porada, a Northampton native who also served as
a district and Superior court judge. Porada, a graduate of
Radcliffe and Boston University Law School, also practiced law in
Northampton for 18 yeras.
</P>
<P>
   Several Superior Court judges have also made the cut, including:
</P>
<P>
   -- Judith Cowin, a 1970 Harvard Law School graduate, who went to
Wellesley College as an undergraduate. She was a prosecutor in the
Norfolk County DA's office from 1979 to 1991, when she ascended to
the bench.
</P>
<P>
   -- Margot Botsford, who was appointed to the Superior Court in
1989 by Dukakis. The New York native graduated cum laude from
Barnard College and Northeastern University School of Law, and
worked at Hill &AMP; Barlow and the attorney general's office. She is
considered a long-shot because of her ties to Dukakis. She is
married to Stephen Rosenfeld, who was Dukakis' legal counsel.
</P>
<P>
   -- Martha Sosman, who co-founded an all-female law firm with a
group of women from a US attorney's office in Boston. She graduated
from the University of Michigan Law School in 1979 and went to
Foley, Hoag. Sosman, a gifted pianist, was also an assistant U.S.
attorney under William F. Weld.
</P>
<P>
   -- Daniel Toomey, who Weld appointed to the Superior Court in
1992. He was born in Cambridge, went to Boston University Law
School and Boston College. Toomey has been a district court judge,

district attorney and was the chief appeals attorney for the
Massachusetts Defenders Committee.
</P>
<P>
   -- Allan van Gestel, who was a parnter at Goodwin, Procter &AMP;
Hoar for 26 years, where he did very complex civil litigation
cases. Van Gestel lacks the long track record of the other judges,
having joined the court in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates from the bench include:
</P>
<P>
   --Timothy Gailey, a district court judge in Lynn. Gailey is a

</P>
<P>
   -- Middlesex Probate court judge Fernande R.V. Duffly, born in
Indonesia, was at Warner &AMP; Stackpole from 1978 to 1992, including
six years as a partner.
</P>
<P>
   There are also three women who are not currently serving as
judges:
</P>
<P>
   -- Margaret Burnham, an African-American, who is a partner at
Burnham &AMP; Hines, which specializes in civil and criminal
litigation. She began her career with the NAACP Defense Fund in New

assistant attorney general for policy development at the US
Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cynthia Cohen is a personal injury lawyer at Meehan, Boyle &AMP;
Cohen of Boston, which has held the record for a personal injury
settlement. She is in line to become the next president of the
Massachusetts Bar Association and is also very active in Democratic
political circles. She lives in Cambridge, graduated from Brown

EMC TO PICK UP DATA GENERAL IN $1.1 BILLION STOCK SWAP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: New England)  (EDS: Spellings of `Clariion' in 4th graf and `Aviion' in 5th graf
are correct.) 
(yn) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Offering the latest evidence of the Internet's enormous impact
on all facets of the computer industry, EMC Corp., a leading
producer of data storage equipment, said Monday that it had agreed
to acquire Data General Corp., in a stock swap valued at about $1.1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies make storage devices _ ranging from high-capacity
disk drives to vast arrays of disks and tape units _ that are
crucial to the operation of networks and to the distribution of
data over them. EMC's products are designed for the largest
mainframe computers, while Data General's are aimed at smaller,
mid-range computers that typically run the Unix or Windows NT
operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   The explosive growth of the Internet has significantly increased
demand for both categories _ but especially for mid-range computers
_ for use as servers, the powerful machines that provide products
like World Wide Web sites and e-mail for millions of users.
</P>
<P>
   Data General, the once-scrappy minicomputer maker profiled in
Tracy Kidder's best-selling book, ``The Soul of a New Machine,''
has in recent years derived an ever larger portion of its revenues
from its Clariion line of storage products for mid-range computers.
</P>
<P>
   After the acquisition, EMC said, Data General's computer systems
business, Aviion, will operate as a separate unit.
</P>
<P>
   The deal values Data General's shares at $19.58, 48 percent
higher than they closed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   EMC shares closed at $57, down $3, and Data General shares
closed at $17.4375, up $4.25, both on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the acquisition fit EMC's strategy of broadening
its product offerings away from the mainframe market to embrace a
broader range of customers, primarily those that run network
servers and other mid-sized computer systems. Although Data
General's financial results have suffered in the last two years
from tactical miscues and management issues, analysts said the
company's products remained strong and would benefit from EMC's
more robust sales structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Data General has been going through a major program during the
past year to beef up their direct sales activities,'' said Jim
Porter, an analyst with Disk Trend, in Mountain View, Calif.,
noting that the company had previously sold most of its storage
products to computer systems manufacturers rather than to users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Direct sales is an EMC specialty, so this is going to make a
fundamental change in how Data General does business,'' Porter
said.
</P>
<P>
   The merger brings together two of Massachusetts' largest
technology companies, with EMC based in Hopkington and Data General
in Westboro. Along with Digital Equipment Corp. and Prime Computer,
Data General launched the minicomputer revolution and helped spark
the ``Massachusetts Miracle'' of the 1980s. Slow to catch the shift
from minicomputers to servers, Data General lagged behind companies
like IBM, Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard Co. in the 1990s but
built a strong franchise in data storage.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition allows EMC to broaden its market much more
rapidly than it could by developing its own line of mid-sized
storage devices, Michael C. Ruettgers, EMC's president and chief
executive, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been selling Clariion for some time now, so it is a
fairly well-known product in the marketplace,'' he said. ``The
reason it hasn't been more successful is it never had all the
software to make it more useful. We have that software. And, more
importantly, we have the largest direct-selling storage sales force
in the world and the best storage service organization in the

   Ruettgers said the pooling-of-interests structure of the
acquisition made it impossible to spin off the server business for
the next two years. But he added that EMC was interested in
applying Aviion's NUMA technology, a method for having multiple
processors use a common supply of memory, in its storage management
products.
</P>

   ``The only other company that had that technology was Sequent,
which was just acquired by IBM,'' he said.

   Porter of Disk Trend said that Data General had been a pioneer
in moving its product line from storage devices that send and
receive computer data over the small computer systems interface, or
SCSI (pronounced SKUZ-ee) channel, to a faster technology called
fiber channel. But the company may have moved faster than its
market, causing its storage sales to flatten in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They moved away from SCSI a little ahead of the pack, and this
bold gamble did not pay off because they got there too early,''
Porter said. ``But now, fiber channel is becoming a major part of
the high-end market.''

PROBLEMS AT MCI WORLDCOM HIT ITS DATA NETWORK USERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mo., Ill.)   (af)  
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hundreds of corporate users of one of MCI Worldcom Inc.'s big
data networks were suffering problems ranging from slowdowns to
outright failures Monday. The problems began Thursday night, the
company said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom is the nation's No. 2 long-distance communications
carrier, after AT&AMP;T Corp. Last April, AT&AMP;T suffered a similar
problem, one that diluted the quarterly financial results for the
company's unit that serves business customers. As did AT&AMP;T, MCI
Worldcom is having a problem with one of its frame relay networks.
</P>
<P>
   Frame relay is a data networking technology used by many
companies to connect offices in different cities. In addition to
proprietary data, Internet information and sometimes telephone
calls can be transported using frame relay technology.
</P>
<P>
   Of the several thousand customers of the MCI frame relay
network, about 30 percent had been affecte by the problems, which
were concentrated on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   An MCI spokesman said the data communications unit, which
includes the frame relay operation, generated $1.8 billion in
revenue last quarter. The company's total revenue was $8.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Data Research Associates Inc., a company based in
St. Louis that develops software for library networks, said Monday
afternoon that they were suffering serious problems with their
frame relay service provided by MCI Worldcom.
</P>
<P>
   Bridge News reported Monday that the Chicago Board of Trade's
electronic trading system had not worked properly since Thursday
because of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The problems began Thursday as the company upgraded software for
frame relay switches made by Lucent Technologies Inc. Spokesmen for
both companies, however, said that the underlying cause had not yet
been determined and that MCI Worldcom had conducted similar
upgrades in recent weeks without incident.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom said the network glitches were not related to the
so-called Year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's frame relay failures were caused by improper software for
switches made by Cisco Systems Inc., one of Lucent's main
competitors. AT&AMP;T cited the failure for a decline in earnings
before interest and taxes in the company's business-services unit
in the second quarter of 1998.

AFTER LEAVING ICM, JAMES WIATT BECOMES PRESIDENT OF WILLIAM
MORRIS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Only three days after resigning as co-chairman of
International Creative Management, a top talent agency, James A.
Wiatt was named president of the rival William Morris agency
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt took along such high-priced clients as Eddie Murphy and
Sylvester Stallone as well as directors including Nora Ephron,
Penny Marshall, Richard Donner and Reny Harlin and Kevin
Williamson, the writer-producer.
</P>
<P>
   Though somewhat expected, the speed of the change startled other
talent agents in Hollywood. The swiftness is underscored by the
fact that by Tuesday, Wiatt will start working for the longtime
rival to ICM. On Tuesday night, Wiatt plans to attend the premiere
of ``Bowfinger,'' a comedy starring Murphy, accompanied by some
William Morris agents.
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt quit ICM on Friday after numerous disagreements with Jeff
Berg, the co-chairman and longtime head of the talent agency. At
William Morris, Wiatt will replace Arnold Rifkin, who represented
Bruce Willis, Whoopi Goldberg and several other stars.
</P>
<P>
   Rifkin said he did not want to extend his current contract,
which had a year left. But several agents at William Morris said
that the agency's board was somewhat unhappy that more high-priced
clients had not been signed in recent years, and Wiatt's
availability led them to make the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to inject this agency with a different vitamin,''
said one top agent at William Morris. Several William Morris agents
said they had mixed emotions about the departure of Rifkin, a
sometimes difficult but also dynamic figure.
</P>
<P>
   The Morris agency described Rifkin's departure after seven years
as ``friendly and amicable'' and said that he would remain in his
office until Labor Day to work with Wiatt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to make this a clean, classy exit,'' said Rifkin,
who was expected to depart with a hefty severance package.
``There's no acrimony. I'm going to help Jimmy make the
transition.''
</P>
<P>
   Rifkin said he was unsure about his future. ``I've been an agent
for 25 years,'' he said. ``I can't say I know anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Willis, Rifkin's most important client, said, ``I continue
to support my friend and partner of 15 years in whatever choice he
makes in business and his life.'' The movie star said that he
remained Rifkin's ``biggest fan.''
</P>
<P>
   The fallout of the agency change is expected to ripple across
Hollywood. Wiatt's former agency, ICM, was the most hurt by the
departures. Though top executives there said that Murphy and other
stars were booked in films for several years and that the agency
would continue to collect its fees, Wiatt's exit may lead to
further departures by agents, and their clients, to William Morris.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, William Morris may face the exit of several agents
because of Wiatt's appointment.
</P>
<P>
   But Wiatt, who met several William Morris agents separately at
his home Monday morning, said: ``I'd be surprised if anybody left.
Why would they leave? I'm pretty good at making people feel good,
and I want to provide an environment where people wouldn't want to
leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt said he had never been to the William Morris agency
headquarters in Beverly Hills, less than two miles from the offices
of ICM.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I'll ever walk into the William Morris agency
will be tomorrow morning,'' he said.

TEXAS ASKS COURT TO ALLOW UNCENSORED SCHOOL PRAYER AT EVENTS 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas has joined eight other states in asking
the U.S. Supreme Court to allow uncensored prayer at public school
commencements and sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief filed Monday, the states maintained that a 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that allows student-initiated,
non-sectarian, non-proselytizing prayer at commencements but not at
sporting events conflicts with a recent 11th Circuit Court of
appeals ruling that student-initiated prayer is protected by
constitutional free-speech protections.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Fe Independent School District in Galveston County has
appealed the 5th Circuit ruling to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The states asked that the Supreme Court consider the Santa Fe
case so the law will be the same all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush added his name to the brief filed by
Attorney General John Cornyn.
</P>
<P>
   Other states joining in the filing of the brief by Texas
officials are Alabama, Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Nebraska, South Carolina and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The law allows students to gather for voluntary prayer at school
but prohibits school districts and officials from initiating and
sponsoring prayer.

VICTOR MATURE, 86, `BEEFCAKE' FILM STAR OF '40S AND '50S 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: A longer version of this obit, OBIT-MATURE-NYT, will be
filed.) 
(mk) 
 By ALJEAN HARMETZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Victor Mature, who attained movie stardom dressed in a wooly
mammoth loincloth, died on Wednesday in San Diego County, Calif. He
was 86.
</P>
<P>
   He died of cancer, said Zollie Volchok, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Bare-chested and bare-armed, Mature in his long career in
Hollywood sported a variety of loincloths, togas and leotards _ as
the prehistoric hunter, Tumak, in the movie that made him a star in
1940, ``One Million B.C.''; as the Greek slave, Demetrius, who
became a fervent Christian in ``The Robe'' (1953) and who later
demonstrated muscular Christianity in ``Demetrius and the
Gladiators'' (1954); as the dashing lion killer in ``The Egyptian''
(1954); and as the long- haired Samson who succumbed to the wiles
of Hedy Lamarr in Cecil B. DeMille's ``Samson and Delilah'' (1949).
</P>
<P>
   The word ``Beefcake'' may have been coined to define Mature's
broad shoulders, narrow waist, curly hair and sensual face crowned
by dazzling white teeth. In his first Broadway role, he played the
gorgeous movie star who wooed Gertrude Lawrence in the hit Broadway
musical ``Lady in the Dark'' (1941). His costumes included pink
circus tights topped by leopard skin briefs and he managed not to
be an anticlimax even after being described as ``the most beautiful
hunk of man you ever saw in your life'' before his arrival on
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Never an actor who took himself too seriously, Mature was fond
of telling the story of how he was rejected for membership in the
Los Angeles Country Club because the club did not accept actors. He
told a reporter that he had replied, ``Hell, I'm no actor, and I've
got 28 pictures and a scrapbook of reviews to prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, some of his reviews were good. Under the direction of
John Ford, he held his own against Henry Fonda's Wyatt Earp,
playing the dying Doc Holliday, the Eastern doctor turned
tubercular Western gambler in ``My Darling Clementine'' (1946). In
the movie he handled Hamlet's ``To Be or Not To Be'' soliloquy
without embarrassing himself or the audience.
</P>
<P>
   And in the film noir ``Kiss of Death'' (1947) he was widely
praised for his work as Nick Bianco, a small- time crook who wants
to go straight but who is menaced by Richard Widmark's giggling
psychopathic killer Tommy Udo. It was perhaps his best performance.
``Victor Mature gives an unexpectedly subdued, convincing
performance,'' Pauline Kael wrote. Time magazine said the actor
``apparently needed nothing all this time but the right kind of
role.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor Mature was set on his career path as a heartthrob in his
first film, ``The Housekeeper's Daughter'' (1939). He flashed on
the screen for less than five minutes playing the bit part of a
lovesick gangster; his appearance brought 20,000 fan letters and
won him the lead in ``One Million B.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Mature told Life magazine in 1941, ``I can act, but what I've
got that the others don't have is this,'' as he pointed to his
body. The same article described him as ``proportioned like a
frappe glass'' with a 33-inch waist, 25- inch biceps and a 45-inch
chest, and standing 6 feet 2 1/2 inches tall. Life added that 300
New York models had chosen him as the man they would most like to
be marooned with on a desert island.
</P>
<P>
   Mature, who was fond of ice cream and loathed exercise,
described himself to the Saturday Evening Post in 1942 as ``the
biggest fraud that ever hit Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   But he took full advantage of the physique that nature had
offered him. He made 55 movies, married five times, earned $18
million, invested wisely, and more or less retired at the age of 46
to play golf and eat. ``There's a lot to be said for loafing if you
know how to do it gracefully,'' he said in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   From 1940 to 1950, despite losing three years when he was in the
Coast Guard during World War II, Mature starred in 17 movies,
including, in 1942, ``Footlight Serenade'' and ``Song of the
Islands'' with Betty Grable, ``My Gal Sal'' with Rita Hayworth, and
``Seven Days Leave'' with Lucille Ball. From 1950 to 1960 he
churned out 30 films.
</P>
<P>
   Then, having prospered in commercial real estate and having been
prescient enough to open stores selling television sets the year
after television began, he departed to a manor house overlooking
the ninth hole at the Rancho Santa Fe Country Club, a two-hour
drive south of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Mature was born on Jan. 29, 1916, in Louisville, Ky., the
son of an Austrian scissors grinder who had married the local
doctor's daughter. Victor was one of the three children born to
Marcellus and Clara Mature.
</P>
<P>
   Unstudious and rebellious, he was thrown out of four schools,
including the Kentucky Military Institute. A classmate there, the
comedian Jim Backus, recalled the illegal cocktail parties of lemon
soda and Aqua Velva shaving lotion that they co-hosted, and said
Mature was known as ``Cadet Slob.'' Leaving school at 15, he became
a salesman with a wholesale candy house, then went out on his own
as a candy jobber.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later he packed his car with canned goods and candy
and headed to Hollywood, armed with the following advice from his
father, who had become a success in the refrigeration business:
``As long as people think you're dumber than you are, you'll make
money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Arrived here with eleven cents and an ambition. I am going to
become an actor,'' Mature said he telegraphed his father. His
father wired back: ``Forty-three years ago I arrived in New York
with five cents and could not even speak English. You are six cents
up on me.''

TERROR IN THE BLOOD: HORROR FILMMAKER'S DAUGHTER IS UP TO
HER  FATHER'S OLD TRICKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER STACK  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIBURON, Calif. _ Terry Castle may be the only movie producer in
America who can get away with splattering fake blood on
kindergartners. The daughter of legendary B-grade horror filmmaker
William Castle says it's in her genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the blood to the classroom for fun but also to show
kids that in the movies it's just Karo syrup and not really all
that scary,'' said Castle, 41. ``What was scary was accidentally
splattering the stuff on the teacher's dress.''
</P>
<P>
   Castle, who lives in Marin County, north of San Francisco, and
is former executive in charge of production for Nickelodeon's ``Are
You Afraid of the Dark?,'' keeps an exhausting schedule these days,
carpooling kids in a Volvo station wagon while also producing
films.
</P>
<P>
   She's on a mission to return her father's name to the limelight.
William Castle, one of Hollywood's most audacious showmen in the
'50s and '60s (he also produced ``Rosemary's Baby''), died in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Castle is co-producer of a forthcoming Warner Bros. remake
of her father's 1958 cult classic ``House on Haunted Hill,'' which
starred Vincent Price. On the production team are high-profile
moviemakers Joel Silver, Robert Zemeckis (``Forrest Gump'') and Gil
Adler. Geoffrey Rush stars with Famke Janssen (``GoldenEye'') in
the movie, due out this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Castle said the production team, under the banner of Dark Castle
Productions, may also retool other Castle classics such as ``The
Tingler,'' ``Macabre'' and ``Homicidal.'' Zemeckis is a longtime
fan of Castle's films.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond her deals with Warner Bros., Castle has reopened her
father's old production company. It gives her dibs on an array of
scripts and promotional gimmicks that were never used.
</P>
<P>
   ``William Castle Productions is up and running again,'' she said
in her small Marin office, surrounded by photographs and
memorabilia of Castle's glory days as producer, director and one of
Hollywood's marketing geniuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a remarkable creative force,'' she said. ``Ideas would
spill out of him. He'd make a film in seven days. The original
`House on Haunted Hill' had a budget of $150,000. In a few months
it made $2 million.''
</P>
<P>
   With that film, Castle introduced one of his most noted
gimmicks, a creation called Emergo. At a certain point in the
movie, a skeleton flew above the audience and in front of the
screen, carried on a rope attached to pulleys.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Castle said, audiences were ``scared witless.''
``Later, when everybody knew it was fake, they'd just throw popcorn
at the bones,'' she said. ``But they always had fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Castle said the revived William Castle Productions is developing
a psychological thriller, ``Point Dume,'' about a young woman who
learns that she is to become a murder victim. The picture, named
after a rocky outcropping north of Malibu, is being written by D.J.
MacHale, creator of ``Are You Afraid of the Dark?''
</P>
<P>
   Castle also plans films for teens and preteens, and last week
she announced development of a kids' thriller set in a medieval
castle, titled ``Rubbish.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father started his theatrical career at age 15, working with
Bela Lugosi on a stage version of ``Dracula.'' As a young man he
took over Orson Welles' Stony Creek Theatre company in Connecticut.
Impressed by his gifts as a showman, hotshot producer Harry Cohn
beckoned him to Hollywood. There, Castle blazed a trail of amusing
schlock films and concocted outlandish stunts to lure audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was afraid people wouldn't go to see his films,''
his daughter said. ``He was driven. He wanted audiences to have
fun, and he'd do anything to make sure they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Castle gimmick was a buzzing device called Percepto,
which was wired into theater seats for ``The Tingler.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad probably buzzed 20 million butts with that film,''
Castle said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1959 film, which also starred Price, was about a lobsterlike
organism that lived on people's spines and came to life when they
were frightened. During the movie, the screen would go black and a
voice (Castle's) would announce: ``Attention! The Tingler is loose
in the theater'' and advise people to scream for their lives. As a
few people got their bottoms buzzed, the audience would go nuts.
</P>
<P>
   That particular gimmick became ``the fondest moviegoing memory
of my youth,'' said director John Waters, who has often called
Castle a genius and once revealed that as a child he wished he
could have visited the filmmaker instead of Santa Claus.
</P>
<P>
   Retrospectives at art-film houses like New York City's Film
Forum, the Nuart in Los Angeles and the UC Theatre in Berkeley,
Calif., have celebrated Castle's odd, trashy sense of humor _ he
offered insurance policies against ``death by fright'' for
``Macabre'' (1958) and established ``fright breaks'' and a
``coward's corner'' in theaters for ``Homicidal,'' a 1961
``Psycho'' takeoff. With that film, he also offered money-back
guarantees to people if they got too scared.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Castle is married to Tom Newell, a former CBS lawyer and
now senior vice president of the Internet digital sports startup
Quokka.com. They have two children, Kyle, 6, and William, 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had such a great family experience as a kid,'' Castle said.
``Dad was always a great storyteller and one of those doting dad
types. If I had a temperature of 99, he'd drop everything and be
home pacing at the foot of my bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom, Ellen, hated all the Hollywood stuff, and she kept him
grounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Castle, a former actress who worked for the Resistance in
World War II Holland, now lives in Marin County. Terry Castle's
older sister, Georgiana, died five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As a kid, Castle entertained notions of becoming an actress. ``I
wanted the part that Diane Baker played in `Strait-Jacket,''' she
said. The 1964 thriller, directed by her father, starred Joan
Crawford as an enraged wife who murders her unfaithful husband and
his mistress with an ax. Her young daughter (played by Baker)
witnesses the killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father coached me and told me to look scared, so I
practiced and practiced for weeks,'' said Terry Castle. But on the
first day of shooting, her mother wouldn't let her do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably a good thing because I can't act. But when the
film opened and we went to see it, I sat on my dad's lap watching
Diane Baker and I told him, `I could have done it better.'''

POLICE COMMISSIONER WEIGHS CHANGE IN HOW MISCONDUCT IS
INVESTIGATED
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Police Commissioner Howard Safir is considering a
plan to change the way the Police Department disciplines officers
to give the Civilian Complaint Review Board a greater role in
investigating police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said that while no final decision had been made on the
plan, which would reduce the department's role in the
investigations, ``I would hope that it would happen in the
relatively near future.''
</P>
<P>
   The discussion of the changes in the department's disciplinary
process comes as the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern
District of New York is weighing a possible lawsuit against New
York City, in part because of their finding that the Police
Department has often failed to aggressively punish officers
implicated in brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said there is no connection between his consideration of
changes and any federal actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are discussing now is a position I have had way before
the Eastern District investigation ever began,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the police have generally taken a dim view of the
investigative prowess of the review board. Even when the board
finds misconduct by an officer, the department usually
re-investigates the case before deciding whether to file formal
disciplinary charges.
</P>
<P>
   But now police officials said they believe the review board,
fortified by additional funding and the hiring of more seasoned
investigators, has improved so much that it may be possible to rely
almost exclusively on the board's investigative work.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner outlined the possible changes on July 28 in a
meeting with members of the review board. Under the plan that was
discussed, police officials would still review misconduct cases for
lapses in evidence but would have the CCRB investigators close any
holes, instead of police staff.
</P>
<P>
   The changes under consideration would address what critics
contend is an important defect in the disciplinary process: that an
extra layer of investigation by the police has not only undermined
the independence of the civilian review panel _ which has the power
to look into complaints but no power to discipline officers _ but
also failed to reliably produce stronger cases that resulted in
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the misconduct cases referred to the Police
Department each year by the civilian panel never result in any
disciplinary action against the officers involved. Often, the
police review determines that the evidence collected by the
civilian panel is insufficient to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   For cases in which the department ultimately files charges, most
officers face an administrative trial within the department. If
found guilty, a recommendation for punishment is forwarded to the
police commissioner, who can accept it or reject it.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials say that, without their efforts to review and
bolster the cases they receive, even fewer officers would be
disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a role that the department assumed to protect
investigations that we believed were inadequate,'' Safir said
Monday. ``But we assumed that role inappropriately in my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner said that the plan being discussed ``would make
the CCRB totally independent as far as the investigations are
concerned. One of the issues has always been the police
investigating themselves. Well, we would not be investigating
ourselves, even though I think that we do a very good job of
investigating ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene R. Lopez, the executive director of the review board,
declined comment on what he described as a private discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Although some 100 municipalities in the country have civilian
panels that review allegations of police misconduct, it is rare to
find a city where the findings of the civilian panel are
re-investigated by the police, according to Samuel Walker, a
professor at the University of Nebraska at Omaha who has studied
the civilian review process.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to reinvestigate, why bother having a
civilian panel in the first place?'' Walker said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last year, police officials ruled on 374 cases in which the
Civilian Complaint Review Board had recommended disciplinary action
against officers. In 47 percent of those cases, the officers
received some form of punishment, from a reprimand to being fired.
But dozens of other cases were dismissed by police officials for a
variety of reasons, including their finding that the evidence was
insufficient to support charges or because the statute of
limitations had expired.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have said the failure to charge so many officers against
whom civilian complaints have been upheld is evidence of the Police
Department's reluctance to punish its own. But Safir has noted that
the number of officers disciplined as a result of citizen
complaints has more than doubled since 1996.

unknown directors with three unknown actors would earn $80 million,
be No.2 at the box office and land on this week's covers of Time

abortion in April. When Mrs. Dole ventured into presidential
campaign territory, she was not greeted like another mere candidate

to capitalize on the enthusiasm. And now the kleig lights have

Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, collapse. Instead of being a star,
she has faded into the chorus with the other rivals to Bush.

how to commemorate the past and a battle of esthetic sensibilities.

woolly adelgid, a bug no bigger than the period at the end of a

08-09 -- A sample of calcite crystals found inside Yucca Mountain,
about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas, which is being considered
as a repository for nuclear waste. Some scientists say the crystals
are evidence of intermittent upwellings of underground water, which
would speed the spread of radioactive materials stored in the
mounthain. The Department of Energy is seeking to demonstrate that
these crystals were formed in the same volcanic process that made
the mountain, and that the water table is stable at a level
hundreds of feet below where the nuclear waste would go. (Jon

WASHINGTON FAMILY ACCUSES TEXAS LAWYER OF BARRATRY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Seattle, Wash.) 
 
By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ One of Texas' wealthiest and politically powerful
lawyers has been accused of ambulance chasing by the parents of a
commercial diver, who say Walter Umphrey solicited them as legal
clients while they were at a Port Arthur funeral home to arrange
for their son's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Karen and Peter Pilkington of the Seattle suburb of Bellevue say
they were introduced to Umphrey on March 6, 1996, at the
Clayton-Thompson funeral home in Groves, outside of Port Arthur,
which is about 80 miles east of downtown Houston. Their son, Brian
Pilkington, a 23-year-old working for a Houston dive contractor,
died March 4, 1996, while conducting an underwater inspection of an
offshore drilling rig.
</P>
<P>
   According to corporate records kept by the Texas Secretary of
State, Umphrey is listed as vice president and treasurer of the
funeral home where the solicitation took place.
</P>
<P>
   The Pilkingtons' complaint alleges that a person he believes was
Charles Hansen, director of the funeral home, told them Umphrey was
a childhood friend who ``was now `one of the most famous and best
lawyers in Texas.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hansen offered to arrange for a meeting quickly with Umphrey,
and the lawyer, wearing work boots and overalls, was waiting to
meet them at the funeral home an hour later after the family
returned from lunch, the complaint states.
</P>
<P>
   Umphrey, one of a group of Texas lawyers sharing a $3.3 billion
payment for negotiating a settlement in the state's tobacco
lawsuit, did not return calls Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a heavy political contributor, having donated $1.1
million to mostly Democratic candidates during the 1996 and 1998
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen, reached at the funeral home, said he did not remember
the Pilkington family or Umphrey coming to the funeral home to meet
them. ``I couldn't remember a thing about that,'' said Hansen, who
declined to discuss the matter further and hung up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about the circumstances, as we then knew them,
surrounding our son's death, and Mr. Umphrey said that he would be
able to help us get compensation for his death,'' according to the
complaint the Pilkington family sent to the Texas State Bar, the
state agency that polices lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He added that he shouldn't really meet us in those
circumstances but that he had a proper office in Beaumont and that
if we were interested in retaining him we should go there to tie up
an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt distressed that we were having a business meeting and
discussing financial matters whilst our son was laying in the next
room. It seemed unnatural. Nevertheless, we agreed to enlist the
Respondent's assistance and to travel to his office,'' the
complaint states.
</P>
<P>
   A legal contract was signed in Umphrey's office by the diver's
widow, Julie Pilkington. Karen and Peter Pilkington were later
added as plaintiffs to the lawsuit brought by David Brandom, a
partner in Umphrey's firm who handled the case.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, brought against Houston oil drilling firm Cliffs
Drilling Co., the dive contractor who employed Brian Pilkington,
and two other defendants, was settled for a reported $2.25 million
in 1998, of which the Beaumont law firm received nearly $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Pilkington, contacted in Seattle, said he has presented
the Umphrey law firm with a bill for $300,000 to repay him for the
time and money he spent convincing the U.S. Coast Guard to re-open
its investigation into his son's death and reveal the facts,
something he instructed the Texas firm to do. Pilkington said
Umphrey and his associates were only interested in money.
</P>
<P>
   ``My primary concern was to learn the truth, not go after the
people with the deepest pockets,'' Pilkington said. ``We weren't
after the money. We wanted to find out what the hell happened, and
to make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambulance chasing is the common term for barratry, which under
Texas law is a third degree felony if an attorney or his agents
directly contact accident victims or their survivors to solicit
employment, either in person or by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Barratry is also a violation of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of
Professional Conduct for lawyers, and subjects an attorney to
sanctions ranging from a private reprimand to loss of his law
license.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Miller, acting general counsel for the State Bar of Texas,
said agency rules prevented her from disclosing whether a complaint
had been lodged by the Pilkingtons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our grievance system is confidential up to a certain point in
the process ... I can't confirm or not if we have received one or
it's pending,'' Miller said.

ENDING A SENSELESS WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wars, once started, are often difficult to end. Eritrea's
acceptance of a plan to end its 15-month conflict with Ethiopia
offers hope that both nations will see the folly of continuing to
fight over border lands that have little value either economically
or symbolically.
</P>
<P>
   The war seems to have developed a momentum of its own, with each
nation wasting resources on arms purchases, accusing the other of
human rights violations, and arming factions in nearby Somalia. If
the fighting continues, the entire Horn of Africa could be
destabilized.
</P>
<P>
   That outcome would be particularly tragic because, unlike other
African nations, both Eritrea and Ethiopia have stable governments
led by two exceptional leaders, Isaias Afwerki in Eritrea and Meles
Zenawi in Ethiopia. They should have been able to resolve their
disagreements without war.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea, with 3 1/2 million people, retains an unfortunate sense
of superiority because of its David vs. Goliath victory over
Ethiopia in its war of independence, which ended eight years ago.
Ethiopia's Zenawi, who came to power amid the detritus of defeat,
represents a small ethnic group in a heterogeneous nation of 55
million people. The latest war may have been a force for national
unity.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea's machinations in Somalia are intended to encourage
separatism on Ethiopia's southern flank. The cost of Ethiopian
mobilization imperils economic programs that demonstrate the
advantages of a large nation. Conflict can go only so far to hold a
country together.
</P>
<P>
   As for Eritrea, the urgent task is to coexist with Ethiopia,
whose population is the prime market for Eritrean goods and
services. War is no way to keep old customers or win new ones.
</P>
<P>
   An Ethiopian spokesman said his government is seeking
clarifications from the Organization of African Unity on details of
the latest peace plan. The OAU and diplomats from the United States
have shown persistence and skill in attempting to broker a peace
agreement, but only the Eritrean and Ethiopian governments can
definitively act to end this meaningless war.

COMMERCE DEPT. DISMISSES CLAIM OF UNFAIR PRACTICES AGAINST OIL
PRODUCERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan., Okla., Texas, Alaska, Hawaii, Calif.)  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The Department of Commerce in Washington dismissed
accusations of unfair trade practices against Mexico and three
other crude oil-exporting countries Monday, heading off a potential
economic and political crisis for Mexico and the United States, its
biggest trading partner.
</P>
<P>
   The charges had come from 12 independent oil producers in
Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, asserting that Mexico, Venezuela and
Saudi Arabia, as well as Iraq _which the United Nations has
recently permitted to increase oil exports _ had been selling crude
oil in the United States at prices below production costs, a
violation of American anti-dumping laws.
</P>
<P>
   All four countries denied the dumping charge, but Mexico, which
ships 75 percent of its oil exports to the United States, was the
most outspoken. Shortly after the complaint was filed in late June,
Mexico retaliated by suspending plans to eliminate a tariff on
natural gas imported from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The independent oil companies, which had banded together as a
group calling themselves Save Domestic Oil, had asked the Clinton
administration to impose duties on Mexico and the other countries
that would have forced them out of the U.S. market. Save Domestic
Oil said it planned an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Tellez, Mexico's secretary of energy, said in an interview
that he was ``very happy'' with the Commerce Department's decision.
``It was a very wise and just decision,'' he said. ``We are not
dumping oil on any international market.''
</P>
<P>
   Tellez said he expected that Mexico would put an end to its
tariff on imports of natural gas from the United States in ``a
matter of days.''
</P>
<P>
   George Baker, an energy consultant in Houston, said the Commerce
decision averted ``a deterioration in U.S.-Mexico relations and
some major economic shocks in both countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gasoline prices would have probably gone up in the U.S.,'' he
said. ``A big chunk of Mexican government revenue comes from
petroleum sales to the U.S. They would have had to scramble to find
other customers and would have had to cut back production as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Commerce officials said they had decided not to
pursue the dumping charges after surveying more than 800 American
oil producers, large and small, and finding that more than half the
companies felt that no dumping was taking place. By law, at least
half the industry must support a claim of dumping before the
Commerce Department can start a formal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The independent producers had told Commerce officials that small
oil companies in the United States had lost $15 billion in expected
revenues between late 1997 and June, when the complaint was filed.
Oil prices dropped to as low as $10 a barrel in late 1998, but a
barrel has gone back up to $15, the low end of the range where it
has mostly traded since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The independent producers blamed the slump on pricing by Mexico
and the other three countries. The countries provided about half of
the 8 million barrels of oil that were imported in 1998 into the
states other than Alaska, Hawaii, California and four other Western
states. Those seven use little oil from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the dumping charges, including the American
Petroleum Institute, a Washington trade group that represents most
major American oil companies as well as some independents, said the
drop in oil prices had come not from dumping but from market
pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a worldwide phenomenon brought about by some fairly
significant surprises,'' said Edward Porter, a senior economist at
the American Petroleum Institute, citing the economic turmoil in
Asia and Russia as well as unusually warm weather in the United
States, as well as the U.N. decision permitting increased exports
by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Charles O. Verrill, Jr., the lead lawyer for Save Domestic Oil,
said the major American oil companies opposed the complaint because
they are the main customers of Mexico and the other countries and
want the lowest possible prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have steadily reduced their exploration and production in
the United States,'' Verrill said. ``They have sold much of that
production to the independents and increased their refining
capacity, making them dependent on imported oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Richardson, the secretary of energy, said last month that
he had tried unsuccessfully to meet with Save Domestic Oil
representatives and that he was ``extremely concerned'' about the
potential impact of their charges on consumers and trade relations.

UAW OFFICIAL'S DEATH PUTS LABOR-CONTRACT FOCUS ON FORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The unexpected death of a labor leader over the
weekend makes it likely that the Ford Motor Co. will be the lead
company in labor negotiations covering the auto industry's 405,000
blue-collar workers.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Laskowski, a vice president of the United Automobile
Workers union, died on Sunday, apparently of a heart attack, the
union said Monday. Laskowski, 59, led the labor team negotiating
with DaimlerChrysler AG.
</P>
<P>
   Three-year labor contracts with DaimlerChrysler, Ford and the
General Motors Corp. expire on Sept. 14, and the auto industry is
busily negotiating new contracts with the union.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, each company proposes terms for a new contract and
the union chooses the best offer, then begins negotiating with a
single auto maker. Once it reaches agreement with that company, it
requires the other two auto makers to follow the same pattern in
their union contracts. The union's top concern this year is job
security.
</P>
<P>
   With a leadership vacuum created by the death of Laskowski,
DaimlerChrysler seems unlikely to be chosen. GM is also unlikely to
become the target company because it has a poor relationship with
the union. That leaves Ford, which has the closest relationship
with the union and has set the pattern during the last two
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW has not yet named a successor for Laskowski, but the
union's board met as scheduled Monday. The union is expected to
announce late this month or in early September which company will
be the negotiating target.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, workers nationwide are scheduled to vote to authorize
strikes at each company, as is the custom entering the final
stretch of negotiations.

ADVANCED MICRO INTRODUCES A FASTER CHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a make-or-break move, Advanced Micro Devices
Inc. introduced a microprocessor Monday with higher performance
than the fastest chips made by the Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   With a top speed of 650 MHz, Advanced Micro's new chip, known as
the Athlon, edges out Intel, which just last week introduced a
600-MHz version of its flagship microprocessor, the Pentium III.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro said the International Business Machines Corp.
and the Compaq Computer Corp. had already committed themselves to
using the Athlon in some computers. Shipments to computer
manufacturers began last month, the company said, adding that it
expected PCs that use the chip to be available later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro shares closed at $19.25, up $1.875, on the New
York Stock Exchange. Intel shares closed at $73.4375, up $1.875, in
NASDAQ trading.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro has been locked in a price war with Intel that
has left the company awash in red ink. Without a high-performance
product, the company has had no choice but to battle Intel at the
low end. But Intel can afford to offer deep discounts on its
low-end products, partly because it has the most efficient
manufacturing operations in the business, and partly because the
slim margins are offset by premium pricing for high-end processors
used in work stations and servers.
</P>
<P>
   The Athlon is available in a range of clock speeds, from 500 to
650 MHz, but Advanced Micro said that at each speed, its chip
outperformed the comparable Pentium III.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a technical standpoint, it is the strongest product AMD
has ever shipped,'' said Michael Slater, editor of The
Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter. ``Pretty much no
matter now you measure it, it comes out stronger than Pentium III.
If they can now deliver on its potential, it clearly could change
their position in the marketplace. They now can compete at the high
end, where Intel cannot be as aggressive, because they need the
profit margins from those products.''
</P>
<P>
   The big question is whether Advanced Micro can deliver Athlon
chips in a timely manner and in volumes large enough to matter. The
company has introduced faster chips than Intel's products in the
past only to stumble in manufacturing and to cede the market
opportunity to its rival.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of S. Atiq Raza last month as Advanced Micro's
president and chief operating officer is also cause for concern as
the company faces the challenge of producing the Athlon.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the 650-MHz AMD Athlon processor is priced at
$849 when purchased in 1,000-unit lots; the 600-MHz AMD Athlon
processor is priced at $615; the 550-MHz AMD Athlon processor is
priced at $449; and the 500-MHz AMD Athlon processor is priced at
$249.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's 600-MHz Pentium III is $669; the 550-MHz processor is
$658; the 500-MHz processor is $423; and the 450-MHz processor is
$230.
</P>
<P>
   Another question is whether there is a volume market for
high-performance processors, when a low-end Celeron from Intel _
or, indeed, Advanced Micro's own K-6 processor _ meets most
people's needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had they introduced this product three years ago, the market
would have been clamoring for it, but the need and price support
for high-performance Intel-compatible processors have evaporated,''
said Drew Peck, an analyst with S.G. Cowen. ``Given the woeful
state of software, the performance advantage may not be noticeable
at all, so you could not expect well-informed customers to pay a
premium for it.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As a teen-ager growing up in the San Fernando
Valley, Regina Jacobs exhibited promise at 13 when she first laced
up her track shoes. Nearly two decades later, Jacobs, now 35, is
living that promise.
</P>
<P>
   A three-time U.S. Olympian at 1,500 meters, Jacobs is among the
favorites in the metric mile in the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having a blast and so much fun,'' she said. ``It's really
thrilling to be achieving goals that I always sought when I was
younger. I have been blessed to pursue these goals year after
year.''
</P>
<P>
   At the USA Track &AMP; Field Championships in June, Jacobs became
the first woman to win the 1,500 and 5,000 meters in the same year.
In July, she added an American record in the 1,000 meters at the
Maine Distance Carnival to go along with her national 5,000
standard set at the meet in 1998. She has also lowered her personal
best in the 800 meters this season.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs now holds the distinction as the only woman besides Mary
Slaney to be ranked among the top 10 from the 800 to the 5,000 on
the all-time U.S. list.
</P>
<P>
   A gold medal in the World Championships is next on the wish list
for the 1981 graduate of Argyll Academy (now Campbell Hall). Jacobs
is preparing not only physically but mentally for the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the 1999 World Champion at 1,500 meters, Seville, Spain''
is written on a 3x5 card taped to the microwave oven in her Oakland
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of us are real perfectionists,'' Jacobs said of herself
and husband Tom Craig, her coach since 1992
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at the way (my competitors) train and what
they're doing. I don't want to be the one who hasn't dotted all her
i's and crossed all her t's. It's like a small business. We're
trying to take the chance out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hooking up with Craig in 1992 has been Jacob's best gamble. She
had just taken a year-and-a-half off from competition while
finishing her MBA at Cal. With the recession and a lack of jobs,
Jacobs opted to pursue running full-time under Craig. They were
married in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the boss on the track, and when we're at home, I
surrender to her,'' said Craig, a director for a health-and-fitness
energy-bar company. ``I'm halfway bright, but I am not just some
great coach. We figured out our roles and turned what could be a
disaster into a great package.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs attended Stanford after graduating from Argyll Academy.
As a freshman in 1982, Jacobs was fourth in the 800 in the NCAA
championships and was the runner-up in the NCAA cross country
championships as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   The next eight years, however, were filled with erratic
performances. After finishing last in the 1,500 in the 1993
national championships, Jacobs visited a hematologist who found she
had chronically low levels of iron in her blood. With the use of
regular iron supplements and focusing exclusively on running,
Jacobs has reached new levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a master of dabbling in a little bit of this and a
little bit of that,'' she said. ``Being competitive on the national
level is not the same as being competitive on an international
level. I was very content to make the teams and win the national,
and Tom was the first person to raise me up to different
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs' success in part has been due to a steady progression of
injury-free workouts over the last seven years. In 1997, Jacobs was
ranked No. 2 in the world in the 1,500, and has been ranked the top
1,500 runner in the U.S. in four of the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Starting a family is a high priority for Jacobs, who will turn
36 on Aug. 28. For now, it is limited to her miniature poodle,
Floyd, who accompanies Jacobs on interval workouts and training
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs has made a commitment to train until the 2001 World
Championships in Edmonton. And possibly beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really think I'm doing anything different or new,''
she said. ``There have been many other women who have proven you
can keep on doing it. If you really pay attention and take care of
your body, you can keep building on your fitness. I hope the
message I send to young women is that you don't quit. If you love
what you're doing and think you're getting better, you should keep
going.''

REGULATORS REPORT ABUSES BY DAY-TRADING FIRMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to correct name to James H. Lee in 16th graf of 1st take. No
other changes.)   (mk) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Many day-trading firms use deceptive marketing
practices to lure customers into a rapid-fire stock trading
strategy that will probably cause them to lose money, and then they
help to keep them trading by arranging what could be illegal loans,
a group of state securities regulators said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a report condemning many practices of day-trading firms, the
state regulators urged the firms to do a better job of screening
potential customers and to disclose more fully the substantial
risks of their investment practices.
</P>
<P>
   The state group, the North American Securities Administrators
Association, also asked national securities regulators to step up
their enforcement of trading rules and to ban some of the
day-trading industry's most common lending practices.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of firms that promote day trading strongly opposed
the report's conclusions, saying that the results were based on
practices that are not representative of the industry. Rather, the
executives said, the report's conclusions stem from enforcement
actions at a minority of the industry's branch offices.
</P>
<P>
   Day trading drew widespread national attention last month when
Mark Barton shot and killed nine people at the Atlanta offices of
two day-trading firms where he had lost an estimated half a million
dollars trading stocks. The state regulators' report, which had
been in the works for months before the Atlanta shootings, cited
questionable practices at the Massachusetts office of one of those
firms, All-Tech Investment Group, which in December was barred from
doing business in the state for two years. The other firm attacked
by Barton, Momentum Securities, was not cited for questionable
practices, but is one of the nation's largest day-trading firms,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Day trading is generally defined as a strategy in which
individuals make scores of stock trades each day trying to exploit
small movements in share prices. In contrast to most forms of
investing, day traders hold no securities overnight or for longer
terms.
</P>
<P>
   That form of rapid in-and-out trading can produce returns of up
to 12 percent a day for retirees, laid-off executives, college
students and others, according to the promotional materials of some
day-trading firms. But in fact, the regulatory group said, most day
traders lose most if not all of their money within the first few
months.
</P>
<P>
   To keep unsuccessful traders from giving up, day-trading firms
promote and arrange loans from one customer to another, allowing
some traders to cover losses and to continue speculating, the group
said. In one case, a branch manager forged customer signatures on
loan documents, the regulators said, and allegedly had an agreement
to split profits with the customers as part of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Any time they broker a deal between a lender and a customer,
these firms are violating the spirit of rules that prevent
brokerage firms from direct lending, regulators say. Such rules are
designed to keep individuals from trading beyond their means, the
regulators said.
</P>
<P>
   William Galvin, secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
whose office oversees the state's securities regulators, said
day-trading firms that promote lending between customers do so
``using the same rhetoric as bunko artists and Ponzi schemes.''
</P>
<P>
   Day trading is certainly a risky investment practice, but the
report on day trading has several shortcomings that suggest that it
may be more of a snapshot than a comprehensive look at the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being seven months in the making, the report does not
independently quantify how many Americans are practicing day
trading or attempt to determine how much activity they account for
in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   One of the regulatory group's most intriguing findings was that
only 11.5 percent of traders at a single firm in Massachusetts
demonstrated the ability to conduct profitable short-term trading,
while 70 percent lost money. But those results came from an
All-Tech day-trading office that was shut down by Massachusetts
authorities last year for violating securities laws, suggesting
that the firm's customers and their experience may not be typical.
The study examined 30 trading accounts, 17 of which were deemed to
contain true day-trading activity.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Lerner, general counsel of All-Tech Investment Group,
said: ``The Massachusetts office was a bad office being run by a
bad manager. It is not typical.''
</P>
<P>
   Some other findings were based on examinations of 35 day-trading
offices or firms by regulators in four states: Colorado, Texas,
Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. Those examinations have resulted in
13 enforcement orders, and 10 additional investigations are
pending, said David Shellenberger, chief of licensing at the
Massachusetts Securities Division and chairman of the day-trading
task force that prepared the report.
</P>
<P>
   That sample represents a small portion of the day-trading
industry, which the task force said encompasses at least 287 branch
offices serving 62 firms. In March, the Electronic Traders
Association, a trade group headed by James H. Lee of Momentum, said
that 4,000 to 5,000 individuals were active day traders, but
estimates vary greatly and it is hard to say how many people are
active at one time and how many people may have multiple accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Shellenberger said that the state group's report was intended
``to relate the collective experience'' of regulators in their
interactions with day-trading firms. ``I think the problems we
found are pervasive in the industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials blasted the report. ``It's such a piece of
trash it's pathetic,'' said Ms. Lerner of All-Tech Investment
Group. To determine profit potential, regulators examined 17
accounts of the firm's defunct Massachusetts office. ``We have more
than 2,000 accounts, so it's hardly a representative sample,'' Ms.
Lerner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Electronic Traders Association said in a statement that it
supported improved disclosure by day-trading firms; in addition, it
issued a statement of ethical principles for its member firms. But
it added that the use of inter-customer loans is longstanding in
the securities industry.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators cited several examples of what they called
misleading marketing. In the case of All-Tech, Massachusetts
regulators found that the firm's branch office manual provided
``guidance to branch managers in overcoming the objections of
prospective customers,'' including being intentionally vague in
discussing ``success ratios,'' or what portion of customers traded
profitably.
</P>
<P>
   Another firm, On-Line Investment Services, claimed on its Web
site ``a success rate of around 85 percent,'' but when asked by the
state securities division for proof of the claim, the firm deleted
the information and denied the claim.
</P>
<P>
   And TCI Corp., a day-trading firm not related to the
better-known cable television company, said on its Web site that
customers earned 12 percent a day before commission. But when
questioned by regulators, the firm admitted that the figure was
based on buy and sell signals posted the week following market
activity _ a practice Massachusetts securities officials deemed
``analogous to predicting the prior week's weather.''
</P>
<P>
   The state regulators said they also intend to shine a brighter
light on loans made between day-trading customers. At one firm,
Landmark Securities, transfers between customer accounts totaled
$2.7 million over a nine-month period. But for some of the loans,
regulators said a branch manager forged customer signatures on
forms approving the transfers.
</P>
<P>
   Other loan practices, while not illegal, raise questions about
whether customers are being fairly advised of their best interests,
the group said. For example, the branch manager of one firm had a
profit interest in the company that made loans to customers.
</P>
<P>
   The state securities group also charged that some of the
inter-customer loans, which entail interest charges of up to 0.1
percent a day _ or 36.5 percent a year _ violate state usury laws.
In addition, some customers do not pay back their loans _ leaving
other customers, rather then the day-trading firm, on the hook.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Monday that he will introduce
legislation to ensure that day traders are aware of the risks
associated with the practice. The proposed legislation will require
a uniform disclosure statement to be signed by all day-trading
customers and prohibit certain types of loans to day traders, he
said. In addition, he said he will call on the Federal Trade
Commission to examine the industry's advertising practices.
</P>
<P>
   The very existence of the day-trading phenomenon is paradoxical,
the state regulators concluded. For individuals who want to
speculate, the futures and options markets present ample
opportunity, at lower cost and greater leverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps day traders are aware that retail customers usually
lose money trading futures and options, so they wish to trade a
seemingly safer vehicle,'' the report states. ``This usually
results in the slower loss of capital, but in loss nonetheless.''

CLINTON GIVES MEDALS AND COMPLIMENTS TO THE CARTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ President Clinton on Monday presented former President
Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn with the Medal of Freedom,
saying the Carters have ``done more good things for more people
than any other couple on the face of the Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Handing out the country's highest civilian award, Clinton set
aside the history of a relationship that has often been mutually
disappointing, and gave compliments to match in an evening ceremony
at the Carter Center here. He compared Carter to the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. and Mrs. Carter to Eleanor Roosevelt. In
response, a grinning Carter called the occasion ``one of the most
beautiful events of my life.'' And, he said, ``it's especially
meaningful to receive it from a leader who's pursued many of the
same goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Carter, who touched the medal almost shyly as Clinton
slipped it around her neck, cried as she talked about her work in
eradicating guinea worm in small African villages, saying, ``That's
not work, Mr. President.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter offered Clinton some advice about life after the White
House and said that after he was voted out of office in 1980, ``We
left Washington in something of despair and embarrassment and
frustration. We didn't know what we were going to do, and I was
about your age. I found out from some friends at the CDC I still
had 25 years of life expectancy and what was I going to do with
it?''
</P>
<P>
   The two presidents also traded gentle jokes: Clinton laughingly
suggested that Carter might have sent Jody Powell down to Arkansas
to help him lose his first run for office, when he ran for Congress
in 1974. And Carter noted that after Clinton leaves the White
House, ``You'll be able to play golf without any telephoto lens
focusing on your stroke, but there is a downside; I understand
golfing partners don't give as many mulligans,'' or do-over shots,
to ex-presidents.
</P>
<P>
   But the moment also seemed to bring the Carter-Clinton
friendship full circle at a time when imagining the contours of a
life after the presidency is of special interest to Clinton. He was
Carter's state chairman in Arkansas when the Georgia governor ran
for president in 1976, and occasionally attended dinners and
briefings in the Carter White House.
</P>
<P>
   But relations became more difficult while Clinton was governor
of Arkansas, when hundreds of Cuban refugees who had come to the
United States in the Mariel boat lift rioted and broke out of their
resettlement camp at Fort Chaffee, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Even after it became clear that that situation was likely to
hurt Clinton's chances for re-election, the Carter administration
reneged on a promise that no more Cubans would be sent to Arkansas.
Instead, camps in several other states were consolidated and all
their refugees sent there.
</P>
<P>
   Later, not long after winning the 1992 presidential race,
Clinton asked Carter, who was eager to discuss foreign policy with
him, to instead deal directly with his secretary of state, Warren
Christopher, who did not return his phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   A week before Clinton's inauguration in 1993, Carter gave an
interview to The New York Times in which he said he was ``very
disappointed'' in the Clintons' decision to send Chelsea to an
exclusive private school and recalled how much his own daughter,
Amy, had enjoyed attending Washington's public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Carter also ventured that Clinton had been turned out of the
Arkansas Governor's Mansion in 1980 not because of the rioting
refugees but because voters wanted to bring him ``down a notch.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, some in the Clinton circle indulged talk of
un-inviting the Carters to the inaugural festivities. The way the
Clintons ignored the Carters when they did appear for the
celebration was hardly less of a snub, according to Mrs. Carter,
who told Douglas Brinkley, author of The Unfinished Presidency:
Jimmy Carter's Journey Beyond the White House, ``It was rude beyond
belief. Not even Reagan would have done a thing like that.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when tensions with North Korea over its nuclear program
were running high, Carter successfully intervened, but embarrassed
the Clinton administration in the process. North Korea had for some
time been producing plutonium potentially adaptable to nuclear
weapons, and while insisting it was pursuing peaceful purposes,
eventually withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   With North Korea refusing to allow international inspectors to
do their job and the United States pushing for sanctions, Clinton
approved Carter's plan to accept an invitation to go there _ but
with the explicit understanding that he was doing so as a private
citizen. In North Korea, Kim Il Sung told Carter that in exchange
for help in getting modern light-water reactors for his country, he
would agree to a nuclear freeze, outside inspections and re-entry
into the non-proliferation treaty.
</P>
<P>
   But then Carter infuriated Clinton officials by immediately
going on CNN to announce that an end to the crisis was at hand,
automatically limiting Clinton's options. And though North Korea
did later sign an agreement halting its nuclear program, pundits
debating which American president was calling the shots for a time
credited ``Jimmy Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Carter weighed in on the Lewinsky scandal, saying he
had ``deplored and been deeply embarrassed by what occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, Carter could hardly have been more grateful, or
Clinton more laudatory, praising Carter's work on human rights and
on the Middle East peace process, as well as his record on hiring
women and minorities in his administration and on promoting peace
around the world since leaving Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He said Mrs. Carter will ``always be remembered as a pioneer on
mental health and a champion of our children.'' Working together,
he said, ``In many ways, this center has been their ministry.''

VLADIMIR PUTIN: RUSSIA'S NEW PREMIER STEPS OUT OF SHADOWS AND INTO
SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to change `newly named' to `newly nominated.')  (With RUSSIA-POLITICS)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Vladimir Putin is not a household name.
</P>
<P>
   This much the Kremlin was ready to acknowledge Monday after the
46-year-old chief of Russia's domestic intelligence service and
newly nominated prime minister was introduced to a stunned Russian
public as the man President Boris Yeltsin wants as his successor in
a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Putin does face a problem, '' said Dmitri Yakushkin,
Yeltsin's press secretary, at a briefing Monday afternoon, ``it is
that people know less about him than about other prominent
politicians due to the specifics of his work.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else is being said about Russia's newest presidential
aspirant, that much is uncontested. Most of his career has been
spent in the background, as befits a man who began as a foreign
intelligence agent for the old KGB, where he rose to the rank of
lieutenant colonel.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview Monday night, Putin _ a tall man with
icy blue eyes and a deadpan expression _ was more cautious than
informative, tying up his answers in tight knots. He managed one
half-smile during the half-hour conversation. He did make one joke
_ really a play on words _ when his interviewer asked what he would
do if people ``go out and sit on the rails,'' as protesting miners
did last summer on the Trans-Siberian Railroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go out, or sit?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go out,'' was the reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they will sit,'' he said, using the expression for going
to jail.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from law school in 1975, Putin by his own
admission served for many years as a KGB officer in Germany.
Returning to his native Leningrad _ Russia's second-largest city,
later renamed St. Petersburg _ he joined the international affairs
department at Leningrad State University. From there in 1990, he
joined the team of Mayor Anatoly Sobchak, a leader of Russia's
early democratic movement. According to one report Monday, Sobchak
was Putin's law professor at university.
</P>
<P>
   As a deputy mayor, and then first vice mayor, Putin was in
charge of international relations at Smolny, the building that had
served as Lenin's headquarters in the 1917 revolution, which now
houses the St. Petersburg mayor's office. He reportedly became
known as the city administration's ``gray cardinal,'' an
indispensable adviser regarded with respect and a touch of fear.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Torrence, an American consultant who arrived in St.
Petersburg in 1992 as an unpaid adviser to the Sobchak city hall,
said he worked closely with Putin, whom he describes as a ``most
intelligent and amazing man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin was a discovery for me,'' Torrence said in a telephone
interview, ``a quiet person, extremely hard-working, who was
subscribed totally to what Sobchak stood for. He was very loyal.''
</P>
<P>
   Torrence said Putin was instrumental in cutting through the
local bureaucracy so the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. could open a plant in
the city. Putin, who speaks fluent German, reportedly also helped
the Dresdner Bank of Germany become the first foreign bank to set
up offices in St. Petersburg, which at the time had ambitions of
becoming Russia's financial center.
</P>
<P>
   He also headed the St. Petersburg chapter of Our Home Is Russia,
a party begun in 1995 to support Yeltsin's allies in the
parliamentary elections. Afterward Putin was called to Moscow,
where he joined other members of Yeltsin's St. Petersburg team,
among them Anatoly Chubais, the former chief of Russia's
privatization program.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's jobs in Moscow included running the Kremlin's control
department, an internal auditing office, and handling the
administration's relations with Russia's 89 regions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 he was named head of the Federal Security Service, as
the domestic branch of the old KGB is called. He kept that job
after he was also nominated secretary of the advisory Security
Council. The second post, like so many others in the Kremlin, has
proved a merry-go-round for Yeltsin's sometime favorites, from the
gruff former Gen. Aleksandr Lebed to the omnipresent financier
Boris Berezovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on Putin's appointment Monday, Gennady Zyuganov, head
of Russia's Communist Party, dismissed him as a copy of his
predecessor, Sergei Stepashin, a former head of the Interior
Ministry, which like the Federal Security Service is a so-called
power ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the difference between them?'' asked Zyuganov in a
radio interview. ``Both are from Leningrad. Both come from the same
democratic team. Both unreservedly support Yeltsin and his course.
Both come from the `power ministries,' neither has experience of
economic management, neither of them has a party or a movement or
strong support. Both have to serve someone who has trouble
controlling himself.''
</P>
<P>
   But if loyalty is the main prerequisite for a long career inside
the presidential administration, then Putin has passed the test. In
his interview Monday night on NTV, Russia's largest privately owned
television station, he even made his own presidential ambitions
sound as though they had been ordered by a superior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be awkward if I said I wasn't ready if the president
said I was,'' he said.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ As the race to succeed him next year threatens to slip
out of his control, Russian President Boris Yeltsin tipped his
hand, and Russia's political apple cart, by firing his prime
minister on Monday and replacing him with a former KGB officer and
loyal aide who he said was his favorite to become the next
president.
</P>
<P>
   From a politician who regularly uses surprise as a weapon,
Yeltsin's latest move, nominating Vladimir Putin (pronounced
POO-teen) to succeed Sergei Stepashin _ his fourth government
shake-up in 17 months _ was met with more dismay than shock. Even
former allies accused him of playing politics at the expense of the
increasingly fragile authority of Russia's central government.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this smacks very much of the agony and madness of the
Kremlin, and it is all hard to explain,'' said Boris Nemtsov, a
former member of Yeltsin's team who himself was once tapped briefly
as a potential heir. ``The only explanation that comes to mind is
that Yeltsin does not believe that Stepashin can be his successor
or thinks he is unworthy of being his successor.''
</P>
<P>
   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov was even more biting.
``Who will take any prime minister seriously if they are changed
like gloves?'' he asked in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
   Although Putin, 46, quickly sought to reassure the country, and
the current cabinet that he would make no changes, news of
Stepashin's abrupt dismissal caused a drop in the value of the
Russian ruble, and knocked down prices on Russia's stock exchange,
which in recent months had been rebounding from last August's
devastating financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As Muscovites openly voiced their disgust at the Kremlin's
latest game of musical chairs, Western governments and the
International Monetary Fund _ holders of Russia's mountain of debts
_ were more cautious, saying publicly that they were certain Moscow
would keep to its promised course.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin and later Putin reassured Russians that they intend to
have the nation's scheduled elections go ahead as planned. ``In one
year for the first time in the country's history the first
president of Russia will transfer power to a fresh, newly elected
president.'' Yeltsin said in a televised address to the nation.
``In any case he will be your president, respected Russians, he who
has won in honest and clean elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin, a former interior minister and faithful Yeltsin
supporter who was catapulted into the prime minister's job just
three months ago, was unexpectedly called to the Kremlin early
Monday morning and told he was being fired.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before, Stepashin had flown back to Moscow from the
southern province of Dagestan where he had been dispatched to
oversee efforts by federal forces to quell an armed rebellion by
Islamic extremists. Despite the timing, few experts think that
Stepashin's handling of the flare-up of violence in the volatile
north Caucasus was the immediate reason for Yeltsin's decision to
dismiss him.
</P>
<P>
   In his televised address to the nation, Yeltsin made no specific
criticisms of Stepashin, but made it clear that the 47-year-old
soft-spoken former police officer had failed to qualify as a strong
presidential contender capable of keeping Yeltsin's foes at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Yeltsin praised Putin as ``the person capable of
consolidating society, the person who, basing himself on the
broadest political forces, is capable of ensuring a continuation of
reforms in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I trust him,'' said the president, who spoke slowly, looking
straight at the camera. ``But I also want all those who in July
2000 will come to the polling stations and make their choice to
have similar confidence in him. I think Putin will have enough time
to show his worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin on Monday also officially opened Russia's election
season by signing a formal decree setting Dec. 19 as the date for
elections to the 450-seat lower house of the parliament, or Duma.
Presidential elections are to follow in July 2000, when Yeltsin's
second and final term comes to an end, according to the Russian
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's anointment of Putin on Monday was another confirmation
that the battle over who will lead Russia into the post-Yeltsin era
is already underway. An opening shot was fired last week not by the
presidential administration, but by Moscow's ambitious Mayor Yuri
Luzhkov, and a handful of regional governors who formed an
electoral alliance in defiance of the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   That alliance, which many believe will attract former Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov back into politics, ultimately as a
presidential candidate, may have triggered Yeltsin's abrupt move
Monday. For several days, Russian newspapers have speculated that
the president would cast about for ways to regain the political
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's nomination must now be confirmed by the Duma, which is
scheduled to return from vacation and take its first vote on the
new prime minister next Monday. If it votes three times against the
president's candidate, the Russian constitution says it must be
disbanded. Since a majority of parliamentary deputies don't want to
lose their seats and privileges before the December elections, most
analysts expect that Putin _ like Stepashin before him _ will be
approved.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, having been through this drill repeatedly
during the Yeltsin presidency, attempted to play down the
significance of the Russian leader's latest government shake-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should blow this out of proportion,'' said
James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman. ``We have focused
our policy on the policies of Russian reform and the policies of
the Russian government, not the personalities.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added, . ``We do have some experience with Mr. Putin and
have a constructive relationship with him.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Putin, a former KGB agent who spent years in Germany during the
Cold War era, came to Moscow in 1996 from St. Petersburg where he
had served as first vice mayor to Mayor Anatoli Sobchak, one of the
leaders of Russia's early democratic movement. He served as
Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff and since last year as head of
Russia's internal intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kremlin, where his most recent job was secretary to the
Security Council, he has maintained a low-profile but has a
reputation as a tough administrator, whose power lies largely in
his continuing command of the domestic branch of the old KGB.
</P>
<P>
   Like Stepashin, Putin has no direct experience in electoral
politics and his cool, aloof manner sets him apart from Russia's
other more loquacious politicians. But analysts here suggest that
he was favored for the role of presidential aspirant because he may
be more ready than his predecessor to use his office to bring
Russia's powerful regional leaders in line behind the Kremlin's
election strategy.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Russia's governors, who hold executive power in the country's 89
regions, have become an increasingly powerful force on the national
political scene, as Moscow takes stock of their considerable
influence on voters back home, through local media, budgets and
their hold on local businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin, named prime minister in May after Yeltsin fired
Primakov, had tried to stay out of partisan politics, even as
Yeltsin's inner circle _ which includes his chief of staff
Aleksandr Voloshin and his youngest daughter Tatyana Dyachenko _
spent the summer picking fights with that part of the Russian media
that has cast its lot with Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   In a telling interview given to the newspaper Izvestia last
Friday, Stepashin pledged to keep a neutral role in the upcoming
election battles, which may not have been the message the Kremlin
wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even if he proves to be a more effective political player, few
observers Monday gave Putin a real chance to become a viable
presidential candidate, given the depth of popular antipathy to his
mentor. For more than a year now, Yeltsin's own popularity rating
has been in the single digits, as broad swaths of the Russian
population _ from disgruntled pensioners to disgusted entrepreneurs
_ blame him for the country's economic stagnation and rampant
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``A recommendation by Mr. Yeltsin, this is the kiss of death,''
said Leonid Dobrokhotov, an adviser to Zyuganov, the Communist
Party leader.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the universal loathing of him in the country, any
recommendation by him of any politician, even the best, points the
way to the grave,'' Dobrokhotov said. ``We are on the finishing
line of the Yeltsin regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Anatoly Chubais, a leader of a new right-wing party made up
of top liberal reformers, was quoted by one news agency source
Monday as saying that Stepashin's removal was ``a very risky step
with possible grave political consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As he demonstrated Monday, Yeltsin is still willing to wield the
considerable power vested in his office to try to turn the
political tide. As in the hard-fought election campaign of 1996, he
and his administration can still use or withhold money from the
federal budget to reward or punish wayward regional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But some politicians say that even these powers have diminished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two, three years ago, he had these opportunities, and he used
those opportunities,'' said Vladimir Ryzhkov, a parliamentary
leader in the Our Home is Russia Party, during a television
appearance last week. ``What has happened in these days has proved
one thing: Mr. Yeltsin's power has run out. The Russian
establishment, or at least its upper layer, has turned away from
Yeltsin.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts here are divided over Yeltsin's motives. Some argue
that he is intent on bequeathing to Russia, as his parting legacy,
a government and a president who are committed to completing the
country's transformation into a functioning democracy, with a
market-based economy. The rise of a Primakov-Luzhkov team, backed
by a coalition made up of Soviet-era industrial directors and some
of Russia's more autocratic governors, is seen by Yeltsin's circle
as a threat to those goals.
</P>
<P>
   But others see Yeltsin as a lame-duck politician who is
desperately struggling to guarantee his immunity, and that of his
family, once he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is in a state of panic,'' said Dobrokhotov. ``He is not
concerned about his legacy, or about Russia and its fate.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dobrokhotov said Yeltsin is afraid of ``a Ceausescu scenario,''
referring to the summary execution in December 1989 of Romania's
despised communist dictator, ``of being forced to pay the bill for
the terrible crisis he has put the country through.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as some caution, a year is a long time in Russian
politics where alliances and promises can evaporate as quickly as
they are made. And Yeltsin's renewed activity suggests that he will
do his best to win back control of political events.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Berezovsky, a prominent financier and media magnate whose
influence in the Kremlin rose after the fall of his arch-foe,
Primakov, suggested in an interview Monday with the news agency
Interfax that Yeltsin's strategy has not yet been fully laid out.
</P>
<P>
   According to Berezovsky, the dismissal of Stepashin is part of
the Kremlin's plan to ``create their own political force capable of
fighting for parliament.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The next two or three weeks will clarify the reasons for this
decision,'' he said.

BANK ROBBERY SUSPECT SHOT TO DEATH BY POLICE NEAR WALL STREET 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Spelling of `Chmielnicki' in 7th graf is correct.) 
(yn) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As lunchtime crowds scrambled for cover, the police
shot to death a bank robbery suspect near Wall Street Monday after
he pulled a gun on them. A bystander was also wounded in the
chaotic scene.
</P>
<P>
   Gunfire echoed through the canyons of the Financial District as
people thronged the streets for lunch on one of the few cool
workdays of the summer. People described cowering behind planters
and garbage bins as officers unleashed dozens of shots at the
fleeing suspect, who had apparently been wounded by the police when
they first confronted him in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The gunfire erupted just blocks from the Federal Reserve Bank
and the New York Stock Exchange, and witnesses described a panicky
scene as people dived for cover. They said that at least one man
appeared to have been injured in the stampede.
</P>
<P>
   All told, a half-dozen police officers fired more than 35 shots
at the suspected robber, a senior police official said. And while
several civilian witnesses reported seeing the man shoot at the
police, the official said, crime scene detectives had yet to find
any forensic evidence, such as spent shell casings, to prove that
he had fired his weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Magid, 57, was delivering a door to the area. ``I was
coming out of my truck with the door, and I see a lot of people
coming out of the building and hear about a dozen shots. A police
officer says, ```Duck _ get out of the way!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I left the door on the floor _ I just dropped it right
there,'' Magid said. ``Fifteen minutes later I picked it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Chmielnicki, a legal secretary who works a block away,
said that she was sitting on a bench just outside the glass walls
of the bank when the shooting started. ``The door just shattered,''
she recalled. ``I thought it had blown out or something. Then I
heard the shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The police then rushed her to safety behind one of the planters
that line Cedar Street, where she skinned her leg diving for cover.
``I was saying `Thank God' because I wasn't shot,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The chase and gunfire began when the police were called to the
HSBC Bank at 140 Broadway, near Cedar Street, around 12:50 p.m.
after employees there spotted a man they believe had robbed their
branch in June, said Assistant Chief William Taylor, the commander
of Manhattan detectives. When the first police officer entered the
bank's lobby, the police said, the robbery suspect took out a
handgun and trained it on her.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the suspect fired at the officer was still unclear
Monday night, officials said. The police officer, Bernadette
Batignani, 29, a six-year veteran, began shooting at the suspect
when he refused repeated commands to drop his weapon, the police
said. The wounded gunman then made his way into the street, where
he was shot by more officers, and eventually ran around the corner
to Pine Street near Broadway, where he finally collapsed, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Rosenberg, 59, who works for the city's Department of
Sanitation, was shot in the buttocks as she stood at Cedar and
Nassau Streets, the police said. It was not clear on Monday night
whether Ms. Rosenberg was shot by the police officers or by the
bank robbery suspect, police officials said. She was taken to
Bellevue Hospital, where she was listed in stable condition, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The police were working to identify the dead man on Monday
night. Identification found in his wallet bore the name Robert
Striker, 54, several police officials said. But police officials
said they would check the dead man's fingerprints Tuesday, after an
autopsy is performed, before officially identifying him as Striker,
who has been arrested more than 20 times since 1962 and who
sometimes used the alias Jesse James.
</P>
<P>
   The man's weapon, a .25-caliber semi-automatic handgun, was
found on Cedar and Nassau Streets, the senior police official said,
adding that the gun, which can usually fire six or seven shots, had
two rounds in it.

VICTOR MATURE, `BEEFCAKE' FILM STAR OF '40S AND '50S 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to note age discrepancies in lede. Accordingly, deletes
specific date of birth in 14th graf and deletes age from hed.)  (Eds: A longer version of this obit, OBIT-MATURE-NYT, will be

 By ALJEAN HARMETZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Victor Mature, who attained movie stardom dressed in a wooly
mammoth loincloth, died on Wednesday in San Diego County, Calif. He
was 86, according to the Motion Picture Almanac, although other
references have put him at 83 or 84.
</P>
<P>
   He died of cancer, said Zollie Volchok, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Bare-chested and bare-armed, Mature in his long career in
Hollywood sported a variety of loincloths, togas and leotards _ as
the prehistoric hunter, Tumak, in the movie that made him a star in
1940, ``One Million B.C.''; as the Greek slave, Demetrius, who
became a fervent Christian in ``The Robe'' (1953) and who later
demonstrated muscular Christianity in ``Demetrius and the
Gladiators'' (1954); as the dashing lion killer in ``The Egyptian''
(1954); and as the long-haired Samson who succumbed to the wiles of
Hedy Lamarr in Cecil B. DeMille's ``Samson and Delilah'' (1949).
</P>
<P>
   The word ``Beefcake'' may have been coined to define Mature's
broad shoulders, narrow waist, curly hair and sensual face crowned
by dazzling white teeth. In his first Broadway role, he played the
gorgeous movie star who wooed Gertrude Lawrence in the hit Broadway
musical ``Lady in the Dark'' (1941). His costumes included pink
circus tights topped by leopard skin briefs and he managed not to
be an anticlimax even after being described as ``the most beautiful
hunk of man you ever saw in your life'' before his arrival on
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Never an actor who took himself too seriously, Mature was fond
of telling the story of how he was rejected for membership in the
Los Angeles Country Club because the club did not accept actors. He
told a reporter that he had replied, ``Hell, I'm no actor, and I've
got 28 pictures and a scrapbook of reviews to prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, some of his reviews were good. Under the direction of
John Ford, he held his own against Henry Fonda's Wyatt Earp,
playing the dying Doc Holliday, the Eastern doctor turned
tubercular Western gambler in ``My Darling Clementine'' (1946). In
the movie he handled Hamlet's ``To Be or Not To Be'' soliloquy
without embarrassing himself or the audience.
</P>
<P>
   And in the film noir ``Kiss of Death'' (1947) he was widely
praised for his work as Nick Bianco, a small-time crook who wants
to go straight but who is menaced by Richard Widmark's giggling
psychopathic killer Tommy Udo. It was perhaps his best performance.
``Victor Mature gives an unexpectedly subdued, convincing
performance,'' Pauline Kael wrote. Time magazine said the actor
``apparently needed nothing all this time but the right kind of
role.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor Mature was set on his career path as a heartthrob in his
first film, ``The Housekeeper's Daughter'' (1939). He flashed on
the screen for less than five minutes playing the bit part of a
lovesick gangster; his appearance brought 20,000 fan letters and
won him the lead in ``One Million B.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Mature told Life magazine in 1941, ``I can act, but what I've
got that the others don't have is this,'' as he pointed to his
body. The same article described him as ``proportioned like a
frappe glass'' with a 33-inch waist, 25- inch biceps and a 45-inch
chest, and standing 6 feet 2 1/2 inches tall. Life added that 300
New York models had chosen him as the man they would most like to
be marooned with on a desert island.
</P>
<P>
   Mature, who was fond of ice cream and loathed exercise,
described himself to the Saturday Evening Post in 1942 as ``the
biggest fraud that ever hit Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   But he took full advantage of the physique that nature had
offered him. He made 55 movies, married five times, earned $18
million, invested wisely, and more or less retired at the age of 46
to play golf and eat. ``There's a lot to be said for loafing if you
know how to do it gracefully,'' he said in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   From 1940 to 1950, despite losing three years when he was in the
Coast Guard during World War II, Mature starred in 17 movies,
including, in 1942, ``Footlight Serenade'' and ``Song of the
Islands'' with Betty Grable, ``My Gal Sal'' with Rita Hayworth, and
``Seven Days Leave'' with Lucille Ball. From 1950 to 1960 he
churned out 30 films.
</P>
<P>
   Then, having prospered in commercial real estate and having been
prescient enough to open stores selling television sets the year
after television began, he departed to a manor house overlooking
the ninth hole at the Rancho Santa Fe Country Club, a two-hour
drive south of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Mature was born in Louisville, Ky., the son of an
Austrian scissors grinder who had married the local doctor's
daughter. Victor was one of the three children born to Marcellus
and Clara Mature.
</P>
<P>
   Unstudious and rebellious, he was thrown out of four schools,
including the Kentucky Military Institute. A classmate there, the
comedian Jim Backus, recalled the illegal cocktail parties of lemon
soda and Aqua Velva shaving lotion that they co-hosted, and said
Mature was known as ``Cadet Slob.'' Leaving school at 15, he became
a salesman with a wholesale candy house, then went out on his own
as a candy jobber.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later he packed his car with canned goods and candy
and headed to Hollywood, armed with the following advice from his
father, who had become a success in the refrigeration business:
``As long as people think you're dumber than you are, you'll make
money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Arrived here with eleven cents and an ambition. I am going to
become an actor,'' Mature said he telegraphed his father. His
father wired back: ``Forty-three years ago I arrived in New York
with five cents and could not even speak English. You are six cents
up on me.''

 _ SF CHRON   Microsoft Case Enters a Final Phase 
 &HT;     By Tom Stein 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The long-running antitrust case against Microsoft Corp. will enter
one of its final phases today when the Department of Justice and
Microsoft file separate ``findings of fact'' to Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson, who is presiding over the trial.
<P>
   These documents will outline what each side believes to be the
undisputed facts established over the course of the trial, which
began nearly a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are likely to have wildly different
interpretations of the facts.
</P>
<P>
   The government will attempt to prove that Microsoft abused its
near-monopoly in operating systems and will focus on incriminating
e-mails, contradictory testimony from Microsoft executives and
claims that Microsoft strong-armed partners such as Intel and
Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is expected to claim that it never intended to
dominate markets and that its actions benefited consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The papers will be far from succinct. A Microsoft lawyer said
his office will submit about 400 pages of documents, while the
government is expected to file upwards of 1,000 pages, according to
observers.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft lawyer, who asked not to be identified, said his
side's papers will show that the government failed to prove that
consumers were hurt when Microsoft tied together its Internet
Explorer Web browser into its Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The compelling issue that will determine the outcome of the
case is the government has failed completely to show any consumer
harm,'' said the Microsoft lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, he said, consumers benefited because they got
Explorer for free when they bought Windows. Also, the browser was
already installed on most new PCs, so they didn't have to download
it from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer conceded that the price of Windows increased slightly
over the years but refuted criticism that this proves monopolistic
practices. ``If we really had a monopoly, the price of Windows
would be over a thousand bucks,'' he said. Windows, which operates
more than three-quarters of all personal computers, costs about
$200 at retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   The government team refused to comment on its filing. But
sources close to the government said they expect Justice to drive
home the point that Microsoft tried to win the so-called browser
war by forcing Windows users to use Microsoft's Web browser instead
of competing ones such as Netscape Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Manishin, a former antitrust attorney for the Justice
department, said he expects the government's findings of fact will
``connect the dots,'' showing that Microsoft used its near-monopoly
in operating systems to gain control of many other markets, not
just browsers.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the government's allegation that Microsoft created a
Windows-only version of Java, a programming language developed by
Sun Microsystems. Java does not require compliance with the Windows
operating systems and thus poses a potential threat to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Justice also charged that Microsoft attempted to control the
market for operating systems for servers, the powerful computers
that run corporate networks and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The company is accused of using an overly aggressive strategy to
get its NT server software into the market and muscle out the
competing Unix software from companies such as Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The server is the next frontier, and Microsoft is using the
same tactics to gain a monopoly position here,'' said Tony Picardi,
a software analyst with International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   All these actions, according to critics, add up to Microsoft
restricting competition in the market, inhibiting innovation and
ultimately hurting the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone sees it that way. Jessica Melugin, a policy
fellow with the Center for Freedom and Technology in San Francisco,
said anything that stifles the natural development of a market _
such as government interference _ is invariably a disservice to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The computer industry has changed so much since the start of
this trial, it's impossible to regulate,'' she said. ``A lot of the
government's issues with Microsoft, like its contentions over the
browser, just aren't relevant any more.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Microsoft claims that Netscape is an even more
formidable competitor in the browser market since it was purchased
last year by America Online.
</P>
<P>
   The big question, Melugin said, is, ``Does the government really
want to mess with an industry that moves so quickly?''
</P>
<P>
   The findings of fact will be made public today. Both parties
will submit revised versions on September 10 to respond to issues
addressed by the opposing side. Closing arguments are scheduled to
begin about two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft lawyer said he expects Judge  &LR; Jackson to hand down
a final ruling in December at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   At an American Bar Association gathering yesterday, Jackson said
he is determined avoid a Vietnam-like morass.
</P>
<P>
   As for which way the judge will rule, at this point, it's
anyone's guess. ``I don't think the court will have the political
will to break up Microsoft into separate pieces,'' said Tony
Picardi. ``But I think the court may mandate that the browser be
taken out of the (Windows) operating system.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ When Elizabeth Dole ventured into Iowa in
February, she was not greeted like another mere presidential
candidate but like a superstar. Television cameras trailed her
every move. In nearby Ames, she drew an unheard of outpouring: more
than 2,000 Iowans at one event, pressing to get close to the first
woman to wage a potent bid for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Dole had no organizational backbone to capitalize on
the enthusiasm. There were no campaign aides at the events to take
down the names of potential supporters, a fundamental organizing
tool in this state. There were no envelopes for people to send in
donations. And there was no follow up; weeks passed before Mrs.
Dole delivered a detailed policy speech or hired a finance director
to solicit contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Now the klieg lights have shifted. Mrs. Dole is no longer widely
viewed by the Republican establishment as the obvious alternative
should the front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, collapse.
Instead of being a star, she has faded into the chorus with the
other rivals to Bush, struggling to fight her way back. Monday, on
a return visit to Ames, Mrs. Dole drew 70 people at one event and
150 at another _ respectable but hardly record crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to boil down to a race between Bush and me,''
Mrs. Dole said in an interview. ``Every single poll has me beating
Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Brushing aside queries about her campaign's languid start, she
added forcefully: ``I'm not going to be distracted by anything, the
kinds of questions you're asking, because that doesn't distract me.
I'm running my effort. And they can run theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   There are numerous measures of how Mrs. Dole has lost ground:
Polls in the pivotal states of Iowa and New Hampshire show that
Mrs. Dole, who once registered a distant but unmistakable second
place to Bush, has slipped. Her fund-raising has been sluggish. She
has not captured many weighty endorsements. And Mrs. Dole's
endeavor to convince Republicans of her viability suffered a
further setback in May when her husband, Bob Dole, the party's
nominee in 1996, questioned in an interview whether Mrs. Dole would
even stay in the race.
</P>
<P>
   When Republican strategists are asked about the Dole campaign,
they invariably respond with two words: missed opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a lot of excitement early on but she was a little slow
to capitalize on it, so that when Bush got in he went from no
organization to a great one overnight,'' said Steve Duprey,
chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party. ``She had a real
opportunity from February to May before Bush got here. For some
reason it's taken her longer to get the organizational apparatus
cranked up. I think the level of interest, at least in New
Hampshire, initially overwhelmed them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is far too early to dismiss Mrs. Dole, a Harvard Law
School graduate who until recently was the president of the Red
Cross and is a former Secretary of Transportation and Secretary of
Labor. While Mrs. Dole is not the sensation she was months ago, she
still draws crowds teeming with intrigued women and young people
(and even some Democrats) to her appearances in tiny Iowa towns
like Coralville and Maquoketa. She has assembled state
organizations with aides who now take down the names of prospective
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole has begun to build a financial base by tapping into
support from women around the country. Forty-three percent of her
contributions have come from women; in all federal elections, women
account for roughly 25 percent. And her campaign recently signed up
22 women on her finance committee, each of whom agreed to raise
$10,000. (By the end of June she had raised $3.5 million, compared
with $36.3 million for Bush.)
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole, who is 63, has also become more comfortable on the
stump. She still likes to stick to a carefully choreographed
routine. But unlike in the early days of her campaign, Mrs. Dole
fields questions from voters and no longer dispatches aides to
shield her from the press.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a stunning move for a politician who has long found it
painful to talk to journalists, she even picked up the telephone to
call a New York Times reporter unsolicited. ``Is it OK if I visit
with you like this from time to time?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As her campaign bus rolled through the corn and soybean fields
of eastern Iowa the other day, with only one reporter in tow, Mrs.
Dole scoffed at the notion that she had let her candidacy languish.
She said Bush, whom she referred to as ``W,'' had been assembling
his campaign since 1996, and that every other Republican contender
except Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah got a head start because she did
not step down from the Red Cross until January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every other candidate except Hatch was at this some years ago,
including W.,'' Mrs. Dole said. ``I've only been out of the Red
Cross six months. We were starting so overnight that you don't just
have everything in place.''
</P>
<P>
   As the interview proceeded, Mrs. Dole departed from her usual
carefully parsed responses and dismissed any thought that she could
have geared up faster. ``Don't you think when this has been going
on just for six months that that's a rather unfair comment?'' she
said. ``Let's look at Bush. They've been at it for a long, long
time. You know that. Because there's no way they could have had $36
million if they hadn't been planning this for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounding increasingly defensive as she sought to draw a contrast
with Bush, Mrs. Dole asserted: ``The others have got to speak up
also. I think we have been specific. Would you agree to that?''
Wincing at a question about missed opportunities, she added, ``I'm
hearing the enthusiasm and the excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   She repeatedly cited polls showing that she could defeat _ or
wrestle to a dead heat _ Vice President Al Gore in a general
election.
</P>
<P>
   But the best gauge of whether Mrs. Dole can pull herself back
into her starting spot as the No. 2 contender will be at a straw
poll in Ames on Saturday. ``We are going to make history,'' she
tells crowds. ``This is important on the 14th.''
</P>
<P>
   The event is important because it will become clear whether Mrs.
Dole has developed the organizational strength and political appeal
to transform the excitement over her candidacy into commitment from
people (including many newcomers to politics) who are willing to
traipse to Ames to vote for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you can translate the interest into political support
is, I suppose, the fundamental question this campaign faces,'' said
Thomas A. Daffron, Mrs. Dole's campaign manager. ``We don't know
the answer to that yet. There isn't any history. There isn't any
barometer. There hasn't been a female candidate for president who
was serious.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 EBay Hires Gateway Tech Guru  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Online auctioneer eBay, plagued by a series of outages in recent
weeks, yesterday named a former Gateway executive to oversee
technical operations _ just hours after the latest snafu.
<P>
   Maynard Webb, 43, had been chief information officer at the No.2
direct seller of personal computers. As president of eBay
Technologies, he will report directly to eBay's chief executive,
Meg Whitman, and will coordinate the activities of the company's
newly hired chief technology officer and chief information officer.
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, eBay's system went kerblooey again Sunday night
for nearly three hours. Company spokesman Kevin Pursglove said the
site's credit-card-processing facilities went down at about 8 p.m.,
bringing most auctions to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   This snag followed a more severe outage Friday when hardware and
network problems conspired to knock eBay offline for about 10
hours, followed by several more hours of limited service.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock, which plunged more then 10 percent Friday,
fell another $3.63 yesterday, to $79.63.
</P>
<P>
   Pursglove said Webb was on hand Friday as eBay's engineers
scrambled to bring the site back online.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like he was ready to roll his sleeves up and jump
right in,'' Pursglove said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maynard's reputation in information technology is highly
regarded throughout the industry,'' Whitman said in a statement.
``We are confident that he possesses the vision and hands-on
experience to help ensure eBay's site stability moving forward and
to help scale eBay's system for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   One site-stabilizing factor will be eBay's new ``warm backup''
system, &UR;  &LR; intended to restore service within a couple of hours of a
system crash.
</P>
<P>
   While the warm backup would not have helped Friday without a
reliable network connection, Pursglove said he didn't know why the
system failed to kick in Sunday night. ``There's no explanation,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The warm backup was installed following a 21-hour outage in
June, causing eBay's stock to tumble 18 percent. It's now down more
than 60 percent since soaring to a high of $209.25 in April.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting to Webb &UR;  &LR; are former IBM executive Mark Ryan, the
company's new chief technology officer, and former Sun Microsystems
executive Bob Quinn, the chief information officer. Both were hired
since the June system failure.
</P>
<P>
   According to a company statement, the three are charged with
``taking eBay's system to the next level.'' In other words, it's
their job to make it work.

DES MOINES, Iowa: was serious.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though the idea of the first female president excites many
voters, it also injects some risk and uncertainty in the Republican
Party's headstrong quest to retake the White House. The uncertainty
placed immense pressure on Mrs. Dole to demonstrate _ and do so
early _ that hers was a campaign that could win. She has also had
to overcome the fact that Mrs. Dole has never been elected to
anything. So her initial organizational difficulties made some
Republicans even more apprehensive. While most Republicans say the
country is ready to elect a female president, a full third say it
is not, according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll taken in
March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'm ready for a woman,'' Barbara Beck, a
retired store manager, said after hearing Mrs. Dole speak recently
at a picnic near Laconia, N.H. ``I wonder if she'd be strong
enough. I just don't know if a woman could keep it together. She's
too cutsey. I want some desk slammer. I want someone to holler a
little.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole said she has never encountered such remarks. ``I'm
hearing from women who will say to me, `I've driven my daughter
halfway across this state to shake your hand!''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating her campaign is that Mrs. Dole herself seems
conflicted over how much to emphasize her sex. She implores
audiences to help her ``make history.'' But out of concern that she
not be seen as waging a narrow campaign based only on gender, she
later sought to play down that line, saying in an interview: ``I
don't want people to vote for me because I'm a woman. I want them
to vote for me because they feel I'm the best qualified.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Republican strategists argue that Mrs. Dole missed yet
another opportunity by keeping a low profile, refusing to appear on
national interview programs to take advantage of her sex and her
star quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her calculation is that there's sufficient time to do it in
the fall,'' said Ari Fleischer, Mrs. Dole's communications
director. Asked if that was his calculation as well, he said: ``I'm
a press guy. You can never do too much. But I accept this.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by interviews with dozens of Republicans at Mrs. Dole's
events in Iowa and New Hampshire, she has an uphill battle to
convince even her admirers that she can take off.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's always impressed me as dynamic _ she'd make a great
leader,'' Christine Gerling Cole, 44, an information specialist
from Davenport, Iowa, said after a Dole event. Asked if Mrs. Dole
will win the nomination, she said, ``My gut feeling is that she has
a good chance at the vice presidency. My gut is that the country is
not ready for a woman president. Maybe I'm wrong. I hope I am.''
</P>
<P>
   John Stevens, 80, a lawyer from Muscatine, Iowa, put it this
way: ``She gives all the right answers _ she's got a thick record
of accomplishments.''
</P>
<P>
   But asked if she can win the nomination, he said flatly, ``No.
I'm afraid that Bush has got too much money already. That's the
problem. And if I think he's got the best shot, I would vote for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a standard speech she delivers almost word-for-word from
memory, Mrs. Dole recites her vast executive experience and laments
what she says is ``a deficit in our basic American values.'' She
has proposed a crusade against illegal drug use and describes
improving public schools as a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Dole has done little to distinguish herself from Bush's
friendly faced conservatism. She drew the most attention when she
broke from the pack and called for prohibiting concealed weapons
and supporting child proof trigger locks.
</P>
<P>
   ``She should have taken advantage of the early attention to lay
out some of her stands on taxes and welfare and crime,'' said Ed
Gillepsie, who ran the campaign of Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, who
withdrew from the race last month. ``I'm still not sure you could
identify one striking policy or substantive aspect of the Dole
campaign right now apart from the tack on guns.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A big part of Mrs. Dole's woes may be beyond her control: she is
simply swamped by Bush. On June 30, Mrs. Dole consented to a rare
national television interview on the NBC ``Today'' program to put
forth the message that there would be no turning back from her
quest for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Dole's appearance was only an asterisk because hours
later, Bush announced his $36-million war chest. From that day
forward, press calls to the Dole headquarters outside Washington
have declined dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press followed the money and gave much less consideration
to anything else,'' Fleischer said. ``It's not that Elizabeth Dole
went down; it's that George Bush went up.''

 Pacific Exchange's Big Change  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The Pacific Exchange is preparing to shift from a membership
organization to a publicly owned, for-profit business, in the most
radical change in its structure in its 117-year history.
<P>
   Last month, the exchange's board of governors approved such a
plan for its money-losing stock exchange, the smaller of its two
operations. Pacific insiders said the proposal could pave the way
for a similar reorganization of its much larger and highly
lucrative options exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be the first step,`` said board member Sam
Terner. ``If this is successful, then we would like to (do the same
with) options and maybe take the whole thing public.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacific's move comes as stock and options exchanges around the
world come to grips with the unprecedented challenge posed by new
breeds of computerized trading systems linking buyers and sellers
directly, bypassing traditional trading floors and middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the loss of market share to computer-based trading
systems, the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market,
the two biggest stock trading organizations in the United States,
have both unveiled plans to junk their membership structures and
reorganize as profit-seeking corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Market experts say membership organizations aren't nimble enough
to compete, given the frantic pace of change in securities markets.
</P>
<P>
   Converting to for-profit status and selling shares to the public
would provide exchanges with a hoard of cash. Structuring as a
corporation rather than as an association would also let an
exchange be quick on its feet and not have to have important
matters approved by members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exchanges are saying `Let's get away from our members,'
who have vested interests in the status quo,'' said Junius W.
Peake, a finance professor at the University of Northern Colorado.
``Membership-dominated exchanges are an endangered species.``
</P>
<P>
   Pacific has more than 550 members who own exchange seats
entitling them to trade both stocks and stock options. Only about
72 of those seats are used for trading stock.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco bourse is the nation's third-largest options
exchange, but it is an also-ran in the stock exchange business.
</P>
<P>
   Under its reorganization plan, exchange members would no longer
automatically be able to trade stock. Instead, anyone, whether a
seat owner or not, would have to buy a license for a fee of $2,000
a month to trade stock.
</P>
<P>
   If its approved by members and the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the new system would be phased in over a nine-month
period beginning before year end.
</P>
<P>
   Exchange seats, which sell for about $450,000 each, would still
entitle owners to trade options. Eventually, though, Pacific will
probably junk the membership system for options, too, insiders
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific's stock operation, like those of other regional
exchanges, has been in decline for years, as the New York exchange
and Nasdaq grabbed the lion's share of the business.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, when Pacific planned to merge with the Chicago Board
Options Exchange, the exchange crafted a plan to sell or spin off
stock trading. When the merger collapsed, Pacific took steps to
make stock trading profitable again, such as planning to shut
costly trading floors in Los Angeles and San Francisco and have
floor brokers set up shop in their own offices.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new reorganization plan, Pacific would subsidize its
stock-trading subsidiary for 18 months, at the end of which it
would sell, spin off or liquidate if it fails to make money.

 MONEYBAG/ARTHUR M. LOUIS  &HT;     Investor Didn't Lose Out In Spin-Off 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: I purchased some Barnes &AMP; Noble stock several months ago, hoping
to capture some of the value from their online book sales. But in
May, they spun off the online operation _ Barnesandnoble.com _ in
an initial public offering, and I was left with the
bricks-and-mortar piece, whose stock price tanked. Is this legal?
Was I extremely naive? I am still in shock.
<P>
   A: It's not as bad as you think.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble (the bricks-and-mortar version) spun off only
about 18 percent of the shares of Barnesandnoble.com. It still
holds 41 percent, while the remaining 41 percent is owned by its
partner in the online venture _ the German book retailer
Bertelsmann.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that Barnes &AMP; Noble stock has skidded about 20 percent
since the company spun off Barnesandnoble.com. But as a shareholder
of Barnes &AMP; Noble, you participate indirectly in the stock
performance of Barnesandnoble.com because of the parent company's
continued stake in the online operation. It is reflected in the
price of your Barnes &AMP; Noble shares.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, your company received about $225 million in cash as
its portion of the IPO proceeds. If management knows what it is
doing, that money will be used to enhance the profitability of the
present assets and perhaps to acquire additional assets.
</P>
<P>
   I should point out that there is no law that required you to
keep your Barnes &AMP; Noble stock after the company announced its
plans for a Barnesandnoble.com spin-off. You could have sold your
stock then and there, and later invested the proceeds in
Barnesandnoble.com. Because the online operation is what attracted
you in the first place, that might have been your most appropriate
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that your company didn't gut itself. It got
fair value _ or something close to it _ for the assets it sold.
That's the way most publicly held companies behave. If they didn't,
they would have the regulators and their institutional shareholders
on their heads in no time.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Buying Vanguard Fund
</P>
<P>
   Q: You recently wrote about index funds and, in particular,
about the Vanguard Index Trust 500 fund, whose performance is
designed to track the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index. How do I invest
in that fund? Also, is it good only for a long-term-retirement type
of investment, as distinguished from money I might need before
retirement?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you are interested in buying shares in the fund, write to
the Vanguard Financial Center, P.O. Box 2600, Valley Forge, PA
19482. Or call toll-free at (800) 662-7447. Ask for a fund
prospectus and for any other fund literature they have available.
</P>
<P>
   As to how good an investment it is, that will hinge on the
future performance of the S&AMP;P 500 index, which is unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   The index is made up of the largest publicly held companies in
the United States. That sounds good on the surface, though some
experts say that the S&AMP;P 500 has become overpriced in recent years
and that it is due for a correction.
</P>
<P>
   The index has had its good years and its bad during its
seven-decade existence _ though it hasn't actually declined since
1990. In recent years, the passively managed Vanguard fund steadily
has outperformed the great majority of managed funds.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is no guarantee that this will continue to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   As to whether this should be a long-term investment: ideally,
yes. The stock market's long-term performance is far more reliable
than its short-term performance. You are taking a modest risk if
you invest money in the stock market that you need in five years.
If you need it in two years or less, the risk is substantial.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
How to Get In on IPOs
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been hearing a lot about initial public offerings and
was wondering: How can I buy shares in an IPO?
</P>
<P>
   A: Several years ago, I would have advised you to become rich
and befriend an investment banker. IPOs used to be strictly elite
affairs for people who gave plenty of brokerage and other business
to Wall Street firms.
</P>
<P>
   While that still is largely true, the IPO process has become a
bit more democratic in the past couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Retail customers of such brokerage firms as Charles Schwab,
Fidelity Investments, E-Trade and Wit Capital can get limited
amounts of IPO shares underwritten by such high-powered investment
bankers as BancBoston Robertson Stephens, Credit Suisse First
Boston, Goldman Sachs, Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, Lehman Brothers, J.P.
Morgan Securities and Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Another investment banker that offers IPOs to the general public
is W.R. Hambrecht &AMP; Co. However, it offers them through a so-called
Dutch auction bidding process _ called an ``Open IPO'' _ which
results in an offering price close to the stock's intrinsic market
value. As a result, the Open IPOs don't make huge price gains on
the first day, as usually happens with conventional IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you are attracted to IPOs in hopes of a first-day
bonanza, forget about Open IPOs.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Shielding Your Portfolio From Y2K Losses  &HT;     By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
With less than five months remaining until the end of the year, it
is time for investors to think about ways to protect their
portfolios from a potential Year 2000 stock-market disaster.
<P>
   Not that a disaster necessarily will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Experts have been working full steam to purge the world's
computer systems of all the errant chips and software that might
think 2000 is 1900. If the effort falls short, commerce _ or much
of it _ could grind to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   However, most computer people and economists contend that there
is no longer any need to fear a Y2K meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   They say the widely discussed doomsday scenario _ replete with
massive power failures, transportation breakdowns, bank and
brokerage collapses, looting, food riots _ is a product of
ill-informed, overwrought minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the probabilities are very high that on Jan. 1, 2000,
nothing very unusual is going to happen,'' declared Robert T.
Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, in a
recent speech. Regulators and executives in virtually all
industries have made strong progress toward Y2K compliance, he
observed.
</P>
<P>
   But he also conceded that ``probabilities aren't certainties.''
</P>
<P>
   Market watchers old enough to remember back more than five years
know that stocks can plummet 30 or 40 percent in a short time.
Trade deficits, oil shocks and inflationary spirals have inflicted
severe damage on the market in decades past.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K doomsday scenario _ if it becomes a reality _ could do
the same.
</P>
<P>
   So, how does someone who owns stocks or mutual funds prepare for
it?
</P>
<P>
   You can choose from three plausible strategies:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_You can take the long-term view and do nothing, on the premise
that the stock market always recovers (eventually) from even the
steepest declines. If you have a solid blue-chip portfolio, that
could be the right choice.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_You can sell at least some of your stocks or fund shares and hold
the cash to reinvest next year, after the dust settles. The most
likely candidates for sale might include foreign securities or U.S.
companies with a heavy foreign presence, because Y2K compliance is
lagging overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. is clearly the leader in Y2K compliance,'' observes
Chris Hill, a spokesman for the Motley Fool online investment site.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_You can, in effect, insure your portfolio against a calamitous
drop by buying put options on individual stocks and stock market
indexes.
</P>
<P>
   Not many experts expect Y2K to cause a market crash _ or at
least not many will admit it. On the other hand, no one absolutely
will dismiss the possibility, because no one knows for certain
where the Y2K glitch still lurks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall impact on the U.S. economy is going to be fairly
limited,'' says Gary Schlossberg, an economist with Wells Capital
Management in San Francisco. ``It should be perceptible but
containable _ not a major disruption.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
INTERNATIONAL CONCERNS
</P>
<P>
   But he adds: ``The biggest question mark is how does the
international scene affect us? The extent to which preparations
have been made overseas is a big question mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlossberg offers this ray of hope: ``The industries that are
most exposed overseas and those here, like banks, which deal with
an array of industries in their lending decisions, are the
industries that took the greatest precautions and are furthest
along.''
</P>
<P>
   He concludes: ``Industries will recover as any problems are
dealt with. Individual investors should be encouraged to take the
longer view, as they should in every facet of their investment
decisions. They should be investing with a long-term strategy. If
they have a good long-term portfolio, they should leave it alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Salamone, director of trading with the Investment Research
Institute in Cincinnati, argues that the stock market ``is a
discounting mechanism'' and that what may happen after the turn of
the year already should be reflected in current stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   However, he acknowledges that the market obviously is not
discounting ``catastrophes, such as planes falling out of the sky _
the worst sort of scenarios.''
</P>
<P>
   Could the market's recent slump _ with the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index down more than 7 percent from the high reached on July 16 _
reflect fears about Y2K?
</P>
<P>
   Salamone says it is more likely that the market mainly is
discounting expected increases in interest rates in the wake of
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's repeated warnings about
inflation. ``The market's biggest challenge is the Fed as we go
forward,'' he contends.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Acuff, a market strategist with Salomon Smith Barney in
New York, says he isn't sure that Y2K will be ``the end of the
world'' or even ``a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But he says investors might want ``some liquidity to take
advantage of any pullback in the market _ if there is such. I would
take money out of lesser-quality securities that may have performed
poorly already.''
</P>
<P>
   However, investors don't necessarily have to sell securities to
protect their holdings. They can do it instead by purchasing put
options, which can be used to offset declines in many hundreds of
individual stocks or in a broad assortment of indexes.
</P>
<P>
   Put options give you the right to sell a stock or index at a
fixed price before a fixed deadline. They, therefore, rise in value
as prices fall.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy them on various options exchanges from other
investors or from brokerage firms that make a market in options.
</P>
<P>
   The latest option prices can be found in such
investment-oriented newspapers as the Wall Street Journal, and
during trading hours, they can be tracked on market-quote machines
or on brokerage firm Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HOW PUT OPTIONS WORK
</P>
<P>
   Put options are the opposite of call options, which give you the
right to buy securities at a fixed price before a fixed deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Most investors consider options too speculative or mysterious to
mess with. But they can be understood, if not mastered, with a few
hours of study.
</P>
<P>
   Options can be bought through just about any broker, offline or
online.
</P>
<P>
   However, because they are indeed speculative _ it is common for
investors to lose all the money they pay for an option _ your
broker might refuse to let you buy them if your financial resources
seem too limited.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem with options, apart from the speculative
danger, is that they can be expensive. If you buy put options in
anticipation of a market meltdown and the market goes up instead,
you will have wasted a significant portion of your assets.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this, you have to think of put options as similar to
medical insurance: You pay the premium, but maybe you don't get
sick. But that's OK, too _ right?
</P>
<P>
   Each put option corresponds to 100 shares of an individual
stock, or to 100 times the value of a stock index.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, for example, Coca-Cola stock was selling for
$60.88 per share _ $6,087.50 for a 100-share lot. At the same time,
a put option allowing you to sell 100 shares of Coke at $60 per
share before next February 19 could be bought for $450.
</P>
<P>
   That $450 premium amounted to more than 7 percent of the value
of the 100 Coke shares _ a stiff price to pay for six months' worth
of insurance. But if Y2K were to send Coke's price tumbling below
$55.50 per share by February, the price you paid for the put option
would be justified because its value would rise above $450.
</P>
<P>
   If the stock fell to $50 per share, for example, you would lose
$1,087.50 in market value on the stock, but your loss would be
partly offset by a $550 gain in the value of the put option. The 18
percent decline in the stock price would translate to only a 9
percent decline for you because you were protected by the put.
</P>
<P>
   Why, you may ask, shouldn't a worried investor simply sell a
stock that seems worrisome rather than fooling around with put
options?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that once you sell the stock, you lose your chance
to profit if the price surprises you and goes higher. The neat
thing about a put option is that if you are wrong and the stock
remains strong, you still own the stock.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GOOD FOR INDEXES
</P>
<P>
   It usually is more cost-efficient to buy put options on an index
rather than individual stocks _ assuming that you expect the market
in general to tank. Index options tend to be more reasonably
priced, and you don't have to pay multiple commissions.
</P>
<P>
   However, it doesn't make sense for people with small portfolios
to protect them with index options because indexes are much
higher-priced than most stocks.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was priced late
last week at 1,313.71, which means that a single S&AMP;P 500 put option
would protect a portfolio with assets of 100 times that much, or
$131,371.
</P>
<P>
   A put option allowing you to sell the index at 1,200 before next
March 18 was selling at a hefty $6,375, or nearly 5 percent of the
$131,371 total.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, to make things simple, that your portfolio is worth
exactly $131,371, and that its performance exactly tracks the S&AMP;P
500.
</P>
<P>
   If the S&AMP;P 500 were to plunge 30 percent below last week's
level, the value of your put would rise to $28,040 _ nearly $22,000
above your purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   The net result is that a 30 percent drop in the market would
result in only a 14 percent drop in the value of your portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Happy New Year.

 &HT;    Browns, backers are back
 &HT;    (ATTENTION: Ohio editors.)
 &HT;    By Christine Vasconez and Bob Batz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ High-fives, chants and cheers overtook the once
tearful, grimacing faces of Cleveland Browns fans Monday night as
the ``new'' team played the Dallas Cowboys in Canton.
</P>
<P>
   Fans packed bars like Damon's in Kettering to celebrate the
Browns comeback as an expansion team, after it left Ohio for
Maryland, where the team is now called the Baltimore Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's truly a momentous occasion,'' said Eric Gayheart about
the exhibition game. ``It's been three years since they've played.
It's nice to see them on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the Browns are back, it's a beautiful time,'' said
Gayheart, who sat across the table from his foe, a Cowboy fan.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Hamilton, a fan for almost 30 years, said, ``to me this
first game is a rebirth, part of history like Neil Armstrong's
first step on the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Many die-hard Browns fans mourned the team leaving Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was crying a lot and I didn't watch football for awhile,''
said Hamilton, who brought his 11-year-old daughter to Damon's. ``I
think every fan said you may take the team, but not the name or
colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Gayheart, who was converted from a Bengals fan to a Browns fan
in the early '80s by his uncle, said ``it's like a part of you was
taken away. I felt something missing.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other backers never let their love for the Browns die.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd come out to a big atmosphere to grab the game,''
said Jesse Showalter, who wore a replica of quarterback Tim Couch's
No.2 jersey. ``It's been three long years since I've been able to
root for a team and the day has finally come.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Ohio's card-carrying Browns Backers had their own
predictions about the season as they planted themselves in front of
television sets in their respective communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, I didn't even want to attend Monday's
game because I really felt it was a night to be with other members
of my chapter,'' said Piqua's Greg Foutz, 48, president of the
1,100-member Miami Valley Browns Backers Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Browns Backers is one of the largest sports-oriented fan clubs
in the nation. Of the dozens of BB chapters scattered about Ohio,
the Piqua-based branch is the largest.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate Dayton area has at least two chapters _ the
Greater Dayton Browns Backers and the Northwest Browns Backers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Foutz and his cronies were divided into two camps to
catch the televised game.
</P>
<P>
   Some were decked out in orange and brown caps, shirts and
what-have-you at the End Zone Lounge in Covington.
</P>
<P>
   Others huddled around TVs at Slammer's Nightclub Inc. in
Versailles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so big, we can't all fit into one bar any more,'' Foutz
explained.

OOPS BALL, AS PLAYED BY CHECKETTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just when we appeared to be experiencing a summer
free of Knicks conspiracy, here comes the news that Dave Checketts
has apparently been at it again. Exploring his options, trying to
make another impact hire, without consulting us first.
</P>
<P>
   I'm actually half-serious about this. It was reported Monday in
Salt Lake City and later confirmed that Checketts has reached back
to his Utah roots in an attempt to hire Scott Layden to run the
basketball operations at Madison Square Garden. That's what
Checketts gets paid to do, but something was obviously missing
here. It's called a news release, and it should have been handed
out weeks ago, and this is what it could have said:
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York Knicks are in the process of seeking a new
director of basketball operations and are considering several
candidates, including Ed Tapscott, who is currently holding the
position on an interim basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a period of relative calm that included a reported
extension of Coach Jeff Van Gundy's contract created the false
public impression that Tapscott would soon officially be named
Ernie Grunfeld's successor, when Checketts returned from vacation.
Tapscott worked the college draft and just the other day signed
John Wallace as a free agent. Then came Monday's Layden report and,
once again, the operative word for the way Checketts has gone about
his business was ``oops.''
</P>
<P>
   Checketts never owed Tapscott the job, though it sure would be a
welcome change in the way most professional sports teams operate if
an African-American assistant like Tapscott could occasionally
inherit a big job the way white men so often do. It's always useful
to remember that Van Gundy had never been a head coach anywhere
important when he was given the Knicks job. Grunfeld was Al
Bianchi's right-hand man _ the way Tapscott was his _ when he was
promoted back in the Pat Riley days. Riley himself was a washed-up
jock, a coaching nobody, when the Lakers' owner, Jerry Buss, handed
him the best team in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Tapscott, a lawyer, college coach and onetime player agent, has
more than enough credentials and experience in the Knicks'
organization to be given the shot. At the very least, no matter who
winds up with the job, Checketts comes off as strangely oblivious
to a sensitive issue, when you would have thought he'd have known
better.
</P>
<P>
   For years around these parts, Checketts has had the reputation
as something of a public relations authority, a real smoothie, but
that unflappable exterior cracked during the cloak-and-dagger Phil
Jackson affair last spring. It wasn't Checketts' pursuit of Jackson
that was ill advised; it was the sloppy Nixonian cover-up. Contract
extension notwithstanding, you wonder if Van Gundy will ever truly
trust Checketts or work harmoniously with him.
</P>
<P>
   I'm guessing here, or playing amateur psychologist, but that has
to be why Checketts has been out West, trying to persuade Layden to
return to his own eastern roots in New York. Checketts has a
personal agenda, the need for a trustworthy organizational ally,
one of ``his guys'' completely in charge. Tapscott was hired by
Grunfeld, who was fed his last supper by Checketts just before the
Knicks turned their season around. Van Gundy, meanwhile, was hung
out so badly during the playoffs that he needed his father to come
down to the Garden one Sunday afternoon to give him a hug.
</P>
<P>
   Layden is highly respected, at 42 a young veteran who has kept
the Jazz in contention as the core of the team has aged. Then
again, Karl Malone and John Stockton were already on the Utah
roster when Layden took over 11 years ago, seven years after he
joined the Jazz, then coached by his father, Frank. Layden has also
worked his entire career in an organization which is the Knicks'
polar opposite. In Utah, the team president doesn't become a
corporate sacrifice and cheap motivational tool in the final
desperation lap of a disappointing season. Layden, I would imagine,
was likely getting an earful on that very subject when he was
meeting with his Utah superiors late into the day.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the result, it's nice to know we will have the Knicks
to liven things up around here before long, with their own special
brand of family dysfunction. Van Gundy has now been reminded that
while he won himself a huge contract, he'd better mind his X's and
O's. Tapscott has got a lesson in the social pitfalls of corporate
climbing. Just when people began to speculate that the Knicks were
finally all on the same page, moving forward after the finals, here
came the news that Checketts still wanted to shake up the mix,
bring another slice of Utah to New York.

<P>
   Victor Mature, who attained movie stardom dressed in a wooly
mammoth loincloth, died on Wednesday in San Diego County, Calif. He
was 86, according to the Motion Picture Almanac, although other
references have put him at 83 or 84.
</P>
<P>
   He died of cancer, said Zollie Volchok, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Bare-chested and bare-armed, Mature in his long career in
Hollywood sported a variety of loincloths, togas and leotards _ as
the prehistoric hunter, Tumak, in the movie that made him a star in
1940, ``One Million B.C.''; as the Greek slave, Demetrius, who
became a fervent Christian in ``The Robe'' (1953) and who later
demonstrated muscular Christianity in ``Demetrius and the
Gladiators'' (1954); as the dashing lion killer in ``The Egyptian''
(1954); and as the long- haired Samson who succumbed to the wiles
of Hedy Lamarr in Cecil B. DeMille's ``Samson and Delilah'' (1949).
</P>
<P>
   The word ``Beefcake'' may have been coined to define Mature's
broad shoulders, narrow waist, curly hair and sensual face crowned
by dazzling white teeth. In his first Broadway role, he played the
gorgeous movie star who wooed Gertrude Lawrence in the hit Broadway
musical ``Lady in the Dark'' (1941). His costumes included pink
circus tights topped by leopard skin briefs and he managed not to
be an anticlimax even after being described as ``the most beautiful
hunk of man you ever saw in your life'' before his arrival on
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Never an actor who took himself too seriously, Mature was fond
of telling the story of how he was rejected for membership in the
Los Angeles Country Club because the club did not accept actors. He
told a reporter that he had replied, ``Hell, I'm no actor, and I've
got 28 pictures and a scrapbook of reviews to prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, some of his reviews were good. Under the direction of
John Ford, he held his own against Henry Fonda's Wyatt Earp,
playing the dying Doc Holliday, the Eastern doctor turned
tubercular Western gambler in ``My Darling Clementine'' (1946). In
the movie he handled Hamlet's ``To Be or Not To Be'' soliloquy
without embarrassing himself or the audience.
</P>
<P>
   And in the film noir ``Kiss of Death'' (1947) he was widely
praised for his work as Nick Bianco, a small- time crook who wants
to go straight but who is menaced by Richard Widmark's giggling
psychopathic killer Tommy Udo. It was perhaps his best performance.
``Victor Mature gives an unexpectedly subdued, convincing
performance,'' Pauline Kael wrote. Time magazine said the actor
``apparently needed nothing all this time but the right kind of
role.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor Mature was set on his career path as a heartthrob in his
first film, ``The Housekeeper's Daughter'' (1939). He flashed on
the screen for less than five minutes playing the bit part of a
lovesick gangster; his appearance brought 20,000 fan letters and
won him the lead in ``One Million B.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Mature told Life magazine in 1941, ``I can act, but what I've
got that the others don't have is this,'' as he pointed to his
body. The same article described him as ``proportioned like a
frappe glass'' with a 33-inch waist, 25- inch biceps and a 45-inch
chest, and standing 6 feet 2 1/2 inches tall. Life added that 300
New York models had chosen him as the man they would most like to
be marooned with on a desert island.
</P>
<P>
   Mature, who was fond of ice cream and loathed exercise,
described himself to the Saturday Evening Post in 1942 as ``the
biggest fraud that ever hit Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   But he took full advantage of the physique that nature had
offered him. He made 55 movies, married five times, earned $18
million, invested wisely, and more or less retired at the age of 46
to play golf and eat. ``There's a lot to be said for loafing if you
know how to do it gracefully,'' he said in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   From 1940 to 1950, despite losing three years when he was in the
Coast Guard during World War II, Mature starred in 17 movies,
including, in 1942, ``Footlight Serenade'' and ``Song of the
Islands'' with Betty Grable, ``My Gal Sal'' with Rita Hayworth, and
``Seven Days Leave'' with Lucille Ball. From 1950 to 1960 he
churned out 30 films.
</P>
<P>
   Then, having prospered in commercial real estate and having been
prescient enough to open stores selling television sets the year
after television began, he departed to a manor house overlooking
the ninth hole at the Rancho Santa Fe Country Club, a two-hour
drive south of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Mature was born in Louisville, Ky., the son of an
Austrian scissors grinder who had married the local doctor's
daughter. Victor was one of the three children born to Marcellus
and Clara Mature.
</P>
<P>
   Unstudious and rebellious, he was thrown out of four schools,
including the Kentucky Military Institute. A classmate there, the
comedian Jim Backus, recalled the illegal cocktail parties of lemon
soda and Aqua Velva shaving lotion that they co-hosted, and said
Mature was known as ``Cadet Slob.'' Leaving school at 15, he became
a salesman with a wholesale candy house, then went out on his own
as a candy jobber.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later he packed his car with canned goods and candy
and headed to Hollywood, armed with the following advice from his
father, who had become a success in the refrigeration business:
``As long as people think you're dumber than you are, you'll make
money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Arrived here with eleven cents and an ambition. I am going to
become an actor,'' Mature said he telegraphed his father. His
father wired back: ``Forty-three years ago I arrived in New York
with five cents and could not even speak English. You are six cents
up on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Mature delighted in embroidering his life to intrigue
reporters, that story may have been apocryphal. But he did sleep
for several months in a tent in the back yard of Gilmore Brown, the
director of the Pasadena Playhouse. Told to study acting at the
Playhouse's drama school, he polished cars, walked dogs and waxed
floors to earn his tuition.
</P>
<P>
   He made his debut as an actor in ``Paths of Glory'' on November
16, 1936, and followed up with small roles in about sixty Playhouse
productions before earning a leading role in ``Autumn Crocus.''
Along the way he married and divorced Frances Evans, a member of
the acting company.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1939, the producer Hal Roach saw Mature as the
lead in the Pasadena Playhouse production of Ben Hecht's ``To Quito
and Back'' and signed him to play Lefty in ``The Housekeeper's
Daughter,'' which starred Joan Bennett. He had tenth billing. But
as the fan mail mounted, Roach put him under contract and cast him
in ``One Million B.C.'' opposite Carole Landis.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mature had a natural talent for self-promotion that was buffed
to perfection by his two roommates _ the editor of a fan magazine
and Hal Roach's press agent. Night after night he hit the
nightclubs, escorting a series of petite blonde stars _ Wendy
Barrie, Alice Faye, Betty Grable and Lana Turner among them _ who
made a striking contrast to his massive dark good looks. He gave
reporters his home telephone number and encouraged them to call at
any hour of the day or night.
</P>
<P>
   After RKO bought half of his contract and cast him opposite Anna
Neagle in ``No No Nanette'' (1940), he was off to New York.
Broadway producers ``all expected me to be a big sap,'' Mature
said. ``And then they all got excited when they saw I knew
something about acting.''
</P>
<P>
   When ``Lady in the Dark'' closed in June 1941, he married Martha
Stephenson Kemp, the widow of the band leader Hal Kemp, whom he had
met a few weeks earlier. They separated six months later.
</P>
<P>
   He was now a major star, earning $1,200 a week at 20th
Century-Fox, which had bought his contract from Hal Roach. After
co-starring with Betty Grable in the murder mystery ``I Wake Up
Screaming,'' he wore a burnoose as the languid Dr. Omar in the
bizarrely melodramatic ``The Shanghai Gesture,'' which was directed
by Josef von Sternberg. Then he enlisted in the Coast Guard and
spent 14 months during World War 11 as a chief boatswain's mate on
convoy duty in the North Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   While making ``My Gal Sal,'' he had fallen in love with Rita
Hayworth and planned to marry her after the war. When his ship
docked, he heard on the radio that she had married her magic show
partner, Orson Welles. He responded with a wisecrack: ``Apparently
the way to a woman's heart is to saw her in half.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, he was assigned to the Coast Guard's musical, ``Tars
and Spars,'' and found himself back on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   With his voluptuous face, and hooded, heavy lidded snake's eyes,
he had an overripe quality on screen that the critic David Thomson
called ``a barely concealed sexual advertisement.'' Few of his
movies were memorable. In endless early films, he played the wise
guy _ the slightly crooked promoter with too much brilliantine on
his impossibly thick and curly black hair.
</P>
<P>
   He was back in ancient Rome appearing opposite Jean Simmons in
``Androcles and the Lion'' (1952). Then he played an aging football
star in Jacques Tourneur's ``Easy Living'' (1949); a foreign-born
racketeer in ``Gambling House'' (1950); the American promoter who
discovered Australian swimming star Esther Williams in ``Million
Dollar Mermaid'' (1952), and the Sioux warrior in ``Chief Crazy
Horse'' (1955). As the years passed he appeared in movies with
names like ``The Sharkfighters'' and ``Timbuktu,'' playing an
assortment of intrepid adventurers, soldiers and heroic natives in
various countries and historical eras, including ``Hannibal''
(1960), in which he crossed the Alps with elephants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't pampered the way a Tyrone Power was,'' Mature said of
his 18 years under contract to Fox. ``Zanuck would say to
producers, `If you're not careful, I'll give you Mature for your
next picture.'''
</P>
<P>
   He married for a third time in 1948 and was divorced in 1955.
His fourth marriage, in 1959, to Adrienne Joy Urwick, also ended in
divorce. In 1972 he married for the fifth and last time. ``This one
has lasted longer than all the others put together,'' he quipped in
1988 of his marriage to Lorey Sabena, a former opera singer. He has
one daughter, Victoria. The Matures later divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Mature had always been quick-witted with an excellent sense of
timing, and he did not overstay his welcome in Hollywood. For most
of his career he had earned $5,000 a week and had still been frugal
enough to take half a dozen pairs of high-button shoes from
``Million Dollar Mermaid'' to convert into golf shoes. After ``The
Tartars'' (1962), an Italian spectacle graced by Orson Welles as
the leader of the barbarians, he turned his attention to playing 18
holes of golf six days a week.
</P>
<P>
   During the next two decades he occasionally turned his back on
golf for a spot of acting. In 1966, he went to Italy to do a wicked
parody of himself and earn the movie's loudest laughs as a matinee
idol in Vittorio De Sica's satirical farce, ``After the Fox.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor Mature was never adverse to kidding himself. In the 1968
movie, ``Head,'' he was the giant head, with the Monkees pop group
appearing as dandruff in his hair. He got some of the best reviews
of his career as the amiably vulgar Mafia bigshot Carmine Ganucci
in another farce, ``Every Little Crook and Nanny,'' in 1972. His
last performance was as Samson's father in a television remake of
``Samson and Delilah.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I took acting five times as seriously as anyone else,'' Mature
said in a 1971 interview. ``I just couldn't show it.''

HILLARY CLINTON STOPS OFF TO LISTEN TO BROOKLYNITES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After weeks of traveling throughout New York state,
Hillary Rodham Clinton's listening tour stopped Monday for the
first time in New York City, where she held a discussion about
education in a section of Brooklyn that is expected to be solidly
behind her all-but-announced campaign for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's 90-minute session took her to the Concord Baptist
Church, a landmark religious institution in the borough's Bedford
Stuyvesant section.
</P>
<P>
   She listened to a host of people offer criticisms and
observations about problems in inner-city education, from the need
for smaller class sizes and improved after-school programs to
dissatisfaction about the lack of foreign-language courses.
</P>
<P>
   The comments and questions were all polite, and some of the 250
participants _ the largest gathering to date on Mrs. Clinton's
listening tour _ were openly supportive of her anticipated
candidacy. When Mary Pinkett, a City Councilwoman from Brooklyn,
addressed Mrs. Clinton as ``Senator-to-be Clinton,'' the entire
room erupted in applause.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton seemed intent on blunting criticism from some
politicians that, while traveling from Binghamton to Elmira to
Rochester in recent weeks, she had ignored traditionally Democratic
strongholds in New York City, particularly in black and Hispanic
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Mrs. Clinton's appearance in Brooklyn, the Rev. Al
Sharpton continued his criticism of her by complaining that she had
not yet met with a number of black and Hispanic politicians and
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she meets with everyone all over the state and has not
met with a David Dinkins or Al Sharpton, the message she is sending
to the black and Latino community, the largest and most consistent
Democratic voters, is very much of concern to me.'' He added, ``I
think some of that public complaint is what led her to go to
Brooklyn.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Clinton won strong praise from the Democratic Party
officials who met with her Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very interested in the issues affecting people here,''
said Angel Rodriguez, a City Councilman from the Sunset Park
section of Brooklyn. ``I felt she was listening to what we were
saying. That's not what you get from the current administration.
Giuliani doesn't listen,'' he said, referring to Mrs. Clinton's
potential Republican opponent, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton spent much of her day immersed in activities that
candidates typically undertake to lay the foundation of a campaign.
She held a private meeting at a Brooklyn hotel with about 40
prominent Democrats from the city and state.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the people who are the real political infrastructure
of the Democratic Party,'' said Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr.,
the Brooklyn Democratic Party chairman. ``They all clearly
indicated enthusiastically that we're going to collectively be
behind the first lady if she decides to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Mrs. Clinton attended a $1,000-a-person reception
that was expected to raise $100,000 for her campaign exploratory
committee. The reception was held at the Manhattan home of Patricia
Kenner, the owner of a bus company, her aides said.

 &HT;    Braves triumph in eighth, beat Astros 5-3
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Braves needed to be resourceful with the NL
Central-leading Astros in town for the first of a three-game series
and the Mets a half-game in first place in the East going into
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz was just the man for the job.
</P>
<P>
   In his never-ending search for a way to throw with less elbow
pain, he dropped down and threw some pitches from the side. The
ploy helped limit the Astros to two runs despite 11 hits, and the
Braves' lineup proved resourceful enough in the late innings to
beat the Astros 5-3. The winning hit was a two-run single by
Pascual Matos in the eigthth after he just missed a home run.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had won only one of Smoltz's previous six starts,
three of them as he was heading back onto the disabled list, four
on his way off. Now comes the hard part with Shane Reynolds and
Jose Lima to contend with the next two days. They have combined for
29 wins and given the Astros' starting rotation two big reasons to
lead the majors with a 3.79 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Twice the Braves came back from one-run down, first on a two-out
Ryan Klesko liner past Jeff Bagwell in the third inning and the
second on a total team effort in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Back-to-back singles by Greg Myers and Jose Hernandez started it
off, and a sacrifice by Ozzie Guillen got them into scoring
position. Gerald Williams tied it at 2 with a sacrifice fly to
center, and after Keith Lockhart drew a walk, Chipper Jones drove
in the go-ahead run by singling softly to left.
</P>
<P>
   That was the end of the night for Chris Holt, who added some
more hard luck to his season. Holt entered the game with a 2-11
record, with the Astros scoring only 3.1 runs per game in those 11
losses. He wasn't even that fortunate Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz dropped down to mix in some low 90s fastballs from a new
angle with his over the top fastball in the mid 90s.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz gave up 11 hits, 10 of them singles, but the Astros
managed runs off him only on a Carl Everett single up the middle in
the third inning and a looping two-out, two-strike single by Tim
Bogar in the sixth inning. Smoltz got out of a first-and-third jam
in the seventh by striking out Jeff Bagwell and coaxing a double
play out of Derek Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones left some spike imprints in the center-field wall
as he robbed Bill Spiers of extra bases in the third inning. Jones
sprinted back toward the 400 mark, then sprung up and cradled the
ball in his glove just before hitting the wall.

4 COMPANIES AGREE TO MONITORING OF MARIANAS PLANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four major retailers Monday settled claims brought against them
in a class-action suit that amounted to the biggest legal challenge
ever posed against sweatshops on American soil.
</P>
<P>
   The retailers _ Nordstrom, Gymboree, Cutter &AMP; Buck and J. Crew,
a subsidiary of the Texas Pacific Group _ agreed to require
independent monitoring for compliance with basic minimum labor
standards at the factories they use in the Northern Marianas, a
U.S. commonwealth in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The four companies were among 18 American retailers and apparel
manufacturers accused in the lawsuit of conspiring with Marianas
factory owners to deprive 15,000 apparel workers of their basic
rights and to keep many of them in involuntary servitude, all with
the aim of holding down production costs.
</P>
<P>
   Another four retailers that Albert Meyerhoff, the chief lawyer
for the plaintiffs, had threatened to add as defendants said Monday
that they had agreed in principle to settle as well. Like the first
four, these retailers _ Polo/Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan
International, Phillips-Van Heusen and Chadwick's of Boston _
pledged to require independent monitoring of Marianas factories and
to help finance such monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, seeking more than $1 billion in damages, was filed
in January on behalf of a potential class of 50,000 workers and
former workers, most of them on the Marianas' largest island,
Saipan, a booming site for garment manufacturers who ship to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Among the remaining defendants are the Gap, Tommy Hilfiger and
Wal-Mart, all of which deny wrongdoing and say they already have
strict codes of conduct for their contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Under the accord reached Monday, which requires the approval of
the Federal District Court in Los Angeles, the four settling
retailers pledged to pay a total of $1.25 million for monitoring
Marianas factories and to require that those factories honor basic
rights like overtime pay and safe food and water.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement establishes a monitoring program with teeth,''
said Lora Jo Foo, president of Sweatshop Watch, a labor rights
group. ``It will make a difference in the lives of thousands of
Saipan garment workers.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit charged that many of the workers, for the most part
citizens of China, had promised recruiters up to $10,000 each to
transport them to Saipan, where, the suit maintained, they worked
in indentured servitude to pay those fees. In the settlement, the
four companies pledged not to use factories that employ workers who
have paid recruitment fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The settlement uses the economic leverage of these prestigious
American retailers to influence the labor practices of these
foreign-owned factories,'' Meyerhoff said. ``We must ask ourselves,
`If this agreement is good enough for Ralph Lauren and Nordstrom,
why isn't it good enough for Tommy Hilfiger or Wal-Mart?'''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement calls for a respected nonprofit monitoring
organization, Verite, based in Amherst, Mass., to inspect the
Marianas factories. This monitoring will include unannounced
factory visits and investigation of complaints by workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A long, drawn-out battle didn't make good sense to us even
though we remain confident about our ability to successfully defend
ourselves,'' said Erik Nordstrom, Nordstrom's co-president. ``We
feel these resources are better spent elsewhere and could be used
toward making a good-faith effort to furthering our commitment to
using vendors who comply with the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutter &AMP; Buck also issued a statement, saying that it was
confident it would have prevailed in the lawsuit but that it
thought it should put the matter behind it in a way that would help
improve the working environment at the factories it uses.

FORMER MAGAZINE EDITOR EXPECTED TO DUST OFF ARMANI'S IMAGE

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A couple of months ago, Matthias Vriens, the editor in chief of
Dutch, the avant-garde fashion magazine, was talking about moving
it from Paris to New York, where it might draw on the same artistic
vitality that already has attracted European designers like Helmut
Lang and Alexander McQueen.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the plug has been pulled on that possibility, because last
week it was announced that Vriens would be moving to Milan to
become creative director of Giorgio Armani.
</P>
<P>
   What can this mean to Armani, the successful but aging fashion
house, which will celebrate its 25th anniversary next year?
Probably a lot, to judge from Armani's choice of a farsighted
editor whose magazine represents the vanguard in fashion and
photography.
</P>
<P>
   At Dutch, Vriens, 36, sought out new photographers and typically
devoted an entire issue to a single theme, like the influence of
Yves Saint Laurent. A modest man with a sly sense of humor, Vriens
has been known to take relatively banal ideas, like publishing
childhood snapshots of designers opposite current images of
themselves or their work, and create strangely meaningful effects.
At Armani, he will surely have an impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like making a magazine, I'll be working with visuals for
Mr. Armani,'' said Vriens, who will oversee advertising campaigns,
packaging design and retail merchandising. ``It's the same job, but
from the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Armani built his reputation on soft-tailored sportswear
_ and still commands the respect of retailers because a
significantly high percentage of his clothes sell at full price _
the designer has lost ground in less tangible ways.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five or six years, companies like Gucci and Prada
have evolved into marketing powerhouses, and while much of their
business comes from nonapparel items like shoes and handbags, they
have used advertising and sensational runway shows to exploit their
fashion reputations.
</P>
<P>
   Armani, by contrast, has seemed almost stubbornly to refuse to
play this modern shill game, a natural response perhaps from an
$840 million company with six labels, more than 200 stores and a
slew of licenses, all more or less controlled by a single
individual.
</P>
<P>
   But Armani is changing, in a fashion. Three months ago, he hired
Andrew Grossman, an experienced American retailing executive, as
chief operating officer of the company's American subsidiary. At
the same time, Robert Triefus was put in charge of corporate
communications.
</P>
<P>
   It was Triefus, formerly with Calvin Klein, who helped compose a
short list of candidates for creative director, a new position now
filled by Vriens.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that Armani has heard rumblings from the fashion
press that his image has not moved forward, Triefus said the latest
changes came from the designer himself. ``He wants to feel that,
aside from design, the company is communicating in a modern way,''
Triefus said.
</P>
<P>
   Vriens, who is known as Matty, will have his work cut out for
him. Aside from giving Armani's advertising a fresh look, he will
be involved with the spring runway shows in Milan, which will take
place not in Armani's palazzo, now thoroughly familiar to the
fashion press, but in a new location. Next year, the company will
introduce cosmetics and home furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   Vriens, who is Dutch and, for now, converses with Armani in
French, said they share an affinity for photography and film.
Recalling their first meeting, when Armani was perusing a copy of
Dutch (which, just to confuse matters, is published in English),
Vriens said the designer told him, ``You have a strong point of
view.''
</P>
<P>
   But this doesn't mean that Armani can't teach an editor a few
tricks. When Vriens recently pitched an idea, he said Armani calmly
told him he had already tried it and then reminded him, ``So we
need to move on, Matty.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jack Rosenthal, an assistant managing editor of The
New York Times, was named Monday to succeed Arthur Gelb as
president of The New York Times Co. Foundation. The announcement
was made by Arthur Sulzberger Jr., chairman of New York Times Co.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment is effective Feb. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Created in 1956, The Times Foundation is a private charity that
provides grants to nonprofit institutions and administers The New
York Times Neediest Cases Fund and the recently established college
scholarship program. Last year, the foundation made $5 million in
grants and raised a record $6.7 million for the Neediest Cases.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal, 64, has been an assistant managing editor since 1993
as well as editor in chief of The New York Times Magazine. In 1982,
as editorial page editor, he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for
editorial writing.
</P>
<P>
   A former correspondent for Life magazine, Rosenthal joined The
Times as national urban affairs correspondent in 1969. In 1968, he
was the principal author of the Kerner Commission report on race
relations. Rosenthal graduated from Harvard University in 1956 with
a B.A. degree in history.
</P>
<P>
   Gelb, 75, has been president of The New York Times Co.
Foundation since Sept. 1, 1990. He retired as managing editor of
The Times earlier that year, completing a career in the newsroom
that began in 1944, when he started as a copy boy. He received a
B.A. degree in English from New York University in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   He held numerous positions at The Times, including drama critic,
chief cultural correspondent and cultural news editor, and was
metropolitan editor from 1967 to 1976. As deputy managing editor in
the late 1970s, he played an important role in the creation of new
daily feature sections _ Weekend, Living, Home, SportsMonday and
Science Times.
</P>
<P>
   Gelb will continue to oversee the scholarship program and write
a new three-volume biography and television documentary on Eugene
O'Neill, as well as a memoir about his career at The Times. With
his wife, Barbara, Gelb wrote ``O'Neill,'' the definitive biography
of the playwright.

AUTHOR'S BIRTH DAY A TIME TO REMEMBER JOYS OF LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE WILSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Someone apparently worn down by the hassles of daily
life composed what's become a well-traveled e-mail _ I've received
several copies and seen it posted on a couple of office boards _
that's called a ``resignation from adulthood.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter suffers from a schmaltzy tone, but there are times
when most of us can relate and wish to see life through younger,
more innocent eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to live simple again,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my day to consist of computer crashes, mountains
of paperwork, depressing news, how to survive more days in the
month than there is money in the bank, doctor bills, gossip,
illness and the loss of loved ones. I want to believe in the power
of smiles, hugs, a kind word, truth, justice, peace, dreams, the
imagination, mankind and making angels &UR; in the snow.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter made me think of E.B. White, the incandescent writer
born 100 years ago this summer. Though he would have shuddered at
its syntax, he would have respected the impulse.
</P>
<P>
   White was this century's greatest essayist, a poet and co-author
of ``The'' ``Elements of Style,'' the wisest writing guide ever
published. But none of his work surpassed his children's classic,``
Charlotte's Web''.
</P>
<P>
   Published in 1953, the book has sold more than 10 million
copies. Eudora Welty's review in the ``New York Times'' concluded:
``As a piece of work it is just about perfect.'' In a poll of
educators and authors two decades ago, it was named the best
children's story in American history.
</P>
<P>
   The book tells of a runt pig named Wilbur, whose life is saved
twice _ first by Fern, an 8-year-old farm girl, then by Charlotte,
a clever gray spider. The story line grew out of the death of one
of the author's own pigs on his Maine farm.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else he wrote, the book reveals White's
philosophy of life, expressed by all three characters.
</P>
<P>
   Through Fern, he celebrated a child's love of the world and the
view that nature's creations don't live on the Earth solely to
serve human desires.
</P>
<P>
   When told that Wilbur would be killed because he was a runt who
``will never amount to anything,'' she pleaded that being born
small wasn't his fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``If ``I'' had been very small at birth, would you have killed
me?'' she asked, persuading her father to spare the pig.
</P>
<P>
   Through Charlotte, he extolled the values of friendship and
looking out for the well-being of others. In her last conversation
with Wilbur, the pig asked why she had been done so much for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have been my friend,'' she told him. ``That in itself is a
tremendous thing. . . . After all, what's a life anyway? We're
born, we live a little while, we die. A spider's life can't help
being something of a mess, with all this trapping and eating of
flies. By helping you, perhaps I was trying to lift up my life a
trifle.''
</P>
<P>
   Through Wilbur, he spoke up for simple, everyday pleasures.
Wilbur was thrilled to be alive and considered the barn ``the best
place to be . . . this warm delicious cellar, with the garrulous
geese, the changing seasons, the passage of swallows, the nearness
of rats, the sameness of sheep, the love of spiders, the smell of
manure, and the glory of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   White, who died in 1985, spent two years writing the book, then
another year drafting revisions. Its magic comes from the childlike
sensibility it brings to such adult themes as loneliness, fear,
callousness, sacrifice and death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The integrity of White's view of the world owed much to the
boy he kept in touch with despite his own loss of innocence,''
wrote Scott Elledge, his biographer.
</P>
<P>
   White would say you don't need to resign from adulthood to see
life as a child sees it. In fact, he would say people can deal with
all manner of adult burdens and at the same time savor the power of
smiles, hugs, truth, imagination and angels in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   The joys and wonder of life don't go away as we get older, they
get covered up. They're still with us, dormant, waiting. Once in a
while someone comes along and tells a story that stirs our
awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Happy birthday, E.B. White. &QL;

HARRY WALKER DIES AT 80; FIDGETER WITH A PURPOSE
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Ala., Mo., Pa.)  (nk) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harry (the Hat) Walker, who made baseball history twice when he
won the National League batting title in 1947, died Sunday at
University of Alabama Hospital in Birmingham. Walker, who lived in
Leeds, Ala., was 80.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from a stroke, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, a left-handed-hitting outfielder, was the only National
Leaguer player to win a batting championship after playing for two
teams during the season. He played 10 games for the St. Louis
Cardinals, with a .200 average, and 130 games with the Philadelphia
Phillies, hitting .371, en route to capturing his 1947 batting
title with an overall average of .363.
</P>
<P>
   That accomplishment also produced the only brother combination
to win batting championships. Dixie Walker, Harry's older brother,
won the National League batting title in 1944 when he hit .357
playing the outfield for the Brooklyn Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The hugely popular Dixie Walker was the Peepul's Cherce, in the
Brooklynese of the day, while Harry was known as the Hat because he
was forever fidgeting with his cap at the plate, supposedly wearing
out at least a dozen hats a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I step away from the batter's box, fix my hat and my
hair, I relax my muscles,'' he said, ``and maybe I get the pitcher
and catcher upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker's most memorable at-bat came against the Boston Red Sox
at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis in Game 7 of the 1946 World
Series. With the scored tied, 3-3, with two out in the eighth
inning and Enos Slaughter on first base, he hit a drive to
left-center field that appeared to be a single. But center fielder
Leon Culberson, replacing the injured Dom DiMaggio, made a weak
relay throw to shortstop Johnny Pesky, who hesitated before
throwing home. Slaughter's ``mad dash'' scored the Series-winning
run as Walker, who hit .412 in the Series, wound up with a double.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A man who loved to talk, Walker was forever discoursing on
matters ranging from his hitting theories to the hard-nosed play of
the Cardinals' old Gas House Gang to his 12 factors for success
(attitude, initiative and adaptability among them).
</P>
<P>
   Walker became one of baseball's best-known batting instructors.
``The secret is waiting,'' he said. ``Stroke the ball, inside out.
The only kind of guy who should try to pull the ball is a guy who
can hit you 40 homers a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker hit only 10 in his career.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Harry William Walker was born in Pascagoula, Miss., and grew up
in Birmingham, a son of Ewart (Dixie) Walker, who pitched for the
Washington Senators, and a nephew of Ernie Walker, an outfielder
with the St. Louis Browns.
</P>
<P>
   He made his debut with the Cardinals in 1940, played on their
World Series-winning team of 1942 and pennant-winning club in 1943,
then spent two years in Army service, winning a Bronze Star
fighting in Germany with a reconnaissance unit.
</P>
<P>
   Walker hit .237 in the 1946 season, and when he got off to a
slow start in 1947, he was sent to the Phillies, then went on a
tear to capture the batting title. Dale Alexander, who led the
American League in batting in 1932 with a .367 average, playing for
the Tigers and Red Sox, was the only other man to win a batting
crown appearing with two teams.
</P>
<P>
   Walker later played for the Cubs, Reds and the Cardinals again
and had a .296 batting average in 11 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He was named the Cardinals' manager in May 1955, then was
dismissed at season's end after a seventh-place finish. Walker also
managed the Pittsburgh Pirates (1965-67) and the Houston Astros
(1968-72), but never finished higher than third place. He later
worked in the Cardinals' organization and spent eight years as
baseball coach at the University of Alabama-Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Dot; three daughters, Carole Miller,
Barbara Muir and Mary Peterson, all of Leeds, and four
grandchildren.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though a fine hitter, Walker was overshadowed by his Hall of
Fame teammates on the Cardinals, Stan Musial and Slaughter, and
perhaps by his brother Dixie. But he never grew tired of
celebrating the life of a baseball player.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't worry about what Musial was doing,'' he once
said. ``You've got to enjoy the game, love putting the uniform on.
You have to perform each day, because what you did yesterday is
history.'' &QL;

<P>
   The trouble with explaining Hedi Slimane and his remarkable rise
as the men's wear designer at Yves Saint Laurent _ the 20 percent
sales increase in the last year, the panting of stylists _ is that
it's a little like trying to explain why a woman falls in love with
the guy next door. One day she sees him as Mr. Ordinary, and the
next she's falling down in a swoon of delight. And all because she
suddenly turned her head and saw him in a different light.
</P>
<P>
   That, in a nutshell, is how a designer with no formal training
or obvious qualifications, apart from a tendency to be obsessive,
took a sleepy men's wear label and almost single-handedly (he has a
team; let's be fair) transformed it into one of the hottest names
in the business. Vince Ehly, the men's sportswear buyer at Barneys
New York, said that demand for Slimane's clothes is strong,
especially in Los Angeles, where his slender, elongating suits are
a hit with stylists catering to people in the movie industry.
Two-thirds of the spring collection sold at full price, Ehly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did as well as our more established collections,'' said
Ehly, who couldn't account for the rush, except to say, ``Here
comes Hedi, and the clothes look so different than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when Slimane (pronounced slim-ON) was hired,
Saint Laurent's men's wear was pretty much confined to a couple of
company-owned boutiques in New York and Paris, and a franchise in
London. And that's about as far as interest went. But today you can
find the clothes at Fred Segal in Los Angles, Collette in Paris and
Jeffrey in New York. This fall, Saks Fifth Avenue will start
carrying the line. Not long ago, Stephen Gan, the Visionaire
editor, who is a close friend of Slimane's, was in Cologne,
Germany, where, he noted with a sense of deja vu, the salesmen at
the ultra-hip boutique Citta di Bologna were all in Saint Laurent.
``I hadn't seen anything like that since the 1980s,'' Gan said.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, interest in Slimane's clothes _ the flat-front
trousers that drape subtly through the hips, the razor-sharp
shoulders that instantly say Saint Laurent _ has been almost an
underground thing. But that's changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become a fever,'' said Jim Moore, the fashion editor at
GQ magazine. ``There are guys now who will say, `Oh, I only wear
Saint Laurent and Gucci.''
</P>
<P>
   It's rare to hear so much enthusiasm for fashion, and
practically unheard of about a men's wear designer _ particularly
one whose clean, elegant style is so wildly at odds with the
shapeless, insipid sportswear that flattened the recent New York
men's shows. But perhaps that is why Slimane's clothes are
different. Their sex appeal is not based on over-the-top
embellishment or the latest inflated attitude. Rather, it comes
from the same honest principles that have always driven fashion:
cut, proportion and silhouette.
</P>
<P>
   Slimane has been in New York for the last couple of weeks,
visiting friends, and it was during the men's shows, in fact, which
he didn't attend, that he sat down over a sandwich at the Mercer
Hotel and talked about men, fashion and what he called ``the
psychology of people looking at Saint Laurent.''
</P>
<P>
   At 31, he is coolly elegant, with gray-blue eyes, and a crest of
hair that rises up on his head like a fin. He was born in Paris to
an Italian mother and a Tunisian father, who was an accountant.
Aside from going with his mother to buy fabric for her dressmaking
business, and waking to the hum of her sewing machine, nothing in
his background prepared him for fashion. At school, he said, he
studied political science with an idea of becoming a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Slimane conceded that it's difficult to explain how a novice
designer could be plucked from obscurity and put at one of the most
venerable houses in Paris. But he suggested that the reason was
somehow wrapped up in the mystique of Saint Laurent and, more, in
the mercurial nature of its chairman, Pierre Berge. ``I don't think
this house perhaps likes to hire known designers,'' said Slimane,
who was working for the Paris press agent Jean-Jacques Picart when
he was hired. Before that, he worked for the designer Jose Levy.
``It's something that makes Saint Laurent particular.''
</P>
<P>
   Hiring an unknown like Slimane for a men's-wear line that wasn't
exactly setting off fireworks probably didn't pose much of a risk,
either. Saint Laurent designed the collection in its early years,
but through the 1980s it gradually fell to others until the line
had almost no identity.
</P>
<P>
   As Slimane has gained more confidence, the thing that everyone
comments on is how much his collections evoke the style of Saint
Laurent without in the least seeming a homage. There is the
influence of the classic Saint Laurent tuxedo, or ``smoking,'' as
the French call it, and of course, the leather trench coat and the
see-through top, which is a nod to Saint Laurent's daring style in
the mid- &UR; ' &LR; 60s. But Slimane has given them a fresh currency on men.
``They're bold, without any fear,'' said Jeffrey Kalinsky, who owns
Jeffrey, which opened last week on West 14th Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it doesn't really seem appropriate in men's wear, I like
the idea of defining a silhouette,'' Slimane said.
</P>
<P>
   As Gan pointed out, having access to a couture house has given
Slimane's men's wear a deeper sensibility. ``It's very different,''
Slimane said. ``Saint Laurent has a real fashion culture. It's a
fashion house. So you have a creative freedom that is rare.'' He
has sought out the house's longtime suppliers for such things as
furs, jewelry and hats, all of which he has used, along with
sandals and tough-looking T-shirts, to slyly manipulate the gender
boundaries in clothes. Which Saint Laurent did, too.
</P>
<P>
   Then Slimane said: ``There's a feeling you have when you work at
Saint Laurent. It's very strong and very emotional. And it's part
of history. You know, when you go to the couture show, they still
read out the numbers like they did in the 1950s. This feeling is so
important to me, because it's something you sense that is fading.
It's also very important to the people of Paris, because it's their
link to the history of fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   But after five seasons at Saint Laurent, doesn't the brightest
young talent in men's wear find there is less mystery, which is
also part of the house's formidable legend and is fading fast?
Slimane laughed. ``Oh, no,'' he said. ``I think there is more,
really. That's what I love about it.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a funny way this is what sets Slimane himself apart: the
allure of the clothes can't be completely explained. ``You know,''
he said, ``men are not supposed to be mysterious. That's what you
say about women. But I think men can have a little of it, too.''

NAVAJOS BATTLE BOOTLEGGING WITH NEW LAWS  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL DONOVAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDOW ROCK - The Navajo Nation began its war on reservation
bootleggers last week with the approval of a number of new laws
that they hope will strip away their &UR; profits.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from a number of reservation communities who say
they wanted action and not rhetoric, members of the Navajo Nation
Council agreed to increase jail sentences and fines, allow the
courts to confiscate the bootlegger's property and paved the way
for families affected by bootlegging sales to take him to tribal
court for civil damages.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is being done, said Herbert Clah, director of public
safety for the tribe, because bootlegging has become the business
of choice for more and more tribal members because of the massive
unemployment _ up to 75 percent in some areas _ on the reservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's profitable,` he said. ``There was one woman
bootlegger prosecuted recently federally because she was making
$150,000 a year in profits. She had five brand new homes and had
bought new cars for all of her children.`
</P>
<P>
   Tribal police estimate that a good-sized bootlegging operation
on the reservation _ and there are a couple of hundred of these on
the 25,000 square-mile reservation _ make as much as $40,000 a year
in profits, tax-free. Part-timers, who may work only doing fairs or
when there is a local pow-wow or rodeo, can net several hundred
dollars for one day's work.
</P>
<P>
   But more and more communities began seeing the downside of the
bootlegging business as car fatalities blamed on drunken drivers
and domestic violence cases began rising. For the past decade,
Indian Health Service officials have listed alcohol abuse as the
number one cause of death among the 220,000-member tribe.
</P>
<P>
   The rebellion against bootleggers began in Tuba City where
community members began drawing up a list of local bootleggers and
publicly told them that their days were numbered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knew who the bootleggers were but no one wanted to do
anything about it,` said Hope MacDonald, head of the community's
planning committee that started working with local police and then
began putting pressure on council delegates to support changes that
were being proposed to stiffen reservation bootlegging laws.
</P>
<P>
   The new laws will increase fines from $500 to $5,000 and jail
sentences from six months to a year but everyone admits that the
increase in jail time may be more symbolic than threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bootleggers weren't getting any jail time when the penalty was
six months because the tribal jails were overcrowded,` said Clah.
Police officials had publicly complained about bootlegging
investigations that would take weeks ending up with the accused
getting a $50 fine and only spending a couple of hours in jail
while their paperwork was being done.
</P>
<P>
   Suing a bootlegger may be a futile effort since only a few of
the top bootleggers would have enough assets to justify taking them
to court, Clah said.
</P>
<P>
   So the key may be just how serious the tribe is about using
whatever space it has available in the tribal jails for bootleggers
and whether they carry through with their authority to seize cars
and property. There have also been threats that the tribe will
begin cancelling homesite leases for convicted bootleggers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bootleggers will be watching what happens in the next few
months to see if we actually enforce the new laws,` said Clah. ``If
they see nothing happening to the other bootleggers in their area,
nothing will change.`
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the reservation have learned from the past that
tougher laws dont really result in changes.
</P>
<P>
   `They've had laws on the books before to control bootleggers and
they havent used them, so I dont think there will be much changed,`
said Beth Cascaddan, who lives in Kayenta. ``They've had the power
to take away homesite leases in the past and havent done it.`
</P>
<P>
   She added that even if the tribe gets tough, bootleggers will
find a way around the laws. ``There's just too much money to make
from it,` she said.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald said she also was sceptical about how much the new
laws will change because of lax enforcement by tribal law
enforcement officials in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're not going to stop pushing the police now that new
laws have been passed. We look at this as the beginning of our
efforts,` she said.
</P>
<P>
   The community has asked tribal attorneys to draft an
inter-government agreement which they plan to take to officials in
Coconino County in an effort to go after liquor stores in
communities like Flagstaff that are making a profit by selling
liquor to the bootleggers.

GORE RECALLS DAD'S FIGHT TO HELP BLACKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LORI RODRIGUEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Vice President Al Gore on Monday evoked the memory of
his father and the battles that Southern senator fought for civil
rights earlier this century in an effort to woo blacks gathering in
Houston to the idea that Gore will continue fighting for civil
rights in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was intensely proud of my father's opposition to the poll
tax in the 1940s and support for civil rights in the 1950s and the
Voting Rights Act in 1965,'' Gore said, recalling battles fought by
his father, former Sen. Al Gore Sr., who died in December.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's lengthy and warmly received speech Monday to more than
3,000 National Urban League conferees at the George R. Brown
Convention Center came on the heels of brief and more coolly met
remarks by Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential
front-runner, on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is the front-runner for the 2000 Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the U.S. Senate in those years, there was a document
drafted called the Southern Manifesto, and it became a great
symbolic rallying point for the opponents of integration,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore reminded the league that his father and fellow Tennessean
Estes Kefauver were the only Southern senators who refused to sign
``that hateful document.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In honor of my dad,'' Gore promised his receptive audience,
``I am determined that the gains we've made this century for civil
rights will be only the beginning of the gains we make in the 21st
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore made repeated reference to his long friendship with league
Executive Director Hugh B. Price and other black notables on the
dais with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a kinship with the work you have been doing,'' Gore
said, reeling off a list of Clinton administration accomplishments
he said have culminated in the lowest black unemployment and
poverty rates in history.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who was repeatedly applauded, addressed the league after a
personal meeting with the family of James Byrd, the East Texas
black man who was dragged to death behind a pickup by white
supremacists outside Jasper. One of the three defendants has been
convicted in the case. Trial is pending in the other cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say here, as I said to them privately, `God bless
you for leading us toward healing and reconciliation with dignity
and grace and courage,''' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That heinous crime wounded not only the Byrd family and the
Jasper community, it wounded the American spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore pledged he would fight for passage of the federal Hate
Crimes Prevention Act, which has been passed unanimously by the
Senate and is awaiting action by the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me call on all political leaders in both parties to end
their silence and support hate crimes legislation,'' Gore said.
``One of our greatest presidents, Abraham Lincoln, said in the
famous words (of Edmund Burke), `All that is necessary for evil to
triumph is for good men to do nothing.'''
</P>
<P>
   The reference was one of many jabs toward Bush, who has come
under heavy criticism for failing to push a hate-crimes measure
through the Texas Legislature this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes courage and conscience to cross those conservatives
who have no compassion,'' Gore said, in what became a repeated
litany that poked fun at Bush's campaign theme of ``compassionate
conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   At a separate session devoted to black political power in the
next century, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, and civil-rights
leader Jesse Jackson said the ever-increasing influence of money in
political campaigns, noting Bush's considerable war chest in
particular, represents a disturbing trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is vulgar,'' said Jackson. ``What we need to do is make
that level of fund-raising illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also criticized Bush for his decision not to push the
hate-crimes bill through the Texas Legislature earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush Junior equivocates on hate crimes,'' Jackson said.
``Anyone who equivocates on hate crimes, they send us a message
that intelligent people must recognize.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel, which included NAACP leader Kweisi Mfume, also
debated whether the Democratic Party is the best political option
for blacks, concluding that it remained so.
</P>
<P>
   The panel members also disagreed with the notion that the
growing number of Hispanics in the United States would weaken
blacks' political clout.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they said, the change would only help the groups work
together and form a stronger voice for minorities in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our politics are the same,'' Mfume said. ``That is, to find a
way to build coalitions one on top of the other to bring about
change and break down barriers, and to do that without apology.''
</P>
<P>
   While Price refused to draw comparisons between the two leading
presidential candidates, he praised Gore for hosting a series of
private, unpublicized, off-the-record discussions in his home the
last few years on urban and racial issues. Gore also attended the
last four consecutive conventions, Price said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten to know him very well,'' Price said, noting that
Gore has called him at home to solicit input. ``There's just a very
good working relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about the issues. Is he on the same page with us
about the issues that we care about _ and people heard a number of
high notes today that clearly resonated with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Price said conferees were pleased that Bush had attended the
opening ceremonies Sunday. ``I extended an invitation to him on the
spot to attend our annual conference in New York City next year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only problem is that it might conflict with the Republican
National Convention,'' which will be in late July 2000 in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Gore's only rival
for the Democratic nomination, will address the groupTuesday.
Bradley, a former New York Knicks basketball star, had made race a
central issue of his campaign.

MILTON BRUMER, 97, ENGINEER FOR FAMED NEW YORK BRIDGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Fla.)  (mk) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Milton Brumer, an engineer who managed the construction of such
mighty bridges as the Verrazano-Narrows over New York Bay, the
Throgs Neck over the East River in New York and the Walt Whitman
over the Delaware, died Thursday at a hospital in Boca Raton, Fla.
He was 97 and lived in Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   In a career that spanned half a century, Brumer had prime
responsibility for major engineering projects all over the world.
He supervised construction of portions of the Garden State Parkway
in New Jersey, the New Jersey Turnpike, the Connecticut Turnpike,
the Long Island, N.Y., Expressway, the Palisades Interstate Parkway
in New York and New Jersey and the Ohio Turnpike. He was the
engineer in charge of numerous bridges of reinforced concrete and
steel for the Victoria Mines Railroad in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   He brought his expertise to New York City-area projects like the
Outerbridge Crossing, Goethals Bridge, George Washington Bridge,
Bayonne Bridge and the Lincoln Tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Brumer started his career as an assistant engineer in 1923 with
Interborough Rapid Transit Co. and later worked for the
Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission as a tunnel designer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, Brumer joined the engineering consulting firm of Othmar
H. Ammann, the fabled builder of the George Washington Bridge, the
Triborough Bridge and other projects. By 1949, he had become a
partner in the firm, which was then known as Ammann and Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   Brumer became president of the company in 1965, retiring in
1977. He was chief engineer and consultant on highway projects,
harbor improvements and tunnel construction throughout the
Northeast. When he was chief engineer of the building of the
Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, which links Brooklyn and Staten Island,
it was at the time of its completion, in 1964, the longest
suspension bridge in the world. Its size was surpassed by the
Humber Bridge in England in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Milton Brumer was born in Philadelphia on Jan. 21, 1902, raised
in Brooklyn, and was a longtime resident of the Riverdale section
of the Bronx. He was recently nominated to the Hall of Fame of the
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, from which he received a
mechanical engineering degree and an honorary doctorate of
engineering. He also received a master's degree from the University
of Alabama. He was named Engineer of the Year in 1965 by the
American Society of Civil Engineers Metropolitan Section.
</P>
<P>
   Brumer's wife died in 1996. He is survived by two daughters,
Barbara Lee Brumer of Boca Raton and Carolyn Faith Graham of
Hartsdale, N.Y.; two granddaughters and four great-grandsons.

 &HT;    Cross-country cyclists discover america, selves
 &HT;    By Michelle Hiskey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the middle of the night, Jennifer Eyl zoomed down a
Colorado mountainside so fast that her contact flew out of her
right eye. Legally blind without that vision aid, she kept flying,
the lights of a van behind her trailing her down the steep, winding
road.
</P>
<P>
   The story would have been scary enough in a convertible or even
in a car with the windows down. But Eyl was pushing 65 mph on a
custom-made racing bike, on a four-woman relay team competing in
the Race Across America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a moment so thrilling I felt I was barely in my body,''
said Eyl, 27.
</P>
<P>
   Eyl and her friends took just six days to reach Savannah, Ga.
from California, fueled by $35,000 in sponsorships; other local
cyclists have set off at a more leisurely pace and with a fraction
of that financial commitment. Whatever their means, those athletes
share a desire to conquer the Everest of their sport: a bicycle
trip across the country. While most Americans see the country by
car or plane, a Tour de America affords a far more intimate view of
the heartland at lower speed and on the back roads.
</P>
<P>
   The adventure is not only physically punishing but mentally
exhilirating. Cross-country bikers recount unforgettable, sometimes
hair-raising moments such as Eyl's escapade in the Rockies, as well
as bucolic, introspective times on the endless plains. The cyclists
come to realize that their journey is not just about reaching their
destination, but discovering themselves and their homeland along
the way. Completing the long-planned trek rewards them with a sense
that life's possibilities are limitless.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you persevere at something, and take small strides every
day, you can accomplish a great goal,'' Brian Kaplan of Decatur
said, speaking on a crackling cellphone from an RV parked in an
Oregon campground. He expects to arrive at the Pacific Ocean today,
in the culmination of a ``journey of the soul'' across 14 states
that began June 14 in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   With his 40th birthday next month, the environmental-health
scientist wanted to take on a monumental physical challenge, and
because he loved to bicycle, he thought about pedaling coast to
coast. ``But just doing it for that reason seemed pretty empty,''
he said, so he decided to use the trip to promote awareness of
mental illness, which has affected his brother for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan and his wife, Joan, started planning the $3,500 trek a
year ago. He arranged time off from his work by taking accrued
vacation followed by an unpaid leave. She quit her job as a Delta
Air Lines gate agent to drive the RV.
</P>
<P>
   Averaging 80 miles a day on his Raleigh R300 touring bike,
Kaplan had time to ponder the optical illusion of Wyoming
stormclouds (''You wonder if you're coming to it or it's coming to
you''), the eerieness of the Idaho desert (''You hear about ghost
towns, but it really gives you an uneasy feeling'') and the stench
of road kill (''Even if you don't see it, you can smell it''). He
ascended one pass in Montana and, several hundred feet below, could
see the rocks in the bottom of a clear, unspoiled river.
</P>
<P>
   ``No trash, no people, just nature,'' Joan said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's journals detail how they have met people along the
way who have shared with them how they have struggled like Brian's
brother, and the trip has raised $22,000 so far for the National
Alliance for the Mentally Ill. Peachtree Settlement Funding, a
financial company, donated $10,000, and Whole Foods Market is
planning a welcome-back party for the couple later this month.
</P>
<P>
   That barnstorming aspect of a cross-country trip attracts
charities that sponsor group rides in exchange for pledges, and
it's the reason Oprah Winfrey's personal trainer, Bob Greene,
promoted his latest book by pedaling 3,335 miles from Los Angeles
to New York earlier this summer. But it's not what originally
attracted grass-roots cyclists.
</P>
<P>
   Bicycling cross-country caught on in 1976 when more than 4,000
cyclists set out on the Bikecentennial TransAmerica Bicycle Trail,
with half of them completing the 4,240-mile route. From that event
was born the nonprofit Adventure Cycling Association, which has
mapped 25,000 miles of American bicycling routes and annually sells
20,000 copies of its three cross-country maps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as big of a fringe activity as you might think,''
said Kevin Condit, marketing director of the Adventure Cycling
Association; Condit cycled from coast to coast in 1993. ``You might
stereotype the average cyclist that is going cross-country as a
college student or a teacher, but it's really not. It tends to be
someone who is older than you think, and men and women are evenly
split. We've had everyone from a 12-year-old to someone who's 85,
so physical ability is less important than you think. They just
need a mindset that they really want to explore the country under
their own power.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Eyl. She bicycled alone 3,000 miles from Atlanta to San
Francisco shortly after the Olympics, and almost immediately
started recruiting members and sponsors back East for the
high-speed RAAM chase. It was the challenge she needed to keep in
shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not in good shape when you do this the first time,
you will be when you're done,'' she said. ``My legs were like
rocks.''
</P>
<P>
   On her solo trek westward, the University of Georgia
classical-history graduate loaded her bike with camping gear and
stopped at all sort of podunk attractions, such as a barbed-wire
museum in Kansas. ``The worst part was my mom crying every night
when I called,'' said Eyl. The trip took her three months.
</P>
<P>
   On RAAM, she never stopped, not by choice. While two riders
slept in the RV, the other pair alternated riding, supported by
three vans. Eyl kept going through bouts of projectile vomiting
caused by drinking too many fluids. Communication breakdowns
stalled the team for more than 10 hours and left emotions beyond
frayed. Eyl's team finished in a blur of six days, 22 hours and 14
minutes, and the only scenery she remembers is a Mennonite farm in
Tennessee, where a horse pulled a plow and a farmwife dressed in
black and white.
</P>
<P>
   ``RAAM is not just an athletic event; it's like a Mount Everest
expedition,'' she said. ``It takes physical strength and stamina
(and) so many other variables. And it creates a gusto of emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Rush, 42, of Atlanta chose the middle ground between
Eyl's sprint and Kaplan's marathon. To ease the financial hit of
taking time off from his work, he paid $3,600 to join the
month-long, 3,404-mile Fast Ride Across America sponsored by a
touring company named America by Bicycle. Raising money for the
Atlanta Bicycle Campaign made his trip tax-deductible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started out being a physical challenge,'' Rush said, ``but
it turned out to be a mental and spiritual and emotional
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   He averaged 110 miles a day from Los Angeles to Boston, an
ordeal that cut his body fat in half. He endured sleet in Arizona
so thick that he found himself riding behind a snowplow; deserts so
stark that a wolf crossed right in front of his LeMond Zurich
racer; and people so friendly that they formed an impromptu welcome
wagon after the mailman alerted them to their two-wheeled visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Rush became so close to the 16 fellow riders that
three of them shaved their heads to seal their friendship and
talked each other into sticking it out when some wanted to quit.
Today, they send e-mail letters to each other all the time. The
trip made him feel fortunate for what he has, including a line of
work that allowed him the freedom to take the trip. He doesn't feel
as impatient for success or material possessions, just for his next
adventure to begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing I can do this,'' Rush said, ``makes me know I could do
almost anything I wanted to if I prepare for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Eyl said she wouldn't mind cycling across the country a third
time. ``Doing something like this changes your idea of what is
possible and makes you realize that boundaries and limitation are
usually self-imposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan's odyssey changed him. When he looks in the mirror, he
sees a face that is thinner and longer because he's lost so much
body fat. ``We feel extremely upbeat about the next 40 years,'' he
said, and part of the reason is that, slowly and up close, he's
seen the country _ and himself _ in a way he never had before.

   &UR; ``THE DESCENT'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Jeff Long (Crown, $24)
</P>
<P>
   What this horror story loses in bizarre plot twists, it makes up
in audacity and dogged inventiveness. Long's setup goes on for
chapters, during which we meet lots of people and witness lots of
gore. In the end, we're sure of just one thing: Something awful
lives under the ground. It surfaces in an isolated Tibetan cave
where guide Ike Crockett takes refuge from a storm with a group of
wealthy (and doomed) clients. It surfaces in a South African leper
colony where a beautiful nun named Ali hears of a ``hungry God''
who kills men and chops them up for parts. And it surfaces in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, where NATO soldier Elias Branch watches
otherworldly creatures rise from a mass grave and attack his
crippled helicopter. The demons have already dispatched Branch's
navigator, hideously, but Branch survives to initiate the discovery
and exploration of a vast network of tunnels deep beneath the
Earth's surface, where are found body parts, crude jewelry and
footprints that aren't quite human. The penetration of the
underground becomes a worldwide military effort until more than
250,000 soldiers are slaughtered in the tunnels in a single day, a
well-planned mass execution that gives world leaders a sense of
what they're facing. ``Hell exists,'' the U.S. president announces.
``It is real. A geological, historical place beneath our very feet.
And it is inhabited. Savagely.'' Yes folks, it's Satan's empire
we're talking about here, and it's not pretty. Branch goes bravely
back into the tunnels, where he finds Ike Crockett alive after
years of captivity underground, and the ravaged Ike finds an odd
romance with Ali the nun. If Satan is a bit disappointing when he
finally shows up, you'll be too busy keeping up with all of the
other action to really care. It's a late summer page-turner that
you're unlikely to put down. &QL; 
 &UR; ``LETTERS FROM YELLOWSTONE''By Diane Smith (Viking, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This novel, written as a collection of letters, is set in 1898
and begins with a formal note from A.E. Bartram, a New York medical
student with a passion for botany, who asks to join a field study
of Yellowstone National Park. The request is greeted with
enthusiasm by the leader of the expedition, Montana Professor
Howard Merriam, and letters fly among Bartram, Merriam and their
families and colleagues before the expedition meets in Montana.
This early correspondence shows Bartram to be a clever, industrious
and ambitious young scientist who relishes the chance to make a
career in botany. Bartram's arrival in Montana causes confusion and
dismay, however, when Merriam learns that Alex Bartram is a woman _
and a determined one at that. She persists quietly as Merriam frets
about her ability to endure wilderness existence and about the
pragmatic obstacles of including a lone woman in a company of men.
But Bartram stays and becomes a delightful character. So does
Andrew Rutherford, a fellow scientist who writes amusingly about
the upheaval Alex's presence causes and about how ably she sticks
to the business at hand. Meanwhile, Howard Merriam's letters to his
mother reflect his growing respect for the woman he wanted so
desperately to send packing. Many things emerge in this story _ a
portrait of scientists at work at the turn of the century, a look
at the West at a time of change, the beauty and danger of
Yellowstone, and the story of a forthright woman and the men who
come to admire her. Smith began with a beguiling idea and has
turned it into an enchanting book. &QL; 
 &UR; ``TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE: THE COLOSSAL BOOK OF URBAN LEGENDS'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Jan Harold Brunvand (Norton, $29.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reading this is like going through photo albums _ the pleasure
is in the recognition. The most famous American urban legend is, of
course, ``The Hook'' (a homicidal maniac left it hanging on the car
door of a couple just returned from a lovers' lane). Then there's
``Kentucky Fried Rat,'' or, as New &AMP; Notable has always known it,
``Kentucky Fried Rodent,'' which leaves room for variation. ``The
Hairy-Armed Hitchhiker'' is good, or ``The Killer in the Back
Seat'' (this inspired a testy exchange between Brunvand and David
Letterman, which Brunvand describes here with some remorse). Or
there are the harmless ones, such as that Internet favorite about
the Neiman Marcus cookies. It's true, however, that many urban
legends are disgusting or disturbing or both (we like to tell
stories about the worst possible things that can happen to us), and
that this is where we throw all taste and political correctness to
the wind. There are legends about toilets, AIDS, dead babies, sex,
even pets-in-the-microwave _ something for everyone to enjoy. &QL; 
 &UR; ``BILL AND HILLARY: THE MARRIAGE''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Christopher Andersen (Morrow, $27.50) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was in Hillary's White House bedroom that Bill Clinton
finally told her that he had, indeed, had an affair with Monica
Lewinsky. As she sat, stunned, on the edge of her bed, Andersen
writes, ``the president of the United States got down on his knees
and, weeping, begged her forgiveness.'' We assume that Andersen was
crouched behind a nearby potted plant during this exchange, and
that he knew where all the White House plants were and moved from
one to the other in search of dirt. Of course, not all of his
information came by way of espionage. Some was procured from former
presidential adviser Dick Morris, who is on everyone's most-admired
list. Andersen (``The Day Diana Died'') looks at the Clintons from
courtship to current status, whatever that may be. Other than
painful descriptions of Chelsea Clinton's misery during the
Lewinsky revelations, it has the feel of old, tired news _ it made
us feel old and tired just to read it. We hope you fare better. &QL;

CLAUDETTE SOREL, 66, CONCERT PIANIST AND TEACHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., France)  (mk) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Claudette Sorel, a pianist who was at her best in music that
demanded delicacy and lyricism but who also gave highly regarded
performances of difficult contemporary works and big Romantic
showpieces, died on Friday at her home in Hampton Bays, N.Y. She
was 66.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said a spokesman for the J. Ronald Scott
Funeral Home in Hampton Bays.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sorel was born in Paris in 1932, and was already a promising
pianist when her family fled France just before the German invasion
in 1940. When her family settled in New York, Ms. Sorel became a
student of the Hungarian concert pianist Sari Biro. In 1942 she
received a scholarship to the Juilliard School, where she studied
with Olga Samaroff.
</P>
<P>
   After a year at Juilliard, Ms. Sorel made her recital debut at
Town Hall at age 11. Noel Straus, reviewing the concert in The New
York Times, wrote of her performance of a Mendelssohn Etude that
``a child capable of so polished and eloquent an example of pianism
has a future worth watching.''
</P>
<P>
   With Samaroff's encouragement she performed regularly in
recitals and as an orchestral soloist. Once Samaroff arranged for
her to play the Prokofiev Piano Concerto No. 3, a work she had
never studied, on a week's notice. She performed several times in
the New York Philharmonic's youth concerts before making her formal
debut with the orchestra, at age 17, with the MacDowell Piano
Concerto No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   As her career progressed, she continued her studies. After
Samaroff's death in 1948 she enrolled at the Curtis Institute of
Music in Philadelphia, where she studied with Rudolf Serkin and
Mieczyslaw Horszowski. She received an artist's diploma from Curtis
in 1953 and a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Columbia
University the same year.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1940s and '50s Ms. Sorel toured as a soloist, often
including on her programs works written for her by American
composers, among them Lukas Foss, Howard Hanson, Paul Creston and
Peter Mennin. Her last performance in New York was a 1973 recital
at Alice Tully Hall devoted entirely to music by Rachmaninoff, in
honor of the centenary of his birth. Included on the program were
two previously unknown Nocturnes that Rachmaninoff composed when he
was 14. Ms. Sorel had discovered them while researching the
composer at the Moscow Conservatory. She edited the published
versions of the works.
</P>
<P>
   A fall on an icy sidewalk in 1974 ended her performing career.
But Ms. Sorel, who had no immediate survivors, was established as a
teacher by then. She taught at the University of Kansas, Ohio State
University and the State University of New York at Fredonia.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Rachmaninoff works, Ms. Sorel edited some of
Arensky's piano works for publication. She also published several
books for pianists, including ``A Compendium of Piano Technique,''
``17 Little Piano Studies'' and ``Mind Your Musical Manners.''
Recently she edited ``From Madam: Selected Writings of Olga
Samaroff Stokowski From Her Years at the Juilliard School.''

BOXING NOTEBOOK: TYSON SCRAPS DOUGLAS; HOLYFIELD JOINS TALKS; HOPE
FOR GONZALEZ-TSZYU 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Tyson, the former heavyweight champion, is back to square
one in regard to an opponent for his Oct. 2 bout at the MGM Grand
in Las Vegas. James ``Buster'' Douglas has been scratched as a
possibility for that fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike is anxious to return to the ring and is looking to fight
someone that will be physically and mentally ready to fight in
October,'' Tyson's promoter, Dan Goossen of America Presents, said
Monday. ``At this point, Douglas does not fit that description.''
</P>
<P>
   Goossen and Tyson will now concentrate on the other two
candidates, Zeljko Mavrovic and Orlin Norris. Douglas, who scored a
stunning 10th-round knockout of Tyson in February 1990, may have
fallen out of contention because the Nevada State Athletic
Commission had planned to put him through a battery of physical
exams before allowing him to fight.
</P>
<P>
   The commission was concerned that Douglas, now 39, had ballooned
to nearly 400 pounds and lapsed into a diabetic coma in 1994.
Douglas lost the weight and made a comeback in 1996, but some in
Tyson's camp feared he would not have passed the physical.
</P>
<P>
   A Meeting With HBO
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to salvage his heavyweight unification rematch with
Lennox Lewis in November, Evander Holyfield will join the promoter
Don King in negotiations with HBO executives on Thursday afternoon.
Negotiations for the rematch hit a snag when HBO inserted a clause
in the contract that would remove King as the lead promoter if he
was indicted for any wrongdoing associated with the first
Holyfield-Lewis bout.
</P>
<P>
   That bout, on March 13 at Madison Square Garden in New York,
ended in a controversial draw. King has refused to sign the
contract, saying the clause infringes on his personal liberties.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to see what's going on for himself,'' King said of
Holyfield's meeting HBO officials. ``Hopefully, it can be worked
out. If not, we'll go from there. But I'm not compromising on
anything. You can't be a hypocrite.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Seth Abraham, the president of Time-Warner Sports,
was in London last Tuesday, holding discussions with Lewis about a
possible bout with Michael Grant for the November date that is set
aside for the Holyfield-Lewis rematch.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham said he remained optimistic that the Holyfield-Lewis
rematch could be saved. He also said, ``Lewis needs to keep busy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez-Tszyu on Showtime?
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited junior-welterweight bout between Miguel Angel
Gonzalez and Kostya Tszyu may finally take place on Aug. 21.
</P>
<P>
   There is still some dispute about the Gonzalez-Tszyu bout. The
promoter Dan Goossen believes he has a 50 percent stake in the bout
after reaching a settlement of a lawsuit against Don King last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Goossen will be in New York next Wednesday to ask a judge to
clarify the situation on the bout. Showtime had been saving that
Aug. 21 pay-per-view date for Mike Tyson.

DISNEY LOOKS TO SELL ANGELS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ According to published reports, the Walt
Disney Co. is looking into selling the Anaheim Angels only three
years after purchasing the club from Gene Autry.
</P>
<P>
   Published reports say the club is losing too much money.
According to the New York Times, one baseball official suggested
Disney's decision is based on financial losses in baseball.
However, an executive with another major-league team told the
newspaper the move is linked to Disney's multimillion-dollar
settlement in the lawsuit filed by former studio chief Jeffrey
Katzenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Angels spokesman Tim Mead had the following response to the
published reports: ``We're referring all comment to the unnamed
baseball sources . . . in the New York paper. We don't comment on
rumor and speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney purchased the Angels from Autry in 1996, paying 25
percent _ or about $30 million _ and taking over operation with the
agreement they would pay the remaining 75 percent upon Autry's
death.
</P>
<P>
   Autry died last October and Disney paid the balance.
</P>
<P>
   The team reportedly lost $11 million in 1994 and $12 million in
'95, the last two years Autry ran the club. Part of Disney's
takeover included paying $70 million of the approximate $110
million it cost to renovate the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels signed Mo Vaughn to a six-year, $80 million contract
last November, the biggest contract in club history and the
second-highest average annual salary ($13.3 million) in all of
baseball. The club's $52 million payroll this season ranks as the
13th highest among baseball's 30 teams.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the highest payroll in baseball this year is the
New York Yankees' $85 million. The Dodgers rank No. 2 at $79
million and the Montreal Expos have the smallest payroll at $17
million.

Before it was sacked by British and French troops in 1860, the

of China's finest landscapes and, for royal amusement, a

EDITORIAL: A WELCOME OIL DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Aug. 10:
</P>
<P>
   If someone had wanted to make America's trade laws look
ridiculous, he might have come up with the strategy that was used
by a group of small domestic oil companies when they asked the
government for relief from the ``dumping'' of cheap crude oil into
America. It is good that the Commerce Department on Monday
dismissed the petition, but the fact that it could be filed at all
shows that the anti-dumping law is far too broad.
</P>
<P>
   To dismiss the case, the Commerce Department went to great
lengths to show that most of the domestic oil industry was opposed
to the petition. The scope of the law is such that if a majority of
the companies had wanted protection, the case would have had to
proceed _ probably leading to high tariffs on oil long before the
facts were determined. That is because the law calls for tariffs to
be collected while a case proceeds, with refunds to be made if the
exporter eventually prevails.
</P>
<P>
   The American anti-dumping law is so broad that a domestic
industry can claim relief based on the fact that a foreign company
managed to sell its product to someone else for more than it was
able to get from an American importer _ even if the price charged
here was above the exporter's costs. That was part of the case the
domestic companies made against Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Iraq and
Venezuela after world oil prices plunged last year.
</P>
<P>
   The application of anti-dumping laws in the case of an
international commodity such as oil is absurd, since it is the
market _ not any individual exporting country _ that sets the
price. Some of the countries being complained about have production
costs far below those of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The United States preaches free trade, but its anti-dumping law
provides a protectionist barrier that shields uncompetitive
industries. The law should be narrowed to assure that a case such
as the oil companies filed would be impossible even if the entire
industry wanted the protection.

 EDITORIAL: RUSSIA'S PARADE OF PRIME MINISTERS  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Aug. 10:
</P>
<P>
   These are strange and dispiriting times in Moscow. By sacking
another prime minister Monday _ the fourth in the last 17 months _
Boris Yeltsin invites parody at a moment when his country
desperately needs stability. Yeltsin and his evanescent governments
seem increasingly irrelevant to the lives of most Russians, a sorry
picture for a man who did much to free his nation from the
stranglehold of communism.
</P>

   As Yeltsin heads into the final year of his presidency, he seems
more interested in finding a successor than a prime minister.
Ensuring that Russia's next president is a democratic reformer is a
laudable goal, if that is Yeltsin's intent, but the way to get
there is not by appointing a succession of mediocre prime
ministers. In picking them, Yeltsin mistakes fealty for leadership
and fails to recognize that such rapid turnover in the Kremlin is
likely to discredit anyone associated with him.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's latest selection, Vladimir Putin, shares some of the
same questionable qualifications as his immediate predecessors,
Sergei Stepashin, who lasted only three months, and Yevgeny
Primakov, who served for nine months. All three held senior
positions in the Russian security services that succeeded the
Soviet KGB, organizations not known for teaching the fine points of
democracy. During the Cold War Putin, who is 46, worked as a top
Russian spy in Germany, and most recently ran Russia's internal
security service.
</P>
<P>
   None of these men had experience in economic management when
they were appointed prime minister, making it difficult for them to
devise programs that might revive Russia's sinking economy. If
Putin is confirmed by the Communist-dominated Duma, he will have to
move quickly to show the International Monetary Fund that he is
exercising budgetary restraint, collecting taxes effectively and
taking other steps to justify a new round of lending.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's clumsy efforts to stage-manage the next presidential
election now leave Putin as his designated candidate in a likely
field of far more prominent, seasoned politicians. Other possible
contenders include Primakov; Yuri Luzhkov, the mayor of Moscow;
Gennadi Zyuganov, the Communist Party leader, and Aleksandr Lebed,
a former general who is now governor of a region in Siberia. So far
the only prospective candidate with strong democratic credentials
is Grigory Yavlinsky, who has had difficulty building a national
base. It is hard to imagine how Putin, with no experience in
electoral politics and no organized party behind him, can expect to
compete for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, enfeebled by heart problems and frequent bouts of
pneumonia, is more a subject of ridicule than respect in Russia.
With Russian troops once again engaged in military combat in the
Caucasus region, this time against several thousand Islamic
militants, Russians can only wonder what Yeltsin's next surprise
will be.
