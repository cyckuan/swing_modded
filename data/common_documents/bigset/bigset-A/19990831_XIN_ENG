<HEADLINE> German Foreign Minister Backs Poland's Quick Entrance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 30 (Xinhua)-Berlin supports Poland to get the
European Union (EU) membership "as quickly as possible", said
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer Monday at the annual
meeting with his Polish and French counterpart, Bronislaw Geremek
and Hubert Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
"Ten years after the end of Cold War there is the question,
when the EU can also overstep the former border between the two
blocks," Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
"In my personal view, Poland is already a EU member," he added,
underlining the fact that Poland had been accepted as a NATO
member and its economy had been closely integrated with Germany
and the EU.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, also known as "Weimar Triangle", is an initiative
raised by then German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher in
1991. Since that year, ministers of Germany, France and Poland
have held talks every year in one of the three countries.
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased and satisfied that Poland, Germany and France are
working together for the building-up of Europe, on the eve of the
60th anniversary of German intrusion in Poland," said Fischer,
recalling that Nazi Germany attacked Poland and triggered World
War II on September 1, 1939.
</P>
<P>
The meeting in Weimar, the "European Cultural Capital" known
for German poet and writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, was also
focused on cultural issues. This year is the 250th anniversary of
Goethe's birth.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine suggested that, the "triangle meeting" should be
extended into cultural fields in the future, and cultural
institutes of the three countries should better coordinate with
each other.
</P>
<P>
"Europe is a cultural unity," said Geremek. The Polish minister
stressed the Slavic culture, to which belongs the Polish culture,
was "a part of European cultural heritage."
</P>
<P>
Further, they discussed the situation in Kosovo, and reaffirmed
their top goal of building a "multi-ethnic and pluralistic"
society in the war-torn region, according to Fischer.
</P>
<P>
Political aides of the three ministers are drafting a common
bulletin on these issues, he said.

<HEADLINE> Canada Reports Travel Deficit Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Statistics reported
Monday an increase of 392 million Canadian dollars (about 263
million U.S. dollars) in travel deficit for the second quarter of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Canadians spent 4.1 billion Canadian dollars (about 2.8 billion
U.S. dollars) travelling abroad between April and June, a rise of
0.1 percent from the first quarter, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
For the same period, foreigners spent 3.7 billion Canadian
dollars (about 2.5 billion U.S. dollars) in the country, a drop of
5.7 percent from the first three months, according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
The second quarter travel deficit is largely attributed to
Americans, whose spending in Canada dropped 3.3 percent to almost
2.4 billion Canadian dollars (about 1.6 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
That alone left a deficit of 216 million Canadian dollars
(about 145 million U.S. dollars), as Canadians spent nearly 2.6
billion dollars of their own (about 1.7 billion U.S. dollars) in
the U.S..
</P>
<P>
More Canadians were reported to go south of the border for fun
and shopping from April to June, as a result of a three percent
increase in the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar against the
U.S. dollar.

ADDIS ABABA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Water Resources
Minister Shiferaw Jarso has urged to develop water resources in
the country and help more people to have access to clean water.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Talks Remain Deadlocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators failed to break the deadlock in their talks Monday
night over the implementation of a U.S.-brokered peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
After meeting for several hours with Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak's envoy Gilad Sher in Jerusalem, senior Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat said gaps still remain between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said the talks will resume Tuesday while
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat will travel
to Egypt to brief Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the latest
development of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have been engaged in intensified efforts to reach
an agreement on Israeli proposals over the modification of the Wye
interim agreement before United States Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright starts a visit to the region on September 1.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Barak abandoned an ultimatum to the
Palestinians, saying he expected answers from Arafat within three
days on whether he would accept the proposed modification of the
Wye agreement, signed last October by Arafat and Barak's hard-line
predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated, however, that if Arafat rejects the modification
proposal, Israel would carry it out "by the book," or according to
Israeli interpretation, which analysts said would harm further
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
</P>
<P>
His extension of deadline was a retreat from an ultimatum he
issued Sunday night to the Palestinians after the negotiations hit
a snag over the release of Palestinian prisoners and the timetable
for a final Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his office, Barak threatened to halt
the negotiations and to implement the Wye agreement according to
Israeli interpretation if the Palestinians did not give
"satisfactory answers" within "the coming hours". Israeli sources
said the "coming hours" means until Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said the prime minister spoke with Arafat by
telephone Monday, but failed to break the current deadlock. The
deadline passed without any signs of Palestinian backing down.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have hoped to sign a memorandum on the
implementation of the Wye accord in Cairo, Egypt Thursday at
Albright's presence.
</P>
<P>
The main issues blocking a breakthrough were the release of
Palestinian prisoners and the timetable for Israeli troop
redeployments in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians demand that Israel release 650 political
prisoners, those jailed for anti-Israel activities, but Israel
insists that it will release only 500 prisoners and will not free
those Palestinians involved in killings of Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Barak has proposed to postpone the last of the three stages of
troop withdrawals stipulated in the Wye accord until February next
year, when the two sides are supposed to have worked out a
framework for the final-status talks, which deal with thorny
issues like Jerusalem and Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians want Israel to complete all the troop
withdrawals at an earlier date in line with the original
timetable of the Wye accord, which calls on Israel to hand over 13
percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians in three stages over
a period of 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu carried out the first stage of the agreement late
last year before freezing it in a failed attempt to woo back
rebellious coalition partners opposed to territorial concession to
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Sher and Erekat resumed talks in Jerusalem Monday afternoon,
nearly 24 hours after Barak issued the ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
To help break the impasse, Osama el-Baz, senior adviser to
President Hosni Mubarak, continued shuttling between the Israeli
and Palestinian sides Monday, meeting respectively with Erekat and
Sher.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian envoy held separate talks with Arafat and Barak
Sunday night and Monday, but was unable to bridge the gaps. Israel
Radio said Israel had rejected el-Baz's compromise proposal
calling on Israel to release more Palestinian prisoners and to
further specify the timetable for the troop withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
Since Barak's taking office early last month on a pledge to
move forward the peace process with the Arab neighbors, Egypt has
increased its role in mediating the Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy accused the Palestinians
Monday of trying to create an atmosphere of crisis ahead of
Albright's visit by not agreeing to the Israeli proposals.
</P>
<P>
Barak has asked Washington to scale down its mediation role in
the peace process, but the Palestinians want the U.S. to continue
playing an active role.
</P>
<P>
Despite the current impasse, there were still signs that the
two sides were narrowing their gaps on the major issue of
Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by Barak's office Sunday night said
Israel would not release jailed members of Hamas or Islamic
Jihad, hinting that members of other Palestinian political groups
might be eligible for release.
</P>
<P>
Charging Barak of preparing to make concessions to the
Palestinians, former hawkish Israeli foreign minister Ariel Sharon
said Monday that Barak would be ready to release between 300 and
400 Palestinians "with Israeli bloods on their hands."

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli
Majko said here on Monday that the Albanian government considered
important its ties with Hungary.
</P>
<P>
Majko made this remark when he met Hungarian Prime Minister
Orban Viktor, who arrived here on Monday on a one-day visit to the
country.
</P>
<P>
This importance becomes more touchable as the two countries
</P>
<P>
are moving in the same direction according to the principles
set
</P>
<P>
in the Stability Pact for Southeast Europe.
</P>
<P>
It is the first visit of its kind since the 1960s as described
by Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli Majko, who urged the two
countries to develop their ties in various fields, especially the
bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Orban said that with the admission of Hungary into the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), his country paid special
attention to the developments in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need for strengthening economic ties
between Hungary and Albania.
</P>
<P>
Albanian President Rexhep Meidani Monday also met with Orban
and the two expressed the desire of both countries to reinforce
bilateral cooperation by exploiting all possible spaces.
</P>
<P>
During Orban's stay in Albania, the governments of the two
countries agreed to set up a joint economic commission in November
to promote bilateral trade.

<HEADLINE> IMF Sees No Russia's Money Laundering in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) said Monday it has put tight controls in place to
prevent its loans to Russia from being misused and has seen no
evidence of illegal diversions through U.S. banks.
</P>
<P>
Tom Dawson, director of external affairs at the IMF, said that
the lending agency has "absolutely no indication of any IMF money"
having been diverted through the Bank of New York or other U.S.
banks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in a conference call, Dawson said that
the IMF will continue to "take the allegations seriously."
</P>
<P>
An IMF team has been in Russia for several days and is
scheduled to return at the end of the week, Dawson said. "We
believe we are being open and transparent in terms of what's been
going on," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We just don't believe there are any grounds for this
particular accusation," Dowson added.
</P>
<P>
Reports said some of the 10 billion U.S. dollars allegedly
funneled through the Bank of New York by Russian gangsters in a
money-laundering scheme may have involved IMF loans to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. congressmen urged the IMF to halt its loans to Russia
until controls are put in place to prevent diversions of the sort
that reportedly have occurred through the Bank of New York.

<HEADLINE> E-Commerce Threat to UK Revenues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Internet shopping by Britons
could cost the Inland Revenue of the British Government up to 10
billion pounds (16 billion U.S. dollars) in lost taxes each year,
according to a report published on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The taxman is already missing out on possible VAT payments from
the huge amounts of music and software bought and downloaded
electronically from suppliers based overseas, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A report by the Institute of Directors (IoD) says that as the
Internet encourages more people to buy goods from overseas, the
tax shortfall will spiral. The report follows a survey from the
NOP research group, which found that the UK is undergoing an
e-commerce explosion.
</P>
<P>
It found that almost 1.5 million people in the UK shopped on
the Internet in the four weeks to 1 June this year, spending 239
million pounds (382 million U.S. dollars). This was a 44 percent
increase on the numbers identified in a similar survey in
December.
</P>
<P>
And spending on online shopping in the UK will rise from about
3 billion pounds (4.8 billion U.S.dollars) this year to about 9.5
billion pounds (16 billion U.S. dollars) by the end of 2001, NOP
suggested.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 30 (Xinhua) - Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa arrived in Sweden Monday for a six-day official
visit to the Scandinavian country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a banquet hosted by Swedish Prime Minister Goran
Persson in Stockholm, Mkapa expressed hopes that the two countries
could strengthen ties on the basis of long period of co-operation
and friendship, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian President is accompanied by his wife Anna Mkapa,
Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation Jakaya
Kikwete, Minister of Industries and Commerce, Iddi Simba, as well
as other senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics indicated that Tanzania's imports from
Sweden grew from 10.5 billion shillings (about 13 million U.S.
dollars) in 1997 to 18.7 billion shillings (about 23 million
dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
But Tanzania's exports to Sweden have been declining, reaching
about 900 million shillings (1.1 million dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Imports from Tanzania consisted of agricultural products, such
as coffee, tea, cocoa and spices. Dwindling export earnings of
agricultural products from Tanzania to Sweden are the result of
low export volumes caused by low production. Weather vagaries and
poor technology are the chief reason for this.
</P>
<P>
In the near future, there should be a potential for increased
revenues to Tanzania from Swedish tourists, according to a report
by the Dar es Salaam-based Business Times.
</P>
<P>
On investment and joint ventures, the report said that there
have already been quite a few investments and joint ventures
between Sweden and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
To promote joint ventures and direct investments on a more
partner-like basis, there are several instruments available
through the Swedish International Development Agency, and other
government or commercial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Sweden has been a major donor to Tanzania, providing assistance
to social and economic reforms as well as other sectors.

UNITED NATIONS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Monday demanded an immediate end to the violence against civilian
population in Kosovo, in particular against ethnic minorities in
the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press here, the president of the
Security Council for the month of August, Martin Andjaba of
Namibia, said, the council members "condemned violence against the
civilian population, in particular against ethnic minorities, as
well as against KFOR personnel." KFOR stands for the international
peacekeepers in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"They demanded that such acts cease immediately," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council reaffirmed the principle of respect for
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the FRY (the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia)," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after the 15-nation Security Council met in
a closed-door session to exchange views on the situation in
Kosovo, and the implementation of the Security Council Resolution
1244, adopted on June 10.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council reaffirmed the utmost importance of
full implementation of Security Council Resolution 1244 and
reiterated the need to comply fully with the demands of the
resolution and to cooperate fully with UNMIK (the U.N. Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo) and KFOR to this end," the
statement said.

The Security Council "called on Member States to provide UNMIK
with resources necessary to carry out its functions under Security

<HEADLINE> EU: SMEs Can Play Role in Technology Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) can play a significant role in bringing the
benefits of globalization to developing countries, especially in
the crucial area of technology transfer, a newly published study
said.
</P>
<P>
SMEs' flexibility allows them to adapt quickly to a volatile
market, and their diversity means they can exploit new niche
markets which larger firms would find uneconomical, said the
study, a working report for an expert panel of the European
Parliament, the supervisory and policy-making branch of the
European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The SMEs tend to be spread out more, which makes for more
balanced industrial development, and they have lower start-up
costs and can create jobs with a low capital investment, the report
added.
</P>
<P>
The study, which assessed the range of EU programs trying to
support SMEs in the developing world and link them with their
counterparts EU-wide, said that "all these and other factors allow
SMEs to go with the flow of recent economic trends, such as the
move to a knowledge-based market, and the growing need to keep up
with rapid innovation".
</P>
<P>
Referring to how the factors have supported "the importance of
horizontal networking between businesses and other economic actors
- which, again, favors SMEs", the report said this has had a
particular impact on technology transfer, which takes place less
and less through traditional ways and more through a transient web
of strategic alliances or temporary agreements.
</P>
<P>
The tide, it said, is moving in the direction of smaller firms.
"There are still obstacles, however, and it is these obstacles
which the EU's various support programs need to overcome. Many of
them are the flip side of the very advantages SMEs have in the
global market place."
</P>
<P>
The size of SMEs makes them flexible, but it can also mean that
they lack a long-term strategy, or that they can't control or
transfer the technology they use. "They find it harder to get
credit, and so have a greater sense of risk - which can make them
vulnerable and cautious," they therefore need the right kind of
support, the study said.
</P>
<P>
The EU report pointed out that the key to boosting technology
transfer between the industrialized and developing worlds is not
necessarily to back individual SMEs, but to try and stimulate the
growth of the systems of relations from which they can draw
resources because "technology transfer doesn't mean passing
hardware or expertise down the line".

<HEADLINE> AIDS Deaths Down in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Deaths from AIDS declined 20
percent in the United States between 1997 and 1998 due to the
effectiveness of new drugs, U.S. health officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures released at the national HIV
Prevention Conference in Atlanta Monday, AIDS killed 17,047 people
in the United States last year, down from 21,222 in 1997. From
1996 to 1997, the drop in deaths was a much more dramatic 42
percent.
</P>
<P>
"As we anticipated, we are now seeing the first signs of a
slowing in this trend," said Dr. Helene Gayle, director of HIV
prevention for the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC).
</P>
<P>
"In a period of only two years, new combination therapies cut
the annual level of death in half," she said. "But for the time
being it appears that much of the benefit of these new therapies
has been realized."
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, more than 300,000 have died of AIDS in the
United States. In 1995, 49,351 people died from AIDS. By 1996,
that dropped to 36,792, and the number was down to 21,222 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
New HIV infections in 1998 were estimated at roughly 40,000
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Blacks, who make up about 13 percent of the population,
accounted for 49 percent of AIDS deaths in 1998 while 32 percent
of deaths were among whites and 18 percent among Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, organized by the CDC and 17 other
agencies, features 2,000 scientists, doctors, researchers and
advocates addressing efforts to monitor and prevent the spread of
HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says East Timor's Referendum a "Success" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Monday
called a referendum on the future of East Timor a success.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley told reporters that all
reports -- official and unofficial -- "indicate that the
U.N.-administered vote in East Timor was a success, with
approximately 90 percent of those registered casting ballots."
</P>
<P>
"This is really an extraordinary figure," he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the next phases of the process -- counting the
vote and transition to either independence or autonomy within
Indonesia -- Foley said: "Indonesia maintains the responsibility
for maintaining order and we remain concerned about the potential
for violence."
</P>
<P>
"In particular the government of Indonesia should prevent armed
militia from resuming their activities," he added.
</P>
<P>
Foley also said according to U.N. accounts, a number of polling
stations were temporarily closed but that did not prevent any
individual from voting.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Red Crescent Delegation to Visit Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi Red Crescent Society
has formed a delegation to visit Turkey to distribute 10 million
U.S. dollars worth of oil as assistance to the quake-hit country,
an Iraqi official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
President of the society Sadiq Hameed Aloosh told a press
conference that Iraq offered its oil as assistance because it has
no hard currency due to nine years of United Nations embargo,
imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Aloosh did not say when the delegation will leave for Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government on Sunday decided to offer 10 million
dollars worth of oil as assistance to families of victims of the
strong earthquake that recently hit Turkey.
</P>
<P>
An earthquake of 7.4 magnitude struck populous northwestern
Turkey on August 17, leaving some 14,000 people killed and 43,000
others injured so far. It was feared that the death toll would
break 40,000 as tens of thousands of people were still buried
under the rubble.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Red Crescent Society will coordinate with its
Turkish counterpart to draw up the distribution plan of the
assistance, said Aloosh.
</P>
<P>
Iraq had started pumping oil to Turkey on Sunday, adding that
it will pump 500,000 barrels of oil to Turkey in five days, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Rebels Launch Fresh Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Angolan rebels launched another
round of attack at the weekend, killing four, injuring many and
destroying a bridge, local media reported here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the north province of Lunda-norte, close to the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), rebels of the National Union for
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) ambushed civilian vehicles
in a stretch of road connecting the Fucauma village and the Zanji
Town, leaving four dead and another four severely injured.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses of the incident said that the action was launched
Saturday by well-equipped militants, in the uniform of DRC regular
forces, 90 kilometers east to Dundo, an important fortress held by
the government troops near the Angola-DRC border, said the news
agency Angop.
</P>
<P>
Military source in Dundo said that this is the fifth terrorist
act of its kind registered in the region in less than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
In the central-west Benguela province, a bridge over the Camoko
River, part of an important road linking the main cities of the
Lobito, Bocoio and Balombo provinces, was also destroyed by UNITA
rebels in this attack, said Angop.
</P>
<P>
According to a local government official, destroying
infrastructure is a habitual action of Jonas Savimbi, the UNITA
leader, for creating social crisis and forcing the government to
spend heavily on reconstructions.

<HEADLINE> S. African FM to Witness Congolese Accord Signing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 30 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Minister Nkosazana Zuma Monday left for Lusaka to witness
Tuesday's signing of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
cease-fire agreement by a major rebel group.
</P>
<P>
"The South African government hopes that the signing will take
place without any hitches, and that the implementation of the
peace process can start in earnest," South African Press
Association quoted Zuma as telling reporters in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said the signing should be followed within 24 hours by a
complete cease-fire. This would lead to the formation within seven
days of a joint military commission comprising all the warring
factions in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the commission would be an individual from
outside the countries involved in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The third step, Zuma said, would be the deployment of observers
from the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity
(OAU), probably also within a few days of the signing.
</P>
<P>
She said it could take months before peacekeeping troops are
sent to that country. The OAU and the United Nations would decide
which countries to invite to take part in the peacekeeping
exercise, and what kind of support they would be asked to render.
</P>
<P>
"Only then can we (South Africa) really say how our involvement
is going to be," Zuma said.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said that Burundi would be involved in steps to secure a
cease-fire in the DRC, as it shared the security concerns of
Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The major rebel group, the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD),
did not sign the July cease-fire agreement due to a squabble about
who would sign on its behalf.
</P>
<P>
Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, who was expelled from the rebel group
in May, has insisted on signing the document, while the current
leadership refused to sign if Wamba did.
</P>
<P>
It has since been agreed that all 51 founding members of the
rebel group would add their names to the peace accord, including
Wamba dia Wamba and current RCD leader Emile Ilunga.
</P>
<P>
The document has already been signed by DRC President Laurent
Kabila and his military allies Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, as
well as by Uganda and Rwanda -- who backed the rival rebel
factions in the year-long conflict.
</P>
<P>
Zuma would represent President Thabo Mbeki at the signing
ceremony.

JOHANNESBURG, August 30 (Xinhua) -- South African International
Trade Exhibition (Saitex) hopes to further stimulate growing trade
figures between South Africa and the rest of Africa, organizers
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Figures show that Africa is a major and growing export market
for us," said Saitex Director John Theron.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Pleased with East Timor Ballot Turnout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan expressed his satisfaction over the large turnout in
East Timor's ballot held as scheduled on Monday on its future
while calling for more security measures in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
Despite sporadic incidents, Annan paid tribute to the efforts
of the Indonesian authorities and particularly of the police on
the polling day when well over 90 percent of all registered voters
cast their ballots, Annan's spokesman stated on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
Describing the polling as smooth, Annan congratulated Portugal
and Indonesia for their "spirit of cooperation and collegiality"
during the polling process.
</P>
<P>
The referendum under an agreement among Indonesia, Portugal and
the United Nations was for voters to choose between special
autonomy within Indonesia or independence.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony annexed by Indonesia in
1976, has been seen by the United Nations General Assembly as a
non-self-governing territory.
</P>
<P>
The ballot, organized and conducted by the U.N. as ageed upon
by the parties, had been delayed twice because of violent
incidents by anti-independence and pro-independence activists in
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. recruited worker was murdered on the voting day.
</P>
<P>
"The role of the security forces will be even more important in
the coming days as ballot boxes are transported to the central
counting station and the count begins," Annan said, calling on all
local groups to exercise the utmost restraint and patience.
</P>
<P>
The sealed ballot boxes will be transported to Dili, the
capital by mid-day Tuesday and the process of counting,
verification and certification is expected to take a week before
the vote is announced, said Manoel de Almeida e Silva, Deputy
Spokesman for the U.N. Secretary-General.

<HEADLINE> Diabetes Breakthrough Could Lead to Cure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- A therapy for the commonest form
of diabetes could be on the horizon after a scientific
breakthrough, according to a study which was published in the
September edition of the journal Nature Medicine.
</P>
<P>
Type one diabetes sufferers cannot produce enough insulin, the
natural substance which controls the amount of glucose (sugar) in
the bloodstream. This is because cells in the body which produce
insulin have been damaged. And once the damage has taken place,
sufferers rely on injections of insulin to control their blood
sugar levels, without the daily injections, death is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
But British researcher Dr Susan Wong, working at Yale
University School of Medicine, believes she has found how cells
from the body's immune system attack and damage the cells.
</P>
<P>
This is considered an important step in finding ways to block
this, and produce a treatment, or possibly even a vaccine.
</P>
<P>
What Dr Wong's team have found is an molecule that can provoke
the body's defenses into an attack. It is hoped that eventually it
can given in the form of a treatment which will make the immune
system tolerant of it. Then the body will leave the
insulin-producing cells alone to do their job, and remove the need
for injections.
</P>
<P>
Diabetes experts from around the world have hailed the team's
findings. Dr Mark Peakman, from Kings College Hospital in London,
who is working on a similar project, said "I was excited when I
heard about this. It's a pretty amazing finding. "
</P>
<P>
"If you know what the targets are, there is a possibility of
developing a way of blocking the attack," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Peakman warned that such experimentation would demand great
care, as an extra supply of the molecule could provoke a massive
immune reaction.
</P>
<P>
Type I diabetes sufferers usually develop the condition as
children or young adults. If poorly controlled it can cause
blindness, stroke, kidney failure and amputation.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The High Court in Harare Monday
continued with their case against three Americans arrested for
being found in possession of arms of war.
</P>
<P>
These Americans are Joseph Pettijohn, John Dixon and Garry
Blanchard.
</P>
<P>
Pettijohn told the High Court that he agreed with the evidence
given by Charles Haley, a technician from the Forensic Department
of Zimbabwe Republic Police, that the weapons could be used in
offensive situations.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, although the weapons could be used for
assassination purposes, they had never thought of using them that
way.
</P>
<P>
Under cross examination by Prosecutor Joseph Musakwa, Pettijohn
 maintained that they had kept the weapons for self defense and
hunting opportunities.
</P>
<P>
He said they did not declare the weapons both in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo and Zimbabwe because they feared
confiscation.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe alleges that Pettijohn, Dixon and Blanchard were found
in possession of arms of war on March 7, this year at the Harare
International Airport, which is against the Aircraft Act and the
Law and Order Maintenance Act.
</P>
<P>
The case would continue next Tuesday.

International Exhibition Center, attracted more than 300,000 stamp
collectors from all over the country.
</P>
<P>
In addition to 3,322 sets of stamps from the world over, the
exhibition also offered rare stamps such as the Penny Black and
the Mauritius Post Office Stamp.
</P>
<P>
"The guards here are the most tired as 99 if not 100 percent of
visitors jostle to see Penny Black," said Shang Xiuwei, who
oversees security in the hall.
</P>
<P>
The Penny Black, issued by the United Kingdom in 1840, is the
envy of stamp collectors throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Only recently have Chinese stamp collectors paid attention to
foreign stamps, much less collected them.
</P>
<P>
"The trends are changing," said Xu Jihai, senior editor with
the People's Post and Telecommunications Publishing House, adding
that the change indicates the improvement of people's living
standards and the country's level of sophistication of stamp
collecting.

"As more people know more about the world and have more money,
it's natural they will be interested in buying foreign stamps," Xu
said.
</P>
<P>
Xu earns several thousand yuan a month; an entire set of stamps
costs only several hundred yuan.
</P>
<P>
"I still remember when I was in school, my living expense for a
month was 20 yuan, but a set of stamps sometimes cost one half or
one third of that."
</P>
<P>
Crowds surrounded the stands where dealers from 67 countries
sold stamps and other mail-related items.
</P>
<P>
"If Black Penny were auctioned, many stamp collectors here would
have bought it," said a stamp buyer at the Russian stamp stand who
didn't give his name.
</P>
<P>
China currently has 20 million stamp collectors -- the largest
contingent of stamp collectors in the world. In 1998, the country'
s total revenue from philately reached 7.79 billion yuan,
accounting for 14 percent of the postal business volume.
</P>
<P>
"In China, stamp collecting only existed in the old days for
very few people," said Knud Mohr, President of the Federation of
International Philately. "Now, everybody is given the opportunity
to collect stamps. It's very impressive. "

BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Editor's note: This year is the
50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
Over the past half century, China's achievements have attracted
worldwide attention, with comprehensive national strength
increasing and earthshaking changes occurring in all sectors.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua News Agency will release about 20 articles on these
developments and provide the latest information on the nation's
economy. The first of the series was released on August 17. This
is the tenth.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, the total length of China's various
communications means, including airways, railways, highways and
river navigation, had hit 2.97 million kilometers, 16.4 times the
figure in 1949, when New China was founded.
</P>
<P>
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics show that the
country's railway length currently reaches 57,600 km, an increase
of 1.6 times compared to 1949, with that of river navigation,
highway and civil aviation standing at 110,000 km, 1.27 million km,
and 1.5 million km.

<HEADLINE> Professor: Smoking for 20 Years Causes Lung Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Smoking for 20 years are enough
to cause lung cancer, which is among the main causes of death in
the world, a Greek university professor said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kostas Zarogoulidis, professor for pulmonary disease at
Greece's Aristotle University, said at a press conference in the
northern Greek city of Thessaloniki that the risk of developing
lung cancer increases 7 times if a person smokes 13 cigarettes a
day, while 20 cigarettes a day make the risk 10 times higher, the
Macedonian Press Agency (MPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
There is a five percent likelihood for the disease to appear in
passive smokers, he added.
</P>
<P>
The professor said that in Europe, lung cancer appears in men
at a 6 to 1 ratio compared to women because women smoke less.
</P>
<P>
The lack of symptoms offering an early warning to the patients
is the main cause for the increased number of deaths by lung
cancer compared to other cancer types, he said, adding that in
Europe only 1 out 3 is diagnosed with the disease when it is at
its early stages, while in Greece the ratio is 1 out of 7.
</P>
<P>
However, he continued that even those who are diagnosed early
show a low survival rate because 80 percent of the lung cancer
types are very resistant to chemotherapy and 40 percent do not
respond to X-ray treatment.

GENEVA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The 1999 United Nations Program
of Fellowships on Disarmament started here Monday at the UN Office
43
at Geneva with the participation of young diplomats from 26 UN
member states.
</P>
<P>
During their 10-week study, the diplomats will attend lectures
by senior representatives of states members of the Conference on
Disarmament in Geneva and delegations to the First Committee of
the General Assembly in New York, and by staff members of the
Department for Disarmament Affairs, according to a UN press
release.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they will have the opportunity to observe sessions
of the Conference on Disarmament, the Ad Hoc Group of the States
Parties to the Biological Weapons Convention and the First
Committee of the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats will also travel to various cities around the
world. When the program ends on November 3 at the UN Headquarters
in New York, the young diplomats will be awarded certificates of
participation there.

With the competition between them becoming more fierce, they
must improve speed and efficiency to hold on to their market share
and attract more customers, said Zhao Yongzheng, a professor with
the Institute of Comprehensive Transportation of the State
Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
She added that a high-speed integrated communications network
not only aids the industry itself, but also the growth of China's
economy.
</P>
<P>
China's first expressway, completed in Shanghai on October 31,
1988, is 18.5 kilometers long.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, that length reached 8,733 kilometers. The
country expects to have 9,000 kilometers of expressways by next
year and 21,600 kilometers by 2020.
</P>
<P>
To meet the challenge of the rapidly-developed expressway,
China's railway, which used to be the leader of the communications
sector, is taking steps to enhance its service.
</P>
<P>
Shen Zhijie, former chief engineer of the Ministry of Railways,
said the development of a high-speed railway is necessary. The
ministry raised railway speeds in 1997 and 1998, Shen said.

The country planned to build its first high-speed railway
between Beijing and Shanghai in 2000, with a designed speed of 300
kilometers per hour. It also succeeded in testing its fastest
train, with a high speed of 200 km per hour, on July 8, 1999.
</P>
<P>
China's civil aviation, another high-speed means of transport,
has also enjoyed rapid growth in the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
The country had just 29 airplanes and seven air routes in 1949,
with a gross turnover standing at 1.57 million ton kilometers. Now
it has had 485 airplanes, 851 domestic routes and 109
international routes, with a gross turnover of 9.2 billion
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
From 1949 to 1978, China had 78 airports, most of which were
middle-and small-sized. The figure increased to 141 in 1997, 17 of
which could handle Boeing 747s.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Qihua, an expert from the Water
Transportation Institute under the Ministry of Communications,
China's high-speed water transportation, which mainly occurs on
the Yangtze River and offshore shipping routes, is also playing an
important role in the country's communications system.
</P>
<P>
He named some major routes, such as Dalian-Yantai, Shanghai-
Ningbo and Shenzhen-Hong Kong, which mainly use hovercrafts
sailing at an average speed of 60 to 70 kilometers per hour.

<HEADLINE> Leader of Congolese Rebel Backs Truce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Leader of a Congolese rebel
faction said his forces would stop fighting after the signing of
the ceasefire accord and begin talks to create a new political
order in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Emile Ilunga, leader of the main group of the now splintered
Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) said here on Monday he
reluctantly backed the truce to be signed in the Zambian capital
Lusaka on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to sign the ceasefire tomorrow. We are signing
not as a matter of weakness but to give peace a chance in our
country and to allow for the creation of a new political order
through political dialog," Ilunga said.
</P>
<P>
But in Kigali, Lambert Mende, a spokesman for Ilunga's faction,
said the peace would be short-lived unless major democratic
reforms, including the removal of President Laurent Kabila from
power, were implemented.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's event will be overseen by regional foreign ministers,
the United Nations and Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, who
has acted as a mediator in the conflict in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Six African countries directly involved in the conflict signed
a peace agreement on July 10 in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
The rebel groups could not sign the pact because of internal
leadership wrangles in RCD while the other rebel group, the
Movement for the Liberation of the Congo (MLC) led by Pierre
Bemba, signed the agreement early this month.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Zambian Presidential Affairs Minister Eric Silwamba
said the arrival of the RCD leader was positive indication that
all the other stake- holders would be in Lusaka for the signing
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Silwamba, who just returned from Rwanda, Uganda and Eastern
Congo (K) as Chiluba's special envoy where he had gone to verify
who led the trouble- torn RCD.
</P>
<P>
The stand-off in the rebel group was between Ilunga, supported
by Rwanda and Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, supported by Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Silwamba disclosed that all the 50 founding members of the RCD
would append their signatures to the ceasefire deal which is
expected to strengthen the fragile agreement sign by the six
regional states last month.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources close to the rebel told Xinhua by telephone,
Wamba dia Wamba has just arrived in Lusaka Monday afternoon for
the signing ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Barak Abandons Ultimatum on Israeli-Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak abandoned an ultimatum to the Palestinians Monday, saying he
expected answers from Palestinian leaders within three days to his
proposed modification of a U.S.-brokered peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Briefing a parliamentary committee of foreign and defense
affairs, Barak said it would be known within three days whether
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat would agree
to Israeli proposals on the implementation of the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
"The prospects (for an agreement), I believe, are more than
50-50," Barak told reporters after the briefing.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that if Arafat rejects the modification to the
agreement, Israel would carry it out "by the book," or according
to Israeli interpretation, which analysts said would harm further
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
</P>
<P>
His extension of deadline was a retreat from an ultimatum he
issued Sunday night to the Palestinians after the negotiations hit
a snag over the release of Palestinian prisoners and the timetable
for a final Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his office, Barak threatened to halt
the negotiations and to implement the Wye agreement according to
Israeli interpretation if the Palestinians did not give
"satisfactory answers" within "the coming hours". Israeli sources
said the "coming hours" means until Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said the prime minister spoke with Arafat by
telephone Monday, but failed to break the current deadlock. The
deadline passed without any signs of Palestinian backing down.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have hoped to reach an agreement over the Wye
implementation before United States Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright starts a visit to the region on September 1 and to hold a
signing ceremony in Cairo, Egypt Thursday at her presence.
</P>
<P>
The main issues blocking a breakthrough were the release of
Palestinian prisoners and the timetable for Israeli troop
redeployments in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians demand that Israel release 650 political
prisoners, those jailed for anti-Israel activities, but Israel
insists that it will release only 500 prisoners and will not free
those Palestinians involved in killings of Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Barak has proposed to postpone the last of the three stages of
troop withdrawals stipulated in the Wye accord until February next
year, when the two sides are supposed to have worked out a
framework for the final-status talks, which deal with thorny
issues like Jerusalem and Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians want Israel to complete all the troop
withdrawals at an earlier date in line with the original timetable
of the Wye accord, which calls on Israel to hand over 13 percent
of the West Bank to the Palestinians in three stages over a period
of 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
Barak's hard-line predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu, who signed
the agreement with Arafat in October last year, carried out the
first stage of the agreement before freezing it in a failed
attempt to woo back rebellious coalition partners opposed to
territorial concession to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Barak's envoy Gilad Sher and senior Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat resumed talks in Jerusalem Monday afternoon, nearly
24 hours after Barak issued the ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
To help break the impasse, Osama el-Baz, senior adviser to
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, continued shuttling between the
Israeli and Palestinian sides Monday, meeting respectively with
Erekat and Sher.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian envoy held separate talks with Arafat and Barak
Sunday night and Monday, but was unable to bridge the gaps. Israel
Radio said Israel had rejected el-Baz's compromise proposal
calling on Israel to release more Palestinian prisoners and to
further specify the timetable for the troop withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
Since Barak's taking office early last month on a pledge to
move forward the peace process with the Arab neighbors, Egypt has
increased its role in mediating the Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy accused the Palestinians
Monday of trying to create an atmosphere of crisis ahead of
Albright's visit by not agreeing to the Israeli proposals.
</P>
<P>
Barak has asked Washington to scale down its mediation role in
the peace process, but the Palestinians want the U.S. to continue
playing an active role.
</P>
<P>
Despite the current impasse, there were still signs that the
two sides were narrowing their gaps on the major issue of
Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by Barak's office Sunday night said
Israel would not release jailed members of Hamas or Islamic
Jihad, hinting that members of other Palestinian political groups
might be eligible for release.
</P>
<P>
Charging Barak of preparing to make concessions to the
Palestinians, former hawkish Israeli foreign minister Ariel Sharon
said Monday that Barak would be ready to release between 300 and
400 Palestinians "with Israeli bloods on their hands."

<HEADLINE> General: Blockade of Russian Peacekeepers in Kosovo Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 30 (Xinhua) -- A ranking Russian officer said
Monday that the blockade by Kosovar Albanians to prevent Russian
peacekeepers from entering Orahovac was "a thoroughly-planned
provocation" and a revenge on Russia for its march on Pristina
ahead of NATO troops in June.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians have maintained the roadblocks for a week and
talks to end the standoff have so far been fruitless.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant-General Nikolai Staskov, chief of staff of the
Russian airborne units, urged the NATO political leaders to exert
pressure on the Kosovar Albanians, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that "reason will prevail and our
peacekeepers will enter Orahovac without incident."
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that if attacked by Kosovars, "our
peacekeepers are prepared to use their weapons in self-defense."
</P>
<P>
The most important thing is "not to give in to provocation, in
as much as the operation will be jeopardized if there is
bloodshed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russian soldiers are scheduled to begin taking over from Dutch
troops as peacekeepers in Orahovac, about 40 kilometers southwest
of the provincial capital Pristina, but an advance party was
forced to turn back last Monday at one of the roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
About 3,600 Russians form part of the more than 40,000-strong
NATO-led Kosovo peacekeeping force (KFOR).

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Asks Albright to End Israeli Aggression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Defense Minister Ghazi
Zuetir Monday asked the U.S. State of Secretary Madeleine Albright
to pressure Israel to end its daily aggression on the country.
</P>
<P>
Zuetir told the independent Central News Agency that Israel
usually escalates the situation in south Lebanon ahead of any
international envoy's visit to the region for reactivation of the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
He added that Israeli's current aggression, which is aimed at
forcing Lebanon and Syria to accept its peace conditions, came
just before Albright kicks off her five-day tour to the region.
</P>
<P>
Albright will make her first visit to the Middle East later
this week since Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak took power in
July after ousting his hardline predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The minister called on Albright to help end the warfare in
south Lebanon by exerting pressure on Israel and pushing it to the
commitment to international laws.
</P>
<P>
On the weekend, tensions have been on the rise when Lebanese
guerrillas and Israeli troops escalated their fighting in the
Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Six Lebanese civilians were wounded and a Hezbollah fighter
killed during the fire exchange.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting
to oust Israeli troops out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Member Convicted of Directing Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 30 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli military court on
Monday convicted a member of the Islamic militant group Hamas of
masterminding two suicide bombings in downtown Jerusalem in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors asked the judges to give 24-year-old Ammar
al-Zibben 21 consecutive life-imprisonment sentences corresponding
to the number of Israelis killed in the two attacks.
</P>
<P>
The attacks were carried out by five Hamas suicide bombers at a
main open market and a popular pedestrian mall in the city.
</P>
<P>
Al-Zibben, from the West Bank town of Nablus, was arrested in
January 1998. The indictment said that he had served in the
Palestinian National Authority police force while being a member
of an underground Hamas cell.
</P>
<P>
He was also found guilty by the court of other operations,
including producing explosives and shooting at Israeli settlers,
Israeli radio reports said. Verdict for these convictions will be
handed down later this year.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, which opposes the Israeli-Palestinian peace making, has
killed scores of Israelis in a series of attacks it staged in
Israel since the signing of the historic Oslo peace accords in
1993.
</P>
<P>
Israel's security facilities have warned recently that Hamas
and other militant groups might renew terrorist attacks against
Israel as the stalled peace process was back on the track.

first half of 1999 saw a fairly robust growth in China's economy
and this has proved the effectiveness of China's pro-active fiscal
policy to stimulate the domestic demand and indicated China's
economy is able to withstand external shocks.
</P>
<P>
Jin made the point while briefing the two-day Fifth Meeting of
Finance and Central Bank Deputies under the Manila Framework
Group, which ended Monday.
</P>
<P>
Jin said in the first six months of 1999, China's investment
made by the state sector in major infrastructure projects grew
15.1 percent over the same period last year, the GDP expanded by
7.6 percent year-on-year and the growth in value added in the
industrial sector was 9.4 percent with encouraging efficiency
gains.
</P>
<P>
This has reflected the effectiveness of the pro-active fiscal
policy put in place last year to stimulate the domestic demand and
indicated the implementation of the macroeconomic policy of 1999
which is giving priority to the work to maintain a stable growth
of the economy, Jin said.
</P>
<P>
Jin noted the lingering yet still strong contagion effect of
the Asian financial crisis on the economy is a cause of concern,
which is most acutely felt in the external sector.
</P>
<P>
He referred to the 2.8 percent drop in China's export in the
first seven months of this year compared with the same period last
year. But Jin pointed out that China's export in July showed a
sharp turnaround, registering an increase of 7.5 percent over the
same month of last year.
</P>
<P>
Jin said, "We need to increase treasury bonds issuance to keep
investment going in major infrastructure projects and technical
upgrading for promising enterprises which have a good market share
for their products."
</P>
<P>
Affirming that the Chinese government will continue its
pro-active fiscal policy, Jin said the Chinese government is
dealing with the top priorities on its agenda, namely, state-owned
enterprise restructuring, banking sector reform and social
security reform.
</P>
<P>
On China's currency exchange policy, Jin said as a responsible
member of the international community as well as the Asian region,
the Chinese government remains committed to maintaining the
exchange rate stability of RMB.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of Finance and Central Bank Deputies under
the Manila Frame Group was convened in November 1997 when
representatives from 14 Asian economies as well as from the IMF,
the World Bank and Asian Development Bank met to discuss ways to
deal with the Asian financial crisis. The fifth meeting was held
in Singapore from August 29 to 30, 1999, with the participation of
representatives from Australia, Brunei, Canada, China, Hong Kong
SAR, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and the United States. The Bank
for International Settlement participated in the Singapore meeting
and it was the first time that the institution was represented at
the meeting of this catalogue.

<HEADLINE> African Finance Officials Discuss on Debt Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 30 (Xinhua) -- A high-level seminar opened here
Monday to discuss and seek a lasting solution to Africa's debt
problem, which has long hindered the development of the
continent.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the seminar is on the magnitude and effect of
Africa's debt problems, the role of foreign aid, sustainable
development and lessons of the Asian financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
 Botswanan President Festus G. Mogae said at the opening
ceremony, "the task at this meeting is an important and daunting
one: to come up solutions for the African debt problem." He
added, "The solution should reflect African needs and be
acceptable to the international financial community. "
</P>
<P>
He also noted that African countries should be realistic and
not expect unconditional debt write-offs.
</P>
<P>
"Africa currently faces an external debt of more than 285
million U.S. dollars, representing more than 200 percent of own
exports," said Mogae, also chairman of the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Among those attending the two-day conference are finance
ministers and governors of central banks from 18 African
countries, representatives from Japan, Britain, the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Actual debt service payments account for nearly one fourth of
governments' annual revenues and exceed annual expenditure on
health spending in 23 sub-Saharan African countries, according to
a report by United Nations Development Program.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Oil Sector Conquers Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Angola's petroleum industry has
resolved 95% of its potential Y2K problems as the new millennium
draws near, Angolan Vice-Minister of Science and Technology said
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Pedro Sebastiao Teta was quoted by official radio station Radio
Nacional de Angola (RNA) as saying that the country's
petroliferous sector is in a state of "95% conformation" in
relation to the potential Y2K problems arising from shortsighted
design.
</P>
<P>
The reason for this progress is that the petroliferous
companies operating in Angola have been benefitting from
information exchanges and guarantees of their equipment providers,
Teta said.
</P>
<P>
But Teta expressed his anxiety for the financial sector, saying
that the government is worrying about the Y2K problems which may
affect the countability, salary processing, pension calculation,
bank transference and international banking business.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that thanks to an agreement signed with the World
Bank on the modernization of the country's information system,
changes and replacements of computers of the Angolan banks are
underway.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian-Kuwaiti Talks to Focus on Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's King Abdullah Bin
Hussein, who is expected to be here for an official visit early
next month, will focus his talks with Kuwaiti leaders on ways of
strengthening bilateral ties, Jordan's new ambassador to Kuwait
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the two countries will also discuss means of
upgrading bilateral cooperation in various fields, said Mohammed
Al-Mufdhi Al-Qaraan, who was appointed on Sunday as Jordan's first
ambassador to Kuwait since the 1991 Gulf war triggered by Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
King Abdullah is scheduled to make his first visit to Kuwait on
September 6, according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming summit between Kuwait and Jordan will also touch
upon a number of issues of mutual concern, the situation in the
region and the Middle East peace process, Al-Qaraan said in an
interview with the official Kuwait news agency.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian diplomat stated that the current circumstances
are ready for the restoration of relations between Jordan and
Kuwait to the level before the Iraqi occupation. But he did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Jordan were estranged from each other after Amman
showed apparent sympathy with Iraq during the 1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
Jordan reopened its embassy in Kuwait last March, during an
official visit here by Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul Ilah
Al-Khatib, marking a normalization of ties between the two Arab
nations.
</P>
<P>
There were reports that Kuwait has named its ambassador to
Amman, but the reports have not been officially confirmed.

<P>
ATHENS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Montenegrin President
Milo Djukanovic held talks here Monday with Greek Foreign Minister
George Papandreou on the developments in the Balkans and relations
between Montenegro and Serbia.
</P>
<P>
The two men also discussed possibilities for the upgrade of
bilateral relations, closer relations between Montenegro and the
European Union (EU), as well as the democratization of Serbia and
the relations of Serbia with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after their talks, Djukanovic voiced his satisfaction
over the talks and relations between Greece and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
As for Montenegro's relations with Serbia, the president said
that Montenegro hoped for the re-establishment of its relations
with Serbia, based on the platform Montenegro had proposed.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Montenegro wanted to maintain the unity of
Yugoslavia, but its relationship with Serbia should allow for the
autonomous development of Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
Montenegro, one of Yugoslavia's two republics, has reportedly
proposed a new relationship with Serbia, which includes a separate
currency, defense and Foreign Ministries.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Djukanovic will meet with Greek Prime Minister
Costas Simitis.

<HEADLINE> 11 Countries Contribute Military Observers to UNOMSIL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
has agreed with a proposal by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
that 11 countries be added to the list of Member States
contributing military personnel to the United Nations Observer
Mission in Sierra Leone (UNOMSIL).
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Annan, which was published here Monday, the
president of the Security Council for the month of August, Martin
Andjaba of Namibia, said that the council members agreed with the
proposals contained in the letter from the Secretary-General.
</P>
<P>
The 11 additional countries are Croatia, the Czech Republic,
Denmark, France, Indonesia, Nepal, Norway, Sweden, Thailand,
Tanzania and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council on August 20 authorized tripling the size
of UNOMSIL to help carry out a recent peace accord signed by the
Sierra Leonean Government and rebels in Lome, capital of Togo.
</P>
<P>
The increase to 210 military officers from 70 is the first step
toward a larger peacekeeping presence in the west African country
following the July 7 agreement between President Ahmad Kabbah and
Foday Sankoh, head of the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF).
</P>
<P>
Although UNOMSIL has an authorized strength of 70, only about
50 military observers were deployed by the time when the Security
Council adopted the resolution on August 20. They were from 13
countries, including China, Egypt, Jordan, Kenya, New Zealand,
Russia and the United Kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Place Patrol Police in Streets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will place patrol police in
Greater Cairo in mid-September as part of the efforts to help
combat crimes and enhance stability, the interior minister said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Habib el-Adli told reporters that the patrol police system will
be applied on an experimental basis in the governorates of Cairo,
Giza and Qaliubia in the first stage.
</P>
<P>
It will later be expanded in other governorates after acquiring
experiences, el-Adli said.
</P>
<P>
"Stability already exists. It is to be strengthened," the
minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
Each group of the patrol police will consist of an officer and
four policemen, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported. Its work
will be to support the security forces in the streets.
</P>
<P>
The policemen have received extensive training and will be
equipped with up-to-date communications equipment, cars and
motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
They will be under a special command at the Ministry of
Interior and under the direct responsibility of the security
directorates.

<HEADLINE> Urgent Aid Appealed for Sudan Hit By Fresh Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The International Federation of
Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies Monday warned donors that
more than 100,000 people are now in urgent of assistance as new
flooding worsens in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Federation had launched a 1.2-million-Swiss franc appeal to
support relief operations as flash floods spread to While Nile
State and destroyed another 800 houses, bringing the total number
of homes affected in nine states to over 20,000.
</P>
<P>
The Federation's Regional Delegation in the Kenyan capital
Nairobi said Monday in a media release that severe August
flooding has been caused by unusually heavy rains, with the level
of major rivers in the country exceedingly high for the time of
year.
</P>
<P>
So far, Khartoum State has suffered most, followed by River
Nile, North Kordofan, White Nile, Northern State and Sinnar, and
some 40 people are known to have died in flooding, said the
release.
</P>
<P>
Immediate needs of flood victims are shelter, blankets, medial
 intervention and access to clean water, the Federation said,
adding its appeal for urgent relief aid will strengthen a
Sudanese Red Crescent operation with limited in-country
resources.
</P>
<P>
Red Crescent workers are extremely concerned by deteriorating
health in stricken communities as diarrhoea disease is increasing
rapidly, helped by contaminated stagnant water.
</P>
<P>
Sprayers, chemicals and medical supplies are also urgently
required as flood water provides prime breeding sites for
mosquitoes, causing malaria among the victim, added the release.

NAIROBI, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan Vice-President Paul
Kagame has reiterated Rwanda's commitment to the Lusaka accord,
saying that his country would pull its troops out of the Congo
immediately, if any one take up the responsibility to grant Rwanda
security.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the parliamentarians on Wednesday, Kagame, also the
defense minister, said the recent battle between Rwandan and
Uganda forces in Kisangani was a ''shame'' of the two friendly
countries, Rwandan News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the news agency, Kagame refused to comment on
allegations that Rwanda was the aggressor and had the intention to
oust rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba and his faction.
</P>
<P>
Kagame said the relations between Rwanda and Uganda have not
been affected by the Kisangani incidents, adding that leaders of
both countries are trying to investigate the cause and put in
place mechanisms so that the tragedy would not reoccur.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Back Informal Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 30 (Xinhua) - Tanzanian Vice-President
Omar Ali Juma said here Monday that informal sector should be
encouraged to create job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Juma said stringent conditions on loans from banks and
financial institutions have hindered the development of the
informal sector.
</P>
<P>
The terms are also holding back poor people from improving
their economic situation, Juma said while launching the Jobs for
Africa Program (JFA) for Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The program is designed by the International Labor Organization
(ILO) and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) to
implement an investment led growth strategy for employment
creation and poverty elimination.
</P>
<P>
The program, designed as a vehicle towards responding needs of
African countries to tackle their unemployment and poverty
problems, covers 16 countries.
</P>
<P>
The vice president pointed out that inadequate education is
another element that hinders the growth of the sector.
</P>
<P>
Juma called on JFA to look into the issue of credit schemes and
soft loans arrangement for the sector, as well as enhancement of
skills and use of technology in employment and poverty
eradication.
</P>
<P>
He said that the development of the sector would lead to a
creation of employment opportunities, especially self-employment
opportunities for young people.
</P>
<P>
The sector, he said, can also absorb the majority of poor
people, particularly women, who feature prominently among the
unemployed people.

<HEADLINE> One Killed as Bandits Ambush Lorry in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 30 (Xinhua) -- A group of armed bandits
have ambushed a lorry in a district in northwest Tanzania's Kagera
Region, killing a man, injuring two others and taking away cash
and properties.
</P>
<P>
Kagera Regional Police Commander, Eliuko Elihaki, said Monday
that the lorry was ambushed while ascending a hill along
Rusahunga-nyakahula road in Biharamulo district at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The police commander said one of the suspects who was armed
with a sub- machine gun, fired bullets at the tires forcing the
driver Amani Tamim to stop.
</P>
<P>
 After the lorry stopped, five other bandits who were armed
with machetes jumped out of the bush and forced the passengers to
get off and hand over to them everything they had, Elihaki said.
</P>
<P>
He said one passenger, Ally Msumba, tried to disarm a bandit a
machete but was shot on the stomach by another bandit. The man
died on the spot.
</P>
<P>
Two other people in the lorry sustained injuries and have been

<HEADLINE> Canada Announces Softwood Settlement With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Canadian International Trade
Minister Pierre Pettigrew Monday announced the settlement over a
softwood lumber dispute with the United States.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said, "I'm pleased that we have reached an
agreement, the resolution of which will allow B.C. lumber
producers to continue to perform strongly."
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, the two countries signed a settlement, under
which British Columbia's upper rate lumber exports to the United
States are limited to 110 million board feet.
</P>
<P>
Other limitations include the repricing of a certain amount of
lumber from the lower rate to the upper rate, which means that
B.C. lumber exporters will have to bear increased burdens of
stumpage fees.
</P>
<P>
The settlement will affect about 1 percent of B.C.'s total
lumber exports to the United States, while Alberta, Ontario and
Quebec, the other three dominant Canadian lumber export provinces,
will maintain their export allocation levels, according to
government sources.
</P>
<P>
The dispute began in January 1998, when the B.C. government
decided to reduce timber stumpage rates to offset the burden on
B.C. companies.
</P>
<P>
The United States accused Canada of breaching the Softwood
Lumber Agreement between the two countries.

<P>
MAPUTO, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano Monday officially launched the second phase of the
country's 1999 anti- polio vaccination campaign in the Maputo
suburb of Chamanculo.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Chamanculo crowd, Chissano urged the entire
Mozambican population to cooperate with the health services in the
quest to eradicate poliomyelitis.
</P>
<P>
He called on all adults to take their children aged under five
to the vaccination brigades.
</P>
<P>
Chissano also symbolically launched the campaign by
administering the oral vaccine to some of the children waiting
there.
</P>
<P>
Mocambique's health authorities believe that the country may be
awarded by the World Health Organization (WHO) the certificate as
free from polio by the year 2000 if the current vaccination
efforts keep going.
</P>
<P>
According to Health Minister Aurelio Zilhao, the coverage of
the first- phase vaccination campaign, which was launched between
July 26-30, reached some 114 percent of the target figure.
</P>
<P>
For the second phase, the authorities are paying special
attention to Maputo and other areas falling below the average
coverage rate in July.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Rebel Leader to Return Freetown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's former rebel leader
Foday Sankoh said on Monday that he was ready to return home and
take up his post as vice-president in a national unity government
as agreed in the July 7 peace accord.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark when international community is urging him
to move back to Freetown to facilitate the country's fragile peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh said in Togo's capital Lome that he had said farewell to
Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema and would leave for Sierra
Leone via Ivory Coast, possibly within hours, according to reports
reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
An advance party of aides led by former Sierra Leone Foreign
Minister Paulo Bangura was already in Freetown to prepare for his
arrival.
</P>
<P>
"I will be leaving here within the next few days or even hours.
I met President Eyadema today to say good-bye," said the leader
of the former rebel organization, the Revolutionary United Front
(RUF).
</P>
<P>
The peace agreement signed in July 7 in Lome canceled a death
sentence hanging over Sankoh and appointed him a vice-president.
</P>
<P>
But Sankoh had expressed concern about his own security in the
light of persistent opposition in Sierra Leone to a blanket
amnesty for him and his former fighters.
</P>
<P>
The RUF and its allies have been accused of widespread
atrocities in the country*s nine-year-long civil war. "We're not
going for a marriage party, so we have to take great care," said
Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
According to another report, the long- suffering S. Leoneans
who took refuge in Northern Liberia were compelled to embark on
another pilgrim for safety, as a result of the severe fighting
between Liberian government forces and its rebels.
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 S. Leonean refugees have left the town of Kolahun
in northern Lofa County for Targbe, about 30 miles to the south,
according to a UN High Commissioner for Refugees statement
reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The statement first released in Ivory Coast said that the
refugees were worried assistance would not reach them in Kolahun
after aid workers were evacuated during fighting near the borders
with Guinea and Sierra Leone that broke out Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian government says it has regained control over most
of the county, and the United Nations plans to send a mission in
the next few days to assess whether it is safe for aid agencies
to resume operations there.
</P>
<P>
About 35,000 Sierra Leoneans live in camps in Lofa County,
including 10, 000 who have stayed in Kolahun despite the fighting.
</P>
<P>
More than a million refugees fled Sierra Leone during its
nine-year civil war. Most of the refugees have not yet returned
to their home country,
</P>
<P>
after the signing of the Lome peace agreement.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Optimistic About Congolese Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Congolese peace process
would be further enforced with all the rebel forces' endorsement
of the Lusaka cease- fire agreement, Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni said here Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
With the opposing factions of the rebel group the Congolese
Rally for Democracy (RCD) signing the accord on Tuesday, the
splintered armies would become friends with common enemies, the
president said while addressing the Parliament on the issue of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Uganda is happy with the reconciliation of the rebel groups and
hopes that they will take the implementation of the peace pact
seriously, he added.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said that a political committee comprising the foreign
 ministers of the players in the DRC issue would meet to discuss
the implementation of the Lusaka agreement following the rebels'
inking it.
</P>
<P>
When asked by some MPs about the pullout of Ugandan army from
the DRC, the president said that with the implementation of the
Lusaka agreement, the armed forces there would become
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Uganda's army presence in the DRC is for
security reasons, instead of economic ones as previously rumored
in some press reports.
</P>
<P>
On the recent clashes between Ugandan and Rwandan forces in
Kisangani, the third largest city in the DRC, he attributed it to
misunderstanding due to lack of communication. He, therefore,
stressed that the two armed forces there should strengthen
communication and trust each other.

WASHINGTON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Hurricane Dennis turned out
to sea Monday after sideswiping the shoreline with 180 kph gusts
and up to 20.3 centimeters of rain that flooded streets and left
50,000 houses without power in North Carolina State of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Dennis kicked up 10-meter waves as it moved past Cape Fear on
its way out toward the open Atlantic, but the storm was expected
to stall off the North Carolina coast and could threaten the U.S.
East Coast for several days.
</P>
<P>
The hurricane was blamed for two traffic deaths early Monday.
Property damage appeared to be light, with shingles blown off some
homes, according to the North Carolina State Division of Emergency
Management.
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, Dennis moved on a plodding course parallel to
the coasts of the Carolinas. Tens of thousands of residents and
tourists were evacuated from the barrier islands separated from
the mainland by roads that get swamped in storms.
</P>
<P>
On Monday afternoon, Dennis was 120 kilometers southeast of
Cape Hatteras, moving east-northeast at almost 32 kph with
sustained winds of nearly 145 kph, down from 170 kph in the
morning. A hurricane warning remained in effect for most of the

<HEADLINE> EU Report: "Orphan Drugs" Need "Foster Parents" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) now
proposes official regulatory status concerning drugs for
unprofitable diseases, known as "orphan" drugs, with full or
partial exemption fees, an exclusive marketing period of 10 years,
and help with clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
Euroabstracts, an EU publication, said in its August issue that
research on rare diseases will remain a priority under the EU's
fifth framework program for research and development.
</P>
<P>
Unprofitable diseases include those that are rare and those in
developing countries with no money to buy expensive medications.
</P>
<P>
"Producing affordable therapies for developing countries is
difficult, but for rare-disease sufferers there is more hope. By
changing legal constraints which affect profitability, we may
persuade pharmaceutical companies that rare diseases are worth
targeting," the EU said. It noted that the European parliament,
one of the EU branches, is tackling the issue.
</P>
<P>
The Euroabstracts said some EU member states, such as France,
Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Britain and Germany, have considered the
status of orphan drugs, but European harmonization and commercial
encouragement are lacking. So the EU needs to set up a kind of
protective mechanism for orphan drugs.
</P>
<P>
EU data shows that it costs an estimated 263 million U.S.
dollars to develop a new drug. If pharmaceutical companies cannot
sell cures to millions of people, they stand no chance of
recouping huge research costs, the EU study report said.
</P>
<P>
"So it's hardly surprising they concentrate on potential
best-sellers: drugs for heart disease, ulcers, diabetes,
Alzheimer's disease, the common cold," it said, adding the orphan
drugs are generally abandoned at birth.
</P>
<P>
Experts, however, do not believe rare diseases mean few
sufferers. They pointed out that the label "rare" is usually taken
to mean that a disease affects fewer than 7.5 people per 10,000.
This includes well-known scourges such as multiple sclerosis,
which affects some 500,000 people in Europe. The World Health
Organization estimates that there are around 5,000 rare diseases
in the world, affecting 20 million people.
</P>
<P>
Rare diseases can be difficult to diagnose because doctors tend
to be unfamiliar with them. They are also hard to cure: 50 to 80
percent are genetic in origin and require high-tech remedies such
as gene therapy rather than traditional organic chemistry. But EU
experts said most of the investment needed for gene therapy will
be in the development of basic techniques which serve as a
platform for other threatments.
</P>
<P>
In the matter of fact, basic research and development costs for
orphan drugs are much the same as for any other drugs. "To make
orphan drugs commercially attractive, something else will have to
change," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the situation in the United States, Japan and
Australia, the EU said their experience in lowering various
barriers should be learned because things in the three countries
show that orphan drugs can be profitable and the key is the
wholehearted "foster parents" for orphan drugs.

<HEADLINE> Sixth Teenager Ordered to Leave N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- More death threats - allegedly by
the Irish Republican Army - were made against young people this
weekend after four youths were ordered to leave Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Police said on Monday the sixth and the latest IRA target was a
19-year-old Roman Catholic teenager who had been ordered out of
the British province within 24 hours after being attacked with an
iron bar or golf club.
</P>
<P>
Four other teenagers left Northern Ireland at the weekend after
receiving death threats.
</P>
<P>
A fifth death threat and expulsion order was issued to a
15-year-old boy on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The pro-British Ulster Unionist Party said the threats are the
result of last week's ruling that the IRA had not resumed its war
against British rule.
</P>
<P>
Ulster Unionist security spokesman Ken Maginnis called on
Monday for Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam to resign.
</P>
<P>
The unionists are pressing for an early meeting with British
Prime Minister Tony Blair to discuss the crisis in the peace
process as more young people are ordered to leave Northern Ireland
by paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionists are expected to hold a key meeting on
Tuesday to decide whether to take part in a review of the troubled
Good Friday pact, due to start next Monday, and whether to mount a
court challenge to Mowlam's ruling on the IRA ceasefire.

BELGRADE, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The major task of the Yugoslav
Serb Republic is to maintain social and economic stability,
Foreign Minister Mirko Marjanovich said on Tuesday when he visited
Zrenjanin city in Vojvodina Autonomous Province.
</P>
<P>
Despite the impact of NATO's airstrikes against Yugoslavia and
international sanctions during the past eight months, the Serb
Republic government has maintained market stability by allowing
prices to fluctuate within a 2 percent margin, and insuring the
living standard of civilians, Marjanovich said when he met with
local officials.
</P>
<P>
The government will continue to pursue the stability policy. It
will also try its best to ensure gasoline supplies, children's
welfare and salary payments.
</P>
<P>
Marjanovich stressed that problem of housing those who lost
their residences must be settled before November.
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation is going well in many regions as bridges,
roads, railways and other basic facilities destroyed by NATO's
bombs have been rebuilt, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government will put 800 million dinars (about 70 million U.
S. dollars) into the restoration of the power system -- which
suffered heavy damages during the airstrikes -- to ensure heating
service in the winter, he added.

<HEADLINE> Asian Parliamentarians to Meet in Dhaka Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Lawmakers from 36 Asian countries
will meet here Wednesday for a four-day conference in the
Bangladeshi capital Dhaka to explore avenues for mutual
cooperation to establish peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the conference, "Asian Parliamentarians'
Conference for Peace and Cooperation," is peace, which "is not
merely absence of war, conflict or violence. It is a state in
which each nation can flourish according to its own wish and
includes overall social and economic growth, removal of injustice,
respect for human rights and humanitarian laws, among other
factors."
</P>
<P>
Four papers on different subjects relating to peace will be
presented at the conference. The topics have been chosen in the
light of the Hague Agenda for Peace and Justice in the 21st
century which was adopted at an international conference held in
May this year.
</P>
<P>
The topics include: root causes of war and culture of peace,
international humanitarian and human rights law and institutions,
prevention, resolution and transformation of violent conflicts,
and disarmament and human security.
</P>
<P>
The conference is scheduled to be inaugurated by Bangladeshi
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The opposition parties, however,
have decided to boycott the meeting, which is expected to
culminate in forming an association of legislative bodies of Asian
Countries.
</P>
<P>
"We have already proposed formation of an Association of Asian
Parliaments for Peace for effective coordination among the
legislative bodies of the region," Bangladeshi Speaker Humayun
Rashid Chowdhury told reporters last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said the idea of holding such a conference came at the third
parliamentarians conference of SAARC (South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation) held in Dhaka in March this year. "Later we
decided to host the conference," he said.
</P>
<P>
A report in the Daily Star said the conference, on its
concluding day, is likely to come out with a declaration to be
named Dhaka Declaration, highlighting some specific objectives to
be realized through united efforts of parliaments of the region.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-three countries have been invited, and 35 countries have
committed to attending the conference, funded by the Bangladeshi
government and the United Nations Development Program.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Some 46 founding members of the
rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) signed a cease-fire
agreement in Lusaka Tuesday afternoon, raising hope that the
year-long civil war in Democratic Congo can be ended at long last.
</P>
<P>
Zambian President Federick Chiluba sponsored the signing
ceremony at the Inter-continental hotel here with ministers from
the 14-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC), as
well as Rwanda and Uganda who had supported the rebels, attending
the function.
</P>
<P>
Six countries involving in the Congolese conflict signed the
accord in Lusaka on July 10, but the RCD did not seal the pact
over disagreement which faction should sign on its behalf.
</P>
<P>
It was decided that the founding members of the split RCD would
come to Zambia to sign the accord in late August, which would pave
the way for the deployment of international peace-keepers and
direct talks between the Kinshasa government and political and
military groups opposing its rule.
</P>
<P>
The civil war in former Zaire broke out on August 2 last year,
and the RCD rebels have been backed by Uganda and Rwanda while
Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola sent troops to fight on the side of
Congolese President Laurent Kabila.

<HEADLINE> Vehicle Jacking Kills 15 in Somali Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 31 (Xinhua) -- At least 15 people were killed
and more than 19 others wounded when unidentified gunmen attacked
a public transport bus and a lorry in Mogadishu Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, more than 10 well-armed men riding a
Toyota pickup attacked the two vehicles in the jacking operation.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen attacked the bus which was transporting more than 60
people to villages north of Jowahar, a town some 90 kilometers
north of the capital Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of fire between the two sides had forced the
security guards of the vehicles to run for their lives, leaving
the bus in the hands of the attackers.
</P>
<P>
An eyewitness said that the gunmen threw the passengers one by
one out of the bus no matter what their status were. Some of the
passengers were dead while others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the attack is not known. However, sources close
to the militiamen said that the gunmen in north Mogadishu had
earlier forcefully stolen a vehicle belonging to the clansmen of
the gunmen who launched the Tuesday operation.
</P>
<P>
Faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid controls the area where
the incident took place Tuesday, while those who looted the cars
belong to the faction of Ali Mahdi Mohamed. It doesn't seem that
neither of the two faction leaders fully controls the militiamen
in the areas they claim responsibility.
</P>
<P>
The jacking and clashes have worsened the security situation in
the capital of Somalia where there has been for long no central
administration since 1991.

<P>
KAMPALA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Seventeen people have been
confirmed dead in a big landslide in Uganda's eastern district of
Mbale Monday.
</P>
<P>
The landslide, which occurred in the morning, was triggered by
a heavy downpour in the area, local media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the heavy rain washed away makeshift bridges
linking two sub-counties to the main road.
</P>
<P>
The bridges were constructed to assist and transport essential
household commodities after last year's landslide which killed 35
people and left over 2,000 others homeless.
</P>
<P>
Seven bodies have so far been recovered and six survivors have
been admitted to local hospitals, the report added.

Brussels, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat started his two-day visit to the Netherlands on Tuesday by
receiving a honorary award, a Dutch government official said.

his Gaza office, he called for a greater European role in the
peace process, and for Dutch aid in the building of a Palestinian
port in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators last week discussed opening
the first Palestinian seaport and for passageways for Palestinians
between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

<P>
Van Aartsen said the Dutch government was considering
cooperation with the Palestinian Authority on justice matters. It

construct a police academy.
</P>

Arafat is expected to meet other high-ranking Dutch officials
on Wednesday, including Prime Minister Wim Kok, Development
Cooperation Minister Eveline Herfkens and Agricultural Minister

HELSINKI, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Latvian President-Elect

join the European Union (EU) during the Finnish presidency.
</P>

possibility of applying for Russian assistance on solving domestic
problems, stressing that Latvia is an independent country pursuing
its own security plans.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, Palestinian Leaders Discuss Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
on Tuesday held talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on the
latest developments of the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Egypt's Mediterranean port city of
Alexandria, 220 kilometers northwest of Cairo, earlier in the day,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
His visit came amid reports that the Palestinians and Israelis
are close to an agreement on the implementation of the Wye peace
accord signed in October. Arafat left Alexandria after the talks.
</P>
<P>
It is possible that an agreement will be signed in Alexandria
on Thursday for the implementation of the Wye accord, Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters after the meeting
between Mubarak and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel "will intensify their negotiations
in the next few hours in an effort to reach a final formula for
the agreement," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Neither Arafat nor Mubarak spoke to reporters after their
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is reportedly hoping to host the signing ceremony of the
expected agreement on the implementation of the Wye accord during
the planned visit of Secretary of State of the United States
Madeleine Albright on Thursday within a regional tour.
</P>
<P>
Differences exist between the two sides over the timetable for
the Israeli troop pullback and the number of Palestinians to be
freed stipulated under the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians demand that Israel release 650 political
prisoners, those jailed for anti-Israel activities. But Israel
insists that it will release only 500 prosoners and will not free
those Palestinians involved in killings of Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has proposed to postpone the
last of the three-stage troop withdrawals stipulated in the Wye
accord until February next year, when the two sides are supposed
to have worked out a framework for the final-status talks, which
deal with thorny issues like Jerusalem and Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians want Israel to complete all the troop
withdrawals at an earlier date in line with the original timetable
of the Wye accord, which calls on Israel to hand over 13 percent
of the West Bank over a period of 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
Barak's hare-line predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu froze the Wye
accord late last December after carrying out the first stage of
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel in 1979, plays an active role to mediate the Arab-Israeli
peace talks, especially on the Palestinian track.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua)-- To guarantee the healthy

the country's marriage law was drafted in the early 1950s, soon
after the founding of New China.
</P>
<P>
He said that the pace of promulgating civil laws and
regulations has quickened since the country adopted the reform and
opening-up policy in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that to meet the needs of future economic
development, China will continue to strengthen civil laws.
</P>
<P>
He urged that a property rights law be drafted and the marriage
law revised. He also said specific clauses should be added against
violation of personal and property rights.

<HEADLINE> Unionists May Try to Delay N. Irish Peace Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's main unionist
party, the Ulster Unionist Party, may call for next week's review
of the province's faltering peace accord to be delayed, said
political sources on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The party's leader David Trimble was planning to urge British
Prime Minister Tony Blair to postpone the review of problems
facing the Good Friday accord, the Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
UUP sources said the possibility of calling for a delay of the
review, to be chaired by U.S. mediator George Mitchell, would be
explored at Tuesday's meeting attended by UUP politicians.
</P>
<P>
The UUP was also expected to decide whether to mount a legal
challenge to last Thursday's ruling by Northern Ireland Secretary
Mo Mowlam that the Irish Republican Army has maintained a truce in
its long war against British rule, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Blair signaled on Tuesday that recent IRA death threats
against several teenagers in Northern Ireland would not change his
government's conviction that the guerrilla group's ceasefire was
holding.

ISLAMABAD, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz

"Now, it's the turn of Kashmir where plebiscite is to be held,"

<HEADLINE> DPRK Criticizes Japan For Exaggerating DPRK Missile Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The official media of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Tuesday criticized
Japan for claiming the DPRK represented a missile threat to its
country.
</P>
<P>
Japan's claim that the DPRK was a threat to the region is "
sheer fiction" which is aimed at painting the country as a nuclear
threat and to justify its hostile policy, said the Korean Central
News Agency (KCNA) in a commentary.
</P>
<P>
The commentary was issued to mark the first anniversary of a
satellite launch on August 31 last year.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said, Japan "made a far-fetched assertion" that
"neither missile launch nor satellite launch in the DPRK can be
allowed."
</P>
<P>
"Their final aim is to realize their ambition to become a
military and nuclear power at an early date and strengthen '
cooperation' with the United States and the Republic of Korea in a
bid to thoroughly isolate and stifle the DPRK," it said.
</P>
<P>
The KCNA commentary said history had shown Japan to be the
aggressor, recalling the brutal 1910-45 colonial rule of the
Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"If they dare provoke a war, we will not miss the opportunity
to seek revenge upon the enemy," it said.

<HEADLINE> EU Trade Growth is Weak in First Five Months of 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's (EU)
trade growth with most of its partners was weak or declining in
the first five months of this year, EU statistics office, Eurostat,
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 15-country bloc's trade with the outside world was 2.6
billion euros (2.73 billion U.S. dollars) in May this year, down
from 5.9 billion euros (6.2 billion U.S. dollars) in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
There was a deficit of 11.5 billion euros (12 billion U.S.
dollars) in the first five months compared to a surplus of 3.2
billion euros (3.36 billion U.S. dollars) in the same period of
1998, the Eurostat said in a report.
</P>
<P>
There were signs of renewed growth in imports in May, mainly in
the "machinery and vehicles" sector, while exports continued to
fall, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
During the five-month period, exceptions were exports to China,
with an increase of 16 percent, and imports from Hungary with a 19
percent increase, the report shows.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, trade with Russia and Norway were weak, the
Eurostat indicated. From January to May, the EU's export with
Russia registered a decrease of 55 percent and a fall of 10
percent for imports. While trade with Norway recorded an 11
percent decrease for exports and 23 percent cut in imports.
</P>
<P>
Between January and May, Germany still enjoyed the largest
surplus of 25.3 billion euros (26.6 billion U.S. dollars), while
Britain's deficit rose to 20.3 billion euros (21.3 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Eurostat also estimated that the euro zone would have a
trade surplus of 8.7 billion euros (9.1 billion U.S. dollars) with
other parts of the world in June 1999, up 0.4 billion euros (0.42
billion U.S.dollars) from June last year. The euro zone is
composed of all EU countries but Britain, Denmark, Greece and
Sweden.

<HEADLINE> World Tallest Building Opens in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The world's tallest
building -- Malaysia's Petronas Twin Towers was officially opened
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Opening the building on the occasion of Malaysia's 42nd
National Day, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said the Petronas
Twin Towers is a symbol of the country's towering ambition to
become a developed country.
</P>
<P>
The 1.8 billion ringgit (473.684 million U.S. dollars) 88-story
building, located at the Kuala Lumpur City Center (KLCC), is a
steel and glass architectural marvel that gained international
fame through a recent Hollywood movie "Entrapment" and is also a
symbol of the country's progress, Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
"We are not a big country nor a very rich one. But we build
what we can afford. And we can afford the Twin Towers," he said at
a ceremony held amid a dazzling light-and-sound show that lit up
the sky.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that the Twin Towers, owned by the national oil
corporation -- Petronas, was built because " a country needs
something to look up to".
</P>
<P>
Had Malaysia been in economic turmoil when the decision to
build the project was made several years ago, "we would not have
decided to build the Twin Towers," he said, adding this was
because the project was not as high in terms of priority as truly
infrastructure projects such as the now-postponed hydroelectric
Bakun dam or the new international airport.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir was confident that over time, the controversy and
snide remarks surrounding the Petronas Twin Towers would cease and
the people would think of the project as the symbol of Malaysia's
progress.
</P>
<P>
The Petronas Twin Towers was a very sophisticated building
whose construction required the latest know-how, he said, adding
the locals had gained a lot of experience from managing the
construction of the tower and the complex and this experience
would definitely enhance the knowledge and expertise of
Malaysians.

<HEADLINE> Canada is Shocked at Cyber Hacker Breach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Canada is shocked at a report
that Microsoft Corp. Monday admitted that cyber hackers had
overcome the security of a free e-mail service used by more than
40 million people worldwide.
</P>
<P>
There are 2.5 million Hotmail users in Canada, who have urged
for measures to prevent the biggest ever breach of consumer
privacy from happening again.
</P>
<P>
The National Post newspaper Tuesday quoted Canadian computer
science experts as saying: "There's no excuse for not having the
system secure."
</P>
<P>
According to the National Post, a copy of the so call "exploit"
was made available Monday to the newspaper, but Microsoft has
sealed the breach by that time and the exploit was ineffective.
</P>
<P>
The exploit, as termed by hackers, is referred to loopholes
which could be used by an unauthorized person to read, delete and
forward a Hotmail user's E-Mail.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft said Monday it had sealed up the hole in its Hotmail
service by 1:30 EDT, and no instances were reported of consumers
losing sensitive information.

<HEADLINE> UK's Blair Considers IRA Cease-fire Holding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
on Tuesday indicated that recent death threats from the IRA (Irish
Republican Army) would not change his government's conviction that
the guerrilla group's cease-fire in Northern Ireland was holding.
</P>
<P>
In the last three days, the IRA has ordered six Catholic
teenagers to leave Northern Ireland under threat of death.
</P>
<P>
While describing the death threats as "totally indefensible," a
spokesman for Blair said on Tuesday that similar activities, like
punishment beatings, had continued all the way through the IRA's
last cease-fire, which broke down in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Blair's spokesman said former U.S. Senator George Mitchell was
ready to launch his review of the province's stalled peace process
on Monday but would first be seeking assurances from all parties
that they remained committed to it, according to a Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
Unionists reportedly will meet on Tuesday to decide whether to
take part in the review and whether to mount a court challenge to
Mowlam's ruling on the IRA cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Blair's office also signaled that he stood firmly behind Mowlam,
despite Unionist calls for her resignation, as the spokesman said:
"The Secretary of State has done one of the most difficult jobs in
government extremely well and continues to do so."
</P>
<P>
Blair, fresh back from holiday, will talk to his Northern
Ireland minister, Mo Mowlam, later in the day, Reuters said.
</P>
<P>
"He was fully consulted and fully supported the statement she
made last week," the spokesman was quoted saying. "He supports
that 100 percent."
</P>
<P>
Mowlam angered pro-British Ulster Unionists by ruling the Irish
Republican Army had not broken a two-year-old cease-fire despite
alleged links to the murder of a Belfast man and a plot to smuggle
guns from the United States, according to earlier reports.

<HEADLINE> Jiang's Visit to Bring Sino-Thai Relations Into New Era (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 31 (Xinhua) - The friendly relations between
China and Thailand are expected to enter a new era as Chinese
President Jiang Zemin makes a state visit to Thailand this week.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin, who will visit Thailand from September 2-
6, will be the only foreign dignitary who has been invited by Thai
King Bhumibol Adulyadej to visit Thailand this year before the
king's 72nd, or sixth cycle, birthday on December 5.
</P>
<P>
China and Thailand have enjoyed long-standing friendship since
ancient times. After the establishment of diplomatic relations in
1975, the two countries quickened the pace of developing friendly
relations in all areas.
</P>
<P>
Sharing similar or identical views on key international issues,
China and Thailand maintain good cooperation in dealing with
regional and international affairs.
</P>
<P>
It is widely known that Sino-Thai relations have become a model
for countries with different social systems to develop mutually
beneficial, cooperative, friendly and good neighborly relations.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed a joint statement on the Plan of
Action for the 21st century early this year when Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan visited Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The plan sets the direction for political, economic and social
cooperation between the two countries for the next 100 years. It
will also serve as a blueprint to be followed by government
agencies in both countries in order to maximize cooperation during
the next century.
</P>
<P>
Politically, the two countries have been strengthening ties
through a frequent exchange of high level visits this year.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, Chairman of China's National People's Congress visited
Thailand in April, and Thai Princess Sirindhorn paid her ninth
visit to China in the same month with Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai following in step.
</P>
<P>
And now, the highest level visit by President Jiang will
further promote the development of bilateral relations, according
to the Thai prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Beyond politics, China and Thailand have also developed strong
economic and trade relations. Bilateral trade increased to 3.56
billion U.S. dollars from 24.6 million dollars when diplomatic
relations were first established.
</P>
<P>
Both countries have managed to keep a balance in bilateral
trade.
</P>
<P>
China's exports to Thailand have expanded from traditional
Chinese medicine, light industrial products and crude oil to
mechanical equipment, engines, electricity generators, machine
tools and steel products.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thailand's exports to China go beyond traditional
products.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation between the two countries is no longer
limited to trade. Thailand is an important investor in China with
more than 2,000 investment projects worth more than one billion
dollars, while Chinese companies are active in bidding on projects
in Thailand. More

<P>
The two countries have also beefed up their cooperation in
scientific research. A joint committee, set up in 1978, meets
annually to encourage scientists from both countries to launch
joint research projects in the fields of agriculture, medicine,
food, mining, transportation biology and information technology.
</P>
<P>
Cultural exchanges are developing smoothly thanks to a
memorandum of understanding on cultural exchange and cooperation
signed by the two countries in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, as the Chinese people celebrate the 50th anniversary
of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the Thai
people preparing for their king's sixth cycle birthday, several
cultural groups from both countries have visited each other to
commemorate the great events.
</P>
<P>
As China's economy keeps growing, more and more Chinese people
visit Thailand. The kingdom has become the top destination when
Chinese want to go abroad for a holiday.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, more than 600,000 Chinese visited Thailand. China is
expected to become the largest overseas tourism market for
Thailand within the next three years, a Thai tourism official
predicted.
</P>
<P>
It is shared by both Thai and Chinese sides that the
development of an "all-weather, all-dimension" relationship is in
the interests of the two peoples and also conducive to the peace,
stability and development of the region.
</P>
<P>
As the world is about to enter a new millennium, the visit paid
by China's highest official to Thailand will be, as Thai Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai said, "a historical landmark" in bilateral
relations that will initiate a new era of comprehensive
cooperation and common development.

<HEADLINE> Banks in Shanghai Expanding Cooperation with Overseas Counterparts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Pudong Development
Bank (SPDB) signed contracts with three foreign banks today to
bolster their efforts to expand Renminbi yuan-based businesses.
</P>
<P>
The three foreign banks, the French Credit Lyonnais SA, the U.S.
-based Bank of America, and the Japanese Daiichi Kangyo Bank, will
receive a total of 160 million yuan (19 million US dollars) in
interbank loans from SPDB.
</P>
<P>
All four of the banks also planned to increase their
cooperation in interbank loans and project financing, and will
soon grant 400 million yuan in syndicated loans to several local
firms.
</P>
<P>
Financial experts said that China has granted licenses to 19
overseas banks to start yuan-based business since March 1997,
however, these foreign banks lack sufficient operating funds for
such business.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese commercial banks in Shanghai, China's largest
trade and financial center, have taken steps to increase
cooperation with foreign counterparts soon after the central bank
announced it would expand foreign banks' scope of Renminbi
business.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Communications, the Industrial and Commercial Bank
of China, the Agricultural Bank of China and CITIC Bank of China
have all started interbank loaning with foreign banks in Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Host Inaugural Meeting to Launch East Asia-Latin America Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman from Singapore's
Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced here Tuesday that the
inaugural meeting of officials to launch the East Asia-Latin
America Forum (EALAF) mooted by Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong will take place here from September 1 to 3, and 27 East Asian
and Latin American countries will be represented at the event.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman quoted the prime minister as saying Tuesday that
he is encouraged with the level of support for the forum and
pleased to see the initiative get off ground quickly.
</P>
<P>
"This shows that all participating countries welcome the need
for formal dialogue and cooperation between our regions. I hope,
over time, regular contacts will connect our regions which have
been separated by history and geography," the prime minister was
quoted.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the meeting will launch a process of
multi-dimensional dialogue and cooperation between East Asia and
Latin America and the three objectives of the meeting are to
discuss the strategic rationale for the forum to link East Asia
and Latin America and its multi-dimensional structure, to start
the preparatory process for the second meeting of the Forum at the
foreign minister's level that will take place in about one year
and to discuss concrete projects of cooperation among the forum's
participating countries.
</P>
<P>
The project of the forum was first put forth by Prime Minister
Goh Chok Tong during his visit to Chile in October 1998 and the
idea met with active response from relative countries, the
spokesman said, adding that countries attending the inaugural
meeting are Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador,
Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela, Singapore,
Brunei, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia,
Laos, Indonesia, Myanmar, Japan, China, South Korea, Australia and
New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Goh conceived the forum as a
multi-dimensional dialogue to help break down barriers and
encourage the evolution of more concrete links between East Asia
and Latin America and he believes the forum will contribute to a
stable international order by interconnecting two important growth
areas of the world.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister had said the potential of linking
the two regions is likely to take 10 years or more due to the lack
of historic contact, awareness and understanding between both
regions and the launch of the forum will thus be the start of a
long-term process to bring that synergy to fruition, the spokesman
added.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Ruling Party Leader Relieved of Party Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Akhtaruzzaman Chowdhury Babu,
commerce and industries secretary of the ruling Bangladesh Awami
League, who allegedly forced the chairman and other directors of a
bank to resign and declared himself as the new chairman of the
bank, has been relieved of his responsibility, a party press
release said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Babu, a former member of parliament, has been stripped of the
party responsibility for his activities against the ideals,
programs, constitution, rules and regulations and the interest of
the Awami League, said a press release signed by Abdul Mannan
Khan, office secretary of the party.
</P>
<P>
Eight directors of the United Commercial Bank Limited (UCBL)
were discussing matters of the bank at a meeting last Thursday
when Babu and some armed supporters reportedly broke into the
board room and forced the directors to resign.
</P>
<P>
The head office of the UCBL in the city's Motijheel commercial
area was sealed by police and put under police custody the next
day, and an administrator from the central Bangladesh Bank was
appointed.
</P>
<P>
The High Court, acting upon a writ petition filed by UCBL
Chairman Zafar Ahmed Chowdhury, later stayed the order of the
Bangladesh Bank, allowed Ahmed Chowdhury and the directors to
carry out their functions and asked the central bank to present an
inquiry report of the bank incident.
</P>
<P>
The UCBL, a private bank, has 79 branches throughout the
country with a deposit of 11 billion taka (220 million U.S.
dollars) and employing more than 2,500 people, according to Zafar
Ahmed Chowdhury.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev will fly to Tashkent Wednesday to discuss with leaders of
Uzbekistan ways to help Kyrgyzstan fight Islamic militants that
roam Kyrgyzstan and the Central Asian region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Bishkek has officially requested Russian military assistance
to eliminate a large formation of militants entrenched in
southwest Kyrgyzstan, the Interfax news agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said the Russian Defense Ministry was closely
studying the possibility of giving military assistance to
Kyrgyzstan to stamp out the extremists.
</P>
<P>
He said the question of assigning military hardware and
ammunition to Kyrgyz armed forces was considered.
</P>
<P>
"There is no talk yet of sending Russian ground forces to the
area of hostilities," Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
Interfax, quoting Russian military experts, said several
hundred militants are entrenched in southwest Kyrgyzstan and are
holding a number of hostages, including the commander of the
Kyrgyz Interior Troops and four Japanese geologists.

<HEADLINE> Technological Innovation Top Agenda of China's Scientific Development Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of China's science and
technology programs are speeding up the drafting of their five-
year development plan in the next century, putting technological
innovation at the top of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Science and Technology Zhu Lilan said that the 10th
five-year scientific development program (2001-2005) will center
on expanding the contribution of science development to economic
growth, increasing the share of added-value of high-tech ventures
among all industrial enterprises, and increasing export volumes
from high-tech ventures.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said this last week in Beijing during discussions with some
of the country's legislators who were participating in a national
conference on technological innovation.
</P>
<P>
Zhu told members of the Education, Science, Culture and Health
Committee under the National People's Congress (NPC), the country'
s top legislature, that there are several major areas of focus for
the 10th five-year development program: pushing ahead the
agricultural scientific revolutionary process; raising the
technological level of the industrial ventures in a bid to boost
the growth of high-tech ventures; encouraging sustainable
development; upgrading traditional industries, developing
technologies for the service sector, environmental protection and
comprehensive utilization of resources; and promoting development
of technology for use in both military and civilian fields.
</P>
<P>
China plans to turn nearly all research and development
institutes into technology-based ventures by the end of the year
2000 in order to get most scientists and technicians directly
involved in technological developments and their industrial use.
</P>
<P>
Later this year, the ministry will host a national conference
on the work to spread scientific knowledge while wiping out
superstitious thinking among the public, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Echoing the minister's call for support, Peng Peiyun, vice-
chairwoman of the NPC Standing Committee, said that the NPC is
considering drafting a law on promoting hi-tech industrial zones
in China, as well as other laws concerning scientific and
technological development.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Ecuadorian President (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji said here
today during a meeting with visiting Ecuadorian President Jamil
Mahuad that China is ready to develop friendly relations of
cooperation with all Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
All countries and regions across the world are developing by
their own momentum, he said, adding that Latin America is a
continent full of hope.
</P>
<P>
Although it is faced with difficulties in its economic growth,
it embraces a bright future, Zhu explained.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier called Mahuad's visit to China a "major
event" in China-Ecuador relations, saying it will help increase
mutual understanding and friendship and put bilateral relations on
a vigorous growth track.
</P>
<P>
The Ecuadorian president noted that his visit came at a time
close to the 50th birth anniversary of the People's Republic of
China and the 20th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic
relations between China and Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
He described the visit as "very successful" and having pushed
forward cooperation in various areas between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
While Zhu said that multi-polarization is an irreversible trend
of the world and the world cannot fall under the influence of one
or two countries, Mahuad stressed that it is "not a good thing"
that the world affairs fall under the monopoly of any single
nation.
</P>
<P>
Mahuad said the world should be a multi-polarized one.

"Latin American countries, if united for a common development,
can play a greater role in world affairs," Mahuad said.
</P>
<P>
Mahuad added that Ecuador supports China in its efforts to play
a more important role in the world and is fully in favor of China'
s accession to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Rongji noted that China-Ecuador friendly relations have
been growing steadily since the two forged diplomatic relations in
1980.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation on a mutual beneficial basis has been strengthened.
The two sides have wide common ground, and therefore can
understand each other and conduct close cooperation on many
international issues, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
China will, together with the Ecuadorian side, make concerted
efforts to bring a long-term, stable and comprehensively developed
China-Ecuador friendly relations into the 21st century, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Mahuad held talks Monday
afternoon and agreed to further expand bilateral trade and
economic cooperation and their overall friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, Chairman of the Standing Committee of China's National
People's Congress, met with Mahuad earlier this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Mahuad arrived here Sunday for a week-long state visit to China.

<HEADLINE> China to Play Greater Role in World Philately, FIP President (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- China can be the backbone of the
world's philatelic sector in the 21st century, according to the
president of the Federation of International Philately (FIP).
</P>
<P>
Knud Mohr made the comments in a winding up address at the
China 1999 World Philatelic Exhibition, which ended yesterday in
Beijing, and also praised the Chinese organising committee of the
event for its efforts in making the exhibition a huge success.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the worldwide experts and exhibition visitors were
pleasantly surprised at the smooth organization," said Mohr in an
exclusive interview with Xinhua. "China has most definitely
demonstrated it has the ability to host such important world
events."
</P>
<P>
"Staging the FIP's flagship event in China was a historic
milestone in the philatelic world," added Mohr.
</P>
<P>
The aims of the FIP, which was founded on June 18, 1926, are to
popularize philately throughout the world and arouse people's
interest in stamp collecting, the 62-year-old Danish philatelist
explained.
</P>
<P>
"And despite only being formed 17 years ago the All China
Philatelic Federation (ACPF) is already recognised as a model in
the philatelic circle," he said.
</P>
<P>
"All those involved with this young organization should be
praised for their excellent work during the 10-day event," Mr Mohr
went on.
</P>
<P>
The exhibits were world class and included the original artist'
s designs of the famous British Penny Black, the world's first
stamp, as well as other unique stamps and envelopes owned by
famous philatelists.
</P>
<P>
"From the 1996 Asia Philatelic Exhibition, which was also held
in China, to the FIP exhibition, the focus of world philately has
been shifted to Asian countries, especially China, which boasts 20
million stamp collectors," Mohr said.

<HEADLINE> China's First Palm Held Aircraft Developed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A miniature multi-purpose
aircraft that can land and take off from the palm of a hand has
been developed in China.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the new product, the first of its kind in
China, can be used for both military and civilian purposes, such
as making a reconnaissance of enemy positions, locating victims of
disasters, patrolling pastures and monitoring traffic and
environmental conditions.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft, developed by the Nanjing University of
Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA) in east China's Jiangsu
Province, weighs only 350 grams and has a width of 45 centimeters
when both wings are fully outstretched.
</P>
<P>
The radio-controlled aircraft, equipped with a gas engine, has
a top speed of 80 km per hour and can fly nonstop for 20 minutes
within a radius of 1,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
A video camera and transmitter attached to its underbelly
enable simultaneously taking and sending pictures of objects on
the ground to a receiver when it is in flight.
</P>
<P>
During a demonstration flight here today, the tiny aircraft
took off smoothly and looped and circled in the air. A ground
monitor showed pictures of buildings, streets, fields and even
moving vehicles that the aircraft was photographing.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Guoming, who is in charge of the development of the project,
said that the miniature aircraft differs from a model plane mainly
because it has an automatic stabilizing system and is controlled
by means of a camera installed on the plane instead of the human
eye. It will be further improved to gain more functions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Great attention has been paid to the development of miniature
aircraft worldwide in recent years. The smallest aircraft in the
world is only 15 centimeters in width.

<TEXT>
<P>
As modern postal services originated in European countries,
philately developed early there and collectors were able to obtain
many rare stamps and others items at fairly low prices.
</P>
<P>
"Asian people expect to pay much more for their collections,"
Mohr said.
</P>
<P>
However, the booming stamp trade could help philatelists all
over the world, including those in China, buy foreign and even
rare stamps.
</P>
<P>
"Most European and American youngsters are currently pre-
occupied with ultra-modern activities such as surfing the web and
computer games," Mohr said. "They simply do not have the patience
to sit silently and just enjoy the many varied and colorful stamps.
</P>
<P>
"However, the Chinese young people still find enjoyment in
collecting stamps. Indeed, many of them develop their personality
and creativity through philately."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the fact that some people regard stamp collecting
as an investment, Mohr said, "It's true that collecting can be an
investment, but first and foremost it is a personal hobby."
</P>
<P>
"If a collector is always assessing the profits made from
trading or worries about the devaluation of stamps, he loses the
joy of the hobby," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mohr also said he is not surprised at the success of Chinese
philatelists in the FIP championships during the exhibition. "They
demonstrated high standards of stamp albums to international
jurors and visitors," he said.

FUKUOKA, Japan, August 31 (Xinhua) -- He had the game, as we

</P>
<P>
The NBA prospect Yao Ming scored 20 points in 20 minutes to

different lines-up in each half to beat up Kuwait for its third
consecutive victories.
</P>
<P>
"Every one had the equal opportunity on the court," said China'
s head coach Jiang Xingquan. "We played an excellent inside game
against the smaller Kuwait's team."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's top-scorer Mubarak Osamah chipped in 16 points and was
outrebounded 23-45.
</P>
<P>
A brawl in a game between Lebanon and Saudi Arabia scared the
so far mild-tempered competition with Lebanon having its semi-
final dream severely damped after a 92-69 defeat.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's Khatib Fadi slapped flagrantly into Fallath Mokhtar's
face when Mokhtar was dribbling towards the basket with 34 seconds
left in the game. There were some shoves and pushes before the
two were broke away by teammates.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, who surprised reigning champions South Korea 75-65 on
Sunday, virtually gave up the match after the brawl.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Taipei had its unbeatable run snapped when its was
edged off by South Korea, 61-54, in a hard-fought match, while
Japan downed Syria 78-58 in another quarter-final match.
</P>
<P>
In the classification playoffs, the United Arab Emirates
squeezed through by a 79-72 win over Bahrain, Hong Kong of China
won its first game in the competition, a 89-59 triumph over
Malaysia, and Uzbekistan overcame Philippines 94-64.

<HEADLINE> Negotiations to Sell South Korean Bank Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government failed
to sell the Seoulbank to HSBC as negotiations collapsed Tuesday on
huge differences over terms of the deal, said a statement from the
Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC).
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum signed February 22 with HSBC, the South Korean
government showed its intent to sell the Seoulbank to the British
bank.
</P>
<P>
The FSC said in a statement that the talks had broken down on
huge differences over how to value the Seoulbank's assets and
future loan portfolio.
</P>
<P>
The FSC said the government would turn to renowned foreign
experts to have them manage Seoulbank and invest 4 to 5 trillion
won (3.33 to 4.17 billion U.S. dollars) to get it back on the
right track. State shares of the Seoulbank will be sold on
international financial markets.
</P>
<P>
After the financial crisis, the government decided to sell off
the Seoulbank and the Korea First Bank to foreign investors. So
far, a sale agreement in the amount of 600 million U.S. dollars
has been made between the Korea First Bank and a U.S. investment
consortium Newbridge Capital.

HONG KONG, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Statistics published Tuesday
by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority show that both total deposits
and total loans and advances increased during the month of July.
</P>

<P>
Total loans and advances saw a marginal rise of 0.1 percent in

On the other hand, domestic loans continued to decline in July
by 0.5 percent, but at a more moderate pace when compared with
previous months.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Opposed to Any Plan to Undermine Iraq's Sovereignty: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Tuesday expressed Pakistan's opposition to any plan to
undermine Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with visiting Speaker of the Iraqi National
Assembly Sa'doon Hammadi, Sharif said, "Pakistan would strongly
oppose any plan to undermine Iraq's sovereignty and territorial
integrity."
</P>
<P>
Sharif expressed the hope that the countries in the Gulf region
would evolve a regime towards confidence building to overcome the
legacy of the Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
He also said the Pakistani government and people were "deeply
distressed at the magnitude of human sufferings in Iraq caused by
eight-year-long U.N. sanctions."
</P>
<P>
These sufferings, Sharif said, should be alleviated "as early
as possible."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister reiterated Pakistan's position that problems
in the region should be solved peacefully through diplomatic
efforts and not through use of force.
</P>
<P>
He agreed with the need to reinvigorate cooperation between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Hammadi, who is visiting Pakistan at the head of a six-member
Iraqi parliamentary delegation, conveyed the desire of the Iraqi
government to re-energize bilateral relations with Pakistan,
consistent with the wishes of its people.
</P>
<P>
In this context, he referred to the goodwill which has all
along existed between the people of Iraq and Pakistan and the
potential for enhanced cooperation particularly in the economic
sphere.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi speaker also briefed Sharif on the situation faced by
Iraq as a consequence of U.N. economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq has already fulfilled all conditions set forth in
the U.N. Security Council resolutions particularly those relating
to the elimination of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"It was, therefore, obligatory that all sanctions imposed on
Iraq be lifted as provided in the U.N. resolutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hammadi recounted repeated attempts to prolong the sanctions
and to undermine Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also attended by Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- There were indications Monday that Israel would release at
least some prisoners of two Palestinian rejectionist groups as
part of the Wye negotiations, once it is convinced that the
prisoners and the groups they represent will cease the armed
struggle against Israel and join the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
The groups are the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine and the Popular Front of the Liberation of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will try to convince PNA
Chairman Yasser Arafat Tuesday to give his assent to an agreement
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Prime Minister Ehud Barak will sign the agreement in
Egypt Thursday at the presence of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright if the PNA chairman nods approval.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian position is that Israel's proposals on the
implementation of the Wye accord are reasonable and the
Palestinians should accept them and begin the implementation.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli police have launched a wide-ranging investigation
after two Israelis were found murdered near the West Bank Monday,
saying the possibility of a nationalist motive behind the killing
could not be ruled out. Barak expressed shock Monday night at the
murder of Yehezkel Shai, 26, and his girlfriend, Sharon Steinmetz,
21, and called on police to make every effort to catch the
perpetrators,
</P>
<P>
Yediot Ahronot:
</P>
<P>
-- The budget cut proposed by the Finance Ministry of Israel is
much harsher than previously published. At least 11 ministers have
been threatening to prevent the approval of the 2000 budget next
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Treasury officials are preparing "alternatives" to the proposed
cuts, including imposing tax on rent and cigarettes, if the budget
is not approved.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Threatens to Withdraw Process of KR Tribunal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. legal team
threatened Wednesday to cease its efforts to try former Khmer
Rouge leaders if the government of Cambodia can not meet the
conditions put forward by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Ralph Zacklin, assistant to the U.N. secretary general, told
reporters at a press conference here that "if the government is
not able to meet the conditions which the United Nations believes
are necessary for a tribunal that would be up to international
standard, the U.N. will simply cease to follow the process."
</P>
<P>
He added, "The government of Cambodia, of course, can proceed
on its own, to adopt the law, to set up a tribunal and even
receive assistance from outside, such as NGOs and individuals, but
not the assistance from the U.N."
</P>
<P>
No agreement was reached so far between the Cambodian and U.N.
legal groups on the establishment of a tribunal to try former
Khmer Rouge leaders. The two sides have held two rounds of talks
since the U.N. five-member legal team arrived in Phnom Penh on
August 25.
</P>
<P>
Zacklin said that "there is, at the present time, very wide
divergence in views as the nature of the tribunal we are talking
about." But he pointed out that both sides have the feeling that
it is important to continue the discussions in the efforts to find
some common grounds.
</P>
<P>
"The next step in this process", said Zacklin, "will be the
visit of Prime Minister Hun Sen to New York, and on that
occasion, we expect that the position of the Cambodian government
with regards to the U.N. proposal will be made clear."
</P>
<P>
The two sides differed mainly on the nature of the tribunal and
on who will have a majority of the judges. The Cambodian side
insisted on a municipal court with a majority of Cambodian judges
while the U.N. demanded forming an international-style ad hoc
tribunal in Cambodia with judges and prosecutors appointed by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Zacklin also said that the international assistance provided to
such a tribunal by judges, prosecutors and investigators and other
experts should not be seen as a violation of Cambodia's
sovereignty "but rather a contribution by the international
community to the Cambodian government and Cambodian people".
</P>
<P>
He referred to Prime Minister Hun Sen's warning early this
month that the U.N. should not violate Cambodia's sovereignty
which is also a member of the U.N., citing the U.N. wanted to
dominate the Cambodian court and procedure.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. legal team is to return New York Wednesday.

BEIRUT, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A member of the pro-Israeli
South Lebanon Army (SLA) was wounded Tuesday in south Lebanon
during Lebanese guerrillas' attacks, Lebanese security sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The militiaman was slightly hurt when his outpost at Arab
Salim village on the verge of the Israeli occupied border zone in
south Lebanon was hit by mortar rounds.
</P>
<P>
There has been no group claiming responsibility for the
attack, which has raised to 45 the number of SLA members wounded
in south Lebanon since the start of this year while another nine
members were killed.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been
spearheading a guerrillas' war to oust the Israeli occupation
troops and their allied SLA out of the country.

</P>
<P>
He Guangwei, director of China's National Tourism

China has already made tourism a new growth area for promoting
the development of the national economy, creating job
opportunities and eliminating poverty.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China's tourism sector reported a foreign exchange
income of 12.6 billion U.S. dollars from 63.49 million overseas
tourists. The number of domestic tourists reached 690 million in

<HEADLINE> Singapore Out to Address Long-term Manpower Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Tuesday launched the
Manpower 21, the overall integrated strategy of the country's
long-term development of work force, gearing up to address
challenges of the new millennium in manpower development with a
vision to turn the city state into a Talent Capital.
</P>
<P>
Manpower 21 is a blueprint covering the full manpower spectrum
and aimed at developing a globally competitive work force in
Singapore to power the country into a knowledge-based economy.
</P>
<P>
Six core strategies are listed in the plan to address various
aspects of the manpower value chain, including manpower planning,
lifelong learning, talent augmentation, manpower development,
workplace transformation and partnership in the face of rapid
advances in technology, and a constantly changing, highly
competitive external environment.
</P>
<P>
Under the Manpower 21, a ministerial-level national manpower
council will be created to set directions for manpower development
and oversee national manpower planning, manpower development and
talent attraction.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching ceremony, Singapore Deputy Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the Manpower 21 aims to transform
Singapore's work force to meet future manpower needs, enhance
competitiveness and minimize structural unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the centerpiece of the Manpower 21 is the idea of a
"school of lifelong learning" and this is a comprehensive
framework for in-employment education and training.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government will set up a dedicated manpower
development assistance scheme with initial funding of 200 million
Singapore dollars, expand the manpower development scheme and
continue to support the Skill Development Fund.
</P>
<P>
While stressing the urgency of manpower development, Lee said
although the economy is picking up again, companies are still
restructuring their operations and retrenching workers, especially
in the disk and PC industries.
</P>
<P>
He was believed to be referring to the recent retrenchment
exercises by some multinational companies in his country. In the
last few weeks alone in Singapore, Western Digital has announced
2,500 retrenchments, Seagate has been reported to be planning to
retrench 1,600 workers and Compaq decided to lay off 1,600

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
on Tuesday held talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on the
latest developments of the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Egypt's Mediterranean port city of Alexandria
earlier in the day, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
His visit came amid reports that the Palestinians and Israelis
are close to an agreement on the implementation of the Wye peace
accord signed in October.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, a frequent visitor to Egypt, turned to Mubarak, a
trusted adviser, for consultations on the peace negotiations with
Israel at this critical stage.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is reportedly in the hope of hosting the signing ceremony
of the expected agreement on the implementation of the Wye accord
during a visit to the region by Secretary of State of the United
States Madeleine Albright to start on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is scheduled to repeat his visit to Egypt on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the Wye accord, Israel should, among other things, pull
back troops from another 11 percent of the West Bank in the last
two of the three-phased withdrawals, and release hundreds of
Palestinian political prisoners held in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
Differences still exist between the two sides over the
timetable for the Israeli troop pullback and the number of
Palestinians to be freed.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Sri Lanka's Peace Process Unlikely to Make Headway in Run-up to National Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A new round of bipartisan talks
is due to take place Wednesday (September 1) between Sri Lanka's
ruling coalition and the main opposition party to work towards a
mutually acceptable peace proposal by the end of September under a
businessmen's initiative.
</P>
<P>
Then the influential business leader, Lalith Kottelawala, is
expected to meet the leader of separatist Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) with the bipartisan proposals in the first week
of October to broker peace for this war-ravaged island nation.
</P>
<P>
However, political analysts here said that in the run-up to the
national elections expected next year, political parties will be
reluctant to take a public stand on the emotional issue in fear it
could lose their votes, and the two leading Sinhalese parties are
mostly unlikely to agree with each other.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a 16-year-old civil war fought
between the Sinhalese majority controlled government and the LTTE
rebels who demand a separate Tamil homeland in the north and east
of the country.
</P>
<P>
More than 55,000 people have been killed in the conflict and
the fighting has eroded investor confidence and slowed economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga unveiled a power-sharing
political package four years ago to resolve the conflict through
non-violent means. The government had hoped to present the package
before parliament this month but last month's assassination of a
co-author of the draft had dealt a heavy blow to the entire
process.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Kumaratunga's People's Alliance (PA) government is
unable to push through any radical legislation because it lacks
the mandatory two-thirds majority in parliament and must have the
support of the main opposition United National Party (UNP) to
rewrite the constitution.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the UNP said they did not believe the
government's devolution plan could bring peace to the country as
Tamil rebels had rejected the plan.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar told the
Foreign Correspondents' Association recently that an end to the
bloodshed could only be achieved with the backing of the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
Kadirgamar, a member of the minority Tamil community who is
believed to top the LTTE hit list, said the actions of the LTTE
guerrillas in resorting to devastating attacks showed they were
unwilling to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
A.C. Hameed, leader of the UNP group to the bipartisan talks,
has said it is very unlikely that the businessmen's initiative
would result in any talks with the LTTE given the complexities of
the pre-election situation.
</P>
<P>
The businessmen's initiative, led by Sri Lankan tycoons Lalith
Kottelawala and Ken Balendra, is a bipartisan affair which depends
on the formation of a consensus between the PA and the UNP ahead
of any talks with the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
However, there are as many as seven major points of difference
between the PA and the UNP.
</P>
<P>
The two parties have divergent views on basics, like the
structure of the constitution, whether it should be unitary or
federal, whether devolution should go beyond the present structure
under the 13th Amendment, whether the north and the east should be
united to form one Tamil province or cut up into two or three
units.
</P>
<P>
Hameed felt that with such critical differences it is
impossible to come to an understanding by September 30, the
deadline agreed upon in the last bipartisan meeting called by the
businessmen's initiative.
</P>
<P>
Within the PA government itself, there is skepticism about the
September 30 deadline.
</P>
<P>
While Constitutional Affairs Minister G.L. Peiris, the leader
of the PA group to the talks, had committed himself to it, Foreign
Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar said that he did not believe in
deadlines. He told a news conference recently that a deadline was
only a statement of intention or a guideline.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kottelawala has insisted that he would not talk to
anybody in the LTTE except its supreme leader Velupillai
Prabhakaran. But it is well known that Prabhakaran does not
participate in talks for a long time.
</P>
<P>
The last time Prabhakaran talked to any leader was in 1987,
when he met then Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi in New Delhi,
but even that was only under duress. He did not participate even
in the Thimphu talks in the Bhutan capital held under India's
aegis when relations with India were relatively good.
</P>
<P>
On March 18, 1998 the Interpol sent out an international alert
for the arrest of Prabhakaran and four of his senior aides at Sri
Lanka's request.
</P>
<P>
Prabhakaran had exchanged letters with Sri Lankan presidents
Premadasa and Chandrika Kumaratunga, but did not meet them. He
would never expose himself for both security and political
reasons.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's peace prospects look dim as the peace process has
been at a deadlocked for the lack of bipartisan consensus between
the PA and the UNP and the LTTE's intransigence.
</P>
<P>
However, in an address to mark the PA fifth anniversary in
office on August 21, President Kumaratunga made it clear the
government was keen to end the war and implement the peace plan
next year. Kumaratunga urged the UNP, the LTTE and the leftist JVP
or People's Liberation Front to support her efforts.
</P>
<P>
Hameed is also hopeful that the businessmen's initiative would
not collapse as the search for peace was bound to go on.

<HEADLINE> Dozens of Forest Fires Reported in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- As many as 42 fires are consuming
forest resources in Canada's central province of Manitoba, where
more than 500 firefighters have been called in to tackle the
blazes.
</P>
<P>
According to the Manitoba Natural Resources Department, the
fires in the northern part of the province were still burning
Monday, with six major fires raging out of control.
</P>
<P>
There have been no casualties since the first fire was reported
last Friday, but the fires are threatening to consume "prime
forest-cutting areas," the department said.
</P>
<P>
The largest blaze has burnt nearly 60 square kilometers of the
forest northeast of Flin Flon, while another has destroyed 40
square kilometers northeast of Snow Lake.
</P>
<P>
The firefighters have used nine waterbombers, with the support
of 28 helicopters and 12 other aircraft in attempts to bring the
flames under control, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, seventeen fires were reported in Kenora, Dryden and
Red Lake in the western part of Ontario, but "nothing is
threatening communities," the local fire information sources said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
No reports have been released regarding the cause of the forest
fires.

<P>
In their first trip to China, many of the international
deputies to the UPC said that they were surprised by the level of
postal modernization in China.
</P>
<P>
Leavey said that since China will assume the chairmanship of
the Council of Administration of the Universal Postal Union (UPU)
over the next five years, its experience in modernizing its postal
service will be a good example for the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that China places importance on improving management
and talent in modernizing its postal services. It has introduced
international expertise to conduct a series of regulation reforms,
both in financial and employment terms, of the postal sector. He
noted that a great number of new staff that the post office has
employed in recent years are specialized in computer technology.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China Post has seen business volume grow by
over 120 fold and revenues grow by over 460 fold over the past
five decades. He said that many new services have emerged to
replace traditional ones. For example, the computerized network of
savings deposits at post offices has been extended to 527 cities
and counties around the country, while express mail services are
available in 1,983 cities and towns and have access to 26
countries and regions in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that China Post aims to apply advanced information
technology in the development of new postal products and services.
This year, the SPA will continue to concentrate investment on the
construction of a computer network of integrated services and
major postal hubs and the expansion of a postal financial services
network.

BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The modernization level of
Beijing's postal services is as high as in any developed countries
in the world, Thomas Leavey, secretary-general of the ongoing
Universal Postal Congress (UPC), has declared.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after visiting postal facilities in Beijing
recently.
</P>
<P>
He said that though postal infrastructure in some other areas
of China may not necessarily as good as in the big cities, such as
Beijing and Shanghai, China has made remarkable progress in the
modernization of its postal services.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a postal technology and equipment exhibition held
during the convocation of the UPC here opened the eyes of Chinese
and international postal representatives to the bright future of
postal modernization.
</P>
<P>
China displayed the world's first letter sorting and
classifying machine that can handle 32,000 letters per hour at the
exhibit, as well as a prize-winning multi-media postal voice
system.
</P>
<P>
The director of the State Postal Administration (SPA), Liu
Liqing, said that since a trend of merging information technology
with traditional postal services is on the rise in the postal
sector, China has been making efforts to combine the electronic
communication network closely with its postal goods delivery
network.
</P>
<P>
China is constructing a nationwide network of integrated postal
services supported by computers. It is designed to improve the
quality and efficiency of service and to open up new services such
as call centers and E-commerce.
</P>
<P>
To be completed in 2000, the computerized postal network will
change the face of postal services in the country. By then, people
will be able to obtain almost all postal services on-line,
including locating a single article of mail as it is being
delivered, shopping on the Internet and having the goods delivered
promptly by the post office.

<HEADLINE> Manila Vows to Keep Lower Deficit Till 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
vowed to keep a lower public sector deficit until next year, a
senior financial official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said in a press briefing
that the government move shows that it does not want to sacrifice
the nation's economic growth it has attained under the new
administration.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the country has only 2.2 percent deficit of GNP
while other Asian countries now experience between 3.5 to 5
percent deficit in their GNP, Philippine News Agency (PNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the International Monetary fund (IMF) has given the
country a two-year leeway to tackle the said deficit and keep the
economic fundamentals intact, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, it will be incumbent on the part of the government to
make the necessary adjustments in its economic targets for the
years 2000 and 2001 should there be changes in the economic path
the country is treading.
</P>
<P>
But one sure thing is that the IMF will still allow the country
to overshoot its 68-billion-peso (1.7-billion-U.S. dollar) target
deficit because of the leeway given by the IMF, he said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the IMF has allowed other countries to have ample
leeway which is much bigger than that of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
He said that even if there is visible proof of lesser revenue
collection, the government will still pursue its pump-priming
efforts in order to keep the programs of the new administration in
place.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the country's economic problems are basically
different from those of the other countries in the region," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
Vis-a-vis the GNP, the Philippines' public sector deficit is
still moderate compared with the neighboring economies which were
battered by the recent onslaught of the crisis, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Of all 13,000 mobile phone
subscribers in Ethiopia, 6,000 have cancelled their subscriptions,
Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation (ETC) disclosed on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The cancellations were due to high tariff and the high down
payments of the cellphone service, an official of the state-owned
corporation said.
</P>
<P>
With a capacity to serve 50,000 subscribers, the ETC is now
offering service to only 7,000 users mainly due to the high tariff
rate of about nine U.S. cents per minute.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of potential subscribers could not keep up the
payment, said an official of the corporation.
</P>
<P>
The corporation said it had undertaken a study on possibilities
of tariff reduction to increase the number of clients.
</P>
<P>
Abebe Gashaw, senior official of the Ethiopian
Telecommunication Corporation, said there may be tariff reduction
following approval of the study by the board.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Blames Donors for Africa's Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Tuesday blamed
donor countries for Africa's economic morass, saying that the
constant changing of goalposts by donors has made it difficult for
Africa to repay its debts.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper Tuesday quoted president Daniel arap
Moi as saying that the use of corruption as an excuse for
suspending funds was unfair, for no country in the world can say
it has got rid of this old vice.
</P>
<P>
Moi said the adage "he who plays the piper calls the tune"
mirrors exactly the relationship between developed and developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
He questioned the sincerity of donor agencies when addressing a
high- level seminar on Africa's external debt, which was attended
by financial ministers and governors of central banks from 17
African countries.
</P>
<P>
"How can African countries be expected to be up-to-date with
foreign debt repayments when illegal arms brought in from
developed countries continue to create instability thereby
hampering economic development?" he said.
</P>
<P>
Africa currently faces an external debt of more than 285
billion U.S. dollars, representing over 200 percent of its own
exports, according to World Bank statistics.

MACAO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Macao's unemployment rate from May
to July this year rose to 6.4 percent, statistics released Tuesday
by the Macao Census and Statistics Department show.
</P>
<P>
The figure was 0.1 percentage point higher than that during the
April-June period of this year and an increase of 1.7 percentage
points over the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Macao has been suffering from economic difficulties over the
past years and many people expect that Macao's forthcoming return
to the motherland will bring about brighter prospects.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions and other social bodies have urged the government
to create more jobs and cut the number of laborers coming from
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a government labor department issued a
circular requiring that employers who want to hire new workers get
registered at the department and give local people preferential
choices. However, the circular is not compulsory.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the new graduates who joined in the work force this

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Embark on Moral Rebirth Crusade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is to launch a national
moral and ethical rebirth program on September 9, in a bid to
promote positive attitudinal change among Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
The launch is expected to flag off the "new dawn" promised by
President Olusegun Obasanjo in his inaugural speech on May 29,
this year, according to Tuesday's "New Nigerian" newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Onyema Ugochuwu, a senior special assistant to
the president on National Orientation and Public Affairs, as
saying that the moral campaign was aimed at cleansing Nigeria of
all the vices that have bedeviled the country in recent years
such as corruption, dishonesty and lack of transparency in public
and private affairs.
</P>
<P>
Lamenting what he described as negative influences
institutionalized by years of military rule, he observed that
people have been viewing government with cynicism and skepticism
because past governments failed to keep faith with the people by
providing good governance.
</P>
<P>
The high level of corruption in Nigeria has even been elevated
to an official policy, he said. People openly demanded and
received bribes, he said, adding the culture of corruption has
scared away foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The president's aid said that the program of moral rebirth
would be launched as a demonstration of the president's
determination to eradicate such social ills to enable Nigeria to
move forward.

Rejecting Pakistan's demand that India pay a compensation of 60

cover up its misadventure in Kargil."

On the issue of India signing the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty, he said there was no change in the government's stand on

<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji met
with Willie Jimmy, deputy prime minister and minister of Trade,
Tourism and Business Development of Vanuatu, here this afternoon
at the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that bilateral ties between China and Vanuatu, a tiny
Pacific island, have witnessed smooth growth since the two forged
diplomatic ties in 1982. "With frequent high-level reciprocal
visits, the two countries have enhanced mutual understanding and
friendship, and bilateral cooperation in the economic, trade and
education sectors scored fruitful results," he said.
</P>
<P>
Vanuatu opened an honorary consulate in Beijing yesterday. Zhu
considered the move beneficial to make bilateral ties closer.
</P>
<P>
Both developing countries, China and Vanuatu share common views
in many global and regional affairs and have cooperated with each
other in international and regional organizations, including the
South-Pacific Forum (SPF), he said, adding that the further
enhancement of such ties were in the fundamental interests of the
two peoples.
</P>
<P>
The consolidation of ties between China and other developing
countries, including Vanuatu, constituted an important part of
China's foreign policy, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is willing to make concerted efforts
with the Vanuatu government to build long-term, stable, all-round
and healthy cooperative ties for the coming new century, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jimmy said that the smooth growth of bilateral ties between
Vanuatu and China should be attributed to the consensus between
the two nations to handle bilateral ties in accordance with the
norms of international relations.
</P>
<P>
He also extended gratitude for China's precious assistance and
support for his country, saying such assistance played a
significant role in promoting the social and economic development
of the island country.
</P>
<P>
Jimmy expressed the hope that China, as a dialog partner of the
SPF, will continue to play an active role in South-Pacific affairs.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also briefed the guests on China's political, economic and
social developments.

<P>
JAKARTA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- East Timor's direct ballot voter
turnout exceeded 95 percent, director of the U.N. electoral
advisory body Corrina Perelli told reporters in Dili, capital of
East Timor, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Based on the boxes collected from 193 of 220 ballot committees
until Tuesday morning, some 432,287 East Timorese, or 98.6 percent
of eligible voters, cast their vote during Monday's direct ballot.
</P>
<P>
"We can thus say that there was a massive turnout of voters,"
Perelli was quoted by the Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
She said tens of thousands of people who had fled their homes
and villages returned to vote.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that more than 451,000 of the 800,000 people in
East Timor were eligible to vote in the ballot.
</P>
<P>
Perelli said the ballot boxes were flown on Tuesday by U.N.
Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) helicopters from the districts to
the counting house, an old museum next to the central police
headquarters in Dili.
</P>
<P>
On the killing of Joel Lopez Gomez, a local U.N. staff member,

<HEADLINE> China  To Launch Putonghua Promotion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- China is to launch its second
national Putonghua (standard Chinese, also known as Mandarin)
promotion week in mid-September. Putonghua promotion activities
will be held at main streets in Chinese major cities.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Xinjun, a State Language Work Committee official said that
China has set a target of making Putonghua popular nationally by
the middle of the next century.
</P>
<P>
From last year the third week of September will be a regular
national Putonghua promotion week. This year's Putonghua promotion
dates from September 12 to 18, boasting the slogan: "Promoting
Putonghua, Welcoming the New Century".
</P>
<P>
China's linguist Zhou Youguang pointed out that there are two
criteria for judging Putonghua promotion: schools use it as campus
language, and Putonghua is the communication medium during public
activities. Investigations show that the popularity of Putonghua
has reached 80 percent in China's large and medium-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
The State Language Work Committee has recently started a
nationwide investigation on the usage of Chinese language to help
the country achieve its Putonghua promotion goal.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Exchange Drug Traffickers for Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Iran is to exchange jailed drug
traffickers for the safe return of four foreign tourists and their
Iranian guide taken hostages two weeks ago in the southeastern
province of Kerman.
</P>
<P>
Local Persian-language newspapers reported Tuesday that the
authorities have handed over two members of the Shah-Bakhsh tribe
to the police for the exchange later this week as demanded by the
abductors.
</P>
<P>
The two tribesmen are identified as Ghader Shah-Bakhsh and
Hussein Khassi-Farahani, both head of a major drug network. They
were arrested during a shoot-out with security forces in July,
which left five Shah-Bakhsh members dead.
</P>
<P>
The Shah-Bakhsh tribe is one of two major tribes near the
borders with Pakistan and Afghanistan, a region hard-hit by drug
trafficking. The tribe kidnaped four foreign tourists and their
Iranian guide on August 14 in retaliation for the police crackdown.
</P>
<P>
The four foreigners are two Spanish priests, 70-year-old
Joaquin Fernandez and 57-year-old Cosme Puerto, another Spaniard,
40-year-old Pedro Garcia, and Italian civil engineer Massimo
Cattabriga, 37. They were taken hostage from their hotel in
Kerman province.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the authorities and tribesmen have been
going on to secure their safe return. A provincial official said
the five hostages would be freed by the weekend, and their should
be no delay.
</P>
<P>
The tribe is also demanding the return of the bodies of those
killed in battle with the police, as well as a guarantee of
immunity from prosecution by the government, the papers here said.
</P>
<P>
The kidnapers and their captives have been "entirely
surrounded" by the police, but no action was taken to arrest
them, the papers added.

<HEADLINE> Lee Teng-hui's "Two States" Statement Severely Condemned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- An official from the Office for
Taiwan Affairs under the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of China has severely condemned Lee Teng-hui's "two states"
statement here today.
</P>
<P>
Under Lee's control, the weekend congress of the Kuomintang
passed a resolution to set the cross-Straits relation as "special
state-to-state relation"
</P>
<P>
Since Lee Teng-hui made the "two states" remarks on July 9, he
has been strongly criticized by the Chinese people, and the
international society has also repeated its adherence to the "one
China" policy.
</P>
<P>
However, Lee stubbornly advocated his "two states" remarks, and
went as far as putting it into the Kuomintang resolution document,
a very dangerous step aimed at separating China, said the official.
</P>
<P>
"As Lee travels farther on the splittist road, the Chinese
people including Taiwanese compatriots will firmly fight against
him, and Lee's splittist attempt is doomed to fail," the official
said.
</P>
<P>
His move of writing the "two states" remarks into party
documents will put an end to the future of the Kuomintang, and
push Taiwanese people to the abyss of war.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui has imposed his position on splitting China upon
the Kuomintang, which is a betrayal of not only the history of the
party, but also the Chinese nation, said the official.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that insightful members of the Kuomintang
can see through the dangerous nature of Lee Teng-hui's splittist
policy and act responsibly on behalf of the 22 million Taiwanese
compatriots.

<P>
JAKARTA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- East Timor Police Chief Col.
Timbul Silaen Tuesday requested five companies of police personnel
from the Indonesian Police to anticipate "the worst situation"
following the vote count on August 30.
</P>
<P>
According to the Antara News Agency, Silaen made the request
following his meeting with visiting Irish Foreign Affairs Minister
David Andrews, who visited Dili, capital of East Timor, as the
official ballot observer of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Silaen said some police personnel who have long served in East
Timor will be relieved.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has deployed about 20,000 policemen
and security personnel to safeguard the process of polling. A high
turnout of voters marked the United Nations-organized ballot on
the future of East Timor which ended remarkably peacefully on
Monday, defying fears of violence voiced by many.
</P>
<P>
However, East Timor Military District Commander Col. Noer Muis
was concerned over possible violence following the ballot.
</P>
<P>
"The post-ballot period will be a very critical stage since
neither of the two conflicting factions seems able to accept the
possibility of defeat. And this has been reflected by the numerous
clashes among their supporters during the campaigning," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Antara, ballot boxes began arriving in Dili on
Tuesday. The sealed boxes will be taken to the Dili Museum
building in Comoro, next to the building of the East Timor
regional police.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) spokesman David Wimhurst
said the results of the voting would be announced one week after
the ballot.
</P>
<P>
The referendum under an agreement among Indonesia, Portugal and
the United Nations was for voters to choose between special
autonomy within Indonesia and independence.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony annexed by Indonesia in
1976, has been seen by the U.N. General Assembly as a

<P>
MANILA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Senate has
approved for floor debate a bill seeking to impose a total ban on
commercial logging in a bid to allow the country's forest
resources to regenerate, the Philippine News Agency reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The approval came after the Senate Environment and Natural
Resources Committee filed a report on Monday to back the bill
which calls for a ban on commercial logging for the next 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The bill, also known as the proposed Sustainable Management of
Forest Resources Act, bans the commercial cutting of trees in all
types of forests in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
With the country losing 150,000 hectares of forest cover each
year, the bill's sponsor Loren Legarda warned that "by the turn of
the century, the country would have no old-growth forest left."
</P>
<P>
"This means we shall have no protection from the ravages of
flooding, siltation, erosion, loss of biodiversity and greenhouse
gases," she added.

JERUSALEM, August 31 (Xinhua) -- As shopping over the Internet
gains popularity, more and more consumers want to know how the
products feel that they are thinking of buying.
</P>
<P>
In order to meet this demand, a number of Israeli high
technology companies are working on realistic tactile sensation
technology, the latest issue of Israel Business Today magazine
said.
</P>
<P>
This technology will give an Internet user the ability to feel
the texture of a pair of corduroy pants or to test drive a new
car, feeling how it takes the curves, or accelerates.
</P>
<P>
Using this technology, almost all touch sensation can be
simulated, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
Companies working on realistic tactile sensation are reportedly
following up on work originally done by Stanford University and
the U.S. National Aeronautics Agency for force feedback
technology.
</P>
<P>
Israeli companies are using broadband technology and fast
Internet transmission, in a hope to achieve the super quick

technology to market.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Capability to Cope With Quake Very Limited: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 31 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli army official has
said that Israel can not cope with on its own an earthquake of the
scale that hit Turkey recently.
</P>
<P>
Local rescue teams will not be able to save all the people
trapped under buildings in case of a major earthquake in the
country, Colonel Uri Ben Yehuda of the Home Front Command of
Israeli army said.
</P>
<P>
Considering the rate that the Israeli rescue teams worked in
Turkey, which was hit by a 7.4-magnitude quake on August 17, such
teams would reportedly be able to save only about 200 people from
fallen buildings even though thousands were trapped, Haaretz daily
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ben Yehuda explained that rescue teams can only work in 60
buildings simultaneously, but that it is impossible to estimate
how much time will be needed to clear each building.
</P>
<P>
Ben Yehuda said that in case of a national disaster,
international assistance would be needed immediately and that
Israel would not be able to handle the situation on its own.
</P>
<P>
He added that since the Israeli army is geared to function
during wars, not natural disasters, a national concept will have
to be formulated.
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt that a central body is needed to deal with
large-scale disasters on the national level," he said.
</P>
<P>
Military sources also told Haaretz that they has recommended
that the government conduct "earthquake exercises," similar to
those conducted in Japan and the United States, but it rejected
the notion for fear that such exercises might cause panic.
</P>
<P>
In a recent report, Haaretz quoted a earthquake researcher as
saying that there might be a strong earthquake in the Dead Sea
area within the next twenty years, and a lot of old buildings in
Jerusalem could be damaged in the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the State Control Committee of Israeli Knesset
(parliament) has recently began a series of discussions on the
country's preparation for a strong earthquake.
</P>
<P>
And the committee is also expected to invite Prime Minister
Ehud Barak to brief the committee on the government's plan to
deal with the issue.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Decides to Grant Exporters Tax Holiday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has decided to grant all
exporters a tax holiday as part of the efforts to increase
exports, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision adopted on Monday during a ministerial meeting
under Prime Minister Kamal El-Ganzouri also applies to the
companies that have an independent budget for export activities,
the English-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The decision was aimed at encouraging companies to work in the
export and marketing fields, Cabinet Affairs Minister Talaat Ahmed
Hammad told reporters after the ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
Economists and exporters have expressed welcome to the measure
as a much-needed boost to Egypt's weak export sector, according to
the paper.
</P>
<P>
The government decision will primarily encourage manufacturers
who were concentrating on the domestic market to explore export
markets, David Shelbi, economist at brokerage house EFG-Hermes,
was quoted by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Others have described the move as excellent, voicing confidence
that it would enlarge Egypt's export volume.
</P>
<P>
But Shelbi said the decree will unlikely have a significant
short-term impact on the government revenue, given the small size
of Egypt's exports and an array of existing tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hammad announced a decision to form a committee of
the ministers of trade, economy, public enterprise, finance and
planning, plus the Central Bank governor, to study the creation of
a central unit to monitor trade statistics.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet sources said the proposed unit is to avoid having
different trade figures released by different ministries.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's exports stand at 1.015 billion U.S. dollars in the
third quarter of the 1998-99 fiscal year ending on June 30, down
from 1.028 billion dollars in the second quarter and 1.083 billion
dollars in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The total exports for the 1997-98 fiscal year were 5.13 billion
dollars, down from 5.35 billion dollars of the previous fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Government to Provide Loans for Poor Students (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- An experimental loan system for
poorer students is to be introduced in China which allows a 50-
percent discount on interest and a four-year repayment period
after graduation.
</P>
<P>
The scheme is jointly arranged by the People's Bank of China (
PBC), the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Finance, and will
be administered by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (
ICBC). It is launched as the new academic year begins this week.
</P>
<P>
According to education officials, the "pilot scheme" will
mainly benefit poor students attending a number of universities,
selected by the Education Ministry in the eight cities of Beijing,
Tianjin, Shanghai, Chongqing, Shenyang, Xi'an, Wuhan and Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
This preferential loan scheme has already won support from a
wide range of academic institutions and Min Weifang, vice-
president of Beijing University, one of the most prestigious
universities in China, said he was very pleased that the
government has demonstrated its commitment to the development of
education in such a way.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that one out of five Chinese college students
on campus is reckoned to be below the bottom line for living
standards set for local residents, and one out of every 10 is
considered to be extremely poor.
</P>
<P>
Min revealed that among the 26,000-plus students on his campus,
more than 2,800 were in a very difficult economic situation. "We
have spent over 82 million yuan (about one million U.S. dollars)
over the past two years on reducing tuition fees for poor students,
offering loans and scholarships.
</P>
<P>
"The university hoped to provide more help but it was beyond
its capability," Min said. He believes that this government-backed
student loan scheme will help cultivate the next generation of
professionals able to push forward China's economic and social
development, while encouraging more young people from less
developed areas to receive higher education.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows that a Chinese college student, mostly
supported by his or her family, has to pay an average of 48,000
yuan (nearly 5,800 U.S. dollars) for four years of higher
education.
</P>
<P>
The average annual income for a Chinese urban resident last
year was 5,425 yuan (about 654 U.S. dollars), and that for a
Chinese rural resident was 2,162 yuan (260 U.S. dollars).

<P>
Students who need such a bank loan will submit their
application to their universities for initial judgment who will
then pass them for approval by the Ministry of Education and then
to the ICBC for final checks.
</P>
<P>
A contract will then be drawn up between student and the ICBC
for the provision of the loan. There is also an extra special loan
facility which can be granted to those students whose families are
extremely poor.
</P>
<P>
Cui Jian, a student from the renowned Qinghua University, was
impressed that students will be given four years after graduation
to refund the loans and interest. "That eliminates a real dilemma
faced by poor students who are afraid of not being able to pay
back a loan."
</P>
<P>
Shang Fulin, vice-governor of the PBC, the central bank of
China, stressed that people who receive a college education will
have more choices in the employment market and can expect to be
better paid.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we believe, they will be fully capable of refunding
the loans and we are confident this scheme will be a success," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally Chinese people have demonstrated a strong desire
to save money for their children's schooling and the highest
proportion of savings is used this way.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Ministry of Education explained that when
the new system is perfected, the existing, wide variety of loans
provided by colleges and universities will be gradually phased out.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Ecuadorian President
Jamil Mahuad said here today that his current state visit to China
is successful.
</P>
<P>
Mahuad said at a news conference that he discussed some
international issues with Chinese President Jiang Zemin yesterday,
and reached wide consensus.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the Ecuadorian and Chinese governments
signed eight agreements including buyer's credit, free loans and
free assistance granted by China to Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also signed two important agreements on
cooperation in technical and agricultural areas, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"China has a huge and promising market," he added. However, he
pointed out that Ecuador has not made full use of this market
since the total trade volume between the two countries has been in
fluctuation and the mix of Ecuador's exports to China is so basic
that bananas and shrimps make up 98 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Both Ecuador and China have great interest in expanding their
two-way economic and trade cooperation," the president said,
adding that he welcomes Chinese enterprises to participate in
Ecuador's economic areas such as power, oil and telecommunications.

<HEADLINE> ICBC Launches New Consumer Credit Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China (ICBC) announced today that it will launch a series
of new consumer credit services in September in an effort to boost
consumption and support national economic growth.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the ICBC said that they will include government
aid loans to students, comprehensive consumer loans, loans for
home remodeling, loans for tourism and holidays, small personal
loans and loans to individuals for buying houses.
</P>
<P>
The government aid loans to students, to be launched on
September 1, will be granted to college students with financial
difficulties to help pay their tuition fees and living costs.
Borrowers of the loans will enjoy discounted interest with
subsidies from educational departments.
</P>
<P>
Individual comprehensive consumer loans do not specify the use
but require some equity support or mortgage guarantee, while small
personal loans do not require guarantee but are limited to no more
than one year and no more than 20,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Loans for tourism and holidays, home remodeling and houses all
require equity support or a mortgage.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the new credit services will be
introduced on a trial basis in some of the country's major cities,
and will be gradually extended nationwide to meet consumer demand.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Becomes  Light-Duty Automobile Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The city of Shenyang in
northeast China's Liaoning Province, an old heavy industrial base,
has grown into one of the main light-duty automobile production
centers in China, according to officials with the State Economic
and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the city now has over 120 automobile-
related firms and their automobile output this year is expected at
86,000 units. And their output value together with that of the
related industries is some 15 billion yuan (about 180 million U.S.
dollars). Light trucks, large and medium-sized passenger
automobile, and automobile engines are their main products.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang has now established cooperation with 20 of the top
automobile manufacturers in the world, including General Motors,
Mitsubishi, and Toyota, and has been improving product quality
with imported technology and machinery.
</P>
<P>
It has also developed new varieties of automobiles by utilizing
the introduced technology. One auto company, Jinke, has now
developed a new domestic product by incorporating imported high
technology from Toyota of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The sales volume of the Jinbei Automobile Company attached to
the No. 1 Automobile Manufacturing Group now accounts for over 90
percent of the city's total. And its market share for light-duty
passenger mini-bus has reached 16.6 percent, ranking the first
among all producers.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the State Administration of Machinery Industry
show that the country's total automobile output last year was
around 1.6 million units, about the same in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Local officials disclosed that they are negotiating with
General Motors and the Ford on cooperation for several key
projects over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
"We consider China as the market of the most strategic
importance both in Asia and in the world," said John Smith,
general manager of General Motors, the largest automobile producer
in the world.
</P>

<P>
ABU DHABI, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) and Oman will start issuing joint visas by October to
promote tourism and trade, according to a top Omani tourism
official.
</P>
<P>
"The proposal has been approved in principle by the
authorities concerned and a mechanism is being worked out to
ensure the complete success of this unique exercise in the
region," Omani Tourism Undersecretary Mohsin Bin Khamis Al Balushi
was quoted by the Gulf News as saying on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The issuance of joint visas is meant for tourists and business
people, the official said.

<P>
Calling the joint visa a "rare product designed to complement
and supplement each other," he said that Oman and the UAE are
bound by history and geography.
</P>

Oman-UAE ties received a further boost in May when the two
countries signed a historic border demarcation agreement. In
July, the Omani government allowed UAE nationals to own real
estates in the country.

Council (GCC) joining the fold for the good of the region," Al

<HEADLINE> Mirage Observed in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A splendid mirage stretching
several kilometers was reported in this capital city of northeast
China's Heilongjiang province at about 8:10 am on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon lasted about half an hour and buildings, forests,
and winding mountains were observed in the mirage.
</P>
<P>
Senior engineer Lu Deshi once observed mirage in east China's
Shandong province, and he watched the splendid vision yesterday
from his apartment. "The vision is not as clear as the one I saw
in Shandong, but the scenes had to be a mirage and could not be
clouds in different shapes because they never moved for half an
hour," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Mirage is usually seen in deserts or coastal areas and it is
very rare to be observed in cities for it requires special
conditions of sunlight and dusts and water contents in the air,
according to experts from the Heilongjiang Provincial
Meteorological Observatory.
</P>
<P>
The experts added that the recent continuous heavy rains in
Harbin could be a major reason behind the phenomenon of mirage.

HARBIN, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese surgeons have taken out a

When they found they could not drag the gall out of the
bellybutton as they did in normal practice because of the great
number and size of the stones in the patient's gall, the surgeons
used a special pump pipe to get rid of the bile in the gall and
then a nipper to pick out the stones.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Wishes to Expand Trade Ties with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadorian President Jamil
Mahuad said here on Tuesday that his government wishes to further
expand trade and economic cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
Attending an economic and trade seminar organized by the China
Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), the
president expressed the hope that his current state visit to China
will help further boost bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
"The Ecuadorian Government and people are highly interested in
strengthening economic relations with China," he said. "We also
pay close attention to the experience of China's economic growth,
which has enjoyed considerable development over the past 20 years.
"
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade between China and Ecuador has grown steadily
since the early 1990s, reaching as high as 150 million US dollars.
The trade volume was 147 million US dollars last year, down a
little from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Ecuadorian exports to China are mainly bananas and prawns,
whose export volume accounts for 98 percent of all exports to
China, according to the president.
</P>
<P>
He said Ecuador hopes to multiply its exports to China, and
export more fresh flowers and tropical fruits.
</P>
<P>
In terms of imports, Mahuad said Ecuador will purchase more
Chinese farm machines and construction machinery with credit loans
offered by China.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the president said his country welcomes Chinese
entrepreneurs to participate in Ecuador's privatization process in
the oil, electricity and telecommunications sectors, and in the
construction of airports, highways and ports.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin pledged on Monday during a talk
with Mahuad that China would vigorously support the development of
economic and trade relations in addition to pushing forward the
overall friendly ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China welcomes Ecuadorian entrepreneurs to
visit and invest in China, and will encourage its own firms to
invest in the Latin American country.
</P>
<P>
China and Ecuador signed several documents on Monday, mainly on
China-Ecuador cooperation in science and technology and in the
economic field.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 Chinese entrepreneurs from across the country and
30-plus Ecuadorian businessmen and officials accompanying the
president on the visit attended the seminar.

<HEADLINE> Nationalist Motive Suspected in Murder near West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police have launched
a wide-ranging investigation after two Israelis were found
murdered near the West Bank Monday, saying the possibility of a
nationalist motive behind the killing cannot not be ruled out.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak expressed shock Monday night
at the murder of Yehezkel Shai, 26, and his girlfriend, Sharon
Steinmetz, 21, and called on police to make every effort to catch
the perpetrators, Israel Radio said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the couple, who went on a hiking trip Sunday,
were found in the Megiddo area near the northern border of the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Northern region police chief Alik Ron told Israel Radio
that police were investigating all aspects and emphasizing the
possibility of a nationalist motive behind the killing.
</P>
<P>
Israel's security facilities have warned recently that militant
 Palestinian groups might renew their anti-Israel activity in an
attempt to derail the peace process, which the moderate
government of Barak and the Palestinians are trying to put back
on track.
</P>
<P>
Islamic groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which oppose
Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking, have killed scores of Israelis in
a series of terror attacks in Israel since 1993, when Israel
and the Palestinians signed the historic Oslo peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The local daily Haaretz said, however, that marks found on
the body of the murdered woman indicated that she had also
been raped. There have been no similar cases in the past
where members of Hamas or Islamic Jihad had combined acts of
rape with murders, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Steady Growth of Urbanization in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Editor's note: This year marks
the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of
China. Over the past five decades, China's achievements in all
economic sectors have attracted worldwide attention.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua News Agency is to release about 20 stories about the
nation's economy. The first of the series was released on August
17. This is the eleventh.
</P>
<P>
Urbanization has been expanding rapidly in China over the past
50 years since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, with
the number of cities rising from 132 in 1949 to 668 at present,
according to the Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the number of cities with a population of
more than 500,000 each increased from 12 to 81 in the past five
decades. And the country's urban population now accounts for 30
percent of the nation's total, up from 12 percent 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Ministry of Construction said that small cities
with a population of less than 200,000 each developed most rapidly
over the past 20 years, signaling a boom in the rural economic
development which has ushered in the urbanization.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said that the reform and opening-up policy adopted
at the end of 1978 has greatly stimulated rural economic
development, particularly in the coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the country's urbanization development strategy has
paid off by controlling the development of large cities and giving
rational development to small and medium-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
Ministry sources also said that the area of Chinese cities has
been expanding over the past 50 years, and now accounts for 18
percent of the country's total land area, as against 7.6 percent
in 1984. The suburban counties around major cities such as Beijing,
Shanghai, Tianjin, Harbin, Wuhan, Nanjing, and Guangzhou, as well
as other cities, have developed into satellite cities and towns
over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, city groups centering on very large metropolises
have come into being in recent years, including those in the delta
areas of the Yangtze River, the Pearl River, and the Bohai Rim
areas.
</P>
<P>
However, uneven economic development has resulted in an uneven
distribution of cities between eastern and western China.
</P>
<P>
To speed up urbanization in western China, the government has
taken a series of encouraging policies to support the development
of large cities in this region in a bid to bring about development
of the surrounding small and medium-size cities.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Shuts Down Hamas Office, 12 Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Jordan shut down the Amman office
of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in a
surprise move Monday, arrested 12 of its members and put four
senior Hamas leaders on its wanted list.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown was carried out because the Hamas office,
registered as a business office in Amman, and its members "had
been involved in activities incompatible with their licenses," the
semiofficial Jordan Times quoted officials from the interior
ministry as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Police rounded up 12 Hamas activists and issued arrest warrants
to four Hamas leaders who are currently outside Amman on a visit
to Iran, the Jordan Times said.
</P>
<P>
The warrants were issued against Hamas spokesman Ibrahim
Ghosheh, former poliburo chief Musa Abu Marzouk, current leader
of the movement`s poliburo khaled Misha`al and Hamas
representative in Jordan Mohammad Nazzal.
</P>
<P>
In a separate move on Monday, the Jordanian police also shut
down the Amman bureau of the "Palestinian Al Muslemah," a Hamas
-affiliated organization.
</P>
<P>
It's not immediately clear whether the Jordanian authorities
had consulted with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who is also a
close personal friend of Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein,
before the shutdown and the arrest.
</P>
<P>
Hamas is known as a militant Palestinian organization which
opposes making peace with Israel but stands for a "holy war" to
liberate all Palestinian territories and establish an Islamic
state.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is a staunch supporter of the Palestinians but called
for an early resumption of peace talks between Israel and the
Palestinians as well as Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, becoming the
second Arab country after Egypt to strike a peace treaty with the
Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> UAE Sends Ambulances to Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen ambulances donated by
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to the people of Bosnia could
reach them by mid-September, the Gulf News daily reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ambulances, which cost 500,000 U.S. dollars, will be the
first ambulances that some Bosnian cities will have had since the
end of the Bosnian war in 1995, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to Nasr Ishak, senior liaison officer in Abu Dhabi
for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), the
UNHCR will possibly hand over the ambulances to Sarajevo on
September 18.
</P>
<P>
But the final decision has to be made after further
consultation between the parties concerned, namely the Zayed
Foundation, which donated the ambulances, the Bosnian government
and the UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
"The 15 ambulances have been built to specifications for
the Bosnian situation," the UNHCR official said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Zayed Foundation's donation of the
ambulances to Bosnia has set the stage for further cooperation
between the UAE and the UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
The foundation has been invited to take part in the
UNHCR-organized non-government organization conference in Geneva in
October, he said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Govt to Impose 30 Pc Duty on Imported Ceramics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
agreed to impose 30 percent duty on imported ceramics products,
press reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This agreement was reached recently after a series of meetings
between the Bangladesh Ceramic Wares Manufacturers' Association
(BCWMA) and the National Board of Revenue and other government
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Low-quality and cheap-rated foreign ceramic products are now
flooding the local market posing a serious threat to the country's
export-earning ceramics producers, the BCWMA alleged.
</P>
<P>
The ceramic industry is a fledging one in this South Asian
country, and as a non-traditional item, ceramic at this moment is
a major exportable item having a high degree of value addition.
</P>
<P>
The earnings from different types of table-ware, kitchenware of
porcelain or china and articles other than porcelain exports stood
at 2.5 billion taka (about 550.5 million U.S. dollars) in the
1998-99 fiscal year ending on June 30.

<P>
SHENYANG, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province, a heavy
industrial in northeast China, has named its first group of five
special inspectors to examine and supervise ten key State
enterprises in the province.
</P>
<P>
The province also named another 19 assistant inspectors for the
task, who have completed their training together with the special
inspectors at Qinghua University, and they have begun their
inspection tour around the province.
</P>
<P>
Dispatching special inspectors is an important measure adopted
by the Chinese government to deepen the reform of State-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The State Council dispatched such inspectors to several large
State enterprises last year and this has yielded good results.
</P>
<P>
Home to nearly 500 State enterprises, Liaoning has attracted
wide attention in reforming its debt-ridden State sector.
</P>
<P>
Lack of supervision of enterprise managers has been a
persistent problem facing the State sector, and the special
inspectors will audit the financial books of these enterprises and
evaluate the work of the managers.

<HEADLINE> Internet Links Farmers With Wider Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese farmers used to
suffer from a lack of information, and this often led to a
terrible waste of farm produce and other agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
However, this situation has been ameliorated by the Chinese
Agriculture Information Network, an Internet website created by
the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
At the address: www.agri.gov.cn, which was registered on the
Internet in 1996, surfers can discover an ocean of agricultural
information.
</P>
<P>
The information includes the development of agricultural
products and capital goods in the agricultural sector, analyses of
the international agricultural market, import and export analysis,
as well as new technologies on crops planting, livestock, and
aquatic breeding.
</P>
<P>
An official from the ministry noted that the website has
received 214,000 visitors so far and that the information so
provided has benefited thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
"Internet links my piglets with a wider market," said Li
Minghui, a farmer in north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
"It's the network that gave me valuable information on the
market prices of the piglets and brought me a large profit of some
100,000 yuan," Li added.
</P>
<P>
Like Li, an increasing number of farmers run their businesses
by employing the Internet nowadays.
</P>
<P>
In Lingxian County in east China's Shandong Province, though
the farmers there have has access to the Internet for only three
months, they already have gained 40 million yuan in profit by
selling garlic, garlic bolts and other vegetables through via the
network this year.
</P>
<P>
The Jinfeng pear, a specialty of Zongzhai Town in northwest
China's Gansu Province, in the past had trouble finding a market
despite its superior quality. This year, the farmers have
contacted prospective buyers on-line even before the fruit matured.
</P>
<P>
At the First On-line Grain Fair of China this January, the
turnover reached 3.3 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural network on the Internet has a promising future,
and ministry sources said that access to the website has spread to
more than 2,000 counties and villages nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Approximately one million farmers obtain on-line information
nowadays to plant cash crops, and half a million to raise
livestock and poultry. And the network has helped spread more than
5,000 new agro-technologies and new varieties so far, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The increasing popularity of the Internet among Chinese farmers
will further facilitate agricultural modernization in China, said
Xu Fengxian, researcher with the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences.

<HEADLINE> Brushfires Plague Southern California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Firefighters Monday battled
brushfires all over southern California that have scorched
thousands of acres, forced evacuations, damaged buildings and
posed a threat to power lines.
</P>
<P>
Officials said efforts to extinguish the fires were hampered by
strong, erratic winds, steep terrains, and a recent heat wave that
sent temperatures soaring to 100 Fahrenheit degrees.
</P>
<P>
One blaze, near Lake Arrowhead, about 75 miles east of Los
Angeles, has consumed 17,000 acres of brush and forest in an area
called Apply Valley.
</P>
<P>
About 400 residents, hikers, campers and vacationers were
evacuated over the weekend. Thirty structures were burned.
</P>
<P>
Together, the fires have burned more than 51,000 acres Monday
in southern California, according to California Department of
Forestry.
</P>
<P>
Wind-driven wildfires Monday also burned more than 50,000 acres
of timber, dry brush and cactus in other five western states of
Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Utah and Washington.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the National Fire Information Center in Boise,
Idaho, said the chain of blazes across the western U.S. states
over the past week had pushed the total amount of land burned this
year to more than four million acres -- almost double the annual
average for the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Janelle Smith, a center spokeswoman, said that two years of
weather disruptions caused by the El Nino and La Nina phenomena
were partially to blame, with dry summers leaving much of the
south and east unusually fire-prone and damp winters in the
northwest leaving forests and hillsides thick with the scrubby
growth that fuels forest fires.

TOKYO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Japan's unemployment rate stayed
at a record high 4.9 percent for the second straight month in July,
with female joblessness worsening slightly, the Management and
Coordination Agency said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
From last year to July, the number of unemployed rose by 490,
000 to 3.19 million, and the number of employed dropped by 800,000
to 64.97 million for the 18th consecutive month of decline, the

The seasonally-adjusted jobless rate for women rose by 0.2
percentage to 4.6 percent in July, while that for men remained at
a record high of 5.1 percent, a preliminary report by the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
An agency official said some bright aspects of employment are
emerging, but an immediate improvement is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
Another report by Japan's Labor Ministry said the ratio of job
offers to job seekers was 0.46 in July, the same as in the
previous month, meaning there were 46 job offers for every 100 job
seekers.
</P>
<P>
Compared with last year, job offers rose in sectors such as
construction, telecommunications, transport, service and real
estate, but dropped in the manufacturing sector, the ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Encephalitis Toll Hits 150 in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 31 (Xinhua) -- At least 150 people have died
from the Japanese Encephalitis (JE) throughout Nepal so far since
the onset of monsoon season, The Kathmandu Post quoted the
Department of Health Services as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The highly affected areas are the Terai plain in south-western
Nepal, with 98 deaths reported from the region. Kathmandu does not
have any reported cases so far.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Encephalitis, a vector borne disease, emerges with the
onset of warm rainy season and flares up throughout monsoon. JE
virus is carried by mosquito that is infected from biting pigs.
Pigeons, ducks and horses can also serve as host to JE virus. The
early symptoms are fever, headache, nausea and vomiting which may
end up as paralysis in later stages.
</P>
<P>
According to epidemiological analysis prepared by the World
Health Organization in Nepal in 1998, more than 11.5 million
people are at constant risk of JE in Nepal. The most affected
areas are primarily the southern plains that are inhabited by the
Tharu community since they raise pigs.
</P>
<P>
The early action that can be taken to prevent the disease is
vaccination. There are no effective treatment after the disease
strikes.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Implement Master Plan to Reduce Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is to implement a
10-year master plan to reduce its poverty rate by uplifting the
living standard of its rural population, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the master plan, a countrywide survey had been
conducted to gather data on industries and the availability of
resources such as raw materials, agro-resources, minerals and
manpower, said a spokesman for the Ministry of Vocational Training
and Rural Industries.
</P>
<P>
The plan, funded by the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP), will be implemented by the Ministry of Vocational Training
and Rural Industries under the auspices of the International Labor
Organization.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman did not specify how much money will be
needed to implement the plan.
</P>
<P>
According to a UNDP report on Sri Lanka, the poverty rate in
the country was 18 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
But Sri Lanka's Department of Census and Statistics said in a
recent report that about 40 percent of the country's population
live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
The report said nearly half of Sri Lanka's population of 18.5
million live without access to electricity. In some districts, 80
percent of the population have no access to electricity.
</P>
<P>
Access to safe drinking water is out of reach for over a
quarter of the population, leading to the rapid spread of
diarrhea, cholera and other diseases, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Rate Rises to 5.7 Percent in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate in
Thailand rose to 5.7 percent at the end of May this year, and one
in every 12 workers lost jobs or could not find work during the
past three months, the Bangkok Post reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a government report as saying that the
unemployment rate in Thailand has now tripled since the end of
1996, as two years of recession, a real estate market slump and
cost-cutting by companies have left 1.87 million people out of
work.
</P>
<P>
The inability of new high-school and college graduates to find
work swelled the jobless queues, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda was quoted as
saying that though absolute unemployment in Thailand had risen,
the pace of the increase had slowed considerably.
</P>
<P>
He said two government spending packages in the past five
months have helped some people find jobs.
</P>
<P>
There had been an improvement among commercial service
providers and small businesses, he said, acknowledging that
construction workers had been severely affected.
</P>
<P>
The workforce of Thailand as of May 31 this year was 33.08
million, or 54 percent of the total population.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government announced a 1.5-billion-U.S.-dollar program
in March to create about 500,000 jobs, mostly for unskilled
laborers to build public works.
</P>
<P>
The government report said the program should help reduce the
jobless rate to 4.2 percent by the year's end.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Experts Hired to Supervise Three Gorges Project (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A group of experts from the
Harza Company of the United States were invited today to inspect
the Three Gorges Project at the middle reaches of the Yangtze
River for a second time.
</P>
<P>
These experts may be hired to supervise the construction of
the world's largest water control project, the Three Gorges
Project, which combines hydroelectric power generation and
navigation functions, will cost 203.9 billion yuan and will take
17 years to complete.
</P>
<P>
At the construction site of the Three Gorges Project, their
countryman, Mick Mckinon, has been working attentively from a
platform more than 100 meters above the ground.
</P>
<P>
Mckinon is just one of the first five foreign supervisors who
have been hired from the Atkinson Construction Company of the U.S.
since last May by the China Yangtze River Three Gorges Project
Development Corporation to supervise concrete pouring for the
mammoth dam on the Yangtze and consult in this regard.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the developer has also signed a contract with
an alliance formed by the National Power Company of France and the
French Technical Supervision Bureau to hire experts there to
supervise the manufacture of the project's first 14 generators in
Canada and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the five American supervisors hired for the
Three Gorges Project, a dozen supervisors were also hired from
the French alliance to work in the factories of Canada and Brazil
to oversee the manufacture of the generators.
</P>
<P>
The Harza Company has been busy discussing details with the
Three Gorges Project developer about consultancy and supervision
of the project.
</P>
<P>
There are clear advantages to hiring foreign supervisors to
stem corruption in construction activities.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, He Gong, deputy general manager of the China Yangtze
River Three Gorges Project Development Corporation, said, "Hiring
foreign supervisors is conducive to coordinating relations between
the developer and foreign equipment contractors, and foreign
supervisors can set forth more objective suggestions as they are
not easily affected by external factors."
</P>
<P>
Whenever major problems occur, reports from the foreign
supervisors will be submitted directly to the Three Gorges Project
Committee of the State Council, which is currently headed by
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Tightens Security Around Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's authorities
tightened security outside Congress to prevent more violence
between supporters and opponents of President Hugo Chavez.
</P>
<P>
The measure was taken after scores of Chavez's supporters and
opponents clashed outside Congress where the Constitutional
National Assembly (ANC) is scheduled to examine a possible
modification of the decree of legislative emergency. Thirty people
were injured in the clash.
</P>
<P>
The clash happened when supporters of Chavez and security
forces stopped opposition legislators from jumping the gate of the
legislative headquarters to meet their supporters.
</P>
<P>
Under the order, police force and the National Guard were
posted outside the Congress building, where the pros and cons of
Chavez shouted rival slogans. The ANC is elected through a
nationwide poll under a decree of Chavez to spearhead the country'
s economic and political reforms.
</P>
<P>
ANC President Luis Maquileana, a supporter of Chavez, warned
against a repeating of the violence, which he said was instigated
by the opposition.

<HEADLINE> Poorest Villages in Northwest China Now Well-off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A total of 52 villages in the
Guyuan region of northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region,
formerly known as the poorest area in China, have achieved the
goal of leading a well-to-do life.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, the local government has succeeded in lifting many
villages out of poverty and has continued to help them improve
their lives.
</P>
<P>
It began by choosing some villages with comparatively better
natural conditions and economic foundations as experimental units
to develop their economy.
</P>
<P>
Within seven years, the number of such villages has increased
to 180, with a population of 320,000.
</P>
<P>
Now, the per capita net income of these experimental villages
has risen from 455 yuan to 2,235 yuan a year, and 52 of them are
now considered the well-to-do.
</P>
<P>
For the past seven years, the local government has helped these
villages make the best use of their advantages in geographic
location and resources.
</P>
<P>
For instance, Shanmin village in Xijie County has encouraged
every family to enter the business of cattle and sheep butchering
and transporting.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the village now earns more than 6.6 million yuan a
year, and the net income per family exceeds 10,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Libao village in Haiyuan County has made great efforts to
develop forestry by using Yellow River water, and its per capita
net income last year reached 3,950 yuan.

<HEADLINE> ADB President Praises Sino-ADB Relationship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABIDJAN, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The African Development Bank (
ADB) President Omar Kabbaj praised Sino-ADB relations in a recent
interview, and expressed his thanks for China's contribution in
the development of friendly relations and top-quality cooperation
between the sides.
</P>
<P>
Kabbaj said that China, since it joined ADB in 1985, has
continued to provide aid to African nations, which completely
fulfill the spirit of South-South cooperation. China selflessly
shares its advanced technology and experience with many African
nations, and during the cooperation with ADB, Chinese companies
have played a positive role in basic projects in poverty-
alleviation, which are considered a model of South-South
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China is one of ADB's early shareholders, which owns a one
percent share in the bank and has a 0.778 percent vote in the ADB
board. During the cooperation with the ADB, China has offered the
African Development Fund donations amounting to 185 million U.S.
dollars and contributed to helping people from 39 African nations
escape from poverty, he added.
</P>
<P>
The ADB president also recalled his visit to China in 1997,
saying that his meetings with Chinese leaders and communion with
Chinese enterprises have promoted mutual friendship between China
and the ADB. He expressed admiration for the social and economic
progress China has made in its 20 years of reforms and opening up,
saying that China has found its way to development by establishing
a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
He particularly expressed his appreciation for China's role as
a responsible country during the Asian financial crisis, which
managed to prevent the devaluation of the RMB yuan, and said this
wise and far-sighted measure has helped affected countries to
restore their confidence and end the crisis at an early date.

<HEADLINE>   Men's Doubles Team Expected to do Well in Indonesia Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's new partnerships in
the men's doubles are expected to create surprises in the 150,000
U.S.dollars Sanyo Indonesia Open, which will start in Bali on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) national training
director Christian Hadinata said the new pairs of Flandy Limpele
and Wahyu Agung and another pair of Antonius and Halim Heryanto
have a good chance to reach the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
"Both sudden doubles have a great chance to create surprises.
We can see from Agung's performance in the men's doubles during
the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Brunei Darussalam early
this month that he plays better in the men's doubles than in his
specialty of mixed doubles. I hope he can maintain his performance
in the men's doubles as he did in the Games," Christian was quoted
by The Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Christian said top seeded Candra and Tony must be aware of Thai
pair Pramote Teerawiwatana and Tesana Pansisavas, SEA Games gold
medalists, if they meet in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian old hands Ricky Subagja and Rexy Mainaky, a 1996
Olympics gold medalists, will most likely face Swedish number one
pair Peter Axelsson and Par-Gunnar Jonsson in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
"So far, Ricky and Rexy have never lost to the Swedes. I hope
they can maintain the tradition. But I'm a bit worried as I see
they lack motivation compared to the Swedish pair," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the men's singles, Christian saw two players -- Ronny
Agustinus and Marlev Mainaky -- as the dark horses in the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
"They both are potentially a threat to their opponents,
especially the European players. Ronny and Marlev are very good
both in offense and defense. They also have good posture. But they
need to improve their physical condition as their type of playing
is really demanding," he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Officials, International Observers Praise E. Timor Ballot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian officials and
international observers praised the largely peaceful direct ballot
held in East Timor on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Over 90 percent of the 451,000 registered voters turned out at
polling booths, with the U.N. Mission in East Timor (UNAMET)
calling the day "very successful."
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Post said Tuesday that tension and isolated
incidents marked some areas, including seven polling stations that
had to suspend operations due to security concerns.
</P>
<P>
A local staff member of UNAMET was stabbed to death outside a
polling booth in Atsabe, Ermera, late Monday, the report said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special emissary for East
Timor Jamsheed Marker expressed satisfaction with the conduct of
the direct ballot, saying it had proceeded in a "fair, free and
secret" manner.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters in Dili, capital of East Timor, that Annan
had extended warm congratulations to the East Timorese on the
smooth conduct of the direct ballot.
</P>
<P>
In Jakarta, Indonesian Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Alatas
said he was filled with "hopeful anticipation."
</P>
<P>
However, he added that it was too soon to say he was
"relieved."
</P>
<P>
Alatas said the government's position was to encourage the East
Timorese to remain part of Indonesia, but he reiterated the
government's commitment to abiding by the results of the vote.
</P>
<P>
"After personally spending so much time on efforts to find a
comprehensive and just solution to the East Timor question, of
course I'm very happy that finally the opportunity has arrived for
such a solution," The Jakarta Post quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Military Commander Gen. Wiranto praised the UNAMET
for peacefully conducting the ballot.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen smooth balloting at hundreds of polling centers
and only a minor incident that happened away from the stations,"
he said after attending a meeting of the Council for the Upholding
of Security and Law here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesian Army Chief of Staff General Subagyo
Hadisiswoyo said the headquarters of East Timor's military command
would be moved to Ende in Flores Island following the ballot.
</P>
<P>
"The army military units concerned are making the necessary
preparations for the command headquarters' move to Ende in Flores
Island," he said, adding that the East Timor command's
headquarters would be moved regardless of the results of the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
UNAMET chief electoral officer Jeff Fischer said the vote count
will start after all ballot boxes arrive in Dili Tuesday
afternoon. It will take UNAMET a week to finish the count.
</P>
<P>
The ballot count would be a transparent affair and
representatives of observers and both factions would be allowed to
witness the process, he added.
</P>
<P>
The August 30 ballot will allow the East Timorese to choose
whether their homeland should become an autonomous region within
Indonesia or totally independent.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United
Nations, which still considers Portugal as the administering power
of the territory.

<HEADLINE> Profile: China's First Female Archaeologist (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Without Zheng Zhenxiang, the
tomb dating back to the Shang Dynasty (16th-11th century BC) would
not have been unearthed in 1976 in the city of Anyang in central
China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
Zheng is the first female archeological research fellow of new
China, which was founded in 1949, and she has spent 36 years
excavating the Yin Ruins, the ancient capital of the Shang Dynasty,
buried under Anyang.
</P>
<P>
The occupant of the tomb uncovered in 1976 was Fu Hao, one of
the queens of the Shang Dynasty, regarded as the first female
general in Chinese history. With a high position, she often
presided over sacrificial ceremonies and directed military actions,
according to the inscriptions on the bones and tortoise shells
discovered in Anyang.
</P>
<P>
"What impressed me most in my life was finding Fu Hao's tomb,"
Zheng recalled.
</P>
<P>
In 1976, Zheng organized an excavation of a palace site in the
Yin Ruins, only to find that the bottom of the foundation of the
palace couldn't be reached, even after they had dug five meters
deep, and nothing was found over the next month.
</P>
<P>
Many experts advised her to stop, because according to the
traditional theory, there would not be a tomb in the area of a
palace.
</P>
<P>
However, Zheng Zhenxiang didn't think so. She sensed that there
must be a tomb beneath the palace. She then challenged the
traditional theory by innovative technology and hard work.
</P>
<P>
As her reward, the tomb was discovered. "If I was affected by
the traditional theory and changed my mind," she said, "there
would have been no chance to unearth the tomb."
</P>
<P>
Thus a treasure trove was opened by Zheng. About 2,000 articles
buried with the queen, including 400 bronzeware and 700 jade
articles, were found. One piece of bronzeware inscribed with the
words "Fu Hao" proved Zheng was correct.

<HEADLINE> Guoqing: Favorite Name with Chinese (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Though trouble sometimes arises
due to the great numbers of namesakes, Lu Guoqing, a clerk at the
Shanghai Municipal Personnel Bureau, has always been proud of his
name.
</P>
<P>
"I was born on the same day as the People's Republic of China,
so my parents named me Guoqing, meaning celebrating the birth of
the nation," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Lu's mother, Xi Shangyi, now 74, still feels the thrilling joy
she felt as she gave birth to her son on October 1, 1949, when Mao
Zedong declared the founding of the People's Republic in Beijing,
marking the end of a century in which colonialists and
imperialists collaborated with feudal rulers to enslave the
Chinese people, and the end to a time of chaos caused by frequent
civil wars and foreign aggression.
</P>
<P>
"The name Guoqing embodies our great joy and pride in the birth
of both our son and of New China and our hope that he would grow
up strong and sturdy as the nation would," Xi said.
</P>
<P>
Lu has since experienced all the major changes that have taken
place in China. He went to school until 1966 when the ten-year-
long chaotic Cultural Revolution started, became a worker at the
Shanghai No.1 Steelworks in 1968, entered a college in 1978 when
the country introduced reform and opening up policies, and then
became a public servant in China's leading industrial and
commercial city of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
His experiences reflect the ups and downs of the nation, Lu
said, adding that he believes a brighter future is in store for
him as China is now well on the way to a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Guoqing is a favorite name with Chinese. One can easily find a
Guoqing among relatives, friends or other acquaintances, and there
is even a long list of Guoqings among famous people, including
athlete Li Guoqing, model soldier Zhao Guoqing, and pop singers
Cai Guoqing and Sun Guoqing.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that Shanghai alone now has more than
6,800 Guoqings who were all born on or around October 1.

<P>
Based on the discovered weapons, Zheng concluded that Fu Hao
was slender but robust, and had mastered martial arts. Most
probably, she was stronger than male generals.
</P>
<P>
This discovery must be ascribed to Zheng's unremitting efforts.
In fact, Zheng Zhenxiang is "another Fu Hao," a distinguished
general in the archeological community.
</P>
<P>
Zheng entered Beijing University in 1950. "New China gave me
the chance to go to university. That was the greatest luck for me,
" she said.
</P>
<P>
In 1962, leaving the university as China's first postgraduate
in archeology, Zheng came to the Yin Ruins as a research
archeologist.
</P>
<P>
The Yin Ruins, with a history of 273 years as the Shang capital,
was first discovered by Chinese scholars in 1928.
</P>
<P>
As the first archeological research fellow in China, Zheng
Zhenxiang witnessed the development of this field, especially the
archeological development of the Yin Ruins.
</P>
<P>
The first institute specially devoted to archeological research
was set up in the Chinese Academy of Science in 1950. Later, it
built a station in Anyang, and thus resumed the excavation of the
Yin Ruins, which had been interrupted by the Japanese aggression
in 1936.
</P>
<P>
Now, Chinese archeologists have defined the distribution of the
royal temple, palace, tomb, residential quarters and clustering
locations of a once-thriving handicraft industry.
</P>
<P>
The Yin Ruins have attracted many noted archeologists, but
Zheng Zhenxiang remains number one among them. The well-preserved
Fu Hao Tomb that she discovered is now known as "the small
encyclopedia of the Yin Ruins."
</P>
<P>
Zheng Zhenxiang, now 69, said: "It's my duty to assure that
people gain a thorough and objective understanding of the Yin
Ruins."
</P>
<P>
In a bid to fulfill this duty, Zheng, now retired, has remained
in Anyang in charge of the excavation of another palace.

<P>
Chinese are very particular about choosing names, and a Chinese
name usually reflects the features of the times and the hopes the
parents place in the child, noted Ding Shuimu, a sociologist and
researcher at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Guoqings may be of different ages, from different families and
different experiences, but all of them bear the same name
signifying their parents' rosy hopes for the younger generation
and their pride in New China, Ding added, and all Guoqings have
witnessed the progress of the country.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guoqing, about 30, is still luckier than older Guoqings,
for when he reached school age, China was about to launch the
reform and opening up campaign and enter its fastest-growing
period. He continued his education until graduating from Tongji
University, one of the country's prestigious institutes of higher
learning.
</P>
<P>
Now marketing manager of the Hong Kong-based China Resources (
Holdings) Co., Ltd., Shi is engaged in real estate development in
the Pudong New Area, an emerging financial and trade zone in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"I live at the right time and I'll do my best to be worthy of
the name," Shi said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Guoqing, born on August 25 this year in central China's
Hubei Province, more than a month before National Day, is now one
of the youngest Guoqings.
</P>
<P>
"The name implies our full confidence in China turning into a
strong and prosperous nation in the coming century," said his
father Chen Hong.

<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The scenic coastal city of Dalian
in northeast China's Liaoning Province has received a record
number of tourists this summer.
</P>
<P>
Tourist arrivals by train and ship exceeded 850,000 this season,
and overseas tourists also increased steadily. The number of
Japanese sightseers, for example, rose by 20 percent over last
year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, about 90 percent of the luxury hotel rooms were
occupied, an increase of ten percent over last year, and common
guesthouses were in short supply.
</P>
<P>
Local tourist officials said Dalian also has become the first
choice for summer vacations for some multinational corporations,
and people on self-financed family trips to Dalian accounted for
about 20 percent of all visitors, compared to four percent in
previous years.
</P>
<P>
This thriving tourism is a result of sustained efforts in city
construction and beautification. Also, a series of tourism
promotion fairs including the international costume festival,
fireworks festival, and romantic tours enhanced Dalian's
reputation as an ideal tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
A series of projects for submarine sightseeing, rock climbing,
and some adventure games are still in the planning stage to make
Dalian even more attractive to potential tourists.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Economic and Technological
Development Zone (ETDZ) here in the capital of China has
introduced an additional set of ten preferential policies to
attract more hi-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
These incentives include the early adoption of a set of
regulations on land leasing, which will approve leasing land-use
rights for individuals and reduce land-leasing fees, the setting
up of a special service center for hi-tech companies to improve
the investment climate, and preferential treatment in utilities
charges.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the general preferential policies for businesses
in the ETDZ and State-level new and high technology development
zones, large projects with high technologies and good
profitability in the development zone will also enjoy preferential
treatment in leasing land, procuring factory buildings, and rent
exemptions for research development centers.
</P>
<P>
The management of the development zone is also expected to set
up a special investment fund estimated at between 20 million and
30 million yuan to support hi-tech ventures in the zone.
</P>
<P>
Employees of these ventures, if defined as technicians and
managers in urgent need, will be allowed to register for
permanent residence along with their family members.
</P>
<P>
A total of 379 enterprises, including 144 overseas-funded ones,
were operating in the development zone by the end of June,
involving a total investment of 1.817 billion US dollars.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Workers Pouring Concrete at Three Gorges Dam (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The construction of the Three
Gorges Project at the middle reaches of the Yangtze River has
entered its most critical stage in terms of labor intensity and
technical difficulty.
</P>
<P>
So said He Gong, deputy general manager of the China Yangtze
Three Gorges Project Development Corporation, the dam's developer,
in a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
According to He, workers are now engaged in pouring concrete
for the dam, as concrete is needed for the permanent ship lock,
the riverbed dam, and the power plants on the left bank of the
Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of concrete necessary for the main works of
the Three Gorges Project is well over 27 million cu m, the largest
of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
By late July, workers had poured more than three million cu m
of concrete, dug 18 million cu m of earth and stone, and refilled
another eight million cu m of earth and stone. In accordance with
the construction plan, four million cu m of concrete will have
been poured, and 11.3 billion yuan will be spent this year.
</P>
<P>
"The monthly concrete pouring volume is expected to exceed 500,
000 cu m in August, the highest level in the world, but in June
and in July, the monthly volume was below 400,000 cu m because of
the hot weather," said He.
</P>
<P>
The gigantic Three Gorges Project will be built in three stages,
will cost well over 203.9 billion yuan, and when completed will be
capable of generating 84.7 billion kwh of electricity a year.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the dam began in 1993, and the second phase of
the construction was inaugurated by the successful damming of the
main stream of the Yangtze in November 1997. During the second
phase, which will end in 2003, the first generating unit will be
made ready for power generation and the permanent ship lock will
also be ready for traffic.
</P>
<P>
"The greatest challenge in building the dam is how to ensure
the fulfillment of the concrete pouring plan and the quality of
the work simultaneously," said the deputy manager, adding that the
coming winter will test the quality of the concrete work done this
summer.

<HEADLINE> Workers Pouring Concrete at Three Gorges Dam (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the meantime, a total of 240,000 tons of metallic structures
will be erected or repaired during the second stage, and a turbo-
generator with a generating capacity of 700,000 kw will also be
installed during the second stage.
</P>
<P>
To solve possible technical difficulties in constructing the
Three Gorges Dam, the China Yangtze Three Gorges Project
Development Corporation has spent about 1.2 billion yuan on
scientific research and signed 623 contracts with scientific and
technological institutes.
</P>
<P>
A number of scientific and technological achievements have
resulted from this endeavor, greatly aiding the second-stage
construction.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang Pusheng, supervisor-in-chief for construction
of the Three Gorges Project, it is still difficult to predict how
long the concrete structures will last because concrete appeared
just 200 years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, Chinese scientists and technicians are endeavoring to
assure that the Three Gorges Dam may last for ever.
</P>
<P>
They have carried out long-term comparisons and experiments to
learn all they could about the properties of concrete, and have
introduced a complete quality control system covering raw
materials, mixing, transport, pouring, temperature control and
maintenance in a bid to ensure the quality of the concrete for the
Three Gorges Dam, especially its durability.
</P>
<P>
"With the most advanced mixing and pouring equipment, coupled
with sound quality control and management efforts, the Three
Gorges Project will become another miracle of human civilization,
just like the Great Wall and the pyramids of Egypt," Yang added.

<HEADLINE> Arbi's Decision to Quit Indonesian Squad Deplored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports
Council (KONI deplored the decision taken by national badminton
player Hariyanto Arbi to switch allegiance from Indonesia to
Singapore, The Jakarta Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
KONI deputy chairman Arie Sudewo said KONI would, however,
respect Arbi's decision regarding his future.
</P>
<P>
"We regret his decision. We will miss one of the country's top
players, but we can not restrain him for exercising his personal
rights. If his decision was considered, we can do nothing to stop
him.I think we still have many badminton players," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI)
should give more attention to their athletes, particularly on
their future.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Arbi had just won the Singapore Open singles
final on Sunday by defeating Indonesia's young hope Taufik Hidayat,
but his decision to quit his country for Singapore was the main
talk prior to the final.
</P>
<P>
Arbi will go to Singapore after he finishes competing in the
five-day Indonesia Open in Bali starting on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Arbi, the two-time All-England champion and 1996 Olympic
semifinalist, argued that he had limited opportunities back home,
particularly for the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
He cited his poor performances during the Sudirman Cup and
World Championship in Copenhagen, Denmark, last May.
</P>
<P>
"I felt disoriented, and I began thinking of what I wanted to
pursue in the near future. My performances had dropped. The world
badminton players nowadays are very good," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arbi, who is ranked number 30 in the world, repeatedly said
that his success in the Singapore Open was merely "incidental".
</P>
<P>
"PBSI said that all the players groomed in the training center
had equal chances for the Olympics, but in fact, only three
players who are considered qualified do. The others have to
undergo a selection. I try to follow this rule, but deep down in
my heart, I can't accept it," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital has vowed to
open up more sectors to overseas investment and adopt more
diversified means to utilize such investment.
</P>
<P>
A leading foreign trade official in Beijing said the city has
many advantages for overseas investors. A number of Sino-overseas
shopping malls are now open, and Sino-overseas trade companies and
travel agencies are also being planned in the city.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to open sectors such as banking, insurance,
commerce, transportation, telecommunications, foreign trade and
tourism to overseas investment in order to qualify for entry into
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
The official added that Beijing aims to achieve significant
breakthroughs in introducing overseas investment into the city's
infrastructure, renovation of old buildings, the Zhongguancun
Technological Zone, and other important industrial projects.
</P>
<P>
In addition to attracting direct overseas investment, Beijing
is also seeking to list successful enterprises on domestic and
overseas stock markets and encourage overseas investors to merge
or acquire enterprises in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
To lure more overseas investment, Beijing will sponsor two
symposiums during the second half of this year on economic
cooperation between Beijing and Hong Kong, and between Beijing and
Taiwan. Along with participating in trade talks and organizing
promotion groups overseas, the city also plans to create an
Internet website to better publicize municipal information.
</P>
<P>
Beijing approved another 309 overseas-funded enterprises during
the first half this year, attracting 986 million US dollars in
overseas investment. This year, the city used 1.37 billion US
dollars in overseas investment during the first half, an increase
of 3.7 percent over the same six-month period last year.

<HEADLINE> Jiang's Visit to Be a Historical Landmark: Thai PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming visit by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin to Thailand will be a historical landmark
for bilateral relations, Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said in
an interview with Xinhua pending Jiang's visit early next month.
</P>
<P>
"I congratulate China on its successful and fast development
during the past 50 years, which is more rapid than most other
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chuan appreciated the efforts China has made in alleviating the
impact of the Asian financial crisis, saying that China has been
able to play the role as an economic leader in the region by
promoting the stability of regional economic situation.
</P>
<P>
He said he was especially delighted by China's maintaining her
promise of not devaluating the currency, Renminbi.
</P>
<P>
Because of China's consistent efforts to promote world peace
and development, the country is now internationally accepted as an
important member of the world community, Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
As for bilateral trade and economic cooperation, Chuan was
proud to say that Thai businessmen were pioneers in entering China.
"They have met with great success in China," he added.
</P>
<P>
Despite the serious impact of the financial crisis, the trade
between Thailand and China increased to 3.56 billion U.S. dollars
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Up to date, Thailand has invested in more than 2,000 projects
in China, and China has 200 in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The economies of Thailand and China are complementary and both
countries have learned to depend on each other by buying products
from each other, he said.
</P>
<P>
Such cooperation of mutual dependence will not only benefit the
two countries, but also help alleviate the impact of the financial
crisis, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Thai side is now trying to lure more Chinese investment to
Thailand now because "China has great potentials in various areas
and there have been potentials for cooperation between us," Chuan
said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he had instructed the Ministries of
Agriculture and Commerce to find practical means to facilitate a
pulp and paper project, which the Chinese side has expressed great
interest.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that both sides will continue to increase
their investment," Chuan said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholar Finds Ancient Book Road Leading to Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Along with the famous Silk Road
connecting the East with the West, there apparently was also a
Book Road between China and Japan in ancient times, a Chinese
scholar announced here recently.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Wang Yong, director of the Research Institute of Japanese
Culture at Zhejiang University, said the Book Road played a major
role in spreading Chinese culture to Japan and other neighboring
countries during the Tang Dynasty (618 - 907 A.D.).
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, who has been to Japan many times to research
the subject, the Book Road consisted of two routes, with one
extending from Chang'an (the present-day Xi'an), then the capital
of China, to Japan through the Korean Peninsula, and the other
running from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, China's
longest river, directly to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Those engaged in the exchange of books were mainly diplomatic
envoys, monks, and merchants, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Chinese books were carried by sea to Japan
during this period, according to Wang, and a Japanese monk named
Ruxuan alone took more than 5,000 volumes of Chinese classics back
to Japan after studying in China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese-language books were also brought to China from other
Asian countries through these channels, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the silk taken to the West over the Silk Road, many of
the books exchanged via the Book Road still exist, and are playing
a role in promoting cultural progress, Wang added.

<HEADLINE> China's Dong Ethnic Group Shows Zeal for Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Despite being a poverty stricken
county where agricultural workers only have a per capita annual
income of 1,200 yuan (about 144 US dollars), the Dong minority
people of Tianzhu are keen to stress the importance of education.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the county's annual fiscal income has been
allocated for building and repairing schools in recent years,
according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
"All dilapidated houses in middle and primary schools in
Tianzhu have been repaired and upgraded," said Yao Xueyin, an
official in charge of the region's news publicity, who added that
the number of schools has risen from 116 in 1949, when new China
was founded, to the current 347, and the number of students from
about 15,000 to more than 70,000.
</P>
<P>
According to Yao, few Dong people were good at basic skills
several decades ago, but since 1949 more than 16,700 college
graduates and young people with special expertise have grown up in
Tianzhu, where more than 1.1 million Dong people now reside,
accounting for nearly 40 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, the chances to receive a college education
are still very poor for Chinese young people, especially in
minority areas, but frequently in Tianzhu, in southwest China's
Guizhou Province, one family boasts several college graduates in
its ranks. And the small village of Zhangzhai in the town of
Gaoniang reports that it has more than 100 college graduates.
</P>
<P>
"Government officials in Taizhu share a common understanding
that an ethnic group such as the Dong can only have hope for the
future by putting the emphasis on the development of education,"
Yao said.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the county have sold the two limousines awarded
by the provincial government for their outstanding achievements in
alleviating poverty: using the money to build a primary school.
They now take buses for business trips.
</P>
<P>
Another example of the dedication is provided by Yang Kaibo
whose parents even left their home town to find higher paid work
in a bid to earn more money to pay for his college tuition.
</P>
<P>
Yang enrolled in Xi'an Electronic Industry University last year
and his family have also sold all their household appliances to
pay for his studies.

BONN -- Berlin supports Poland to get the European Union (EU)
membership "as quickly as possible", said German Foreign Minister
Joschka Fischer Monday at the annual meeting with his Polish and
French counterpart, Bronislaw Geremek and Hubert Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
"Ten years after the end of Cold War there is the question,
when the EU can also overstep the former border between the two
blocks," Fischer said. "In my personal view, Poland is already a
EU member," he added, underlining the fact that Poland had been
accepted as a NATO member and its economy had been closely
integrated with Germany and the EU. (Germany-Poland-EU)

<HEADLINE> Over One Million Londoners Rush to Carnival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The streets of west London were
transformed into rivers of color on Monday as over one million
people rushed to Notting Hill for Europe's largest carnival.
</P>
<P>
Some 70 costumed bands and floats made their way through the
three-mile route which has been turned into part of the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
Bone-shaking bass lines pumping from dozens of sound systems
were pitched against shrills from thousands of whistles during
this multi-cultural festival.
</P>
<P>
Some 7,000 officers were on duty, but police said they had seen
little trouble, with only two arrests by late afternoon, one for
drunkenness and the other for a drugs offense.
</P>
<P>
A record 400,000 people turned out for children's carnival on
Sunday, also with relatively few problems.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the carnival's organizers said: "It's been a
fantastic atmosphere here, the crowds have been up, it's been a
really peaceful carnival, everyone's enjoying themselves."
</P>
<P>
And a police spokesman said:"It is busy but everyone is
enjoying themselves and it is quiet."
</P>
<P>
The Notting Hill Carnival has its roots in a 1964 street
procession aimed at bringing together an Afro-Caribbean community
blighted by racism and prejudice.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Notting Hill carnival has grown steadily
and reflected the multi-cultural nature of British society, with
performers from all over the country as well as countries ranging
from Afghanistan, Bulgaria and Russia to the Caribbean, South
America and Africa.

<HEADLINE> Desert Tamed Along China Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, August 31 (Xinhua) -- After an ongoing 40-year long
struggle between nature and a railway line crossing the fearsome
Tengger Desert in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, the sand has
finally been tamed by Chinese engineers and part of the route
transformed into an oasis acclaimed internationally.
</P>
<P>
The Tengger Desert is the fourth largest in China and when the
Baotou-Lanzhou Railway line first opened to traffic in 1958, the
Shapotou section was battered by sandstorms, which formed rolling
sand dunes overwhelming villages and fields and often preventing
the train's passage, making the area a transport bottleneck and
affecting safety on the route.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Kezhi, head of an afforestation unit in Zhongwei County
in Ningxia, explained that the railway is now protected by an
integrated sand control system formed by a 55-km long and 700-
meter wide green corridor along which 55 million shrubs and trees
have been planted, creating a shelterbelt against the desert
storms covering some 160,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
And he added that an area of 550,000 hectares of sand is
further contained by special mesh netting, made of woven straw and
grass in one meter squares, developed jointly by the Lanzhou
Desert Institute under the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the
Lanzhou Railway Bureau.
</P>
<P>
A vital water diversion project was also introduced bringing
much needed water from the Yellow River to irrigate the new desert
plants.
</P>
<P>
Zhang recalled that in the old days when the train passed
through the desert section, all the windows had to be closed and
passengers were even forced to cover their heads with scarves to
escape the sand. Train breakdowns were common occurrences.
</P>
<P>
Safety became a priority and was the main purpose in the fight
to control the desert over the last four decades, according to
Zhang. "So we launched a major campaign and introduced drastic
measures to tackle the problem," he said. "And after 41 years we
are proud to state that we have won the battle."
</P>
<P>
Today, confirms Liu Xinmin, director of the Lanzhou Institute
of Desert, the sand control project along the Baotou-Lanzhou
Railway line has succeeded in effectively beating back the desert
and as a result the ecological environment has been greatly
improved. He estimated that 450 varieties of plants have been
successfully planted in the Shapotou area compared to a mere 25
which existed before.
</P>
<P>
"And more than 140 species of wild animals, which seldom
appeared there, can now be spotted in the area along the railway
route." he added.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, hundreds of foreign experts from more than 50
countries have visited Shapotou, which now enjoys a fine
reputation as China's first nature reserve based on desert ecology.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, it was awarded the prestigious title of "Globe 500" by
the United Nations Environment Program for having effectively kept
the desert under control.

<P>
BEIRUT, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Two Lebanese weightlifters
competing in the Pan Arab Games in Amman have tested positive for
drugs, Lebanon's Daily Star reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Youssef Zein and Mahmoud Shuqair were among six who were found
to have used drugs, according to officials.
</P>
<P>
They were stripped of their silver and bronze respectively in
the over -90 kilogram category.

<P>
The other weightlifters who tested positive were Assad Jaafar
of Iraq, Ahmed Abdel Salam of Egypt, Bilal Abu Raguh of Jordan and
Zahi Ammar of Algeria. They face a ban from the sport.
</P>
<P>
Drugs first made appearance in the Games two years ago in
Lebanon when five Egyptians, two Saudis, and one each from Syria,
Kuwait, Tunisia and Algeria tested positive.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Protestant Militia to Hand in More Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's pro-British
Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) said on Monday that it would soon
give in more arms to authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Protestant LVF, the only Northern Ireland guerrilla group
to have handed in weapons from the province's conflict, also
called on its main Roman Catholic rival, the Irish Republican Army
(IRA), to follow suit and give up arms.
</P>
<P>
The LVF said in a statement its "ruling army council" had
"decided to go ahead with the second phase of our arms
decommissioning (which) commenced on December 18, 1998".
</P>
<P>
On that date, about 10 guns as well as a batch of ammunition,
grenades and other materials were given to the province's
independent disarmament commission.
</P>
<P>
"We demand that the IRA and its fellow travellers immediately
commence a reciprocative act of decommissioning," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The LVF opposed last year's landmark Good Friday peace deal
which was signed by the IRA's political ally Sinn Fein and the
political allies of pro-British guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
But after referendums in Northern Ireland and the Irish
Republic overwhelmingly approved the Good Friday deal, the LVF
announced it was calling off hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Its handover of weapons last year was hailed by Britain as a
significant step.
</P>
<P>
Other pro-British guerrilla groups and the IRA have steadfastly
refused to bow to entreaties by Britain and the Irish Republic to
disarm -- a move which London and Dublin say would revive the
stalled Good Friday accord.
