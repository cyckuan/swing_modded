REPUBLICAN PRIMARY SOFT MONEY FUND-RAISERS ORCHESTRATING HARD MONEY
FOR LAZIO 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   GREECE, N.Y. _ When Sen. John McCain lost the New York
Republican presidential primary last spring, he placed a large part
of the blame on what he asserted was an illegal $2.5 million
advertising campaign that attacked his environmental record
financed by two wealthy Texas brothers with close ties to Gov.
George W. Bush, McCain's opponent.
</P>
<P>
   One of those two brothers, Charles Wyly, resurfaced on the New
York political scene Tuesday. This time, he was allied with Rep.
Rick Lazio, who McCain has energetically promoted in television
advertisements and appearances in the congressman's Senate race
against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Lazio acknowledged in this Rochester suburb that
Wyly is a sponsor of one of three out-of-state fund-raisers Lazio
is attending on Wednesday, this one in Dallas. Wyly is one of nine
signatories to a letter asking Texans to attend the fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people believe that Mrs. Clinton is the driving force
behind some of the most radical ideas put forth by the Clinton
administration,'' the letter said. It went on to solicit
contributions of $2,000 for individuals and $4,000 for couples.
</P>
<P>
   Wyly and his brother Sam are longtime associates of Bush. Using
a loophole in federal election laws, they financed television
advertisements in several states that attacked McCain's
environmental record. The advertisements were placed by an
independent committee, ``Republicans for Clean Air,'' and were
widely criticized as inaccurately portraying the environmental
records of Bush and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   McCain filed a complaint about the advertisements with the
Federal Election Commission. McCain, as a candidate for president _
and while campaigning with Lazio _ has championed curbing what he
describes as campaign finance abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Through a spokesman, the McCain said he had no comment on Wyly's
role in Lazio's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the fund-raiser, Karen Dunn, a spokeswoman for
Clinton, urged Lazio to cancel it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick Lazio wins hypocrite of the year award, soft money
division,'' Dunn said. ``In New York, he's running an ad promoting
campaign finance reform. But in Texas, behind closed doors, he's
raising money from one of the worst abusers of campaign finance
laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, here to promote his tax cut plan, noted the money being
collected was not soft money because it will be raised to finance
an individual campaign, and as such is regulated by the Federal
Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has attacked Clinton for raising soft money, largely
unregulated campaign funds raised by political committees, to
promote her candidacy indirectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can tell you about that is that this is all clean, hard
donors,'' he said before flying to Mobile, Ala., for the first of
the fund-raisers. ``These are all disclosed dollars. These are
dollars that are protected under campaign finance reform.''

ADS BY ACTIVISTS ATTACK ANTI-MISSILE PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, New Jersey _ President Clinton may have deferred the
question of whether to build a national missile defense system to
his successor, but opponents of such a system are not satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   In television advertisements that were scheduled to begin
running on Wednesday, the nation's largest pro-disarmament group is
attacking candidates in 13 competitive House and Senate races who
favor a missile shield.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day advertising campaign is the centerpiece of efforts
by the group, Peace Action, formerly known as SANE/Freeze, to
recover a measure of the political influence it held during the
arms race of the early 1980s but quickly lost with the end of the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements are being paid for by the Peace Voter Fund,
an entity organized by Peace Action under Section 527 of the
Internal Revenue Code so it could raise money without having to
disclose its contributors. It was set up last year with $250,000 in
seed money from a handful of wealthy benefactors whom officials of
the group refuse to name.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, the advertisements will target two congressional
districts, including the 12th, where the freshman incumbent, Rep.
Rush Holt, a Democrat, is trying to fend off a challenge by the
Republican, Richard Zimmer, who held the seat from 1991 until 1996.
Zimmer favors missile-defense programs, while Holt, a physicist, is
a member of Peace Action's New Jersey affiliate and opposes the
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Peace Action advertisement is also aimed at Rep. Robert
Franks of New Jersey's 7th District, who voted this year to deploy
a missile defense as soon as it was technically feasible. Franks is
giving up his seat to run for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Another version of the advertisement, which names Rep. Rick
Lazio, the Republican candidate for Senate in New York, will run on
cable stations in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Nassau and Suffolk counties,
Albany and Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials, which will run on CNN during prime time through
Saturday, zero in on what critics say is a crucial shortcoming in
anti-missile technology. They show a balloon with a smiling face
floating skyward as a female announcer intones, ``This is a Mylar
balloon. It is not a nuclear warhead. Trouble is, the Star Wars
missile system the Pentagon is pushing can't tell the difference.
In fact, top scientists say the Star Wars technology is fatally
flawed and easily fooled. Fifty Nobel Prize winners warn it will
start a new arms race. And it's already cost us more than $60
billion.''
</P>
<P>
   As errant missiles shoot past the balloon in space, the
announcer urges viewers to call the specific candidate targeted and
tell him or her ``to come down to Earth, to stop wasting our money
on Star Wars and invest that money instead in our children's
schools and our parents' health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Gaffney Jr., a leading proponent of a national missile
defense who heads the Center for Security Policy in Washington,
called the advertisements misleading, but said he welcomed
``anything that can be done to help bring the issue of America's
vulnerability to missile attack to the attention of the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gosse, an official with Peace Action, said the group had
nearly 200,000 paid members at its peak in the late 1980s. With
about 70,000 members now, it seeks to regain the level of influence
that it held in 1984, when Walter Mondale endorsed a nuclear freeze
during his presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in this to defeat or elect anybody,'' Gosse said.
``We're in this to make all of them pay attention to us, to
understand that this is a constituency that is capable of being
politically active. Can you imagine any political force being taken
seriously today if it didn't run ads?''

DEMOCRATS' AD ATTACKS BUSH'S RECORD ON CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee announced Tuesday that it
would begin running a new commercial Thursday that takes a critical
look at Gov. George W. Bush's record of providing health care for
children in Texas. The 30-second spot is to run in nine states that
Democrats and Republicans have focused on most heavily: Arkansas,
Delaware, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Washington and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Democratic Victory 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: Video footage of Bush appears and dissolves. Cut
to the faces of several young children. Then a gavel comes down and
the words ``corrective action'' are superimposed on the screen.
More shots of children are seen, followed by a final, scowling
portrait of the governor.
</P>
<P>
   SCRIPT: Announcer: ``George W. Bush has a plan for children's
health care. But why hasn't he done it in Texas? Texas ranks 49th
out of 50 in providing health coverage to kids. It's so bad a
federal judge just ruled Texas must take immediate corrective
action. The judge's findings: Bush's administration broke a promise
to improve health care for kids. The needs of abused kids are
neglected. Texas failed to inform families of health coverage
available to a million children. The Bush record. It's becoming an
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: The spot's central accusation is the citation of a
ruling by a federal court judge in Texas on Aug. 14. The judge,
William Wayne Justice, ruled the state had failed to abide by a
1996 consent decree and provide appropriate health care for more
than 1.5 million Texas children who were eligible for Medicaid.
What the spot does not mention is that the ruling was based on a
class-action suit filed on behalf of Texas children in 1993, two
years before Bush took office. The data that puts Texas 49th in the
nation comes from Texas newspaper articles in 1999 that said only
Arizona had a lower percentage of children without health
insurance. The Bush campaign calls the spot a serious distortion,
saying that last year, the governor ``supported and signed'' a bill
that provides health insurance to 423,000 Texas children.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: Much as the condition of Gov. Michael Dukakis'
Massachusetts became a focus for Dukakis' Republican opponents in
1988, the eyes of Democratic advertising people will be upon Texas
in 2000. Indeed, the commercial's closing line hints at more
commercials of the kind to come. The Democratic spot is different
in tone from the latest spot by the Republican National Committee,
which, in a marked departure for this campaign, uses humor to take
a swipe at Gore's character and play up the perception of him as a
man who exaggerates his achievements. The effort in this new spot
is to take on Bush on the issues, a form of attack that those who
study political advertising say is often effective.

40 CHINESE OUT OF OLYMPICS; 7 TIED TO DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Wednesday in lede cq.) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Forty of China's 300 Olympic athletes have
withdrawn from the Summer Games, seven of them rowers who failed
blood tests at home indicating that they were using
performance-enhancing drugs, Olympic officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Favored to become the host city for the 2008 Summer Games,
Beijing is apparently being extremely careful to avoid another
doping scandal like those that tarnished the accomplishments of its
swimmers in recent years. There has also been skepticism about the
stunning achievements of China's distance runners in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known whether the other 33 withdrawals were related
to drugs, Sydney Olympic officials stressed. Milton Cockburn, a
spokesman for the Sydney Olympic Organizing Committee, said the
withdrawals came after a request that countries pare down their
teams or find other housing because the 10,400 available beds could
not accommodate every athlete in the Olympic village.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal of the seven rowers appears to indicate that the
implementation of blood-testing procedures for the first time at
these Sydney Games is having some deterrent effect on athletes in
endurance sports who may look to cheat by illicitly trying to
increase their oxygen-carrying capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee last week approved testing
for erythropoietin, or EPO, a synthetic version of a
naturally-occurring hormone that stimulates the production of red
blood cells and is believed to be widely used in such endurance
sports as distance running, cycling, swimming and rowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are now convinced there is a test, that the IOC is
prepared to apply it and nobody wants to send athletes to the Games
that are going to get caught and disgraced,'' said Dick Pound, an
IOC vice president from Montreal who is head of the World
Anti-Doping Agency, created by the IOC in the wake of the EPO
scandal at the 1998 Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   Extensive drug use will certainly occur at the Sydney Games, IOC
officials concede, considering there will be no tests for such
performance-enhancers as human growth hormone, insulin growth
hormone and artificial blood products. Steroid use is also so
sophisticated that topical gels can be flushed from the system in a
matter of hours. However, the EPO test may deter cheaters and
encourage athletes who do not cheat that the playing field is being
made more level, Pound said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be too superlative, but this is a terrific
sign,'' Pound said in an interview Wednesday morning. ``You end up
with a double benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC is conducting 2,100 out-of-competition tests in Sydney,
including 300 tests for EPO. Unannounced, out-of-competition tests
are considered the only reliable way to catch cheaters. The EPO
test is a combination of a French urine test that can detect direct
use of the drug for 2 or 3 days and an Australian blood test that
detects indirect use.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, IOC scientists say they are concerned about whether
the tests will withstand legal scrutiny. But the test can be just
as valuable if it discourages athletes from using EPO for fear they
might be caught, Pound said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese rowers, who included Zhang Xiuyun, a gold medalist
in the women's single scull at a World Cup race in Zurich,
Switzerland, last June, were presumably subjected in China to a
hematocrit test that showed high red-blood cell counts, an indirect
measure of the use of EPO, Pound said.
</P>
<P>
   Liu Jianyong, secretary general of the Chinese rowing
federation, said the rowers had withdrawn to ``protect their
health'' _ a euphemism used in drug cases _ and to ``uphold the
fairness of the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   China has publicly stated its determination to conduct more
vigilant drug-testing procedures after being embarrassed repeatedly
in recent years. Unlike the former East Germany, which operated a
state-sponsored system of doping, China's doping appears to be
conducted largely by individual coaches, according to American
coaches and drug experts. Its female swimmers and distance runners
have been far less dominant since the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 Chinese swimmers were caught using drugs in the
last decade, including seven at the 1994 Asian Games. One swimmer,
Yuan Yuan, was caught with 13 vials of human growth hormone, a
steroid, in her luggage at the 1998 world swimming championships in
Perth, Australia and four other Chinese women tested positive. Two
months ago, another female swimmer, Wu Yanyan, the world champion
in the 200-meter individual medley, failed a drug test at the
Chinese national championships and was banned for four years.

POPULAR SCOOTERS CARRY MANY KIDS TO EMERGENCY ROOM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: Staff Writers Harrison Sheppard and Donna Huffaker
contributed to this story. 
By JASON KANDEL and BRENT HOPKINS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Fueled by a revival in foot-powered scooters,
injuries caused by the hot, new two-wheeled toys have surged
nationwide nearly 700 percent since May, according to a report
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Scooter-related injuries landed about 4,000 people _ mostly
children _ in emergency rooms in August alone, according to the
U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.
</P>
<P>
   And more than 9,400 emergency room injuries involving the
scooters have been reported so far this year, the government
watchdog agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Harlan Gibbs, an emergency room physician for Glendale
Adventist Medical Center whose son Spencer broke his wrist while
riding a scooter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Far and away, broken wrists are the most popular orthopedic
injury among little kids today,'' Gibbs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fractured wrists from a fall off a scooter can potentially be
disastrous. The fall can upset a child's growth plates, which may
affect his quality of life later on.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs said his 7-year-old son was wearing a helmet but now will
wear wrist guards. The Hidden Hills, Calif., youngster said he
broke his wrist in the process of trying to protect his face when
he fell.
</P>
<P>
   Police said scooter riders are not required to wear a helmet _
as are bicyclists under 18 _ and they are legal to ride on streets
and sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   The scooters, which sell for $80 to $120, are modern versions of
the 1950s model that all but faded into obscurity. The new ones are
aluminum, foldable, weigh less than 10 pounds and have small wheels
similar to those on in-line skates.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission report said most injuries
occurred from falls. Twenty-nine percent of the injuries were
fractures and dislocations. Most of these injuries were to arms and
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Local doctors and nurses agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen eyebrow cuts. We've seen arm lacerations, no broken
bones,'' said Valley Presbyterian Hospital nurse manager Tony
Marcelli. ``A lot of these crashes occur because the wheels are so
small that when kids go over cracks, they don't have good
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcelli's 6-year-old daughter crashed her scooter over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got one good scrape,'' Marcelli said. ``She put the
scooter in the garage. She doesn't want to see it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at Tarzana Hospital in Los Angeles recently treated a
10-year- old boy who had twisted his foot that got caught under a
scooter, said Terri Pfeiffer, a registered nurse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only seen one case,'' Pfeiffer said, ``I'm sure they'll
be more.''
</P>
<P>
   Injuries or not, parents are having difficulty resisting their
children asking, ``When can I get one?''
</P>
<P>
   ``My 5-year-old son is driving me crazy about them,'' said
Monica Shaw, 32, while waiting to pick up her daughter at Francis
Parkman Middle School in the upscale L.A. suburb of Woodland Hills.
``He keeps asking, `I'll get one for Christmas, right Mom?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Local schools are aware of the latest craze, and some officials
say the rules for scooters are the same for skateboards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids are buying them left and right, but it hasn't caused
a problem yet,'' said Carlos Martinez, assistant principal at North
Hollywood High School. ``Right now, they're not a nuisance, but
we're keeping an eye on them.''
</P>
<P>
   At North Hollywood, students are free to bring the scooters, as
long as they keep them folded and stored during school hours, just
like with skateboards and other wheeled toys.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Lioy, principal of Beachy Avenue Elementary in the
blue-collar L.A. suburb of Arleta, said that he asks students to
leave their scooters behind because of theft concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recommend that they don't bring them because they're so
hard to lock up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many schools, however, reported that the scooters have yet to
make any sort of impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't discussed it yet,'' said Jean Siegel, B-track dean
for John H. Francis Polytechnic in the Sun Valley neighborhood on
the edge of Los Angeles. ``I haven't seen to many of them around.''
</P>
<P>
   At schools in Glendale, Calif., on Thursday, the first day,
scooters will be parked in the principal's office or stowed in a
backpack but they're not to be ridden on the campus, said Vic
Pallos, spokesman for Glendale Unified Schools.

PAIR OF BOOKS CAN HELP MAKE DUMMIES WISE  &HT;     BY PETER SINTON

<P>
   The Books for Dummies gang at IDG Books Worldwide in Foster City
keeps rolling out new titles for entrepreneurs who want instant
insights.
</P>
<P>
   Two on this summer's reading list are ``Franchising for
Dummies'' by Wendy's chief executive and chief pitchman Dave Thomas
and franchise consultant Michael Seid, and ``Marketing Kit for
Dummies'' by Alexander Hiam, a consulting and training-firm CEO
with an MBA from the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Both books are filled with checklists, cheat sheets and useful
lists of do's and don'ts for business beginners.
</P>
<P>
   One might wonder if it's wise to listen to the founder of
Wendy's, whose stock has lost about 35 percent of its value during
the past year. But Thomas' 5 percent share is still worth about
$105 million, and the guy does &UR;  &LR; know how to flip ideas as well as

   ``The misconception is that owning a franchise is easy, that
it's a victory every time,'' says Seid. ``The survival rate is
better than independent businesses, but in some franchises, the
death rate can be 15 percent a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few of his and Thomas' tips:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Avoid franchise brokers.  &LR; They are typically paid by
franchisors to find franchisees and close the deal. Seid has
reservations about that and also questions franchise brokers'
``psychological testing'' techniques and the merits of using a
third party to find someone you intend to spend the next 10 or 20
years of your life with.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; If you are the first franchisee of a new chain, negotiate a &LR; 
 &UR; walk-away clause in your franchise agreement.  &LR; This will be
beneficial if the franchisor can't grow the franchise system.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Check out Small Business Administration loans.  &LR; The SBA
provides about 12,000 loans to franchisees in nearly 1,200
franchise systems. Check out &LR;  www.franchiseregistry.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Consider ``emerging markets.''  &LR; Many downtown areas are still
underdeveloped for branded quality goods and services. &UR;  &LR; They may
also qualify for tax credits on equipment and employee salaries.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Senior citizens are the fastest-growing segment of the &LR; 
 &UR; population.  &LR; With the recent easing of rules affecting the Social
Security earnings cap, this pool of potential workers is ripe for
hiring.
</P>
<P>
   Seid also advises prospective franchisees to check whether the
franchisor is well positioned against the competition, including
non-franchisors.
</P>
<P>
   Does the product or service have legs? He notes that ``auto
aftermarket'' franchises looked good in the 1980s, but that changed
after &UR;  &LR; new cars no longer required a tuneup every 15,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Also, find out whether the franchisor is spending money on
research and development, new products, service and field staff.
Beware if most of the resources are going to add franchises or
expand geographically.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Franchising for Dummies,'' ``Marketing Kit for Dummies''
quickly covers a lot of terrain, such as preparing a newsletter,
using testimonials, planning ad and publicity campaigns, and tips
on closing a sale.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the book reads like a lecture, but color often
accompanies the advice. For example:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Remember what your customers like.  &LR; Ritz-Carlton hotels keep
records on customer preferences and might serve a complimentary
glass of Kendall-Jackson Chardonnay to a guest who ordered a bottle
on a previous visit.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Reward large customers.  &LR; Toys R Us gave away free Tickle Me
Elmo dolls to customers who purchased more than $100 worth of
Christmas gifts. (Hiam suggests offering an incentive to customers
who buy more than 1.5 times the business' average sale amount.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Make it easy for customers to reach you.  &LR; At Motorola, key
customers receive pager numbers for executives.
</P>
<P>
   Author Hiam, who is based in Massachusetts but is setting up a
consulting and employee training branch office in San Francisco,
also has praise for several local businesses. He mentions Sidney's
hair salon in San Francisco for ``high-end service,'' saying it
shuns walk-in traffic but keeps detailed records for regular
customers and often provides food for evening clients.
</P>
<P>
   Hiam also commends CalFed for its 50+ Interest Checking account,
which offers anyone older than 50 unlimited check writing with no
monthly service charges and pays interest (albeit a modest 0.5
percent, currently).
</P>
<P>
   ``The bulk of the wealth in this country is held by people in
this category,'' Hiam notes. ``No doubt CalFed has attracted some
large and very stable accounts.''

NEW MATERIALS PROMISE BIG BOOST IN DATA STORAGE  &HT;     BY HENRY NORR
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ New materials described in a scientific journal
this week could help boost the data-storage capacity of PC hard
disks as much as seventy-fivefold in three to five years, making it
possible to store whole libraries of digital movies and music on a
single drive.
<P>
   With other expected advances in storage technology, the new
materials could increase the capacity of the magnetic platters
spinning inside a hard drive to 1,000 gigabits, or 1 terabit, of
information per square inch. Today's top PC drives store about 14
gigabits per square inch.
</P>
<P>
   In a report in the current issue of the journal Science,
scientists at the NEC Research Institute in Princeton, N.J.,
described new composites that exhibit a property they call
``extraordinary magnetoresistance,'' or EMR. Current drive
technology is based on a phenomenon called ``giant
magnetoresistance,'' or GMR; other scientists have recently
developed materials exhibiting ``colossal magnetoresistance,'' or
CMR.
</P>
<P>
   The magnetoresistance of a material refers to the percentage
change of its electrical resistance in the presence of a magnetic
field. The higher the magnetoresistance of a material, the smaller
the magnetic field it can distinguish.
</P>
<P>
   When materials with higher levels of magnetoresistance are
incorporated into future drives' ``read heads'' _ the components
that float just above the spinning platters and react to magnetic
polarities on their surface _ they can determine the magnetic state
of smaller areas, thus making possible huge increases in the
data-storage capacity of a given surface area.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of NEC06 (82840 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The resistance of most materials changes only very slightly when
they are exposed to a magnetic field _ even the latest GMR
materials change by no more than 20 percent at room temperatures.
CMR materials show much greater sensitivity, but only at very low
temperatures that aren't practical in hard drives, according to
Stuart Solin, head of the NEC Research team.
</P>
<P>
   The resistance of EMR materials at room temperature, however,
varies by 100 to 1 million percent, depending on the strength of
the magnetic field, according to the NEC report.
</P>
<P>
   Heads incorporating EMR materials would be not only more
sensitive, but also far easier to manufacture and therefore cheaper
than current equivalents, according to Solin. But he acknowledged
that the technology's adoption in the data-storage industry is not
a sure thing. ``No matter how good our solution is,'' he said, ``it
won't be adopted unless conventional technologies hit the wall, or
at least get close to it.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``just about everyone'' believes current
technologies will reach their technical limits well below a density
of 1,000 gigabits per square inch _ probably at or below 200
gigabits per square inch. To take full advantage of the potential
of EMR, he said, the industry will also need to develop new
materials for the disks that store the data inside a drive, but he
said advances in this area are expected.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of NEC06 (82840 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Jim Porter, president of Disk/Trend, a Mountain View
market-research company that focuses on the storage industry,
agreed that the outlook for densities beyond 100 gigabits per
square inch has been uncertain. But, he noted, ``scientists have
been discussing the effective limit on areal density for years, and
all the past forecasts have been eclipsed.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to the NEC technology's prospects in data storage, he
said, is whether it is adopted by the companies that have led the
way in boosting hard-disk density _ IBM, Seagate, Hitachi and
Fujitsu.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens in the storage arena, Solin said, his group's
discovery is certain to find a market. It has applications in the
booming cell phone business and in automobile engines and brakes.
In fact, he said, one company has already licensed the technology
from NEC for use in the automotive field.

INVESTMENT BANK AIMS TO TAKES ITSELF PUBLIC  &HT;     BY SAM ZUCKERMAN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ The investment bank Robertson Stephens has taken
hundreds of companies public during the last few years. Now, the
San Francisco firm may come to market with its own initial public
offering.
<P>
   Fleet Boston Financial Corp., the giant New England bank that
owns Robertson Stephens, is weighing a spin-off of a minority stake
in the firm to the public, sources familiar with the matter said.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of discussions during the past six months,
executives of Robertson Stephens and Fleet Boston have agreed on
the merits of a transaction, but haven't begun the tough bargaining
on terms, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   That means a public offering of Robertson Stephens would not
happen for six months or more. And it's also possible Fleet and
Robertson won't be able to agree on terms, preventing an IPO from
taking place, one source said. A Robertson Stephens spokeswoman
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   A sale of a stake in Robertson Stephens to the public would
allow Fleet to capitalize on the high values investment banks are
commanding without giving up control.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an ideal time to do a public offering,'' said Gary
Craft, a San Francisco e-commerce analyst for the investment bank
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. ``There are so few independent,
technology-driven investment banks left.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, for Roberston Stephens, an IPO would let it award
stock and options to employees, a powerful weapon in the cutthroat
competition for star investment bankers and stock analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1969, Robertson Stephens specializes in taking
high-tech and health care-services companies public. The firm is
the nation's No. 12 investment bank as measured by the dollars it
has raised for clients in public stock offerings this year.
</P>
<P>
   If Robertson Stephens were to sell shares to the public, the
firm would probably be valued at several billion dollars, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's predecessor bought the firm for $800 million two years
ago. Since then, Robertson Stephens' revenue has quadrupled to
about $2 billion annually as the firm has ridden the wave of the
public's insatiable demand for technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Around the world, a series of takeovers at hefty prices is
shaking up the investment banking industry. Last month, in one of
the biggest recent deals, Credit Suisse First Boston agreed to buy
rival Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette for more than $13 billion,
creating one of the industry's dominant firms.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay Area, a Robertson Stephens IPO would mark the latest
twist in what has been a tumultuous investment banking scene during
the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Just about all San Francisco's big, home-grown investment banks
_ Montgomery Securities and Hambrecht &AMP; Quist as well as Robertson
Stephens _ were bought out by big commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a flock of startups, many rooted in Internet
technology, have opened shop. And the largest U.S. investment
banks, including Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse First Boston, have
all beefed up their operations in the area to take advantage of the
IPO and merger boom.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that could hold up a Robertson Stephens public
offering is the difficulty of reaching an agreement with Fleet on
how large a stake to spin off to the public, sources familiar with
the matter noted. Fleet wants to keep as large a position as it
can, while officials of the investment bank want to sell as much
stock as possible, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Such differences are typical in spin-offs, industry watchers
noted. For Fleet, `retaining more shares would have a greater
impact'' on the value of the bank's own stock, said Scott Schubert,
an investment banker with the firm Putnam Lovell Securities.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the public markets prefer to see more liquidity than
less,'' Schubert said. ``It would attach a better valuation if
Fleet were to sell more.''

GOODWIN HAS FUTURE IN L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The rap on Tom Goodwin's offense is he strikes out
too much for a leadoff hitter. However, the rest of his offense is
fine and, coupled with his defense, enough for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   When Goodwin was acquired in a non-waiver-trading-deadline deal
with Colorado, there were questions about whether the Los Angeles
Dodgers were committed to him long-term. He has two years remaining
on his contract and it appears those years will be with the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said he's excited about
Goodwin's future. Malone was asked if that future was with the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it is,'' Malone said. ``I've studied it. I've done the
research. Guys like him don't exist, a leadoff-center fielder. I've
seen enough to know he can be. We'd like him to improve in center
areas, but everyone can improve. I think he has the potential to be
exactly what we need.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin extended his hitting streak to a season-high seven games
with a first-inning single Tuesday against Pittsburgh. He entered
batting .255 since joining the Dodgers on Aug. 1. His on-base
percentage was .339 and he scored 15 runs.
</P>
<P>
   But Goodwin, who scored 65 runs in 91 games with Colorado, has a
propensity to strike out. He had 28 hits in 32 games with the
Dodgers but also 28 strikeouts. In 505 plate appearances this
season, Goodwin has walked 64 times and struck out 104 times. He
has 45 stolen bases but only six with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key with this guy is he's a run-scorer,'' Malone said.
``He's going to work on a higher on-base percentage and he needs to
cut down on his strikeouts, but the guy is an exciting player. He
brings a dimension to this club that we definitely need.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Dodgers have plans for Goodwin, their offseason
approach to Devon White is different. White is guaranteed another
$5.9 million. The Dodgers will try to trade him in the offseason,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hundley heads home: Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley was in the
starting lineup but with a heavy heart. His mother, Betty Oneada
Hundley, died Monday night in Chicago after a long bout with
cancer. She was 58.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley will fly to Chicago today and rejoin the team Saturday
in Colorado, though the club wasn't sure if he would make it to
Denver in time for the 12:05 p.m. game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd feels blessed that she was no longer suffering and feels
she's in a much better place now, but he loved his mom a lot, as I
think everyone knows,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said.
``He's hurting right now. I think it's been bothering him since we
went to Chicago (in late August). . . . I told him to take as much
time as he needs. If he wants to come back in Arizona on Monday,
that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   During off days in the past two months, Hundley would often fly
to Chicago to be with his mother and father, Randy Hundley. ``It's
been a rough night for him, not much sleep,'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: The Dodgers activated shortstop Kevin Elster
from the 15-day disabled list, but Johnson said Elster wasn't 100
percent. . . . Former Brooklyn Dodgers player, manager and scout
Clyde Sukeforth died Sunday at the age of 98 at his Waldoboro,
Maine. He was the oldest living former Dodgers player. Sukeforth
caught for the Dodgers from 1932-34 and again in 1945. He managed
the Dodgers on an interim basis in 1947 and scouted from 1936-51.
He is credited with signing Don Newcombe, Roy Campanella and
Roberto Clemente and was dispatched by Branch Rickey to scout
Jackie Robinson.

BOOMING ECONOMY DRIVES UP DEMAND FOR MURALS  &HT;     BY PETER SINTON
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ The Bay Area is more than a leader in computer
chips, the Internet and multimedia. It's also a major center for
mural artists.
<P>
   From San Jose to Sebastopol, San Francisco to Pleasanton, 47
mural businesses are listed in local phone books compared with 43
around New York City and 37 each in the Los Angeles and Chicago
metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has been a mecca for muralists since the Public
Works Administration commissioned Diego Rivera, Gottardo Piazzoni
and other artists during the 1930s Depression to paint social
scenes and pastoral panels in public buildings, including Coit
Tower and the old San Francisco Library.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there is a renaissance of mural painting thanks to the
booming economy and the desire of wealthy individuals and companies
to dress up their homes and places of business to make a statement
and attract attention.
</P>
<P>
   Il Fornaio America Corp. installed Italian-style murals designed
and painted by San Francisco's Evans &AMP; Brown in its first
restaurant at Levi's Plaza 12 years ago. It was a big success, and
Il Fornaio has placed at least $25,000 worth of faux frescoes in
each of its 23 restaurants around California and the country.
</P>
<P>
   Il Fornaio Chairman Larry Mindel said the murals are important
to him and his patrons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The art makes people feel as though they are in Italy,'' he
said. ``The trick of Evans &AMP; Brown murals is that they capture that
Old World feeling and look like the real deal without being
contrived.''
</P>
<P>
   Creating an actual fresco is labor intensive and generally
requires that the art be created at the final site rather than the
artist's studio.
</P>
<P>
   To mimic the antique plaster surface of a real fresco, Evans &AMP;
Brown and others have devised a technique involving coating muslin
with a thin paste of marble dust, polymer and other materials..
</P>
<P>
   Mark Evans, who previously ran a photo studio for Emporium owner
Carter Hawley Hale, teamed up with painter Charley Brown in 1984.
After visits to Europe, they were inspired to create their own
murals for commercial and residential projects.
</P>
<P>
   Although the firm specializes in Tiepolo and other Italianate
scenes, it has a broad artistic range. It recently installed two
54-by-16-foot surrealistic murals of huge floating mineral-like
spheres through space in the old Fashion Center at 650 Townsend St.
that now houses Sega and other media and Internet companies. The
project took more than two months and cost more than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Evans &AMP; Brown's work is displayed on the 36-foot diameter
ceiling of the James Hormel Gay and Lesbian room at the San
Francisco Public Library, the lobby of the Bellagio Hotel in Las
Vegas and Sony Entertainment in Culver City (Los Angeles County).
</P>
<P>
   ``We sailed through the recession (in the early '90s),'' said
Evans, whose firm is not limited to local contracts.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; International Business
</P>
<P>
   The company produced an ``Age of Exploration'' mural for the
recently expanded Disneyland near Tokyo and installed a
10-by-60-foot California Wine Country scene in the Eureka
Restaurant in Tokyo's Imperial Hotel. It produced three large 19
century-style French Academic scenes of the education of Bacchus
for the casino of Deauville, Normandy, and created Pompeian-style
frescoes for the U.S. Embassy in Cypress.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the two partners have 14 employees in San Francisco and a
business that generates close to $2 million a year in revenue.
About 70 percent of the work is commercial; the balance is for
individual residences.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Evans &AMP; Brown created a Turkish motif for Ann and
Gordon Getty in their Pacific Heights residence.
</P>
<P>
   The mural business is not all peaches and cream. Last month,
Alabama artist Garth Benton sued the Gettys for painting over
another wall mural they commissioned him to paint. Citing an
obscure 1980 California law that that holds defacing art to be
``detrimental to the artist's reputation,'' Benton sued the Gettys
for $327,000 plus damages. The Gettys subsequently have hired art
experts to restore the mural.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Made to Order
</P>
<P>
   Muralists are generally more open to what clients want them to
paint than most so-called fine artists. But they have their limits.
Evans &AMP; Brown, for instance, refuse requests to paint images of the
Golden Gate Bridge or cable cars.
</P>
<P>
   The wife-and-husband mural team of Jennifer Ewing and Leo
Germano like to paint Italian scenes like many other muralists. But
the couple, which operate as the firm Ewing Germano, were happy to
paint eight 20-foot panels depicting San Francisco football history
for former 49er Len Rohde's Burger King restaurant in Mountain
View.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's distinctive,'' said Rohde, who operates nine Burger Kings
and two Applebee restaurants in the South Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, Ewing and Germano don't like to render sporting
events, but back in 1995, Germano said, ``We didn't look down our
noses at work.''
</P>
<P>
   Although both Ewing and Germano studied art in college, they
didn't start out as muralists. They met at Woodward Clyde
Consultants, an Oakland engineering firm where both did drafting
and prepared site maps in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of it was black and white and we were starved for
color,'' Ewing recalled.
</P>
<P>
   On a five-month honeymoon to Europe in 1988, Ewing drew water
colors that she later showed to window display managers at Neiman
Marcus, Nordstrom, Gump's and other stores. Her drawings won her
some mural contracts, including a commission to create five
elaborate Renaissance palace displays for Neiman Marcus' Union
Square Christmas windows in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   While Ewing painted full time in a $600-a-month live-work space
in San Francisco's South of Market area that was once used for cold
storage, Germano kept his hand in geologic mapping until their
mural business became self-sustaining. He also took courses at the
Renaissance Entrepreneurship Center to learn about writing a
business plan, preparing spreadsheets and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned what we need to charge to survive,'' said Germano.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of most murals runs from $20 to $200 a square foot
depending on size, complexity of design, level of detail and
installation requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing and Germano typically charge about $900 a day for both of
their time. That might translate into $3,600 for a simple
4-by-12-foot landscape that takes the duo four days to complete to
$23,500 for a complex 16-foot by 80-foot mural that takes 25 days
to research and render.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing and Germano have installed a 23-by-23-foot canvas of
Rome's Spanish Steps in ItalFoods' showroom in South San Francisco,
and numerous other Italian countryside and cuisine scenes for
hotels, restaurants and wineries, including the San Francisco
Marriott Hotel and Robert Mondavi's La Famiglia Winery.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Other clients include Levi Strauss, Peet's Coffee and private
residences. For example, Ewing Germano painted a Paris street scene
for Schwab co-CEO David Pottruck.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Staying Busy
</P>
<P>
   Most mural businesses like that of Ewing and Germano are
mom-and-pop shops. But there are a few with more than a dozen
employees such as San Francisco's Mural Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Started in 1978 by Les and Brenda Cole Seymour, who were both
trained in fine arts and commercial design, the firm hires from
seven to 15 employees, depending on the workload, and grosses
between &QL; 
$1 million and $2 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Seymours have created Italianate murals for clients such as
the Limited stores and Hotel Villa Florence in San Francisco. They
also have created 20,000 square feet of jungle scene murals for the
Lost City Resort in South Africa, faux tapestries for a Tokyo Hyatt
and a 1920s Hollywood Art Deco theme for the MGM Grand in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco is a bigger mural center than most American
cities,'' said Les Seymour. ``Hotels, restaurants, office
buildings, banks and high-end residences from Hillsborough to Lake
Tahoe are buying our murals.''
</P>
<P>
   But more interest and orders are not necessarily good things.
``We're maxed out,'' said Brown of Evans &AMP; Brown. ``I don't have a
dot-commer's energy to work 100 hours a week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not interesting for us to be administrators,'' added
Evans. ``Charley needs to be a painter, and I need design work.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the partners have a plan to build revenues without
overtaxing their creativity or time. After seeing their handmade
designs getting copied commercially, Evans and Brown accepted an
offer to create an upscale line of vinyl wall coverings for the
Koroseal division of RJF International Corp. in Ohio (formerly a
unit of BFGoodrich).
</P>
<P>
   ``To keep from getting knocked off, we decided to knock
ourselves off,'' said Evans. ``We're taking a humble material
considered cheap and tacky for a long time and making it opulent
and elegant.
</P>
<P>
   Products range from large mural scenes to textured vinyl wall
coverings that look like folded linen or draped silk.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the faux fabric is commercially available, the
Fairmont Hotel has ordered the draped silk pattern for its
remodeled ballroom in San Francisco. The price per square yard
could be $16 or less depending on the quantity _ a small fraction
of the cost of the hand-painted equivalent.

HACKETT WANTS NO LETDOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Signs are everywhere that USC coach Paul Hackett
is worried this week, starting with the one attached to the door at
Howard Jones Field announcing that football practices are closed to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't think the Trojans were ranked 11th in the nation
Tuesday, as Hackett halted practice twice to chew out the team
while it prepared for 0-1 Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human nature kicks in when you win a big game and think you're
pretty good,'' Hackett said. ``No, we're not pretty good. We won
one game.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood has become reminiscent of previous years when the
Trojans played big games against Florida State, Oregon or UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned going into this game,'' Hackett said. ``They're
mad as hornets because they lost a game and we're just trying to
get into a routine. I think byes are lousy. Your routine is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   So who is to blame? After thinking about it, Hackett admitted
that last week's bye was created when he opted to play Penn State
in the Kickoff Classic. Originally, Colorado was supposed to be
USC's season-opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I shouldn't be too upset about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Circle the date: USC assistant coach Kennedy Pola has looked
forward to this week's game for some time, and for a while it was
from the other side of the matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Pola, a former USC fullback, coached at Colorado in 1997 and
'98.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've kind of had this game mapped,'' Pola said. ``I've always
waited for this moment. When I was recruiting against USC, I would
tell people 'Hey, we'll play them in two years.' At that time, I
didn't see myself on the USC sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been hard to hear the fight song and not put my
fingers up in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Pola coached many of the prime players in Colorado's offense,
including tailback Cortlen Johnson and wide receivers Javon Green
and John Minardi.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hard thing is seeing kids you coached and realizing, 'Wait
a minute, I don't coach them,' '' Pola said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Goodson ailing: Freshman defensive lineman Nate Goodson
suffered an asthma attack during practice and paramedics
administered oxygen before taking him to California Hospital in Los
Angeles. He returned to campus by early evening.
</P>
<P>
   The news is not so good for strong safety Matt Grootegoed, who
will not practice this week and is believed to have mononucleosis.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Petros Papadakis also missed practice after displaying
flu-like symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   __ Acosta quits: Center Carlos Acosta of Moorpark College has
decided to leave the team and will probably transfer to another
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears his head was not in it,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Acosta had left the team in August because he was homesick and
rejoined the Trojans when school started last week.
</P>
<P>
   __ Game captains: Hackett said fullback Charlie Landrigan and
offensive tackle Faaesea Mailo will be offensive captains, and
defensive back Kris Richard and defensive end Lonnie Ford will be
defensive captains against Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans will have different captains every game until
midseason, when they vote for permanent captains.

KIEFER AND SAFIN WIN, BUT WHO IS WATCHING?
</HEADLINE>
   (Story skedded as TEN-USOPEN is now two stories TEN-USOPEN-MEN and
TEN-USOPEN-WOMEN) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In one hermetically sealed pocket of Manhattan,
Nicolas Kiefer spent an unsettling Sunday night in a hotel where
guards were eyeing everything but the floor tiles, where security
alerts were shaking his sense of safety, and where the Palestinian
leader, Yasser Arafat, had taken up residence for the U.N.
Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
   How was Kiefer supposed to sleep?
</P>
<P>
   In a cozy corner of the National Tennis Center, Magnus Norman
spent the same steamy Sunday night inside a crammed Grandstand
stadium, where he kept shaking out his cramping legs as if they
were rumpled bed sheets, where he nearly expired in the fourth hour
of his intense third-round match, and where he finally escaped the
wingspan of Max Mirnyi to exit intact.
</P>
<P>
   How was Norman supposed to recover?
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, both players arrived for their Round of 16 match on Day
9 of the U.S. Open in varying states of decay. The 14th-seeded
Kiefer was sleep deprived, while the third-seeded Norman was
battling fatigue and a sore throat.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, there is always something standing in the way of
consistency on the men's tour. Instead of stamping himself as a
certified star in yet another Grand Slam opportunity to make a
bigger name for himself, Norman became another victim of top-seeded
extinction at the U.S. Open once a more aggressive Kiefer put him
away, 6-2, 6-7 (3), 6-1, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   In an instant, Norman joined the No. 1-seeded Andre Agassi and
the No. 2-seeded Gustavo Kuerten in his premature exit. This is the
first time since the beginning of the Open Era (1968) that the top
three seeded men have failed to outlast the fourth round. And with
the quarterfinals set to begin Wednesday, only two of the top eight
seeded men remain: fourth-seeded Pete Sampras and sixth-seeded
Marat Safin. Safin, the affable young Russian, was a 6-1, 6-2, 6-2
winner Tuesday over Juan Carlos Ferrero, but only a few spectators
were there to witness it in a nearly vacant Arthur Ashe Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was only another sign of apathy toward a men's tour
struggling to conjure up the star power that has propelled the
women's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the spectators, they have some other things to do,''
said Safin, who arrived on the court after Venus Williams exited
with a victory and took the fans with her. ``I think if they're not
here, they have to be somewhere, no?''
</P>
<P>
   They weren't around for Norman's struggle, either. He was in
trouble from the beginning of his match against Kiefer. Out of
sorts, Norman could not keep his ground strokes down in a swirling
wind and failed to put a good punch on his volleys. By the time he
trailed, 4-1, in the first set, Norman had committed 10 unforced
errors, while an under-control Kiefer had just two.
</P>
<P>
   Only a questionable line call in the second-set tiebreaker gave
Norman hope. He was down by 3-1 when an apparent ace by Kiefer was
overruled. Visibly upset, Kiefer lost a string of six straight
points to hand the tiebreaker to Norman. That was the last moment
of relief for Norman. For the rest of the match, he was unable to
control his wild swipes at his forehands, even crushing one short
ball against the back wall of the court on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   Out of answers by the middle of the fourth set, Norman even went
to his duffel bag for some psychological help. He pulled out the
same Lifesaver-red shirt he wore when he came back from two sets
down to beat the mighty Mirnyi late Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like I'm more on fire when I'm playing with that
shirt,'' said Norman, perhaps taking his cue from Tiger Woods'
tradition of wearing red on the final day of a tournament. ``Makes
me hot, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it did not work. After 59 unforced errors, Norman
became just another top man ushered out of the tournament. He had
hoped for much more. So had the marketing department of the men's
tour. Officials were looking to launch their photogenic young
phenoms (about a dozen of them, it seemed) into the American
consciousness during the U.S. Open. But only Safin and ninth-seeded
Lleyton Hewitt remain. Unseeded Arnaud Clement and Thomas
Johansson, who also won his fourth-round match Tuesday, are also in
the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   During this shakeout of the top, Sampras remains as the one
steady name at the top of an increasingly homogeneous group trying
to string together two good months in a row. At times, Sampras,
long removed from making a No. 1 ranking his top priority, has
wondered if the up-and-coming players have the attention spans to
be consistent.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, no one has stepped forward to dominate. While Norman
has occupied the No. 1 ranking at times, and won five tour titles
last year, he has yet to become a household name by winning a
major.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it will be a great help,'' Norman said. ``You know,
I'm a little tired of answering that question about my status.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Norman was weary on the court, as well. He admitted he
had enough energy even after battling Mirnyi, but the sore throat
that began creeping up on him Monday night did not help. He said he
had trouble with the wind and chill, but his mind was not as
focused as it could have been during the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today my rhythm wasn't there,'' Norman said. ``My head wasn't
really there. My body wasn't really there. But he didn't make it
easy for me either.''
</P>
<P>
   A livelier Kiefer fought through his fatigue. He was the one
with the crisper ground strokes and snappier footwork. On this
occasion, he was able to handle his ordeal a little better than
Norman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a bad night,'' said Kiefer, who switched hotels Monday
morning. ``It was only stress for me. I couldn't relax one
minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is ever easy in the men's draw. Thus far, none of the
women have complained about the various locations of their
accommodations. In fact, when Williams was told of Kiefer's
tribulations in the neighborhood of the United Nations, she sighed
and said, ``That's a bad choice.''

HINGIS CRUISES TO FACE VENUS WILLIAMS
</HEADLINE>
   (Story skedded as TEN-USOPEN is now two stories, TEN-USOPEN-MEN
and TEN-USOPEN-WOMEN) 
 By LIZ ROBBINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Martina Hingis sat in traffic for one agonizing hour
Tuesday afternoon getting to the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   But when she finally took the wheel Tuesday night, she found
herself halfway to the semifinals of the U.S. Open in an
eye-blinking 14 minutes, joy riding on a superhighway littered with
Monica Seles' unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
   Seles, a two-time U.S. Open winner, could only win a total of
six points in the first six games. In the face of a
precision-timing expert like Hingis, Seles' look was as blank as
her first-set score.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the woman who has overcome more than just a one-set deficit
recovered to give Hingis a challenge, if not better practice for
the next round.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, who won the Open in 1997, needed 48 minutes for the
second set before she forced Seles to strike a backhand wide that
gave Hingis a 6-0, 7-5 victory and her fifth straight U.S. Open
semifinal berth.
</P>
<P>
   She will entertain a rematch with third-seeded Venus Williams,
who rode a far bumpier path to their semifinal meeting, eventually
undoing No. 8 Nathalie Tauziat, 6-4, 1-6, 6-1. Williams won her
last match with Hingis, a quarterfinal at Wimbledon, en route to
her first Grand Slam title in July.
</P>
<P>
   But while Williams clunked to her 24th straight victory Tuesday,
committing 31 unforced errors, Hingis committing only 13 errors and
revealed very little vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Hingis even admitted that she was too good.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you focus that much in the first set, I was cruising
through, everything was happening so fast, I almost got scared,
like `Please slow it down, somehow,''' Hingis said.
</P>
<P>
   Seles, meanwhile, was just looking to stop time before it was
too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really started off the match sluggishly,'' she said. ``My
balls were flying all over the place. Maybe I panicked a bit.
Against Martina, you're not going to get any free points. I started
making so many unforced errors and the set was gone probably in 10,
15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought: `This is really bad. It could get worse. I could
bag it in.' But at least I kept fighting and made it a better
second set.''
</P>
<P>
   When Seles badly mis-hit an overhead shot long in the second
set, bonking it off the racquet, the crowd groaned in sympathy and
encouraged her to make another comeback. She started to attack
Hingis, breaking her at 3-1, and then, when Hingis was serving for
the match at 5-4, Seles battled to force six break points. On the
final one, Seles was successful, sounding an alarm for her
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden it was 5-all and you're like, `I've got to
take control of the match again,' which I did,'' Hingis said.
</P>
<P>
   While Seles departs the Open for the fourth straight year in the
quarterfinals, Hingis seems to arrive in the semifinals in top
form. Yet she, too, has doubts, especially since she faces a
powerful nemesis in Williams. If she gets past Williams for the
10th time in 16 meetings, as she did in last year's exhausting
three-set semifinal, will she have enough left for either Serena
Williams or Lindsay Davenport, Wednesday night's quarterfinal
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was playing well so far,'' Hingis said. ``It was
kind of a little test: Is it enough against Monica, or will it be
enough against, Venus?''
</P>
<P>
   It could be enough if Williams is as giving with her errors as
she was Tuesday in her quarterfinal. In one telling moment, leading
by 4-0 in the third set, Williams had just allowed Tauziat to break
her serve for the fifth time, following her 10th double fault with
her 29th unforced error, delivering a backhand into the net.
</P>
<P>
   But her biggest miss was yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   With an irritated harumph, Williams plunked her 6-foot-1-inch
frame into her folding chair, only the chair was not there. It was
three inches behind her. Williams sprawled onto the court, offering
a snapshot of her game Tuesday, a bit ungainly and out of sync.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really missed,'' Williams said, at least able to poke fun of
herself afterward. ``I was just angry. I just couldn't see.''
</P>
<P>
   When necessary _ no more so than in the final two games of the
third set _ Williams played well enough, flinging her limbs to
smash overheads and reach volleys, and rifled two stunning backhand
passing shots on the way to winning her 24th straight match this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   But her errors combined with her first-serve percentage of 52
did not seem to bode well for her semifinal rematch against
Hingis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think she is going to win if she plays like this,''
said Tauziat, known for being blunt since her tell-all book about
the women's tennis tour caused a small stir this summer. ``I think
if she is to win the tournament, she needs to improve her level.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Williams agreed. ``I guess I'll have to play a little bit
better,'' she said. ``I'll always play better when it comes to the
big match.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the eighth-ranked Tauziat, Williams admitted she was
less than inspired. She would roll her eyes petulantly after
struggling with her first serve, and looked supremely uninterested
during the second set. ``I wasn't competing,'' she said
</P>
<P>
   In Williams' third-round victory, a gritty Meghann Shaughnassy
was the one testing her. Tuesday, she fought herself and her own
frustration, losing her first set in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never get upset,'' Williams said. ``I was trying hard not to
stomp my feet, swing my racquet around. Some players show a lot of
emotion, but usually I don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was maybe the main battle for me, why I didn't play well.
I was too busy thinking about the points before, not focusing
ahead. I don't feel I had my best performance. In the end, the win
is on the record. I move forward.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ President Clinton is planning to hold separate
meetings with the Israeli and Palestinian leaders Wednesday, but
none of those three parties to the long-suffering
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations are optimistic that things
will advance much.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will certainly try to impress upon them, particularly on
Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, a sense of urgency. But as
they did at the close of the Camp David summit meeting in July, the
two sides remain both closer to and further than ever from a
permanent peace agreement, frozen at a decisive moment that
represents a test of their political strength and their will.
</P>
<P>
   Before them on the negotiating table still lies Jerusalem,
waiting to be carved up. Only an unexpected shift in either side's
position on the holy city's future status will allow them to
progress to another summit meeting at the close of the United
Nation's gathering of world leaders, U.S. officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Despite several Israeli and U.S. proposals for sharing
sovereignty, Arafat has remained immovable from his longtime demand
for full sovereignty over what is known in Arabic as Haram
al-Sharif _ the sacred, bitterly contested nerve center of
Jerusalem's walled Old City that Jews call the Temple Mount. And
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who met Tuesday night with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, is unwilling and too weak
politically to concede what is considered the holiest Jewish site.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Barak, in a statement issued in New York,
ruled out any breakthrough unless Arafat changes his stand on the
terms of a settlement. The statement said they ``agreed that
without an open and realistic attitude'' by Arafat ``it will not be
possible reach a breakthrough toward an agree-L ment.''
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official said after the meeting that President Clinton's
ses- sions with both Middle East leaders on Wednesday could be
critical. He said there were still differences on all the core
issues, including the fu- ture of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp David, the parties had all forecast a gloom-and-doom
scenario for September if this standoff continued. But the Israelis
and the Palestinians are not, as predicted, at the precipice of
bloody conflict. After failing to win international backing for his
stance, Arafat appears prepared to postpone the unilateral
declaration of statehood from his pledged deadline of Sept. 13.
That eliminates the prospect of an imminent collapse of the peace
effort and a spasm of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is a matter of at most a few months before another
moment of reckoning is upon the leaders. The Palestinian Central
Council will meet this weekend to debate whether the statehood
deadline should be pushed back to Nov. 15 or year's end. Clinton's
presidency is drawing to a close.
</P>
<P>
   And Barak, his government in tatters, is starting to give up on
reaching an agreement, close associates say. Publicly, he puts his
chances at 50-50. ``But I feel him shifting focus,'' said a close
associate. ``Not that he's lost interest. Obviously peace has been
his obsessive priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``But his political situation is desperate, and he has to be
realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Israeli officials say that they are having trouble
reading Arafat right now. Is he engaging in brinkmanship, or is he
genuinely unwilling to be budged from his longtime core positions?
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians, however, say that Arafat's feelings seem quite
clear. ``I think he's developing some negative attitudes toward
your American president,'' said Ghassan Khatib, a Palestinian
political analyst. ``And if he's going to give the honor of a peace
agreement, he'll give it to someone else at a later time.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's public statements, Palestinians say, represent a
genuinely unwavering stance on East Jerusalem _ ``the heart of
Palestine, the heart of Arabs, the heart of believers,'' as he told
the Arab foreign ministers in Cairo last weekend. His speech in
Cairo emphasized that he would not be rushed into a bad deal.
</P>
<P>
   Some Palestinian experts say that Arafat thinks it less risky to
protract the conflict than to seal a deal that would be perceived
as selling out not just Palestinian, but also Arab and Muslim,
rights. Many in the Arab world still believe that the Palestinians
have the right to all of the former Palestine, not only the West
Bank and Gaza Strip but what is internationally recognized as
Israel, too. Arafat, the experts say, has been putting forth the
compromise position of U.N. resolutions that call for Israeli
withdrawal from all territory occupied in the 1967 war _ which
includes all of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been fighting the extremists by the argument you have
to abide by international legality _ not more,'' Khatib said. ``How
can he tell them to live with less?''
</P>
<P>
   Experts also say that Arafat is calculating that he can
out-bluff Barak and outlive him politically. At the helm of a
minority government, Barak is holding on to office by a thread _
one legislative vote _ until parliament reconvenes at the end of
October.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are portraying Barak, who is willing to
reconfigure Jerusalem along ethnic lines, as Arafat's dream peace
partner. But the Palestinians are not as appreciative of his
concessions as the Americans and the Israelis would like them to
be, and they contend that the U.S. and Israeli positions have
become indistinguishable _ and allied against them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Having offered to guarantee unlimited access to the Western
Wall, the Palestinians do not see why the Israelis cannot concede
to them legal sovereignty over the Temple Mount, which they already
control in practical terms. They dismiss as ideologically
unacceptable and impractical the proposals on the table, which
include declaring ``divine sovereignty'' over the Temple Mount _
that is, both sides would agree that God owns the site in all its
layered history.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is reportedly under serious consideration, although
many Israelis, too, scoff at it. ``Would God then pick up the
garbage?'' an Israeli columnist asked this week. ``Whose God?''
another asked.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, some Palestinian experts say, Arafat does not
necessarily fear a right-wing Israeli government. Under the
rightist government of the former Israeli prime minister, Benjamin
Netanyahu, the Palestinians enjoyed the embrace of ever fuller
international support for their claims. Barak, on the other hand,
has courted world opinion and regained Western world backing for
Israel, successfully portraying himself as a peacemaker willing to
risk his hold on power to secure peace.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But world opinion cannot keep Barak in power, and his domestic
problems are severe _ so severe that it is unclear whether any
agreement he achieved could stand the test of time. This is
something else that the Palestinians know, robbing the moment of
its urgency for them.
</P>
<P>
   Barak remains confident that he can win the Israeli public's
backing for a far-reaching agreement that includes the
reconfiguration of Jerusalem. Getting parliament's support,
however, would be difficult _ if not impossible. So Barak would
probably call for new elections, using an agreement as a platform,
political experts say. Then, in order to get a more supportive
parliament elected, he would have to campaign not only for himself
but for a center-left coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Without an agreement, Barak is on unsteady ground. He has
indicated that he may put aside his peacemaking efforts and shift
to his domestic agenda, undertaking the so-called ``civic
revolution'' he proposed two weeks ago that would challenge many of
the powers and privileges of traditional religious parties. He
would seek to accomplish this by forging a unity government with
the rightist Likud Party and others, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But this is problematic. ``It is almost impossible to shelve the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, for starters, and then the Likud has
said that it is not interested,'' said Joseph Alpher, an expert on
Israeli diplomacy who served as Barak's adviser during Camp David.
Still, Ariel Sharon, the former general who heads the Likud, might
be tempted into a transitional alliance if he is assured that no
territorial concessions to the Palestinians would be made in the
near future, Alpher said.
</P>
<P>
   These complexities are sobering for peace advocates who believe
that Camp David was a breakthrough, engaging the Israelis and the
Palestinians in their most substantive discussions to date of the
thorniest issues.
</P>
<P>
   While some with a long lens think those discussions broke ground
that will eventually bear fruit, others say they cannot help but be
downbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even veterans of the peace process who didn't lose hope during
the Netanyahu years have been talking about the need to save the
peace process from total collapse,'' Aluf Benn wrote in the Israeli
newspaper Haaretz on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And a senior diplomat here said glumly, ``I've always tended to
be optimistic, but I'm not very at this moment.''

 DEBATE OVER DEBATES MAY CARRY FAR PAST THE ELECTION  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a fiery debate over the state of the presidential
debates this week.
</P>
<P>
   Will the candidates square off on ``Larry King Live'' or at the
University of Massachusetts? Will they do 90 minutes in prime time
before 90 million viewers or 60 minutes on a talk show with just a
fraction of that audience?
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the rhetoric, the bottom line is that some important
precedents are involved in the debate over the debates.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1988, the debates have been overseen by the nonpartisan
Presidential Commission on Debates, which was established by
agreement of the Democratic and Republican parties to make sure the
events are fair, impartial and best serve the voters.
</P>
<P>
   And it could be the voters who lose out if candidates opt
instead for a more free-for-all approach to setting up the debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Debates are for the people and belong to the people; they do
not belong to the campaign,'' said Alan Schroeder, author of
``Presidential Debates: Forty Years of High-Risk TV,'' a book
published this week by Columbia University Press. ``The commission
is as close as the citizenry has to having some kind of voice in
them ... and they ought not to be tampered with, because they do
serve the public in so many ways.''
</P>
<P>
   If Republican nominee George W. Bush succeeds in rejecting the
debate schedule proposed by the presidential commission, the Texas
governor may establish ``a dangerous historical precedent'' that
would reshape the way such events are held in the future, Schroeder
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   `'It means, in 2004, hundreds of sponsors trying to cut deals,
and the campaigns shopping among them'' for the best one, Schroeder
said. ``The interests of the citizens will not be well served.''
</P>
<P>
   It was precisely to avoid that scenario that both major parties
set up the commission, which has maintained ``an untarnished track
record of sponsorship'' of all 10 presidential and vice
presidential debates since its founding, Schroeder noted.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the commission has proposed three 90-minute
prime-time debates, in regional locations chosen for their ability
to handle the events and the media that accompany them: Oct. 3 in
Boston, Oct. 11 in Winston-Salem, N.C., and Oct. 17 in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has agreed to participate in the Oct. 17 event, but not the
other two. Instead, the Texas governor, in what Schroeder termed an
``unusual tactic,'' proposed different sponsors and his own
hand-picked alternatives. Bush proposed a Sept. 12 debate on a
prime-time broadcast of NBC's ``Meet the Press'' and an Oct. 3
matchup on CNN's ``Larry King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Competing major networks have said they will not carry those
shows _ both one hour long.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, a three-time Emmy Award winning broadcaster and
current professor at Northeastern University in Boston, said he has
no doubt what both Bush and Gore should do:
</P>
<P>
   ``Candidates, however painful it may be, should bite the bullet
and do what's best for the interest of the citizens,'' Schroeder
said. ``That means (debates) in front of the largest possible
audiences, with the fewest format constraints _ and in a length
that allows for examination of the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's camp argues that there's one reason Bush is avoiding the
full prime-time dialogue: the size of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not using the commission's recommendation literally cuts
millions of voters out of the process,'' said Peter Ragone, Gore's
California press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Ragone notes that 90 million people watched the last official
presidential debate on network television, but ``Larry King Live''
_ even during the primary debates between Bush and Arizona Sen.
John McCain _ drew just a fraction of that audience, roughly 3
million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans don't get cable television, and millions
more don't get CNN, Ragone added, and ``we've said again and again,
once Bush accepts the commission's debates, we'll participate in
many other formats.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gerry Parsky, Bush's California campaign chairman, said the
issue is Gore's own promise _ made on both ``Larry King Live'' and
``Meet the Press'' _ to debate Bush ``any time, any place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't believe Gore on what he says on this, how can you
believe him on other issues?'' Parsky asked. He said Bush wants ``a
better range of locations and formats'' that will best serve
Americans, and that the governor isn't the first to question a
schedule proposed by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton decided that the presidential debates
wouldn't be adhered to totally'' in 1996, he said. ``That's not
something Gov. Bush started.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Clinton did question the commission, but ``at no time
did Clinton ever refuse to deal with the commission as a sponsor,''
Schroeder said. With a big lead against Bob Dole, ``he tried, and
successfully did, reduce the number of debates he participated
in,'' from three to two.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also veered from the traditional format where a panel of
reporters questions candidates to agree to a ``town hall'' event
where voters ask questions, he said. That's why Bush's suggestion
that formats be expanded, Schroeder said, could indeed be valuable
for Americans trying to make a choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``What seems to work best for voters is a variety of formats,''
he said. ``Because each kind of format elicits variations from the
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Commission members have said they'll meet with Gore's camp this
week, and they have invited Bush's people to attend as well. So the
tug of war goes on, but it the bottom line remains the same: that
debates serve such an important purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``As live events, they're the only time in the campaign where
the candidates have to perform, theoretically, without a script,''
he said. ``It's a pure dialogue between people seeking office and
the voters.''

 AS SCOOTERS BECOME MORE POPULAR ACCIDENTS TO RIDERS INCREASING  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're sleek, they're swift, they're way cool. And _ what do
you know _ they're dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   In August alone, the ubiquitous silver scooters favored by kids,
teens and dot-com dweebs caused more than 4,000 visits to emergency
rooms nationwide, the Consumer Product Safety Commission in
Washington, D.C., reported Tuesday. Kids aged 15 and younger
accounted for about 90 percent of the more than 9,400 reported
incidents so far this year, according to the first major study on
scooter safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``These scooters are the in thing with kids heading back to
school,'' said Commission Chairwoman Ann Brown. ``Unfortunately,
many kids are ending up in hospital emergency rooms instead of
classrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Most reported scooter injuries were scrapes and bruises.
However, almost a third involved broken or dislocated bones, mostly
in the arms and hands.
</P>
<P>
   To date, there have been no scooter-related fatalities,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   While no specific scooter statistics have yet been compiled by
Bay Area emergency rooms, local doctors say they aren't surprised
that more and more kids are getting hurt on the contraptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are every bit as dangerous as skateboards,'' said
Dr. Carol Miller, director of the pediatric clinic at the
University of California at San Francisco Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a matter of time before they started causing
injuries,'' she said, adding that all riders should wear helmets
and pads.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 5 million scooters are expected to be sold this year
_ up from just about zero last year, when scooters were still
typically thought of as a get-around vehicle for the likes of
Dennis the Menace.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of SCOOTER0 (86159 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Today, lightweight scooters with in-line wheels, typically
selling for about $100, are the transportation of choice for the
tech-set and a must-have item for trendy youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Major retailers like Toys ``R'' Us and Kmart expect scooters to
be among their hottest sellers this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Those ringing cash registers are music to the ears of Taiwan's
J.D. Corp., maker of the popular Razor, which dominates scooter
sales. The company expects to see its revenues double to more than
$80 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Elkin, director of public affairs for the San Francisco
Unified School District, said no district-wide scooter policy
exists ``because they're so new.''
</P>
<P>
   While some schools already ban scooters on an informal basis,
she said an official, applies-to-all scooter policy should be in
place by next year, pretty much along the same lines as the
district's skateboard policy.
</P>
<P>
   Official school skateboard policy: No skateboards on campus.
Period.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Deignan, a spokesman for the San Francisco Police
Department, said helmets are required by law for scooter riders,
even though few seem to be aware of this fact.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it's illegal to ride a scooter on city sidewalks,
which, again, doesn't seem to be a fact foremost in riders' minds.
</P>
<P>
   Scooters can be ridden legally on city streets, but only if the
posted speed limit is 25 mph or less.
</P>
<P>
   Laws pertaining to push scooters are a hodgepodge of bicycle and
skateboard statutes, reflecting the still-uncertain status of the
gizmos. And not even the police seem to know exactly what they are.
</P>
<P>
   One traffic cop said his best guess about where a scooter can be
ridden legally was that ``in a business district, you can't, but in
a residential district, you can.''
</P>
<P>
   This much seems clear: If you can't ride a bike or skateboard in
a certain area _ down a crowded sidewalk, say _ chances are the
same goes for scooters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're real easy to fall on,'' said Jason Cook, 26, product
manager at the San Francisco office of HotBot, an Internet search
engine. ``All it takes is one or two misjudgements.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of SCOOTER0 (86159 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Cook, who gets to and from work on a scooter, said his worst
mishap came when he tried to jump off a curb. ``I narrowly avoided
breaking my wrist,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A little common sense, Cook insisted, will go a long way toward
keeping most scooter riders safe. Don't go for jumps, he said, and
watch out for cracks in the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Cook stressed, don't ride the things downhill.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Dayneko, 23, a Web designer at San Francisco's Guru.com, an
online employment service, said the only problem he's had with his
scooter has been running into pedestrians when taking sharp turns
at street corners.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to be careful and very aware of everyone else,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Menlo Park, Leah Shimabuku said her daughter, Camille, 7, is
not allowed to cross any streets on her scooter unless she is
accompanied by a parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not very fast,'' Shimabuku said. ``But some of those
older kids can really zip around on those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Burks said she bought her son, Kevin, a scooter for his
ninth birthday in June. So far, she said, Kevin has been using his
new set of wheels responsibly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure if they jump and do tricks, they could be
dangerous,'' Burks said. ``And they do go pretty fast. But scooters
have been around forever. We had them when we were kids.''

MIAMI-DADE MAYOR WINS BULK OF VOTES BUT MAY FACE RUNOFF
</HEADLINE>
  By RICK BRAGG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Seeking re-election as mayor of Miami-Dade County, Alex
Penelas Tuesday won the bulk of votes in an open primary contest
against nine opponents. But hours after the polls closed, it was
still unclear whether he had the 50 percent needed to win a second
term without a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   With 62 percent of the precincts reporting, Penelas had 51
percent of the vote, compared with 21 percent for Miguel Diaz de la
Portilla, a county commissioner who had been expected to offer the
strongest challenge, and 20 percent for Jay Love, a Miami
businessman. The other contenders ran far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Political experts here said that even if Penelas did not win
outright, he would handily win a second term if the race went on to
an Oct. 3 runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Penelas, who is 38 and who at one time had been mentioned as a
possible running mate for Vice President Al Gore, seemed destined
for the national political stage as late as March.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with television cameras from around the country and the
world trained on him, he said he would not allow his police
department to aid any effort by the federal authorities to remove a
6-year-old Cuban boy, Elian Gonzalez, from the home where Miami
relatives kept him in defiance of a federal order to return him to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor ``played for the moment,'' J.P. Monroe, a professor of
political science at the University of Miami, said. ``It pushed him
off the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Political experts here say Penelas had to decide between defying
the federal government and defying the wishes of a majority of
Cuban-American voters. More than 44 percent of registered voters in
Miami-Dade County are Cuban-American, according to statistics from
the county supervisor of elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It inoculated him'' against Election Day revenge by
Cuban-Americans, Monroe said.
</P>
<P>
   At the polls, Cuban-Americans said they recognized his
sacrifice, and rewarded him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps he did risk his political future on a national level,
but here he is our hero,'' said Liliana Morales, 59, a
Cuban-American who has lived in Miami since 1974. ``This just shows
you what this community means to him. He is willing to risk his
political future to stand up for his people.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might not be liked among other groups, but here the
majority is Hispanic and we think he did the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Political experts said Penelas was in some ways in an impossible
situation. If he had sided against the emotional tide that was
running through Miami, he would have lost his office and his power
base.
</P>
<P>
   As anger against the federal government washed through parts of
the county during and after the Elian standoff, many people here,
especially blacks and Anglos, said they felt pushed aside by
Penelas.
</P>
<P>
   They promised to get even at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am mainly voting against Penelas because of how he handled
the Elian debacle,'' said Jamin O'Brien, a 32-year-old filmmaker
who lives in Coconut Grove. ``That left egg on the face of the
entire community.''
</P>
<P>
   But such a backlash cannot really harm Penelas, Monroe said,
adding: ``There's not enough to worry about. It's not just the
sheer numbers, but their discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-Americans, especially older ones, are a reliable voting
bloc. Penelas courted them, strongly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has run no more than a token campaign in English,'' said
Kevin Hill, an associate professor of political science at Florida
International University.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought that whites and blacks would never forgive him,
but they tend not to vote'' when they are angry, Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   But Love, who entered the race in part because of that division
in the community, ran surprisingly well, even edging ahead of Diaz
de la Portilla as the early returns came in.

FEINSTEIN BREAKS LEG, REQUIRES SURGERY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  WASHINGTON _ Sen. Dianne Feinstein slipped on the stairs of her
Colorado vacation home and will require surgery to repair a
compound fracture of her left leg, aides said Tuesday.
<P>
   The accident occurred Friday night as Feinstein and her husband
relaxed in their Aspen house on the final weekend of the Senate's
summer recess. Aides said Feinstein sustained a compound fracture
of her left tibia, more commonly known as the shinbone.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the accident were sketchy, though aides described the
accident as painful, and said she sustained damage to her tendons.
</P>
<P>
   After returning to Washington on Monday wearing a removable
cast, the 67-year-old California Democrat met with a Capitol
physician, an orthopedic surgeon, and Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., to determine the best time for surgery.
</P>
<P>
   No decision was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some leeway in terms of when (surgery) is done,''
said Feinstein's Washington spokesman Howard Gantman. ``She's
spoken to Daschle to make sure she's here for the crucial votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides said they were not certain of the timetable for her
recovery. But they said it would not significantly affect her
ability to participate in the Senate's final push before
adjournment in early October, or her plans to campaign for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein had planned to spend most of September in Washington
and return to California for the final weeks of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shouldn't have any effect on the campaign,'' said Kam
Kuwata, who is managing her re-election. ``The best way to ask the
voters to rehire you is to do a great job as Senator. She'll be (in
Washington) and plan to make every important vote.''
</P>
<P>
   South Bay Rep. Tom Campbell, Feinstein's opponent in the Senate
race, offered his support.
</P>
<P>
   ``A compound fracture is a painful and difficult injury,'' said
Campbell spokesman Sean Walsh. ``We wish Senator Feinstein a speedy
recovery and look forward to seeing her out on the campaign trail
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate faces several key votes in the coming weeks on trade
relations with China, a patient's bill of rights and health care
spending. It may not be evident whether Feinstein's presence is
needed on the Senate floor until hours before the votes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, then-California Sen. Pete Wilson was rushed into the
Senate chambers in a wheelchair to cast a pivotal vote on a budget
package, days after undergoing an emergency appendectomy.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first broken bone Feinstein has suffered during
her political career. In 1979, as M &LR; mayor of San Francisco,
Feinstein fell and broke an elbow as she left a White House visit
with Vice President Walter Mondale.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, she fell and broke the same elbow again in the
ancient city of Xian during a visit to China.

 THE BIG ROLLERS WIN AT JACK'S  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ They're lined up like dominoes, and with a flick
of a finger, down they go.
</P>
<P>
   Next to fall: Jack's Restaurant, on Sacramento in the Financial
District. Jack's was born in 1864 and will pass away quietly two
days before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Cause of death: Cash strangulation.
</P>
<P>
   Owner John Konstin remodeled the place three years ago, and
while Jack's never quite re-attained its old status as the
epicenter of San Francisco political and financial
wheeling/dealing, business has been brisk.
</P>
<P>
   But the real estate guys made Konstin an unsolicited offer he
couldn't refuse for the old three-story building: $5 mil.
</P>
<P>
   ALSO OUTTAHERE: In Shape At Andres (no apostrophe), the city's
last (so they say) exercise studio that is strictly no-membership,
all-classes.
</P>
<P>
   Cause of death: Rent just doubled. In Shape is on Hayes near
Gough, and they've been buffing you up and sleeking you down since
'82.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon,'' sighs In Shape boss Cheryl Rohsik, ``every corner in
the city will be Starbucks, Walgreens, Gap and 24 Hour Nautilus.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong, Cheryl! On some corners, 24 Hour Nautilus will be muscled
out by Rite Aid.
</P>
<P>
   HEY, MOM! Back-to-school reminder: For the kiddies, pack lunch,
not heat!
</P>
<P>
   At Ross School (``A California Distinguished School''), they're
redefining old standards. In the school handbook, the following

</P>
<P>
   -- ``No ... personal  &UR; athletic equipment  &LR; (game boys (sic),
Walkman, remote control cars, balls) ...''

 &LR;  I'm sure Clymer is an excellent newsguy and all that. But he
misconstrued a conversation between George W. Bush and Dick Cheney,
overheard when Shrub &AMP; Sidekick didn't realize Bush's mike was
live.
</P>
<P>
   Bush: ``There's Adam Clymer, major-league a_ from the New York
Times.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney: ``Oh, yeah he is. Big time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clymer said he was ``disappointed.'' Apparently he didn't
realize Bush and Cheney were paying him a compliment.

   Good thing for Bush and Cheney that it wasn't some hot babe

   DOG SCOOP: Monday's column on the lady in Mission Terrace whose
lawn is being assaulted by dogs with nonscooping owners brought an
avalanche of suggested solutions.
</P>
<P>
   The practical: A motion sensor hooked to a sprinkler.
</P>
<P>
   The kind-hearted: A small trash can, plastic baggies and a box
of cookies with a smiley-face on the box and a thank-you sign.
(Thanks, Ellie Bush. Say hi to Santa Claus for me).
</P>
<P>
   The cruel but possibly effective: Sprinkle pepper and/or cayenne
powder on the lawn and on droppings ... Hide in bushes and nail 'em
with high powered water gun or paintball gun ... Toss some
hot-pepper-stuffed meatballs around the lawn ... Rent an elephant,
follow the bad humans back to their house and reciprocate ...
Dribble bacon grease on previously-deposited piles, watch as dog
owners recoil in terror at Fido's feast.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, I endorse only the cruelty-lite solutions:
Sprinklers, elephant, bacon grease.

   WHERE'S LOTFI? The season-preview issue of the San Francisco
Opera News Magazine notes that Lotfi Mansouri is coming to the end
of his 49-year association with the Opera, 12 of those seasons as
general director.
</P>
<P>
   He did a heck of a job. Maybe that's why the 34-page magazine
has 17 photos of Lotfi.

   BIG NATE no ingrate: The city is considering naming the
basketball courts in the Golden Gate Park Panhandle after Nate
Thurmond, former great Warriors center.
</P>
<P>
   And Nate sez: ``I'm not Joe DiMaggio.``
</P>
<P>
   Translation: I would accept the honor with dignity and humility.
</P>
<P>
   I'm pretty sure Nate didn't mean that as a shot at the late
Yankee Clipper. But it's sad when a local legend's name is
synonymous with ingratitude.
</P>
<P>
   Here's my revised take on the city's plan to name North Beach
Playground after Joe: Hell no.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer who is suing the city to stop the renaming of the
playground was DiMaggio's dear friend, Joe said so in his will. We
have to assume the lawyer knows more than we do about what Joe
woulda wanted.
</P>
<P>
   So forget it. Name the playground after Dom DiMaggio, Joe's
brother and also a former star center fielder, plus a gentleman who
says he has fond memories of the playground.
</P>
<P>
   If Joe's attorney wants a bridge or an airport named after Joe,
let the attorney build a bridge or an airport.

911 OPERATER MEETS LITTLE GIRL HE HELPED SAVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LISA VAN PROYEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. _ Moments after a 2-year-old girl nearly
drowned in a Van Nuys spa, 911 dispatcher Edward Martin calmly gave
directions that helped revive her.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a day after the incident, Martin saw the tot,
Cheyenne Padilla, whose scream heard by telephone had sounded
marvelous to him. And her parents, her sister Jasmine, 6, and her
grandmother met Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an angel,'' said the grandmother, Beverly Howerton, 54.
``The man was totally in control and helped me know where to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, a Los Angeles Fire Department dispatcher in the 911
center for 14 years, was humble about his role in saving the child.
</P>
<P>
   He praised Howerton for keeping her composure in a crisis and
calmly relaying his instructions to her son-in-law, Darrick
Padilla, who performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on his little
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``With her demeanor, I didn't think we had an emergency. I'm
here more to pay tribute to you folks,'' Martin said on a visit to
the Padilla family's home in Simi Valley on Tuesday, which also
happened to be Martin's 49th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting 2-year-old Cheyenne, released from a hospital Monday
night in good condition, made his birthday complete, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could hardly wait to see the child. We can actually see a
beginning and an end,'' said Martin, who handles about 1,100
emergency calls daily from his base in downtown Los Angeles but
seldom meets those who benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Martin formally shook hands with the tot, who decided to pull
out and use her play camera while adult photographers surrounded
her.
</P>
<P>
   The fire dispatcher reflected on his joy during the 911 call
when he heard Cheyenne let out a loud cry in the background,
signaling she was breathing again.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a great scream,'' Martin told the family. ``I'm a
father, too, so I know what you were going through. I was very
happy to hear her scream. I almost wanted to laugh. It was a very
clear scream that sounded great.''
</P>
<P>
   The terrifying ordeal began shortly before 3 p.m. Monday when
the family was gathered at Howerton's home in Van Nuys, Calif., for
a swim and lunch on Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   The father was in the pool with his daughters. Cheyenne vanished
when his attention momentarily was distracted from her.
</P>
<P>
   His mother-in-law had gone into her home to answer the phone,
and he followed to see if Cheyenne was there. Then Jasmine spotted
her sister at the bottom of the spa and ran for her dad, who
quickly pulled out the child.
</P>
<P>
   The father, certified in infant and child CPR, found his
daughter had a pulse but was not breathing. He gave her
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation while his mother-in-law called 911.
The father was grateful for a CPR partner via phone.
</P>
<P>
   The dispatcher ``reclarified whether we were doing the right
thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Through the grandmother, Martin passed along crucial
instructions, including turning the child face-up and tilting her
on her side, checking for a heartbeat and calming down the mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, we were on the same page,'' the father said.
``You did a good job,'' he told Martin.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the fire dispatcher played the 911 tape to the media
and family, quickly drawing tears from Cheyenne's mother, Kristine
Padilla.
</P>
<P>
   Before giving a hug to the child's mother, Martin told the
family, ``You guys did a good job.''

 &HT;    HE'S A WELLSPRING FOR CHICANO MUSIC(a) 
 &HT;    By DANIEL GONZALEZ(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - It's been years since Lalo Guerrero visited the
Tucson neighborhood where he grew up, and on a recent driving tour,
he is having trouble remembering all the streets clearly. But there
is one place he has no trouble finding.
</P>
<P>
   It's on Meyer Street in the heart of the Barrio Viejo, Tucson's
oldest Mexican-American neighborhood, just a few doors from
Guerrero's boyhood home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to stop right here,'' Guerrero says, his mood
turning melancholy. ``That's where Emma lived. My first love.''
</P>
<P>
   He is pointing at some white row houses with little blue
windows. It was outside one of those windows that Guerrero used to
serenade Emma at 2 a.m. with his guitar.
</P>
<P>
   There is no historic marker here, but there should be, because
it was here that the career of the man known as the Father of
Chicano Music was born.
</P>
<P>
   For more than six decades, Eduardo ``Lalo'' Guerrero has been
singing songs about his beloved Mexican-American culture, weaving
two worlds into one while serving as a sort of bicultural musical
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Guerrero will be among six Latinos honored at the Arizona
Biltmore by the human services agency Valle del Sol.
</P>
<P>
   The 83-year-old singer and composer, who has penned more than
200 songs and continues to perform with all the zest of a teenager,
will be the eighth person inducted into the agency's Profiles of
Success Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero was the first musician to fuse American swing with
traditional Mexican music; and long before Ricky Martin, Guerrero
pioneered the art of singing in both English and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   `True Chicano legend'
</P>
<P>
   His career has endured the changing times by his ability to
write, sing and perform in an array of styles - corridos, swing,
boleros, rancheras, rock, mariachi, even comic parody best captured
in his song (beginitalic)Pancho Lopez (enditalic)sung to the tune
of (beginitalic)The Ballad of Davy
(enditalic)(beginitalic)Crockett.(enditalic)
</P>
<P>
   His ballad, (beginitalic)Cancion Mexicana(enditalic), written
when Guerrero was 21, is a classic in Mexico. First recorded in
1941 by the legendary Mexican singer Lucha Reyes, it is a tribute
to the beauty and emotion of Mexican music, something Guerrero
captured to the point of perfection.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to a mariachi festival or a holiday festival and ask
for the most authentic Mexican song, this is the song they would
sing for you,'' says Leticia Quezada, head of the Mexican Cultural
Institute in Los Angeles. ``I was born in Mexico, and I grew up
never knowing that this song was written by an American.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guerrero is a true Chicano legend,'' Quezada adds. ``He is
someone who has been able to create a fusion of traditional Mexican
music and turn it into an expression of the Chicano experience, the
Mexican-American experience in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's award will be only the latest in a long string of
accomplishments for Guerrero, capped in 1996 when President Clinton
presented him with the National Medal of the Arts during a ceremony
at the White House. Fellow recipients included playwright Edward
Albee, actor-director Robert Redford and the Boys Choir of Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, the Smithsonian Institute declared him a ``National
Folk Treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, (beginitalic)Papa's Dream(enditalic), a collection of
13 folk songs recorded by Guerrero and Los Lobos was nominated for
a Grammy as Best Musical Album for Children. Guerrero wrote the
lyrics to several songs on the album, an adventure to Mexico on a
blimp narrated by Guerrero as the lovable bilingual grandfather
``Papa Lalo.''
</P>
<P>
   Bienvenido a Barrio Viejo
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero was born in Tucson's Barrio Viejo on Christmas Eve
1916, yet he remains a bit of an enigma in his home state, perhaps
because he left Arizona when he was 20 to seek his fortune in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he was born in Arizona, but we consider him ours,''
Quezada says.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but Guerrero still considers Arizona home and visits
often. He lives in Cathedral City, Calif., near Palm Springs,
Calif., with his second wife, Lidia.
</P>
<P>
   His official biography says Guerrero was one of 24 children, but
Guerrero says the number is an exaggeration. It was more like 18,
with eight children surviving to adulthood, he says. A sister,
Connie, still lives in Tucson and a brother, Ruben, lives in
north-central Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero's father was from La Paz, Baja California, his mother
from Santa Ana, Sonora. Fleeing violence during the Mexican
Revolution, they moved to Tucson in 1911. Guerrero says his mother,
Concepcion, gave him his talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``She played the guitar, sang and danced beautifully,'' Guerrero
recalls. ``If she had been born during a different era, she would
have been in show biz.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucson, the home of one of the oldest Mexican-American
communities in the United States, has produced many talented
musicians, among them Linda Rondstadt, whom Guerrero sang to when
she was a little girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the breeding ground for Mexican-American music, Big
Band music, and Lalo came out of that tradition,'' says Arturo
Rosales, an Arizona State University history professor.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Guerrero honored his old neighborhood in the song
(beginitalic)Barrio Viejo(enditalic). It is a haunting piece of
music that ends with these lines:
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)Let us die together.
</P>
<P>
   Let them bury me in your soil
</P>
<P>
   And we'll be two corpses
</P>
<P>
   surrounded by a thousand memories.
</P>
<P>
   (enditalic)During a recent visit to Tucson, Guerrero takes time
to point out some of the places from his youth in the Barrio Viejo.
</P>
<P>
   After years of neglect, the Barrio Viejo has been rediscovered
by developers, the same way a new generation of listeners has found
Guerrero's music. Many of the old adobe houses are under renovation
and repainted with bright colors typically found in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   At the corner of Simpson and Convent streets, Guerrero is
surprised to find someone living in the house where he was born.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero sweeps past the towering St. Augustine Cathedral, where
he was baptized, confirmed, received his first Communion and where,
he says, ``I'll probably get the last rites.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, he pauses at the Teatro Carmen, where a historic marker in
front identifies the building as the first theater in Tucson
devoted to dramatic works in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's on to the house on Meyer Street where Guerrero grew
up, where he says he spent the best years of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knew each other, everybody cared about each other.
None of this violence stuff,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The house has a long sloping roof and is easily the biggest
house on the block.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were like big shots,'' Guerrero boasts. ``My dad worked for
the railroad, and he did quite well.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Guerrero says, his family was poor compared with Whites
living across the railroad tracks on the other side of town.
</P>
<P>
   Memories of a first love
</P>
<P>
   Before the tour of the Barrio Viejo is over, Guerrero insists on
one last stop. Emma's old home.
</P>
<P>
   When Guerrero was 5 or 6, a small pox epidemic swept through
town. The disease left his skin covered with pockmarks.
Neighborhood children called him (beginitalic)cacaro,
(enditalic)''crater face,'' and other names.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls wouldn't have anything to do with me,'' Guerrero says.
``Not Emma. She was the first girl that was good to me, who
inspired me and who kissed me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give her the credit for pulling me out of the prison I was
in. She made me believe in me again. She gave me the courage and
the inspiration and the strength to try to become somebody. I owe
her a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the car, Guerrero begins to sing softly in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)''Do you know, my life, why I cry?
</P>
<P>
   Because I love you. Because I adore you.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know why I'll never forget you?
</P>
<P>
   Because you were my first love.''

JUDGE'S SEALED ORDER TO GRANT LOS ALAMOS SCIENTIST BAIL MADE
PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS for rewriting thruout)  
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lawyers for the former Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho
Lee filed a brief Tuesday with the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Denver urging that it reject as disingenuous government
arguments against granting bail to Lee, because prosecutors had
shaped many of the terms of his proposed home detention.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier motion, prosecutors had said the conditions for
granting bail were inadequate, since they still would not prevent
him from using his wife to spirit nuclear secrets to a hostile
power. Under those conditions she would be allowed to come and go,
with permission, from their house.
</P>
<P>
   In its motion Tuesday, the defense argued that since the
government itself had proposed some of the more stringent terms of
Lee's home detention, like the placement of video cameras in his
garden, it could not now say those terms were inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   The trial judge handling the case, James Parker of U.S. District
Court in Albuquerque, issued an order on Aug. 24, saying he had
decided that Lee, who is charged with illegally downloading a large
number of nuclear weapons secrets while at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory, should be released to a strict form of home detention
on $1 million bail. Parker's order reversed his ruling of last
December, when he agreed with the government that Lee posed such a
threat to national security that he had to be jailed until his
trial, scheduled for November.
</P>
<P>
   But in a confusing twist, the judge raised questions about
whether his written decision granting bail had been improperly made
public. Last Thursday, Parker wrote a new 17-page opinion, stating
why he had changed his mind, and it was filed with the court that
day. But it was placed under seal so government officials could
determine if it contained classified information.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend the new opinion became public when it was
included with a motion filed by the U.S. attorney in Albuquerque
seeking an appeal of the bail decision. Once prosecutors filed
their appeal, they handed the order to defense attorneys and said
it was now public, and it was distributed.
</P>
<P>
   In describing his order's becoming public, Parker said Tuesday
that he did not believe anyone intended to violate his order but
added that he was concerned because his written opinion had slipped
out in a way that seemed contrary to his aim of distributing his
orders more straightforwardly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there were bad intentions on anyone's part,'' he
said. But, he added, ``I honestly don't know the status of it
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Classifiers at the Department of Energy apparently reviewed the
document, deleted a few details and gave it to the U.S. attorney on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney then attached the opinion, which pokes
numerous holes in the government's case, to its emergency appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Lee remains in prison pending the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's decision has still not been posted on the federal
court's official Web site or released at the courthouse. Patricia
Chavez, the spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney, said the office
would have no comment.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion is important in part because it casts deep doubts
about many of the government's assertions about Lee's supposed
deceptiveness and the value of the secrets he is accused of
downloading, issues at the heart of the prosecution's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The totality of the information of which I now have knowledge
presents a tableau different from that described by the government
last December,'' the judge wrote. ``Instead of being confined, as
it was then, to an umbral area of pitch-black darkness, the
relevant information has shifted to a penumbral region that is a
somewhat mottled shade of gray.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally, government witnesses had testified that Lee had
downloaded the ``crown jewels'' of the U.S. weapons program, but in
his order Parker said that new information presented at the latest
bail hearing demonstrated that the information ``no longer is so
clearly deserving of that label.'' He pointedly quoted a defense
expert who called the government's assertions ``unbridled
exaggeration.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he was still concerned about some of Lee's
actions, particularly a meeting in a Beijing hotel room in 1988
with two senior Chinese nuclear weapons scientists that was not
fully disclosed to the government for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   But Parker said he now either had dismissed many of the
government's other claims about Lee's alleged deceptions or had
grave doubts about them. For instance, he said, he had been most
influenced by an FBI agent's testimony in December that Lee had
lied to a colleague to gain access to a computer he needed to
download the secret data. That agent, Robert Messemer, admitted in
court several weeks ago that Lee had not lied.
</P>
<P>
   Parker also noted that Messemer had testified earlier that he
anticipated that there would be a sharp increase in efforts by
enemy agents to find seven missing computer tapes on which Lee had
placed much of data he improperly downloaded. In the latest
hearing, Messemer conceded that no such activity had materialized.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also wrote that he had changed his mind about granting
bail because of the government's new charge that Lee had committed
the acts not because he was spying but in an effort to help him get
a job at some foreign scientific institutes, most in countries like
Australia, Singapore and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enhancing one's resume,'' Parker wrote, ``is less sinister
than the treacherous motive the government, at least by
implication, ascribed to Dr. Lee at the end of last year.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote that Lee had not only done little to conceal his
downloading, and also knew full well that there were monitoring
systems that would detect what he was doing. At one point when he
was trying to erase some files, however, Lee called an open help
line at the laboratory to seek assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This suggests that Dr. Lee's actions may not have been as
surreptitious, clandestine, and secretive as the government
originally indicated,'' Parker wrote.
</P>
<P>
   And in a long footnote, he expressed anger that the government
``seems to have procrastinated in removing unduly onerous
conditions of confinement'' that he had asked be eased at the
beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Parker described some of the conditions as ``demeaning.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted, however, that, more than eight months later, the
conditions have been improved, and he assured the government that
his dismay over the slow response had not colored his decision to
free Lee on bail.

VENUS PASSES FIRST REAL TEST; HINGIS NEXT

<P>
   FLUSHING MEADOWS, N.Y. _ Venus Williams grimly walked to her
chair during a changeover, went to sit down _ and missed.
</P>
<P>
   A gasp went up from the spectators, then a few nervous laughs as
Williams quickly got up, greatly embarrassed but otherwise unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   The incident served as a symbolic snapshot of Williams' day.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Open favorites aren't supposed to fall out of their chairs,
and neither are they supposed to struggle in the quarterfinals. But
Williams did both.
</P>
<P>
   She lost her first set of the tournament before subduing No. 8
Nathalie Tauziat, 6-4, 1-6, 6-1, Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play up to par,'' Williams said. ``There's no excuse.
I just didn't play.''
</P>
<P>
   Her next opponent did.
</P>
<P>
   Martina Hingis dispatched Monica Seles in the other women's
quarterfinal, 6-0, 7-5, to advance to a rematch of last year's
semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   That one was won by Hingis in three sets. This one was supposed
to belong to Williams, even though at No. 3 she's seeded two spots
behind her rival.
</P>
<P>
   Williams entered with the favorite's mantle after winning her
past four tournaments, but Tauziat sounded the alarm both on the
court and in the post-match debriefing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she wins the tournament, she needs to improve her level,''
Tauziat said. ``I think she's not going to win if she plays like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis clearly is playing her best tennis. The No. 1 seed has
dropped just 15 games in winning five matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm playing better and better each match, picking it
up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She dominated the first set so thoroughly that she won all but
six points. A resurgent Seles broke Hingis twice in the second set
and was serving to send it into a tiebreaker, but Hingis broke for
the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just happy to close it out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also has played her best tennis for most of the
tournament, getting to the quarterfinals without dropping a set.
</P>
<P>
   Against Tauziat, though, she appeared vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a while since I've played a match like that, but I
can't accept these types of things,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of it was Tauziat's style. She's one of the few
serve-and-volleyers left on tour. She doesn't have the power of
some of the big hitters like Williams, but her relentless,
attacking style can pose problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was rushing sometimes,'' Williams said. ``You think your
time is taken away from you a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   She needed a late service break to win the first set, then was
routed in the shocking second set.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the first set I was very, very frustrated,''
Tauziat said. ``I broke her in the beginning of the second set, and
that gave me confidence and I played better.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams became so frustrated with what she called the worst set
she's played during her 24-match winning streak that she almost
lost her customary cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never get upset when I'm playing, but today it was very
strange,'' she said. ``I was trying hard not to stomp my feet,
swing my racket around. I'm not used to that. Some players show a
lot of emotion, but usually I don't. That was maybe the main battle
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   She regrouped in the third set, winning it and the match
handily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do anything much better, I just made some more shots
and was more determined,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But even the final set wasn't without a tense moment or two.
Williams was up two breaks and serving at 4-0, but double-faulted
three times and dropped her serve.
</P>
<P>
   It was after that game that she missed her chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really missed,'' she said. ``I was just angry, and I
couldn't see.''
</P>
<P>
   At least, though, she could talk about a subpar match _ and the
embarrassment of missing the chair _ after a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel I had my best performance, to say the least,''
Williams said. ``But in the end, the win is on the record and I
moved forward.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep moving forward, she knows she can't afford another match
like this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'll have to play a little better,'' she said. ``I'll
serve better. I always play better when it comes to a big match.''

FRANCIS' RECORD-SETTING EFFORT AWED MANY, BUT TEXAS TECH SAW IT
COMING

<P>
   LUBBOCK _ Carlos Francis' record-setting 234-yard game as a
receiver in Texas Tech's victory against Utah State on Saturday
drew eye-opening appraisal from around the Big 12, gaining him
Offensive Player of the Week honors.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates and coaches, however, reacted with a relative yawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlos showed everyone in Lubbock and whoever else was
watching what he could do,'' said Kevin Curtis, Tech's
all-conference safety. ``But he shows that every day in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Kliff Kingsbury agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been doing things like that against our defense all
summer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew Carlos was capable of doing that,'' head coach Mike
Leach said. ``It was not really a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis, too, seemed singularly unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things just clicked,'' Francis said, matter-of-factly.
</P>
<P>
   It becomes a matter of fact, however, that the redshirt freshman
speedster from Southwest High School has added another dimension to
Leach's passing-game offense, which is predicated on spreading the
defense horizontally and then finding the open spaces. Francis is
the type of wide receiver who has the ability to stretch that
envelope vertically.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a guy like Carlos _ with his speed in this offense _
is huge,'' Kingsbury said.
</P>
<P>
   Included among his seven receptions against Utah State was a
45-yard touchdown and a 67-yard catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't really see that this is a ball-control offense,''
Red Raiders receivers coach Sonny Dykes said. ``Our deal is to
complete passes. But you have to have that guy who can stretch the
defense \Rdownfield\S so you can throw underneath. One aspect feeds
off the other, and then you take what the defense gives you.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis gives defenses something else to ponder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more they have to worry about,'' Leach said, ``the better
off we are.''
</P>
<P>
   A case in point: In the opener, New Mexico concentrated on
taking away Tech's outside receivers, so the Raiders threw short _
slip-screens, slants and curls. Francis caught one pass for 3
yards. Utah State focused on stopping that aspect of Tech's game,
so the Raiders looked deep, which was part of the game plan anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back at the end of spring training, we sat down and looked and
Carlos had caught more balls \Rin scrimmages\S than anybody,''
Dykes said. ``So after our first ballgame, we decided we needed to
get this guy the ball more and we made a conscious effort to do
that. He responded.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis has been timed running the 40-yard dash in less than 4.3
seconds. But he is more than just a former track star who can run
fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlos is still learning how to play and how to adjust to his
role in this offense,'' Dykes said. ``But for him to have as big a
game as he did this early is a credit to how hard he works. The
physical part of his game is there. The mental is still coming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``God blesses everyone with some kind of ability,'' Francis
said. ``It is up to you to take that ability to another level. I
have good speed, and people respect that. But will they respect the
curl route? Will they respect the out route?
</P>
<P>
   ``People can put you in a zone and shut down your speed. So you
have to be an all-around receiver. That's what I'm trying to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis is a solid 5-foot-9, 188 pounds. In addition to his
speed, he has other attributes that help make him a good receiver,
some you might not expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``People make fun of me because I have big hands and big feet,''
he said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Francis wears size 121/2 shoes. His fingers are longer than
those of the average person of the same height. Long fingers
translate into the term ``good hands.''
</P>
<P>
   He has also emerged nicely from two knee problems. He suffered
cartilage damage at the district track meet his junior year at
Southwest. He partially tore ligaments in his left knee in
preseason workouts a year ago or would have been in Tech's receiver
rotation last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was faster my senior year in high school than I was as a
junior,'' Francis said. ``I'm faster now than I was a year ago. So
the knee problems haven't bothered me.''
</P>
<P>
   Leach said Francis is also surprisingly tough. He recalled an
August practice when Francis had twisted an ankle and had a sore
neck. A member of the training staff told Leach that Francis was
out for the rest of practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlos discovered that and said, `No, I'm not out.' He runs
back out there and starts practicing,'' Leach said. ``And he had a
great practice.''
</P>
<P>
   His former coach at Southwest, Bill Hall, doesn't sound
surprised at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was unique in the sense that he always seemed to know what
he wanted to do,'' Hall said. ``He avoided a lot of the things that
were detrimental that we saw capture a lot of other kids along the
way and end their careers even before they got started. He told me,
`Coach, I've seen guys that came through here \RSouthwest\S who
could have been good but made some bad choices. I don't want that
to be me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Francis is yet another example of a player from the Spike Dykes
era who wasn't highly recruited but blossomed into a major-college
player. Tech was the only Division-I school to offer him a
scholarship. He understands why other recruiters didn't call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respected that,'' Francis said. ``I was coming off knee
surgery as a junior, a player who didn't play on a good team
\R2-8\S at a school that has never been a powerhouse in football.
But I knew that if I could get into a D-I college anywhere, I was
going to make an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   No surprise there, either.

DARRYL SYDOR MIGHT NOT BE READY FOR OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Stars were hoping to have defenseman Darryl
Sydor ready for the season opener Oct. 4, but they might have to
wait a little longer.
</P>
<P>
   Sydor, who tore ligaments in his left ankle in Game 6 of the
Stanley Cup Finals in June, was at Dr Pepper StarCenter on Tuesday
for treatment but said there is progress to be made before he's
ready to move from the ice bags to the ice rink.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still pain. That's how we know it's just not right,''
Sydor said. ``There is pain you can play with, but there is still
certain things I can't do that I need to be able to do them.''
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to get Sydor skating, which he hasn't done
since injuring the ankle. Stars trainer Dave Surprenant said he's
optimistic that will happen while the Stars are in Vail, Colo., for
training camp next week. If not sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get him in skates real soon,'' Surprenant
said. ``Whether or not he gets in a pair of skates before Vail, who
knows. But he'll definitely skate in Vail. Then, we'll go from
there.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to giving a definite yea or nay on Sydor's
availability for the opener, though, Surprenant skips
``definitely'' and retreats to ``hopefully.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Stars learned with winger Jere Lehtinen last season, an
ankle injury can be one of the most difficult injuries for which to
pinpoint a return date because skating puts pressure on the ankle,
slowing the healing process.
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen missed 75 of the Stars' 105 games last season after
fracturing his ankle. Many of his comebacks from the injury were
aborted because of pain.
</P>
<P>
   Sydor neither fractured his ankle nor required surgery as
Lehtinen did, but Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said caution will be
used.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this type of injury, we won't play him until he's
ready,'' Hitchcock said. ``And our experience has been there is a
certain measuring stick. It's a toe drag. When the toe drag can be
made without pain, he's good. He can't do that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not so good.
</P>
<P>
   Sydor is one of the reasons the Stars' top four on defense are
considered the best in the league. It's hard to find a better or
more complementary set than Sydor, Sergei Zubov, Richard Matvichuk
and Derian Hatcher.
</P>
<P>
   But, unlike last season, the Stars don't have a veteran
defenseman anchoring their third defensive pair. Shawn Chambers,
who played that role in camp last season, retired this summer after
three doctors told him that the knee injury that sidelined him for
all but five games in 1999-2000 wasn't getting any better.
</P>
<P>
   The two veteran defenseman the Stars traded for during the
stretch run last season, Sylvain Cote and Dave Manson, are also
gone after signing with other teams in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   So the Stars will break in two young defensemen in the third
defensive pair, Brad Lukowich and Richard Jackman, with further
youth and inexperience backing up that pair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like everybody in the league. If we received a long-term
injury to one of those top four guys, they'd be hard to replace,''
Hitchcock said. ``I'm not concerned, though. Even if \RSydor\S
misses the first couple of games, he wouldn't miss much more.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors initially said Sydor's ankle would heal in eight to 12
weeks, which would put his return near the third week of September.
So if Sydor is indeed going to be ready for the Oct. 4 opener
against Colorado, it will be with only seven or eight practices
under his belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just going to take some time,'' Sydor said.
``There is nothing you can do. You can't speed it up. You just have
to let them heal the way they are going to heal.''

GORE'S ECONOMIC PLAN? HE COULD WRITE A BOOK ON IT, AND DOES

 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The Gore campaign Wednesday released a detailed
economic blueprint for the next decade, including a new proposal
for a $300 billion hedge against overly optimistic budget
projections.
</P>
<P>
   The document also reiterates the vice president's commitment to
eliminate the national debt and lists a broad variety of
socioeconomic goals _ like increasing home ownership, reducing
poverty and narrowing the pay gap between men and women _ that he
hopes to achieve through proposals he previously announced.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's idea for a $300 billion reserve fund _ money that would
not be spent from the federal budget surplus _ is intended to be a
cushion against shortfalls in projections by the Congressional
Budget Office, which estimates a surplus of $1.8 trillion over the
next decade, exclusive of the surplus reaped by the Social Security
system.
</P>
<P>
   While the Gore and Bush campaigns both assume the $1.8 trillion
projected by the CBO, the Clinton administration uses the more
conservative estimate of the White House Office of Management and
Budget: $1.4 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If more conservative OMB projections are met,'' the Gore
blueprint says, ``this will allow an additional $300 billion of
debt reduction. If unexpected costs materialize, this surplus
resource will prevent us from going back to the days of big
deficits, high taxes and deep spending cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan otherwise synthesizes proposals that he has made
over the last several months into a variety of national goals. He
is to discuss it in a speech here on Wednesday, and details are
being published in a 200-page book, unique in modern presidential
campaigns in that it is essentially a budget proposal that will
serve as an economic and political manifesto.
</P>
<P>
   The number-heavy and footnoted book, which was made available to
The New York Times, underscores Gore's determination to supply
specifics in his policy proposals. In that regard, it is intended
to serve as a counterweight to the campaign of Gov. George W. Bush,
which the Gore camp regards as feather-thin on policy and based
largely on personality.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which Gore advisers denied was timed to offset Bush's
proposal today to overhaul Medicare, was drafted for months with
help from Clinton administration experts like Robert Rubin, former
treasury secretary; Laura Tyson, former chairwoman of the Council
of Economic Advisers; and Gene Sperling, Clinton's top economic
adviser. Rubin is to join Gore for the presentation here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign said its blueprint was the road to continued
economic expansion. And realization of the goals that the vice
president laid out, like reducing the poverty level to below 10
percent for the first time in history, and increasing the college
graduation rate to 75 percent of high school graduates from the
current level of 66 percent, depends on that continued prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The sum of Gore's spending initiatives, as presented by his
campaign, is about $1.4 trillion, although Republicans said it
appeared to them that his proposals would mean new spending that
totaled more than the surplus of $1.8 trillion envisioned by the
Congressional Budget Office. An analysis prepared by the Senate
Budget Committee, headed by Senator Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said
Gore had proposed such extensive spending that he would have to dip
into Social Security to pay for his programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign has also proposed targeted tax cuts that it
says amount to $500 billion over 10 years. But Republicans say
these are illusory and so complicated that no one can be sure how
much anyone would save.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign said that its plan was sound and would
eliminate the publicly held federal debt by 2012, while Bush's, it
said, would leave the government $2.8 trillion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the centerpiece of the Gore plan is to eliminate the
debt, through use of Gore's proposed reserve fund and the Social
Security and Medicare surpluses. Gore would protect those surpluses
by barring their use for any other purpose.
</P>
<P>
   One of the plan's socioeconomic goals is to double the number of
families, to 65 million from 32 million, that have at least $50,000
in savings.
</P>
<P>
   Other goals include lowering the income tax burden on the
typical family to the lowest level in 50 years, reducing the
poverty level to below 10 percent, raising the number of families
who own homes to more than 70 percent, reducing the gap between
what men and women earn by 50 percent and creating 10 million
high-technology jobs.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve those goals, the plan offers numerous tax credits and
tax deductions for expenses like college, day care and long-term
care, and to encourage savings.
</P>
<P>
   The plan says that through increased productivity, a Gore
administration could raise family incomes by one-third over the
next decade. It estimates productivity growth at 2.8 percent a
year, by paying down the debt, investing in biomedical research and
computer technology, and opening more markets abroad.
</P>
<P>
   His plan says Gore would reduce the poverty rate to below 10
percent by 2004 from its current level above 12 percent. He would
achieve this by raising the minimum wage, expanding the
earned-income tax credit and creating more welfare-to-work
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also sets a goal of cutting the gap between pay for men
and women.
</P>
<P>
   Women now earn 73 cents for every dollar earned by men,
according to the Council of Economic Advisers. The Gore plan would
cut that gap of 27 cents by almost half, to 14 cents, through
various plans that provide training programs to move women into
higher-paying, high-tech jobs and more loans to help women start
their own businesses.

FORD SAYS TIRE-DEFECT-RELATED EXPLORER CRASHES TOO INFREQUENT TO
DETECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS for updating thruout, story is now 200 words longer)  
(ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.
Nonsubscribers can purchase one-time rights by calling 888-603-1036
or 888-346-9867.) By MATTHEW L. WALD and KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Bridgestone/Firestone tire defect now blamed
for 88 deaths, mainly from crashes of Ford Explorers, eluded
detection for so long because it occurred infrequently, even though
it proved deadlier than many problems that occur more often in
vehicles, Ford Motor and congressional investigators said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The deadliness of the tire problems, combined with a low rate of
warranty claims for poor quality tires, is focusing attention on
whether the design of the Explorer makes it especially vulnerable,
the investigators said. The high death rate associated with a
fairly small number of tire failures is striking because the
nation's last big tire recall, in 1978, involved Firestone tires
that failed frequently but were linked to less than half as many
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators, who portray Ford and Firestone as both
culpable in the crash deaths, also distributed copies Tuesday of an
internal Ford memorandum from March 1999 that showed that Firestone
opposed a tire recall in Saudi Arabia for fear that the tire maker
would have to report it to U.S. regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said it decided to recall Explorers in Saudi Arabia anyway,
at its expense, to replace the tires. But Ford also said it did not
tell U.S. regulators about the decision after Firestone assured it
that the rate of accident claims on identical tires in the United
States was average.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate committees will conduct hearings on Wednesday
to examine what Firestone, Ford and federal regulators knew about
the tire problems, when they knew it, and how they reacted.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional investigators and Ford disagreed Tuesday about the
significance of the fact that Firestone customers turned in few of
the millions of tires for replacement under warranty, yet Firestone
received a high number of claims of property damage, personal
injury and death.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who is chairman of
one of the subcommittees holding hearings scheduled on Wednesday,
said that the problem was ``a lethal combination of a somewhat
unstable vehicle'' with tires prone to shed their treads at high
speed. His own Ford Explorer, a green 1992 model, has been sitting
in his garage for a month, he said, because he cannot find
replacement tires for it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Firestone replaced 17 percent of the 23 million tires
in dispute to settle warranty claims even before that recall.
Though Ford and Firestone have not provided warranty figures for
the current recall, they have said that the figures are not
markedly different from other tires, which typically are replaced
under warranty at rates of one-tenth of 1 percent or less.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Ford denied that a low rate of warranty complaints,
coupled with numerous crash claims, implied that anything was wrong
with the Explorer. Jon Harmon, a Ford spokesman, said that many of
the crashes involved tires on which the warranty had expired, so
that warranty data would not have provided a clue about the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that Explorers equipped with Goodyear tires from
1995 to 1997 have had virtually no problems. Even with the tire
problems, Explorers have a lower death rate in rollovers per
million vehicles on the road than other midsized sport utility
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon also noted that the current dispute has drawn national
attention for only a month and warranty claims might rise; in 1978,
the recall took place after 18 months of disagreement between
Firestone and regulators, but that disagreement attracted much less
attention than now.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Petrauskas, Ford's vice president for environment and
safety issues, said that the warranty data was not always
appropriate for spotting safety problems because it included a lot
of ``chaff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People will complain, `I don't like the way the white
lettering is,' or `it's noisy,''' Petrauskas said. ``If you have
property and injury claims, chances are you've captured the more
serious thing that has happened with the tires.''
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin also complained that Ford had replaced tires for
customers in Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Malaysia, among other
places, without telling the U.S. Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Petrauskas said in a briefing with reporters that Ford
voluntarily informs American regulators of recalls abroad ``if
there's reason to believe that there's a safety defect in the
vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   But the company accepted Firestone's assurances that the
problems in those countries were not relevant to conditions in the
United States, after Firestone engineers dissected sample tires
shipped back to Akron, Ohio, Petrauskas said. Citing Firestone
analyses that failures in Saudi Arabia, in particular, were caused
by improper repairs and severe underinflation, she said she was
still not persuaded that tire problems overseas were relevant to
problems in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Firestone still refuse to recall in the United States
the 16-inch Wilderness tires that were recalled in Saudi Arabia,
saying that they have a low rate of crash claims here. Plaintiffs'
lawyers dispute this.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Ford released a documents intended to show that it
carefully examined tires when foreign customers complained about
them, but it failed to spot a pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone, which is owned by Bridgestone Corp. of Japan,
repeatedly said that the problem was improper repairs or extended
operation at extremely low tire pressures, or both, Petrauskas
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said that rollovers had occurred in 85 of the 1,424
American tread separation cases involving tires now being recalled,
which are 15-inch ATX and ATX II tires of the P235/75R15 size, plus
Wilderness tires of the same size that were made in Decatur, Ill.
Most of the deaths, however, occurred in rollovers.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone, which will probably face criminal charges in
Venezuela, had no comment before the hearings..
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Bridgestone are both liable for damages resulting from
crashes, Tauzin said Tuesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A Bridgestone/Firestone presentation at the International Tire
Exhibition and Conference two years ago in Akron reviewed the tire
maker's experiments with a Ford Explorer equipped with the kind of
tire that was recalled last month. A tire company engineer
concluded that if the tread separated, the result was ``well within
the range of a driver's ability to control a vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford provided a copy of the document, but plaintiffs' lawyers,
and even some Ford officials, say that the bang that accompanies
the tire failure could startle a motorist into swerving or braking
sharply, either one of which could lead to a fatal crash.

PEREZ TAKES HIS LUMPS AS DODGERS FLOUNDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At some point, lefty Carlos Perez will run out of
time and chances with the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, a bundle of a those moments have already passed, but
there are millions upon millions of reasons (i.e., dollars) why he
continues to get opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   But another lousy performance, and questionable health, might
finally put an end to Perez's chances _ at least for this season
after Pittsburgh embarrassed the Dodgers 8-0 Tuesday in front of a
season-low 22,780 at Dodger Stadium. In the first two games of the
series, the Dodgers have been outscored by the Pirates 20-1.
</P>
<P>
   They've also been shut down by two pitchers who had similar
numbers to Perez. Jimmy Anderson pitched a complete game Monday,
and right-hander Jose Silva (9-9) further frustrated the Dodgers on
Tuesday. Silva was 1-5 with a 13.50 ERA in August and allowed eight
runs in 3 innings in his last start.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers managed just five hits in seven innings against
Silva, who pitched at least six innings for the first time since
July 26. After Tom Goodwin led off the bottom of the first with a
single, Silva retired the next 11 batters and 14 of 15.
</P>
<P>
   Perez was smacked around again, this time by Pittsburgh. In the
end, Perez exited with a strained left rotator cuff and an enormous
deficit. He allowed six runs on 10 hits in 3 innings before
suffering .
</P>
<P>
   The initial diagnosis is a mild strain of the left rotator cuff,
but he will be re-examined today. His status for his next start,
art, because of his health. But the same questions that led to his
being sent to the minors last July still exist.
</P>
<P>
   And though Perez (5-8) has more than doubled his win total from
last season, that's of little consequence since he has one win
since May 20.
</P>
<P>
   If the injury didn't knock Perez out, the Pirates would likely
have done so shortly thereafter. Perez, who's ERA is 5.56, was
touched for three runs in the first inning and allowed eight hits
before he recorded his fourth out.
</P>
<P>
   Though Perez threw well in non-pressure situations out of the
bullpen, his return to the rotation has been anything but glorious.
He earned the win Aug. 25 against Chicago, but was lambasted for
six runs in two-plus innings last Thursday in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson said he was staying with Perez because
they were facing teams that had trouble against left-handers. The
Pirates, who were batting .266 against left-handers and .264
against right-handers, seemed to fall in the line of opponents
having little problem against Perez.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates took a 3-0 lead in the first, with the final two
runs coming on Keith Osik's single to left. Pat Meares led off the
second with a homer and Pittsburgh extended its lead to 6-0 in the
fourth. Jason Kendall had an RBI double against Perez, who came out
of the game while facing Giles, the next hitter. Matt Herges
relieved and allowed an RBI double to Alex Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   Perez's exit marked the seventh time in 22 starts he's failed to
pitch at least five innings. In his past five starts, Perez had
made it into the fifth inning once. During that time he's 1-4 with
an 11.37 ERA. In his past two starts he has a 15.88 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Perez, who was 2-10 with a 7.43 ERA last season, continues
to get opportunities because of his contract situation. Perez has
another season left on a three-year, $15.6 million contract he
signed after the 1998 season.

NEW YORKER DESCRIBES HARSH IMPRISONMENT IN PERU
</HEADLINE>
  By SHAILA K. DEWAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In her only interview from a Peruvian jail, Lori Berenson
describes the harsh conditions of her confinement and tells how her
captors have mistreated her fellow prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The interview was conducted in March 1999 by Pacifica Radio, and
was made public only Tuesday. The Peruvian government decided last
week to grant Berenson a new trial and void her life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   But in the interview, to be broadcast at 9 a.m. Wednesday,
Berenson said that a new trial would be a delaying tactic for the
Peruvian government, which has faced criticism from the U.S.
government and the Organization of American States about the case.
Berenson, a New Yorker, was convicted of treason in January 1996 by
a military tribunal in which judges wore ski masks and her lawyers
were not allowed to cross-examine witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``With such publicity that I've had, such negative publicity
that I've had in Peru, I would never get a fair trial,'' she said,
according to a transcript of the interview provided by Pacifica.
She added that no evidence had been presented at her first trial.
</P>
<P>
   The interview was conducted in the Socabaya jail in Peru by Amy
Goodman, the host of the Pacifica program ``Democracy Now,'' but
was not broadcast immediately out of concern that Berenson would
suffer repercussions, Goodman said Tuesday. But last week, Berenson
was moved to Lima, out of the reach of Socabaya prison officials.
</P>
<P>
   According to the transcript, Berenson said that in December 1995
she spent 11 or 12 days in a cell with a woman who had five bullet
wounds. ``They had left her on a dirty mattress, naked,'' Berenson
said. ``A filthy mattress with five open wounds, which is pretty
horrendous. I mean, there were rats in my bed and things like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Berenson, 30, has had health problems from the high altitude of
Yanamayo, the Andean prison where she was held for the first three
years of her imprisonment. But she told Goodman she was not moved
to Socabaya until the day before the OAS Human Rights Commission
was scheduled to hear her case.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson criticized the United States for what she said was its
cozy relationship with President Alberto Fujimori of Peru.
``There's been some pressure at certain times, but not heavy
pressure, not heavy enough pressure, because I'm still here,'' she
said.

EX-DOCTOR TO ADMIT TO MURDERING 3 PATIENTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio., Ill, W. Va., Iowa, Colo.)  By CHARLIE LeDUFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ A former physician who the authorities say
poisoned patients from Ohio to Zimbabwe but continued to find
medical jobs will plead guilty in federal court Wednesday to
charges that he killed three patients at a Long Island hospital in
1993, prosecutors said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The former doctor, Michael J. Swango, will admit that he
murdered the three men with poison while working at the Northport
Veterans Affairs Medical Center on Long Island, according to Gary
R. Brown, the assistant U. S. attorney who is prosecuting the case.
Beyond that, Brown would offer no particulars about the plea
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But an official familiar with the negotiations between
prosecutors and lawyers for Swango, 45, said that by accepting the
deal he would avoid the death penalty in New York and extradition
to Zimbabwe, where the authorities have issued a warrant for
Swango's arrest on charges that he poisoned seven patients, five of
them fatally, when he worked there from November 1994 to July 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The official said that the former doctor would also plead guilty
Wednesday before Judge Jacob Mishler of U.S. District Court to mail
and wire fraud charges. Within the description of those charges,
Swango is accused of assaulting two patients in Africa, another
elderly patient at the Veterans Hospital and a patient at Ohio
State University Hospitals, all of whom died in his care, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Randi Chavis, a lawyer for Swango, would not comment on the plea
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   With the agreement, prosecutors say they will close the book on
one of the most bizarre and unsettling stories in modern medicine.
It seemed that no matter where Swango went, allegations, suspicion
and death followed. According to the book ``Blind Eye: The
Terrifying Story of a Doctor Who Got Away With Murder'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster, 1999), by James B. Stewart, questions about Swango began
to surface as early 1982, when he was a medical student at Southern
Illinois University. After an inordinate number of his patients
died, classmates called him Double-0 Swango, joking that he had a
license to kill.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors believe that while working as an intern the next
year at Ohio State University Hospitals, Swango murdered or tried
to murder a number of patients by injecting them with poison. In
his plea, it is expected that Swango will also acknowledge that he
lied to the hospital investigators in connection with the death of
the Ohio State Hospitals patient, Cynthia McGee, 19, in January
1984. Prosecutors said that Swango murdered her by giving her a
potassium injection that caused her heart to stop.
</P>
<P>
   After several mysterious deaths, but no hard evidence, the Ohio
State University Hospitals &UR;  &LR; ended Swango's neurosurgery residency.
He then returned home to Illinois, where he got a job as a
emergency medical technician with the Adams County Ambulance
Service. While working there, he got into a dispute with co-workers
and laced their doughnuts and coffee with ant killer. Five people
became ill but no one died. Swango served two years of a five-year
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   When released from prison, Swango applied to residency programs
in West Virginia and Iowa, but administrators noticed his falsified
records, and his applications were rejected. He tried a third time
in 1993 at the Veterans hospital in Northport, N.Y., and was
accepted. The day after he was hired, his first patient, Dominic
Buffalino, fell into a coma and died.
</P>
<P>
   Three more patients died of lethal injections delivered by
Swango, prosecutors said: Thomas Sammarco, 73; George Siano, 60;
and Aldo Serini, all of Long Island. Swango will plead guilty to
their murders on Wednesday, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials charged Swango with the three murders in July, just as
he was about to be released from prison in Colorado, where he was
serving a three-and-a-half-year term for lying his way into the
Northport hospital. After exhuming the men's bodies, forensic
experts determined that they had indeed been poisoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard the news this afternoon'' Siano's stepdaughter,
Roselinda Conroy, said today about the plea agreement. She said she
had always assumed that her father had died from natural causes.
``I'm absorbing it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of Buffalino said that they were happy that a serial
killer would be removed from society, but would remain dissatisfied
until the cause of his death was properly identified. ``I'm glad he
can't kill anymore, but I would like to see some answers in terms
of my brother,'' said Andrew Buffalino, 70, of Huntington. ``My
interest now is one thing. I want to see an autopsy report.''
</P>
<P>
   After Northport officials learned of Swango's criminal record,
they fired him. He became a physician at Mnene Mission Hospital in
Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, using forged documents form the Federation of
State Medical Boards. He is still wanted in that country.
</P>
<P>
   Swango was eventually arrested in 1997 in Chicago while waiting
for a flight to Saudi Arabia, where he had a new job as a doctor.

SLAM DUNK _ RED SOX COAST

 SOX-A'S-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A Red Sox player who is awaiting a hearing on whether
he is juiced hit the first grand slam of his career Tuesday &UR;  &LR; night
off an Oakland pitcher who complained that the baseball was
``greasy.''
</P>
<P>
   This could be the first playoff race decided on the basis of DNA
evidence and fingerprint samples.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Alexander, the reserve Sox infielder who was to have been
in Dorchester District Court Wednesday for a hearing on whose
illegal steroids were found in the glove compartment of the
Mercedes he loaned to a team batboy more than two months ago, took
A's pitcher Kevin Appier deep with the bases loaded, the unexpected
climax of a seven-run first inning that propelled the Sox to a 10-3
win over Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, who must answer to an application for a criminal
complaint but has not been charged, won't be in court Wednesday.
His hearing was postponed until Oct. 18, with another continuance
almost certain if the Sox make it to the postseason for a third
straight year for the first time in their 100-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, who scored in double figures for the first time in 44
games (July 20, the same day Pete Schourek last pitched), remained
two games behind the Cleveland Indians in the AL wild-card race and
six games behind the Yankees in the AL East with 27 to play. The
A's, who had won four in a row, fell three games behind the Indians
in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, a.k.a. Friend of Sammy, said he was expecting a phone
call and perhaps a bottle of champagne from Cubs slugger Sammy
Sosa, his longtime amigo and countryman from the Dominican
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he's going to call me _ I call him when he hits one,''
said Alexander, who presumably sets aside considerably more pesos
for his phone bill than Sammy does his.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander's grand slam, which landed just inside the left-field
foul pole, was his third home run this season. Sosa has 45.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' winning pitcher Schourek said when asked
whether he'd ever given up a home run to Alexander when both were
in the National League. ``He may have hit a deep fly ball off me. I
gave up a lot of home runs to the Cubs there, but I don't think he
was one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schourek, who is pitching on borrowed time _ he expects to
have postseason surgery on his left elbow and shoulder _ may never
have faced Alexander while laboring under the handicap claimed
Tuesday &UR;  &LR; night by Appier.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran righthander, who faced 11 hitters in a first inning
in which the Sox did not score until after Carl Everett hit into a
double play, complained bitterly that the baseballs, which normally
are rubbed with a secret mud before each game, felt more like
they'd been dipped in Brylcreem.
</P>
<P>
   ``They felt greasy,'' said Appier, who got to wash his hands in
the third inning, when doubles by Donnie Sadler and Trot Nixon made
it 8-0 and sent him to the dugout to contemplate his shortest start
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Appier tossed a ball into the A's dugout. ``Look
at the ball,'' he shouted to manager Art Howe and pitching coach
Rick Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson gave credence to Appier's lament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost felt like there was lotion on the ball,'' Peterson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Howe brought Appier's complaint to the attention of plate umpire
Randy Marsh, who offered the not unreasonable opinion that the
baseballs didn't seem to be bothering Schourek. Very little did.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek, who was battered in four July starts (0-3, 11.57)
before admitting that his arm was close to disintegrating,
postponed surgery while checking to see whether he could continue
to pitch with bone chips in his elbow and a frayed rotator cuff in
his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by two rehab starts in the minors and a three-inning
simulated game, Schourek was activated four days ago and given Jeff
Fassero's spot in the rotation. He didn't allow a hit until Jason
Giambi's homer over the Sox bullpen with one out in the fourth, and
gave up just two hits before leaving with one out in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long time coming,'' Schourek said of his first win
since May 15. ``I'm proud of myself for the way I worked, the
attitude I had to try and come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to sit at home and watch the guys play the rest
of the season. I wanted to give it a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   His job was made easier by the Sox' biggest inning since they
scored seven in the third against the Twins on July 5.
</P>
<P>
   After Everett rolled into a double play, Nomar Garciaparra
singled home Trot Nixon _ the first of seven successive hitters to
reach. Troy O'Leary walked, Dante Bichette singled to load the
bases, and Scott Hatteberg's broken-bat single scored two more runs
to make it 3-0. Sadler walked to bring up Alexander, whose home run
settled in the net, just inside the foul pole.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon had three hits. Garciaparra, who went 15 games without
driving in a run, knocked in three with a double and single, giving
him four RBIs in two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was really great for Pete,'' said Bichette, who had two
singles. ``I faced him a lot in the past. He showed some of the
same stuff. He freezes you with that big breaking curveball and
works off the corners with his fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it the dry look.

other single employer. Some of the complaints escalated into costly
litigation, while others festered, undermining morale. But in 1994
as part of a settlement of a class-action lawsuit, lawyers at the
Postal Service, the nation's largest employer, started an ambitious
experiment in dispute resolution. They created a program settle
disputes using outside neutral mediators. The lawyers estimate that
the program has saved the agency millions of dollars in legal costs
and improved productivity. Now, two of the Postal Service's lawyers
have left for private practice and are taking a similar program on

CLYDE SUKEFORTH, 98, IS DEAD; STEERED ROBINSON TO MAJORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clyde Sukeforth, the Brooklyn Dodger scout and manager who
accompanied Jackie Robinson through two of the Hall of Fame
player's milestones as the first African-American in modern
baseball, died on Sunday at his home in Waldoboro, Maine He was 98.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, when the major league teams had an unwritten policy to
ignore black players, Sukeforth was assigned by Branch Rickey, the
Dodgers' president, to scout Robinson, then the Kansas City
Monarchs' shortstop, at a Negro Leagues game in Chicago before
bringing him back for what would be a historic meeting in the
Dodger offices in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Jack came out on the field,'' Sukeforth often said of
that game, ``I called him over and introduced myself and told him
who sent me. He was amazed. He said, `Why is Mr. Rickey interested
in me?' I told him, `I just work here. I have no authority to
answer that question, but I can assure you there's a lot of
interest in you in Brooklyn.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the time Rickey was forming a Brooklyn Brown Dodgers team to
play in a new black league, but on the morning of Aug. 28,
Sukeforth ushered Robinson into Rickey's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walked, in,'' Sukeforth recalled, ``and I said, `Mr.
Rickey, here is Jack Roosevelt Robinson,' and Rickey said, `Jack,
all my life I've been looking for a great colored ballplayer and I
have reason to believe you might be that man.' That's when Jack
realized Rickey was talking about the Dodgers, not the Brown
Dodgers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sukeforth was the only other person at that meeting as Rickey
told of his plan for Robinson to play in 1946 for the Dodgers' top
farm team in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Rickey told him: `You must be more than a great
ballplayer. I need a man who can accept the worst possible abuse
and take it day after day, a man with the courage not to fight
back.' Jack told him: `Mr. Rickey, I think I can play in Montreal
and I think I can play in Brooklyn. I'll accept your judgment on
that. But if you want to take this gamble, I promise you there will
be no incidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Robinson signed a Montreal contract, becoming
the first black player in what was known as organized baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Six days before the 1947 season opener, the Dodger manager, Leo
Durocher, was suddenly suspended for the entire season by
Commissioner Happy Chandler for controversial off-field incidents.
Rickey named Sukeforth the interim manager. The next day, the
Dodgers purchased Robinson's contract from Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Durocher's ban ``took the heat,'' as Sukeforth said, off
Robinson's debut. ``I didn't tell Jack anything special,''
Sukeforth said. ``Jack had enough to think about.''
</P>
<P>
   After two regular-season games that the Dodgers won, Rickey
hired Burt Shotton as manager. Sukeforth remained a Dodger coach
through 1951 when he was involved in another historic moment. In
the ninth inning of the decisive third game in the National League
pennant playoff at the Polo Grounds, the Giants were rallying
against Don Newcombe.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Dressen, the Dodger manager, phoned Sukeforth in the
bullpen where Ralph Branca and Carl Erskine were warming up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always leaned toward Branca,'' Sukeforth said years later.
``Branca had won 21 games in 1947 when he was 21.'' So Branca was
summoned.
</P>
<P>
   On Branca's second pitch, Bobby Thomson hit the ``shot heard
'round the world,'' a three-run homer for a 5-4 victory and the NL
pennant.
</P>
<P>
   Sukeforth later scouted for the Pittsburgh and Atlanta
franchises; he had been a major league catcher with Cincinnati and
the Dodgers from 1926 to 1934 and again early in the 1945 season.
</P>
<P>
   Sukeforth's first wife, Helen, died in 1938. His second wife,
Grethel, died last year. According to The Associated Press, his
survivors include his daughter, Helen Zimmerman of Dallas, and four
grandchildren.

LAWRENCE FELLOWS, 75, FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT FOR TIMES AND EDITOR
</HEADLINE>
 By   ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   Lawrence Fellows, a former foreign
correspondent for The New York Times and later an editor at local
newspapers in Connecticut, died on Saturday at his home in
Westport, Conn. He was 75.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   Fellows reported for The Times from 1953 to 1978, starting as a
general assignment reporter in Manhattan and as a correspondent at
the United Nations. He went overseas from 1959 to 1972, based
successively in Jerusalem; London; Nairobi, Kenya; and Bonn,
Germany. He then spent six years as The Times' chief correspondent
in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   While working in Nairobi from 1965 to 1969, Fellows traveled
widely and sometimes, as in embattled Sudan, at some risk to
himself. On April 15, 1968, The Times published a long dispatch
from Sudan in which he reported on an untold number of casualties
in a six-year revolt. His article, carried the dateline Juba,
Sudan, and began:
</P>
<P>
   `` `We can never live with the Arabs,''' proclaimed a Sudanese
rebel in a conversation in a crowded, ill-lit room in a town not
far from here, but outside the wild, forested border of the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were half a dozen men in the room, all but one of them
members of the Nilotic tribe, well over 6 feet tall, with
deep-black skins.'' The article described the bitterness among
black Africans over the slave trade and their resentment of the
Arabs of northern Sudan. It was the first article to appear in the
United States press on what happened in the southern Sudan since
the civil strife had begun there.
</P>
<P>
   From 1959 to 1962, Fellows was The Times' correspondent in
Israel, covering the trial of Adolf Eichmann and violence in
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   From 1962 to 1965, he was a Times correspondent in London, where
he covered the scandal surrounding the war minister, John Profumo,
who resigned after lying about his affair with a call girl, and
returned to Cyprus to cover Greek-Turkish fighting. In January
1964, a letter addressed to the editor of The New York Times
arrived in New York. It was from Odysseus Ulysses Tsangarides,
owner of the Olympic Hotel in Nicosia, Cyprus, where Fellows had
been staying. It said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to express my profound gratitude for saving the
life of a good cook and honest man, Costas Niarchou, held as
`prisoner/hostage' by the Turks, thanks to the daring intervention
of your correspondent in Cyprus, Lawrence Fellows, at a dangerous
moment of tension, and who risked his own life trying to save and
liberate the above-mentioned cook.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first that the foreign news desk had heard of
Fellows' feat. Questioned by the desk, he said modestly that he had
merely asked Turkish leaders whether they would try to find out
whether the cook was alive and, if so, whether they could keep him
alive and perhaps even return him. And they did.
</P>
<P>
   But he also told the foreign desk that, with the cook missing,
he had noticed ``a drastic turn for the worse in the food.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1969 to 1972, he was a Times correspondent in Bonn. In
1972, he covered the kidnapping and murder, by Arab terrorists, of
nine Israeli athletes who were in Munich for the Olympic Games
there.
</P>
<P>
   Fellows was born in Detroit, grew up there and in Washington,,
served in the Navy on an aircraft carrier in World War II and
received a bachelor of arts degree in 1948 from Ohio Wesleyan
University. He then worked as a civilian for the U.S. Army in
Berlin and for the State Department in West Germany before joining
The Times in 1953 as a copy boy.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife of 48 years, the former Ruth Bell, he is
survived by two daughters, Eva Fellows of Boca Raton, Fla., and
Robin Fellows of Westport, and three grandchildren.

MARTIN LANG, FORMER NEW YORK CITY COMMISSIONER, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Martin Lang, an engineer and water-pollution expert who was a
New York City commissioner in the Lindsay and Beame
administrations, died Monday at a hospital in Roslyn, N.Y., where
he lived. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Trained as an environmental engineer and chemist, he served the
city for four decades, retiring in 1977 as administrator of the
Department of Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs. His
streetwise, hands-on approach gained him national respect. It also
bolstered the city's reputation as a leader in environmental
management during the 1960s and 1970s, despite technological and
fiscal constraints.
</P>
<P>
   Lang, an ebullient, craggy-faced man, set out in public service
in 1935 and worked in several departments before being put in
charge of the division of sewage disposal in 1964. The following
year he was named director of the Bureau of Water Pollution
Control, a post he held for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Through the 1970s he advanced to commissioner of the Department
of Water Resources, first deputy administrator of the city's
Environmental Protection Administration and commissioner of the
Department of Sanitation. He took the post at Parks and Recreation
in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Working in water resources and sanitation, Lang initiated
studies and long-range programs to adapt water pollution controls
to solid-waste and air-pollution management. He also could be out
before dawn, trailing garbage trucks to see how he might improve
collections.
</P>
<P>
   At parks, he involved the federal Bureau of Outdoor Recreation,
which, he felt, was directing its programs and money to nature
conservancy out West, and little else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Standing with their representatives in front of a handball
court in a so-called ghetto area in Brooklyn,'' he recalled later,
``I finally convinced them that it had greater personal usage than
a backpack trail in the Sierras, was equally worthy of federal
support, and was part of the total environment of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Lang grew up in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. He
entered City College in 1930 at age 15 and graduated as a chemical
engineer in 1935, the year he began working for the city. (He also
earned a master's degree in civil engineering from New York
University in 1954.)
</P>
<P>
   In World War II he was an officer with a sanitation unit in the
Army's engineering corps from 1943 to 1946. After leaving the city
government, he was a private management consultant and for the
World Health Organization and other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Lang's survivors include his wife of 62 years, Bertha Friedman
Lang; two daughters, Judith Zaimont of Edina, Minn., and Doris
Kosloff of Simsbury, Conn.; a son, Robert of Great Neck, N.Y.; and
four grandsons.
</P>
<P>
   Lang's concept of ecology as a whole went beyond acid rain or
fish kills.
</P>
<P>
   ``My simple thesis,'' he told Consulting Engineer magazine in
1978, ``is that man's total environment transcends pure air, food
and water, and must also encompass employment, housing, energy,
transportation and recreation.'' He was referring, he said, ``to
the biomass of people penned up in the megalopolitan confines.''

LUCILLE FLETCHER, 88, AUTHOR OF `SORRY, WRONG NUMBER'
</HEADLINE>
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lucille Fletcher, who transfixed a national audience with her
radio drama ``Sorry, Wrong Number'' on CBS's ``Suspense'' in 1943,
died on Thursday in Langhorne, Pa. She was 88 and lived in Oxford,
Md.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her radio plays, Fletcher was the author of novels,
stage plays and screenplays, but she was best known for ``Sorry,
Wrong Number,'' a 22-minute thriller first broadcast on May 25,
1943.
</P>
<P>
   It concerns Leona Stevenson, a bedridden neurotic who, thanks to
a crossed telephone wire, overhears two men plotting a woman's
murder. After making fruitless calls to the police, she discovers
that the intended victim is herself.
</P>
<P>
   The drama, starring Agnes Moorehead in a virtual monologue with
sound effects, proved so popular that it was broadcast nationally
seven times from 1943 to 1948 and was ultimately translated into 15
languages, including Zulu.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948 Fletcher adapted it for a film that starred Barbara
Stanwyck, whose performance earned an Academy Award nomination.
``Sorry, Wrong Number'' also won an Edgar from the Mystery Writers
of America, inspired two operas and was remade for cable television
in 1989 with Loni Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher's more than 20 radio plays also included
``Hitchhiker,'' an eerie drama about a man who keeps seeing the
same hitchhiker as he drives to California. Orson Welles starred as
the driver, and the haunting score was written by Bernard Herrmann,
Fletcher's first husband, best known for his score for Alfred
Hitchcock's ``Psycho.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s Fletcher began writing novels. ``Blindfold,''
in which a psychoanalyst is virtually kidnapped by the government
to treat a nuclear physicist in such secrecy that he is not allowed
to see his patient or hear any identifiable details of his life,
was made into a 1966 film that starred Rock Hudson and Claudia
Cardinale. Among Fletcher's other novels were ``And Presumed
Dead,'' ``The Strange Blue Yawl,'' ``The Girl in Cabin B54'' and
``Eighty Dollars to Stamford.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1972 Joan Hackett and Len Cariou starred on Broadway in
Fletcher's ``Night Watch,'' about a New York heiress who has
witnessed a murder but cannot prove it. In 1973 it was made into a
film starring Elizabeth Taylor and Laurence Harvey.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher, who was born in Brooklyn in 1912, wanted to be a
writer from childhood. In 1933 she graduated from Vassar College,
where she was a fierce, friendly competitor for literary prizes
with her classmate Mary McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   Employed by CBS in the depths of the Depression, she was a
typist, music librarian and publicity writer. While typing radio
plays, she decided she could master the form.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939 she married Herrmann, with whom she had two daughters.
The marriage ended in divorce in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949 she married John Douglas Wallop III, a novelist whose
``Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant'' was adapted into the 1955
musical ``Damn Yankees.'' He died in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher is survived by two daughters, Dorothy Herrmann, of New
Hope, Pa., and Wendy Harlow of Phoenix, Md.; a sister, Dr. Iris
Norstrand of Brooklyn, and two grandsons.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Washington Post, Fletcher once said:
``Writing suspense stories is like working on a puzzle. You bury
the secret, lead the reader down the path, put in false leads and
throughout the story remain completely logical. Each word must have
meaning and be written in a fine literary style. Mysteries are a
challenge, a double task for the writer, for the reader is aching
to solve the puzzle before you do.'' &QL;

   The U.N. Millennium Summit this week brings to New York City the
largest gathering ever of world leaders to address the most serious
of global afflictions. It is an occasion calling for hope and
perseverance, but most New Yorkers cannot get past the ominous
numbers: 91 scheduled protests, at least 175 motorcades, 245
dignitaries requiring Secret Service and police protection, and 3
days of President Clinton stopping traffic in Manhattan. It is no
wonder many residents welcome the meeting with the same grousing
accorded the West Nile virus, the Atlanta Braves or a ride on the
No. 4 subway line.
</P>
<P>
   If the United Nations were headquartered in Tulsa or Des Moines,
people might line the streets to greet the caravans ferrying
foreign leaders with homemade signs wishing them well in their
fight against illiteracy, AIDS and poverty. Kids would offer the
delegates fresh lemonade, and signs at local high school football
stadiums would read ``Bobcats for Globalization!'' or ``Go Kofi!''
</P>
<P>
   But not in New York. Though the city gains cachet and, by its
own estimate, more than $3 billion a year in economic activity from
housing the U.N., New Yorkers feel no compulsion to be grateful, or
to pay a price, for the honor of being designated as the world's
capital. More than a few residents think New York adds more to the
U.N. than the world organization adds to New York.
</P>
<P>
   But imagine the city without a United Nations. The constant
stream of foreign leaders convening in New York, and their
permanent representatives there, help to transform the city from
mere financial center to world capital. Images of Nikita Khrushchev
pounding the desk with his shoe and of countless other world
leaders from Fidel Castro to Nelson Mandela addressing the General
Assembly are an indelible part of the city's history. In contrast
to some cases of town-gown friction, New York's U.N. campus is a
fitting mirror of the city's own history as a mixing point of
cultures and aspirations. It is as much a monument to New York's
heritage as Ellis Island is.
</P>
<P>
   Though New York is the perfect home for the United Nations, it
did not have a lock on being chosen. Certainly if the U.N. were
created today, it would more likely be based in Geneva or The
Hague. Only in the immediate aftermath of World War II could a
majority of nations have accepted the notion of the world's
diplomatic forum being established in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Even among American cities, New York was not the initial
front-runner for the U.N.'s permanent home. The American
foreign-policy elite considered San Francisco, site of the
organization's founding convention in 1945, the most desirable
candidate, providing a more idyllic setting and a less Euro-centric
perspective than New York or Washington. Though the U.N. had made
New York its temporary home in the fall of 1946, Boston and
Philadelphia were deemed stronger East Coast contenders.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, New York City's mayor at the time, William
O'Dwyer, felt that getting the U.N. to stay for good was ``the one
great thing that would make New York the center of the world,'' but
he had little to offer in the way of choice real estate or cash.
</P>
<P>
   The solution came from Robert Moses, William Zeckendorf and
Nelson Rockefeller. The three New Yorkers worked frantically in the
week before the U.N.'s final headquarters decision, in December
1946, to cobble together a deal whereby John D. Rockefeller Jr.,
Nelson's father, would pay Zeckendorf $8.5 million for a plot of
land on once-blighted Turtle Bay on Midtown Manhattan's East Side
and the Rockefellers would then turn it over to the U.N. Moses, the
longtime public servant who headed a blue-ribbon committee to keep
the U.N. in New York, was able to secure some other goodies from
the city and state. The rest, as they say, is Midtown congestion,
and a shining spot in the diplomatic firmament.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Sept. 6:
</P>
<P>
   To some ears, the Northwest Passage still sounds like an
old-fashioned geographic fiction, an article of faith for which men
died rather than a real path through real waters. Victorian England
never showed its true colors more truly than in its fervent
response to the disappearance of Sir John Franklin's last Arctic
expedition, which sailed from England on May 18, 1845, in search of
the Northwest Passage, and whose fate remained essentially unknown
for a dozen years afterward. Rescue missions were staged, poems
written, funds raised, theories proposed and contested. The very
duration of uncertainty about Franklin became an element of the
region in which he and his crew perished.
</P>
<P>
   All this makes the recent voyage of the St. Roch II, a Royal
Canadian Mounted Police boat, the more remarkable. It traversed the
Northwest Passage in a month without running into any ice.
Moreover, it was one of at least three vessels to cruise the
Northwest Passage this summer. On its voyage, the St. Roch II also
came across the bodies of six of Franklin's crew _ bodies found
with the aid of an Inuk hunter who was relying on old tribal
stories.
</P>
<P>
   There is an almost bewildering convergence of time scales here.
The alarm at Franklin's silence was not seriously sounded until
more than a year after he sailed, simply because there was no way
that news of his fate, good or bad, could have returned to England
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Ken Burton, the skipper of the St. Roch II, relied on
maritime telephone for instantaneous communication. Louie Kamookak,
the Inuk hunter, depended on ancestral lore reaching back more than
a century and a half.
</P>
<P>
   The voyage of the St. Roch II raised the possibility of a
northwestern thoroughfare for seagoing traffic, the very thing
first sought by John Cabot half a millennium ago. What unsettled
earlier ages was the thought of a frozen North, capable of
defeating the will even of men as energetic and resourceful as Sir
John Franklin. What unsettles us is the thought of an ice-free
passage through an unfrozen North, a world whose ecological
delicacy has been protected through the centuries mainly by its
inaccessibility.

EDITORIAL: FIRST, THREE BIG DEBATES  
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Sept. 6: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No events in a presidential campaign are more crucial to public
involvement in the electoral process than the cycle of debates
involving the major candidates in the fall. This week, however,
Gov. George W. Bush is demanding that instead of three televised
encounters sponsored by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential
Debates that has run the events since 1988, he wants only one such
debate coupled with two other joint appearances with Vice President
Al Gore, one on ``Meet the Press'' and the other on ``Larry King
Live.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with Bush's demand is that it needlessly junks a
system that has been fair to both Republicans and Democrats, and it
could greatly reduce the number of viewers likely to tune in.
Bush's search for a safer debate environment also looks like a
tactical loser for him, since it undercuts his declaration that he
is ready for leadership in any and all circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides say he is pressing his proposal because he does not
like the formats from previous elections, particularly the formal
appearance of two candidates at lecterns. The Bush campaign argues
that this setup and the looser ``town meeting'' format both play to
Gore's strengths and that Bush would prefer sitting down at a table
in a conversation between the two candidates and a respected
moderator. But the presidential debate commission has said it would
be amenable to discussions on format once everyone agrees to
participate in the debates themselves. There is no reason the
candidates cannot agree to have King or Tim Russert of NBC's ``Meet
the Press'' moderate one of the commission's three debates, as Bush
wants.
</P>
<P>
   Any news organization has the right to offer the candidates a
chance to debate, and the more debates the better. But the
candidates and the national party leaders have an obligation to see
that the commission debates are nailed down before any others are
added to the schedule. This flows from the fact that the
presidential debate commission was established jointly by
Republican and Democratic leaders in 1987. Its honorary chairmen
are Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, and the commission
has been resolutely bipartisan in its approach. One of its goals
was to avoid candidates' backing out of debates over scheduling
conflicts and to help networks minimize similar conflicts with
their own fall programs.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, the 90-minute debates have drawn from 50 million
to 97 million viewers. Television experts say that a 60-minute
debate on only one network, which Bush wants, would probably not
draw more than 20 million viewers in prime time. That is too small
a number for the debates to fulfill their historic purpose. Picking
a single network, as Bush proposes, also opens the door for the
kind of broadcast turf wars that the commission has been able to
avoid.
</P>
<P>
   There is room, however, to indulge some of Bush's frivolous
demands. If he continues to be uneasy about holding the first
debate at a site near the John F. Kennedy Library in Massachusetts,
Gore should agree to meet his opponent at a facility named for a
Republican. As for the format issue, the ideal solution would be
for Bush and Gore to be allowed one format of their own choosing,
and some sort of compromise on the third debate. But again, we
would urge the Gore campaign toward maximum flexibility in making
Bush comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Where Gore should take a firm line, though, is in continuing to
insist that Bush agree to the three commission debates with
``roadblock,'' or all-network, coverage. When those debates are
set, then the candidates can do any number of additional debates on
King's or Russert's show or anyplace else, for that matter. The
public is served by more debates, not fewer _ and by preservation
of the primacy of the Commission on Presidential Debates.

ANGELS SIGN 16-YEAR-OLD DOMINICAN PITCHER
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The Anaheim Angels announced on Tuesday they have
signed 16-year-old pitcher Johan Quezada Santana from the Dominican
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Santana, who is 6-foot-2, 150 pounds, worked out at Edison Field
in recent weeks and was an option for the club if it could not sign
pitcher Chris Bootcheck, a first-round draft pick in June.
</P>
<P>
   Bootcheck's agent, Scott Boras, and the Angels have not been
able to agree on a signing bonus. The Angels offer was believed to
be raised to $1.7 million recently but not accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Signing Santana to a substantial contract, approximately
$600,000 to $700,000, seems to indicate the Angels have gone in
another direction with Bootcheck, leaving him to remain in college
for his senio Bootcheck was the 20th overall pick in the draft, but
the Angels' second selection behind 17-year-old pitcher Joe Torres,
who was taken with the 10th overall pick and received a $2.1
million signing __ Back at you: The Angels didn't want
knuckleballer Steve Sparks after last season. Now pitching for the
Tigers, Sparks was named the American League pitcher of the month
for August. Sparks, who will start tonight against the Angels, has
won six in a row, includ record with a 1.69 ERA in August.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks says he has no bitter feelings toward the Angels. After
all, he went 5-11 with 5.42 ERA last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understood the situation, they had (Brian) Cooper, (Jarrod)
Washburn, (Ramon) Ortiz and (Matt) Wise. They were bringing back
Tim Belcher and Ken Hill. I read the writing on the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Erstad in the outfield: Darin Erstad started in left field
for the first time since Aug. 19. He had been limited to the DH
spot because of a strained muscle in his rib cage.
</P>
<P>
   He had two hits Tuesday to extend his hitting streak to 11
games.
</P>
<P>
   __ Health check: Pitchers Seth Etherton and Washburn each threw
three innings of a simulated game Tuesday, but there is for them to
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we are not ruling out them pitching again this year,
the chances are remote because of the time left,'' Scioscia said.
``In no way are we going to let the needs of a team in the pennant
race jeopardize the health of these two young arms.''

YOUNG ANGELS ARMS HIT THE SKIDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT Anaheim Angels manager Mike Scioscia hasn't wavered in
showing confidence in his young starting pitchers since the first
day of spring training. They lived up to his expectations and
exceeded those of others most of the season. But now, at the most
critical point of the season, they have hit the wall.
</P>
<P>
   And the rest of the team is going down right along with them.
The Angels lost their season-worst sixth consecutive game 7-5
Tuesday night to the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park.
</P>
<P>
   They fell seven games behind the first-place Seattle Mariners in
the American League West with 24 games remaining. They also fell 7
games behind the Cleveland Indians in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   The recent slump has been the result of poor starting pitching.
No Angels starter has won since Matt Wise beat the Indians on Aug.
25, a stretch of 10 games. In those games, the starters are 0-6
with an 11.10 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was Wise's turn and he had what he called his worst
performance of the season, including his first four months at
Triple-A Edmonton. Wise (3-3) gave up seven runs and seven hits and
2 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some growing pains,'' Scioscia said. ``You have to
look at it as having growing pains at an inopportune time. But
these guys are the best we have to offer right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Clark hit a two-run homer in the second inning off Wise,
who allowed five more runs in the third without making it out of
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The relievers _ Juan Alvarez, Lou Pote, Bryan Ward, Ben Weber
and Mark Petkovsek _ pitched well go give the Angels a chance. They
combined to throw 5 scoreless innings, giving up only three hits.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got an RBI single from Tim Salmon in the first and a
two-run triple from Scott Spiezio in the sixth off Tigers starter
Brian Moehler (12-7), but it wasn't enough to offset another large
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew coming into the situation our pitching staff was going
to take us as far as we could go,'' said Angels first baseman Mo
Vaughn, who went 0 for 5 with four strikeouts. ``Even though they
are young, that's the way it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew what we got into from the beginning, you learn on the
job whether you're young or a guy like me, when you have a night
like I did tonight. You only get better with failing.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn emphasized he wasn't blaming the starters for the Angels'
plight. ``I am not pointing any fingers for any situation,'' Vaughn
said. ``We are a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the losing streak, Scioscia says there is no point in
shaking things up. ``If I didn't see the effort, or heart, or
passion to play the game, you'd see some lockers turned over right
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (coaching) staff would not put up with that, but we
haven't seen that. They are playing with a passion every day. They
live and die with every pitch. In my mind, the solution isn't
anything but having patience and getting productive starting
pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Wise put together four good starts when he first joined the
rotation, but he has struggled in his past two.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not from a lack of confidence or focus,'' Wise said.
``It's just a lack of execution.''

VETERAN STANLEY SHOWS VALUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Mike Stanley went a career-best 5 for 5 _ a home run, a
double, three singles _ with 5 RBIs Monday in Oakland's 10-0 rout
of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   That's just two hits fewer than the struggling Red Sox had in
their 5-1 Labor Day win over Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Why can't the Sox get a player like that?
</P>
<P>
   Things are good these days for Stanley, who finds himself again
in the thick of a playoff hunt just a little more than a month
after the Red Sox gave him his walking papers.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley returned to Fenway Park Tuesday &UR;  &LR; night, in the starting
lineup at first base, and batting cleanup. His return attracted a
horde of media, eager to hear his thoughts on his past with the Sox
and his future with the Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first questions, of course, was whether the Red Sox
did the right thing in letting him go. Then he was asked about
being placed on the disabled list and his ex-teammates coming to
his support, Jeff Frye in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he said, ``the (Red Sox) have a lot of players
here. Maybe they're better off without Mike Stanley. It's hard to
say. I'm not here to judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disabled list? It was frustrating, because when I finally
signed with this team, it was, I think, a month and two or three
days since my last at-bat. It was tough, but at the time I
understood why Jimy (Williams) wanted to do what he wanted to do.
It just came down to a time when I felt like I needed to be
released and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   When Stanley finally was let go, more than one of his mates were
candid in their criticism of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt great to know I had that kind of respect in the
clubhouse with teammates,'' said Stanley. ``That's ultimately the
family, a group of players. It's not necessarily the front office
or even the coaches. The players have such a unique bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice that some of those guys stepped up. Some of the
bigger names. Nomar (Garciaparra) said some nice things. It just
made me feel good to know that I had that respect from the players
I played with.''
</P>
<P>
   Most outspoken was Frye, who just days after his tirade was
traded to Colorado. Stanley said he has talked with Frye several
times since then. He joked, ``It's hard to say Jeff was punished in
any way. He went to one of the best hitting places in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Since signing with Oakland Aug. 4, Stanley is 25 for 86 (.291)
with three homers and 16 RBIs in 26 games. Tuesday &UR;  &LR; night, he
provided a sixth-inning RBI double, a rare Oakland highlight in a
10-3 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't think I could still do the job, I wouldn't have
signed,'' said Stanley. ``I was having a great time with my kids.
It was a great period of time during the summer. But I felt I still
had something to offer the game and hopefully offer a team that was
in contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way (Oakland) looks at it, we're very much in contention
in the West. We're actually in better position there than we are in
the wild card. That's what we focus our attention on, just as I'm
sure the (Red Sox) are focusing their attention on New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley brings to the Oakland clubhouse the same kind of
influence he had in Boston. He was greeted there with open arms.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran second baseman Randy Velarde called Stanley a huge
addition to the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a veteran, a righthanded bat, and balances our lineup,''
said Velarde. ``He gives a little protection to Jason Giambi. To
get a quality addition like Stano is big for us. He brings playoff
experience and that's invaluable. I just can't say enough good
things about the guy. He's a presence in this clubhouse, especially
with all the youngsters we have on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those youngsters is 24-year-old right fielder Adam Piatt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has seen just about everything at one time or another,''
said Piatt. ``He's a swell guy to have in the locker room. He's a
guy you can go up to and ask advice and know you're going to get a
quality answer and he's going to be genuine with you. He fit right
in. We're glad he's here. I know he's going to help us out.''

SCHOUREK PITCHES IN FOR RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-SCHOUREK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Pete Schourek knows the elbow surgery is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The shoulder? Perhaps, but not definite.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the Red Sox lefthander intends to take his turn
on the mound every fifth day and hope for the best. The pain will
return, doctors have told him, but Schourek hopes it's not until
November.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek, saying that ``things are better, but not 100
percent,'' gave the Red Sox a huge boost Tuesday &UR;  &LR; night at Fenway
Park, where he pitched a strong 5 1/3 innings of two-hit ball in a
10-3 win over Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   It was his first appearance since coming off the 15-day disabled
list Saturday and ended a string of 12 starts without a win (0-6,
six no-decisions). It was a far cry from his last start July 20 at
Baltimore: 2 1/3 innings, 5 hits, 5 runs, 5 walks.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek, who threw 74 pitches, 48 for strikes, conceded he
could have packed it in for the season, knowing what lies ahead,
but he was reluctant to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a mixed decision,'' said Schourek (3-9, 5.05
ERA). ``I'm going to have to have surgery eventually this year.
Talking to the doctors, they said that I would be able to rehab it
and be ready for spring training if I was able to finish out the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a matter of what kind of stuff I could come back
with. I'm happy with my stuff today and I'm just going to take it .
. . start to start and see how it goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to change anything on the mound. I'm going to
throw as hard as I can for as long as I can during the game. If I
can't do it anymore, if I'm not effective anymore, than maybe it's
time to take care of it. But until that time, I'm going to try to
do what I did tonight every fifth day.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Giambi was the biggest thorn in Schourek's side. The
Oakland designated hitter reached on an error in the first inning,
then in the fourth drilled a one-out home run to right, the first
hit off Schourek. He also singled off Schourek in the sixth,
bringing Jimy Williams out of the dugout and reliever Hipolito
Pichardo into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really pitched good,'' said Williams of Schourek. ``He had
a good breaking ball and was on the plate. He really gave us a big
boost with that kind of performance out there. He really did.''
</P>
<P>
   Schourek, whose winless streak was the longest for a Boston
pitcher since Mike Gardiner's dirty dozen in 1992, got the jump on
most of the 21 batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's key for me, getting ahead,'' he said. ``I don't throw
real hard so I have to get ahead and get the count in my favor so I
can manipulate the strike zone the way I need to.''
</P>
<P>
   Schourek said he loves pitching in September, when every outing
means something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to have more chips on the line,'' he said. ``I would
love to be able to do that throughout the whole season one time.
It's just when the weather gets cool, there's a little more bounce
in your step when there's a playoff race and the intensity level is
higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Schourek acknowledged that Tuesday &UR;  &LR; night's effort surprised him
somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, kind of,'' he said. ``I was pretty down after that last
start in Baltimore. I didn't think I'd be able to get back to
having this kind of stuff right now. I was just working hard and
maybe the rest helped out some more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor told me it's just a matter of time before (the
pain) all comes back. I just hopes it's in early November.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, do the Red Sox, who right now can use all the pitching
help they can get.

CONE HURT IN YANKS WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ After a doctor struggled to shove David
Cone's left, nonthrowing shoulder back into place Tuesday night,
Cone stifled the inevitable sadness over his latest setback and
mustered some levity. ``I guess this makes your decision about the
post-season roster a lot easier,'' he joked to Yankees manager Joe
Torre, while sitting on the trainer's table.
</P>
<P>
   Despite dislocating his shoulder while making a diving catch in
the third inning, there is a chance that Cone could come back in
the last two weeks of the season. He could start a game or two and
make a last bid to participate in the playoffs, at the end of his
sixth and perhaps final year with the Yankees. If that does not
happen, Cone will feel as if this is a fitting end to a horrible
season.
</P>
<P>
   When Cone was helped off the field in agony, the gate to the
visitors' bullpen in left field swung open and Dwight Gooden jogged
across the outfield here to relieve his longtime teammate, to help
his own chances of being on the post-season roster. Gooden threw 5
1/3 innings and collected his 194th career victory as the Yankees
dumped Kansas City, 10-5. Clay Bellinger, David Justice and Scott
Brosius each slugged home runs among 17 hits for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Cone walked into the clubhouse after the game shirtless, without
any wrapping whatsoever on his left shoulder. But as he pulled on
an olive-colored shirt, the trainer Gene Monahan stepped through a
throng of reporters. ``Let me put this on first,'' Monahan said,
holding a sling.
</P>
<P>
   Cone raised both hands to his chest as Monahan eased the sling
over his left elbow, then buttoned his shirt. Cone, who will have
an MRI exam Wednesday morning, spoke hopefully of a return this
season, reporting what he was told, that there does not seem to be
any additional damage. He keeps his hands below his shoulders in
his pitching motion; maybe it would just be a question of how much
pain he could stand, or whether he could raise his left arm quickly
enough to protect himself.
</P>
<P>
   Cone also mentioned other possibilities, that he would not pitch
again this year. ``I definitely do not want my career to end this
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching in the third inning against his former team, in his
hometown, Cone rushed off the mound in pursuit of a bunt popped up
by the Kansas City shortstop Rey Sanchez; moving toward third base,
Cone extended his left-handed glove and dove, parallel to the
ground. He caught the ball in midair _ and landed heavily on his
left elbow. Cone immediately rolled over in pain, writhing, his
left arm prone at his side, panicked, realizing his shoulder was
out of its socket, yelling at Monahan to not touch him. ``It felt
like my shoulder was in my neck,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cone's body slumped toward his left side, in the direction of
the damaged shoulder, as Monahan quickly helped him to his feet and
off the field, Cone's body slumped toward his left side. Royals
fans, who cheered for Cone when he broke into the majors in 1986,
and again in 1993 and 1994 after he signed with Kansas City as a
free agent, clapped in support of Cone as he departed. His father
and mother, Ed and Joan Cone, watched from the stands before
heading for the Yankees' clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Joyce, the Royals' team doctor, worked for 15 minutes to
maneuver Cone's shoulder back into place; Joyce was having so much
trouble that at one point, there was talk of moving Cone to the
hospital for the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Cone was eventually taken to a local hospital for X-rays, which
revealed no fractures, and his teammates were surprised to see him
moving his left hand and arm after the game. ``I feel like I dodged
a bullet,'' Cone said. ``Judging by how I feel now, I feel pretty
lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury comes at a time when the 37-year-old Cone seemed to
be rebounding, in the last weeks of what has been a frustrating
year. Cone,4-11 with a 6.16 earned run average overall, had no
victories for more than three months, his record 1-10 after the
Minnesota Twins pounded him for nine hits and eight runs in five
innings on July 27. Cone went to the Yankees' minor league facility
in Tampa, Fla., on the orders of the Yankees' owner George
Steinbrenner, worked on his mechanics and regained some confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Cone ended his streak without a victory Aug. 10, and in his five
outings leading up to tonight's game against the Royals last night,
Cone was 3-1 with a 3.86 ERA, contributing to the Yankees' recent
surge in the American League East standings.
</P>
<P>
   With the Yankees closing in on their third consecutive division
title and their sixth straight appearance in the post-season, it
appears as if Cone will not be part of the post-season rotation,
regardless of the condition of his shoulder and how it impacts what
he does. Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte, Orlando Hernandez and Denny
Neagle are likely to make up the Yankees' rotation in October.

ALEXANDER'S SHOT A TOUGH ONE TO CALL 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-ALEXANDER-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As it usually is when they talk, the next conversation
between great friends Manny Alexander and Sammy Sosa will revolve
around home runs. This time, however, they will be discussing
Alexander's first career grand slam, a first-inning shot
Tuesday &UR;  &LR; night that pretty much settled matters early between the
Red Sox and Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it could be a one-sided phone call because Sosa could
be left speechless by the shock of the news. So stunning was
Alexander's blast into the net that staked Pete Schourek to a 7-0
lead en route to a 10-3 win that the hero himself couldn't hide a
smile that had a shade of embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, I'm not a home run hitter,'' said the utility
infielder who manned third base in place of the injured Lou
Merloni. ``But (Sosa) better call me, because I do it all the time
when he does it.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the home run came from the most unlikely of
candidates. Alexander is, after all, the guy who back on July 4
ended a homerless streak of 371 at-bats _ fourth longest for
non-pitchers among active players _ with his first home run of the
season. He hit another in August, so he's now got three homers in
three months _ and 14 in 1,178 major league at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander's slugging percentage (.298) could never have forecast
what was in store as he came up in the first inning, the ninth
hitter to face beleaguered Oakland starter Kevin Appier. The
righthander had already yielded four hits and three walks, but with
Alexander up, there seemingly was no cause for alarm, so the
bullpen was silent.
</P>
<P>
   Two pitches later, Fenway was anything but, Alexander having
delivered an 0-and-1 pitch just inside the foul pole down the
left-field line to put the A's down by a touchdown and an extra
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good pitch,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A good pitch? Alexander was told that Appier had described it as
hanging slider that he didn't have a good grip on.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander smiled. The pitcher had his definition of what a good
pitch looks like, Alexander has his. And that hanging slider that
moved out over the the middle of the plate sure looked good to a
guy unaccustomed to the power role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a power hitter,'' said Alexander, who has fewer hits
(36) this year than Sosa has home runs (45). ``But sometimes you
hit the ball in the real good part of the bat and you have a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he wasn't sure it would clear the wall, ``but I made
good contact and you have to be happy when you do things like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Most important, said Alexander, was the fact that the power
surge came in a crucial game in a September pennant race. It would
send him to the phones happy, for calls to his wife (she just
returned to the Dominican) and to his mother (visiting his younger
brother Enrique, who plays high school ball in New York).
</P>
<P>
   From a personal standpoint, it was also nice that first base
coach Tommy Harper somehow managed to retrieve the ball and deliver
it to Alexander, who said he'd like Appier to autograph it.
</P>
<P>
   Does he think the guy whose pitching line included nine hits and
eight runs in just 2 2/3 innings would actually want to do such a
thing?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I do,'' said Alexander. ``He's a nice guy. I think he'll
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he will. But Appier will probably still wonder how it ever
happened.

ANOTHER DODGERS FIASCO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Erratic and mostly abysmal performances couldn't
keep lefty Carlos Perez out of the Los Angeles Dodgers starting
rotation. His health, though, might end his season.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, given a multitude of opportunities the past two seasons
for millions upon millions of reasons (i.e., dollars), was bashed
around by Pittsburgh before leaving his start Tuesday with a
shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   Perez's outing was the low point of an embarrassing 8-0,
three-error loss to Pittsburgh in front of a season-low 22,780 at
Dodger Stadium. In the first two games of the series, the Dodgers
have been outscored by the Pirates 20-1.
</P>
<P>
   They've also been shut down by two pitchers who had similar
numbers to Perez. Jimmy Anderson pitched a complete game Monday and
right-hander Jose Silva (9-9) further frustrated the Dodgers on
Tuesday. Silva was 1-5 with a 13.50 ERA in August and allowed eight
runs in 3 innings in his last start.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers managed just five hits in seven innings against
Silva, who pitched at least six innings for the first time since
July 26. After Tom Goodwin led off the bottom of the first with a
single, Silva retired the next 11 batters and 14 of 15.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, though, is Perez's shoulder. He had trouble with it
in his start in Milwaukee, during which he failed to record an out
in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning of the game, it was kind of stiff,'' said
Perez, who's guaranteed $7.5 million next season. ``The last pitch
I threw I felt something pop in the back of my shoulder. I was
trying to push myself and stay in the rotation. I want to help my
team, like always. Right now, my arm doesn't feel so good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough pitching when you feel pain in your arm.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial diagnosis is mild strain of the left rotator cuff.
His status for his next start, which was slated for Monday in
Arizona, was uncertain. In part, because of his health. But the
same questions that led to his being sent to the minors last July
still exist.
</P>
<P>
   Perez will be re-examined today, but Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said it's unlikely he'd make his next start. Instead, the
Dodgers might turn to either Luke Prokopec of recall right-hander
Eric Gagne from Albuquerque, which is in the Triple-A playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's out indefinitely,'' Johnson said. ``He felt it pretty bad
in the game so we'll have to see. I'm sure he's going to have an
MRI. I'm sure he's not going to be able to start in five or six
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez exited with an injury and an enormous deficit. He allowed
six runs on 10 hits in 3 innings before suffering the injury on a
two-out pitch to Brian Giles in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   If injury didn't knock Perez out, the Pirates would likely have
done so shortly thereafter. Perez, whose ERA is 5.56, was touched
for three runs in the first inning and allowed eight hits before he
recorded his fourth out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just kills you,'' Johnson said. ``They had eight hits in
the first two innings. You escape with just four runs. It's
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Perez threw well in nonpressure situations out of the
bullpen, his return to the rotation has been anything but glorious.
He earned the win Aug. 25 against Chicago but was lambasted for six
runs in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Perez's exit marked the seventh time in 22 starts he's failed to
pitch at least five innings. In his past five starts, Perez had
made it into the fifth inning once. During that time, he's 1-4 with
an 11.37 ERA. In his past two starts he has a 15.88 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't playing well,'' Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros
said. ``The last two nights we haven't done much offensively, if
anything. We've just really struggled.''

HINGIS, VENUS WILLIAMS GAIN SEMIFINALS 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was deja vu all over again. All over the place.
</P>
<P>
   First, Martina Hingis and Venus Williams won their quarterfinal
matches to set up a Friday rematch of last year's US Open
semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis roared out to a quick start and held off a Monica Seles
comeback for a 6-0, 7-5 win Tuesday &UR;  &LR; night. Earlier in the day,
Williams had all kinds of problems in outlasting Nathalie Tauziat,
6-4, 1-6, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Todd Martin, expressive and excited, did the women one
better.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Martin lost the first two sets of his fourth-round
match against Greg Rusedski and turned it around, winning the match
and then going all the way to the final, where he lost to Andre
Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday &UR;  &LR; night, Martin squandered chances early and lost a pair
of 66-minute tiebreaker sets to get Carlos Moya right where he
wanted him.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, unseeded here after a tough season, battled back to beat
Moya, 6-7 (7-3), 6-7 (9-7), 6-1, 7-6 (8-6), 6-2, in a match that
took 4 hours 15 minutes and ended at 1:19 in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fine, I feel great,'' a breathless Martin told a
television audience before he left the court. ``I feel terrible,
but I feel great. It was awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin broke Moya early to run away with the third set. Then he
put on a show in the fourth. He had a couple of break points to win
the set but let them slip away, and it went to another tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was up, 5-3, in the tiebreaker. Moya won three straight
points to get to match point on his serve at 6-5. Martin got out of
that one with a volley to set up an overhead. A service winner and
crosscourt forehand winner and they were headed to a fifth set.
</P>
<P>
   Again Martin broke Moya twice early and then, the guy who has
been known to have trouble closing out matches, closed it out.
</P>
<P>
   Moya's last forehand popped wide and Martin turned to watch it,
smashing his racket on the court and celebrating with the fans who
had stayed.
</P>
<P>
   Martin meets Thomas Johansson, ranked No. 91 in the world.
Johansson ousted qualifier Wayne Arthurs, 6-4, 6-7 (9-7), 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   No. 3 seed Magnus Norman, who barely survived his previous
match, was ousted by No. 14 seed Nicolas Kiefer, 6-2, 6-7 (7-3),
6-1, 6-3. Kiefer plays No. 6 Marat Safin, who routed Juan Carlos
Ferrero, 6-1, 6-2, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis won last year's semifinal match over Venus Williams in
three sets, but then lost to Serena Williams in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis was all over Seles in the first set Tuesday, getting 24
of the 30 points in the set and putting it away in 13 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really started off the match sluggishly,'' Seles said. ``I
tried to get back in it, but it was way too late. Maybe I panicked
a little and against Martina, you're not going to get any free
points.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles had her serve broken and was down, 3-1, in the second set,
but then climbed back into the match. Hingis served for the match
at 5-4 and held off five break points before Seles evened it up at
5-5.
</P>
<P>
   Seles served at 6-5 to force a tiebreaker, but Hingis broke for
the match.
</P>
<P>
   Now she'll get ready for Venus Williams, who beat Hingis in
three sets at Wimbledon on the way to the title.
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams even had problems finding a seat against Tauziat.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was broken in the third set and Tauziat had a little
life at 1-4. Williams headed to the side of the court for the
changeover, went to sit down . . . and missed her chair. Bottomed
out.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of day on the court for Williams. Even after
putting Tauziat away for a spot in the semis for the third year in
a row, Williams had a hard time feeling good about the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had quit playing tennis like that,'' Williams
said. ``But once again . . . It's been a little while since I
played a match like that. I can't accept these type of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Can't accept the 10 double faults and the 31 unforced errors (to
2 and 21 of Tauziat). Can't accept the inconsistency. Can't accept
the lost second set when Tauziat broke her the first two times she
served, by far the worst set she's played in some time, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the fact that she won her 24th consecutive match took
a little of the sting out of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never get upset when I'm playing,'' Williams said. ``But
today I was. It was very strange.''
</P>
<P>
   And the chair episode?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just angry,'' she said. ``I just couldn't see.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying hard not to stomp my feet, swing my racquet
around,'' Williams said. ``Some players show a lot of emotion, but
usually I don't. I'm pretty calm and collected, moving on to the
next point. That was maybe the main battle for me, why I didn't
play well also. I was too busy thinking about the points before,
not focusing ahead.''

<P>
   Disease-causing organisms have been known to travel quickly in
closed environments. The March issue of the British Medical Journal
offered insight into just how fast they can spread.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Nottingham in England monitored
freshmen for Neisseria meningitidis. They weren't looking for
students who were infected and sick, but just for students who
carried the bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of school, about 7 percent of the class carried
the bacteria. By the second day, the rate was up to 11 percent, and
up to 19 percent on the third day.
</P>
<P>

   PATALON, Philippines _ Joel Quino knows what it's like to walk
the plank.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sunny March afternoon, and he was fishing in a small
dinghy, a mile and half offshore from this village in the southern
Philippines. Suddenly, two masked men wielding M-1 rifles sped up
alongside in a motorized canoe and shouted, ``Ambak pare!''_ ``Jump
overboard, pal!''
</P>
<P>
   He obeyed, and in a matter of seconds, the pirates stole his
entire life savings and his means of livelihood _ a tiny boat with
an outboard engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I going to drown,'' said Quino, 34, who was rescued
by a passing fisherman. But his problems had just begun.
</P>
<P>
   In this village of 200 subsistence fishermen and their families,
he is one of 50 victims who have lost their boats or engines to
small-time but heavily armed pirates. Every penny of the
fishermen's earnings had gone into their tiny boats, and with an
average income of $77 a month, not one believes he will ever save
$700 to buy a new boat, engine, and nets. They now borrow dinghies
from their luckier neighbors and split the catch with them 50-50.
</P>
<P>
   Victims of modern piracy come in all stripes _ from poor
fishermen who lose their livelihoods, to shipping tycoons who have
to write off multimillion-dollar tankers, to yachtsmen whose
vacations turn into nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy-eight seafarers were killed by pirates in 1998, most
of them in Asian waters,'' said Corey Bousen, publisher of Lloyd's
List Maritime Asia, a trade journal. ``If 78 Americans were
murdered on a bus in downtown Boston, you'd hear about it for 10
years. But because these killings are at sea, and most victims are
from third-world countries, nobody takes notice.''
</P>
<P>
   The maritime industry has started to mobilize, however.
Shipowners are debating the merits of hiring former soldiers to
escort or recover their ships, and some have installed hidden
tracking devices to monitor vessels if they are seajacked. Crews
are urged to keep fire hoses ready to ward off attackers, and post
sailors on round-the-clock watches on floodlit decks.
</P>
<P>
   Some captains now avoid the most dangerous waters of Indonesia
and Malaysia and the coasts of Bangladesh and Somalia. Yachtsmen
have begun to sail in convoys and skip some deserted ``paradise
isles.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Severns, a Maui-based underwater photographer and biologist
who used to lead yacht trips to remote islands, still feels a chill
when he recalls a horrifying Indonesian holiday two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He and six friends had anchored their 90-foot ironwood boat off
the island of Salajar, by the southern tip of western Sulawesi.
``We had just finished dinner,'' Severns recounted, ``and before we
knew what happened, we turned around, and instead of the crew, we
saw 12 men with handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the horror of piracy. You're in the middle of nowhere,
no one knows where you are, and there's no place to run. They could
have shot us, ransacked the boat and sunk it, and no one would have
known.''
</P>
<P>
   Severns talked his way out of the situation, addressing the men
as if they were maritime police conducting a search, and telling
them he worked for the national airline's flight magazine, which
seemed to impress them. ``I guess they figured robbing us could
bring a problem, and we weren't worth their while.'' But that was
far from the end of his adventures.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, off the northern tip of Babar Island, 200
miles east of East Timor, he and five friends were doing a night
scuba dive when they were surrounded by canoes filled with
screaming attackers. Severns, the divers' guide, and the captain of
their boat were taken ashore, where the guide and the captain were
beaten nearly unconscious, while the others escaped back to the
boat.
</P>
<P>
   The attackers had heard that ``tourists are rich, and they
thought we'd have thousands of dollars lying around on deck,''
Severns said.
</P>
<P>
   Although his jaw was broken, the captain managed to escape and
swimback to the yacht. ``The last thing he saw was mobs attacking
us, and he gave the order to cut the anchor line and go to sea.
They heard cheering like a rugby match, and they thought we were
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The yacht's mayday signal was picked up by a woman who relayed
their call for help.
</P>
<P>
   Ashore, Severns and his guide were being held by the village
chief, who wanted a ransom of 220 pounds of rice and 110 pounds of
pork. A few hours later, soldiers burst into the village hall and
rescued them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Asian economic crisis has made people desperate,'' Severns
said. ``After my two experiences, I'm pretty much trying to stick
to main islands.''
</P>
<P>
   Alternate routes aren't an option, though, for coastal fishermen
on whom piracy has taken its greatest toll. Most attacks are never
reported, out of ignorance or fear of revenge by pirates they will
see again.
</P>
<P>
   Shipmaster Rudy Gabayron, 45, has worked aboard mid-sized
Philippine fishing trawlers for 20 years, and says he cannot count
the number of times his boats have been fired upon by men in
motorized canoes demanding fish.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Navy started arming civilian guards to ride on coastal
trawlers in 1989, attacks have decreased, Gabayron said.
</P>
<P>
   But around 11 one night last October, while their guard was on
leave, five motorboats carrying 20 men surrounded the May I off
Lanhill Island, southeast of Zamboanga City, and fired shots as two
pirates jumped aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Gabayron and four others were shot in the chaos, and the pirates
carted off the ship's sonar, its radio, and crew belongings _
$11,000 worth of goods.
</P>
<P>
   In the half-light of a fluorescent bulb in the dingy,
hospital-green cabin, he lifted his shirt to reveal his bullet
wounds, and admitted he was traumatized: ``My family told me not to
keep fishing, but I have no choice.''

 NEAR SACOL ISLAND, PHILIPPINES: ... seaweed farmer.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although Bungalos says he and his gang would give up piracy if
they could, these uneducated men, none of whom finished elementary
school, have little prospect of landing a good job. Bungalos, 41,
spent 15 years as a rebel fighting for autonomy for Muslims in the
largely Catholic Philippines. He attributes the poor economic
prospects here to the government's disdain for Muslims, and to
multinational and Manila-based fishing companies that ``suck all
our fish out of the ocean,'' leaving nothing for locals.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he feels remorse. He wrote a letter to the kidnapped girl's
parents asking their forgiveness, and is putting his children
through school ``so they don't follow in my footsteps.'' His wife
and their nine surviving children live in a two-room wooden shack
on stilts, with tin roof and without furniture or electricity, in a
coastal village east of Zamboanga City. Bungalos visits a couple of
times a month, when he can slip away from his outlaws' island
hideaway.
</P>
<P>
   Five members of his gang have been killed in encounters with
authorities, and his wife says she would rather have him at home
and go without food than live off pirate's loot. Bungalos says he
would endanger the whole village if he returned to society; he's a
wanted man.
</P>
<P>
   Catching him _ or any other pirate _ is harder than one might
think.
</P>
<P>
   On patrol aboard the Filipino Flojo PG-386, a US-made 78-foot
gunboat, Navy Commander H. Robert Balanon Jr. pointed out the
``Eleven Islands,'' a circle of isles that are sanctuaries for sea
bandits.
</P>
<P>
   Pirates dart from one to another, hiding among the palms as
patrols pass. In the Philippines, as in other archipelago nations
like Indonesia or Malaysia, there are simply too many islands to
monitor around the clock. The terrain confounds strangers, and
pirates often are protected by corrupt local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   A long-running Muslim uprising in the Southern Philippines has
also fed piracy, as rebels have turned to crime at sea to fund
their rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   More than four months ago, the Abu Sayyaf group used speedboats
to kidnap 21 people from a Malaysian resort; it has made millions
by ransoming them. Last week, the group seized a 24-year-old
American and held him in a hideout on Jolo Island, where they
reportedly demanded $10 million for his release.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they see the Navy, they act like good guys. When the Navy
isn't here, they're bad guys,'' Lieutenant Bonifacio Manicap said,
aiming his binoculars at rows of laundry flapping from lines on one
of the hundreds of islands on the gunboat's patrol route, and at a
handful of people on a nearly deserted beach who stared back
suspiciously.
</P>
<P>
   Balanon, the commander, pointed to a tangle of brush along the
coast of Pilas Island that looked much like any other _ until a
squint of the eye revealed a tiny gap just large enough for a
canoe, opening into a hidden lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   Getting off a gunboat to pursue fleeing suspects into shallow
waters means abandoning the ship's formidable weaponry. Clambering
into an inflatable raft armed with just a .45-caliber handgun,
Manicap was understandably nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``These pirates have machine guns left over from World War II
that could sink a boat,'' he said. ``They have antitank guns. We'd
be helpless in this rubber boat if we encountered pirates now.''
</P>
<P>
   There are hundreds of ``pirate islands'' across Asia that are
simply outside the reach of the law. Balanon's gunboat is fitted
with daunting armaments _ four .50-caliber machine guns, two 7.62mm
machine guns, and a 25mm automatic cannon. But for the safety of
his crew, he refused to disembark at Siasi, known as ``Texas
Island'' because every inhabitant is reputed to carry a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, two officers from a sister gunboat, PG-387,
hopped ashore to buy cigarettes and were shot 30 yards away by
bandits who then fled with their guns. It was daylight, so their
mates assumed that the noise was from firecrackers. One man died on
the spot. The other staggered back to the ship, and the crew cast
off immediately rather than risk taking him to the local clinic. He
died before they reached the nearest island with a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A weather-beaten metal sign over Siasi's single paved road
offers a ``Welcome,'' but residents don't seem to echo the
sentiment. Idle youths scowled at the Navy ship. A young boy
fiddled with a 9mm pistol. The dusty, two-story wooden facades that
lined the port seemed straight out of a hardscrabble frontier town
in the American West. The only color breaking the monotony of brown
peeling paint was a bilious yellow adorning the local ferry and the
minarets of the mosque.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of a gunboat didn't cow several groups of armed men
who strutted under the noon sun with M-14 and M-16 assault rifles
slung across their chests. Balanon and his men stayed aboard,
conscious that they could do nothing. This was the sea bandits'
turf.
</P>
<P>
   After years of denial, Asian authorities are acknowledging that
they have a problem. Some have launched joint patrols on the most
dangerous waterways, such as the Strait of Malacca, at 500 miles
the world's longest strait, which links the Indian Ocean to the
South China Sea. Indonesia announced recently that it would
establish a center to monitor ships entering it. The maritime
industry, meanwhile, is calling for governments to adopt tougher
laws and sign international conventions against sea crime.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing a niche, security companies have cropped up in Britain,
the United States, Hong Kong, and Australia, providing former
soldiers to defend ships and to search for, and perhaps recover,
missing vessels. The services are controversial because of fears
that having armed mercenaries aboard could escalate the violence.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Maritime Bureau's Piracy Reporting Center in Malaysia has
set up a 24-hour hot line to track missing vessels, with some
success.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, it guided authorities to Global Mars, a Japanese
tanker loaded with palm oil that had been hijacked in Malaysian
waters in February, its crew set adrift. Tips gleaned by the center
indicated that the ship had been repainted and was operating near
Hong Kong as a phantom ship named Bulawan. China sent an aircraft
to investigate, and police boarded it in late May, arresting 11
Filipinos and nine Burmese. The ship was towed to the Chinese port
of Zhuhai, where the suspected pirates are awaiting prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippines is one of the first countries to try to respond
creatively to modern piracy, training and arming civilians to ride
aboard coastal fishing vessels. There are 176 such guards now, and
authorities began training more last month. Fishing captains say
the guards are a deterrent, but some vessels have been attacked
despite them. Three guards were killed in a pirate attack last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks have declined since the Philippine Navy and coast guard
boosted patrols. But actually catching any of the 22 known pirate
gangs is more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippine Navy operates a decoy vessel disguised as an old
fishing trawler (armed with five machine guns) to fool pirates into
attacking. On a recent night, the boat cast off after sunset with a
team of six Philippine Navy SEAL commandos aboard, hoping to
provoke an attack near Sibago Island. But the undercover boat has
been around since the early '90s, so pirates have come to recognize
and avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cat-and-mouse game,'' said Petty Officer 3d class Rocky
Galolo. And authorities cannot easily recognize the mouse; pirates
don't look like Blackbeard with a hoop earring. ``These pirates are
ordinary people like us. We can't identify them by looking at their
faces.''
</P>
<P>
   From the safety of his mangrove-covered cove, Bungalos sees Navy
patrols at a distance almost every day. But if he has his way, they
will never see him.

<P>
   NEAR SACOL ISLAND, Philippines _ He has neither hook nor peg
leg, but he is missing parts of two fingers and an inch of his left
leg, shot off in skirmishes with the Philippine Navy.
</P>
<P>
   He has no cutlass, preferring seven assault rifles, a grenade
launcher, and an array of automatic pistols. And who needs an eye
patch when you can snatch a nice pair of imitation Ray Ban
sunglasses from the captain of the ship you've just raided?
</P>
<P>
   Aliasa Bungalos, known and feared as ``Commander Alex'' around
the lawless islands and hidden coves that dot the turquoise waters
of the Southern Philippines, is a latter-day Captain Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   Guarded by a crew masked in balaclavas and bandannas and
brandishing M-16s, Bungalos recently let a journalist visit a
deserted island hideout, 11 miles east of the Philippine Navy's
southern base in Zamboanga City, for an extraordinary look at the
life of a pirate leader. Casually, he described what he does for a
living: sneaking up on ships in a fast launch, clambering up ropes
to board under cover of night, kidnapping and ransoming victims,
selling off the stolen loot.
</P>
<P>
   He is hardly unique.
</P>
<P>
   Piracy is back with a vengeance, and Bungalos is one of tens of
thousands of bandits of the sea who have spurred its resurgence
over the past decade. They prey on merchant mariners, fishermen,
shippers, even pleasure sailors and scuba divers of all
nationalities. Seajacking also poses severe environmental and
safety hazards in busy sea lanes. In 1994, two oil tankers collided
and burned, killing all aboard, after what was thought to be a
pirate attack.
</P>
<P>
   The number of reported pirate attacks has set a record this
year, and Asian waters are the new buccaneers' favored haunt. The
region's financial crisis, which began three years ago, the
political instability and armed insurgencies, and some of the
globe's busiest shipping lanes, have made Asia the site of three of
four pirate attacks worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But forget ``Yo ho ho, and a bottle of rum.'' Piracy does not
fit the Hollywood image of Treasure Island, swashbuckling fun, and
talking parrots. Buccaneers who terrorized the Caribbean in the
1700s were merciless criminals who forced their victims to walk the
plank while they stole a ship and its cargo.
</P>
<P>
   Modern pirates are sometimes members of sophisticated crime
syndicates who use global positioning systems, satellite phones,
falsified papers, and powerful speedboats to pull off
multimillion-dollar heists of tankers and cargo ships. But more
often they are hit-and-run bandits in motorized dinghies who prey
on fishermen, ferries, and yachtsmen, robbing them of any valuables
aboard. Bungalos's gang is one of these.
</P>
<P>
   What's common to almost all of these attacks is their
ruthlessness, the use of deadly weapons _ from knives and handguns
to antitank rockets and mortars _ and the cost to the maritime
world in lives, cargo, and ships.
</P>
<P>
   With 90 percent of the world's trade moving by ship, and nearly
half of it passing through Asia's pirate-infested waters, the
threat to global commerce is growing. Estimates of the cost of
piracy and maritime fraud run to more than $16 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   The pettiest incidents are essentially maritime muggings by
those who subsist by stealing fish, mooring lines, or cans of
paint.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious are meticulously planned attacks in which
organized crime gangs target valuable cargo, resell it in advance,
and prepare fake registration papers for a ship.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst cases, pirates kill the crew, repaint and rename
the vessel, and use the ``phantom ship'' to attack other vessels or
to steal millions of dollars of cargo from unsuspecting shippers
who unwittingly hire the pirates' fly-by-night company to transport
their goods.
</P>
<P>
   Shipowners reported 300 attacks or attempted attacks in 1999 to
the International Maritime Bureau, an industry watchdog, and 309 to
the United Nations' International Maritime Organization. But the
Maritime Bureau says the figures understate, by at least half, the
true picture.
</P>
<P>
   In figures compiled for the Globe, the Philippine Navy and coast
guard cited 28 pirate attacks in the first six months of this year.
The International Maritime Bureau recorded just one in Philippine
waters, based on reports from shipowners.
</P>
<P>
   Why the discrepancy? Cargo ships often do not report minor
attacks because they fear being detained by investigators; every
day in port costs thousands. Captains and shipowners sometimes
cover up attacks to protect their reputations. Coastal ships and
fishermen, meanwhile, report only to local authorities _ or not at
all, if they fear retribution.
</P>
<P>
   But the danger is growing. So far this year, reports of pirate
attacks have jumped 40 percent over the first half of 1999,
according to the Maritime Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian waters are by far the world's most dangerous, with
115 incidents reported in 1999, almost double the figure for the
year before.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 408 seamen were taken hostage, a jump of 67 percent
from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   As far back as 800 BC, sea bandits have plagued waters from
Taiwan to New Guinea, from Madagascar to Australasia, said a
Philippine Navy captain, Omar Tonsay, who has chronicled maritime
raids in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Bandits of the Sulu Sea, in what is now the Southern
Philippines, have long been reputed to be among the most vicious.
</P>
<P>
   But Tonsay says that what 16th-century colonizers branded
``piracy'' was for locals ``a tradition _ economic livelihood for
men and women, a rite of passage.''
</P>
<P>
   Islands provide pirates with countless safe hideouts. The
tangled branches of wild mangroves, and the shallow around Sacol
Island keep Bungalos and his gang out of sight and out of the reach
of the law. Dragging on a counterfeit Marlboro and showing off his
bullet scars, Bungalos recounted his resume while a Navy gunboat
patrolled not a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   Late one night, he and 12 of his gang used motorboats to attack
the Randy-Mar, a commercial fishing boat that had been preparing to
cast out its nets. They used the ship's anchor line to hoist
themselves aboard and stole fish-detecting sonar, ship radios, and
three guns, which they sold for 80,000 Philippine pesos ($1,778).
Another time, three of his men boarded the Magnolia ferry as
passengers and took the captain at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   They then threw ropes to seven accomplices in a launch below,
who shinnied on deck to steal cash, watches, jewelry, even clothes
from terrified passengers and crew.
</P>
<P>
   Bungalos's men have used speedy outriggers to zoom into coastal
towns and to snatch victims whose families could pay, including the
13-year-old daughter of a gas station owner. After holding her for
three months on Sacol Island, a pirates' lair where, Bungalos said,
``she was not touched, raped, or harmed,'' he negotiated $8,000 in
ransom and got ``three sacks of rice as thanks when we released the
girl.'' It's a lot more than the $55 a month he can make as a
seaweed farmer.

<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ They are a bionic lot, the three dozen men
who have come to the Longwood Cricket Club with titanium joints
(mostly new hips and knees) and rock-steady hearts (thanks to
pacemakers).
</P>
<P>
   Off the tennis courts, they are models of gentility and
sweetness, as great-grandfathers should be.
</P>
<P>
   But once the first ball is served, they become connoisseurs of
slow-motion torture.
</P>
<P>
   Their shots and cross-court vollies can make an opponent lunge
and stumble _ and a spectator wince at the prospect of witnessing a
heart attack on a baseline.
</P>
<P>
   This is survival of the fittest time at Longwood, otherwise
known as the annual National Grass Court Championships for men
almost a century old, vying for titles in the 85- and 90-and-older
age groups. The handouts say ``WELCOME!'' but the orthopedic
doctors who remade many of these men _ literally _ may want them to
stay away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come, now _ you'd be amazed what you can do if you put your
mind to it,'' said Paul DeCamp of New Orleans, 85, who was
diagnosed with rheumatic fever in 1940 and given a year or two to
live.
</P>
<P>
   Now a retired physician, DeCamp holds his age group's national
tennis doubles title for indoor and hard court play _ and Tuesday,
prior to a match, he was holding the left hand of Lacy, his bride
of one year. Both their first marriages had ended with the deaths
of spouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure I've added 10, maybe 20 years to my life playing
super senior tennis,'' added Ed Baumer of Coronado, Calif. He
picked up the sport at age 65 because he wanted a game he could
play during lunch on business trips; at the time, golf clubs didn't
fit in the airplane overhead bins.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, more than half the seniors vying for trophies at the
week-long, United States Tennis Association-sanctioned event that
began Sunday apparently never played before they were 60. Notable
exceptions include Gardnar Mulloy, 86, of Miami, America's
top-ranked player in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   But others, such as Kenneth Beer, a former pilot who is just shy
of his 97th birthday, first picked up a racquet in 1963 _ after he
retired from the former Pan American Airlines to live in
Hillsborough, Calif. Incidently, Beer first flew for the airline in
1928 _ one year after Charles Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Beer has been riding the leading edge of tournament play as
increasing demand from seniors has created ever-older age groups.
Longwood hosted the first Senior 70 tournament in 1973. And then
the club started adding more: the Senior 75 tournament in 1975, the
Senior 80s in 1980, the Senior 85 in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the first Senior 90s tournament began.
</P>
<P>
   Before his 11 a.m. match Tuesday, Beer began by warming up on
the backboard, hitting the ball 20 times in a minute without
letting it bounce.
</P>
<P>
   Six minutes _ and 120 errorless hits later _ he took five steps
back to start another exercise that allowed the ball to bounce just
once between hits. He took few steps, and everything else moved
slowly _ but with pinpoint accuracy and no wasted motion.
</P>
<P>
   Players say that at this age, tennis footwork is basically
reduced to a shuffle. The best shot is an unreachable one _ the
drop shot, the lob over a competitor's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ball control, not foot control,'' said one player. ``Let's cut
to the quick here. We don't have any foot control left.''
</P>
<P>
   Beer, one of six men in the tournament who are 90 years or
older, lost his 11 a.m. match to Bob Lawrence, 90, of Santa
Barbara, Calif. Lawrence, a retired business executive, climbs
mountains in Nepal and Switzerland when he is not playing tennis _
a game he picked up at age 69.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my first tournament,'' Lawrence said somewhat shyly
after his victory. ``I'm wired _ seriously. My pacemaker did
great.''

BASIC ERRORS MARRED MONDAY NIGHT OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With all the hype surrounding the shiny new additions to
``Monday Night Football,'' you would think the basics would be
covered.
</P>
<P>
   You know, the little stuff, like covering the game.
</P>
<P>
   Take the 86-yard punt return by Az-Zahir Hakim in Monday's
season opener between the Rams and Broncos. Instead of showing a
replay immediately, ABC showed people dancing at the refurbished
Union Station in St. Louis, then went to commercial.
</P>
<P>
   The first replay appeared shortly after the break and showed
only Hakim running downfield _ not the key blocks that created a
lane for him. Viewers had to wait longer for that, and when ABC
finally did show the replay from a different angle, viewers still
didn't get a good shot of the blocking.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did viewers get much clarity on Terrell Davis's injury. At
first, new color analyst Dan Fouts said Davis injured his right
ankle, and given that Davis had injured his right knee last year,
that was significant.
</P>
<P>
   Fouts's reporting, however, didn't match up with that of
sideline ace Melissa Stark, the former ESPN reporter, who told
viewers that Davis injured his left ankle, then followed up with
definitive word that Davis would miss the remainder of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Left, right? Who cares? Fouts tried to shrug it off by joking
that the Broncos were taping both ankles as a decoy. Who knew Fouts
was the real comedian in the booth?
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the Patriots play the New York Jets in
next week's Monday night game. Let's see what the ABC crew does if
the game is not as exciting as the Rams-Broncos thriller. The game
received a 10.6 rating and 20 share in Boston. It peaked around 10
p.m. with a 13.7 rating and 22 share.
</P>
<P>
   Boston viewers will need more than the obvious. Viewers here
already know the Patriots don't have much of an offensive line. We
already know the running game is virtually nonexistent. And we
certainly know about the rivalry between the Jets and Patriots
since Bill Parcells left in a huff.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see how much leeway Dennis Miller has
during the broadcast, given the fact that Patriots owner Bob Kraft
is a member of the NFL's powerful broadcast committee. Let's see
how many stadium-finance jokes Miller tells. Let's see if Boston's
unique brand of politics is ripe for some of Miller's satire.
</P>
<P>
   Miller improved from his practice sessions during three
preseason games, largely because he simply shut up. Miller, the
supposed savior of the showcase game, limited his rants during
Rams-Broncos but still managed to get off a few good lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were worried that I was going to use a lot of
profanity,'' Miller said. ``But the only f-word I'm going to use is
`Faulk.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the ABC crew was helped by having an exciting
game. Play-by-play man Al Michaels is still able to define a
situation with very few wasted words. He hit the nail on the head
when he described the Rams' attack as ``speed, speed, and more
speed.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing Michaels is still in the booth. Consider the
following observation during the first quarter. Rams quarterback
Kurt Warner had thrown an interception to end a drive near the goal
line _ the pass bounced off the tight end and into the hands of
linebacker Al Wilson. Fouts opined, ``Warner threw five
interceptions in the red zone last year, and this one is not his
fault.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. Everyone watching the game could see that.
</P>
<P>
   Pity Michaels. He has to come through for three straight hours
with little help from his new pals.

HOLD THE TUNA, ADD SOME SPICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ It wouldn't surprise me if they spent parts
of spring and summer practicing their answers for this week. Maybe
they stood in front of the bathroom mirror, speaking to an
imaginary press corps on how Jets-Patriots was ``just another game
on the schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe wives and children were involved. ``Sweetheart? Kids?
Could you come in here for a second? Daddy wants you to listen to
something: `Look, you guys are trying to sell papers and I
understand that. It's your job. My job is to win games. If a win
happens to come against New England, so be it. All division games
are important, and . . . Hey! What's with the snickers? I'm not
finished.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This morning, Jets coach Al Groh and Patriots coach Kevin Spacey
(a.k.a. his identical twin, Bill Belichick) will hold press
conferences in different cities, for different audiences, at
slightly different times. But they will be saying the same things.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, their teams will meet in Giants Stadium in an
event that used to be known as the Tuna Bowl. Since the Tuna, Bill
Parcells, is no longer coaching, we should call this game by its
rightful name: the Alimony Bowl. Cleaned-out divorcees cringe every
time these teams play. When Parcells and Curtis Martin divorced the
Patriots and went to the Jets, it practically cost the New Yorkers
the house. When Belichick finally divorced the Jets, the Patriots
had to part with some property _ a first-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   Now, this acrimonious game has been passed on to a new
generation of leaders. Gone are Tuna and Mr. P.C., Pete Carroll. In
are Groh and Belichick, both former Parcells assistants. The new
guys may tell you that times have changed and that this game
doesn't have the same amount of venom as ones in the past. You know
what? They're right.
</P>
<P>
   What this game has is more venom than the others. By far. There
is more ill will now than in the previous six games combined.
</P>
<P>
   When the Patriots hired Belichick, Parcells said, ``The border
war is over.'' But the reality is that the border war has been
replaced with psychological warfare. It is ruthless and petty.
There is a lot of gossiping involved. There is a lot of whispering
involved. There is a lot of Deep Throat dime-dropping involved. And
there are more angry people involved than before. It used to be a
basic Parcells vs. Robert and Jonathan Kraft rift. Now that there
has been a split of the Parcells coaching family, the rift has
deepened.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a coincidence that we suddenly are seeing a videotape
of Parcells forgetting the score at the end of last season's
Patriots-Jets opener. There was the Tuna in the fourth quarter,
walking on the field, looking like the NFL's Rip Van Winkle. It was
obvious that he didn't know the score. He looked confused, which is
exactly what the anti-Parcells camp wanted people to see; that, you
know, Parcells is not infallible.
</P>
<P>
   Smart people with NFL experience should know better. There have
been more significant errors in more significant games. Mike
Holmgren lost track of the downs late in Green Bay's Super Bowl
XXXII loss to Denver. It happens.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's not to say Parcells is a martyr. In his book,
written with the Globe's Will McDonough, he suggested that
Belichick had a deal with the Patriots even though he was under
contract with the Jets. Parcells said he couldn't prove it, but
that was his feeling. Let's just say that the Tuna probably should
have left that section out of the book.
</P>
<P>
   If Belichick indeed had a side deal with New England while under
contract, he certainly wasn't the first to do something like that.
There are strong indications that Parcells had a deal in place with
the Jets while he was contractually bound to the Patriots in 1997.
When contacted at his office Tuesday, Parcells said he was going to
``respectfully decline to comment.'' He is expected to speak with
the New York media later this week.
</P>
<P>
   As you might imagine, both camps are downplaying their
frostiness. And there's a lot to downplay. Patriots offensive
coordinator Charlie Weis had some of his play-calling duties taken
from him by Parcells last season. Think he doesn't want to prove
something to the big guy for disrespecting him like that? Groh was
given the job by default, so he will always struggle to be visible
during the Jets' Tuna Eclipse. Belichick was head coach of the Jets
_ twice _ without ever coaching a game. He was portrayed as a nut
when he left New York, and there still isn't a good relationship
with Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Patriots, the ones who actually will be
playing in the Alimony Bowl, this has very little to do with the
game. Hard feelings or not, they still have to figure out a way to
protect their quarterback. They still have to find a running game.
They still have to overcome some of their quirks, such as a center
who goes Knoblauch on you whenever a shotgun snap is required.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots cornerback Otis Smith was asked how he thought
Belichick would approach this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll probably work the (expletive) out of us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The coach would do that even if next week's opponent were
Minnesota or Buffalo. But that's where the similarities stop.
Patriots-Jets another division game? No extra emotion? No
pathology? Come on. I've heard that joke before.

DISCOVERING VIVID IMAGES FROM HOLLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The title ``Van Gogh to Mondrian'' is slightly
misleading. With very few exceptions _ Kees van Dongen is about the
only other one _ the artists in this show at the Museum of Fine
Arts won't be familiar to the average survivor of Art History 101.
That's part of the show's charm _ discoveries to be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Van Gogh to Mondrian: Dutch Works on Paper'' originally was
organized by Peter Schatborn for the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam,
where it was called ``Rond 1900.'' For the MFA presentation,
curator Clifford Ackley has made judicious additions from the
Boston museum's collections.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of many shows _ including ``1900: Art at the
Crossroads'' at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, and
``ModernStarts,'' which appeared earlier this year at New York's
Museum of Modern Art _ to look at what was going on at the turn of
the last century.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty was. ``Van Gogh to Mondrian'' is more focused than either
of those blockbusters, covering only works on paper from only one
country from a span of only 30 years. Still, its variety
astonishes: everything from the dark realism that automatically
says ``Dutch'' to vivid versions of Art Nouveau that don't, to
posters that prefigure the De Stijl movement.
</P>
<P>
   In his fine catalog essay, Carel Blotkamp argues that while
Dutch graphic work around 1900 looked a lot like other European
art, its uniqueness lay in its ``strong tendency to impose upon the
image a rigorous geometric order.'' The British strain of Art
Nouveau was, however, just as geometric: Liberty of London designs
will spring to the minds of many as they look at Gerrit Willem
Dijsselhof's 1898 ``Wallpaper with fava bean motif.''
</P>
<P>
   Blotkamp also points out that French Impressionism never
established much of a foothold in Holland, leaving the door open to
new styles, and that there was an emphasis on
``Gemeenschapskunst,'' or ``public art,'' which was less a matter
of personal expression and more geared toward wide dissemination of
images in monumental wall paintings, posters, and book design.
Another characteristic of Dutch art of the era was its borrowing
from ``exotic'' sources. Japanese prints had influenced European
art for decades; Dutch art, because of Holland's long trade
association with Indonesia, added that country's imagery to the
mix. Patterns reminiscent of batiks and figures that look like
shadow puppets crop up often in the MFA show.
</P>
<P>
   Except for works by artists the caliber of Van Gogh, Mondrian,
Van Dongen, and Jan Toorop, the decorative and commercial designs
outweigh the ``fine'' arts in the show. Toorop moved between both
worlds. His poster for ``Delftsche Slaolie,'' a salad oil, became
so famous that Dutch Art Nouveau was dubbed the ``salad oil
style.'' Aubrey Beardsley's influence is evident in Toorop's
swirling line that threatens to camouflage the actual subject.
You're so engulfed by the endless whiplash curves that describe the
hair and billowing dresses of the two women in the work that you
hardly notice that one of them is indeed tossing a salad, and that
the peanuts from which the oil is made appear in a heraldic square
in the upper left.
</P>
<P>
   Toorop had a Symbolist side as well, in compositions such as the
1892 ``O Grave, Where Is Thy Victory?'' in which two attenuated
angels untie the brambles _ i.e. the earthly cares _ of a corpse
about to be laid to rest, as nasty monsters try in vain to claw at
the lifeless figure.
</P>
<P>
   Johan Thorn Prikker's drawing of ``Three Figures (Singing
Trees),'' a trio of ethereal and elongated women, and Matthew
Maris's black chalk ``Peace,'' a pair of misty figures on the verge
of evaporating, are further examples of the mystical strain in
Dutch art. So is Edzard Willem Koning's ``Virgin and Child Seated
in a Landscape,'' ensconced in a garden of sunflowers and
hollyhocks. Simple, sincere, and symmetrical, the work owes much to
Gauguin and the School of Pont Aven.
</P>
<P>
   On the more commercial side are illustrated calendars, posters
for entertainments, and book and magazine covers, which use some of
the same design tactics to a very different end. Johann Georg van
Caspel's poster advertising the first issue of the journal ``De
Hollandsche Revue'' is a rhythmic row of seated men, all bent over
the same publication; more copies lie in a reading rack in front of
them, just in case. Theodoor van Hoytema's 1893 version of Hans
Christian Andersen's ``The Ugly Duckling'' is densely illustrated
and has a Japanese feel, with the ducks' feathers all subdued into
scallops. Dutch art has been enamored of flora and fauna for
centuries, and that interest only intensified around 1900. Samuel
Jessurun de Mesquita's 1913 woodcut ``Egret'' is an eye-fooling
play of lines that remind you that Mesquita was the teacher of M.C.
Escher.
</P>
<P>
   The most beautiful flower in the show is Mondrian's 1909-'10
watercolor ``Golden-Rayed Lily,'' which is shown twice: once in the
prime of its life, petals flaring, stamens jabbing; then as limp as
a used tissue. Both are suspended in an aquatic, blue-dappled,
pointillist atmosphere. It's a trio of Mondrian tree pieces,
though, hung together, that is the show's high point. The three go
from a luscious watercolor of foliage reflected in water to a 1911
black chalk ``Tree'' that edges toward abstraction. Structure
reigns supreme in both, with branches expanding to fill the page,
as if they wanted to rule as much space as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The small number of van Gogh works in the show is something of a
disappointment. (The reason the Dutch drawing show is in the MFA in
the first place is to accompany ``Van Gogh: Face to Face,''
thepainting show upstairs.) The drawing show pieces range from the
straggly backyard of the 1882 ``Nursery Garden, The Hague'' to the
vertiginous ``Landscape With Houses Behind Trees,'' an Auvers
drawing from 1890, the year the artist died.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dongen was born near Rotterdam but spent most of his working
life in Paris, and his Fauve style looks like nothing else in this
show. ``Belly Dancer'' is an exercise in hedonism, the exuberantly
half-nude figure stretching her arms sideways and tossing her head
to one side, basking in a shadowy halo of pink.
</P>
<P>
   Scenes of urban life by George Hendrik Breitner and Isaac
Lazarus Israels are dark and pedestrian, outmoded in comparison to
the rest of the show. Their work carries little indication that the
40 Dutch artists in the exhibition lived at a time of sea changes
in art, some constituting brave manifestos. Toorop, for instance,
created a visual call to arms in his 1893 colored chalk drawing
``Pattern of lines. Rise of the new art, meeting resistance.'' But
for some reason he kept it mum, not exhibiting the work during his
lifetime, then leaving it to his widow. (It's now in the collection
of the Gemeentemuseum in The Hague.) Its complex imagery is typical
of Toorop. A four-legged creature, with four female torsos blowing
trumpets, tramples on the prone figure of the old, traditional art.
One of the most fascinating aspects of the picture, in addition to
its bizarre fairy-tale invention, is that it continues right onto
its carved wooden frame, as if Toorop were continuing one of the
main movements of the time _ the union of art and craft.

MASTER OF THE WEIRD, ARTIST EDWARD GOREY IS MISSED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By ELLEN BARRY 
c.2000 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COTUIT, Mass. _ The black canvas backdrop of the Dismal Swamp
has rolled silently out, a thumbtack has been stuck into the hammer
of each piano key for a creepy, off-kilter sound, the tiny
white-faced puppet is being stalked across the stage by a looming
character named Ooze, but Edward Gorey is not in the house.
</P>
<P>
   When Gorey, Cape Cod's most famous eccentric artist, died
suddenly in April at the age of 75, he left a few clues about his
intentions with regard to ``The White Canoe,'' the 13-act puppet
opera now playing at Freedom Hall.
</P>
<P>
   There was, for instance, the small triangular stone that he
mailed to the composer in Frankfurt, with the one-line instruction,
``The more attention given this stone, the more likely it is to
turn back into a frog.''
</P>
<P>
   There were cryptic notations on scraps of paper found among his
things, with messages like ``Spirits of the swamp: insects: Loie
Fuller sleeves,'' and, on one, ``Alligators have tails.''
</P>
<P>
   As opening night approached, director Carol Verburg threw up her
hands at guessing what Gorey would have wanted, even though she had
worked alongside him in staging his plays on the Cape for the last
12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling her efforts to decode ``Loie Fuller sleeves'' _ her
research revealed that Fuller was a turn-of-the-century dancer
renowned for her diaphanous costumes and not much else _ Verburg
looked down at her teacup as if for assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I'm the director,'' said Verburg. ``What do I do with
this?''
</P>
<P>
   After 40 years' worth of verse and drawings won him a reputation
for intriguing obscurity, Gorey's theatrical productions on the
Cape marked a sharp turn in the direction of pure bafflement.
</P>
<P>
   Having reached his widest audience with his illustrations for
the opening credits to PBS's ``Mystery!'' series, Gorey spent his
last years like a semi-retiree, free to follow his impulses with
little regard for what the public thought, said Andreas Brown of
New York's Gotham Book Mart, an executor of Gorey's estate.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every summer for a decade, vacation theatergoers primed
for ``Brigadoon'' might find themselves faced with a dramatic
reading of Isaac Newton's Latin exercise book or a full-length
performance of Oscar Wilde's ``Salome'' featuring a muscular man in
the role of the Biblical temptress. When Gorey transferred his
attention to the nearly featureless three-fingered puppets he
called Le Theatricule Stoique, the conventions of plot and
character development went out the window. So much so that even
Brown sometimes pleaded with Gorey to be just a little less
cryptic.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Gorey's actors stopped being surprised when half
the audience left during intermission. The motley crew of amateurs
who stuck with him _ a letter carrier, a nursery-school teacher and
a former soap opera actress, among others _ stopped minding. But
this summer, as the actors? performers strain on tiptoe behind the
puppet theater, the absence of the man who was both creator and
single essential audience member has left them that much more in
the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us were in service to Edward's vision,'' said Jane
MacDonald, 49, who began working with Gorey eight years ago when
she and her husband bought a motel on Route 6A. ``We knew a lot of
people walked away saying `What was that about?' Sometimes it
didn't add up to anything on an emotional curve or any other kind
of curve. I mean, it didn't have a beginning, a middle and an end.
But we knew what Edward wanted. Whether or not they got it, it was
like, `Oh, well, he's here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For the 25 years he spent in Yarmouthport, in a 200-year-old
house piled with books and metal tools, Gorey proved fairly
effective at ignoring his fame, politely whisking away admirers.
His talents were focused locally, on such low-profile projects as a
poem in honor of a neighbor's amputated toe. (``Alack! Alas!/It's
come to pass/His left big toe/Has had to go,'' it read in part, and
was illustrated with a toe that had sprouted angel's wings.)
</P>
<P>
   When his puppet troupe traveled to Los Angeles for its first
out-of-town tour two summers ago, Gorey shuddered at the thought of
leaving Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   But in the months since his death, overseas newspaper homages
and new translations have made it clear that interest in Gorey is
far from local and far from abating. For now, enough written work
exists to satisfy that hunger, Brown said; buried in his nest of
papers, executors have found between 75 and 100 unillustrated texts
and six complete books.
</P>
<P>
   High on the list of works that may have depended on Gorey's
presence, though, are the strange little plays, which seemed to
develop spontaneously: a New Orleans-style funeral procession of
puppets carrying peacock feathers, hatpins or surgical instruments;
a white-on-white puppet kabuki show that ``just put you into a
trance,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Richards, 49, a broad, bearded nursery-school teacher who
became one of Gorey's favorite amateur actors, recalled one puppet
show cast entirely with painted clothespins, and how Gorey rebuked
the puppeteers for just moving them ``up and down and side to
side.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Edward, they're clothespins!'' they protested. But before long
the clothespins did seem to bend.
</P>
<P>
   Others recalled how words that came up by chance would find
their way into scripts, so that an ingredient in a Nantucket
Nectars drink would suddenly resurface as a dog named ``Citrus
Cloud Emulsion.'' Eventually, said Richards, Gorey's actors learned
not to memorize their lines too early.
</P>
<P>
   That process may be possible without him, Brown said, or it may
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carol's very brave to step into the breach and make this into
a reality without any guidance from Edward,'' said Brown. ``They're
all going to be trying to second-guess. I'm just hopeful that it's
going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   A dress rehearsal for ``The White Canoe'' featured a clutter of
disembodied heads, egg-beater props and one singer napping with a
tiny proscenium arch over her head. The show itself, with its
ballet-dancing alligators and doomed, swamp-bound lovers (``Did
you, my dearest, hear a sound?/I think it came from underground'')
could not be mistaken for another man's work.
</P>
<P>
   And only the performers miss Gorey's sardonic ``No, dear,'' or
``Less, please,'' or, echoing his idol, the choreographer George
Balanchine, ``I want as less as possible.'' Perhaps most noticeably
missing is his gasping laugh, their only gauge of success, although
the puppeteers, jostling each other in a pool of light behind the
stage, still listen for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What strikes me, and what's been striking to me all along, is
that everything we do points to his absence,'' said Eric Edwards, a
tall, craggy man of 53 who works a rural mail route in Mashpee.
``The show should be wonderful and funny. Nobody should be able to
discern the difference between Edward having directed it and not,
but for the people involved, I can speak about what I feel, and
what I feel is the absence of Edward.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, this production of ``The White Canoe'' runs the risks
of a sentimentality that Gorey might have kept at a distance. The
lush backdrop was painted by veteran set designers Herbert Senn and
Helen Pond, Yarmouthport neighbors who were fully aware, Senn said,
that Gorey himself would have stuck with the three dessicated
desiccated wooden doors he usually used for a stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We miss him acutely,'' the program notes read, and many in the
opening night audience seemed to know they were attending an elegy.
, packed with worshipful friends and fans, came prepared for an
elegy.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make you miss the days when the audience walked
out, said Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a kind of cool thing about being this avant-garde and
not-very-much-watched and not-very-much-paid-attention-to thing.
You know what we got out of it? We got 11, 12 years of Edward,''
said Edwards. ``All that time spent with a freaking genius.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, smiling: ``And not just an ordinary genius.''

AFTER CRITICISM, CHINA CRACKS DOWN ON PIRATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANWEI, China _ There was no SOS signal, no storm, no sighting
of a sinking ship. A 14,000-ton freighter just vanished into thin
air.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 16, 1998, the Cheung Son, a Hong Kong-owned cargo ship
loaded with furnace slag, lost contact with its owners en route
from Shanghai to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, a horrified fisherman near this southern
Chinese port pulled up his net to find a bound corpse, its mouth
taped shut and lashed to a 175-pound metal bar. It was the first of
10 bodies found tangled in nets in the following weeks, all later
determined to be among the 23 members of the Cheung Son's crew. The
ship itself was never seen or heard from again.
</P>
<P>
   A long coastline, a booming and increasingly deregulated
economy, and powerful organized crime networks have made southern
China a hub for the most serious form of modern piracy: the
hijacking of entire cargo ships, which are repainted, renamed, and
used to troll for fresh victims at sea. With the crew disposed of
and the ship under a new flag, the pirates advertise these ghost
vessels as legitimate cargo carriers and then disappear with the
cargo.
</P>
<P>
   Since January 1999, China has cracked down, devoting hundreds of
police officers in dozens of cities to solving six of the most
serious cases of modern piracy. Chinese courts have dealt harshly
with the perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   After the capture of scores of Chinese, Indonesian, Burmese, and
Filipino suspects _ and the well-publicized execution this year of
14 of them _ robberies in the South China Sea have nosedived, and
murders during high seas attacks have dropped off to nearly zero,
according to international figures.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese crackdown has begun to quiet earlier accusations
that Beijing was soft on crime at sea or even colluding with the
perpetrators. The charges were leveled following a series of
hijackings by pirates wearing Chinese law enforcement uniforms and
a case in which Chinese authorities seized a ghost ship but later
released its crew.
</P>
<P>
   One outspoken critic _ Captain Pottengal Mukundan, director of
the International Maritime Bureau _ now praises Chinese authorities
for sending ``a clear signal to these gangs that they shouldn't
bring their cargo to China.''
</P>
<P>
   In the only interviews granted to foreign media on the subject,
Chinese police sketched the dramatic trail that led to those
responsible for the disappearance of the ship Cheung Son, the most
brutal case of piracy in modern Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 2, 1998, the ship's owners reported that they had lost
contact with the ship two weeks earlier, when it was off the coast
of Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Authorities issued an international
all-points bulletin and called the ship's phone and fax repeatedly.
Someone answered, but kept hanging up.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, clubbed and bound bodies began turning up near
Shanwei, a port at nearly the same longitude as Kaohsiung. Police
hit the docks and learned that a local man ``went to sea and came
back with a lot of money and a dented boat,'' said Ni Baodui,
deputy director of the Shanwei Public Security Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Police combed nearby ports for suspicious craft and hit pay dirt
in Dongshan, in the neighboring province of Fujian. Authorities
secretly boarded a boat and found a 30-foot-long scratch with paint
from another vessel. A lab test confirmed that it matched the paint
of the Cheung Son.
</P>
<P>
   In early January 1999, police tracked down the owner of the
dented boat, who was hiding in a fishing village not far from
Shanwei. He admitted he had lent his vessel to two other men and
said they could be found in Shenzhen, a seedy, freewheeling area
next to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Three hundred police officers raided a karaoke bar where gang
members were celebrating and surrounded the two ringleaders,
tackling one in a football-style pileup when he tried to buy a
train ticket to escape.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian leader of the gang told authorities he was paid
$350,000 for the ship and cargo by his boss, an Indonesian named
Roger who worked for a Singapore shipping company. He couldn't say
where the freighter was, and police were unable to track down
Roger. Li said Indonesian authorities ignored numerous requests for
help from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of interrogation, authorities learned that the
Cheung Son gang members or their alleged kingpin had been involved
in at least three other high-profile pirate attacks, a break that
led to the arrest of 22 suspects in the Sept. 9, 1998, attack on
the Luisa, a Singapore-based palm oil tanker.
</P>
<P>
   Li Xiaoping, head of the organized crime task force for
Guangdong province _ a bureau that devoted all of last year to
piracy investigations _ said police discovered that the pirates had
disguised themselves as officials to get onto ships for bogus
inspections. A celebratory photograph taken by the Cheung Son
culprits showed them wearing fatigues.
</P>
<P>
   Li said the crackdown does not mean that China will flout the
law to prosecute pirates. He cited the case of the Tenyu _ a ship
carrying aluminum ingots that was hijacked in Indonesia and found
off southern China, renamed Sanei I. The Indonesian crew was
released last June after six months of investigation, Li said,
because they insisted they had been hired legitimately and had no
idea that Sanei I or its cargo had been stolen. Police could not
prove them wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't have enough evidence, we can't just hold people,''
Li said. Authorities now believe that the pirates hired the crew to
sail the ghost ship and that the mastermind was the same man who
plotted the seizure of the Cheung Son. Tenyu's original crew of 15
has never been found and are assumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   In January, 12 men convicted of murdering the Cheung Son's crew
and the owner of the boat they hired to carry out the crime were
sentenced to death in a heavily publicized trial in Shanwei.
Nineteen others received prison terms, and six were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   In a bizarre scene shown across China, the convicted murderers
staggered drunkenly before the firing squad singing, ``Go, go, go!
Ale, Ale, Ale!'' _ the refrain from Ricky Martin's World Cup theme
song.
</P>
<P>
   Li said the tough sentences were intended to send a message.
``With the open economy, there is more and more shipping through
China, and those waters should be safe,'' he said. ``It is not just
our duty; we want to crack down on piracy.''

COLLEGE INVESTMENT PLAN WORKS, BUT NEEDS TO BE MORE SYSTEMATIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I feel I have not made a very wise decision. In October, I
invested $1,000 in a mutual fund to help with my grandson's
education. I contributed $250 more through random investments of
$50 each. The latest statement shows 63 shares, no dividends, and
capital gains distributions of $7.18. I'll continue the $50
contributions for as long as possible. Should I stay with my plan?
</P>
<P>
   S.C., San Diego
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think you made a mistake at all. Even though this
year hasn't been a terrific one for stock funds, the current value
of your investment is $1,363 and change. If you had put $1,000 into
a CD account paying 5 percent 10 months ago, and added $25 a month
(for the same total investment of $1,250), the balance would be
$1,296.
</P>
<P>
   It is reasonable to expect that over the next 14 years the stock
market will have spurts, both positive and negative, and will do
what it has been doing for most of this year, which is go nowhere,
by and large. But it is also reasonable to expect that in the long
run you will get returns of about 10 percent. If that happens, and
if you continue adding at the current rate, which I calculate at
about $300 a year, the account would grow to $14,591 by the time
your grandson is 17 _ a handsome start toward paying for college.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing I suggest you change is the pattern of your
contributions. When you say they have been random, it suggests to
me that you have been adding when the fund seems to be doing
better, and probably holding back when it's been in the doldrums.
That's only human, but the inevitable result is that you're missing
the chance to buy the cheapest shares. Set a schedule for
contributions, and stick to it _ regardless of the state of the
market. In your case, this might work out to a plan to send $50 on
the first day of every month. The odds are strong that this
discipline would return better results than investing at random.
</P>
<P>
   You chose a solid fund, rated above-average by Morningstar
Mutual Funds. Its year-to-date return of 5.29 percent compares
favorably to the 4.9 percent return for the median fund in the same
investment category _ holding the stocks of large companies that
represent a blend of growth and value orientation. I suggest you
stick with the plan.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I had to retire in 1985, with heart problems and cancer, and
liquidate my business. All I wanted to do was provide for a
dignified lifestyle for my wife, who was unsophisticated in
financial matters and came from a very long-lived family. I put
everything into Treasury bills and annuities _ about $2.5 million
worth at that time. Everything would have worked out fine _ except
I didn't die! We lived comfortably on an income of about $100,000
and even distributed money to our grandchildren for college
expenses from time to time. My problem is that the pile is
shrinking. Interest rates on Treasuries no longer support our
lifestyle, inflation is growing, and increasingly we are cutting
into the fully taxable annuities, creating higher tax bills and
shrinking the pile even faster. We have started to cut back on
expenses, but my concerns for the dignified lifestyle for my wife
are growing again. What would you suggest I do with the $485,000 in
cash?
</P>
<P>
   A.L., Onset, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. My suggestion would be to look at alternatives not only for
the $485,000 now in money markets, but for all of your savings.
Inflation has dug severely into the buying power of your money.
From 1985 until last year _ the latest for which statistics are
available _ inflation raised the price of $100,000 worth of goods
and services to $154,800. Estimating the average yield of your
current holdings at 5 percent, you are generating a yield of
$80,500, putting you $74,300 in the hole each year.
</P>
<P>
   If your savings were earning the current highest rate for
five-year jumbo CDs, 7.71 percent, your yield would be $124,131,
meaning you would be dipping into your capital at only $30,669 a
year. If you maintained withdrawals at that $154,800 annual rate,
the pool would last you or your wife 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   But you're going to have to do some work to get close to that
yield, establishing many CD accounts, and most of them at
institutions you've probably never heard of. Nonetheless, these
relatively new banking institutions do enjoy the protection of FDIC
insurance up to $100,000 for an individual account.
</P>
<P>
   The best tool for tracking them down is the computer. If you
have not gotten into the world of computers, find a friend who has
and ask him to go to one of the many Web sites that list the
highest current interest rates and the institutions' toll-free
phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   I use bankrate.com. As this is written, it lists the highest
rates ranging from that 7.71 percent at the leading institution to
7.22 percent at the 16th highest. (The full list of the top 30
rates finished with five institutions offering a flat 7 percent
yield.) These rates contrast to a national average of 6.34 percent
for five-year jumbos, so it is well worth doing the work to get the
top rates, especially with sums as large as yours.

EXTREME TV: HATE GROUPS EXPLOIT CABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRANFORD, Conn. _ In a normal week, viewers whose remote
controls stop at Channel 21 might find a group of local boys
sharing wrestling techniques, a town selectman honoring a retiree,
or the Rev. Walter Oliver preaching about modern-day evils while a
soloist sings gospel music in the background.
</P>
<P>
   This is exactly what you'd expect on a public access cable
channel in a town small enough that the appearance of an Elvis
impersonator at a local restaurant causes a buzz. So, few were
prepared when Matt Hale started showing up on Channel 21 with his
chilling call for whites to prepare for a racial war. Hale's white
supremacist speeches were first broadcast in half-hour installments
last week in seven towns in south-central Connecticut, part of AT&AMP;T
Cable Services.
</P>
<P>
   Hale is from half a country away, taping his broadcasts in his
home in East Peoria, Ill. He got on the air in Branford the same
way he has managed to get on in Washington state, Indiana, and
Florida: He used the Internet to attract followers who in turn took
copies of his tapes to their local cable company and requested that
they be aired on the public access channel.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic is becoming more common as hate groups across the
nation discover they can spread their messages free and with little
regulation on public access television.
</P>
<P>
   While controversial programming has occasionally popped up on
public access channels since the 1980s, many in the industry have
been taken aback by Hale's avowed campaign to spread his message of
racial intolerance one public access station at a time. Specialists
say Hale is exploiting a fundamental intent of many local access
channels on cable systems nationwide to give ordinary citizens a
public soapbox.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hale's extremist views are drawing widespread
criticism, cable officials and regular viewers are grappling with
where the line should be drawn between free speech and
manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a tavern on Branford's main drag, Edward Dimenstein,
a local lawyer who is Jewish, said he despises Hale, who argues
that minorities and Jews should be deported. But Dimenstein rejects
the idea of censoring him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I disagree with the man and his views, but he has the right to
express those views,'' Dimenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Hale, 29, the leader of The World Church of The Creator, is
banking on exactly that reaction from his critics. Smiling into the
camera at the start of his first broadcast, Hale said, ``Public
access is indeed for the public, and we intend to utilize it.''
</P>
<P>
   While pressure to regulate the growing number of hate groups on
the Internet continues to rise, specialists say extremists are
discovering the power of public access and stirring a debate among
First Amendment advocates, public access administrators, and racial
activists about whether community television is truly the virtual
platform the government intended it to be, or whether it has become
an alarming ``Gong Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People have the right to say what they want, regardless of how
outrageous it is,'' said John Roberts, executive director of the
Massachusetts branch of the American Civil Liberties Union. ``If
you give the government the power to decide who will speak and what
they will say, then they are going to clamp down on all kinds of
political speech.''
</P>
<P>
   But Susan Fleischmann, executive director of Cambridge Community
Television, said public access advocates are beginning to look for
ways to combat negative programs like Hale's ``White Revolution''
without censorship. If a local subscriber comes to her station with
controversial programming, the station will make sure the
subscriber is aware of the content and, where appropriate, invite
community groups to submit programming to counter it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are starting to say it doesn't make sense to be totally
hands off,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Gross, head of Tampa Bay's Anti-Hate Committee of B'Nai
B'rith, said that might not be enough. For years, Gross has fought
to keep groups like The National Alliance off the air in Florida.
He says shows like Hale's are far too dangerous to ignore for the
sake of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think public access has been a failed experiment. There is
some speech that is so heinous that it should not be accepted in a
decent society,'' said Gross. ``There are volatile people who look
at these messages and, unfortunately, act on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hale said in a telephone interview that whites who marry
minorities should be assassinated, while insisting he doesn't
condone violence. Instead, he says, his soldiers are peacefully
distributing videos to public access TV stations across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Brian P. Davis, 21, of Wallingford, Conn., brought
``White Revolution'' tapes to AT&AMP;T Cable Services, according to the
officials at the station.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, Davis was arrested in upstate New York when,
it was reported, police found several rounds of ammunition and a
semiautomatic rifle in his car. He could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   In his first of nine different programs, Hale dedicates his
speech to another follower _ Brian Smith, who over the July 4
weekend in 1998 killed two men and wounded eight during a shooting
rampage in Indiana and Illinois during which he targeted minorities
and Orthodox Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Hale said Smith, 21, who eventually turned the gun on himself,
was a kind man who couldn't take the unfair treatment white people
face daily.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, who hosts his own weekly show on Channel 21 in Branford,
said after viewing ``White Revolution'' that he's disturbed that
Hale is defending a murderer. Oliver said the public access channel
is watched by many, adding that he himself is recognized across
Connecticut by viewers. Oliver also said he hopes people will
reject Hale's message.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give a person a right to speak, but you have to
get someone to rebut him,'' said Oliver, who is black.
</P>
<P>
   Hale said his followers will use public access television to
teach ``racism'' to white children and to attract young
misunderstood people like Smith to ``the cause.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to have it (the show) on in as many places as
possible, and wherever white people are. We believe we can win them
over,'' said Hale, who lives with his father in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Congress mandated local access channels for public,
educational, or governmental use, according to a spokesperson for
the Federal Communications Commission. Federal law prohibits cable
companies from interfering with the editorial content of the
program unless the program is deemed obscene.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say groups have used public access television not only
to espouse their views but to threaten others. In May, a Klansman
who used his show to threaten a woman and her child settled a
lawsuit by agreeing to pay her part of his salary.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes cable operators say they can do little more than
sit back and watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's happening and it's disturbing. We hold our noses, but we
have to allow it. It's tough at times,'' said Dale Clift, executive
director of Nutmeg TV, a Connecticut public access organization.
``Whether you believe in the First Amendment or not _ you really
are tested when the material that is put on the air is something
which you don't agree with.''
</P>
<P>
   Locally, Jeff Hansell, executive director of Malden Access TV,
said airing the messages of a Neo-Nazi or a Klansman is every
public access administrator's worst nightmare. He said Malden's
public access station has been able to limit offensive programming
by reminding the viewers who want to sponsor it that ``they will be
held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   In the small Branford office of AT&AMP;T, the staffers have found a
more subtle way to respond to ``White Revolution.'' The show is
followed by ``Mr. Crayon Man,'' a children's favorite in which a
man dressed like a giant Crayola teaches children that all crayons
are different, and no one is better than the other.

THANKS TO THE BOOMING US ECONOMY, IT'S LABOR'S DAY AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Passing around cups of water as the sun pounded the picket
line outside Raytheon Co.'s Lexington, Mass. headquarters last
week, workers complained bitterly of shifting job assignments,
layoffs, and shrinking paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Bruno, whose grandmother started working for the company in
1946, said she felt betrayed by a $4 hourly wage cut after his old
job, as a plater, moved to Austin, Texas, and he began assembling
radar and missile components for Raytheon.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Minasian, who once built and tested circuits, was bumped
down to a job providing few challenges and paying $150 a week less.
And Sharon McNulty, who has transferred among a half-dozen Raytheon
plants in Massachusetts during 22 years with the company, frets
about paying $76 each month to test her pacemaker battery since
Raytheon terminated health benefits for strikers three days after
they walked out.
</P>
<P>
   The angry voices of Local 1505 of the International Brotherhood
of Electrical Workers sing discordant notes as the economy
continues to hum along. But this summer has seen several
well-publicized strikes, as workers seek to use the leverage of a
tight labor market to wring concessions from companies after years
of declines in both union membership and clout.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't escaped Raytheon workers that friends who had been
laid off by the company in recent years were snapped up by other
employers like Amtrak or M/A-Com and Alpha Industries, both growing
wireless communication companies.
</P>
<P>
   As striking Raytheon veteran Cathy Stanton says: ``Everything is
so good out there, and we're going backward.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raytheon walkout is the first against the defense contractor
since 1966. The company has offered a 14.7 percent pay increase
over the life of a four-year contract. But members of Local 1505,
which has declined from 10,000 workers in 1990 to 2,700 today, say
they are holding out for greater job security at the defense
contractor's manufacturing operation.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy helping them, other workers around the country
are scoring successes. Some unions are negotiating favorable
contracts with employers, such as Verizon Communications and
General Motors Corp., which fear work stoppages while US sales are
strong and global competition is fierce. In other successes, nurses
who went out on strike in Massachusetts put limits on mandatory
overtime. Food processors in the South won full health benefits
under newly negotiated contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Organizing drives in recent years have brought a union to
janitors in California, hotel employees in Las Vegas, and doctors
and service workers nationwide. Organized labor has even cut a path
into Arkansas-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc., a bastion of
antiunionism: Twelve meatcutters in a Texas store joined the United
Food and Commercial Workers International in February.
</P>
<P>
   Union membership in the private sector surged in 1999 by 96,000,
to nearly 9.4 million. It was the second year in the past decade
that union representation in the private sector has risen after
years of decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hemorraghing has stopped,'' said Tom Juravich, director of
the Labor Relations and Research Center at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst. ``We're not seeing the long, drawn-out
defeats that we saw for labor in the 1980s. Unions are taking a
much more strategic approach to bargaining and organizing.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be a stretch to declare labor will prevail over
corporate America, where union membership has plunged from 36
percent of all private-sector employees in 1953 to just 9 percent
today. Labor's gains have been incremental, even with a
labor-friendly administration in the White House. A new worry for
labor leaders is a fast-growing sector of the economy _ high
technology _ that is nearly devoid of union influences.
</P>
<P>
   But in industries tied to union labor, employers seem eager to
reach faster, more favorable settlements and ensure that assembly
lines keep running.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, which is reporting record sales of trucks and
sport utility vehicles, did not stop at a 3 percent wage increase
for auto workers in a contract with the United Auto Workers last
year. The company also agreed to cost-of-living adjustments and
equal pay for members employed at a parts unit that had been spun
off by the company.
</P>
<P>
   The union also won strong guarantees that GM would not close or
spin off plants employing UAW members. The company even agreed to
beef up pay for laid-off workers, said Douglas Fraser, who was the
UAW's president from 1977 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``The auto workers probably have more bargaining power than they
ever had. You have bargaining power when you have the ability to
shut a company down and keep them down,'' Fraser said. Global
competition has made auto makers even more vulnerable, he added,
``so the balance of power has shifted a bit in favor of the
union.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer, workers at Verizon (formerly Bell Atlantic)
capitalized on the company's fears that a strike would disrupt
customer service or allow competitors to move in. A contract was
negotiated in just two weeks, after 85,000 telephone workers from
Maine to Virginia walked off the job Aug. 6 due to the expiration
of a two-year pact.
</P>
<P>
   In a contract that workers called ``path-blazing,'' members of
IBEW and the Communications Workers of America won new rights to
organize workers in the company's expanding wireless division,
which grew out of Bell's merger with GTE. In a watershed provision,
the contract allows wireless workers on the East Coast to become
part of the union if 55 percent sign union application cards. These
card checks, prevalent during the 1930s, are extremely unpopular
with corporate management because they are an easier route to
organizing than a full-blown union vote, which can be challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The union came out on top with Verizon. They won the big
issues. They reduced the company's opposition to the organization
of the wireless workers,'' said Paul Osterman, a professor in the
Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   The short strike was a hardship for Verizon workers, who
received only $200 from the union's strike fund. But Kathy
McGreevey, a mother of two and treasurer for CWA Local 1400 in
Portsmouth, N.H., the primary representative for telephone service
representatives in New England, said it was easier to hold out
knowing that, ``in this market, we can get jobs. We can wait for
the contract to be up to our standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Such bold attitudes are in stark contrast to labor's dog days in
the 1980s when President Reagan fired striking air traffic
controllers (1981) and George A. Hormel &AMP; Co. declared war on
striking workers in a small Minnesota town (1985) and hired
permanent replacements. Unlike Hormel's strikers, today's workers
have ``less fear of the employer resorting to the use of permanent
strike replacements,'' said Steve Early, a national representative
for CWA International.
</P>
<P>
   The longer the US economy continues to expand, said Leo Troy,
labor expert at Rutgers University in Newark, the more workers will
``feel they have a good future and need not worry about economic
dislocations, including what would happen in the event of a strike.
This should benefit unions in one sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Troy, nevertheless, believes unions will fail to reverse their
shrinking presence in corporate America even if the boom continues.
For example, a strong economy, in another way, works against union
organizing efforts, he said, because nonunion workers have
``confidence that they don't need a union. That's the other side of
the coin people forget to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   As unions deteriorated, so did their ability to preserve wages.
According to new data from the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal
Washington think tank, in 1978 blue-collar workers' wages were
nearly 27 percent above nonunion workers' pay. Today, that premium
has fallen to 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Haynes, president of the AFL-CIO in Massachusetts, said
that's why the Verizon strike was significant for all workers.
``The labor movement finally figured out we've got to get these new
workers and new technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   In the South, the United Food and Commercial Workers has
campaigned successfully on behalf of low-paid workers in the
grocery and food industries. In a drive to improve members' health
benefits, the union staged several strikes against grocery store
operators during the late 1990s. In another victory, UFCW secured
health benefits for the first time for members in the South,
including catfish processors in Mississippi and nursing home
workers in Alabama, said union spokesman Greg Denier. Bucking the
overall trend in corporate America, Denier said his union's
membership has grown steadily, from about 1.3 million in 1990 to
1.42 million currently.
</P>
<P>
   The food industry, in Denier's view, has a strong ally in the
tight labor market. Employers, particularly grocery stores, often
thwart labor's efforts to organize by ``churning'' workers, pushing
older workers out and hiring young ones. ``As labor markets
tighten, you see employers begin to realize that if they turn over
employees, there'll be no one else to hire for the job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For striking Raytheon workers, whose average age is 45, the
benefits of a tight labor market go only so far.
</P>
<P>
   Local 1505 members have skills _ they do precision work
involving wafers and circuit boards _ in heavy demand by, for
example, the booming telecommunications industry in New England.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a tinge of bravado in their claims they could find
work elsewhere. In truth, many are insecure that they would need
additional education or training. None wants to sacrifice hard-won
seniority, vacations, and pay that averages between $30,000 and
$40,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   So a decision to strike was difficult for Mark Bruno, a divorced
father whose two children were covered under his health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   But ``that's where we're at,'' he said. ``We've made the
decision to go out and get other jobs if we have to.''

BOUNDARIES FADE IN MEDICAL SPECIALTIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Margaret Prendergast knew she would need an operation to get rid
of the benign tumor in her uterus that was bleeding and producing
punishing pain. Prendergast, a registered nurse, logically presumed
it would be her gynecologist who did the cutting. Or maybe a
surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   She never dreamed it would be a radiologist, the sort of
specialist who historically spent days cloistered in the hospital
basement in a dark, windowless room ruminating over X-rays and MRIs
and virtually never venturing into the realm of real live patients.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did a radiologist do the operation, he did it without
the hysterectomy her gynecologist had said she'd need, using his
high-tech imaging equipment to expertly excise three-quarters of
the tumor and leave behind only dead cells. Procedures like hers
are delighting patients, but they are igniting a turf war between
the new army of ``interventional radiologists'' and the surgeons
who had always reigned unchallenged in the operating room.
</P>
<P>
   That's just one in a series of battle lines being drawn as the
old divisions between medical specialties become increasingly
blurred. Psychiatrists trained to do therapy are spending their
days dispensing drugs, displacing pharmacologists who are the drug
experts. Dermatologists used to tending acne and skin cancer are
surgically sucking out fat cells and smoothing out wrinkles _ the
very cosmetic work plastic surgeons were schooled in.
Gastroenterologists are being transformed into surgeons, urologists
are spending less time on kidney stones and more on impotency, and
ophthalmologists are performing laser surgery that makes eyewear
obsolete and puts other ophthalmologists out of business.
</P>
<P>
   The world of medical specialization is being turned on its head
_ raising doubts about whether specialists are adequately trained
in their ever-evolving specialties, pitting doctors who dominated a
domain against those pushing their way in, and setting off alarms
about whether money drives the system rather than doctors' skills
and patients' needs. Many patients, meanwhile, are uncertain
whether to see a radiologist or a surgeon to treat a tumor, and
unclear whether they should take their unruly child to a
psychiatrist, a pharmacologist, or the family pediatrician.
</P>
<P>
   Today's medical specialists are ``constantly reinventing
themselves. It's happening more than it used to because of the
enormous increase in medical knowledge and technical skills,'' says
Dr. John Harrington, dean of the Tufts University Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Delbanco has been watching that evolution from his perch
as chief of general medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center, and it worries him: ``Radiologists and pathologists didn't
want to deal with people so they went into diagnostic areas, but
suddenly they've become interventional. On the other side of the
coin psychiatrists are people who went into a field where they
wanted to talk to patients. Now they're suddenly pharmacologists,
and they're not always very good at it. I find them making lots of
mistakes with drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll all end up being good at what they do,'' Delbanco
adds, ``but the transition is what's dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Prendergast, meanwhile, says that while she had heard of the new
breed of interventional radiologists during her work in hospitals,
``I am sure the average person has no clue what an interventional
radiologist does. I'm fascinated by the whole thing. It amazes me
what these radiologists can do, what mine did for me. It worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical history is full of examples of breakthroughs in
technology and technique putting pressure on doctors to branch out,
often onto thin limbs. Joseph E. Murray, the first kidney
transplant surgeon, was a plastic surgeon who had done the
operation on more than 100 dogs. He made the leap to people
effectively enough to be awarded the Nobel Prize. It was the same
for the first orthopedic surgeons to do joint replacements and
cartilage transplants. Doctors always have had to reinvent
themselves, sometimes in ways that totally redefined their
specialties, and those who followed oftentimes had to go back to
school to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, the reinvention is happening at supersonic
speed, in medicine as in most high-technology fields. And it is not
just changing technology that is pushing the pace, but also
economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers have made clear what kinds of medical work they will
pay for and what they will not, and doctors have adjusted
accordingly, even if that means venturing into uncertain areas.
Oncologists, for instance, are trained to examine and counsel
patients with cancer, but these days they also often administer
chemotherapy themselves and perform other procedures for which they
will be more generously reimbursed but about which they are less
well trained. Dermatologists have pushed the envelope even further,
with some devoting large parts of their practices to liposuction,
hair transplants, and other procedures that patients pay for out of
their own pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that doctors out in the community who aren't specially
trained aren't doing them,'' Dr. David Feingold, chairman of
dermatology at New England Medical Center, says of the new push
toward cosmetic procedures. ``It would be a shame if medical
dermatology gets the short shrift in this. It's true that a lot of
people are doing a lot of cosmetics, but it's only because patients
are clamoring for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatry has been even more radically reshaped by a
combination of scientific breakthroughs and shifting reimbursement
philosophies. When Dr. Margaret Ross graduated from medical school
in 1974, therapy was the main weapon in a psychiatrist's arsenal
and drugs were used only to treat severe cases of disorders like
depression. Today Prozac and other antidepressants are being used
to treat everything from panic attacks to obsessive-compulsive
disorders. Therapy, by contrast, is under siege by researchers who
insist it does not work and insurers who will not pay for more than
a few sessions. The result, Ross says, is that nearly half the
patients she sees as a staff psychiatrist at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology are on some sort of medication and for many
of her colleagues it is 80 or 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Such changes are exciting for young doctors who were trained in
them and like to picture themselves on the cutting edge.
``Radiologists always have been pioneers in computer-oriented
things that traditionally doctors had a phobia about. Innovation is
the realm of the radiologist,'' says Dr. David Brophy, 34,
Prendergast's doctor and one of the new generation of
interventional radiologists who today account for nearly 20 percent
of that specialty, but who still are an enigma to most patients.
``We do have a big identity problem. I say I'm an interventional
radiologist and people don't have any idea what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   For some doctors like Ross who have been around longer, all the
changes can be unsettling. ``Psychiatrists today feel less good
about what they do,'' says the 51-year-old therapist, ``and fewer
people are going into psychiatry. People say the training has
become much more administrative, how to get people into hospitals
and out. It's not the sort of really intellectually satisfying deep
connection with people we used to experience with long-term
psychotherapy. I don't want to say it's not satisfying, but it's a
very different kind of connection. I'm not sorry I went into it,
but I do have my days.''
</P>
<P>
   The transition is even harder for doctors in their 60s and 70s.
``Older practitioners often feel left out and never recover from
their failure to keep up with the technology,'' says Dr. Joseph
Martin, dean of the Harvard Medical School. ``Technology does
develop more quickly now than it is able to be disseminated to
people who can use it in their practices.''
</P>
<P>
   Some physicians respond by refocusing on aspects of their
specialty where they feel most comfortable and competent. Others
take the continuing education courses and other training that, in
this era of perpetual change, have taken on new urgency. Some
specialists could be shifting focus at the peril of their patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm less worried with cognitive practitioners like
psychiatrists who really keep up pretty well; it's not that
complicated to learn how to use major medications,'' says Martin.
``I worry more about technically sophisticated areas of surgery,
radiology and dermatology, where doctors take on a procedure like
liposuction without having the true training or ability to
recognize complications.''
</P>
<P>
   All the recent criss-crossing of specialties has generated a
reaction among at least some doctors who see their traditional
domains being invaded. Nowhere is that more apparent than with
surgery, which has seen its turf encroached upon by everyone from
dermatologists to radiologists and gastroenterologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing our people retiring at a younger age than they
used to,'' says Dr. Thomas Russell, executive director of the
65,000-member American College of Surgeons. ``In the old days
surgeons never retired; they loved their work. Today, a lot of
older doctors are being a little overwhelmed by some of these
changes and having trouble keeping up.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short-term there is pain and conflict, and you get turf
battles,'' Russell adds. ``We'll eventually overcome that. In
surgery we're seeing an erosion of our specialty and we have to be
aware of that and able to loosen up.''

RAYTHEON WORKERS DRAW A LINE OVER SUBCONTRACTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
  Raytheon Co. says it doesn't understand why manufacturing
employees walked off their jobs last week. Union officials are
trying to explain their concerns by picketing in front of the
company's old plant in Quincy, Mass.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once it produced microelectronic parts at the plant for radar
systems and commercial goods. Raytheon still needs the parts, but
now it buys them from a New York-based company, Imrex LLC, which
acquired Raytheon's production machines last year and moved them
away from the unionized work force.
</P>
<P>
   The deal eventually will eliminate nearly 300 jobs, just one
round of cuts as Raytheon turns over manufacturing work to a
growing network of mostly nonunion subcontractors. These companies
generally pay employees less than $40,000 a year, the average wage
of members of the striking union, Local 1505 of the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
</P>
<P>
   The union represents most of the company's blue-collar work
force in Massachusetts, and a decade ago it had around 10,000
members. Today it has just 2,700 as Raytheon follows the lead of
other companies, such as Lucent Technologies and Cisco Systems.
Both have sent their stock values soaring by turning over the heavy
lifting to so-called ``contract manufacturers'' such as Jabil
Circuit Inc. of St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Jabil moved in to an abandoned Raytheon factory in
Billerica, Mass., where it now employs 500 people. ``Companies are
now discovering that it's cheaper for us to manufacture their
goods,'' said spokeswoman Lisa Allison.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon executives won't discuss their outsourcing strategy,
except to call it ``a function of being competitive.'' But in past
interviews chief executive Daniel Burnham and others have made it
clear the company wants to emphasize its white-collar projects, to
keep up with growing military demands for advanced software and
computer chips.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon said it fell 1,000 people short of its hiring goals for
technical specialists last year, contributing to a decline in
earnings forecasts and a resulting drop in its stock price to
roughly a third of the high it reached last year.
</P>
<P>
   Striking workers, meanwhile, point to nearly a dozen examples of
manufacturing and assembly work sent away, they say to avoid union
pay scales.
</P>
<P>
   On its Web site, Local 1505 cites circuit-card assembly work
done by Group Technologies Corp. in Tampa, Fla., and sheet-metal
work by Pneumafil Corp. in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   In Quincy, striker Norman Eldeb described recent visits by
executives from a Kentucky company, Lexel Imaging Systems,
interested in buying equipment that Eldeb operates to make
cathode-ray tubes. The components are still sold as spare parts for
aging computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must think we're going to teach them how to operate this
equipment, so they can take away some of our last jobs,'' said
Eldeb. The visit, he said, helped convince him to vote to strike.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance the job action might seem reckless, since Local
1505's strike fund amounts to just $59 a member.
</P>
<P>
   On the central issue of job security, Raytheon says the strikers
can't realistically demand more than the company's offer of a
four-year contract, including pay raises averaging 3.5 percent and
guarantees that at least four missile and radar programs will
remain in Massachusetts during that period. Raytheon says it pays
the workers 25 percent more than the average local wage, and that
voluntary attrition is less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The only guarantees over the long run, Raytheon says, come from
satisfying customers such as the Pentagon. Besides, said spokesman
David Polk, ``The profile of manufacturing has changed dramatically
in this region.''
</P>
<P>
   But many union members are convinced their jobs are doomed
eventually unless they extract firmer commitments now.
</P>
<P>
   With many members due to receive pensions in five to seven
years, the strike seems rational even though the company's specific
offer ``wasn't the worst thing in the world,'' said striker Ed
Staats, a technician at Raytheon's big plant in Andover.
</P>
<P>
   But subcontracting worries him, he said. ``Basically why we're
standing here is to bring this to a head, rather than get kicked
out one at a time,'' said Staats, 56, a Raytheon employee for 34
years.
</P>
<P>
   A Group Technologies representative confirmed that the company
does work for Raytheon, but declined to elaborate, citing a
confidentiality agreement between the companies. Executives from
Pneumafil and Lexel didn't return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Imrex president Harry Armon said he didn't want to discuss the
equipment purchased from Raytheon or the new locations of the gear.
``I've very hesitant to say much, given that Raytheon's on
strike,'' he said. ``I don't want to get involved.''
</P>
<P>
   By sending its work out, Raytheon saves about $3 an hour per
worker, estimates the Associated Industries of Massachusetts, a
trade group. The group says lower costs also have helped to attract
other manufacturers to the state, such as Solectron Corp., which
employs about 1,200 workers in Westborough. Charlie Richardson,
director of a labor extension program at the University of
Massachusetts at Lowell, says that companies can save as much as $5
an hour by avoiding unions.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson also notes that big manufacturing unions have done
little to organize new members in recent years. Only this year did
Local 1505 hire an organizer to leaflet companies such as Jabil.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, the right to organize these facilities also has become
a key issue in the strike. Union leaders want Raytheon to remain
neutral during organizing drives at outside plants, while the
company fears that could lead to higher costs.
</P>
<P>
   Some employers say the Raytheon workers have waited too long
before trying force their employer's hand. Carol Shibles, owner of
Central Metal Finishing Inc. in North Andover, Mass., said orders
from Raytheon have increased in recent years even as it has moved
to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself to be a small business, and we have to be
more productive and more competitive than we would be within the
walls of a big company,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Central Metal, which did about $5 million in revenue last year,
is a nonunion shop with 70 employees who are paid an average of $10
to $12 a hour. Since the strike began, several Local 1505 members
have applied for jobs at Central Metal, seeking to be paid around
$20 an hour as inspectors. Shibles said she might pay $15 to $17 an
hour and expects the union members might accept. Currently, she
said, ``They're at a premium.''

EXTREME TV: HATE GROUPS EXPLOIT CABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRANFORD, Conn. _ In a normal week, viewers whose remote
controls stop at Channel 21 might find a group of local boys
sharing wrestling techniques, a town selectman honoring a retiree,
or the Rev. Walter Oliver preaching about modern-day evils while a
soloist sings gospel music in the background.
</P>
<P>
   This is exactly what you'd expect on a public access cable
channel in a town small enough that the appearance of an Elvis
impersonator at a local restaurant causes a buzz. So, few were
prepared when Matt Hale started showing up on Channel 21 with his
chilling call for whites to prepare for a racial war. Hale's white
supremacist speeches were first broadcast in half-hour installments
last week in seven towns in south-central Connecticut, part of AT&AMP;T
Cable Services.
</P>
<P>
   Hale is from half a country away, taping his broadcasts in his
home in East Peoria, Ill. He got on the air in Branford the same
way he has managed to get on in Washington state, Indiana, and
Florida: He used the Internet to attract followers who in turn took
copies of his tapes to their local cable company and requested that
they be aired on the public access channel.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic is becoming more common as hate groups across the
nation discover they can spread their messages free and with little
regulation on public access television.
</P>
<P>
   While controversial programming has occasionally popped up on
public access channels since the 1980s, many in the industry have
been taken aback by Hale's avowed campaign to spread his message of
racial intolerance one public access station at a time. Specialists
say Hale is exploiting a fundamental intent of many local access
channels on cable systems nationwide to give ordinary citizens a
public soapbox.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hale's extremist views are drawing widespread
criticism, cable officials and regular viewers are grappling with
where the line should be drawn between free speech and
manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a tavern on Branford's main drag, Edward Dimenstein,
a local lawyer who is Jewish, said he despises Hale, who argues
that minorities and Jews should be deported. But Dimenstein rejects
the idea of censoring him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I disagree with the man and his views, but he has the right to
express those views,'' Dimenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Hale, 29, the leader of The World Church of The Creator, is
banking on exactly that reaction from his critics. Smiling into the
camera at the start of his first broadcast, Hale said, ``Public
access is indeed for the public, and we intend to utilize it.''
</P>
<P>
   While pressure to regulate the growing number of hate groups on
the Internet continues to rise, specialists say extremists are
discovering the power of public access and stirring a debate among
First Amendment advocates, public access administrators, and racial
activists about whether community television is truly the virtual
platform the government intended it to be, or whether it has become
an alarming ``Gong Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People have the right to say what they want, regardless of how
outrageous it is,'' said John Roberts, executive director of the
Massachusetts branch of the American Civil Liberties Union. ``If
you give the government the power to decide who will speak and what
they will say, then they are going to clamp down on all kinds of
political speech.''
</P>
<P>
   But Susan Fleischmann, executive director of Cambridge Community
Television, said public access advocates are beginning to look for
ways to combat negative programs like Hale's ``White Revolution''
without censorship. If a local subscriber comes to her station with
controversial programming, the station will make sure the
subscriber is aware of the content and, where appropriate, invite
community groups to submit programming to counter it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are starting to say it doesn't make sense to be totally
hands off,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Gross, head of Tampa Bay's Anti-Hate Committee of B'Nai
B'rith, said that might not be enough. For years, Gross has fought
to keep groups like The National Alliance off the air in Florida.
He says shows like Hale's are far too dangerous to ignore for the
sake of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think public access has been a failed experiment. There is
some speech that is so heinous that it should not be accepted in a
decent society,'' said Gross. ``There are volatile people who look
at these messages and, unfortunately, act on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hale said in a telephone interview that whites who marry
minorities should be assassinated, while insisting he doesn't
condone violence. Instead, he says, his soldiers are peacefully
distributing videos to public access TV stations across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Brian P. Davis, 21, of Wallingford, Conn., brought
``White Revolution'' tapes to AT&AMP;T Cable Services, according to the
officials at the station.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, Davis was arrested in upstate New York when,
it was reported, police found several rounds of ammunition and a
semiautomatic rifle in his car. He could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   In his first of nine different programs, Hale dedicates his
speech to another follower _ Brian Smith, who over the July 4
weekend in 1998 killed two men and wounded eight during a shooting
rampage in Indiana and Illinois during which he targeted minorities
and Orthodox Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Hale said Smith, 21, who eventually turned the gun on himself,
was a kind man who couldn't take the unfair treatment white people
face daily.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, who hosts his own weekly show on Channel 21 in Branford,
said after viewing ``White Revolution'' that he's disturbed that
Hale is defending a murderer. Oliver said the public access channel
is watched by many, adding that he himself is recognized across
Connecticut by viewers. Oliver also said he hopes people will
reject Hale's message.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give a person a right to speak, but you have to
get someone to rebut him,'' said Oliver, who is black.
</P>
<P>
   Hale said his followers will use public access television to
teach ``racism'' to white children and to attract young
misunderstood people like Smith to ``the cause.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to have it (the show) on in as many places as
possible, and wherever white people are. We believe we can win them
over,'' said Hale, who lives with his father in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Congress mandated local access channels for public,
educational, or governmental use, according to a spokesperson for
the Federal Communications Commission. Federal law prohibits cable
companies from interfering with the editorial content of the
program unless the program is deemed obscene.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say groups have used public access television not only
to espouse their views but to threaten others. In May, a Klansman
who used his show to threaten a woman and her child settled a
lawsuit by agreeing to pay her part of his salary.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes cable operators say they can do little more than
sit back and watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's happening and it's disturbing. We hold our noses, but we
have to allow it. It's tough at times,'' said Dale Clift, executive
director of Nutmeg TV, a Connecticut public access organization.
``Whether you believe in the First Amendment or not _ you really
are tested when the material that is put on the air is something
which you don't agree with.''
</P>
<P>
   Locally, Jeff Hansell, executive director of Malden Access TV,
said airing the messages of a Neo-Nazi or a Klansman is every
public access administrator's worst nightmare. He said Malden's
public access station has been able to limit offensive programming
by reminding the viewers who want to sponsor it that ``they will be
held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   In the small Branford office of AT&AMP;T, the staffers have found a
more subtle way to respond to ``White Revolution.'' The show is
followed by ``Mr. Crayon Man,'' a children's favorite in which a
man dressed like a giant Crayola teaches children that all crayons
are different, and no one is better than the other.

100.8, fourth-highest of any quarterback on Sunday. Yet there were
grousings about Garcia's performance. By KEVIN LYNCH.

 &HT;    Doc's life made full by listening
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wilford Chaney's first surgery was performed on a ``patient'' _
a pig _ after his father ordered him, ``Take the pig over this hill
and shoot it.''
</P>
<P>
   The pig had a hernia that dragged the ground when he walked. It
was the 1930s, and Chaney was taking pre-med courses at Ohio
University while working full time as a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpening his pen knife, Chaney performed the surgery, buying a
temporary reprieve for the doomed pig.
</P>
<P>
   The anecdote is one of hundreds in Chaney's recently
self-published book, The Making of a Family Physician, which is
one-half autobiography and one-half advice book for ``embryo
doctors,'' as he likes to call them.
</P>
<P>
   Chaney, 90, is retired from a long career as a family
practitioner in Oakwood, Ohio, and, later, an associate professor
at the Wright State University College of Medicine. He lives with
his wife of 67 years, Dorothy, in an Otterbein Lebanon Retirement
Living Community cottage that is filled with his original oil
paintings _ a hobby he took up at 80.
</P>
<P>
   Chaney wants to be something more than a Norman Rockwell
portrait of the Doctor Who Makes House Calls. He believes he has a
vital message to present-day doctors who are too well-versed in
technology and too little versed in human nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listened to my patients,'' Chaney said. ``I used to let them
tell me what was the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   When he once took an informal survey of fellow retirees, the top
complaint against doctors was, ``They don't listen to me.'' (''They
charge too much'' came in a distant third.)
</P>
<P>
   Although Chaney complains of being slowed by Parkinson's
disease, he smoked through the 100-page autobiography. ``And it was
so good, and everything fell right in line,'' Dorothy said proudly.
</P>
<P>
   Being raised on a farm in Ohio's Meigs County proved the perfect
early training for a young doctor. Chaney wrote: ``My pets and farm
animals taught me responsibility and compassion, which I needed
later in life.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, having saved $800 during eight years of teaching, he
entered Ohio State University as a medical student. By the March
1943 graduation day, he had three young daughters to support.
</P>
<P>
   By 1946, Chaney charged $5 for a house call. ``That got up to $7
in 1975,'' he said apologetically, ``and $10 after midnight.''
</P>
<P>
   House calls, meanwhile, are as extinct as the dodo. Chaney said
that's a shame _ for the doctor: ``I learned more about the patient
from one house call than from 10 hours in the office.''
</P>
<P>
   When teaching at WSU Medical College in the early '80s, Chaney
warned his students of the dangers of overmedication. At least one
of those students, television medical reporter Dr. Sherry Wheaton,
never forgot the message, or the professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell that he loved what he did, and you could tell
that patients loved him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember how you told us to have our patients bring in all
their pills in a box?'' Wheaton asked during a recent visit. ``I
never forgot that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I got through to one person, didn't I?'' Chaney smiled.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Chaney is against modern medicine _ far from it.
It's simply that he believes that technology, however miraculous,
can never replace the power of touch, the power of listening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get too busy to listen and shut off your patients,'' he
writes. ``Please note that the news will soon spread that 'My
doctor listened to me.' ``

 &HT;    Protection of minority views is essential to our democracy
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The outburst of Christian fundamentalism and activism is a red
light for America, we are the warning light for our culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could watch TV without being offended at the casual sex
portrayed, the defiant attitude of children in sitcoms toward their
parents, the increasing news reports of kids shooting up their
schools, mothers killing their own children through abortion, I
would not have reason to pray out loud,'' wrote one of the many
readers who objected to a recent column about ``spontaneous
prayer'' at high school football games.
</P>
<P>
   The column was written in response to a ``No Pray, No Play''
movement at the Santa Fe, Texas, high school where student-led
prayers over loudspeakers were ruled unconstitutional by a 6-3 vote
on the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The court's majority has consistently struck down efforts to use
government to dispense religion. The constitutional principle
always is the First Amendment's establishment clause that the
justices consistently interpret as calling for a separation of
church and state.
</P>
<P>
   While I agree with that interpretation, it is clear that many
Americans strongly disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus told us to make disciples of all men, we are just
obeying our God when we tell others about Jesus and God'' was a
typical response to my column.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to make the point that the United States was not founded
to be a Christian nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States was once a Christian nation,'' wrote another
reader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we return to honoring God and having prayer,'' she
wrote. She finished with a nice prayer for me.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has never ruled against prayer. Actually, the
right to pray is constitutionally protected free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do schools have Halloween and Valentine Day programs when
these are celebrations of pagan gods that dwell on the supernatural
and erotic practices?'' asked another reader.
</P>
<P>
   Other readers went to great lengths to provide historical
evidence that many of the Founding Fathers believed in God and were
deeply religious. No doubt that is true. But being religious and
keeping the government out of religion are not mutually exclusive
concepts.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goodness, have you been living under a brick?'' asked
another unhappy reader. ``Since the '60s and all the junk that has
filtered out since, our country is being seen as the most backward
country on the face of the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   The reader urged support for more prayer at school and football
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were founded on the American ideal of being a Christian
nation,'' wrote another reader who challenged me to read the
history books.
</P>
<P>
   Several readers wanted to know why I wrote that Santa Fe's
minority of Jewish, Mormon and Catholic residents report they feel
surrounded by hostile forces in a religious war.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, they wanted to know why Catholics would object to
the recitation of the Lord's Prayer at Santa Fe high school
football games.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Fe officials were sued by two anonymous families, one
Mormon and the other Catholic. These two religions are distinct
minorities in the small town 30 miles southeast of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports, the supporters of public prayer over high
school loudspeakers have made life difficult for Catholic, Mormon
and Jewish families in Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the responses to the column opposed my opinion.
Perhaps even the majority of Americans would like to see the
government advocate religion. It makes me appreciate even more the
Constitution's protection of the minority from being squashed by
the majority.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Texas loses ground in emissions testing
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The '80s model car takes off from a standing start and leaves a
milky trail. One hundred yards and a cloud of smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The car disappears down the road. The exhaust sits abandoned,
then drifts. It is a scene witnessed without note at intersections
across Texas.
</P>
<P>
   If you could bottle that pollution, how much would you have?
</P>
<P>
   Modern-day automobiles with the latest pollution controls and
fuel efficiency are 97 percent to 99 percent cleaner than those 20
years ago, said Dr. Neal Carman, clean air director of the Lone
Star Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   The average car emits about 22 grams of carbon monoxide a mile.
The smoking car at the intersection may be kicking out 100 times
more, said Carman. That would mean roughly six times the pollution
over those 100 yards than the average car emits over a mile. There.
For you to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   In three metropolitan areas _ Houston, Dallas-Forth Worth and El
Paso _ cars are checked for tailpipe emissions exceeding federal
standards. But getting to that point has not been as straight a
line as from one intersection to the next.
</P>
<P>
   With the Environmental Protection Agency threatening to withhold
millions of highway dollars under the Clean Air Act of 1990, the
Texas Legislature in 1994 set up tailpipe emissions testing in the
three metro areas.
</P>
<P>
   For a variety of reasons, the system lasted only one month
before the state pulled the plug. The firm contracted, Tejas
Testing Technologies, sued the state and won $135 million for its
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   For another year and a half Texas went without any emissions
testing. Then, the EPA growing irritated, the legislature
authorized a new on-site inspection program paired with safety
inspections. It began in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, pollution had gotten so much more acute in the
Dallas area, for instance, that it got bumped up a notch from
``moderate'' to ``serious'' non-attainment of the Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of emissions testing alone could hardly be blamed
for the increase, but EPA spokesman Dave Bary observed the irony
that with modest and inevitable measures having been postponed,
Texas found itself this year staring down the barrel with even
tougher measures including reduced speed limits in D-FW and Houston
and morning restrictions on the use of heavy equipment and
gas-powered lawn mowers in the the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Austin, San Antonio, Tyler, Marshall and Longview are
on the verge of lifestyle changes themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission in May said
those metro areas were in non-attainment and would have to curb
ozone levels in undetermined ways. They are spared the EPA hammer
for now only because of a lack of sufficient information about
exactly how poor their air is. Until then, their Clean Air Act
status is recommended as ``unclassifiable'' by the TNRCC. The
commission says it means the state can get to work on cleaning up
those cities' air in advance of an EPA mandate.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA's Bary said it is not beyond possibility that in the
near future a greater swath of Texas _ for instance, other cities
along the I-35 corridor _ would be required to have tailpipes
checked.
</P>
<P>
   If current regional plans don't produce the desired effect, the
EPA could order Texas to adopt ``more stringent control
strategies.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds like an insistence on more action, less smoke.

an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

</P>
<P>
   Q: A report on the radio said there's a new treatment for
migraines. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: You probably heard about injections of Botox, a
muscle-relaxing agent used to remove lines and wrinkles in
patients' foreheads.
</P>
<P>
   Results of a study showing the serendipitous side effects on
migraines were presented in September by Dr. William Binder of UCLA
and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in California. The study was done
on 106 patients. Of those who had injections for wrinkles and who
also suffered from migraines, 60 percent experienced total relief
from their headaches for three to five months, the same amount of
time they experienced wrinkle relief.
</P>
<P>
   Studies are under way to determine if Botox should have FDA
approval for marketing as a migraine treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that so-called ``nonalcohol'' beer is brewed by
the same process as regular beer, and in fact does contain some
alcohol. Is it inadvisable for me to serve it to a friend who is a
recovering alcoholic?
</P>
<P>
   A: Recovering alcoholics should avoid such products ``to be on
the safe side,'' said Dr. Richard Fuller of the National Institute
on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   While admitting that he had no statistical evidence to support
his conclusion, Fuller said he based it on statements by alcoholics
that the ``nonalcohol'' beer tastes just like the more potent
beverage, and therefore ``elicited cravings for it.'' He added that
it's those cravings, perhaps as much as or more than the presence
of low amounts of alcohol, that pose potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   Although many people use the ``nonalcohol'' label for a beverage
such as O'Doul's, it does have a slight alcohol content: less than
0.5 percent by volume, according to its manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I remember reading that someone or some group was digging for
buried treasure around the Alamo. Was anything found?
</P>
<P>
   A: Nothing of significance. In the 50-day dig, in 1995,
archaeologists unearthed a cow horn, a knife-shaped piece of rusty
metal, animal bones, pottery shards and a coin-size copper object.
</P>
<P>
   Amateur historian Frank Buschbacher hoped the dig would locate
the legendary treasure of the San Saba mines. Buschbacher
apparently had been told by a Mexican mystic a decade earlier that
buried treasure could be found under the Alamo grounds. Buschbacher
theorized that Jim Bowie found silver along the hills of the San
Saba River and carried it to the Alamo. When Texans there were
attacked by Mexican forces, Bowie's men tossed the treasure into a
well.
</P>
<P>
   Buschbacher claimed not to be disappointed. ``We haven't lost
anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The archaeologists, meanwhile, found three sites they identified
as metal-bearing anomalies. The metal turned out to be high iron
content in rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it true that Marilyn Monroe had six toes on one of her
feet?
</P>
<P>
   A: That claim is made by former ``photographer to the stars''
Joseph Jasgur, 81, of Orlando. He spent most of six decades in
Hollywood photographing celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Jasgur was the first to do glossy shots of young Norma Jeane
Dougherty, who became Marilyn Monroe. He says he has the pictures
to prove that Norma Jeane _ the spelling she used on model release
forms she signed when he photographed her, and the spelling on her
birth certificate _ had six toes on her left foot. A report in the
Detroit News in 1992 said the abnormality was corrected later by
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article I read on the Internet said Hillary Rodham Clinton
(or her mother) is Jewish. Is this so?
</P>
<P>
   A: You could say there's a Jewish branch on her family tree, but
that's the extent of it.
</P>
<P>
   Max Rosenberg, the second husband of Clinton's maternal
grandmother, Della Howell, was a Russian-born Jew. Howell married
Rosenberg in 1933, seven years after she and Edwin Howell,
divorced. Clinton's mother, Dorothy, was born during the first
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Della and Max Rosenberg filed a petition for Max to adopt
Dorothy and Della's other children, but the attempt failed. Max
Rosenberg died in Los Angeles in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton, a Methodist, ``has very fond childhood
memories'' of Max Rosenberg, said Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for
Clinton's Senate campaign. Wolfson said he doesn't expect any
electoral impact to be derived because of Rosenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whom did Butch Harmon caddy for before he caddied for Tiger
Woods?
</P>
<P>
   A: Harmon is Woods' coach, not his caddy. You may be thinking of
the caddy change Woods made last year, when he jettisoned Mike
``Fluff'' Cowan in exchange for New Zealander Steve Williams.
Before Woods, Williams worked for Greg Norman (eight years), Ray
Floyd, Ian Baker-Finch and Waybe Grady.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My mother will be 94 soon. Can you repeat the information
about requesting greetings from the White House?
</P>
<P>
   A: Put the request in writing and mail to: The President,
Attention Greetings Office, Room 39, The White House, Washington,
DC 20500. Or fax it to 202-395-1232. To listen to recorded
information, call 202-456-2724 (press 2). A response will be sent
to the recipient 10 days prior to the event, according to the
recording.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I see where Delta Air Lines will be flying its new
twin-engine B-767-400 to Hawaii. I thought flights from the
mainland United States to Hawaii had to be operated by aircraft
with at least three engines. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Federal Aviation Administration permits airlines to
operate twin-engine aircraft on such over-water routes if they have
applied to the FAA and the application has been approved. The
applications are ``airline-specific, aircraft-specific and
route-specific,'' said agency spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen, so
there's no blanket authorization for any airline to operate any
twin-engine aircraft on any over-water route.
</P>
<P>
   In Delta's case with 767s to Hawaii, the authority has been
granted by the FAA. Airlines also have been operating 767s to
Europe, so there's precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Bergen said the FAA carefully monitors engine performance and
other factors after the airlines begin flying the twin-engine
planes on these routes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have the fires in Montana affected any of Ted Turner's
property?
</P>
<P>
   A: There was some damage to Turner's ``Bar None,'' a 23,000-acre
ranch near Toston. Turner publicist Maura Donlan said the fire was
contained within a perimeter covering about 7,000 acres, but not
everything within the area was damaged. Volunteer and paid
firefighters put it out.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is Socks, the White House cat, still around? How about Buddy,
the White House dog?
</P>
<P>
   A: They're both still residents of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in
Washington. The latest news is that they're answering mail. Well,
not them, but dozens of retired veterans who volunteer to respond
to the thousands of letters sent to the White House each day,
including many letters sent to Socks and Buddy.
</P>
<P>
   Since March 1993, when the White House asked for volunteers to
help respond to the mail, veterans from Washington's Soldiers' and
Airmens' Home have answered about 1.9 million letters _ 320,000 of
them for the Clinton family's pets.
</P>
<P>
   Recipients receive a portrait postcard from one or the other
signed with a pawprint at the bottom. The typical message: ``Thank
you for writing me. Living at the White House is exciting. I am
honored to be your `First Cat.' ''

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: At Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport security
checkpoint recently, my friend was asked for her purse. The guard
used a wand with a cloth attached to wipe the purse. Then she
placed the cloth in a machine. What is this procedure all about?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although Hartsfield officials refused to comment on specific
security procedures, others familiar with what your friend
encountered say the wand and machine are used to detect any
bomb-making materials that might have been present in her bag. The
wand is moved over the zipper and around the bag. If present,
traces of bomb-making materials would leave residue on the bag, so
the machine is used to detect any such materials.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recall some discussion about leasing Navy facilities in
Long Beach, Calif., to Chinese interests. What's the status of
that?
</P>
<P>
   A: It never happened. The Long Beach Naval Station had closed in
1994, and the Naval Shipyard shut down in 1997. The defunct complex
became part of the Port of Long Beach, and the city had planned to
lease the terminal to China Ocean Shipping Co., a major shipping
concern owned by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposed lease of the facilities was blocked in 1998 by
members of Congress who feared it would pose a threat to national
security. Two Republicans from Southern California, Reps. Duncan
Hunter and Randy Cunningham, first raised the security issue.
</P>
<P>
   The latest development came Aug. 10 when regulators from the
California Environmental Protection Agency and the Navy agreed on a
cleanup plan for the site.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article reported on rankings of the 50 states and District
of Columbia on SAT scores. Where on the Internet can I find
information about all states and their SAT scores?
</P>
<P>
   A: The College Board's results for all states can be found
online at www.collegeboard.org/sat/cbsenior/yr2000/states00.html.
But the College Board doesn't rank states ``nor does it have that
information available,'' said spokesman Henry Faulkner. ``There's a
lot of conjecture when anyone says how any states rank.''
</P>
<P>
   You can get an idea, however, if you check
www.collegeboard.org/press/senior00/html/000829.html and, in the
box at the right of your screen, click on Tables and Related Items.
Note the proviso at the top: ``Comparing or ranking states on the
basis of SAT scores along is invalid and strongly discouraged by
the College Board.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: A KLM jet dumped 83 tons of fuel over the Pacific when it had
to return to the Los Angeles airport Sunday after an engine part
fell off. What happens to that fuel?
</P>
<P>
   A: It normally vaporizes. Dumping is done to reduce the weight
of the airplane and to slow the landing speed, as well as to reduce
the risk of fire in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There was a 4-C draft classification in World War II. What
was it for?
</P>
<P>
   A: 4-C was for aliens or dual nationals. These are some of the
other classifications used between 1948 and 1976, when they ended:
1-A, available immediately for military service; 1-0 and 1-A-0,
conscientious objector; 2-A, job considered essential to the
national interest; 3-A, hardship deferment; 4-D, minister of
religion; 4-F, physically or mentally unable to serve; 5-A, over
age of liability for service.

<P>
   Q: What is the background of Jacques Nasser of Ford Motor Co.?
In the TV ads regarding the tire recall, his pronunciation seems
like a blend of Tidewater Virginia-Outer Banks North Carolina, Low
Country South Carolina, and Cajun, with a few words pronounced as
though he's direct from the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   A: His accent is considerably more global. Nasser, 52, Ford's
CEO and president, was born in Lebanon and raised in Melbourne,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   When he was barely 20, he accepted a job as a financial analyst
at Ford of Australia. He worked for the company in Thailand, the
Philippines, Venezuela and Argentina before returning in 1990 to
head Ford of Australia. Over the next three years he sliced the
15,000-person work force in half, earning him the nickname ``Jac
the Knife.''
</P>
<P>
   He became Ford's head of auto operations in the United States in
1996, and was elevated to CEO on Jan. 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   His 90-second TV ad guaranteeing that ``no one at Ford will rest
until every recalled tire is replaced'' premiered Aug. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A report mentioned that Asheville, N.C., ranks among Money
magazine's top 10 places to retire. What are the others?
</P>
<P>
   A: Bradenton, Fla.; Fort Collins, Colo.; Brunswick, Maine; and
Bend, Ore. Money's runners-up: Santa Fe, N.M.; Hot Springs, Ark.;
San Luis Obispo, Calif.; Madison, Wis.; and Amherst, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Information online: www.money.com/money/depts/retirement/. The
Web site, by the way, has information about housing costs, tax
rates, crime statistics and other retirement-pertinent factors in
nearly 500 U.S. cities and towns. Enter the name of the place
you're interested in, and the information is displayed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Everyone says Audie Murphy was the most decorated U.S.
soldier in World War II, but I think it was Neville Brand, who also
became an actor. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: Brand was one of the most decorated GIs in World War II, with
the Silver Star and seven Purple Hearts, among other medals. But he
didn't receive more than Murphy, according to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   It's generally considered that Murphy and Matt Urban were
America's most decorated soldiers, although a spokesman said the
Pentagon no longer lists anyone as having received ``the most''
medals, because it depends on which ones are counted.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Brand, who grew up in Kewanee, Ill., moved to Los
Angeles and attended the Geller Drama School on the GI Bill. His
first big break in movies came as a hoodlum in the 1950 thriller
``D.O.A.'' Among his other films: ``Stalag 17,'' ``Return From the
Sea,'' ``Riot in Cell Block 11'' and ``Birdman of Alcatraz.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand died at age 71 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A mentioned that Matt Urban was one of America's
most-decorated soldiers. Can you tell us more about him?
</P>
<P>
   A: Urban was awarded 29 medals for bravery during World War II,
including seven Purple Hearts _ one for each time he was wounded in
battle. At one time he was listed in the Guinness Book of World
Records as the most-decorated soldier in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   In wartime, Urban, an Army lieutenant colonel, was nicknamed
``The Ghost'' because of his sophisticated combat exploits. He led
his troops through campaigns in North Africa, Sicily, Belgium,
France and Germany. He later wrote ``The Matt Urban Story: Life and
World War II Experiences,'' and was awarded the Medal of Honor in
1980, 35 years after the original nomination was lost.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Urban lived in Michigan, where he died in March
1995 at age 75. A monument to his courage was unveiled in Holland,
Mich., in 1996.

</P>
<P>
   Q: A report on the radio said there's a new treatment for
migraines. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: You probably heard about injections of Botox, a
muscle-relaxing agent used to remove lines and wrinkles in
patients' foreheads.
</P>
<P>
   Results of a study showing the serendipitous side effects on
migraines were presented in September by Dr. William Binder of UCLA
and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in California. The study was done
on 106 patients. Of those who had injections for wrinkles and who
also suffered from migraines, 60 percent experienced total relief
from their headaches for three to five months, the same amount of
time they experienced wrinkle relief.
</P>
<P>
   Studies are under way to determine if Botox should have FDA
approval for marketing as a migraine treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that so-called ``nonalcohol'' beer is brewed by
the same process as regular beer, and in fact does contain some
alcohol. Is it inadvisable for me to serve it to a friend who is a
recovering alcoholic?
</P>
<P>
   A: Recovering alcoholics should avoid such products ``to be on
the safe side,'' said Dr. Richard Fuller of the National Institute
on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   While admitting that he had no statistical evidence to support
his conclusion, Fuller said he based it on statements by alcoholics
that the ``nonalcohol'' beer tastes just like the more potent
beverage, and therefore ``elicited cravings for it.'' He added that
it's those cravings, perhaps as much as or more than the presence
of low amounts of alcohol, that pose potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   Although many people use the ``nonalcohol'' label for a beverage
such as O'Doul's, it does have a slight alcohol content: less than
0.5 percent by volume, according to its manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I remember reading that someone or some group was digging for
buried treasure around the Alamo. Was anything found?
</P>
<P>
   A: Nothing of significance. In the 50-day dig, in 1995,
archaeologists unearthed a cow horn, a knife-shaped piece of rusty
metal, animal bones, pottery shards and a coin-size copper object.
</P>
<P>
   Amateur historian Frank Buschbacher hoped the dig would locate
the legendary treasure of the San Saba mines. Buschbacher
apparently had been told by a Mexican mystic a decade earlier that
buried treasure could be found under the Alamo grounds. Buschbacher
theorized that Jim Bowie found silver along the hills of the San
Saba River and carried it to the Alamo. When Texans there were
attacked by Mexican forces, Bowie's men tossed the treasure into a
well.
</P>
<P>
   Buschbacher claimed not to be disappointed. ``We haven't lost
anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The archaeologists, meanwhile, found three sites they identified
as metal-bearing anomalies. The metal turned out to be high iron
content in rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it true that Marilyn Monroe had six toes on one of her
feet?
</P>
<P>
   A: That claim is made by former ``photographer to the stars''
Joseph Jasgur, 81, of Orlando. He spent most of six decades in
Hollywood photographing celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Jasgur was the first to do glossy shots of young Norma Jeane
Dougherty, who became Marilyn Monroe. He says he has the pictures
to prove that Norma Jeane _ the spelling she used on model release
forms she signed when he photographed her, and the spelling on her
birth certificate _ had six toes on her left foot. A report in the
Detroit News in 1992 said the abnormality was corrected later by
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article I read on the Internet said Hillary Rodham Clinton
(or her mother) is Jewish. Is this so?
</P>
<P>
   A: You could say there's a Jewish branch on her family tree, but
that's the extent of it.
</P>
<P>
   Max Rosenberg, the second husband of Clinton's maternal
grandmother, Della Howell, was a Russian-born Jew. Howell married
Rosenberg in 1933, seven years after she and Edwin Howell,
divorced. Clinton's mother, Dorothy, was born during the first
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Della and Max Rosenberg filed a petition for Max to adopt
Dorothy and Della's other children, but the attempt failed. Max
Rosenberg died in Los Angeles in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton, a Methodist, ``has very fond childhood
memories'' of Max Rosenberg, said Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for
Clinton's Senate campaign. Wolfson said he doesn't expect any
electoral impact to be derived because of Rosenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whom did Butch Harmon caddy for before he caddied for Tiger
Woods?
</P>
<P>
   A: Harmon is Woods' coach, not his caddy. You may be thinking of
the caddy change Woods made last year, when he jettisoned Mike
``Fluff'' Cowan in exchange for New Zealander Steve Williams.
Before Woods, Williams worked for Greg Norman (eight years), Ray
Floyd, Ian Baker-Finch and Waybe Grady.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My mother will be 94 soon. Can you repeat the information
about requesting greetings from the White House?
</P>
<P>
   A: Put the request in writing and mail to: The President,
Attention Greetings Office, Room 39, The White House, Washington,
DC 20500. Or fax it to 202-395-1232. To listen to recorded
information, call 202-456-2724 (press 2). A response will be sent
to the recipient 10 days prior to the event, according to the
recording.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I see where Delta Air Lines will be flying its new
twin-engine B-767-400 to Hawaii. I thought flights from the
mainland United States to Hawaii had to be operated by aircraft
with at least three engines. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Federal Aviation Administration permits airlines to
operate twin-engine aircraft on such over-water routes if they have
applied to the FAA and the application has been approved. The
applications are ``airline-specific, aircraft-specific and
route-specific,'' said agency spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen, so
there's no blanket authorization for any airline to operate any
twin-engine aircraft on any over-water route.
</P>
<P>
   In Delta's case with 767s to Hawaii, the authority has been
granted by the FAA. Airlines also have been operating 767s to
Europe, so there's precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Bergen said the FAA carefully monitors engine performance and
other factors after the airlines begin flying the twin-engine
planes on these routes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have the fires in Montana affected any of Ted Turner's
property?
</P>
<P>
   A: There was some damage to Turner's ``Bar None,'' a 23,000-acre
ranch near Toston. Turner publicist Maura Donlan said the fire was
contained within a perimeter covering about 7,000 acres, but not
everything within the area was damaged. Volunteer and paid
firefighters put it out.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is Socks, the White House cat, still around? How about Buddy,
the White House dog?
</P>
<P>
   A: They're both still residents of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in
Washington. The latest news is that they're answering mail. Well,
not them, but dozens of retired veterans who volunteer to respond
to the thousands of letters sent to the White House each day,
including many letters sent to Socks and Buddy.
</P>
<P>
   Since March 1993, when the White House asked for volunteers to
help respond to the mail, veterans from Washington's Soldiers' and
Airmens' Home have answered about 1.9 million letters _ 320,000 of
them for the Clinton family's pets.
</P>
<P>
   Recipients receive a portrait postcard from one or the other
signed with a pawprint at the bottom. The typical message: ``Thank
you for writing me. Living at the White House is exciting. I am
honored to be your `First Cat.' ''

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: At Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport security
checkpoint recently, my friend was asked for her purse. The guard
used a wand with a cloth attached to wipe the purse. Then she
placed the cloth in a machine. What is this procedure all about?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although Hartsfield officials refused to comment on specific
security procedures, others familiar with what your friend
encountered say the wand and machine are used to detect any
bomb-making materials that might have been present in her bag. The
wand is moved over the zipper and around the bag. If present,
traces of bomb-making materials would leave residue on the bag, so
the machine is used to detect any such materials.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recall some discussion about leasing Navy facilities in
Long Beach, Calif., to Chinese interests. What's the status of
that?
</P>
<P>
   A: It never happened. The Long Beach Naval Station had closed in
1994, and the Naval Shipyard shut down in 1997. The defunct complex
became part of the Port of Long Beach, and the city had planned to
lease the terminal to China Ocean Shipping Co., a major shipping
concern owned by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposed lease of the facilities was blocked in 1998 by
members of Congress who feared it would pose a threat to national
security. Two Republicans from Southern California, Reps. Duncan
Hunter and Randy Cunningham, first raised the security issue.
</P>
<P>
   The latest development came Aug. 10 when regulators from the
California Environmental Protection Agency and the Navy agreed on a
cleanup plan for the site.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article reported on rankings of the 50 states and District
of Columbia on SAT scores. Where on the Internet can I find
information about all states and their SAT scores?
</P>
<P>
   A: The College Board's results for all states can be found
online at www.collegeboard.org/sat/cbsenior/yr2000/states00.html.
But the College Board doesn't rank states ``nor does it have that
information available,'' said spokesman Henry Faulkner. ``There's a
lot of conjecture when anyone says how any states rank.''
</P>
<P>
   You can get an idea, however, if you check
www.collegeboard.org/press/senior00/html/000829.html and, in the
box at the right of your screen, click on Tables and Related Items.
Note the proviso at the top: ``Comparing or ranking states on the
basis of SAT scores along is invalid and strongly discouraged by
the College Board.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: A KLM jet dumped 83 tons of fuel over the Pacific when it had
to return to the Los Angeles airport Sunday after an engine part
fell off. What happens to that fuel?
</P>
<P>
   A: It normally vaporizes. Dumping is done to reduce the weight
of the airplane and to slow the landing speed, as well as to reduce
the risk of fire in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There was a 4-C draft classification in World War II. What
was it for?
</P>
<P>
   A: 4-C was for aliens or dual nationals. These are some of the
other classifications used between 1948 and 1976, when they ended:
1-A, available immediately for military service; 1-0 and 1-A-0,
conscientious objector; 2-A, job considered essential to the
national interest; 3-A, hardship deferment; 4-D, minister of
religion; 4-F, physically or mentally unable to serve; 5-A, over
age of liability for service.

<P>
   Q: What is the background of Jacques Nasser of Ford Motor Co.?
In the TV ads regarding the tire recall, his pronunciation seems
like a blend of Tidewater Virginia-Outer Banks North Carolina, Low
Country South Carolina, and Cajun, with a few words pronounced as
though he's direct from the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   A: His accent is considerably more global. Nasser, 52, Ford's
CEO and president, was born in Lebanon and raised in Melbourne,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   When he was barely 20, he accepted a job as a financial analyst
at Ford of Australia. He worked for the company in Thailand, the
Philippines, Venezuela and Argentina before returning in 1990 to
head Ford of Australia. Over the next three years he sliced the
15,000-person work force in half, earning him the nickname ``Jac
the Knife.''
</P>
<P>
   He became Ford's head of auto operations in the United States in
1996, and was elevated to CEO on Jan. 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   His 90-second TV ad guaranteeing that ``no one at Ford will rest
until every recalled tire is replaced'' premiered Aug. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A report mentioned that Asheville, N.C., ranks among Money
magazine's top 10 places to retire. What are the others?
</P>
<P>
   A: Bradenton, Fla.; Fort Collins, Colo.; Brunswick, Maine; and
Bend, Ore. Money's runners-up: Santa Fe, N.M.; Hot Springs, Ark.;
San Luis Obispo, Calif.; Madison, Wis.; and Amherst, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Information online: www.money.com/money/depts/retirement/. The
Web site, by the way, has information about housing costs, tax
rates, crime statistics and other retirement-pertinent factors in
nearly 500 U.S. cities and towns. Enter the name of the place
you're interested in, and the information is displayed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Everyone says Audie Murphy was the most decorated U.S.
soldier in World War II, but I think it was Neville Brand, who also
became an actor. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: Brand was one of the most decorated GIs in World War II, with
the Silver Star and seven Purple Hearts, among other medals. But he
didn't receive more than Murphy, according to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   It's generally considered that Murphy and Matt Urban were
America's most decorated soldiers, although a spokesman said the
Pentagon no longer lists anyone as having received ``the most''
medals, because it depends on which ones are counted.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Brand, who grew up in Kewanee, Ill., moved to Los
Angeles and attended the Geller Drama School on the GI Bill. His
first big break in movies came as a hoodlum in the 1950 thriller
``D.O.A.'' Among his other films: ``Stalag 17,'' ``Return From the
Sea,'' ``Riot in Cell Block 11'' and ``Birdman of Alcatraz.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand died at age 71 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A mentioned that Matt Urban was one of America's
most-decorated soldiers. Can you tell us more about him?
</P>
<P>
   A: Urban was awarded 29 medals for bravery during World War II,
including seven Purple Hearts _ one for each time he was wounded in
battle. At one time he was listed in the Guinness Book of World
Records as the most-decorated soldier in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   In wartime, Urban, an Army lieutenant colonel, was nicknamed
``The Ghost'' because of his sophisticated combat exploits. He led
his troops through campaigns in North Africa, Sicily, Belgium,
France and Germany. He later wrote ``The Matt Urban Story: Life and
World War II Experiences,'' and was awarded the Medal of Honor in
1980, 35 years after the original nomination was lost.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Urban lived in Michigan, where he died in March
1995 at age 75. A monument to his courage was unveiled in Holland,
Mich., in 1996.

   PLASTIC _ Remember when mere mention of the word plastic evoked
images of cheap stuff? A formal dinner served with _ gasp _ plastic
knives and forks. An English garden strewn with plastic lawn
chairs. A weathered tombstone adorned with plastic roses. Not
anymore. These days, plastics are commanding a level of respect _
and often high prices _ that's earning them a spot in even homes on
the right side of the track. ``Better plastics are available today,
and people are finally realizing you can mix them with pieces from
the entire 20th century,'' said Scott Reilly of retromodern.com, at
Atlanta retailer that specializes in plastic furnishings and
accessories.(Flanders, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.)

&HT;     CARROTS DON'T HAVE TO BE BOILED INTO OBLIVION 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometime before people become grown-ups, carrots go from being a
wonderfully sweet and crunchy snack to a vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   Cut into circles and boiled until soft, carrots are about as
appealing as a root canal. Shaped into little cubes and combined
with some mealy peas to be canned or frozen, they're even worse.
And that's a shame because carrots are healthful, versatile and, if
not boiled into mush, a sweet counterpart to green vegetables that
are even less popular, such as peas and broccoli.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, carrots were just about every color in the food
realm except orange, write cookbook authors Jeannette Ferrary and
Louise Fiszer, on Sally's Place, a culinary Web site
(http://www.sallys-place.com). They were red, black, yellow, white
and purple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally cultivated in Afghanistan in the 7th century,
carrots originally had purple exteriors and yellow flesh. In the
Middle Ages, the Dutch developed the bright orange carrot we now
know as the bearer of carotene,'' they write.
</P>
<P>
   Around 1900, people finally settled on orange carrots, says Paul
Arnold, who grows carrots of many colors at Pleasant Valley Farm in
Argyle, N.Y. ``I think the other colors may have gotten pushed
aside because some of them aren't machine-harvestable and
therefore, they didn't have as much value.''
</P>
<P>
   With the resurgence of farmers markets and small farms, colorful
carrots are making a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold sells the orange, purple and white carrots he grows at
the farmers markets in the upstate New York communities of Saratoga
Springs, Glens Falls and Queensbury. He says he has seen interest
in the off-hued vegetables increase in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do our customers really enjoy seeing the different
kinds, they come back and want them because of the flavor,'' Arnold
says. ``They have a stronger flavor than commercially grown
carrots.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrots contain a substantial amount of beta carotene, which is
one of the antioxidant nutrients associated with the prevention of
some cancers. During digestion, beta carotene is converted to
vitamin A, a nutrient necessary for proper bone growth, healthy
skin and hair, tooth development and eyesight. In addition, carrots
have only 35 calories per 1-cup serving.
</P>
<P>
   While carrots seem to be relegated to a supporting role in
vegetables mixtures, salads and crudite plates these days, the root
vegetable was quite popular in other times. Early New Englanders
gave carrot cookies as Christmas gifts and ``tzimmes'' a sweet
carrot stew, is traditional for the Jewish New Year, write Ferrary
and Louise Fiszer.
</P>
<P>
   When cooking carrots, use as little liquid as possible, writes
James Peterson in ``Vegetables'' (Morrow, 1998) because the liquid
draws out the root's natural flavors and sweetness. If you must
boil carrots, try to use the liquid in the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Since carrots are fatter at one end, sliced carrots tend to cook
unevenly. To prevent this, cut the larger circles into wedges
before using.
</P>
<P>
   When buying carrots, look for well-shaped roots and brightly
colored vegetables. If sold with the tops still attached, look for
fresh greens. Cut the tops off before storing in a tightly sealed
plastic bag in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Carrots will keep for up to a month in a plastic bag and in the
refrigerator. To store up to two months, add a damp paper towel to
the bag.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a root cellar, you can keep fresh carrots through
the winter, says Arnold. ``Keep them between 33 and 35 degrees and
at 100 percent humidity. That's what they like.''
</P>
<P>
   The following recipes are from ``Generation to Generation: A
Celebration of the Senses'' compiled by Congregation Agudat Achim
in Schenectady, N.Y.

&HT;     PUTTING A NEW, MORE COLORFUL FACE ON MAKEUP 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Never has retro makeup been such a complement to
the return of elegance in fashion as it has this fall. The '50s
live on faces that have long been void of color and form.
</P>
<P>
   While the neutral/natural/beige look is a style that Calvin
Klein clings to, it is not strong enough for fall's jewel-toned
gowns, black and white suitings, or the sharp, womanly tailoring
that glorifies a female's best assets.
</P>
<P>
   If you are not a fan of well-defined red lips and strong,
shapely eyebrows, then maybe you'd better sit this one out. Better
yet ... find a red lipstick that works for you. Everyone can wear
red lips ... if they find the right shade. It has to do with the
undertones of your skin. (Everyone has a little yellow in their
skin; some women are tawnier, some are pinker.)
</P>
<P>
   How do you determine what color is the real you? Rule of thumb:
If you look great in paper white shirts next to your face, chances
are you have some pink in your skin. You'd be considered a ``cool''
color person. The lipstick for you: Reds with a little blue in
them, like Chanel's new ``Calypso'' _ maybe slicked up with a
highlight of ``Pulsar Glossimer'' or YSL's new ``No. 82 Rouge
Pur,'' a lipstick so vividly blue-red, it is designed to wear with
black velvet and diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   If creamy colored off-white shirts make your skin glow, you
probably have a lot of gold or yellow in your skin. Then, a true,
clear red or a brown-red works _ or even a red with a little bit of
yellow, like M.A.C's new ``Lady Danger,'' Lauder's ``Fiery
Russett'' or YSL's ``Copyright Red'' (``No. 83 Rouge Pur'').
</P>
<P>
   Bright red lips put you off? Try a milder form, like a gloss or
a lipstain from Bobbie Brown, Frederic Fekkai or Laura Mercier.
</P>
<P>
   As for the eyes: They start with a great brow. Not pared down as
much as groomed within an inch of its life. The best way to
accomplish a great brow is to have it done professionally. Alexis
Simonsen at Saks Fifth Avenue's YSL counter, Angelina Umansky of
Spa Radiance, Robert Williams at Saks' Franois Nars counter _ all
do very strong, flattering brows.
</P>
<P>
   A great way to groom a brow: Select a small, slant-edged brush
and brow powder (YSL, Chanel and Lancome have brow compacts with
several colors in them so you can mix up just the right shade.) Run
the brush lightly over the surface of the brow powder, tapping off
the excess. Sketch in your brows, brushing the color in the
direction your brow grows, using tiny, short strokes. Anchor into
place with either a clear brow fixative or with transparent mascara
(Calvin Klein makes one; so does Max Factor). When you get your
brows where you want them, and while the brow fix is still damp,
take a piece of tissue and blot your brows as you would your
lipstick to remove the excess.
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer using a brow pencil, T. LeClerc's ``Crayon de
Sourcils'' in brownish taupe (one end is pencil, the other is a
brow brush) is a good universal color that will work for blondes as
well as brunettes and redheads. A third option is Shiseido's
lightly tinted brow fixative (Macy's).
</P>
<P>
   Under a strong brow, there needs to be an elegant eye but
nothing that will compete with the mouth. The '50s ballerina eye
with its strong, winged black eyeliner, is enough with possibly a
color wash of the lightest dove gray, taupe or even ice blue _ so
delicately applied, you can hardly see it. False eyelashes have
made a strong return, but not for the entire eye. Try Lancome's
individual eyelashes, applied to the outside corner of the top row
of lashes. Mascara: Good, dark, deep black, even on blondes.
</P>
<P>
   As for the cheeks _ shine is out. No glitter, no glitz, no
little mica sparkles. Just a blush accomplished with any number of
the face tints available, including the original: ``BeneTint'' by
BeneFit and the recent copies by Francois Nars and Lancome. (One
word of warning: This stuff requires some rehearsal before you
start to dress for the evening. Get it, play with hit until you're
applying it like a pro.)
</P>
<P>
   Better yet: Have a makeup lesson. The festive fall face is
fairly simple to accomplish. Once you know how.

<TEXT>
<P>
   According to Niccolo Machiavelli's classic manual of
realpolitik, ``The Prince,'' a prince ought not to be religious,
but should be adept at simulating religiosity. It would come as
something of a relief in this year's god-bothered American election
campaign if it turned out that when the various candidates profess
their various degrees of spiritual devotion, they don't really mean
it. If they were just trying to look good in the eyes of the
notoriously religious American electorate, one might almost be able
to forgive them their protestations. To be cynical is merely to be
a politician, after all, and cynicism is, anyhow, greatly
preferable to sanctimony.
</P>
<P>
   No such luck, I'm afraid. Bill Clinton may very well be the most
devout of believers, but the sheer enthusiasm and frequency with
which he has confessed his sins, the brilliant volubility and
star-quality performance of his fallen-sinner-sees-the-light act,
has elevated the belief practices of the Leader to the level of
major showbiz. His successors, none of them blessed (or cursed)
with the fabled Clintonian charisma and pizazz, have no option but
to say what they mean, which means, unfortunately, that they also
mean what they say.
</P>
<P>
   The truly Machiavellian candidate would, for example, have noted
the opinion polls that followed the announcement of Al Gore's
selection of Sen. Joe Lieberman for the second spot on the Democrat
ticket. This American Machiavelli _ spotting that while more than
90 percent of eligible voters said they had no difficulty in
imagining themselves voting for a black, Jewish or gay presidential
candidate, only half of them were willing to consider voting for an
atheist _ would instantly pump up the spiritual volume, and if he
wasn't already adept at feigning a deeply held faith, he would make
darn sure he learned how to do so double quick.
</P>
<P>
   So here, right on cue, comes Lieberman himself, hauling George
Washington out of his grave to cry that where there is no religion
there can be no morality. But while Lieberman may be many things,
he is no Machiavelli, as is amply demonstrated by the two-left-feet
clumsiness of this attempt to make religion even more important an
issue in American public life than it already is. After the
Anti-Defamation League's attack on his remarks, he's been
backtracking fast. So now he's all for the separation of church and
state, always was, always will be, and no, he doesn't think that
people without religious belief lack moral conviction, even though
he did raise poor old George from the dead to say exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   All this is alarming to those of us (the citizens of the rest of
the world) who are not entitled to vote in November, but whose fate
will be profoundly influenced by the choice of U.S. voters. We're
already pretty disconcerted by the thought that only about 30
percent of American voters think it's worth bothering to cast a
vote at all, and the notion that the relative perceived holiness of
the candidates may become an issue of decisive importance does
nothing to reassure us that the choice will be responsibly made.
</P>
<P>
   In John Frankenheimer's classic 1960s thriller ``The Manchurian
Candidate,'' America's enemies try to seize control of the White
House by getting a brainwashed Laurence Harvey to run for
president. Today, even friends of the United States are beginning
to think it might be a good idea for a Rest-of-the-World candidate
to be permitted to run. After all, in this age of the pax
Americana, when we all live under the aegis of the American
Empire's unchallenged might, the victorious candidate will be our
president, too.
</P>
<P>
   Of the actually available duo, it's plain that the Rest of the
World's best bet is Al Gore. Not only is he smarter than his
opponent, he also does appear to know where the Rest of the World
is, which gives him a definite edge in our admittedly
self-interested opinion. For many of us, George W. Bush's failure
to name the president of India was a mistake as irredeemable as Dan
Quayle's ``potatoe.'' For many more of us, Bush's fondness for
executing his fellow human beings is also a reason for unease. If
it was tough to forgive Clinton for executing a mentally retarded
man, it's even tougher to accept George W.'s regular
lethal-injection sprees.
</P>
<P>
   It seems a shame, then, that the sidekick chosen by Gore to
prove he was ``his own man'' should turn out to be a bit of a moral
dinosaur. Lieberman's attack on the movies in the name of ``the
family'' should have been a straw in the wind. Neither this, nor
his use of Washington as a ventriloquist's dummy, will be any
easier to forget than Bush's ignorance of President K.R.
Narayanan's name.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore urgently needs to remind his running mate that people
can be moral without being godly for the simple reason that
morality precedes ideology _ religion is a way of organizing our
ideas about good and evil, and not necessarily the origin of those
ideas. And to mention to Lieberman also that the Rest of the World
would like him to be a little less of a klutz.

<P>
   Tom Clancy's latest thriller, ``The Bear and the Dragon,'' is a
work in progress _ for the reader, who has to plow through 1,028
pages and subplot upon subplot. However, G.P. Putnam's Sons has
made it a real bargain by pricing it at only $28.95.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Ryan is now the duly elected president and faces big
problems on the world stage. In Russia, assassins use a
rocket-launched grenade to take out a white Mercedes carrying a key
Moscow mafioso.
</P>
<P>
   However, many think the assassins got the wrong Mercedes and
really meant to take out Sergey Nikolaych Golovko, the head of the
state security service, formerly the KGB. FBI agent Mike Reilly,
assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and an expert on organized
crime, helps the local officers in their investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ryan has angered the mainland Chinese by granting
independent-nation status to Taiwan. Trade talks are going badly
because Beijing will not open its markets to American business, is
ripping off foreign technology and refuses to discuss what the
United States considers human-rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   Having spent billions to build up their army and navy, the
Chinese are facing bankruptcy and are drawing up plans for an
invasion of Siberia, where huge oil and gold fields have been
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, when a Chinese woman trying to get around the
one-child rule goes into labor, a doctor tries to abort the child.
Her husband calls their Baptist minister begging for help.
</P>
<P>
   The minister and the newly named papal nuncio to China rush to
the hospital and try to stop the abortion, but both are killed,
setting off a huge wave of anti-Chinese sentiment around the world
because the Chinese refuse to issue a public apology.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans get their first break when a young CIA agent woos
the secretary of one of the Chinese politburo members and installs
a secret device in her computer that automatically sends notes on
her boss's meetings to the CIA. Thus, the CIA gets early warning
about the Chinese plans.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the best Clancy thriller. It is overwritten and very
racist, and no writer should make his reader work so hard _ I
almost made a flow chart to keep the story straight.
</P>
<P>
   This is a real shame because there is a very good story buried
in ``The Bear and the Dragon.'' However, since the book is already
at the top of the bestseller lists, Clancy will have no worries.
His hard-core fans will buy it even though they deserve better.

   ``Pagan Babies.'' By Elmore Leonard. Delacorte Press. $24.95.
263 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard's latest crime thriller should be accompanied by a CD
with Andy Williams singing ``Two grifters, out to con the world,
there's such a lot of world to con '' With apologies to Henry
Mancini, Leonard, as usual, has hit a winner with ``Pagan Babies.''
</P>
<P>
   He begins his tale in Rwanda. Five years ago, the Rev. Terry
Dunne left Detroit and went to Rwanda to help his ailing uncle, a
priest in a small village. As Terry says Mass one Sunday, Hutus
enter his church and massacre 70 of his congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Terry never gets over the horror of that morning. He says Mass
on Christmas and Easter and hears confessions once a week, but
mostly, he sits on his porch and drinks Johnny Walker Red with his
housekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Then his brother Fran, a lawyer, calls to say that their mother
has died. As he prepares to leave for home, one of the Hutus who
participated in the church massacre brags that the killings will
begin again. So Terry takes his housekeeper's gun, goes to the
local banana beer bar and fatally shoots the Hutu and three of his
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Terry gets back to Detroit too late for the funeral, but in time
to meet up with a local prosecutor to discuss his possible
indictment for smuggling illegal cigarettes across state lines
before he left Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Fran introduces Terry to Debbie Dewey, a former personal injury
investigator and would-be stand-up comic who has just finished
serving three years for aggravated assault after she ran down her
former lover, who conned her out of her savings.
</P>
<P>
   Street-smart Debbie knows instantly that Terry is no priest and
is probably a fellow con-artist. She convinces him to help her get
her ex-lover, Randy, to repay the money he swindled from her.
</P>
<P>
   Her plan will get her money back and raise money for the orphans
of Rwanda. The two set up a con that uses the local mob bosses to
outfox Randy.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard peoples ``Pagan Babies'' with his usual assortment of
low-lifes, off-the wall dialogue and a plot that will keep you
guessing.
</P>
<P>
   And the title is a hoot. For years, Catholic grade school kids
were given Pagan Baby boxes. When they saved up $5, they took the
box back to school and got to give a Christian name to a pagan baby
for his baptism.
</P>
<P>
   Only Leonard would be crazy enough to use this barbaric premise
for the basis of a truly unique novel.

   ``Stalker.'' By Faye Kellerman. William Morrow. $25. 406 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Kellerman's latest in the Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus mystery
series focuses on his daughter, Los Angeles police Officer Cynthia
Decker, a redhead with an attitude that does not go down well with
her fellow officers.
</P>
<P>
   She can't help giving the impression that she is better than
everyone else because she has an Ivy League education and her
father is a lieutenant in the department.
</P>
<P>
   After antagonizing her immediate superior by disobeying orders
while trying to halt a domestic dispute, Cindy gets the feeling
that someone is following her. She finds things out of place in her
apartment; then her apartment is vandalized. She gets support from
Detective Scott Oliver, who works for her father.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver and his boss are investigating a string of carjackings
that may be tied to the murder of a tycoon Cindy knew. She starts
investigating the murder, placing herself in great peril.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy is a cocky, smug, arrogant, very intriguing character. It
will be interesting to see where Kellerman takes her in future
mysteries. ``Stalker'' is a pleasant read with good characters,
well-developed plot and realistic dialogue.

   ``Even Steven.'' By John Gilstrap. Pocket Books. $24.95. 357
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Gilstrap has produced an incredibly original
thriller centered around a child in peril.
</P>
<P>
   When Susan and Bobby Martin's baby is born dead, they are
devastated. They go camping in West Virginia hoping to heal the
emotional wounds that haunt them both. Suddenly, they hear rustling
in the bushes and think it's a bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Squealing like a frightened pig, the beast bolted out of the
trees, coming straight at Bobby, then breaking off to the right,
across the rocks toward the river. Only it wasn't a bear. `Oh, my
God!' Susan yelled. `It's a little boy!' And he was scared to
death. Screaming, he ran in a blind panic toward the edge of the
rocks, and the rolling waters below.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby takes off after him and grabs the child before he plunges
into the river. About 3 years old, the boy is wearing only a pair
of footy pajamas, and he is caked with dirt. Susan eventually
quiets the crying child as they decide to take him to the nearest
ranger station in hopes of finding his parents.
</P>
<P>
   Before they can act, they hear more rustling in the trees. A man
appears and says he is looking for his son. When Bobby doesn't
appear to believe his story, the man pulls a gun on him, a fight
ensues and Bobby eventually kills the man. Checking for
identification, they discover the dead man is a cop. In a panic,
they flee the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, April Simpson returns home from work and learns her
son has been taken because her husband owes a drug dealer a lot of
money. Simpson enlists the help of another drug dealer to get her
son back. She also tries a hold-up that lands her in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Page by page, the tension mounts. Will the Martins' marriage
survive Susan's refusal to give up the child? Will Simpson be able
to get the police involved in finding her son?
</P>
<P>
   Gilstrap is a unique storyteller, with a crisp writing style, a
fine eye for detail and an obvious love of children. Once again,
Gilstrap delivers.

   NIXON-BIOGRAPHY-EXCERPT1 _ Outwardly Pat Nixon gave every
indication that she was the perfect politician's wife. Inwardly,
however, she was miserable: she hated public life and campaigning.
Richard Nixon was cold and dismissive toward her, and associates
never saw any signs of affection. This excerpt describes their
troubled relationship, punctuated by accounts of abuse, on occasion
allegedly physical. 1,100 words. NORTH AMERICAN RIGHTS ONLY.
</P>
<P>
   NIXON-BIOGRAPHY-EXCERPT2 _ This excerpt describes how winning
the preidency changed Richard Nixon. He lavishly redecorated the
White House living quarters, and set up nine separate offices, all
with expensive communication systems, yet kept a very leisurely
work schedule. As former Republican Party chairman Len Hall put it,
Nixon became ``regal, kinglike. ... He loved power, power to sit in
the Oval Office and just issue orders. ...'' 1,100 words. NORTH
AMERICAN RIGHTS ONLY.
</P>

   NIXON-BIOGRAPHY-EXCERPT3 _ This excerpt describes how, in 1968,
the founder of the Dreyfus Fund gave Richard Nixon a large quantity
of the prescription drug Dilantin, which Nixon began taking without
a doctor's supervision. In 1974, as his presidencey deteriorated,
Mr. Summers recounts how Nixon's aides and advisers took steps to
ensure that an increasingly erratic president didn't compromise
national security. 1,100 words. NORTH AMERICAN RIGHTS ONLY.

 &HT;    c. 2000 Anthony Summers   
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (In his book Mr. Summers describes a troubled relationship
between Pat and Richard Nixon, punctuated by accounts of abuse, on
occasion allegedly physical.)
</P>
<P>
   Evlyn Dorn, Nixon's longtime secretary, saw her boss reach out
to touch his wife's hand only once _ and then merely to steady her
as they stood in the back of a car. ``He had a way of ignoring
her,'' she said. ``I never saw him touch Pat's hand,'' recalled Tom
Dixon, a broadcaster who acted as an aide during elections in the
late forties. ``I have never seen quite so cold an arrangement.''
...
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never, ever, ever, ever any sign of affection
whatsoever,'' recalled Kandy Stroud, who specialized in covering
Pat for Women's Wear Daily. ``I rode in the limousine with them,
the first time I was alone with them together. He did all the
talking, she did none. She just sat there ... like a staff member
... the entire ride and he didn't refer to her, or defer to her.''
...
</P>
<P>
   The damage from Richard Nixon's loss in the 1960 presidential
election went beyond politics. In 1961, journalists in search of a
``human interest story'' got more than they bargained for. On the
day the moving van was being loaded for the family's return to
California, Pat suddenly came rushing out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   She was ``screaming like a banshee,'' recalled Washington Daily
News reporter Tom Kelly, ``completely out of control. Her hair was
disheveled, her face red, and her eyes were wild.'' Kelly and an
Associated Press colleague quickly discovered that it was they who
were the targets of Pat's rage. She stood cursing them, claiming
that a hostile press had caused her husband's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   This was a Pat the public had never seen, a Pat embittered by
the experience of the previous year. ``I've given up everything I
loved,'' she had said even before the campaign, referring to the
loss of privacy and family time. Other intimates noted that much of
Pat's rage was directed against her husband, the husband who had
ignored her appeals to quit politics. ...
</P>
<P>
   There are varying versions of her reactions during dinner at a
restaurant in late September 1961, the night Nixon publicly
announced he would run for California governor. Future cabinet
member Bob Finch's wife, Carol, recalled Pat's saying suddenly,
``I'm trapped. Which way can I go?'' ...
</P>
<P>
   But in public Pat acted out her role, telling reporters, ``Our
hearts are in politics and we are glad to be back in the thick of
it.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Watching as she went through the motions, the Los Angeles
Times's Richard Bergholz thought her ``just a stick of furniture
sitting there ... she was obviously on edge. He abused her
perpetually.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Word spread about an ugly moment during a plane trip from San
Francisco (during the 1962 California governor's race, which he
lost to Pat Brown by 297,000). Pat, sitting apart from her husband
while he talked with others, had asked if she might join them for a
drink. The answer, reportedly was a snarled, ``Keep you f---ing
mouth shut.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   In the blur of Nixon's defeat, when he was drunk in his suite at
the Beverly Hilton, aides were preoccupied with preventing him
going downstairs. Pat reportedly sat alone, sobbing quietly in an
adjoining room. ...
</P>
<P>
   Future cabinet member Bob Finch, Nixon's intimate for many
years, once admitted cautiously that he had sometimes witnessed
Nixon in a rage, a rage ``irrational in that it was much broader
than the incident that provided it.'' Speechwriter William Safire
would write of Nixon's capacity of ``deep, dark rage.'' Pat had a
temper too. ...
</P>
<P>
   Rumors that that Nixon had physically abused Pat circulated in
Washington for years. Two investigative reporters stumbled on such
stories, but none were at the time well enough sourced to publish.
While writing ``The Final Days'' with Carl Bernstein, their account
of the end of the Nixon presidency, Bob Woodward was told of an
incident in which Nixon supposedly hurt his wife badly enough to
put her in the hospital. Seymour Hersh, while working on his study
of Henry Kissinger, ``The Price of Power,'' was told by sources of
three alleged wife-beating incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after resigning the presidency, Hersh was told, Nixon
attacked Pat at their home in San Clemente. According to the
source, she had to be taken to a nearby emergency room. The doctor
who treated her corroborated the story. The most compelling account
of such abuse, however, relates to the 1962 defeat and comes from
several sources. Governor Pat Brown said years later, ``We got word
at one stage of the campaign that he kicked the hell out of her,
hit her.''
</P>
<P>
   A former Los Angeles area reporter, Bill Van Petten, years later
told a friend, the writer Jon Ewing, of his experiences while
covering the gubernatorial campaign. Nixon, he said, had been a
``terrible, belligerent drunk, mean when drunk, and would become
obnoxious at night when in hotels on the road.''...
</P>
<P>
   (After the defeat) Nixon ``beat Pat badly ... so badly that she
could not go out the next day. ``This had happened before,'' Van
Petten was told, ``and aides like Haldeman, Robert Finch, or
Ehrlichman would on occasion have to go in and intervene. On this
particular night there was a lot of commotion at an ungodly hour,
and one or some of the aides had to run in and pull him off Pat.
She had bruises on her face. Everyone was shaken up.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   First credible corroboration of the 1962 beating allegation was
provided during the writing of this book by John Sears, a former
Nixon aide who went on to political distinction. ... He was to be a
key figure in the Nixon comeback in 1968 and would join the Nixon
White House as a political strategist under Ehrlichman.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he met the couple, Sears recalled in a 1997
interview, the marriage seemed to him ``peculiar.'' ... Then Sears
related what he had learned of Nixon's physical abuse. ``The family
lawyer told me that Nixon had hit her in 1962 and that she had
threatened to leave him over it. ... I'm not talking about a smack.
He blackened her eye. ... I had heard about that from Pat Hillings
(a longtime Nixon friend and associate) as well ...'' Sears
identified the ``lawyer'' as the late Waller Taylor, who in 1962
had been a senior partner at Adams, Duque and Hazeltine, the firm
Nixon had joined after his defeat by John F. Kennedy. ... According
to Taylor, divorce was discussed at this time. ...
</P>
<P>
   In her memoir of her mother, Julie Nixon recalled how the day
after the 1962 election ended, ``Mother lay on her bed, the room
darkened by closed shutters, and cried in front of us for the first
time we could remember. Tricia and I sat on the floor by the bed
and cried also.'' That evening close family friends took both the
Nixon daughters away to their home for a few days. ``When we
returned,'' said Julie, ``my parents seemed fine.'' But ``There was
a sadness,'' as Tricia told Nixon himself later when he asked for
her teen-age memories of the 1962 race, ``and the sadness went on
for years.''

Nixon became ``regal, kinglike. ... He loved power, power to sit in
the Oval Office and just issue orders. ...'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you dare call me Dick. I am the president of the United
States. When you speak to me you call me Mr. President.'' So
commanded Nixon, early in the presidency, at a meeting with Florida
banker Hoke Maroon, a man he had known for years. ``He was as
obsessed with the office as any president has ever been,'' his old
friend Bob Finch ruefully recalled. ``He gloried in it, night and
day.''
</P>
<P>
   The outward signs were quickly obvious. Before the Nixons moved
into the White House, the message they had conveyed to the public
was that it did not need refurbishing. That soon changed, however,
and a massive remodeling program, costing millions, began.
</P>
<P>
   Military planes were dispatched to Italy to bring back green
watered silk for just one medium-size room. An ornate four-poster
bed for Nixon cost six thousand dollars, its draperies ten
thousand. The next presidential couple to occupy the White House,
the Fords, thought it unbelievable, ``something Marie Antoinette
would have slept in,'' and promptly had it removed.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Lyndon Johnson had maintained three Boeing passenger
jets, Nixon had three Boeings, eleven Lockheed Jetstars, and
sixteen helicopters at his exclusive disposal. The existing Air
Force One was refurbished at a cost of $800,000, with the emphasis
on the First Family's accommodation. Later, when a new plane was
delivered _ with a layout the Nixons did not like _ another
$750,000 went toward the alterations.
</P>
<P>
   The fleet was not used solely for government business. Nixon's
extended family, including in-laws, availed themselves of the
planes. When a troubled official reported that senior aides were
taking Air Force One on transcontinental flights to and from
vacations, Nixon signed off on them. An Air Force Jetstar was once
used to ferry a package from Florida to Camp David for senior
aides, at a cost of five thousand dollars in fuel alone. Its
contents: ten pounds of crabs from Joe's Stone Crabs in Miami
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and the Camp David retreat were not sufficient
for Nixon. He bought houses on Key Biscayne _ the complex that came
to be known as the Florida White House _ and at San Clemente, the
fourteen-room house and estate in California styled the Western
White House. Nixon himself purchased the properties, with a massive
financial assist from Bebe Rebozo and aerosol tycoon Robert
Abplanalp. The government, however, was to spend more than ten
million dollars _ more than forty-four million dollars at today's
values _ to install special features not only at Nixon's
out-of-town homes but also at houses he frequented, like
Abplanalp's in the Bahamas. ...
</P>
<P>
   Nixon had nine offices for his personal use: the Oval Office, a
hideaway in the Executive Office Building, a room in his private
quarters, two at Camp David, one at the Key Biscayne house, another
at Abplanalp's Caribbean home, and two at San Clemente. All
required sophisticated communications systems, installed at public
expense. A former Budget Bureau official would calculate that, by
four years into the presidency, Nixon's household expenses had
added up to a hundred million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon spent more than one in three nights away from the White
House in the first eighteen months of his term. While the days of
absence included foreign trips, there were also forty-two trips to
Camp David, fourteen to Key Biscayne, and nine to San Clemente. The
California stays tended to last two or three weeks. ...
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's assistant Alexander Butterfield was struck by the fact
that his boss ``had so much leisure time. There were many days with
no appointments at all. Every now and then he would work like a
Trojan. ... But generally he allowed plenty of time to sit and kick
things around. ... And every afternoon Nixon took a nap.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Early in his travels as president, Nixon was greeted in Brussels
by royal guards in operatically grand uniforms. In India he was
escorted by outriders in British Empire-vintage scarlet coats. One
of these trips reportedly inspired the outfitting of the White
House police in similarly outlandish uniforms. The new outfits,
high-necked white tunics with gold epaulets, first appeared on
public view a year after the inauguration. They were topped by tall
military caps with blue and gold visors, reportedly paid for by
Nixon himself.
</P>
<P>
   After early critics noted how plump the uniforms made their
wearers look, the policemen were ordered to diet. Then, following a
national chorus of ridicule, the regalia was withdrawn altogether.
The tunics were eventually sold off to high school bands in Iowa,
and the caps reappeared at an Alice Cooper rock concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``The President,'' H.R. Haldeman said by way of explaining the
uniforms, had ``wanted something more formal.'' Peter Flanigan,
Nixon's political adviser, thought the livery an attempt to emulate
the ``grandeur'' his boss admired in Charles de Gaulle. ... Defense
Secretary James Schlesinger, who agreed that Nixon tried to imitate
de Gaulle, suggested dryly in a 1997 interview that therein lay the
difference: Nixon was ``a shrewd, calculating figure, but no giant.
He would have liked to have been more giant than he was. He was not
an imposing figure like de Gaulle.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   The official roster of Britain's nobility, Burke's Peerage,
pronounced Nixon one of thirteen U.S. presidents able to claim
royal ancestry. The grocer's son from Whittier was supposedly a
direct descendant of King Edward III (d. 1377) and thus distantly
related to Queen Elizabeth II and Sir Winston Churchill. While
thousands of people can claim similar bloodlines, one should
perhaps not assume this was totally irrelevant to Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often felt that inwardly the president secretly wanted to be
considered an English lord,'' said his close associate Herb Klein,
``someone who, like Jack Kennedy, would be praised for upgrading
the social dignity of the White House. ... he longed for this elite
social distinction.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon himself denied such notions. ``The Imperial President,''
he wrote, was a straw man created by defensive congressmen and by
disillusioned liberals. ...'' One such critic was future Speaker
Tip O'Neill. ``After he became President,'' O'Neill recalled,
``Nixon seemed to change. He no longer played cards with our group,
and I doubt he played with anybody. Unlike Truman, Kennedy and
Johnson, Nixon didn't pal around much with his old friends ... he
became aloof and imperial.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some Republican stalwarts had similar thoughts. ``I could
not detect a touch of humility in his demeanor or in his facial
expression,'' Federal Reserve chairman Arthur Burns said of the
inauguration. ``That troubled me very much. That, combined with his
attitude when he took me through the White House and talked about
its splendor.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   He behaved ``like Napoleon,'' said the San Diego entrepreneur
Arnholt Smith, who had known Nixon since childhood. ``I mean, he
was very imperious, gave you a feeling you were almost traveling
with God.'' Former Republican Party chairman Len Hall thought Nixon
became ``regal, kinglike. ... He loved power, power to sit in that
Oval Office and just issue orders. ...''

THE ARROGANCE OF POWER: THE SECRET WORLD OF RICHARD NIXON 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;    (ATTENTION EDITORS: ``The Arrogance of Power: The Secret World
of Richard Nixon,'' written by former BBC journalist Anthony
Summers with Robbyn Swan, is an exhaustive investigation of the
life and career of the 37th president of the United States. In
researching the book, Summers conducted more than a thousand
inteviews and drew on hundreds of thousands of documents. The New
York Times Syndicate is pleased to offer three 1,000-word excerpts
from the biography. NIXON-BIOGRAPHY-EXCERPT1 examines Nixon's
alleged abuse of his wife, Pat. NIXON-BIOGRAPHY-EXCERPT2 deals with
how Nixon's obsession with the office and trappings of the
presidency led him to behave ``like Napoleon,'' as one longtime
associate recalled. NIXON-BIOGRAPHY-EXCERPT3 recounts Nixon's use
of the prescription drug Dilantin and personal behavior so erratic
that it worried those in charge of national security.)

 &HT;    By ANTHONY SUMMERS with ROBBYN SWAN 
 &HT;    (North American rights only) 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Anthony Summers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Mr. Summers describes how, in 1968, the founder of the Dreyfus
Fund gave Richard Nixon a large quantity of the prescription drug
Dilantin, which Nixon began taking without a doctor's supervision.
In 1974, as his presidency deteriorated, Mr. Summers recounts how
Nixon's aides and advisers took steps to ensure that an
increasingly erratic president didn't compromise national
security.)
</P>
<P>
   It became clear during research for this book (that) Nixon
consumed large quantities of one particular drug over a long
period, apparently without a prescription or proper medical
supervision. The drug was Dilantin, the brand name of an
anti-epileptic medication known to pharmacologists as Phenytoin,
and the circumstances in which Nixon came to start taking it were
alarmingly casual. He heard about the drug, probably soon after
being elected president, while dining at Key Biscayne with Bebe
Rebozo and the millionaire founder of the Dreyfus Fund, Jack
Dreyfus, Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfus, who had contributed to the Nixon campaigns in both 1960
and 1968, had no medical qualifications. Having credited Dilantin
with relieving him of chronic depression almost overnight, he had
become the leading advocate of it as a panacea for all manner of
ailments. ...
</P>
<P>
   At their 1968 meeting in Key Biscayne, as Dreyfus told the
author, ``Nixon said, 'Why don't you give me some Dilantin?' So I
thought, 'What the heck, he's (going to be) president of the United
States. I can't get in trouble. ...' So I went out to the car and
got a bottle of a thousand and gave it to him. A few days later he
called me and said, 'Is it all right if I take two a day?' I said,
'Yes, I think so.' Later on when I went to see him at the White
House, he asked me if he could have some more. I gave him another
large bottle ....''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what Nixon wanted the Dilantin for, Dreyfus was vague.
Nixon, he said, had ``a lot of things ... worries.'' At one point,
when Dreyfus suggested that the president should perhaps get the
medication from a doctor, Nixon had said, 'To heck with the
doctor.''' ... The ``Physicians' Desk Reference,'' used by doctors
nationwide, lists numerous known adverse reactions to Dilantin.
They include ``slurred speech, decreased coordination, and mental
confusion, dizziness, insomnia, transient nervousness ...'' Dr.
Lawrence McDonald, a Washington physician consulted by the author,
was alarmed at the notion of anyone's _ especially a person in a
position of high responsibility _ using Dilantin in uncontrolled
doses or combined with other medications or alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``If such a user of the drug were the president of the United
States,'' Dr. McDonald said, ``I would be very nervous. Mental
confusion is not something you want in a leader. Dilantin certainly
could impair someone of that caliber from making correct and timely
and appropriate judgments. It's a potential time bomb, waiting to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon did use alcohol and did use sleeping pills. His longtime
speechwriter Ray Price recalled how even a single drink could make
him appear drunk ``if he had a sleeping pill.'' As if the drinking,
the sleeping pills, and the Dilantin were not troubling enough,
Rabbi Baruch Korff _ a Nixon apologist late in the presidency _
said he learned that ``at times he resorted to amphetamines.''
Amphetamines, of course, are stimulants, the opposite of the
relaxing medications mentioned by other associates. ...
</P>
<P>
   The uncertain days of August 1974 sparked unprecedented
precautions, the logical outcome of months of anxiety about the
president's mental stability. ... A group of legislators, headed by
Jacob Javits, the Republican senator from New York, even consulted
the director of the National Institute of Mental Health, Dr.
Bertram Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had breakfast with a half dozen senators,'' Brown recalled.
``It was to talk about these issues, whether he would lose his
cool. ... Whether he was going crazy, becoming psychotic, whether
he would start a war.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   The secretary of defense, James Schlesinger ... was already
alert to such fears. His attention had been drawn to the
president's state of mind by a phone call a few months earlier from
Joseph Laitin, the public affairs spokesman of the Office of
Management and Budget, based in the Executive Office Building, just
across from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the author Laitin vividly recalled the
encounter with Nixon in the spring of 1974 that prompted him to
phone Schlesinger. ``I was on my way over to the West Wing of the
White House to see Treasury Secretary George Shultz,'' Laitin said.
``I'd reached the basement, near the Situation Room. And just as I
was about to ascend the stairway, a guy came running down the
stairs two steps at a time. He had a frantic look on his face,
wildeyed, like a madman. And he bowled me over, so I kind of lost
my balance. And before I could pick myself up, six athletic-looking
young men leapt over me, pursuing him. I suddenly realized that
they were Secret Service agents, that I'd been knocked over by the
president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Laitin was so shocked at Nixon's appearance that he postponed
the meeting with Shultz and returned to his office. ``I sat there
stunned,'' he said, ``and I thought, you know, 'That madman I have
just seen has his finger on the red button.' I had a number for
Schlesinger, a phone that only he would answer. I called him, and I
asked him if the president could order the use of atomic weapons
without going through the secretary of defense. I said, 'If I were
in your position, I would want to know who the nearest combat-ready
troops were who would respond to the president's wishes to surround
the White House. I would want to know what the next nearest
combat-ready division was, which would not only be able to overcome
them but also respond only to the chain of command. That's what I
have to say.' Then there was just a click at the other end, as the
secretary of defense hung up.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Given his own access to the president, Schlesinger also had the
benefit of his own observations. He was also aware of concern that
the White House might attempt to use the military to prevent the
president from being forced from office. ... In late July, he asked
for a meeting with the chairman of the joint Chiefs, Air Force
General George Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him,'' the former secretary recalled in an interview
with the author, ``that every order that would come from the White
House had to come to me directly, immediately upon receipt. ... The
message had to be gotten through that there were not to be any
extraordinary measures taken. The message did get through.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   A former army operations intelligence specialist, Barry Toll,
told a Senate committee in closed session: ``The last week or so of
the Nixon administration we received a top secret 'eyes only,'
limited distribution order effectively instructing us not to obey
the president _ on anything, not just nuclear, until further
notice. ... It was signed, at the Joint Chiefs' insistence, as I
understood it, by not one but two cabinet officers. The names I
recall as having signed were Secretary Schlesinger and Secretary
Kissinger.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The end of the Nixon presidency was an extraordinary episode
in American history,'' former Secretary Schlesinger said in 2000.
``I am proud of my role in protecting the integrity of the chain of
command. You could say it was synonymous with protecting the
Constitution.''

occasion, which included slamming a wrestler named Rhino into a
table, Van Dam wore the Arena Football jersey of his late friend,
Bobby Duncum Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Just a couple of months prior to the March show, Van Dam was in
Allentown, Pa., signing autographs at a memorial show for another
late wrestling buddy, Gary Albright. Van Dam has lost three close
friends in the wrestling business, Louis ``Spicolli'' Mucciolo Jr.
two years ago and Albright and Duncum since January. Albright, at
36, was the oldest. Duncum was 34 and Mucciolo, 27. ``With Louie, I
hadn't been there before,'' Van Dam said. ``The more it happens,
the less shocked I am.'' (Maher, Austin American-Statesman) WITH

<P>
   Neil LaBute's ``Nurse Betty'' might have been a little more
engaging had it been made, say, 10 years ago. As it stands, the
film feels all too familiar, its story and subplots having been
done (and quite a bit better, I might add) by movies like ``The
Truman Show'' and ``Pulp Fiction.'' Certainly there are some
pleasant enough diversions here, but the movie's violent action and
fantastical themes never gel in a satisfying way, particularly
coming from the director who gave us such tart pleasures as ``In
the Company of Men'' and ``Your Friends &AMP; Neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nurse Betty'' marks the first time LaBute has directed a
screenplay he didn't write. It also takes the misanthropic
filmmaker away from the claustrophobic character studies that he
has done so well and into a more conventional and larger-scaled
story. Clearly this is a transitional film, and, given the movie's
fitful pace, it's equally clear that LaBute is still feeling his
way around the nuances of more complicated moviemaking.
</P>
<P>
   The Betty of the movie's title is Betty Sizemore, a coffee shop
waitress played by Renee Zellweger with all the scrunchy-faced,
sweet vulnerability she can muster. Betty's life in Fair Oaks,
Kan., is pretty pathetic. Her husband, Del (frequent LaBute
collaborator Aaron Eckhart), is a dumb lout who's two-timing her
with a co-worker at his used-car dealership. On her birthday, he
doesn't give her a present, makes her cook dinner and clean the
dishes, and even eats the cupcake Betty's waitress friends gave
her.
</P>
<P>
   The one pleasure Betty has in life is her soap opera, ``A Reason
to Love.'' Betty's reason to watch: actor George McCord's (Greg
Kinnear, smarmy again) portrayal of Dr. David Ravell, a handsome
doctor who seems to embody everything Betty unconsciously longs for
in her life.
</P>
<P>
   Through a grisly turn in her life, Betty, the naive girl from
Kansas (LaBute has her wearing a gingham dress at one point, just
in case you're not clued in to the ``Oz'' connection) gets to meet
her Prince Charming. The only problem is that Betty believes that
Dr. David and his ``Reason to Love'' world actually exist. This
comes as news to McCord, who initially thinks that Betty is just a
wildly determined Method actress looking to win a part on his soap.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two hit men, Charlie (Morgan Freeman) and Wesley
(Chris Rock) pursue Betty to California, determined to find the
Buick and the valuable stash of drugs hidden in its trunk. Along
the way, Charlie (Freeman) becomes a bit of an obsessive himself,
fixating on Betty as if she were the woman of his dreams instead of
his latest (and last, he's retiring) target for murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nurse Betty'' is at its best when Betty, in her dementia,
collides with the ``Reason to Love'' world. But even here, the
situations seem a bit passe, the screenplay's observations about
fame and obsession having been done with more meaning and insight
in other films. LaBute's conviction that the human soul is
essentially a vacant place remains intact, but the means of
depicting life's emptiness has escaped him here.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman delivers his most interesting performance in years, but
again the screenplay (written by short story writer John C.
Richards and James Flamberg) proves wanting. The profane dialogue
between Charlie and his protege, Wesley, is typically inane and
manages to accomplish the impossible _ it neuters Chris Rock's
tremendous comic appeal. It's ``Pulp Fiction's'' hit men six years
_ and countless imitations _ down the road. Enough. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
The film: ``Nurse Betty'' (R; strong violence, pervasive language
and a scene of sexuality). &QL; 
The stars: Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, Chris Rock, Greg
Kinnear. &QL; 
Behind the scenes: Directed by Neil LaBute. Screenplay by John C.
Richards and James Flamberg. Released by USA Films. &QL; 
Running time: One hour, 52 minutes. &QL;

NATURAL BORN THRILLER
</HEADLINE>
  Artistic director dares to deal with controversial subject on the
stage 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
 
 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's with all the talking? wonders Wayne Hudson. If two people
are pointing guns at each other in one of those cinematic
stand-offs, why doesn't somebody just start shooting?
</P>
<P>
   Wayne knows a little bit about these situations. Not only has he
killed a bunch of people, but he's seen too many movies in the
``Pulp Fiction'' and ``Desperado'' genre. Just to make things
interesting, he has also kidnapped _ at gunpoint _ Bruce Delmetri,
the Tarantino-esque maker of bang bang splatter pictures on the
very night Bruce has won an Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to ``Popcorn'' a kind of Natural Born Morality Play that
has playwright Ben Elton taking the ``Scream'' treatment to the
serial killer genre. Hudson is dangerous not simply because he's
holding the weapon, but because he knows how the game is played,
and he blames Delmetri for making him the way he is.
</P>
<P>
   A best-selling novel before it became a critical favorite on the
London stage, ``Popcorn'' has had only one non-professional
production in the United States before artistic director Jeremiah
Morris secured the rights for the El Portal Center for the Arts in
North Hollywood. The production, which opens tonight may insure
that the theater's inaugural season ends in a blaze of gunfire and
four letter words, the likes of which El Portal audiences may not
be expecting.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes, says Morris, the El Portal's artistic director and
the director of ``Popcorn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of people thought I was crazy (for staging it),''
admits Morris, who fell in love with the play after stumbling into
the London production a few years ago. ``The language is rough at
times and there's violence in it. But it's a very funny black
comedy and it's about responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This one is just going to rock the rafters,'' says Maxwell
Caulfield, who plays the kidnapped director Bruce Delmetri. ``It's
very courageous of Jeremiah to mount this piece at his theater
because we're doing it literally in Hollywood's back yard. I'm
expecting to hear a few seat backs slapping (from people leaving
the theater), but if the audience can handle the dialogue for the
first two minutes, hopefully we've got 'em for the rest of the
night.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who haven't been paying attention to the rantings of
Democratic vice presidential hopeful Joseph Lieberman the past few
years, ``Popcorn'' is a kind of answer to the glorification of
celebrity serial killers and all those charges of reckless and
over-violent content on TV in videogames or at a multiplex near
you.
</P>
<P>
   We've heard the ``responsible art'' debate throughout the 1990s,
with ``The Silence of the Lambs,'' ``Natural Born Killers'' and
even in connection with the recently opened Jennifer Lopez hit
``The Cell.'' It's a question that won't seem to die no matter how
many bullets you pump into it, how many slashes it absorbs or how
many times you set it on fire. Are the Oliver Stones, Quentin
Tarantinos and Tarsems (director of ``The Cell'') of the world in
some way culpable when a kid takes an uzi to school? Whose fault is
Columbine? Do we have to watch? Can we tear ourselves away?
</P>
<P>
   Caulfield and David Faustino, who play ``Popcorn's'' two
adversaries, have examined questions. Faustino, a Burbank native,
grew up in a household where crude language and nudity on
television were considered taboo, but the depiction of violence was
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   He then went on to play the perpetually horny Bud Bundy for 11
years on Fox's ``Married ... with Children,'' a program that drew
more than its share of criticism for raunch. Ironically, it was the
initial controversy and threat of advertisers to pull their ads,
that helped the TV program take off. Told they shouldn't watch,
audiences couldn't turn away.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were offended about it because we dissed each other
back and forth and there was some sexual innuendo,'' says Faustino,
playing against type as ``Popcorn's'' serial killer Wayne Hudson.
``Our whole thing was like, 'You know, if you don't like it just
turn the channel. You don't have to watch it.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really started thinking about it until the Columbine
situation. Then I started thinking, 'Wow, could it really affect
people that greatly and are we responsible?' 'Popcorn's' coming at
a perfect time because everybody is starting to ask the question
and it's really an interesting question.''
</P>
<P>
   Caulfield, a British actor who has appeared in more than a few
low budget shoot-'em-ups, says that he raised an eyebrow when the
Motion Picture Academy bestowed its 1991 Best Picture Oscar on
``The Silence of the Lambs'' _ a movie Bruce Delmetri probably
would have considered tame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought ('Silence') was a hugely entertaining movie, but I
didn't feel that a play celebrating a super-villain, this Hannibal
Lecter character, should play and resonate around the world. I
frankly didn't see the value of it,'' says Caulfield. ``Now I know
that runs counter to the character I'm playing (in 'Popcorn'), but
one of the reasons I was drawn to the play is the subject matter.''
</P>
<P>
   And even though he isn't necessarily a fan of Delmetri-esque
flicks, Caulfield acknowledges that the play's argument over
responsibility is by no means a black and white discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruce is a complex contradictory character who refuses to have
the blame shifted on to him,'' Caulfield says.
</P>
<P>
   Elton's work isn't widely known across the Atlantic. The
41-year-old playwright/stand-up comedian co-wrote the successful
BBC sitcom ``The Young Ones,'' and later wrote the ``Blackadder''
series with his partner, Richard Curtis. ``Popcorn,'' Elton's
fourth novel, was a best-seller and was nominated as Book of the
Year by the Booksellers Association.
</P>
<P>
   The play, written to address the fervor over celebrity serial
killers in Oliver Stone's ``Natural Born Killers,'' won the
Laurence Olivier Award for best comedy. Its film rights are
currently in the hands of director Joel Schumacher.
</P>
<P>
   El Portal administrators say they hope to being Elton to NoHo
for ``Popcorn's'' premiere, but to do that, they'll have to pry him
away from Andrew Lloyd Webber with whom Elton is collaborating on
the new soccer-themed musical, ``The Beautiful Game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our appreciation for the piece grows every day,'' says
Caulfield. ``It's one of these plays where as people are laughing,
you ram the truth down their throats.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Parents teaching their children how to use the Internet safely
now may call upon a growing group of spunky cartoon characters
armed with advice.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Duck slays computer viruses with a pea shooter. The Three
CyberPigs uncover racism on the Web. And the Idea Seekers gang,
which includes a superhero who fights the ``Darkness of Dumbness,''
urges children not to respond to ``strange, mean or upsetting''
e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites run by law enforcement agencies and children's
organizations have offered tips to parents on shielding their
children from Internet harm. But until recently, few sites spoke
directly to children about Internet dangers. And those that did
were normally flat _ minimal color, movement and opportunity to
interact.
</P>
<P>
   That's changing. This year, with an estimated 25 million
children online in the United States, site developers are melding
rainbow vibrance with sound and motion to foster safe and
responsible Internet use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick is to deliver the content in a very engaging way,''
said Lane Beauchamp, a development director for Circle 1 Network,
which produces Web sites for children. ``White text on a black
background, or vice versa, is not terribly engaging to
8-year-olds.''
</P>
<P>
   Beauchamp called Internet safety games ``the Mary Poppins
approach _ a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Web sites are reflecting that method with free games
aimed at pre-teens. In April, the Canadian Media Awareness Network
(www.media-awareness.ca) released ``Cybersense and Nonsense,'' in
which children help three skateboarding pigs learn that not all
wolves blow houses down. In June, Circle 1's KidsCom Web site
(www.kidscom.com) charged up its Internet safety word puzzles with
cartoon characters that swirl around the mouse-controlled arrow
pointer.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Disney Online established ``Surf Swell Island''
(www.surfswellisland.com), where children guide Disney characters
through spooky Internet scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been devoted to Internet safety,'' said Carol
Rozio, Disney Online spokeswoman. ``We just think (children) should
be armed with these tools.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Surf Swell Island includes links to Disney's vacation
packages and merchandise _ links that Rozio said appear for
consistency on all Disney Online pages _ Rozio said Disney makes no
money from the Internet safety site. It does not, she noted,
include advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, children will be able to choose among even more games.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, the Cybercitizen Partnership, a project
of the U.S. Department of Justice and the Information Technology
Association of America Foundation, plans to launch a site with
safety games. The Boys &AMP; Girls Clubs of America has enlisted the
National Center for Missing &AMP; Exploited Children to develop an
Internet safety curriculum with games to be available to members by
early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope it will have a different effect than sitting them down
with a bunch of rules in front of them,'' said Tina Schwartz, a
national center spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Playing an Internet safety game feels like any other computer
game for children. Happy music accompanies cute animation that
glides across the screen. In the Disney site's ``No Privacy Beach''
game for example, children save Minnie from peeping Toms, who find
out her vacation destination on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As Minnie lounges in a chair, children use the computer mouse to
click on the creeps that sneak peaks. With every few successful
clicks, messages pop up, like ``Never, ever give out your
password.''
</P>
<P>
   The games quiz children about Internet safety in some way. At
the end of ``No Privacy Beach,'' Minnie asks the children to
respond to true-or-false statements, including, ``It is bad to tell
your password to your online pals'' and ``It is OK to tell someone
in a chat room your name and address as long as the person is a
grown-up.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Instructional games are the way to go, said Jane Tallim,
Internet and media education specialist for the Media Advocacy
Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think kids enjoy games because of the same interactivity
that makes the Internet so appealing to them,'' she said. ``Putting
(safety tips) in a game form can make some of the more serious
issues not as threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   Parry Aftab, executive director of the child advocacy
organization Cyberangels, said the biggest Internet hazard for
children isn't pornography.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to see porn. They're going to see really crummy
stuff. They're going to see sites that say the Holocaust never
happened, hate sites, not scholarly ones,'' she said. ``If parents
understand that the Internet is not (like) the television but
(like) the telephone, they'll see that the greatest danger is
meeting strangers.''
</P>
<P>
   In a report this year, the National Center for Missing &AMP;
Exploited Children noted 785 sex crime cases during 1999 in which a
child or adult went to see someone they had met over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Aftab said children willingly meet the strangers face-to-face
because they don't know any better. She said children need to grasp
the safety rules of the Internet, just like they should know to
look both ways before crossing the street.
</P>
<P>
   Internet safety games, along with parental guidance, can teach
children the basics: don't give personal information; don't open
e-mail files you weren't expecting; don't arrange to meet with
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't yet found a kid killed online,'' said Aftab, author
of ``The Parent's Guide to Protecting Your Children in
Cyberspace.'' ``The kids are still safe when they're on the other
side of the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet safety experts say parents shouldn't rely on computer
programs that filter undesirable content such as profane language
and nudity from appearing on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, 61 percent of the 30,000 children who took part in
a survey conducted by children's publishing giant Scholastic Inc.
said that parents and teachers should be able to block their access
to certain Web sites. Not surprisingly, 88 percent of the 1,200
parents who participated and 94 percent of the 3,200 teachers
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   But Tallim said that keeping explicit content from children
can't protect them from predators in Internet chat rooms or help
them pinpoint shady commercial Web sites. The best way to help
children navigate the Internet safely, she said, is to give them
the critical knowledge necessary to distinguish truth from lies on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to the Internet, the kids are ahead of the
adults as far as exploration,'' she said. ``The important point is,
they might be ahead in their activity, but they are not that far
ahead in terms of life understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Aftab said the games emerging now can help parents who are
squeamish about talking to their children about tough issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these games, kids don't know they're learning,'' she
said. ``They think they're playing.''

rainbow vibrance with sound and motion to foster safe and
responsible Internet use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick is to deliver the content in a very engaging way,''
said Lane Beauchamp, a development director for Circle 1 Network,
which produces Web sites for children. ``White text on a black
background, or vice versa, is not terribly engaging to
8-year-olds.''
</P>
<P>
   Beauchamp called Internet safety games ``the Mary Poppins
approach _ a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Web sites are reflecting that method with free games
aimed at pre-teens. In April, the Canadian Media Awareness Network
(www.media-awareness.ca) released ``Cybersense and Nonsense,'' in
which children help three skateboarding pigs learn that not all
wolves blow houses down. In June, Circle 1's KidsCom Web site
(www.kidscom.com) charged up its Internet safety word puzzles with
cartoon characters that swirl around the mouse-controlled arrow
pointer.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Disney Online established ``Surf Swell Island''
(www.surfswellisland.com), where children guide Disney characters
through spooky Internet scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been devoted to Internet safety,'' said Carol
Rozio, Disney Online spokeswoman. ``We just think (children) should
be armed with these tools.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Surf Swell Island includes links to Disney's vacation
packages and merchandise _ links that Rozio said appear for
consistency on all Disney Online pages _ Rozio said Disney makes no
money from the Internet safety site. It does not, she noted,
include advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, children will be able to choose among even more games.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, the Cybercitizen Partnership, a project
of the U.S. Department of Justice and the Information Technology
Association of America Foundation, plans to launch a site with
safety games. The Boys &AMP; Girls Clubs of America has enlisted the
National Center for Missing &AMP; Exploited Children to develop an
Internet safety curriculum with games to be available to members by
early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope it will have a different effect than sitting them down
with a bunch of rules in front of them,'' said Tina Schwartz, a
national center spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Playing an Internet safety game feels like any other computer
game for children. Happy music accompanies cute animation that
glides across the screen. In the Disney site's ``No Privacy Beach''
game for example, children save Minnie from peeping Toms, who find
out her vacation destination on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As Minnie lounges in a chair, children use the computer mouse to
click on the creeps that sneak peaks. With every few successful
clicks, messages pop up, like ``Never, ever give out your
password.''
</P>
<P>
   The games quiz children about Internet safety in some way. At
the end of ``No Privacy Beach,'' Minnie asks the children to
respond to true-or-false statements, including, ``It is bad to tell
your password to your online pals'' and ``It is OK to tell someone
in a chat room your name and address as long as the person is a
grown-up.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Instructional games are the way to go, said Jane Tallim,
Internet and media education specialist for the Media Advocacy
Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think kids enjoy games because of the same interactivity
that makes the Internet so appealing to them,'' she said. ``Putting
(safety tips) in a game form can make some of the more serious
issues not as threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   Parry Aftab, executive director of the child advocacy
organization Cyberangels, said the biggest Internet hazard for
children isn't pornography.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to see porn. They're going to see really crummy
stuff. They're going to see sites that say the Holocaust never
happened, hate sites, not scholarly ones,'' she said. ``If parents
understand that the Internet is not (like) the television but
(like) the telephone, they'll see that the greatest danger is
meeting strangers.''
</P>
<P>
   In a report this year, the National Center for Missing &AMP;
Exploited Children noted 785 sex crime cases during 1999 in which a
child or adult went to see someone they had met over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Aftab said children willingly meet the strangers face-to-face
because they don't know any better. She said children need to grasp
the safety rules of the Internet, just like they should know to
look both ways before crossing the street.
</P>
<P>
   Internet safety games, along with parental guidance, can teach
children the basics: don't give personal information; don't open
e-mail files you weren't expecting; don't arrange to meet with
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't yet found a kid killed online,'' said Aftab, author
of ``The Parent's Guide to Protecting Your Children in
Cyberspace.'' ``The kids are still safe when they're on the other
side of the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet safety experts say parents shouldn't rely on computer
programs that filter undesirable content such as profane language
and nudity from appearing on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, 61 percent of the 30,000 children who took part in
a survey conducted by children's publishing giant Scholastic Inc.
said that parents and teachers should be able to block their access
to certain Web sites. Not surprisingly, 88 percent of the 1,200
parents who participated and 94 percent of the 3,200 teachers
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   But Tallim said that keeping explicit content from children
can't protect them from predators in Internet chat rooms or help
them pinpoint shady commercial Web sites. The best way to help
children navigate the Internet safely, she said, is to give them
the critical knowledge necessary to distinguish truth from lies on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to the Internet, the kids are ahead of the
adults as far as exploration,'' she said. ``The important point is,
they might be ahead in their activity, but they are not that far
ahead in terms of life understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Aftab said the games emerging now can help parents who are
squeamish about talking to their children about tough issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these games, kids don't know they're learning,'' she
said. ``They think they're playing.''

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Call it the ``no show'' factor.
</P>
<P>
   That's the term workplace analyst Nancy Kaylor uses to explain a
growing concern that an increased percentage of employees are not
only playing hooky, they're feeling entitled to the time off.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at CCH, a consultancy that tracks human resource
issues, call the trend part of an ``entitlement mentality'' or
backlash triggered by the downsizings, mergers, and reorganizations
that left millions of workers unemployed and shell shocked in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that people called in sick because they were
sick,'' noted Kaylor, a member of the CCH staff. ``Now, because
they are frazzled or stressed and, in some cases, working longer
hours, people are calling in sick when they aren't sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the unexpected 8 a.m. calls that come into the
bosses' desk on Friday and are usually attributed to the sniffling
that actually started at 3 p.m. Thursday. We refer to it as an
entitlement mentality because people now feel, `I deserve it. You
owe me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After surveying 350 human resource executives from mid-sized and
large companies in the United States, CCH found while absenteeism
has declined seven percent since 1995, the percentage of
unscheduled absences due to stress and the entitlement mentality
has soared, rising to 19 percent from six percent five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The cost to large companies? About $3.14 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, family issues and personal illnesses are still the
two leading reasons for unexpected or unscheduled absences, each
accounting for 21 percent of all such absences, CCH reports.
</P>
<P>
   Still, says Kaylor, the jump in stress-related absenteeism bears
watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this very, very tight labor market, it falls to fewer
workers in a lot of cases to get the job done,'' she said. ``At a
certain point, having given 120 percent over days, weeks, or even
months, people begin to feel that they now deserve a break, but
they don't want to take a vacation day.''
</P>
<P>
   When CCH researchers looked at the numbers, they found
university, government, and health care workers are more likely to
take time off than any other sector. Indeed, the rate of
absenteeism among university employees increased 17 percent between
1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The health care industry, which experienced a 12 percent
increase during the same period, now has the highest number of
absences among all industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies are finding ways to ease high stress levels and
unscheduled days off.
</P>
<P>
   When First Union Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., found that some of
its 80,000 employees were routinely taking time off while others,
also hard workers, never called in sick, it instituted a PTO, or
paid time off policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We moved from traditional sick pay and vacation day policy to
paid time off for several reasons,'' said Angela Mull, assistance
vice president of human resources. ``The biggest one was that a lot
of people felt they were entitled to sick days. We noticed that
certain employees would sit at the office and pick up the slack all
the time. They rarely or never used their sick days.''
</P>
<P>
   The company responded by putting all paid sick and vacation days
into a bank. ``If you don't get sick, you get six additional
vacation days. . . Now, all of a sudden we don't have as many sick
people anymore. Instead of unscheduled absences, we require that
workers call in advance and schedule the day off. People don't have
to steal a day off anymore. They are entitled to them.''
</P>
<P>
   First Union also offers 10 paid days per year for people who
need time for family matters to take that time without dipping into
their paid time off. The company calls this benefit family care
time.
</P>
<P>
   Noted Kaylor, ``Paid leave banks are good for the worker and the
boss. There is no longer a situation where an employee is calling
in at the last minute. It's the last-minute no show that throws a
wrench into things for the employer and for co-workers.''

&HT;     HONDA PLANS NEW FEATURES TO BOOST ACCORD SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Freshened styling,'' a longer list of standard features and
enhanced safety are among the changes for the 2001 Honda Accord
sedan and coupe, Honda says.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are designed to further broaden the appeal of the
second-best-selling car in America and perhaps help Honda regain
the lead in the all-important midsize sedan market.
</P>
<P>
   As for safety, the 2001 Accord includes dual-threshold front air
bags that monitor seatbelt use and crash severity, and then adjust
air-bag deployment accordingly. In addition, side air bags are
standard on all V-6 and four-cylinder EX models. For DX and LX
models, the side air bags will be optional.
</P>
<P>
   This advanced system prevents the passenger side air bag from
deploying if a child or small adult is leaning into the path of the
air bag.
</P>
<P>
   Styling has been refreshed, with more sharply chiseled front
fascia and hood on the sedans, along with new taillights and
revised rear deck lid.
</P>
<P>
   The ``sporting character'' of the Accord coupe is enhanced by
more aggressive front and rear bumpers, a body-color grille and new
alloy wheel designs, Honda says.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 engineering refinements are designed to reduce road
and wind noise for a more comfortable driving experience.
</P>
<P>
   New features for 2001 include body-color side moldings and
illuminated power window switches on all Accord models except the
DX sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Standard on all EX models will be floormats and an AM/FM stereo
with in-dash six-disc CD player.
</P>
<P>
   All V-6 powered Accords will get Honda's traction-control system
as standard equipment.
</P>

   PROTECT THOSE CLASSIC CARS
</P>
<P>
   For those of you with classic cars or other vehicles that are
stored most of the time, and which need long-term protection from
the elements even while inside your garage, PDK Automotive of
Indiana now offers the CarCapsule, a patented system to seal the
vehicle inside a plastic ``bubble.''
</P>
<P>
   The clear vinyl bubble keeps dust, dirt and insects away from
the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-volt high-pressure fan, with a five-year rating, provides
continuous airflow inside the bubble to keep the vehicle dry. The
air changes inside the bubble three or four times every hour to
keep moisture from condensing on the vehicle's exposed surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Cost of operation of the fan is less than $1.50 a month, the
company says.
</P>
<P>
   You drive the vehicle onto the laminated fabric base mat, put
the cover over the vehicle, zip it closed, and then turn on the
fan.
</P>
<P>
   The vinyl covering is 8mm double-sewn polyvinyl-chloride, the
zipper is all nylon so it won't scratch, and the base is impervious
to gasoline and oil drippings.
</P>
<P>
   Suggested retail prices range from $229 to $449, depending on
size; you can cover everything from a motorcycle to a truck. For
information, call 800-735-2822 or visit the company's Web site at
www.carcapsule.com.

<P>
   ``Only Americans would think of pouring acid on the stomach
first thing in the morning,'' Marlene Dietrich reportedly said
about the national fondness for orange juice, and who knows what
wonders the work force could produce were it to abandon juice for
espresso.
</P>
<P>
   The magical properties of this beverage were first revealed to
me by my landlady in Florence, a feisty, maniacally energetic
grandmother. Fifty weeks out of the year, she and her husband
provided room and board for as many as four foreigners studying
Italian at a school in the city center. While signore had a few
responsibilities _ fetching fresh rolls every morning for
breakfast, helping load the dishwasher, and operating the cunning
cheese grater with a proprietary flourish at dinner _ signora was
the motor that drove the household, and we all knew it. A dynamo in
an apron and bravely dyed hair, she was constantly in motion,
cooking, washing up, laundering, and, at the end of the day,
ironing in the kitchen while the Italian version of ``People's
Court'' played on the TV.
</P>
<P>
   Signore spoke at a normal conversational speed and was thus
incomprehensible to me and the other students. But signora was
always careful to enunciate clearly for the foreign contingent, to
compliment us extravagantly on our vocabulary and accents (``Why,
you could be Italian!''), to exclaim over the accomplishments of
our families (``Ma pensa,'' she would breathe in admiration, ``Just
think''), and to pass politely over our mistakes (as when Ana from
Slovenia attempted to convey with the phrase ``Sendo il
telegrammo'' that she had sent a telegram home). She took us into
her confidence too, sharing her ferocious political opinions,
culinary preferences, and tales of shiftless relations.
</P>
<P>
   Signora and signore always rose before dawn, to get breakfast
ready for the students, so it was not until the day that I left
Florence, on an early train, that I had a glimpse of their private
morning routine. Wearing a stylish dressing gown, her hair in
curlers, signora was sipping an espresso from a demitasse cup, and
graciously offered me my own.
</P>
<P>
   That morning I was too distracted by the prospect of my journey
to accept, but years later I learned that this canny soul who knew
so much also knew the best way to begin the day. Nothing can
surpass the perfection of espresso first thing in the morning;
potent beyond its size, deliciously dark and licorice-y, it clears
the brain with an astonishing rapidity and then departs, leaving
only a pleasant afterglow. In both stovetop and pump-driven
espresso machines the water is forced through the finely ground
beans at high pressure, with the result that it acquires less
caffeine than drip or brewed coffee (100 milligrams per 2 ounces of
espresso as compared with 115 to 175 milligrams for a 7-ounce cup
of drip, and 80 to 135 milligrams for 7 ounces brewed). It thus is
less likely to upset the digestive system or cause insomnia, common
effects of the usual American coffee-making methods.
</P>
<P>
   One of espresso's many other virtues is how easy, quick, and
economical it is to prepare at home. The maker found in almost
every Italian household, including signora's, is the caffettiera, a
three-piece aluminum model that in the five-inch-high, three-cup
version (6 ounces of espresso) runs around $15. Even with
high-quality coffee closing in on $11 a pound, an espresso habit
won't break the budget, since you need only 2 tablespoons of ground
beans to make 6 ounces. Once you've filled the caffettiera with
water and coffee, and set it on a hot burner, it takes less than 3
minutes to bring the espresso spluttering into the top chamber of
the machine.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes that follow either use espresso as an ingredient or
pair harmoniously with it. And that brings us to the other, equally
enjoyable roles that espresso can play: a midmorning pick-me-up; a
delaying tactic after lunch, to postpone the return to work; with a
midafternoon sweet, to keep one going till supper; as the perfect
finish to a fine dinner . . . Ma pensa!
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
STOVETOP ESPRESSO &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Italians believe that you must grant the caffettiera a seasoning
period; with faithful daily use, the theory goes, it will produce
excellent espresso in a couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   French roast beans are the darkest and therefore the traditional
choice for espresso, although Italian roast and such types as
espresso blend also work well. If you don't have a good grinder at
home, ask the clerk at your local beanery to grind them
medium-fine; the result should be nearly a dust-like powder.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Water
</P>
<P>
   Finely ground French roast or other dark coffee
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the maximum amount of espresso the caffettiera will make,
fill the bottom half with cold water till just below the safety
valve mark. Set the perforated coffee basket in place and add 2
tablespoons of ground coffee for the 3-cup model, 4 for the 6-cup.
Tamp down the coffee lightly with the back of a spoon.
</P>
<P>
   Place the caffettiera on a hot burner. If you have an electric
stove, you can move the caffettiera around so that it's always
resting on a warm part of the burner. After about 2 1/2 minutes,
depending on the heat of your burner, the water will begin bubbling
as it is forced up through the ground coffee. As soon as all the
water has made it into the top chamber (you can check by carefully
tipping the pot forward; you'll be able to see the espresso in the
spout if it's done), remove the caffettiera from the heat; if you
leave it too long, the espresso will have a burned flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Any leftover espresso can be refrigerated and later reheated in
a microwave (forgive me, signora). Another use for cold espresso,
especially appealing in the summer, is to sweeten it and pour over
ice cream.
</P>

CHOCOLATE-PISTACHIO BISCOTTI &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Karen Witt, co-owner of Nashoba Brook Bakery in West Concord,
Mass., has created an extraordinary result with this recipe:
biscotti that are not dry, like the traditional twice-baked cookie,
but moist and cookie-like. The combination of the deep-brown
biscotti and pale-green pistachios appeals to the eye as well as
the palate. Witt calls for Valrhona cocoa powder, but other brands

<P>
   Viant Corp. stock fell by about 20 cents a share Tuesday in
perhaps one of the most deceptively negative bits of news floating
around the market all day.
</P>
<P>
   Losing a little pocket change per share mattered because the
Boston-based Internet consulting company had been hammered so
mercilessly Friday, when Viant announced it would fall well below
quarterly financial projections. That was on top of selling that
had gutted more than half the company's stock value the previous
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Many other companies working in similar corners of the Internet
took a hit with Viant on its news Friday. But most of them, like
Sapient Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., regained at least a chunk of
their lost ground Tuesday in seeming recognition of a hasty
overreaction last week. Not so for Viant stock.
</P>
<P>
   Internet consulting firms of this sort, often known as
``implementors'' because they help corporate clients build their
Internet operation, have been under pressure recently because of a
growing sense that the pace of their business growth is about to
slow.
</P>
<P>
   Established companies building out Internet sites are spending
more cautiously now and dot-com companies are under so much
stock-market pressure of their own that they must cut expenses
wherever possible, the argument goes. Consultants' bills are among
the expenses thrown overboard first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there does seem to be some indication many larger
companies that were in a race to become Web-ified have taken a step
back,'' said Marc Klee, comanager of the John Hancock Technology
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors disagree that any such slowdown is really taking
place and say that revenues among the Web consulting companies will
continue to impress for at least the balance of the year.
</P>

   ``In general, the Internet is going to show good to very good
results in the fourth quarter,'' said David Smith, a technology
analyst at Loomis Sayles &AMP; Co. in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But bits of evidence pile up. Another consulting company,
Xperior Inc. of Chicago, came out with bad forecasting news Tuesday
and lost more than 20 percent of its stock market value. Those
shares are down 42 percent since Xperior went public in December.
</P>
<P>
   The current stock market experience among Internet consultants
illustrates an important pattern that holds true across a much
broader span of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Those stocks, even most of the ones that have taken hits this
year, are still very expensive based on conventional standards.
People are willing to pay up for a group of companies that
specialize in something on the Web because revenues are growing
very fast, often 100 percent or more per year, and the firms have
some plausible explanation of how they are going to make money. In
short, they have a good story.
</P>
<P>
   But that involves more than a bit of the ``comp'' valuation
model used in real estate, in which a house is priced based on what
a comparable home in the same neighborhood sold for recently.
Announce a reason why any one company doesn't really belong in the
group _ slower sales growth, for example _ and it's a long fall
down.
</P>
<P>
   This is very bad news for the companies that miss early, because
Wall Street creates more stocks than any industry can really
support. Investment bankers will sell issues of anything popular
until people refuse to buy them any longer.
</P>
<P>
   Once a young Web company falls out of favor in comparison to its
industry competitors, bad things tend to happen and make it hard
for the stock to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Those weak shares make it harder to attract new employees or
retain those already on the job. It makes the process of raising
money needed to expand much more expensive. Customers begin to
gravitate toward the few companies perceived as leaders in their
field.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, talk about problems among the Internet consultants
gained profile last week when CS First Boston analyst Mark
Wolfenberger hammered away at Cambridge Technology Partners Inc.
and a few other stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But the cast-out phenomenon played out in Cambridge long ago.
Look it over and expect more of the same elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge Technology was once the leader of the pack among
consultants, back when client-server systems were the focus and the
Internet was barely in the picture.
</P>
<P>
   The company missed the turn to the Web and has been drained of
both capital and talent ever since. Cambridge stock is now down
about 86 percent from its peak, and employee turnover has been
clocked as high as 48 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaving between top-notch leaders and all the others in their
Internet field is likely to accelerate if the pace of customer
spending and stock market investing begins to slow.
</P>
<P>
   The question: Is that what we're seeing right now?
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts huge sums of money will find their way to the
Internet over time, but there could be fits and starts that dim
spending growth temporarily. That will ripple through practically
every segment of the Internet stock market.

   --Ouch! Shareholders of the Standish Small Cap Tax-Sensitive
Equity fund must still be hurting from last month's special
short-term capital gains distribution amounting to about 14.3
percent of the fund's assets. That's exactly the kind of event
tax-sensitive funds like this one managed by Boston's Standish Ayer
&AMP; Woods are designed to avoid. Chris Kelsch of Morningstar.com says
it's the biggest-ever for a tax-sensitive fund. He said the fund,
which was up more than 100 percent last year, had to sell assets to
match redemptions by many shareholders who cashed out to move with
manager Nicholas Battelle when he quit recently.
</P>
<P>
   --Back from the dead? Centennial Technologies Inc. of
Wilmington, Mass., the company former chief Emanuel Pinez rode
first to fame and finally to jail, has been soaring lately.
Centennial shares had been in the dumps ever since Pinez (now
serving five years in prison) and others were arrested in one of
the state's largest stock frauds. But they have been rejuvenated
ever since the company issued a very good quarterly report in
mid-July, soaring 140 percent to $19.75 as of Tuesday. Don't get
too excited about the comeback: Centennial's stock market value is
still just $63 million.

THE UN-SECRET SOCIETY: A TELLING STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's invasion of privacy time again. Comes now Peggy Salinger,
the only daughter of reclusive author J. D. Salinger, with a
heavily promoted tell-all memoir of her famous father. Peggy, an
aspiring writer, invokes ``the examined life'' as the reason for
her expose. ``I totally respect and uphold privacy,'' she told one
interviewer. ``But not an unhealthy secrecy.'' Translation: Call my
agent for movie rights.
</P>
<P>
   I have been keeping a list of people who, for the sake of a
measly five-figure book contract or some similar pittance, have
sold out private or privileged relationships. Richard Nixon's
psychiatrist, we learn, was dying to write a book. Instead, he has
offloaded some curious half-truths about his famous patient onto
patho-biographer Anthony Summers.
</P>
<P>
   During the Monica Lewinsky imbroglio, the Rev. J. Philip Wogaman
released a book called ``From the Eye of the Storm _ A Pastor to
the President Speaks Out.'' On the one hand, Wogaman wanted
everyone to know that Clinton often worshiped at his Foundry United
Methodist Church in Washington. From the other side of his mouth,
Wogaman insisted that ``I would never exploit personal
relationships.'' London's fashionable pop therapist Susie Orbach
has given so many interviews praising herself for not discussing
her most famous patient, Lady Diana, princess of Wales, that _
well, draw your own conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   I have also been keeping another, more interesting list, of men
and women who did not succumb to the Salinger Impulse. Joe DiMaggio
reportedly turned down a $2 million memoir offer because he didn't
want to write about his ex-wife Marilyn Monroe. And at the margin
of recent memory stands the oft-reviled CIA director Richard Helms,
who was charged with perjury because he declined to tell a Senate
committee about the CIA's involvement in the overthrow of Chile's
Salvador Allende. After Helms plea-bargained, a federal judge fined
him $2,000, issued a suspended sentence, and said that he had
covered himself in ``disgrace and shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms's gritty silence seems quaint in an era when out-of-work
CIA station chiefs rush into print with thinly veiled roman a clefs
about their derring-do in faraway lands. But it won him many fans,
not only inside the intelligence apparat, but even one inside the
journalistic establishment. Author Thomas Powers' 1979 biography of
Helms proved surprisingly sympathetic. The title: ``The Man Who
Kept the Secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of Thomas Merton, the successful New York
author/boulevardier who left Manhattan for a life of silent
contemplation at the abbey of Gethsemani in central Kentucky, is
quite well known, through profiles, biographies, and his
best-selling spiritual autobiography ``The Seven Storey Mountain.''
Less known is that during his years as the Trappist monk Brother
Louis, Merton had a sexual affair with a young woman in Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   Merton's furtive phone calls to Louisville were monitored, and
he was forced to confess his transgression to his abbot. He
remained at Gethsemani, and the affair ended. Washington Post
writer Paul Hendrickson picks up the sequel: ``Margie Smith went
back to Ohio and married a doctor and raised sons. In all these
years, she has never once spoken publicly of Merton. Even Michael
Mott, the authorized biographer . . . never met her (They spoke on
the phone.) . . . She has declined to become part of a culture in
America that would reward somebody with millions for writing a book
titled ``I Was Thomas Merton's Secret Love.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, I tried to interview a woman once named Ann
Adden, with whom the poet Robert Lowell had a brief affair in the
1950s. He dedicated _ and later un-dedicated _ several beautiful
poems to her, and her name still survives in one poem from the
``Notebook 1967-1968'' collection. It's not hard to find her, but
there's no evidence that she wants to discuss Lowell. Neither of
his biographers records a conversation with her, and my own letter
vanished into the wilds.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I felt thwarted, maybe even a little hurt; how could
someone doubt my motives? But I also admired her for keeping her
peace. Silence has an eloquence that sometimes speaks louder than
words.

&HT;     ACURA'S OWN SUV TO DEBUT NEXT MONTH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Acura finally is doing its own SUV thing.
</P>
<P>
   After several years of selling a rebadged version of the Isuzu
Trooper as the Acura SLX sport-utility vehicle, Honda's luxury-car
division has decided to produce its own premium sport-utility
vehicle, designed from the ground up as an Acura.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there really wasn't anything wrong with the SLX,
seeing as though it was based on the outstanding Trooper, one of my
all-time favorites.
</P>
<P>
   But it really wasn't an Acura or a Honda, and you can
understand, I'm sure, that this high-quality Japanese automaker
wants to design and build its own cars rather than using someone
else's.
</P>
<P>
   Honda and Isuzu have been trading products for several years,
and at least one of those trades will continue: Honda sells a
version of the compact Isuzu Rodeo SUV as the Honda Passport.
</P>
<P>
   Isuzu _ which no longer builds cars, just trucks _ did sell a
version of the Honda Odyssey minivan, called the Oasis, but when
Honda redesigned the Odyssey in 1999, it decided not to share the
new vehicle with Isuzu.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why Isuzu won't be sharing its new Trooper with
Acura when the redesigned Trooper comes out in a year or so.
Perhaps that's one reason Acura chose to develop its own SUV now.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the MDX is on the way to Acura dealers and
will make its nationwide debut Oct. 5 as a 2001 model, with a price
beginning in the mid-$30,000s (about the same as the SLX).
</P>
<P>
   This is Acura's first attempt at designing a truck product from
scratch, and from all appearances, it's a great effort.
</P>
<P>
   Acura promises ``a full-featured luxury SUV that delivers
exhilarating performance.'' It was designed by Honda's Los Angeles
and Ohio research-and-development centers and will be built in
Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the new full-size SUVs that have come out recently
or are arriving this fall, the MDX adds a third row of seats that
wasn't offered in the SLX.
</P>
<P>
   As sport-utilities have increasingly taken the place of minivans
for a lot of consumers, that third seat has been in great demand.
SUVs that offer the third seat have had quite an edge on their
competitors. Many buyers had been choosing the Ford Expedition and
Lincoln Navigator over the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon, for
instance, but for 2000 a third seat option was added to the
Tahoe/Yukon.
</P>
<P>
   The MDX will seat up to seven people, and also will offer
``outstanding all-weather handling, class-leading fuel-economy,
ultra-low emissions and an expected five-star safety rating,''
Acura says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MDX is a no-compromise SUV,'' Acura Executive Vice
President Dick Colliver said. ``It is the first luxury
sport-utility vehicle to deliver both the sport and the utility
customers desire in one thoroughly refined package.''
</P>
<P>
   It is powered by an all-aluminum 3.5-liter, 24-valve V-6 engine
featuring Honda's patented VTEC variable valve-timing system,
connected to a five-speed automatic transmission. The engine is
rated at 240 horsepower and 245 foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   Also standard will be Acura's new ``variable torque management''
four-wheel-drive system, which uses advanced electronic sensing and
control mechanisms to monitor the drive wheels and to apply power
to wheels as necessary to prevent spin. A unique locking feature,
activated by a button on the dash, sends maximum power to the rear
wheels for use in low-speed, low-traction situations.
</P>
<P>
   All MDX models meet California's new ultra-low-emissions-vehicle
standards, and have EPA estimated fuel economy of 17 miles per
gallon in the city and 23 mpg on the highway _ the best in the
class.
</P>
<P>
   The second and third rows of seats split and fold flat into the
floor to accommodate a wide variety of passenger and cargo
configurations, and all seating positions have headrests as well as
three-point seatbelts.
</P>
<P>
   Other safety features include dual-threshold front air bags,
seatbelt pre-tensioners and a passenger-side air bag system that
can sense whether someone is sitting in the passenger seat.
</P>
<P>
   Standard luxury features include leather seats (first and second
row only), leather door inserts, power windows/mirrors/door locks,
power tilt and sliding sunroof, cruise control, seven-speaker
AM/FM/cassette stereo with in-dash CD player, power adjustable
heated front seats, alloy wheels and a digital trip computer.
</P>
<P>
   Options include a touring package that adds a two-position
driver's seat and mirror memory system, eight-way power adjustable
passenger seat, roof rack, reverse-mode tilting passenger-side
mirror, exclusive alloy wheel design, and an upgraded 200-watt,
eight-speaker Bose audio system with six-disc in-dash CD changer.
</P>
<P>
   The Acura GPS navigation system will be offered as a stand-alone
option.

BIOTECH R&AMP;D, BUT WITHOUT A LAB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NAOMI AOKI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Newbury Street is better known for its salons than its
science. But nestled among the cafes and art galleries Dr. Marc E.
Lanser spends his days pursuing breakthroughs in the diagnosis of
conditions such as Parkinson's disease and attention-deficit
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his neighbors, however, Lanser and his company,
Boston Life Sciences, are a bit unconventional. In Lanser's case,
that means having founded a 15-employee biotechnology firm that has
only one floor of rented space, no laboratory, and no research
scientists on staff.
</P>
<P>
   Call it virtual biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   Investors and colleagues were skeptical when Boston Life
Sciences Inc. started in 1992. The company struggled to raise just
$3 million in seed money. Eight years later, its prospects have
brightened:
</P>
<P>
   It recently raised $10 million in capital, almost doubling its
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   It is working to get Food and Drug Administration approval for
its first product, and if approved, the product, a diagnostic agent
for Parkinson's disease, would lead the company quickly into
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   And it has six more products in its pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel vindicated,'' said Lanser, the company's chief
scientific officer.
</P>
<P>
   When Boston Life Sciences started, it had a staff of four:
Lanser, a chief operating officer, a vice president, and a
bookkeeper. The company added two more in the first year. Over
time, the staff has grown to 15, including four people to manage
ongoing clinical trials and two to handle regulatory issues.
</P>
<P>
   The staff picks the technology and shepherds it from lab to
marketplace. But they turn to others to do the work: There are
contracts with Harvard University researchers to develop the
product in its rawest form. Contracts with outside labs for animal
testing and human clinical trials, with manufacturers to make the
drugs. And eventually, there will be contracts to market the
products.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Lanser has argued that the business model
makes perfect sense, especially for a biotech start-up. A decade
ago, most biotech companies were built around one piece of
promising science. They'd spend upward of $2 million to build a
lab, buy equipment, and hire researchers. They'd spend millions
more testing a drug. And if the drug failed, the company crashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a graveyard littered with biotech companies that had
that one great product,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With several products in the pipeline, Lanser reasoned, he could
spread the risk. If one failed, he had others to fall back on. But
it would be virtually impossible for a start-up to raise enough
capital to build lab space and hire researchers for five or six
projects. So Lanser came up with another business model _ one that
didn't require so much overhead and that allowed him to run
multiple projects.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of spending the company's capital on facilities and
payroll, Lanser spent it on research, by paying organizations that
already had the facilities and people to do the work. If a project
didn't pass a certain phase of testing, he could cancel it without
having to fire people or sell equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The company survived its first two years on less than $5
million. Over the years, it has raised about $55 million and now
has a cash reserve of $22 million. The company spends about $9
million a year, more than $5 million of which goes to research and
development.
</P>
<P>
   If Altropane is approved by the FDA late next year, as Lanser
predicts, it would be the only drug on the market designed
specifically to screen for Parkinson's. It would help doctors
detect the disease earlier and more accurately. And it would tap
into a $100 million to $125 million market.
</P>
<P>
   Lanser expects to make $30 million in the first full year of
sales, a small amount when compared to the billion-dollar proceeds
of blockbuster drugs from big pharmaceutical companies _ but more
than enough to make Boston Life Sciences profitable. It also would
put the company in a select group of biotech companies that
actually make money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out to be a very efficient way to run things,''
Lanser said. ``I think we've proven the model can work.''
</P>
<P>
   While few companies depend on contracts to the extent that
Boston Life Sciences does (most have their own labs and
researchers), contracts, partnerships, and licensing deals are
common in the biotechnology industry.
</P>
<P>
   Companies contract with outside labs to augment their own
research. They enter into licensing deals with companies whose
science complements their own. They partner with big pharmaceutical
companies to benefit from their experience.
</P>
<P>
   But eight years ago, those deals weren't as common. The industry
was in its infancy. Investors and colleagues were understandably
leery about a biotech company that didn't even have its own lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds to me like they are playing on the fringes,'' one
observer said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Others questioned whether Boston Life Sciences would be able to
assure the quality of its research and keep a project on a
competitive timeline.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the concerns are valid, Lanser said. Boston Life
Sciences is just one client of many for an outside lab or
manufacturer. Sometimes, the outside organizations have conflicting
priorities. At times, they have been slower than Lanser would like.
He wanted to get Altropane to market in three or four years. So
far, it has taken seven. The industry average is 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain loss of control that we've become
comfortable with, but a lot of executives would not be comfortable
with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A certain loss of control does not translate into a lack of
scrutiny, said S. David Hillson, the company's chief executive. The
staff designs the preclinical and clinical trials for all projects.
They contract with labs that have expertise in the project area _
whether it be nerve growth factors for treating stroke and spinal
cord injury, or antiangiogenic proteins for the treatment of solid
cancer. Staff members routinely call and visit the labs.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Goldberg, chief executive of New Drug Associates Inc., a
Framingham biotech company with a business model similar to Boston
Life Sciences', likes the model. He said it's leaner, more
flexible, and if managed correctly, faster.
</P>
<P>
   When starting a project, the company doesn't wait to build the
lab, hire the people, or gain in-house expertise, Goldberg said. It
can simply contract with the best people. And if contracts are
well-coordinated _ so a drug that is ready on Tuesday, for example,
is shipped directly to a lab for testing Thursday _ there is no
downtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates a much more nimble company,'' he said. ``And it's
something that is beginning to look interesting to people. We're at
the front edge of the wave.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Opel, an analyst at the Boston investment bank H.C.
Wainwright &AMP; Co., said more biotech companies are outsourcing
portions of their business. So last spring, when he started
following Boston Life Sciences, Opel didn't give its business model
much thought, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a major issue in my thinking,'' said Opel, who rates
the company as a buy. ``At this point, and up until now, it's been
working real well.''
</P>
<P>
   The company contracts with top scientists and does a good job of
bringing products along, he said. Testing showed that Altropane
correctly diagnosed Parkinson's in about 80 percent of patients,
exceeding the accuracy of some FDA-approved diagnostic agents for
other illnesses. The company already has an agreement with a
Canadian manufacturer to produce Altropane. Opel expects a deal
early next year with a large pharmaceutical company to market the
product.
</P>
<P>
   And if testing shows Altropane can also diagnose attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, he said, the product could generate
$500 million in annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The company has other promising products, he said, noting its
nerve growth factor, Inosine. Although it is still in animal
testing, Inosine could be used to treat victims of strokes and
spinal cord injuries.
</P>
<P>
   If all that happens, however, Boston Life Sciences might have to
change its business strategy, Opel said. With products on the
market, a company must be able to solve problems quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Research and development needs to work closely with
manufacturing; manufacturing needs to work closely with
marketing,'' he said. ``When it's all under one company, I think
there's a greater chance of the turnaround being as brief as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanser and Hillson don't envision bringing all those functions
under Boston Life Sciences' roof. But they know some change is
inevitable. The company will need additional staff in coming years
to manage its increasing number of clinical trials and related
regulatory issues. As it becomes profitable, it will put more
products into the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   More remarkable, however, are the company's plans to add a
laboratory, albeit a small one, and three researchers to study
protein purification. Lanser said he is spending about $200,000 on
the lab because he hasn't been satisfied with the quality of
resarch available in that area.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning, the business model as been dictated by the
recognition that science makes the company,'' Hillson said. ``And
in the end, science will continue to dictate how we run the
company.''

THE GUCCI SAGA: SHOES, AND SOME SPIKES

THE HOUSE OF GUCCI 
A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness, Glamour, and Greed 
By Sara Gay Forden. Morrow. 351pp. $26. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The average consumer knows perhaps only a few key things about
Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer either owned one of the designer's purses with an
all-over double G pattern in the 1980s or had the next best thing:
a fake. Then the company seemingly disappeared, until a few years
ago, and now, you either wear the luxury retailer's horse-bit
loafers, thought to have first been created in the 1950s, or think
they're showy and overpriced.
</P>
<P>
   But there's much more to know.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Gucci, from its Florentine roots to the relaunch of
its Madison Avenue flagship store that opened this week, is
complicated and often dramatic, as Italian stories often are.
</P>
<P>
   The sordid tale spans false legend about the company's
beginnings (they were not saddlemakers for aristocrats), bitter
family fueds (which sent pocketbooks flying out of boardroom
windows, and much worse), near-financial collapse (thanks to the
Asian economic crisis), hostile-takeover attempts (by Prada and
others), a murder (of a Gucci), a conviction (of his wife), and the
meteoric rise of one of the world's hottest designers (Tom Ford).
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Gay Forden, the former Milan bureau chief for Women's Wear
Daily, had covered the many twists and turns of the company,
including the 1995 homicide of Maurizio Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   Several years earlier, he had secretly wrested control of the
company away from other family members in an attempt to restore
some of its lustre. But ultimately, he sold out under pressure to
investment bankers Investcorp in 1993 when financial prospects
looked grim. Just as he tried settling into a new life away from
the company, he was slain.
</P>
<P>
   In tragic operatic fashion, his life ended shortly before Ford
rolled out the Spring 1996 line that had fashion writers all but
using exclamation points in their reports. After a year of mounting
praise, it was the show that gave Gucci a much needed kick start,
lending gravitas to the style-setter the world knows today.
</P>
<P>
   However, Forden's book, ``The House of Gucci: A Sensational
Story of Murder, Madness, Glamour and Greed,'' is more about the
rebirth of a brand than the death of a Gucci, which is unfortunate
_ but not because the company's history is dull. Far from it.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that the chapters describing how Patrizia Reggiani
Gucci plotted to kill her ex-husband are so grippingly bizarre that
one wishes there were even more details about her consultations
with fortune tellers, her employ of potions and spells, her network
of spies, the bumbling group she lined up to do the hit, her
over-the-top fashion sense and her quick takeover _ after she had
him killed _ of the sumptuous Milan quarters which Maurizio Gucci
had just furnished for himself and his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently suffering from a ``narcissistic personality
disorder,'' according to the judge presiding over her trial,
Patrizia plotted to kill the father of their two daughters after
years of separation, just as she suspected he was going to marry
his live-in girlfriend. ``In his wife's eyes, he committed a
unpardonable wrong: Maurizio Gucci had stripped her, through their
divorce, of formidable patrimony and an internationally recognized
name _ and the accompanying status, benefits, luxuries, and
prerogatives,'' the judge wrote in his decision. ``Patrizia
Reggiani did not intend to give these up.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even after she was arrested. Forden writes that Reggiani
Gucci adorned herself in fur and gold as she braced for the police
interrogation, despite being told such possessions would be
confiscated behind bars. The day a hired gun pumped a bullet into
his Gucci's head, she drew a one-word entry in her diary:
``PARADEISOS.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the daily life of Gucci, the company, had been anything but
paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Guccio Gucci fled his parents Florence home and their failing
straw hat company around the turn of the 20th century, landing a
job at London's Savoy Hotel, where famous guests had luxurious
leather luggage. Or so another family legend goes. His first job
back in Florence was at a leather goods company, where he learned
the trade, that glamorous baggage on his mind, before opening his
own such firm in 1921.
</P>
<P>
   Guccio Gucci's children, and their children, would one day rule
the Gucci dynasty, splintering the company into factions, and
struggling for control, or for a larger share of the pie or for
respect, as happens with so many family businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The telling of those struggles is more of straight news
accounting than a psychological soap opera, a flaw that slows the
book down. Also, the book dwells more on the earlier days of the
company than its post-1995 explosion of prosperity, a period that
could have been explored more.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this being a story that could seemingly write itself,
Forden's account seems as if she, too, is trudging through some of
the material, especially when dealing with financial details in the
thick midsection of the book. Elsewhere, even with the rich subject
matter at hand, Forden sometimes overreaches and misses the mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bright red blood spatters formed Jackson Pollack-like patterns
on the doors and the white walls on either side of the entryway
where Maurizio lay,'' goes the opening paragraph in the chapter
about Gucci's murder. Maybe that's the way it looked. But the story
of the Guccis is overwrought enough.

   Is Dick Cheney, George W. Bush's vice presidential choice, on to
something? In this post-Cold War era, when individual terrorists
seem to pose more of a security threat than hostile armies, a
campaign debate over old-fashioned military preparedness feels like
a nonstarter for the swing voters supposedly ready to decide the
election on the price of drugs and the quality of schools.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the ominous ``Peace for Our Time?'' essay in the September
issue of Commentary magazine by historians Donald and Frederick W.
Kagan suggests we ought to worry a lot more about the next war.
Desperate to shatter America's global nonchalance, the writers
compare the current US situation to that of the powerful but unwary
Britain after World War I. Lulled into a false sense of security,
the English stumbled into crises involving Iraq (ironically
enough), Turkey, and Italy, eventually emboldening a rearming
Germany into concluding that ``the English were not willing to risk
a fight even for their self-proclaimed vital interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The litany of fears _ Saddam Hussein still in Iraq, flashpoints
in the Balkans and in Korea, too much reliance on the UN, and a
weakening of US will and firepower _ seems a little too ordinary to
instill much fear. So the authors settle on a more effective
method: Behind every silver lining lies a dark cloud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sky seems blue, as blue as it did for England'' they warn,
so beware the turn of the geopolitical wheel. Now here's a foreign
policy paradigm that the nation can buy: We're due for some bad
luck.

   With Election Day looming, the Clinton legacy is sure to be
batted around with growing intensity. The September/October issue
of Mother Jones magazine lets two lefties dissect the man who moved
both Democrats and Republicans to the middle. Speaking for the
affirmative (and a tepid endorsement it is) is a Georgetown history
professor, Michael Kazin. He sifts through some successes, like the
Family and Medical Leave Act, some wedge issues, like the gay- and
abortion-rights stance, and some intangibles, like Clinton's
``galvanic empathy,'' to suggest that what the hell, he was better
for the left than Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   A darker view is taken by Christopher Hitchens, the journalist
and inveterate Clinton-basher, who flatly equates the current
president with Reagan. ``The Clinton years, in other words, have
completed and locked in the Reagan revolution,'' he writes,
assailing the president's cozying up to Wall Street, his
Kissinger-esque diplomacy, and his Dan Quayle-like preaching on
morality, movies, and school uniforms. ``In all essentials,''
Hitchens declares, ``the Clinton-Gore admininstration has been
Republican, and not all that moderate.''

   Only two issues old, dads magazine _ dubbed ``The Lifestyle
Magazine For Today's father _ has garnered favorable reviews in
Time magazine and The New York Times. Its September/October issue
has an eye-catching cover story featuring the top ESPN anchors
Chris Berman and Dan Patrick talking about life as a modern dad.
It's apparent that both guys try hard, but the story itself is more
than a little wistful.
</P>
<P>
   Berman recalls how his father, a mechanical engineer, regularly
took his sons to New York Jets football games, not because he liked
the sport, but because he liked watching his boys watch the game.
Patrick describes his dad as an ``everyman, a normal guy'' who was
always the loudest spectator in the gym, screaming his lungs out
for his basketball-playing son. Now, fast-forward a generation.
</P>
<P>
   On fall weekends, ``when other parents are kicking back with
their children and relaxing, Berman routinely spends 14-hour days
at the studio going through highlight tapes,'' the story reports.
And given the demands of Patrick's job, he could go two or three
weeks ``without any meaningful father-child contact.'' Not
surprisingly, both dads were on the road on Father's Day 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Dan and Chris may be good guys in cool jobs. But this story
makes you long for Ward Cleaver and the 40-hour work week.

   A series of short essays on the future of rural America paints a
less than idyllic picture. Environmental writer Bill McKibben warns
about the deterioration of rural education. Atlantic Monthly
correspondent Eric Schlosser talks about the explosion in rural
prison construction. Author and livestock farmer Gene Logsdon flags
``agricultural pollution,'' a nice euphemism for what happens to
untended animal waste. Here's a hint: One night he awoke to find
his house infested by flies emanating from hens _ five miles away _
toiling for a major egg producer.

<P>
   Amy Trubek likes to use the potato as an example of the
difference between everyday French cooking and haute cuisine,
which, as the name implies, is the most elaborate cooking on the
French table. At a talk she gave recently to the students and
faculty of the New England Culinary Institute in Montpelier, Vt.,
where she teaches, she used the potato to illustrate her point. ``I
wanted to convey how much the French were committed to this idea of
mastery,'' she tells me over lunch at Boston's Maison Robert. ``A
French chef wants to show what he can do with a potato.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, almost on cue, as if the waiter had overheard Trubek
and then raced to tell Jacky Robert it was time to take a potato
and make some magic, a plate of amazingly crisp, hollow, golden
brown pommes souffles appeared. Trubek could only muster, ``That's
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The author of ``Haute Cuisine: How the French Invented the
Culinary Profession'' (University of Pennsylvania Press), Trubek is
usually more articulate, especially on her favorite subject. The
book begins with the origins of French cooking and examines it
through the appearance of restaurants and the training of chefs,
then and now. ``Haute cuisine'' was the subject of Trubek's
doctoral dissertation in anthropology. (A dissertation on French
cooking? Raised eyebrows went with that pronouncement.) Trubek, 37,
says, ``I was not a mainstream student.'' But she understood French
cuisine from both sides of the plate _ as a professionally trained
cook and as an interested diner.
</P>
<P>
   To take a less academic but nevertheless scholarly look at the
subject, we decided to meet at Maison Robert and, course by course,
examine a traditional French meal. On a sweltering day last month,
Jacky Robert agreed to make a series of courses right out of
Escoffier. Like all cooks with classic French training, Robert (who
did an apprenticeship at Prunier in Paris, then worked at Maxim's)
still feels the influence of the late-19th-century chef and his
writings.
</P>
<P>
   Auguste Escoffier's meals consisted of many courses, including
both fish and meat. Robert followed Escoffier tradition but pared
down the number of courses. He made a tiny nibble of crabmeat in
pastry to begin the meal, then a dish of feathery quenelles (airy
fishcakes), then a classic molded squab with sauteed cabbage.
</P>
<P>
   It was after the squab _ and before a nectarine charlotte
dessert _ that Robert sent the pommes soufflees to the table. Most
cooks, says Trubek, think that ``a potato is a potato is a
potato.'' But the technique for making pommes soufflees, she says,
is one of the trickiest in the French repertoire, requiring two
deep-fat baths. Even the initial handling of the potato requires
tremendous skill. ``It has to be cut to a certain thinness and a
certain bias,'' she explains. ``Then you fry it once at a low
temperature, once at a higher temperature.''
</P>
<P>
   And voila! The potatoes form a crust the first time, without
cooking through. The second, hotter frying steams the center of the
potato, which opens to form hollows. ``You have to be ready to
waste alot of potatoes,'' Robert explainslater, when he joins us at
the table.
</P>
<P>
   Pommes soufflees belong to haute cuisine not only because of the
risk in making them, but also because they have an extravagant
feeling. Only a kitchen with extra manpower can afford to allow a
cook to hover over one serving of potatoes at the last minute.
Skill and attention show in every single little oval puff.
</P>
<P>
   All you have to do is look at a plate of food, says Trubek, to
tell the social and economic standing of the person who is going to
consume it. Traditionally in France, the upper classes ate fine
cooking, while the poorest people drank watery soup. ``In France
during the medieval period,'' she writes, ``the peasantry subsisted
chiefly on bread. Though of France, their food had no real
resemblance to French haute cuisine.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitchen workers formed the bridge between the working class and
the wealthy patrons. The apprenticeship system, in which young men
hardly into their teenage years went to work for little more than
room and board, gave poor boys a peek into life outside their
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role of the worker cannot be underestimated,'' Trubek
writes. ``Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, chefs made
French haute cuisine more than a convenient sign of social status
for European elites. Adopting the cuisine for their own social
purposes, chefs made it a marker of their own status as elite
culinary professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the first hint that chefs were about to become
celebrities. When they did, at the end of the last century, they
began mixing ethnic ingredients into classic French food.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting what disappears and what stays,'' says
Trubek, as Jacky Robert's tiny bouchees a la reine with crabmeat
arrive to start the meal. These puff pastry rounds, no bigger than
silver dollars, are mini versions of the vol-au-vent, a large airy
pastry round filled with seafood or poultry _ a presentation rarely
seen today. ``Certain classic dishes are impossible to find
anymore,'' Trubek says.
</P>
<P>
   Quenelles are another of these lost dishes. Tasting Robert's two
kinds of fish mousse shaped into ovals and poached gently, Trubek
compares the two. One is made the old way, with pureed fish
combined with beef suet, bound with a panade _ in this case, cream
puff dough made quite firm. The newer quenelle contains only salmon
and cream in equal proportions. Trubek is surprised. ``I'm amazed
at how different they taste,'' she says. Rather than being heavy
and unpalatable from the suet and binding, the old technique's
result is a light, airy quenelle, one that suggests egg whites. And
the flavor is beautiful. ``You can taste the fish more,'' says
Trubek. In contrast, the modern quenelle is chewy. ``Almost
spongy,'' says Trubek. ``And the fish flavor isn't as strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert's glacage, a faintly pink, thin sauce made from lobster
bodies, cream, and yolks _ with a hint of heat from cayenne pepper
_ is another lost technique. The classic method dictates that the
chef slide the dish of quenelles and glacage under a salamander
right before sending it to the table, Robert tells us, so the edges
brown slightly and the dish stays hot.
</P>
<P>
   Many modern chefs remember making quenelles during their
training. Trubek wonders how many know the molded dish chartreuse,
the 17th-century specialty first made for the vegetarian Carthusian
monks. ``Careme brought it to the classic French repertoire,'' says
Robert.
</P>
<P>
   He has made individual chartreuses in souffle dishes, combining
braised cabbage and bacon with sauteed squab. Standing around the
edge are tiny rectangles, like a miniature deck of cards cut from
turnip, carrot, and leek. In the vegetarian tradition, he likes to
use what's available and sometimes sprinkles the edges with peas
and corn. His squab are rare, in keeping with today's style
(Escoffier would probably shudder). Trubek loves this dish, its
mildly smoky cabbage, the tender succulent squab tucked inside. She
also likes the fact that it is so flavorful.
</P>
<P>
   Student cooks at New England Culinary Institute are no longer
taught to follow Escoffier blindly, she says. Today, chefs ``don't
think they have an obligation to the whole system.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at Alice Waters saying, `I'm going to take some
aspects of this system, but I'm not going to do a lot of it.' ''
Waters's interpretations made Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif., one
of the most innovative restaurants in the country.
</P>
<P>
   But tradition is still an important part of a culinary
education. So is taste. Students at New England Culinary Institute
are introduced to a whole range of foods and flavors, Trubek says,
because when they begin, ``some have no sense of what goes
together.''
</P>
<P>
   People are often drawn to cooking not because of a long-held
passion, she says, but because the kitchen is perceived as a good
place to work and a steady income. They often learn taste at
school, says Trubek, and they get their passion as students.
</P>
<P>
   She learned good taste at home in Madison, Wis., because her
parents were passionate about food. She tells a story in ``Haute
Cuisine'' about going to the celebrated Le Francais restaurant
outside Chicago when she was 20 and being bowled over by the
copper, plush seating, and attentive waiters. ``I knew this was a
world I must explore,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   After Haverford College, Trubek came to Cambridge to work at Sue
Small's The Peacock restaurant. Small, who trained at London's
Cordon Bleu School of Cookery, encouraged Trubek to follow suit.
After London, Trubek began a master's program in anthropology at
the University of Pennsylvania. ``I wanted to become a food
writer,'' she says. ``But I stayed to get a PhD. I wanted to look
at food from a cultural perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Haute cuisine ``was a little controversial,'' she says. ``It was
not the fashion of the times in anthropology.'' There was no
precedent in studying culinary professionals, she says.
Anthropologists tended to look at food in exotic cultures. For help
and direction, she turned to Concord food historian Barbara
Wheaton, an authority on French cooking, who is honorary curator of
the culinary collection at Radcliffe's Schlesinger Library. Trubek
spent hours at the library delving through the collection.
</P>
<P>
   She learned about trends in haute cuisine, how plates began to
have a certain look, how chefs changed their styles. Everything had
a place, foods had natural partners, and there was a certain way to
do everything in the kitchen. Cooking was codified. Filet of beef
steaks automatically meant the creamy potato dish, pommes
dauphinois. If you wanted to make a julienne strip, she writes (as
she learned at the London Cordon Bleu), you cut the vegetable into
1 1/2-inch-long pieces, then cut those into thin slices, then cut
the slices into strips.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs began veering away from classic combinations at the end of
the last century, Trubek says. But where does that leave classic
French cooking?
</P>
<P>
   If it disappears entirely, it would be a world without
charlottes. We are eating individual charlottes, which are small
rounds of pureed essence of nectarine mixed with gelatin and
whipped cream, circled with crisp ``spoon cookies,'' a cousin of
ladyfingers, but airier. Each plate is garnished with a miniature
marzipan nectarine that looks so real, at first glance two informed
diners can't figure out how Robert found such tiny fruit.
</P>
<P>
   This is Trubek's era _ classic food slightly updated to account
for new ingredients. ``What people underestimate is the mastery,''
she says. ``I'm not a conservative person. But today there's no
sense of what goes together. Great cooks and chefs keep some form
of mastery as their goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think?'' she asks. ``If someone opened a
restaurant and served this food, would anyone come?''
</P>
<P>
   Jacky Robert thinks ``there are some great ideas to take from
the classic.''
</P>
<P>
   Trubek agrees. ``When was the last time you got pommes soufflees
at a restaurant?'' she asks.

   Toss together the sugar and finely chopped pistachios, mixing
well, and spread the mixture on a work surface.
</P>
<P>
   Roll each piece of dough in the mixture to form a log. The logs
should be a couple of inches shorter than the sheet pan and about 2
inches wide.
</P>
<P>
   Bake the logs on the prepared pan at 350 degrees until firm to
the touch, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool.
</P>
<P>
   Set the oven at 300 degrees. Cut each log on the diagonal into
1/2-inch-wide pieces. Lay each piece on its flat side on the baking
sheet. Bake at 300 degrees until the biscotti are firm in the
center and lightly toasted on top, about 10 minutes.

GINGERBREAD &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The unusually dark and somewhat sticky cake produced by this
recipe goes beautifully with espresso. From ``Beard on Bread''
(Knopf, 1973).
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup light or dark molasses
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup boiling water
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 to 2 teaspoons ground ginger
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   2 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   2 or 3 tablespoons chopped candied ginger (optional)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Put the molasses in a mixing bowl, add the boiling water and
butter, and stir until well mixed. Add the salt, ground ginger, and
soda and stir lightly. Then stir in just enough of the 2 cups flour
to moisten and mix the ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the batter into a 9-by-9-by-2-inch baking pan. If desired,
sprinkle the candied ginger on top. Bake at 375 degrees for 25 to
35 minutes (or a few minutes longer if you've used the candied
ginger), or until the top springs back when pressed lightly and the
bread pulls away from the sides of the pan. Cut into 9 to 12
squares.

TIRAMISU &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although this Italian concoction has recently been eclipsed in
popularity by creme brulee, few desserts can match its wonderful
blend of flavors. Instead of the Pan di Spagna called for below,
you can use poundcake or ladyfingers. From Nick Malgieri's ``Great
Italian Desserts'' (Little, Brown, 1990).
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the Pan di Spagna:
</P>
<P>
   4 large eggs, separated
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   Pinch salt
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the espresso syrup:
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup water
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup very strong brewed espresso
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup Italian or other brandy
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the zabaione filling:
</P>
<P>
   3 large egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup sweet Marsala
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound mascarpone, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup heavy whipping cream
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the garnish:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy whipping cream
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   Ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   Ground coffee or unsweetened cocoa powder
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To prepare the Pan di Spagna: Butter and line with wax paper or
parchment a 9- or 10-inch round cake pan that is 2 inches deep.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the vanilla.
Whisk in half the sugar and continue to beat until very light and
frothy, about 5 minutes, either by hand, with a hand mixer set at
medium, or in a heavy-duty mixer fitted with the whip.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the flour and cornstarch and sift once to aerate the
mixture.
</P>
<P>
   In a clean, dry bowl, beat the egg whites with the salt until
they hold a very soft peak, either by hand, with a hand mixer set
at medium, or in a heavy-duty mixer fitted with the whip. Beating
faster, add the remaining sugar in a very slow stream, beating
until the egg whites hold a firm peak.
</P>
<P>
   Fold the yolk mixture into the whites with a rubber spatula.
Sift the flour and cornstarch over the eggs in three additions,
folding them in gradually. Do not overmix.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake
at 350 degrees for 30 to 40 minutes, until it is well risen and
feels firm when pressed gently with your palm.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately loosen the layer from the sides of the pan with a
small knife or spatula. Invert the layer onto a rack, leaving the
paper stuck to it. Turn the layer right side up and cool it on a
rack.
</P>
<P>
   For the espresso syrup: Combine the sugar and water in a
saucepan and bring to a boil. Cool and stir in the espresso and
brandy.
</P>
<P>
   For the zabaione filling: Beat the egg yolks in the bowl of an
electric mixer or another heat-proof bowl and beat in the sugar and
Marsala. Whisk over over a pan of simmering water until thickened.
Remove and beat, either with a hand mixer set at medium, or in a
heavy-duty mixer fitted with the whip, until cold. Smash the
mascarpone in a bowl with a rubber spatula until it is smooth. Fold
in the zabaione. Whip the cream and fold it in.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble: Cut the Pan di Spagna into vertical slices about
1/4 inch thick. Place a layer of the slices in the bottom of a
shallow 2-quart dish, such as a gratin dish, and soak with
one-third of the espresso syrup, using a brush. Spread with half
the zabaione filling. Repeat with Pan di Spagna, another third of
the syrup, and the remaining filling. Place a last layer of Pan di
Spagna on the top and soak with the remaining syrup.
</P>
<P>
   To decorate: Whip the heavy whipping cream with the sugar until
it holds its shape and spread it on the surface of the dessert.
Sprinkle with ground cinnamon and ground coffee or unsweetened
cocoa powder. Refrigerate for several hours before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 12.

</P>
<P>
   Warning: This spectacularly rich dessert, a snap to make, is
only for those equal to extreme sweets. From Nick Malgieri's
``Chocolate'' (HarperCollins, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 cups heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 vanilla bean, split

<P>
   12 ounces bittersweet chocolate, cut into 1/4-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup very strong espresso
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bring the cream and sugar to a boil with the vanilla bean in a
saucepan.
</P>
<P>
   Whisk the yolks in a bowl. Whisk about a third of the boiling
cream into the yolks. Return the remaining cream to a boil and
whisk in the yolk mixture. Continue to cook, whisking constantly,
another 15 or 20 seconds, until slightly thickened.
</P>
<P>
   Strain the cream into a bowl and add the chocolate. Whisk
smooth, whisk in the espresso, and pour into 8 4- to 5-ounce
custard cups or ramekins. Refrigerate until cooled.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with whipped cream or crisp cookies. For advance
preparation, cover the pots de creme with plastic wrap and
refrigerate. Uncover and leave at room temperature for an hour
before serving.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Evan Fox is like a lot of guys: He doesn't know what to wear.
</P>
<P>
   As office dress codes switched from corporate attire to business
casual, Fox traded one uniform, the business suit, for another:
khakis and polo shirts. The trouble is, khakis and polos are all he
finds himself wearing these days, unsure of what other types of
pants or shirts meet the ``casual'' qualification.
</P>
<P>
   So while his dry-cleaning bills are lower, his anxiety is
higher, and the 36-year-old computer engineer feels stuck in a
boring sartorial rut.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you wear other than a polo and khakis?'' Fox wants to
know.
</P>
<P>
   It's a question causing increasing consternation as more men
open their inter-office mail and _ with equals parts dread and
delight _ find one of those ``we're-turning-business-casual''
memos.
</P>
<P>
   The solution to Fox's boring wardrobe problem, retailers say, is
that casual dressing for work means thinking more broadly, not
pulling on clothes otherwise reserved for weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should still be wearing tailored clothing,'' says Andy
Lew, Nordstrom's East Coast men's merchandise manager. ``Not
something you'd throw in the laundry . . . The big challenge is
that the word `casual' has thrown everyone off.''
</P>
<P>
   For fall, men trading in their pinstripe suits, starched white
shirts, ties, and wingtips should opt for tailored trousers, a
shirt with more texture, maybe even a wool turtleneck, a blazer
that can be added or removed, and shoes with chunkier soles in, for
example, a matte leather or suede rather than a high polish.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, meanwhile, owns nothing of the kind.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he's got four suits hanging in the closet and each can
be traced back to his days at IBM, where he was part of the
company's field organization from 1986 to just two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But those suits rarely see the light of day anymore because Fox
is now a sales engineer working for a start-up out of his Natick
house. It's a position that seldom calls for dressing up, or
dressing at all, he slyly notes.
</P>
<P>
   He's also got four or five pairs of khakis, mostly Dockers, with
a couple pairs from Structure thrown in. For shirts, he's got polos
and oxfords. There are some corduroys in the mix, but he never
wears them, afraid they're out of style. (They're not.)
</P>
<P>
   The khaki route is also a little too casual for those first
encounters with new clients, many of whom are in retail but aren't
wearing suits themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm not real good at,'' Fox says of that vast
middle ground of wardrobing.
</P>
<P>
   Dan McCampbell, vice president of the men's fashion division at
Saks Fifth Avenue, tried to give Fox some direction on a recent
visit to the Boston store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our suggestion is, it all begins with the jacket,'' McCampbell
said. ``You're still at work, and we feel that's appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, because blazers are often the most expensive component of
business attire, workers will have fewer of them, so choosing the
right ones can provide the proper foundation for the rest of the
wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   Fox already has a navy blazer, which is a staple McCampbell said
everyone should have for dressier occasions. Beyond that, reach for
a blazer in a shade of black or in earth tones that can be worn
separately. Often, if a blazer has a textured fabric, such as a
nappy or flecked wool, or a a light plaid pattern, it can easily be
mixed and matched with different trousers. Versatility is the key.
</P>
<P>
   According to McCampbell, two or three-button jackets are the
most popular now. In other words, don't try wearing that outdated
double-breasted jacket from an old suit in this sort of casualized
ensemble. It won't work.
</P>
<P>
   After choosing a jacket _ Fox really liked a brownish wool
Canali model with a thin orange windowpane plaid _ McCampbell
recommended finding three pairs of coordinated pants.
</P>
<P>
   They included an olive wool, eventually paired with a pumpkin
flannel sports shirt and brown suede loafers; and grey flannels,
which he wore with a burgundy cotton sports shirt, an orange V-neck
sweater, and black half-boots. All the pieces were interchangeable.
Tan corduroys could also be added to the mix, making the outfits
much more laid-back.
</P>
<P>
   As for the perplexing issue of whether a shirt looks okay
without a tie, McCampbell said fabric is a key indicator. A matte
cotton, a textured fabric, or a pattern, such as plaid or check,
can easily be worn open-neck. Also, look for a less constructred
collar, avoiding shirts with collar stays, for example. And
knitwear, including turtlenecks or crewnecks in light wool,
cashmere, or silk, are also easy alternatives for fall.
</P>
<P>
   After changing out of the outfits McCampbell and his staff
chose, Fox emerged from the dressing room, back in his khakis and
black polo shirt, releasing a big sigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt better in the dressier clothes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not an unusual phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Maysonave, author of ``Casual Power: How to Power Up Your
Nonverbal Communications and Dress Down for Success,'' says
dressing too far down, as far down as khakis and polos, can send
the wrong message to clients and have an impact on the wearer's own
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they get dressed up they go more into business mode,''
Maysonave said. ``You'll actually see their posture change,'' as
Fox's did when he tried on the outfits Saks had handpicked. ``I see
it with my clients in workshops. Shoulders come down when people
put on khakis and a golf shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
CORPORATE CASUAL THIS FALL:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --TEXTURE _ Adding texture to a wardrobe is an easy way to take
the edge off business attire while still looking polished. Look for
shirts in heavy fabrics or cotton checks, as well as knit mocknecks
or turtlenecks in silk, wool, or cashmere. If a tie is still
necessary, reach for one that's woven instead of silk. Texture also
applies to blazers and socks.
</P>
<P>
   --PANTS _ Go for basic wool pants or corduroys in colors that
are easily coordinated throughout the wardrobe. Cuffs are a matter
of choice. Flat front pants are the most slenderizing.
</P>
<P>
   --JACKETS _ Choose a blazer that does not look like it's part of
a suit. Tweedy blazers or those with elbow patches work better. You
can also wear a V-neck sweater over an oxford for occasions when
blazers are not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   --FOOTWEAR _ Half-boots or shoes with a chunkier, heavy sole can
change the tone of an outfit to something more rugged or casual. So
can a woven, buckskin, suede, or matte leather shoe. The rule of
thumb is, if you can't polish it, it's casual. The same criteria
apply to belts, which, of course, should match the shoes. Even
socks _ which should always be worn _ have a way of being
casualized. Those that are thicker or subtly patterned are
considered less dressy than those solid and thin black or blue
varieties.
</P>
<P>
   --COLORS _ This fall, colors tend to be ``dusty'' blues, greens,
or roses, as well as earth tones.
</P>
<P>
   --ACCESSORIES _ Structured briefcases don't look right when the
rest of the outfit is more casual. Instead, try a carrying case in
unstructured leather or nylon. Also, techno watches made of rubber
or plastic _ which have been popular on Wall Street for the last
couple years even with the Rolex crowd _ have hit the mainstream
and may help convince younger clients that you're hip.
</P>
<P>
   --IF YOU MUST WEAR A SUIT _ For fall, the general silhouette is
a three-button jacket (which happens to be slenderizing) with a
higher lapel and flat-front pants. The leg is thinner and more
tailored. To update the suit, incorporate plaid, check, or textured
shirts and leave the double-breasted suit in the back of the
closet.

BUSH'S LOWLIFE REMARK . . . 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So much for ``love your enemies, bless them that curse you.''
George W. Bush just curses his enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is the Texas governor and presidential candidate who says
his favorite philosopher is Jesus and who claims to be able to
squeeze compassion from the stone of conservatism. Now he is
throwing stones at a reporter whom he holds in the same regard as
the serpent who suckered Adam and Eve into biting the apple.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Clymer of The New York Times has angred Bush with reporting
such as an April story on health care that began:
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas has had one of the nation's worst public health records
for decades. More than a quarter of its citizens have no health
insurance. Its Mexican border is a hotbed of contagion. The state
ranks near the top in the nation in rates of AIDS, diabetes,
tuberculosis, and teenage pregnancy and near the bottom in
immunizations, mammograms, and access to physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``But since George W. Bush became governor in 1995, he has not
made health a priority, his aides acknowledge. He has never made a
speech on the subject, his press office says.''
</P>
<P>
   Clymer's story is among the many about Bush's record on health
and the environment. In response, Bush has reached for so many fig
leaves the trees are bare. With still two months before Election
Day, this effort to hide the fact that the candidate has no clothes
has clearly taxed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of working to repair his record, the Lord Bush said unto
Clymer, ``Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all
cattle, and above every beast of the field.'' When Bush saw Clymer
at a Labor Day rally in Naperville, Ill., Bush pointed him out to
vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney and said, ``There's Adam
Clymer, major-league asshole from The New York Times.'' Cheney
responded, ``Oh yeah, he is, big time.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments were picked up and broadcast to the crowd. Bush and
Cheney said their comments were meant to be a private joke and they
did not know the microphones were turned on. You can take that
naivete for what it is worth. What was just as fascinating for
those who are contemplating a Bush presidency is how Bush responded
once he blew it.
</P>
<P>
   The honorable thing would have been to apologize to Clymer,
especially since Bush's own aides said public health was not a
priority. It might have been nice had he apologized to the crowd,
which did not come to hear a candidate vent an expletive. Instead,
Bush and Cheney played it as if the remark had no meaning at all.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said: ``It was a private comment, and I don't plan to say
anything about it.'' Bush, asked if he would apologize to Clymer,
said, ``I regret that a private comment I made to the vice
presidential candidate made it into the public airwaves. . . . I
regret people heard the comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone makes mistakes, but . . . that's it? As Jesse Jackson
knows with ``Hymietown,'' once the ``private'' becomes public,
you'd better get on your knees quick. Yet Bush and Cheney refused.
So self-assured that reporters crawl on their bellies, they did not
even bother with damage control. There was not even a lame attempt
to say ``if anyone was offended . . .'' If you heard Bush
correctly, he did not regret the comment at all; only that it was
heard.
</P>
<P>
   This makes for an interesting moment for this very holy
candidate. This is the man who proclaimed Jesus Day in Texas. This
is the man who bragged that we should elect him because ``I don't
have enemies to fight. And I have no stake in the bitter arguments
of the last few years.'' Yet he is already embittered because
reporters are not taking his word as gospel.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is running on a morality higher than President Clinton's,
swearing to ``uphold the honor and dignity of the office'' and to
restore ``discipline and decency.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``I believe in a God who calls us, not to judge our
neighbors but to love them.'' He said, ``I believe in grace,
because I have seen it . . . in forgiveness because I have needed
it. I will not attack a part of this country because I want to lead
the whole of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said, ``I've got a reason for running. I talk about a
larger goal, which is to call upon the best of America. . . . You
cannot lead America to a positive tomorrow with revenge on one's
mind. Revenge is so incredibly negative. . . . I'm going to win
because people sense my heart, know my sense of optimism.''
</P>
<P>
   This episode makes it more a question of what is in Bush's heart
_ whether he has the heart of an optimist or the heart of a Richard
Nixon compiling his enemies list. Today it may only be a reporter
who is cursed above all cattle. Tomorrow it may be a whole lot of
other folks. The Bible that Bush swears by says the truth shall
make you free. So far, it has only made him speak with a serpent's
tongue.

MORMON LEADER SEES CONTINUED GROWTH FOR HIS CHURCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In anticipation of the opening of the Mormon temple in Belmont,
Mass., Gordon B. Hinckley, the 90-year-old president of the Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, sat for an interview with the
Globe in his office in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Hinckley, who is revered as prophet, seer and revelator by the
world's 11 million Mormons, talked of the importance of the Belmont
temple, the growth of Mormonism, and various challenges facing the
church.
</P>
<P>
   Here are annotated excerpts from the interview:
</P>
<P>
   --Like many Mormons, Hinckley has done extensive genealogical
research, and his roots, like those of many church leaders, are in
New England.
</P>
<P>
   My first Hinckley ancestor came to Plymouth (from England) in
1635, and his son, Governor Thomas Hinckley, was governor of
Plymouth Colony from 1681 to 1692, except when the British imposed
Sir Edmund Andros to rule those unruly people...So if you stick my
finger, you'll find the blood is blue.
</P>
<P>
   --Hinckley's ancestors became Mormon in the 1840s, the earliest
days of the church, which was founded by Joseph Smith in western
New York.
</P>
<P>
   My great-grandfather was first taught. I don't know whether he
was baptized or not. He accepted it, but died shortly from smallpox
epidemic that raged through upper New York and Ontario, Canada...
</P>
<P>
   But my grandfather definitely was baptized. He was a young man
then, he emigrated to the United States (from Canada), and he and
his brother walked from Springfield, Ill. to Nauvoo (Ill.) where he
met Joseph Smith and joined the church.
</P>
<P>
   --The Mormons built temples very slowly over much of their
history, but, at Hinckley's urging, picked up the pace dramatically
over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   We've been building temples furiously. I made a statement in
conference in '98 that I hoped we could reach the construction of
100 working temples in the year 2000, and we've been building them
furiously, but without any sacrifice of quality...We build a great
many meetinghouses _ we have over 12,000 of them scattered across
the world, and we'll have 100 working temples when the Boston
temple is dedicated.
</P>
<P>
   --Asked how many temples the church would build, Hinckley spoke
of his own mortality.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know. I'm getting old. My eyes grow dim. I'm 90 years
old. My only brother died yesterday at 88 years of age. We're going
to go on building temples, perhaps not as rapidly as we've done
this year, but we'll go on building temples. I like to see temples
constructed so that they're near to the people.
</P>
<P>
   --The Mormon temple has attracted the opposition of a handful of
neighbors, who are waging two legal battles against the church.
</P>
<P>
   It's rankled some of our neighbors, we're sorry to say. We don't
mean to offend anybody. We think that when the temple's up and
running that that antagonism will largely disappear. That's been on
our experience in very many places.
</P>
<P>
   --Hinckley said he very much wants to see a steeple, with a
statue of the Mormon angel Moroni, on the Belmont temple. The
steeple has been blocked by a state judge.
</P>
<P>
   The steeple, of course, represents an upward reach to heaven. It
carries with it the spirit and attitude of looking heavenward. Now,
I'm disappointed that we don't have the steeple on there at this
time. I don't know why that's become such a controversial thing; I
can't understand it.
</P>
<P>
   --What is the importance of temples?
</P>
<P>
   Temples fill a unique place. Temples are not houses of public
worship, as we've indicated. They are houses in which sacred
ordinances are administered. The temple stands as a reminder to the
world of the belief of our people in the immortality of the human
soul.
</P>
<P>
   All that takes place in a temple is based on our belief that
life goes on after death, that the human soul is immortal...We
wouldn't need a temple for marriages if we believed that the
desirable way of marriage was to have someone pronounce the
ceremony ending with the words, `Till death do ye part.' That
becomes a pronouncement of separation at death.
</P>
<P>
   --Where is the church heading?
</P>
<P>
   It's heading upward, nearly 11 million strong now, and that will
continue. There's no doubt in my mind at all concerning that.
</P>
<P>
   We're equipped. We're so organized that we can handle whatever
numbers come into the church. We face two great problems in this
church, one really, but it has two facets to it: growth. The two
parts of that are...building houses of worship, and training local
leadership....It's a big task, a big responsibility, a big
challenge, but we think we're meeting it.
</P>
<P>
   --Why is the church growing?
</P>
<P>
   Because it's true.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that it appeals to people, it provides people an
anchor of faith and certainty in a changing world that for the most
part is going downhill.
</P>
<P>
   The family, for instance. You can't deny the fact that the
family across the world is falling apart. It's a tragedy. It's a
terrible thing.
</P>
<P>
   This church puts great emphasis on the family. We teach of the
sanctity of the family, we teach the sanctity of marriage, we teach
the sanctity of children, of the importance of parents who love and
nurture their children.
</P>
<P>
   --What is like to be a prophet?
</P>
<P>
   It means a very great deal and it's a very humbling thing. It
means leadership. It means responsiblity. It means work. It means
prayer. It means faith.
</P>
<P>
   ...I think this temple building program is prophetic. I feel
it's inspired. I know it's for a purpose and I believe that the
Lord is pleased with what we're doing.
</P>
<P>
   --How do you explain the belief in God and Jesus as separate
individuals?
</P>
<P>
   We believe in God, the eternal father, and in his son, Jesus
Christ, and in the Holy Ghost...Three distinct individuals, working
together for the accomplishment of the grand purpose of the
Almighty, to bring to pass the immortality and the eternal life of
his children.
</P>
<P>
   --Are Mormons becoming a part of mainstream religion in America?
</P>
<P>
   We haven't lost our distinctiveness. We have not set aside the
uniqueness of our doctrine, our organization, or our practices. We,
I, think are probably doing a better job of communicating with
others, which I think leads to that perception.
</P>
<P>
   --Will there ever be women priests in the Mormon church?
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what's going to happen in the future, but insofar
as I can see, no. The women have their place, and it's a tremendous
place. I think there's no other organization in the world that
fosters a stronger program for women than does this church...They
have a voice in determining policy and doing many things in the
church...I haven't found any complaint among our women. I'm sure
there are a few, a handful somewhere who may be disaffected for one
reason or another, but I've never seen any evidence of it. My wife
and I seem to keep talking after 63 years of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   --What about the treatment of church dissidents?
</P>
<P>
   We don't have serious difficulties with these things. One year I
think there were four or five people excommunicated and to read the
papers you'd think the whole church had come down. Actually, while
there were four or five excommunicants here in Utah, there were
about 5,000 convert baptisms here in Utah, so those things become
minuscule when you put them in context.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
QUESTION OF THE WEEK &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Please tell me what happened in the Sheila Kennedy annulment
proceedings. What was the final outcome?
</P>
<P>
   R.B.Q., Minneapolis
</P>
<P>
   A. Believe it or not, seven years after it began the Kennedy
annulment case is still unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Rauch Kennedy is the ex-wife of former U.S. Rep. Joseph
P. Kennedy II. The two divorced in 1991, and two years later Rep.
Kennedy sought an annulment from the Catholic church, which would
allow him to get remarried in the church and continue to receive
the sacrament of communion.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheila Kennedy, who was raised Episcopalian, objected,
saying she was offended by the notion that declaring the marriage
null would mean the couple's sons were children of an unsanctified
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The Archdiocese of Boston sided with Rep. Kennedy, agreeing to
annul the marriage in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But in the church, annulments must be approved by two panels.
Sheila Kennedy appealed the annulment to the Vatican's judicial
arm, and that body has not yet responded to her appeal, so the
marriage has not been annulled.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican faces no deadline for action, according to the
Archdiocese of Boston.

HOSPITAL GROUP TO KEEP PATIENT SURVEY SECRET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The results of a major survey on what patients think is
right or wrong with Massachusetts hospitals will not be made public
because of worries about how it was conducted.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to keep the findings secret was disclosed in a
letter mailed to hospitals late last week by the Massachusetts
Hospital Association in which it warned that any public release of
the institutions' scores in the survey ``would be misleading and
improper.'' The survey, only the third of its kind, was intended to
help consumers choose a hospital and measure what, if any,
improvements hospitals have made since 1998, when a similar
patient-satisfaction survey was made public.
</P>
<P>
   The MHA said it feared the findings are tainted because of
troubles in preparing the survey, which is due to be released to
hospitals this fall. Bay State hospitals remain committed to their
first-in-the-nation bid to publicly respond to patient complaints,
the letter says, but it contends that effort has been dealt a blow
by ``widespread confusion, disappointment and frustration'' over
the survey, which was conducted by Boston's Picker Institute and
paid for by the hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The survey mixups could reflect deep-seated problems at Picker,
a highly regarded nonprofit organization that has conducted similar
surveys for groups ranging from General Motors Corp. to the US
Department of Defense. They also could prove extensive and
embarrassing to the Boston-based CareGroup hospital network that is
one of Picker's biggest financial backers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public reporting only works when the information is valid and
fair, and there were enough questions about the validity and
fairness of this data that no one felt comfortable about releasing
it publicly,'' says Andrew Dreyfus, executive vice president of the
hospital association. ``We're disappointed because we're so proud
of this project and we think hospitals have worked hard to improve
care.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Delbanco, who chaired the Picker Institute when it was
founded in 1987 and still oversees its European operations, adds
that ``it would be a tragedy if a problem with our delivering
(survey) services dilutes the really important message that the
Picker adventure has brought to the nation _ of the importance of
listening to patients, learning from them, and working with them to
improve care.''
</P>
<P>
   Picker's origins go back nearly 25 years to when Harvey and Jean
Picker decided to make patient-centered care the new focus of their
family foundation, created with revenues from the sale of America's
first X-ray machines. In 1987 they launched a modest research
organization devoted to finding out what mattered to patients and
how to measure whether hospitals were delivering. The measures
worked so well that the Picker Institute was launched in 1994 to
conduct surveys and, over the last six years, it has administered
questionnaires to more than 500,000 patients.
</P>
<P>
   Picker's problems began two years ago, when it decided it needed
tighter control over data collection than it got from outside
contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Picker helped form a new company, Atlanta-based
CarePointe Research, to survey patients and write reports. In
February, however, Picker says it became clear that CarePointe
President Daryl Savell was not delivering the reports he had
promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's continued to fail to meet all his deadlines. And even
though he has continued to assure us that if we just give him a
little more money he'll be there, right now we have no faith,''
says Susan Edgman-Levitan, Picker's president. ``We decided in
April that we just can't keep doing this and that we had to do
those reports in-house at Picker.''
</P>
<P>
   Savell tells a different story, saying he and his firm have done
the work ``promptly and without delay.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are working on a settlement that would sever ties
even as Picker is trying to fix things with its current clients,
including the Massachusetts hospitals. Early on it took away
responsibility for the Massachusetts survey from Savell and gave it
to another firm. But there ended up being discrepancies in how
patients at different hospitals were handled. Some were asked about
their care two months after discharge while others were asked
several months later, opening the possibility that results might
vary because of failed memory rather than differences in care. The
length and season of the surveys also differed, which could further
skew results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we were planning to publicly release this data, all
the sampling had to be pristine so we could assure everyone we were
comparing apples to apples,'' explains Edgman-Levitan, adding that
troubles with the surveys meant that assurance could not be given.
</P>
<P>
   The setback to the Massachusetts survey is of concern across the
country, since the program was a model for California, Maryland,
and other states. Picker has worked with Bay State hospitals since
1996, and there now are 54 facilities participating that serve 90
percent of all adult patients. Each hospital pays about $5,500 for
its survey, with other costs picked up by the Massachusetts Health
Quality Partnership, a coalition of insurers, business and
professional groups.
</P>
<P>
   The first survey results, in 1997, were not made public but the
second set was released in 1998, and showed Massachusetts hospitals
outperforming their counterparts nationwide on everything from
providing emotional support for new mothers to ensuring physical
comfort after surgery. Responses to this third round of questions,
which were mailed to 39,379 patients, were eagerly anticipated as a
way to measure the effectiveness of expensive programs that
hospitals across the Commonwealth launched in 1998 to improve their
sensitivity to patients.
</P>
<P>
   The hospitals have not seen their round-three scores yet, but
they will get them sometime this fall. In their Friday letter the
Massachusetts Hospital Association and the Health Quality
Partnership made clear the findings will not be made public and
will not be not be presented in the form they were in 1998, which
made it easy to compare hospitals. ``Any public communications
about your hospital's performance'' with regard to the new survey
results, the groups added, ``would be misleading and improper.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Melin, chairman of the hospital association and president
of Cooley Dickinson Hospital in Northampton, said he trusts that
all hospitals will honor the request to keep the scores secret. But
he added that he would feel comfortable generally telling the
public where his hospital still needs to improve and how it is
going to do that.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Picker Institute, it is trying to work out how to
honor the millions of dollars in contracts it has with clients, and
how deeply it should stay involved in the survey business. Its
surveys are used across the United States, as well as in Sweden,
Great Britain, Germany, France, and Switzerland, so it is reluctant
to shed the business. But institute officials learned from the last
year's headaches how difficult coordinating all aspects of
questionnaires can be _ and their sponsors, including CareGroup,
which has its own financial worries at Beth Israel Deaconess and
other hospitals, have learned how costly survey troubles can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said to CareGroup and the Commonwealth Fund, `You've made
a tremendous contribution to the institute and it's unfair to keep
making you pour money in,''' says Harvey Picker, chairman of the
institute's board. ``We've got to go back to trying to make sure
that survey instruments are good and that they are done properly,
but let others do the surveying. . . . We ought to go ahead as the
organization advancing knowledge in the field and move out of the
survey business.''

SO MUCH FOR THE CIVILITY BOYZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pair that vowed piously to bring civility back into national
politics took a Labor Day header into a dry swimming pool. When the
governor of Texas uttered a vulgar insult to his running mate
Monday from an Illinois stage, his words were broadcast to the
crowd and the network microphones.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Adam Clymer, major-league asshole from The New York
Times,'' Bush said as he crinkled his crinkly grin and waved at the
rubes. Responding with the sort of bootlicking acquiescence that
those who knew Dick Cheney's solid record had hoped he would never
stoop to, the vice presidential nominee on the honor and integrity
ticket burped back, ``Oh yeah, he is, big time.''
</P>
<P>
   With Bush's juvenile jibe and Cheney's tail-wagging rejoinder,
the two Republicans undid all their careful propagandizing of the
last two months. This is what rookies do. They get tight around the
collar when the pressure mounts. From his 17-point polling lead a
month ago, when it seemed he could do no wrong, Bush has watched
his lead disappear. Now his campaign traces the classic parabola of
the front-runner who's fallen behind. First there is the
abandonment of the high-road campaign style and the introduction of
the first really negative TV ad barrage. Then there is the silly
refusal to consent to the prearranged debates, three of them worked
out months ago by the two major political parties. Next came the
gaffe in Naperville, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, his apologists scrambled to explain, was upset because
Clymer's articles about his actual record in Texas were
unflattering. The Lone Star State has dirty air, lax regulators,
and does a lousy job of giving poor kids health care. It's all sad
but true. Cheney, meanwhile, has been forced to renounce millions
of dollars in stock options because the Times delved into his $40
million golden handshake from an oil supply company.
</P>
<P>
   So both men have felt the lash of the mighty Times. That's
nothing new. Everyone who runs for president has some journalists
they despise. But Clymer, who is a friend of mine, is not a
fang-and-claw dirt-disher; he is an even-handed reporter of just
the facts, ma'am.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest that the Guv buy a copy of Clymer's recent biography
of Ted Kennedy, the finest explication of the workings of the US
Senate to appear in many a moon. Because, Governor, I don't quite
know how to put this, but you don't know squat about how the
government really works.
</P>
<P>
   You could learn something from Clymer. He's been around
Washington a lot longer than you, when your office in your daddy's
1988 election campaign was across the hall from Dirty Trickster Lee
Atwater's. All you know about national politics you soaked up at
the knee of Low Blow Lee. Willie Horton? The spurious claims that
Mike Dukakis was not a loyal and patriotic American? The racist ads
in the South and West that put your old man up? The apple doesn't
fall far from the tree.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unususal for political clans like Bush, Bush, &AMP; Bush
to leverage its assets (former president, present governors of
Texas and Florida, and maybe the next president) by practicing
us-versus-them politics. If you weren't with George the Father,
you're not fully trusted by George the Son. The phenomenally
successful financial grab that obliterated all of Bush Jr.'s
primary opponents amassed the astonishing total of $100 million for
an untested national candidate. Get on board, or else, boys.
</P>
<P>
   In large part, that money came from corporate executives and
lobbyists already familiar with the access portals to Bush &AMP; Bush
Inc. If you didn't give early, it didn't count nearly as much when
it comes time to dole out the tax breaks, the regulatory relief,
the ambassadorships, the pork, the gravy, and the apple pie a la
mode.
</P>
<P>
   When John McCain was whipping Bush to a fare-thee-well, the
Arizona senator was clobbered by Bush negative ads, beginning in
the South Carolina ambush that leaves McCain's partisans still
smouldering at Bush's cheap tactics. Then there was the $2.5
million in spurious negative ads that a Bush oilman ally dropped on
McCain in New York and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   When push comes to shove, Bush Junior gets down and dirty. Just
like his daddy. Just like Lee Atwater. Willie Horton, your memory
lives on. We're in the stretch run now. Junior looks like he's
getting tight around the collar. His tax cut giveaway isn't working
the way it worked for Old Read-My-Lips. Those bottom-line
lobbyist-contributors see their $100 million going down the drain.
Junior looks like he's afraid of big-time TV debates and wants to
cower in the lee of nice-guy talk show hosts instead.
</P>
<P>
   And now he's told reporters just what he thinks of one of their
best. It is a performance we cannot label major league. I guess
you'd have to call it Bush league.

&HT;     UNIONS COULD LEARN SOME LESSONS FROM THE NRA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I realize how warped this might sound, but bear
with me: Labor unions can learn a lot from watching the National
Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   This is about political strategy, not ideology. The NRA and
organized labor might well be at opposite ends of the ideological
spectrum, but that doesn't mean they can't learn from each other _
just as good workers can learn a lot from watching their rivals.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, both groups have a lot in common. Their basic message
is one of safety and security. The NRA wants people to feel secure
in their homes; labor wants workers to feel secure in their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the groups can go to extremes, whether it's the NRA
protecting assault weapons or a union protecting an incompetent
worker. Sometimes that makes them convenient scapegoats.
</P>
<P>
   People blame the NRA when there is a gun-related tragedy, saying
that gun control would have prevented it. Maybe, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   People blame unions when a company crumbles, saying that the
unions tied the company's hands. Maybe, maybe not. Poorly managed
companies tend to go out of business, even if they are nonunion.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of both groups also might describe their members in
stereotypes, like heavily armed rednecks or slow-moving, apathetic
workers. But the groups wouldn't be nearly as successful as they
are if they couldn't attract large numbers of moderate, rational
people.
</P>
<P>
   What the NRA has done more effectively than unions have, though,
is to take a compelling, emotional issue and mobilize voters behind
it. That has gotten the attention of politicians and made many of
them less likely to stand up to the association.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people feel safer knowing they have a handgun at home.
A lot of other people feel safer knowing they don't. But some of
them would be perfectly willing to run out and buy a gun if they
felt threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Fear is one of the strongest emotions, even if sometimes it
borders on paranoia. The NRA capitalizes on people's fears _ not
only the fear of being attacked in their homes, but the fear of
losing what many consider is the right to protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
   If the NRA goes after a particular politician, that fear can be
a strong motivation for its members to vote the way the association
says. It can carry more weight than the politician's stands on all
the other issues put together.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, those who favor gun control can't draw on the
same strong emotions, other than from the relatively few people who
had a personal tragedy and blame the lack of gun control for it.
Most other supporters see it as a campaign issue, not the campaign
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a democracy, sometimes the minority rules.
</P>
<P>
   Unions have passionate supporters, too, but most of them are
already union members, and membership has been declining for
decades. Union members make up less than one-seventh of the U.S.
work force today, compared with about one-third during organized
labor's peak in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with many unions is their main focus is protecting
jobs _ even in dying industries. That means membership eventually
dwindles because little recruiting can be done, and the union is
often seen as an obstacle to the company's success because it is
busy clinging to the status quo rather than focusing on the future.
</P>
<P>
   As the economy changes and the country progresses, unions have
lost much of what used to give them emotional appeal. Most of the
sweatshops these days are in the high-tech industry, and workers
there make so much money they can afford to hire someone to sweat
for them.
</P>
<P>
   Because society has changed, unions aren't making the kind of
negotiating breakthroughs that they used to, such as getting a
shorter workweek or markedly better benefits. When unions were more
widespread and made negotiating breakthroughs, often their benefits
trickled down to nonunion workers, helping to make labor at least
somewhat popular even with those who weren't in a union.
</P>
<P>
   Because society has changed, unions don't have the emotional and
political rallying cry that they used to. The main issue labor
seems to push for is raising the minimum wage, which is a nice
little issue, but hardly the kind that stirs middle-class emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry to say it, but the future looks bleak for labor unless it
can make that emotional connection. It's never going to find an
issue with the emotional baggage of gun control, but it needs to
search for something of substance.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know that there is an answer, but the biggest emotional
hot spot for workers these days seems to be the continuing layoffs
and the cavalier attitude some companies have about throwing people
out on the street. On top of that are unemployment benefits that
are so small as to be relatively useless to middle-class workers.
</P>
<P>
   If labor could position itself as the hero in this struggle,
using political pressure to get better treatment for all laid-off
workers, it might be able to turn things around. Even if you have
never been laid off, the fear of losing your job can be a powerful
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   As the NRA knows, people's fears can make up a powerful
political weapon.

MIGHTY FOOTBALL HAS STRUCK OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  SAN JOSE, Calif. _ The National Football League has begun its
season on corporate logo turf with bizarrely dorky names. But from
Milquetoast Stadium to Fughedaboutit Field, dot.com sponsorship
can't conceal the bad news for the NFL: boring teams and bored
fans.
</P>
<P>
   If Ernest Lawrence Thayer wrote a football version of ``Casey at
the Bat,'' he might begin: ``It looked extremely geeky for the
Nerdville nine that day.'' Baseball, for all its ills, is much as
it was when Thayer wrote ``Casey'' in 1888. Football changes often,
not for the better.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A pallor wreathed the features of the patrons of the game.
</P>
<P>
   A straggling few got up to go, leaving there the rest,
</P>
<P>
   With that hope which springs eternal within the human breast.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One NFL hope may be that fans forget January's Super Bowl. No
problem. Only diehards remember the teams. Only those who bet
heavily recall the score. The NFL faces a rival next year, the XFL,
with smaller-market teams sporting fiercer names and gorier
graphics. The Orlando Rage franchise proclaims: ``Sensory overload
is the theme.'' The Birmingham Thunderbolts, the Las Vegas Outlaws,
and the Memphis Maniax seek fans with sensory underload. As fewer
Americans engage in physical work, the need for vicarious excitment
escalates.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then from the gladdened multitude went up a joyous yell-
</P>
<P>
   It rumbled in the mountaintops, it rattled in the dell;
</P>
<P>
   It struck upon the hillside and rebounded on the flat.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here in Silicon Valley, computer programmers and cyberwranglers
will see the San Jose Demons. As XFL marketers ask, ``What name or
symbol could be more menacing?'' The Demon major domo is named
Michael Preacher, no hellish handle. Introduced as the team's
general manager, Preacher said: ``This isn't a sissy man's game.''
Fans must take his word for it. He was a punter, a nonferocious
position, for the University of Oregon. Preacher's progress follows
the XFL's preferred formula: from a Duck to a Demon.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt,
</P>
<P>
   Five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt;
</P>
<P>
   Then when the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,
</P>
<P>
   Defiance glanced in Casey's eye, a sneer curled Casey's lip.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York spoke at a
Conference of Sociological Visions at Yale University. His theme
was ``Defining Deviancy Down.'' Moynihan was prescient, as XFL
marketing proves in statements ranging from oxymoronic to moronic.
``The XFL is going to be serious football,'' says one. Another
declares: ``The XFL will be a league that allows men and women to
live out their dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   XFL propaganda evokes professional wrestling because the XFL is
wrestling's corporate spinoff. But it is also a logical destination
on the NFL's downward path from a team sport to a circus of
individual showoffs. Here, I feel sadly prophetic; in 1999, noting
the NFL's decline from a time when athletic skill and dignity were
teammates, I wrote what could be the XFL's prospectus: ``Pro
football increasingly resembles pro wrestling: trash talk
punctuated by silly dances.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone at XFL marketing agreed. Another statement guarantees
fake misbehavior: ``The XFL is never going to bottle up the natural
personalities of its players, coaches, or other personnel. Instead,
the XFL is going to showcase each person's enthusiasm and
charisma.''
</P>
<P>
   Herewith a prediction on women's pro basketball. Some
entrepreneur of lewd deviance will start the Bikini Basketball
League. Will it succeed? I hope not, but I'm a sentimentalist. I'm
from Mudville. I root for Casey.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright,
</P>
<P>
   The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light;
</P>
<P>
   And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout,
</P>
<P>
   But there is no joy in Mudville_mighty Casey has struck out.

   Will ``The Sopranos'' get its due? Or will ``West Wing''
exercise a presidential veto?
</P>
<P>
   That's the big question hanging over the 52nd annual Emmy
Awards, hosted by Garry Shandling and airing on ABC Sunday at 8.
</P>

   The two acclaimed dramas tied with the most nominations _ 18
each _ must be considered the favorites in most of their respective
categories. Emmy voters' longtime preference for the tried and true
_ along with the fact that it's an election year _ suggests NBC's
traditional ``West Wing'' has the edge. But a new system that
allows Academy members to vote at home, rather than attend marathon
screenings, may bring in a wider field of voters and give HBO's
raw, brilliant Mafia drama ``Sopranos'' the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing it seems safe to count on is that the Oval Office
and the mob will be featured in Shandling's comedy bits.
</P>
<P>
   The other best-drama competitors are ``Law &AMP; Order,'' ``The
Practice'' and ``ER,'' all of which have won before and can't
compare to the two front-runners.
</P>
<P>
   For best comedy, the nominees are ``Everybody Loves Raymond,''
``Frasier,'' ``Friends,'' ``Sex and the City'' and ``Will &AMP;
Grace.'' ``Will'' is NBC's newly anointed 8 p.m. Thursday comedy
and could be a surprise winner here, but buzz for the hilarious if
traditional ``Raymond'' has been building. Smart money is not
betting this category.
</P>
<P>
   Emmy viewers will want to tune in to ABC at 7 for an hourlong
pre-show featuring red-carpet arrivals. The truly dedicated (or
demented) will start at noon with a six-hour Emmy preview on
cable's E!, followed by Joan and Melissa Rivers' catty two-hour
red-carpet show at 6.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HIGHLIGHTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother,'' CBS Saturday at 8: We're rooting for a comet,
or at least a big earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   College football, ABC Saturday at 8: Florida State at Georgia
Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleepless in Seattle,'' CBS Saturday at 9: The terminally
adorable Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks star in this 1993 story of
long-distance romance. To guys, though, it sorta feels like one
long International Coffee moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hispanic Heritage Awards,'' NBC Saturday at 10: Raquel Welch
and Bobby Cannavale co-host the 14th annual salute to
Hispanic-Americans with high achievement in the arts, sports and
society. Sammy Sosa and Martin Sheen are among those scheduled to
appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturday Night Live,'' NBC Saturday at 11:30: The series is
often criticized for being too white, but tonight's show focuses on
cast member Tim Meadows. (Hint: He's the black one.)
</P>
<P>
   ''60 Minutes,'' CBS Sunday at 7: Tick, tick, tick. TBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speed,'' Fox Sunday at 7:30: For better or worse, Keanu Reeves
became an action star in this 1994 thriller about a SWAT team cop
who must keep a bus going more than 50 miles per hour or a madman's
bomb will explode. Sandra Bullock became a star as the bus driver.
And Dennis Hopper plays ... well, you can guess, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``On Our Own Terms: Moyers on Dying,'' PBS Sunday at 9: A
four-part series, airing through Wednesday, in which Bill Moyers
turns his thoughtful lens on the process by which we leave this
world.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FAMILY FARE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OK, there's not much for the little ones this weekend, but you
have a great chance to get your bright 'tweeners and early teens
hooked on cinema (as opposed to the junk they get too often at the
multiplex today). Two cable networks are airing behind-the-scenes
shows about great movies, followed by the movies themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Backstory,'' on American Movie Classics Saturday at 5:30,
takes on the Bette Davis classic ``All About Eve.'' The bumpy night
continues at 6 with the movie itself. ``Destination Hitchcock: The
Making of North By Northwest'' airs on Turner Classic Movies Sunday
at 8:30. The documentary is followed at 9:30 by the classic 1959
film itself, with Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint, plus those great
scenes in the cornfield and on Mount Rushmore.
</P>
<P>
   There may be a few minor content issues to discuss with the
kids, but pretty mild stuff compared to say, the latest Adam
Sandler movie. And maybe these shows will help them understand the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CABLE CAST &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Blade Runner,'' Sci Fi Saturday at 9:30: The uncut,
letterboxed director's cut of Ridley Scott's 1982 science fiction
classic. Harrison Ford stars as the private eye tracking down
rebellious androids in a dystopian future.
</P>
<P>
   NFL Football, ESPN Sunday at 8:30: Cowboys at Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confessions,'' Court TV Sunday at 10: It's becoming hard to
stir the public's outrage about reality TV, but this show has done
it. The cable network will be broadcasting real killers' taped
confessions, allegedly with the really gory stuff edited out.
Still, the show looks chilling. And all of Court TV's high-minded
rationales can't wipe away the creepy, exploitative nature of going
for ratings in this fashion. Let's all do ourselves a favor and
tune out. &QL;

chairs. A weathered tombstone adorned with plastic roses. Not
anymore. These days, plastics are commanding a level of respect _
and often high prices _ that's earning them a spot in even homes on
the right side of the track. ``Better plastics are available today,
and people are finally realizing you can mix them with pieces from
the entire 20th century,'' said Scott Reilly of retromodern.com, at
Atlanta retailer that specializes in plastic furnishings and
accessories.(Flanders, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) WITH PHOTOS

   WRESTLING-KILLER _ For the Extreme Championship Wrestling TV
Title Match in March, Rob Van Dam, leg in a cast, rode on the
shoulders of another wrestler out of the smoke-filled tunnel and
past cheering fans pressed up against the metal barricades. For the
occasion, which included slamming a wrestler named Rhino into a
table, Van Dam wore the Arena Football jersey of his late friend,
Bobby Duncum Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Just a couple of months prior to the March show, Van Dam was in
Allentown, Pa., signing autographs at a memorial show for another
late wrestling buddy, Gary Albright. Van Dam has lost three close
friends in the wrestling business, Louis ``Spicolli'' Mucciolo Jr.
two years ago and Albright and Duncum since January. Albright, at
36, was the oldest. Duncum was 34 and Mucciolo, 27. ``With Louie, I
hadn't been there before,'' Van Dam said. ``The more it happens,
the less shocked I am.'' (Maher, Austin American-Statesman) WITH

   FBO-MILEHIGH _ Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler has described
Denver's Mile High Stadium as the ``toughest place to play in the
NFL.'' Coach Dan Reeves has called it the ``greatest outdoor
stadium'' in the league. What makes Mile High so unique? Most of it
centers around the 80,000 fans that pack the facility each game and
the noise that they generate, making it difficult for opposing
players to hear themselves on the field. The Falcons have attempted
to simulate the noise level during practice this week, but Chandler
admits it's nearly impossible to match the noise level at Mile
High. (Winkeljohn, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   UNDATED _ In August and September, it's easy to miss the glory
of cactus fruit. Certainly, it's more comfortable to keep to the
air-conditioning in the dire heat. But a field trip, particularly
to the homes of wise neighbors who have xeriscaped their property,
would reveal Texas' state plant festooned with ``tunas,'' the red
fruit or ``pears'' that are the yin to the yang of the paddles of
the prickly pear cactus. This survivor may well be one of the

   LOS ANGELES _ Even without my trusty Rand McNally, it's not hard
to recognize that I'm in California. Road signs on Highway 1 direct
me to vineyards. The passenger window is open so I can hear the
ocean hitting the rocks. And when I reach Santa Barbara, the
gas-station cashier is stationed in front of a towering carved
coffee bar. She can't locate the restroom key for me, but she can
put a mean head on a cappuccino. The Pacific hem of California is
far different from the fabric that makes up the rest of the state.

&HT;     COASTAL TOWN IN OREGON BECOMES PLAYGROUND FOR CALIFORNIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RICHARD PAOLI  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORENCE, Ore. _ While summer weather along the Oregon coast can
offer bright blue skies and fogless mornings, the coastal winter
can be gray, wet and windy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best weather is about five months during the summer,''
said Andy Johnson, a real estate broker in the seaside town of
Florence. ``It's just that people planning to move here, or retire
here, should know about the colder, wetter and windier days.''
</P>
<P>
   Why move to a place where the weather gets raw in winter?
</P>
<P>
   Housing prices would be one reason. Johnson's firm, Coastal Real
Estate Inc., affiliated with Coldwell Banker, does about 40 percent
of its business with Californians moving up the coast to Oregon.
``An entry-level new home here costs $150,000. Figure the costs at
about $100 a square foot,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   For $200,000 ``you'll get a lot more house,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a ``laid-back market,'' Johnson said. ``We have houses
that stay on the market for six to seven months.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a sharp contrast to many markets in the San Francisco
Bay Area and the Silicon Valley in Northern California, where
housing costs are among the highest in the nation and properties
move at a frenetic pace.
</P>
<P>
   For Florence Mayor Alan Burns, while welcoming new home buyers
to this town of 7,000, says the future population make-up is a
concern. ``We want to try and a maintain a balance of retired and
working families,'' he said. ``We need the younger folks to provide
the services that make this an attractive place to retire to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is a small, rural town,'' the mayor added, ``not a
big city. And we have to preserve that character.''
</P>
<P>
   North of Florence, just past the city limits, are a number of
communities developers have designed for the California buyer.
</P>
<P>
   The homes are built in clearings among the wax myrtle, shore
pines and native rhododendrons behind the dune-edged beaches. The
developments, with names like Mariner's Village and Shelter Cove,
are often gated. ``I think that's something the builders picked up
on from the California buyers,'' Johnson said. ``It was a matter of
security because some of the homes aren't occupied all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Florence was once an active timber port and harbor for a fishing
fleet. The lumber industry casts a mere shadow now and most of the
fishing fleet has sailed away.
</P>
<P>
   But visitors to the beaches and summer vacationers have pumped
new life into many Oregon coastal towns such as Florence. And,
while that takes care of the summer, the growing number of retired
residents has given the towns a winter boost.

INSIDE RAP: DOCUMENTARY RIFE WITH RHYME, BUT NO REASON
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ROBERT PHILPOT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1999, mega-hot rapper Jay-Z rounded up a bunch of friends,
rivals and label-mates and put together a hugely popular 54-city
extravaganza called the Hard Knock Life tour. Rock fans didn't have
to be intimate with rap to know many of the names _ Method Man,
Redman and gazillion-selling DMX among them _ on the
Lollapalooza-esque bill. The rappers had enough cultural impact to
make the tour an arena-filling success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Backstage,'' Chris Fiore's documentary about the tour, comes
advertised with the tag line: ``Behind the applause. Behind the
lyrics. There is the truth.'' Not so fast, bucko. Questionable
punctuation aside, the tag line advertises more than it delivers.
``Backstage'' is relentless, and the performances often ferocious,
but despite all the access the rappers granted Fiore, the movie is
too much surface, not enough depth.
</P>
<P>
   Fiore, who has done several shorter documentaries, is an
acclaimed editor. He knows how to drive the movie along, with help
from a pulsating score that's interrupted only by concert scenes.
At times, you might wish he'd slow down a little; he rarely lets a
performance linger all the way through. But then, the movie is
called ``Backstage,'' and Fiore and his crew hang out with the
rappers as they bicker, scam on groupies, throw dice, smoke blunts,
and, well, generally indulge in the sort of offstage bacchanalias
that pop stars are known for.
</P>
<P>
   The best moments in ``Backstage'' come when the rappers start
getting in the filmmakers' faces, but even the most threatening of
those moments seems more like bluster than brutality. Fiore's
juxtapositions reveal an ironic sense of humor; he cuts from a
rapper's tantrum to a goofy guided tour of the posse's bus, and
from talk about how the rappers formed a ``family'' to scenes of
bloodied noses.
</P>
<P>
   The most pointed comment comes from turntable-master Raymond
``DJ Twinz Z'' Grant, who notes that mosh-pit violence at rock
concerts never attracts the attention that violence at rap concerts
does, and the movie emphasizes the lack of violence during the tour
and includes a concert scene in which a troubled Jay-Z decides to
donate half the tour proceeds to victims of the Columbine High
School shootings. After the violence at the recent ``Source''
Hip-Hop Awards, it's refreshing to see a rapper show that much
heart.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie doesn't dig deeply enough into the frequent
dichotomy of rap _ Jay-Z might talk peace, but the music too often
celebrates violence _ and doesn't provide any revealing glimpses
into anyone's personas. For that, maybe you're better of
subscribing to ``Source.'' Maybe there you'll learn the rationales
for the frequent misogyny and tiresome boasting that detracts from
the vibrant beats and imaginative, sometimes stunning, rhymes.
``Backstage'' stops just short of being a shill, but it's still a
case of rapping to the choir.

 &HT;    Get out of the red-sauce rut and let pasta's good taste shine
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I was growing up, pasta was spaghetti, and it came from
Chef Boyardee. Not the kind in the can, mind you, but the kit in
the box.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother prepared most of my meals, and she was quite
smitten with convenience foods from a box. So I believed that pasta
was squishy noodles under a thick blanket of pasty tomato sauce
with a dusting of processed Parmesan cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I know better now. I've learned my fusilli from my
orecchiette, and, with an endless harvest of basil from my back
yard this summer, pesto has knocked tomato sauce off its throne.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, I've been working through some marvelously simple
recipes in Susan Herrmann Loomis' new ``Italian Farmhouse
Cookbook'' (Workman, $16.95) that have elevated my view of pasta
even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Italy, pasta is not about a bunch of sauce over something
starchy,'' Loomis explained at a recent demonstration at Cook's
Warehouse in Midtown. ``Italians really love the pasta, so they
don't hide it.''
</P>
<P>
   For ``sauce,'' Italian farmhouse cooks are more likely to step
outside the door and gather some fresh parsley, chop it and toss it
with olive oil, pine nuts and lemon zest. Nuts, herbs, cheeses,
tomatoes, sardines _ the combinations are endless and usually are
driven by what's on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Pasta may be fresh, but just as often dried. Either way, it
won't be crammed into a pot that's too small, and then boiled to
death. Loomis walked the class through the basic techniques of
careful pasta preparation. Some of the tips I'd already practiced,
but for the last month I've followed these to the letter, with
great results.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use a very large pot, either a big pasta cooker with fitted
colander or a large soup pot.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cook pasta in an abundant quantity of water, which means more
than you ever imagined. Six quarts of water for 1 pound of pasta.
(Cook's Illustrated says, contrary to common belief, that you can
start with hot water.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Add a good quantity of salt to the water to avoid bland pasta.
If using regular table salt, use one full tablespoon of salt for 6
quarts (twice that much if using kosher or sea salt).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make sure the water is boiling vigorously before adding pasta,
which you should do slowly, and then stir once so it cooks evenly.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Time carefully. Fresh pasta is usually cooked in 1 1/2
minutes. Dried pasta, depending on the shape and brand, takes 7 to
8 minutes for al dente, which is tender but still firm to the bite.
If adding to a hot sauce, reduce time by about 1 minute.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Drain the pasta in a colander set in the sink, or remove the
pasta quickly with a hand-held strainer or tongs. The advantage to
the latter is that you can use a bit of the pasta water with the
sauce _ a secret of many a good Italian farmhouse cook.
</P>
<P>
   If you've been in a spaghetti-and-tomato-sauce rut or are
skeptical that these steps are necessary, why not try out this dish
that's been making a weekly appearance on my table. It's one of the
easiest things in the world to make. And one of the best.
</P>
<P>
   Giusto's Pasta with Mint Sauce
</P>
<P>
   Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat.
Mince 1 cup of gently packed fresh mint and transfer to a large
bowl. Drizzle with about 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil. Stir in 2
minced cloves of garlic and 1/3 cup raisins, then season with salt
(and hot paprika if desired).
</P>
<P>
   Cube 1 pound of eggplant. Add the eggplant and 1 pound of a
short dried pasta, such fusilli or penne, to the boiling water at
the same time, stir once and cook about 8 minutes. Drain, saving
1/2 cup of the pasta water.
</P>
<P>
   Add the pasta, eggplant and 1/2 cup water to the mint sauce and
toss thoroughly to coat. Serve with grated cheese. Makes about 4
servings.

 &HT;    Cupcakes attract all kinds of folks
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What more proof does one need that good things come in small
packages than a cupcake?
</P>
<P>
   Kids love them. Adults love them. And cooks love them because
they are easy and versatile. A muffin/cupcake pan is ideal, but if
you don't have one, foil baking cups hold up on their own. Simply
place on a cookie sheet and fill.
</P>
<P>
   Paper liners come in so many patterns and themes, the decorating
can begin with them. And liners mean pans don't have to be greased
and floured or scrubbed. Fill the liners about 2/3 full _ generally
about 1/2 cup batter. I like enough for a nice dome to rise above
the liner.
</P>
<P>
   Recipe tester Margaret Ann Surber offers this tip for quick
filling of the cups: Pour the batter, a bit at a time, into a
pastry bag or a plastic bag with a small tip cut off one corner and
squeeze the batter into the cups.
</P>
<P>
   Cake mixes work fine, and most have cooking times for cupcakes
with the baking instructions. We give you a gussied-up chocolate
cake mix to work with below, along with a vanilla cake from
scratch. Both are excellent, all-around recipes (that work fine for
layer cakes, too). We give you some classic frostings to work with
as well. Our preparation times include about 10 minutes to frost
the cupcakes. Decorating time depends on your own ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   A treat for any occasion
</P>
<P>
   Here are just a few ideas for decorating cupcakes to fit
different occasions. We found many more super suggestions on two
Web sites. The Reynolds folks (who sell foil bake cups) have a nice
selection. Go to www.reynoldskitchens.com and do a search for
``cupcakes.'' Be sure and check out the smiling sunshine cupcake.
</P>
<P>
   Folks at www.family.com recently held a contest to come up with
a cupcake for every letter in the alphabet. Do a search for
``cupcake'' in the search field for the overall site (not in the
recipe finder).
</P>
<P>
   Check out the cake decorating supplies at your favorite grocery,
but if you want to get a little more creative, stop by a party
store, craft store or cake decorating supply store. We had good
luck at Michaels Arts and Crafts (several metro locations), Cook's
Warehouse in Midtown and Cake Art in Stone Mountain and Duluth.

   &QR;  Ice cream cone method (below): Small, flat-bottomed ice cream
cones can substitute for paper liners so both cupcake and holder
can be eaten. Wrap the bottom half of the cones in foil and stand
them up on a cookie sheet. Spoon about 1/2 cup batter into each
cone _ leaving about a 1/4-inch rim. Carefully put the cookie sheet
in the oven and bake at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes. Then
frost and decorate.
</P>
<P>
   You may need to experiment with how far you fill the cup to get
the shape you want. For a real tall dome shape on top (to look like
scoops), bake some additional batter in paper liners, filling the
cups about halfway. Once cooled, invert those on top of the cones,
frost and decorate. These are best eaten the day they are prepared,
as the cones get soggy.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Boo-tiful Cupcakes (above): Bake and frost cupcakes. (A little
orange food coloring blended into a cream cheese frosting is nice.)
Then, in a medium-size, heavy saucepan, combine 1 cup white
chocolate morsels with 2 teaspoons vegetable shortening (not butter
or margarine). Stir gently until melted.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon or brush the mixture into ghost shapes on a cookie sheet
lined with wax paper. Use chocolate sprinkles for eyes. Refrigerate
until firm, about 30 minutes, and then stand 1 ghost in the center
of each cupcake.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tailgating: Frost cupcakes with fall colors such as yellow,
orange and brown (chocolate) and sprinkle with similar-colored
sugars or sprinkles. Then insert decorator picks like footballs
into the centers. Or frost and sprinkle with school colors.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Elections: You guessed it _ red, white and blue works here. We
looked for donkeys and elephants, but no luck. But it wasn't too
hard to find sprinkles, flags, cupcake liners and other decorations
in patriotic colors.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Olympics: If you're thinking of hosting some Olympics viewing
parties, pick up a package of international flag picks to stick in
cupcakes. Or create your own little Olympic competition and give
folks some decorating gels and see who can create recognizable
flags.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Coffee break: Check out the chocolate cappuccino cupcake and
mocha cream cheese frosting recipes at left. Then top with
chocolate-covered espresso beans. Brew up a pot and invite your
best friends over for a chat and a buzz.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Weddings/showers: I have a friend who had a very small
centerpiece cake made for her wedding, and then loaded up the table
with cupcakes. For a shower, why not put a mini bride and groom on
a cupcake and place it in the center of the serving tray, then
surround it with cupcakes decorated with flowers?

   Cupcake Cafe is an adorable bakery in New York that tempts
passers-by with window displays of scrumptious cakes and treats.
This cake has a delicate crumb, and it melts in your mouth _ a
great all-purpose cupcake.
</P>
<P>
   24 baking cup liners
</P>
<P>
   9 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound (3 sticks) butter
</P>
<P>
   3 cups granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   3 cups cake flour
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups buttermilk
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line muffin pans with paper or foil
liners.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully separate the eggs, making sure not to get any yolk in
the whites. Put the whites aside at room temperature to be beaten
later.
</P>
<P>
   In a larger mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar together
with an electric mixer. Beat in the egg yolks and add the vanilla,
then set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Sift together the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda and
salt and set aside. In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg whites
until they are fluffy (they should just hold their shape) but not
dry.
</P>
<P>
   Mix the dry ingredients alternately with the buttermilk into the
creamed egg-and-butter mixture. Once those ingredients are blended
(do not overbeat) gently fold in the beaten egg whites.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon batter into the cupcake liners, filling about 2/3 of each
cup. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until a straw or cake tester
inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean. Allow to
cool completely, then frost. _ From ``The Cupcake Cafe Cookbook''

   Familiar and yummy, this buttercream is a standard. Mix in a few
drops of food color when you want hues to match cupcake themes.
This recipe comes from ``The Magnolia Bakery Cookbook'' by Jennifer
Appel and Allysa Torey (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25) _ a wonderful place
for a cupcake pick-me-up in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, very soft
</P>
<P>
   4 cups confectioners' sugar, divided
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract

<P>
   Place butter in a large mixing bowl. Add 2 cups confectioners'
sugar, the milk and vanilla extract. Beat with an electric mixer
until smooth and creamy. Gradually add remaining sugar, 1 cup at a
time, until thick enough to be of good spreading consistency (you
may not use all the sugar or you may want to use slightly more). If
desired, add a few drops food coloring and mix thoroughly. Use and
store icing at room temperature, keeping in an airtight container
up to 3 days.

 &HT;    Those diminutive sweet treats `bring out the kid in all of us' _
and they're a snap to make
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember those long, dull afternoons at school? After the
initial two weeks, the new routine has become familiar and reality
begins to sink in _ nine more months of reading, writing and
'rithmetic.
</P>
<P>
   The playground looks sunny; the school gates invite escape. But
there's no way out. Wait a minute. Is that Joey's mom? Hey, didn't
he say today was his birthday? What's she carrying in that box?
</P>
<P>
   It's a cupcake break!
</P>
<P>
   There's no more complete, petite package of pleasure. No knives,
no plates, no forks required. Just peel back the paper and sink
your teeth into sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone likes cupcakes. They bring out the kid in all
of us,'' said Pat Schweitzer, senior home economist in the Reynolds
Kitchens. ``And this time of year, there will be lots of occasions
to send treats to school, and birthday parties really start up
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Cupcakes are ideal for grown-up gatherings, too. ``They've
become more popular for coffee breaks and office parties and
holiday parties, '' Schweitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Baby boomers, after all, were the first to enjoy home-baked
cupcakes on a broad scale. The term ``cupcake'' is believed to be
of British-American origin but originally referred to the
ingredients _ a cup of flour, a cup of sugar _ much as
``poundcake'' first referred to a pound of butter, a pound of eggs,
a pound of flour.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial bakers began using paper baking cups just after World
War I, but they weren't widely marketed to the home consumer until
the 1950s. (The aluminum foil cups were called ``Shape Guards.'')
Since then, cupcakes have been a home-baking standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started serving cupcakes because it's so nostalgic,'' said
Jane Thompson, chef-owner of Mondo Bakery at Howell Mill and Huff
roads. ``I did my version of the classic Hostess cupcake just to
see what people would do. They love them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cupcakes are easy. There's no greasing, flouring or cleanup of
pans. In fact, with foil baking cups, you don't even need a special
cupcake or muffin pan. Simply place them on a cookie sheet and
fill. Most take 20 to 30 minutes to bake and less than 10 minutes
to frost.
</P>
<P>
   Cupcakes invite creativity. A basic vanilla buttercream can be
transformed with food coloring. Or simply sprinkle the tops with
colored sugars, candy bits or sprinkles, readily available in many
seasonal varieties in grocery stores. We spotted red, white and
blue sprinkles around the Fourth of July; now orange, red and brown
leaves are available for fall.
</P>
<P>
   At Cook's Warehouse, we found a multishaker of colored sugars in
orange, purple and green hues. At Cake Art in Stone Mountain, Ga.,
we uncovered oodles of cupcake-sized decorations: footballs for
tailgating, flags for Olympic or election parties, and even a
miniature bride and groom for showers or weddings. And Cake Art and
Michaels craft stores offer cupcake papers with Halloween, fall,
sports and patriotic themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be afraid to enlist the kids for help,'' advised
Schweitzer. Set up an assembly line or simply frost the cupcakes,
set out a number of decorations and let kids (young and old)
decorate their own.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, we offer recipes for classic vanilla, sour cream
chocolate, spicy gingerbread and tart lemon cupcakes. For
frostings, we walk you through vanilla and chocolate buttercream
and a versatile cream cheese variety. And we offer decorating tips
for cupcakes for every occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, for the kid in us, cupcakes can be the occasion any
day.

 &HT;    Smart, nutritious snacking for kids? Yes, it's possible
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Technology, fast food, suburbia and busy working families have
taken a toll on America's kids. It's been in the news of late, but
to many parents it's no news flash that too many kids are
overweight, don't get enough exercise and have notoriously bad
eating habits.
</P>
<P>
   With both parents working, keeping up with what kids eat all day
is almost impossible. But even if they've spent more time at
McDonald's than at the kitchen table, it's never too late to
upgrade your child's nutritional profile. So quit the nagging and
visit some of these excellent sites for ideas and tips.
</P>
<P>
   SNACKING
</P>
<P>
   Since studies have shown that snacking is a big culprit in the
area of poor nutrition and that most kids snack when parents are
not around, this is a good place to start advancing toward good
nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A couple of minutes at this site will arm you with confidence
that indeed something can be done. Here are tips from the American
Dietetic Association, Center for Science in the Public Interest and
the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Center for Nutrition Policy and
Promotion. See www.healthatoz.com/atoz/fitness
</P>
<P>
   /nutritioncenter/Kidsnack.asp.
</P>
<P>
   Snacks should be kid friendly. Cut fruits and vegetables into
easily manageable, bite-size portions.
</P>
<P>
   Kids enjoy and eat more fruits and vegetables when they're
accompanied by yogurt dips and low-fat salad dressings.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid soft drinks and caffeine, and serve only juices that are
100 percent juice.
</P>
<P>
   Substitute bagels, rice cakes or tortillas for cookies,
doughnuts and other sweet baked goods. Let children add a bit of
peanut butter, jam or low-fat cream cheese to their selections.
</P>
<P>
   Limit salty, high-fat snacks. Instead, offer baked pretzels,
air-popped popcorn, dry cereal, granola or low-fat cheese and

needs, and healthy snacking should become a regular part of a kid's
daily diet. Some guidelines:
</P>
<P>
   Have healthy snacks available in a special area in your
cupboards and refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Serve snacks at set times rather than throughout the day _ and
not too close to meals.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful with foods that may cause choking. Foods such as
popcorn, peanuts, raw vegetables and dried fruits (including
raisins) are not recommended for children younger than 3.
</P>
<P>
   If a child's diet is generally well-balanced, foods high in
sugar or fat may be used as snacks, because they can provide
calories needed for growth.

 &HT;    Readers point out case of fly's mistaken identity
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a recent column about the garden's occupation by beetles and
wasps and moths, oh my, I confessed to knowing nothing about a
huge, intriguing winged insect that flew in on gossamer wings and
parked on my porch in McCaysville, Ga., lending a primeval look to
the view down to Fightingtown Creek. A Fannin County friend saw my
photograph of the creature and immediately identified it as a
stonefly.
</P>
<P>
   Some insect-savvy readers wrote to differ, others sent accounts
of nonfly experiences in the garden during summer's Bug Days:
</P>
<P>
   I very much enjoyed today's article about the insects being in
charge of our world. The bugs around my house are a close second in
command to my beautiful orange and black tabby, Halle. However, the
insect you saw on that front porch was a dobsonfly, not a stonefly.
</P>
<P>
   Dobsonflies are also creek area breeders, just as the stoneflies
are. The adults lay their eggs on objects that overhang water. When
the eggs hatch, the larvae fall into the water where they prey on
anything they can overpower. And, at up to four inches long, that
is a lot!
</P>
<P>
   In the Adopt-a-Stream program, we use these aquatic larval
stages of insects to gauge the health of a stream's habitat and
water quality. Both dobsonfly and stonefly larvae are very
sensitive to pollution, and can only be found in very good quality
water.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Fulton County Adopt-a-Stream coordinator
</P>
<P>
   I enjoy reading your articles in the paper. The picture in the
Thursday, Aug. 17, column is not a stonefly but a dobsonfly. If you
look in an Audubon book on insects and spiders you can see a
picture of the larva and winged stages of the stonefly and the
dobsonfly. I fish with what I call a ``rock worm'' in the Flint
River, which is the larva stage of the dobsonfly.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   I was reading your column this morning and noted that you had a
nice picture of a dobsonfly mislabeled as a stonefly. I'm afraid I
can't tell you a lot about dobsonflies other than the larvae of
both make good bait. According to my insect book, larvae of
dobsonflies are beneficial because they eat black fly larvae, and
stonefly larvae, when absent, are a good indicator of pollution.

<P>
   This afternoon I was watching the butterflies on our verbena. I
saw this little creature and called my husband out. Quick.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like a baby hummer. We were so excited. About two
inches long. Wings and two little antennae. Somewhere in the back
of my mind I remembered reading about a look-alike hummer. I dug
through my Home &AMP; Garden section and found the article you wrote
describing the hummingbird moth (winged, pointy-beaked).
</P>
<P>
   I sure was glad I had the Aug. 17 issue on hand. What fun. I
know nothing else about the hummingbird moth. It is such a tiny
little creature. Thanks!

</P>
<P>
   And thanks to my correspondents who espy bugs in newspapers and
read books on insects. Inspired, I went out and bought the National
Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Insects &AMP; Spiders
that Tommy Huckaby mentioned. What a bug feast. This book contains
words and pictures about critters I never dreamed of. And wouldn't
want to.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, both the stonefly and the dobsonfly are pictured and
depicted. The book, quite a learning experience, certainly makes it
look as if my porch fly was a dobsonfly.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that a dobsonfly to many is a stonefly to some? A
fly by any name has never been so intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   LEE MAY / Staff
</P>
<P>
   Hey, that's a dobsonfly! That's what readers said about this
insect, which was identified as a stonefly in a previous column.

 &HT;    Plastic makes perfect: Consumers snap up product designs, both
vintage and new
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember when mere mention of the word plastic evoked images of
cheap stuff? A formal dinner served with _ gasp! _ plastic knives
and forks. An English garden strewn with plastic lawn chairs. A
weathered tombstone adorned with plastic roses.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   These days, plastics are commanding a high level of respect _
and often high prices _ that's earning them a spot in homes on the
right side of the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better plastics are available today, and people are finally
realizing you can mix them with pieces from the entire 20th
century,'' said Scott Reilly of retromodern.com, an Atlanta
retailer that specializes in plastic furnishings and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   As consumers look back on the highlights of the past century,
many are drawn to the clean, simple lines of modern design. That
appeal, in turn, opens their minds to products created in the 1940s
through the 1960s by some of the world's most respected designers,
who recognized the potential of plastic.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many classic plastic furnishings net top dollar from
collectors of vintage design. But at the same time, advances in
manufacturing technology have made new products _ even knockoffs of
vintage pieces _ affordable by the masses. Mainstream retailers are
selling everything from plastic housewares to plastic CD storage
cabinets faster than you can burp your Tupperware.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are getting more conscious of plastic through places
like Target,'' Reilly said. ``When the economy is good, it says to
me they're interested in the way objects look. They'll pay more for
aesthetics, way beyond just function.''
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing innovations _ high-tech resins, polymers and
polypropylenes _ are allowing designers to create products that are
strong but lightweight, flexible and versatile enough for indoors
or out.
</P>
<P>
   The same material used to make crash helmets can be found in
many furnishings. ``You can throw these pieces on a cement floor,
and they won't crack,'' Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago, consumers were mesmerized by not only the funky
shapes and forms such an inexpensive material could produce but
also its radiant, translucent rainbow of colors.
</P>
<P>
   Today's plastics offer that same hook, but there's a greater
emphasis on pastels _ baby blue, citrus green, sage and tangerine _
and matte rather than shiny finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture and product designers are also mixing plastic with
materials such as glass, metal and even wood. That helps consumers
who might feel skittish about plastic to blend these pieces with
more traditional ones.
</P>
<P>
   One attraction when plastic first came on the scene was its
functionality. Nowadays, who could imagine the vast array of
storage products sold by retailers such as the Container Store if
it weren't for plastic?
</P>
<P>
   Still, a half-century ago, part of the material's lure was the
obscure products that were made from it. At retromodern.com, you
can gaze at one of European houseware giant Alessi's kitschy
objects for a long time before realizing it's a butter dish, a soap
dispenser or a cigarette lighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who buy plastics just as objects to make you
laugh,'' said Bryan Albrecht of Domus, an Atlanta contemporary
furnishings store.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkled among the sleek chrome, wood and glass modern pieces
in his showroom are Philippe Starck's classic bright red, orange
and green stackable Bu Bu stools. On a back shelf is a candy shop
of plastic chairs, many of them reproductions of vintage furniture.
</P>
<P>
   One, Danish designer Verner Panton's famed Panton chair, which
stunned the world in 1960 as a one-piece curvaceous design made
totally of plastic, is now out of production. Vintage pieces go for
thousands of dollars. But Vitra recently reissued the design in a
less expensive plastic _ in vibrant red, blue, yellow, black and
white _ for about $200.
</P>
<P>
   The chair is a top seller for Reilly, who just three years ago
started his Internet business after surfing the Web to find
plastics for his extensive home collection. Today, the company
sells more than 5,000 products to consumers worldwide. This fall it
plans to move its tiny showroom off Monroe Drive to Midtown's 805
Peachtree Lofts building.
</P>
<P>
   At first, most of his business was vintage furnishings. Now,
that's rivaled by new designs, a sign, he said, of plastic's move
into the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   And that acceptance should only grow as interiors become
increasingly eclectic _ with traditional antiques mixing it up with
contemporary art, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly points to the Italians, harbingers of innovation in both
fashion and furniture. On a recent buying trip to Milan, he was
struck by how the city's restaurants were decorated.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had all this classic, old architecture,'' he said, ``and
juxtaposed with it were all these wonderful plastic chairs!''

   Q: I am looking for a jellylike Greek candy, coated in
confectioners' sugar and filled with a delicate raspberry, lemon
and cherry filling. A photographer friend bought me a box from
Greece. However, since the package label is in Greek, I can't even
tell you the manufacturer. Can you help me find the candy? I've
enclosed a sample of the sweet for you to try.
</P>
<P>
   _ Harvey Bourland, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a tough job, sampling candy from readers! But Bourland
is right _ it's a treat for those with a sweet tooth. We found a
similar candy at the International Bakery, 2165 Cheshire Bridge
Road N.E. (404-636-7580). A 1-pound box is $3.15. This candy is
manufactured by Krinos Foods Canada and is labeled a ``delicious,
authentic Greek delight.'' Our candy has the same consistency as
the sample but contains peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   Q: About 20 or 30 years ago, there was a superior salad
dressing, Milani's 1890 Dressing. All stores carried it, but now
the product seems to be extinct. Is it still being made and is it
available in the Atlanta area?
</P>
<P>
   _ Robert F. Elliott, McDonough, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Dress up those salad greens with your favorite Milani 1890
Dressing. It's still being produced in three flavors: French,
Italian and Red Wine Vinaigrette. However, the dressing can prove
difficult to find. You can order it from Precision Foods by calling
1-800-647-8170. A case (12 8-ounce bottles) is $20.80, which
includes shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would like to find the perfume Privilege. I understand that
it may not be manufactured anymore. Every time I wear it, someone
asks me what fragrance I am wearing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Marian Gravley, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Yet another perfume request: For two years, I have been
searching for Listen, a cologne by musician Herb Alpert.
</P>
<P>
   _ Maxine McDonald, Dunwoody, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   And a final perfume plea: I am looking for the perfume Moment
Supreme.
</P>
<P>
   _ Maria Harm, Lawrenceville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's back to the classics for many of you perfume lovers. All
these fragrances are at Scentimentals, 9700 Medlock Bridge Road,
Duluth (678-417-0422). Tara Ciul and her mother Anne Pelz own this
shop, which boasts more than 700 fragrances. But the duo can also
track down other scents, if they don't have them on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Privilege, which dates from 1986, is a blend of narcissus,
mosses and wood notes. A 6-ounce body powder is $20, the eau de
toilette is $25. Listen by Herb Alpert, the musician, is a melange
of florals, spices and wood notes. A 1.2-ounce bottle is $30. This
scent is also found at Perfume Outlet in Riverdale (770-997-6258).
Prices vary. Finally, Moment Supreme from Jean Patou debuted in
1929 and has a warm, subtle, spicy aroma with a floral base. A
2.5-ounce splash is $50.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard there's a company that makes ``green ketchup.'' Where
can I buy it?
</P>
<P>
   _ Max Nystrom, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: Kids of all ages will enjoy the lastest offering from the
H.J. Heinz Co. _ Blastini green ketchup. Called EZ Squirt, the
ketchup, which gets its unusual shade via food coloring, will be on
shelves of major grocery store chains in mid-October. A 24-ounce
bottle is $1.79.
</P>
<P>
   Both the green and traditional red ketchups will be available in
a kid-friendly, easy-to-handle bottle. A new nozzle provides kids
with better control and an ultra-thin stream that directs ketchup
exactly where they want it. Heinz developed the green condiment
with input from children across the country, since they consume
more than 5 billion ounces of ketchup each year, according to
Heinz. Why green? In tests, kids said it was their favorite color.
And how does it taste? Just like the red stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for a men's skin care lotion, ``Lab Series Skin
Rebuilder,'' by Aramis. My husband always bought it at Rich's, but
the item hasn't been there recently. Is there any other place I
could find it, or could I order it on the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   _ Jutta Peine-Wolski, Peachtree City, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Like many items we love, this one has been discontinued.
However, Aramis, which is part of the Estee Lauder company,
introduced U-Turn Age Defying Formula Gel as its replacement. This
product, according to a spokeswoman, ``works to firm and strengthen
the skin's appearance while protecting it from environmental
elements.'' The gel includes vitamins C and E and green tea
extract, whey protein and lactose. A 1.7-ounce bottle is $28,
available at stores with Aramis counters, including Macy's and
Rich's.

 &HT;     GM ROLLS OUT TRIO OF SUVs  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ General Motors is rolling out three new
sport-utility vehicles that are just what truck-loving Texas
consumers ordered.
</P>
<P>
   The three models are the all-new 2002 Cadillac Escalade, 2001
GMC Yukon Denali and 2001 GMC Yukon Denali XL (better known as the
Suburban).
</P>
<P>
   The Escalade, a full-size sport-utility based on the Yukon and
the Chevrolet Tahoe, will be built in General Motors' Arlington
plant, and will go on sale in January as an early 2002 model.
</P>
<P>
   And the Denali and Denali XL, the most expensive, most upscale
versions of the Yukon brand from GM's Janesville, Wis., factory,
will go on sale in mid-October as 2001 models. The Yukon and
Escalade are the same size as the Chevy Tahoe, while the Yukon XL
is GMC's new name for its version of the Suburban, a slightly
longer Yukon/Tahoe.
</P>
<P>
   This past model year, GM introduced the completely revised
Tahoe, Yukon, Suburban and Yukon XL, based on the all-new
full-sized GM pickups that debuted in 1999. Now, these upscale
versions of the Yukon Denali (Denali is the American Indian name
for Mount McKinley, meaning ``the high one'') as well as the new
Escalade are coming to market.
</P>
<P>
   All three of these high-end vehicles are expected to do well in
Texas, where General Motors' Suburban has been a best-seller for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   For Cadillac dealers, the Escalade promises to bring even more
younger, affluent and educated buyers into their showrooms than
ever, a shift that is essential to the survival of the Cadillac
brand.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors hastily introduced the first Escalade two years
ago as a gussied-up version of the Tahoe and Yukon to meet the
competition from the Lincoln Navigator, Ford's upscale version of
the full-size Expedition.
</P>
<P>
   Almost since the day the Escalade was introduced, GM has been
working on its replacement, and even though the first version sold
well, this new one is much more of a Cadillac and should give the
Navigator some serious competition, dealers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had customer interest in it for six months, and we
already have a list of customers waiting for it,'' said Steve
Sinclair, sales manager for Cavender Cadillac in San Antonio. ``All
we have to show them so far is some pictures of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many would-be Escalade buyers over the past two years chose the
Navigator instead, because it had a third row of seats and the
Escalade didn't, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new Escalade fixes that. The third seat is standard, and
with a bench seat in the middle row and two bucket seats up front,
it will hold up to seven people. And to add cargo capacity, the
third seat is split into two easily removable sections that weigh
just 35 pounds each.
</P>
<P>
   ``That third seat is a huge plus factor for us,'' Sinclair said.
``There were people coming in before who had small children or
carpools and needed that extra seating capacity, and we just didn't
have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other amenities that make it more of a Cadillac than before
include the StabiliTrak vehicle-stability system that is exclusive
to the Cadillac brand, as well as dual-zone automatic climate
control, a premium Bose audio system and Cadillac's new ultrasonic
rear parking-assist system, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, GM will offer a two-wheel-drive version of
the Escalade, aimed specifically at Sun Belt markets where
customers don't particularly need four-wheel drive, said Cadillac
spokesman Mike Albano.
</P>
<P>
   The two-wheel-drive model will come with a new Vortec 5.3-liter
V-8 engine rated at 285 horsepower and 325 foot-pounds of torque,
up from 255 hp in the 5.7-liter V-8 that came with the original
Escalade.
</P>
<P>
   Four-wheel-drive models come with a special version of GM's
Vortec 6.0-liter V-8, exclusive to the Escalade with its 345
horsepower and 380 foot-pounds of torque. That's more power than
any other GM sport-utility and far more than any other SUV in this
class.
</P>
<P>
   The Denali and Denali XL will have a version of the 6.0-liter
V-8 that turns out 320 horsepower and 365 foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   The extra power is just one way that GM will differentiate the
Escalade from the Denali. Price is another. Although no prices have
been announced yet for the Escalade, expect it to be a bit higher
priced than the Yukon Denali, which lists for $46,650 including
destination charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will cost more than the Denali because of the extra power
and some of the other Cadillac amenities,'' Albano said. The
current generation of the Escalade starts at about $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Denali and XL Denali ``have a confident, powerful new look
that underscores their enhanced capabilities and a higher degree of
refinement,'' GM says. They are slightly taller and wider than the
previous generation Yukon and Suburban, which helps provide
significantly more interior passenger room and added storage
capacity. Still, both fit into a standard residential garage, and
the Denali is sized for regular parking spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Length of the Denali is 198.9 inches, the same as the Escalade.
The larger Denali XL, with even more interior room, is 219.3 inches
long, like the Suburban and Yukon XL.
</P>
<P>
   The Denali XL, the fanciest Suburban to come straight from any
GM factory, will list for $48,185, including destination, and will
be exclusive to the GMC truck brand, said Lisa Grutta, assistant
brand manager for Denali.
</P>
<P>
   ``There won't be such an upscale version of the Chevrolet
Suburban, and there won't be an Escalade in the Suburban body
length,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many Suburban and Yukon XL buyers in Texas have their
vehicles customized and upgraded by aftermarket companies that
specialize in those brands. Grutta said she doesn't believe that
the new Denali XL will put any of those companies out of business,
but that the Denali XL will appeal to consumers who don't want the
uncertainties over factory warranty coverage that come with such
aftermarket customization.
</P>
<P>
   GMC dealers already are taking orders for the Denali and Denali
XL, which go into production Oct. 1. But Cadillac dealers don't yet
have the authority to take orders for the Escalade, Sinclair said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking names and will contact our customers when we can
begin taking orders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Demographics for the Escalade are a bit different from those for
the Denali and Denali XL, in that Escalade buyers are expected to
have an average household income of about $155,000, compared with
$110,000 or more for Denali buyers, GM said.
</P>
<P>
   Escalade's current sales proportion of 35 percent to female
buyers is expected to climb to 45 percent because of the third row
of seats, Albano said. Consumers are expected to be primarily
well-educated people, with an average age of 45 (down from
Escalade's current average buyer age of 50).
</P>
<P>
   For Denali, the managerial and entrepreneurial ranks are
expected to be well-represented among buyers, and the average age
of 45 also is expected for this brand, Grutta said.

   We're all Italian today.
</P>
<P>
   Shari Pitts lost one of her favorite recipes, the bow-tie pasta
with cream and ham that was served at the Worthington hotel (now
the Renaissance Worthington in downtown Fort Worth). We ran that
recipe in 1993, and here it is from our files.
</P>
<P>
   Then I received a request from John Long of Arlington, Texas,
for gnocchi, the potato pasta from Italy. Gnocchi means ``lumps''
in Italian, and that's pretty much what they resemble. Usually, the
gnocchi are ball-shaped and served with the same sauces you'd see
with spaghetti. You don't want a heavy sauce with these little guys
_ something that bathes them in flavor is best; a butter sauce, a
cream sauce or a tomato sauce all work well. We're running chef
Mario Batali's recipe.

   MARIO BATALI'S BASIC GNOCCHI
</P>
<P>
   Serves 12
</P>
<P>
   3 pounds russet potatoes
</P>
<P>
   2 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 extra-large egg
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup canola oil
</P>
<P>
   Place the whole potatoes in a saucepan with water to cover.
Bring to a boil and cook at a low boil until they are soft, about
45 minutes. While potatoes are still warm, peel them and pass them
through a vegetable mill onto a clean pasta board.
</P>
<P>
   Bring about 6 quarts of water to a boil. Set up an ice bath with
6 cups ice water nearby. Make a well in the center of the potatoes
and sprinkle all over with the flour. Break the egg into the center
of the well, add the salt, and, using a fork, stir into the flour
and potatoes as if you were making pasta. Once the egg is mixed in,
bring the dough together, kneading gently until a ball is formed.
Knead gently for 4 more minutes, until ball is dry to the touch.
</P>
<P>
   Divide the dough into 6 large balls. Roll each ball into ropes
that are 3/4 inch in diameter and cut the ropes into 1-inch-long
pieces. Flick the pieces off a fork or along the concave side of a
cheese grater to score the sides. Drop the dough pieces into the
boiling water and cook until they float to the surface, about 1
minute. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the gnocchi to the ice
bath. Meanwhile, continue with the remaining dough, forming ropes,
cutting 1-inch pieces, and flicking them off a fork. Continue until
all the gnocchi have been cooked, and allow them to sit several
minutes in the ice bath.
</P>
<P>
   Drain the gnocchi and transfer to a mixing bowl. Toss with the
canola oil and store covered in the refrigerator for up to 48 hours
or until ready to serve.

BRENDA RUSSELL POURS SEVEN YEARS OF SELF-REFLECTION INTO `PARIS
RAIN'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By MIKI TURNER 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only a handful of singer-songwriters can consistently write
tunes that inspire, encourage and challenge us at the same time.
One of them is Brenda Russell, who's back on the scene after a
self-imposed seven-year hiatus with a new CD called ``Paris Rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Russell hasn't been as commercially successful as Barry
Manilow, Carole King, John Lennon and Paul McCartney, Marvin Gaye,
Lionel Richie, Stevie Wonder, Joni Mitchell or any of the other
great lyricists of our time, she has written some pretty terrific
songs that routinely take us back to the days when we had time to
listen to a ``Piano in the Dark.''
</P>
<P>
   That Grammy-nominated Top Five composition along with the richly
crafted ``Get Here'' and her breakthrough hit ``So Good, So Right''
are just a few of the tunes that helped Russell take her rightful
place among the higher echelon of singer-songwriters. Her ascent,
however, has also been aided by her conviction. Her music can't be
typed, and ``Paris Rain'' with its intoxicating blend of ballads,
funk, Latin and Brazilian beats and jazz is no exception. It's her
first recording on the Hidden Beach//Epic label.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe in this album so much,'' Russell says while
flipping a few stray dreadlocks away from her face during lunch in
the San Fernando Valley. ``It's divinely inspired. I cried when I
first heard the music. It blew me away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Catch On,'' a delightful uptempo anthem celebrating the glory
of life, is the first release from Russell's new CD. But one of the
songs she's most excited about is ``Move the Moon,'' a track she
co-wrote with her idol, Carole King.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a little kid I used to have a lot of records that
had (Gerry) Goffin and King on them,'' Russell says. ``I didn't
know they were songwriters. Later, when `Tapestry' came out, I
remember sitting in a restaurant and I heard `I Feel the Earth
Move.' I thought, `This is what I want to do!' So you can imagine
how thrilled I was to be working with her. When we'd be at the
piano I'd be all business, but the moment I was out of her eyesight
I'd be dancing around like Snoopy!''
</P>
<P>
   Russell, who was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Canada,
experiences that same type of euphoria every time another artist
records her songs. Although the sultry-voiced alto recorded ``If
Only for One Night'' on her self-titled debut album in 1979, it
became a monster hit for crooner Luther Vandross several years
later. Also, ``Get Here,'' from her most commercially successful
project, ``Piano in the Dark,'' was moderately successful for
Russell but was a breakthrough hit for Oleta Adams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Songs are like babies to me. If you can't raise it, then
someone else has got to,'' Russell says. ``That's how I feel about
it. I knew `Get Here' was a hit song, but the record company I was
signed to at the time did not really believe in it enough to
promote it. When Oleta recorded it, I was like, `Thank
you God,' because I knew the first time I'd ever sang `Get Here' in
the United States, people were screaming at me from the audience. I
knew it was something special.''
</P>
<P>
   Motown hitmakers Holland-Dozier-Holland, Lennon and McCartney
and Sting are among the songwriters Russell says influenced her
early in her career. She concedes that most of the songs on the
seven albums she has recorded are autobiographical. ``Get Here,''
for example, was written when Russell was living in Sweden and
waiting for that special someone to get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always heard that a good writer writes about what they
know about,'' says Russell, who says ``So Good, So Right'' came to
her while she was washing dishes. ``I know about my experiences in
life. Also, it's like therapy for me. If it's therapy for me, then
I figure it will help somebody else, too. It's especially good for
heartbreak. Heartbreak makes great songs! It's therapeutic to get
it out in music.''
</P>
<P>
   EMI, Russell's former label, apparently didn't understand her
need for therapy, which is one of the reasons why she bolted after
1993's ``Soul Talkin'.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You put so much effort into a project _ and in my case, I'm
writing, singing, arranging and producing _ to have someone just
throw it out there and
see what happens was not good enough for me,'' Russell says. ``I
wanted to see what life was like without a record company, and it
was great. I got to really experience a much fuller life with less
stress. I had been working all the time with other artists on their
projects, traveling and working with writers around the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   During her hiatus Russell traveled all over the world, penned
tunes for Tina Turner, Diana Ross, Dionne Warwick and Patti
LaBelle, and contributed to the soundtracks for ``How Stella Got
Her Groove Back'' and ``Liberty Heights,'' a film she had a small
role in.
</P>
<P>
   She also took time to reflect.
</P>
<P>
   ``My spiritual evolution has been huge,'' Russell says. ``The
reason why I'm back out here actually is because God's kicking my
butt. Personally, I was listening to the music that was out there
and going, `I don't know where I fit
in here.' It wasn't very musical to me what was going on. I'm a
person who loves poetry. I was like, surprise me. Go somewhere
where I don't expect you to go. It just made sense to come back and
do what I do, and I'm grateful to be with a company now that wants
me to do just that.''

&HT;     49ER'S GARCIA CAN'T WIN FOR LOSING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KEVIN LYNCH  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco 49ers quarterback Jeff Garcia is
shivering in the long, dark shadow cast by Steve Young and Joe
Montana. No matter what he does, if he doesn't win, the comparisons
to these two will cast him in an ugly light.
</P>
<P>
   Take Sunday's loss in Atlanta. Garcia completed 23 passes, threw
for three touchdowns, and guided the team on four scoring drives.
He compiled a quarterback rating of 100.8, fourth-highest of any
quarterback on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was grousing about Garcia's performance. He didn't
spot open receivers, he missed passes, and he threw a devastating
and bone-headed interception that was returned for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the 49ers should be thrilled if Garcia replicates
Sunday's performance in each of the remaining 15 games. If Garcia
throws one interception for every three touchdown passes, no one
would complain. If his quarterback rating is more than 100 for the
season, that would be outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing one interception every 36 passes is no sin. Coach Steve
Mariucci said it's unusual to have an interception returned for a
touchdown, and he's right.
</P>
<P>
   On any given play, a quarterback has dozens of decisions to
make. Should he audible? Where should he throw? Should he move to
avoid the pass rush and when? Should he try to throw the ball away
if in trouble? When should he flee the pocket and make yards on his
own?
</P>
<P>
   One player guessed after watching the Atlanta tape that Garcia
made the right choices 90 percent of the time. Joe Montana and John
Elway were never right on 100 percent on their decisions in any
game. No quarterback has been that perfect. No one should quarrel
with 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Garcia was the losing quarterback, and with that, comes a
huge magnifying glass under which all his poor decisions are
unmercifully examined. Even under intense scrutiny, Garcia's
mistakes don't seem all the bad.
</P>
<P>
   Take Ashley Ambrose's third-quarter interception for a
touchdown. Linebacker Keith Brooking's blitz up the middle forced
Garcia to throw the ball falling away to Jerry Rice on the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if Garcia was tossing up a fall-away jump shot, and
thus, he didn't get any zip on the pass. The lollipop throw made
for an easy interception.
</P>
<P>
   Brooking came straight up the middle and was picked up late by
guard Ray Brown, who actually held him on the play. If Brown or
center Jeremy Newberry pick up Brooking earlier, Garcia has a safe
little pocket in which to throw.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Garcia could have made a better decision by either
running away from Brooking or throwing the ball away. And his
mistake was made all the more glaring because the game turned on
that play. The Ambrose score put the Falcons up by 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia also has to face the Quarterback Bias, a condition in
which the quarterback gets far too much credit for a win, and too
much blame for a loss.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Jim Druckenmiller's 1997 win against the Rams.
Druckenmiller, then a rookie, was forced to play because of a
concussion to starter Steve Young and backup Jeff Brohm's broken
finger.
</P>
<P>
   Druckenmiller completed 10 of 28 passes for 102 yards, a
touchdown and three interceptions, but the 49ers won 15-12, and
Druckenmiller drew praise. Some even thought Druckenmiller should
have started the next week over Brohm if Young wasn't ready.
</P>
<P>
   Druckenmiller was horrible. The 49ers only won the game because
of defense and special teams play.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, following Young and Montana doesn't help Garcia
either. They knew the offense so well and were so abundantly
talented. Against the backdrop of 20 years of Hall of Fame
quarterbacking, Garcia's in for a season of unfair comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Montana and Young were better than Garcia is now, but they
both played on teams with strong defenses and decent special teams.
</P>
<P>
   So Garcia is left to function in the dark. To toil in the shadow
of men who defined quarterbacking in the modern era. Maybe Garcia
isn't the long-term answer at quarterback, but he should at least
be given a chance to prove that he is.

BILLIONAIRE'S WIFE LAUNCHES HER OWN LINE OF HIGH-FASHION CLOTHING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ALYSON WARD 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ You've probably heard Susan Dell's name. Of
course, her name is almost always the second half of a phrase that
begins with ``Michael and'' _ her husband is computer magnate
Michael Dell, the Austin billionaire who made his fortune selling
pre-ordered PCs.
</P>
<P>
   If things go as Susan Dell plans, though _ and they usually do _
you'll soon be throwing her name around on its own. And if you have
the money, you'll quite possibly be wearing her name inside your
designer dresses, your business suits and your cashmere sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Dell has developed a line of high-fashion
designer clothing and has opened an Austin boutique to sell her
wares. But the Austin shop is just the friendly face on her
developing empire. Her company _ Susan Dell Inc. _ has a staff of
50 and occupies three floors on Seventh Avenue in New York. Dell
plans to keep expanding _ she'll open more shops in other cities
(she has her eye on Fort Worth-Dallas) and launch a Web site to
sell her clothing online.
</P>
<P>
   So the wife of the richest man in Texas (according to Forbes
magazine's 2000 ranking of billionaires) wants to become a heavy
hitter in the fashion world.
</P>
<P>
   Why? I called to request an hourlong interview _ and eight
months and perhaps 1,000 phone calls later, I got it.

<P>
   In that hour (which she generously allowed to turn into two), I
learned that Susan Dell isn't just a billionaire's wife; she's the
mother of four, a savvy businesswoman and quite a serious fashion
designer, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   In the time I spent seeking Susan Dell, though, I learned
something just as interesting: Whatever the public learns about
Dell, it will be precisely what she wants us to know _ and nothing
more.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   I started this story eight months ago. It was late January _ Y2K
panic was just dying down, and the presidential primaries were only
beginning _ when I learned about Dell's clothing line. My initial
call to Austin was promptly rerouted to New York, and I spent
months dealing with a string of Dell's PR representatives and
company employees. Reversing the usual procedure, they interviewed
me. ``What is the nature of the story you want to write?'' ``What's
your background in fashion reporting?'' ``Can you tell us anything
about yourself that might interest Susan?''
</P>
<P>
   What?
</P>
<P>
   Arranging this interview got more and more complicated.
Photography was banned, then welcomed. Conditions were set, then
withdrawn. In May, my interview request was turned down entirely; I
was told that Dell ``prefers not to do any more Texas press at this
time.'' By June, the story was renewed. I could have some time with
Dell in late August.
</P>
<P>
   I thought I was in. And I was. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Dell's store stands tall in an upscale shopping center in the
well-heeled Westlake area of Austin. The store is surrounded by
cafes, specialty shops and a parking lot full of Lexuses and
Mercedeses. Inside, the look is limestone and maple and glass _ a
tasteful, uncluttered design that complements Dell's tasteful,
uncluttered clothing line. Calla lilies rest in heavy glass vases,
and the summer sun pours in through full-length windows.
</P>
<P>
   The store was designed by Charles Gwathmey, the architect who
designed the addition to New York's Guggenheim Museum (and the
Dells' hilltop mansion). Fashion photography legend Lillian Bassman
did the photography for an ``image wall'' facing the front door.
</P>
<P>
   The shop is much like Dell herself: appealing and elegant, sleek
and sophisticated; nothing is out of place.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's company president, Linda Beauchamp, who founded Donna
Karan's menswear line, greets me at the door. Behind her, moments
later, Susan Dell appears.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, 36, is wearing a white sleeveless sweater and dark, fitted
tech-cotton twill pants, both part of the Susan Dell line. The look
is completed by a pair of black cowboy boots. (''I feel like `Texas
girl' today,'' she later says, explaining the way our clothes show
different sides of our personalities.)
</P>
<P>
   She is tall. She is professional. She is polite. And she is
efficient. She disappears after about a minute, deciding it would
be better to get some work done while Beauchamp gives us the grand
tour of the building.
</P>
<P>
   First, Beauchamp introduces the clothing, pointing out details,
colors and fabrics. The clothing displayed is sleek. Classic.
Timeless. Everything is made in Italy: day wear, evening wear,
couture clothing. A selection of jersey knits has just arrived; the
skirt and single-shoulder top can be worn alone or paired with a
stylish wraparound cardigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clothes are things you keep,'' Beauchamp explains. ``This
isn't about clothes that are disposable.''
</P>
<P>
   She takes me through the palatial dressing rooms, complete with
thick carpet, comfortable furniture and flattering lighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could stay in here all day,'' Beauchamp says, encouraging
me to lounge on the furniture. Leaning back, she admits, ``I had a
meeting in here with the store manager.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>

</P>
<P>
   I get glimpses of who the woman behind the name truly is. When I
am left in Dell's company, I discover that what I've read about her
is true: She doesn't sit. Dell is constantly moving here and there
_ adjusting material on a mannequin, showing pieces of her fall
collection. Her office was designed with a high countertop so she
can stand up to type, and the only chairs in the room are the four
child-size ones that surround a miniature table where her children
often play.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder she can't sit down, I think as Dell begins a monologue
about her business. Susan Dell is excited about fashion.
</P>
<P>
   She explains how she'll find color inspiration in a lipstick,
clothing on her children's dolls or the petal of a flower on the
table in a restaurant. She incorporates these colors into her
collection, weaving them together with elegant design.
</P>
<P>
   Dell studied fashion merchandising and design at Arizona State
University. She began designing her clothes and having them made;
when she got compliments, she began designing for friends.
Eventually, she decided to turn her passion into a business.
</P>
<P>
   Dell explains how her business is expanding perfectly on
schedule, just as her youngest children are starting to grow up
(her twins just turned 4).
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't something I suddenly decided to do,'' she says _
although fashion design hasn't always been her career, it's always
been in her blood.
</P>
<P>
   Dell talks a great deal about passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's clearly fashion,'' she says. ``I love fashion. I
love fabric, I love color, I love women's bodies _ all shapes and
all sizes. I think every woman should feel beautiful, confident,
empowered.''
</P>
<P>
   Her speech picks up speed as she talks about her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Susan Dell is a woman who's involved in many things,'' she
points out _ from philanthropy to business to family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wear a lot of hats.... This particular role is the one I'm
most passionate about, besides wife and mommy,'' she says. ``This
is what makes me tick. This is what lights my fire.... This is why
I can't sit down at work _ I'm so excited about work.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all her talk about passion at the office, it is the
stories Dell tells about her children that are the most revealing
and genuine; it's hard not to love how she encouraged her oldest
daughter or the way she understands her 4-year-old son. But family
stories are strictly off the record.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Am I in the room? I wonder. Dell and her staff are
excruciatingly careful about what they tell me. In front of me,
they openly discuss what should and shouldn't be done for press
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   While the photographer takes Dell's picture, I find myself
standing next to the store manager. On the record, of course, but
mainly just to make conversation, I ask her to tell me how she
ended up working for Susan Dell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably shouldn't,'' she says. ``I really can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Awkwardness follows. But I get used to it. By the end of the
interview, I forget I'm writing about a woman and her boutique; I
feel as if I've attempted to pry into classified government
information.
</P>
<P>
   Regal and charming, Beauchamp is the most open member of the
Susan Dell team. But even she won't allow us to take photos of her
_ ``I would rather it be about Susan,'' she says with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obvious guardedness, it is easy to like Dell.
</P>
<P>
   She debates the merits of lying on her stomach for a photo, head
propped on her hands and boots in the air. Is the pose dignified
enough? ``I don't want to look like _ `Cute chick does designs,' ''
she says, making everyone in the room laugh.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   I finally ask: So why did it take eight months to get an
interview?
</P>
<P>
   ``My schedule is pretty tight,'' Dell says.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed; she's often out of town, working in New York or
overseas. And when she's in Austin, she explains, time-consuming
interviews keep her from doing the work she loves.
</P>
<P>
   That's why there's a multilevel buffer zone between Dell and
annoying reporters like me. Those buffers ask questions, get
specifics, and decide if the request seems reasonable _ or, as Dell
puts it, ``makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, this seemed strange and suspicious to me. Since
January, I've been wondering why a business _ and a new designer _
would turn down the free publicity my story would offer. Now I
think I understand.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a fashion story, really, examining the work of a new
designer. It's not a business story, either. It's a personality
profile of a woman who doesn't really want her personality
profiled. And it's an opportunity for us all to gaze at the
activities of one of the world's wealthiest people.
</P>
<P>
   Dell recognizes this. I think she even forgives me for being
curious.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what I do or don't do, people will be inquisitive,''
she says. ``We are in the public eye.''
</P>
<P>
   She's in the public eye, yes, but Susan Dell is clearly,
beautifully, in control.

&HT;     FEDS BUILDING DATABASE ON CAT DNA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Impressed by cases in which cat hair has helped
solve crimes, the federal government is bankrolling a two-year,
$265,000 project to develop a national database of genetic
information from cats.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and the U.S. Department of Justice are asking
volunteers to send samples of their cats' DNA to a federal
laboratory near Washington. The genetic material could be used to
identify cat blood, hairs or tissue found at crime scenes,
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being able to identify an individual domestic animal can be a
powerful aid to solving a crime,'' said Lisa Forman, the acting
director of the investigative and forensic sciences division at the
Office of Science and Technology, part of the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   In several cases, animal blood or hair found on bodies or
clothing at crime scenes has helped the police in tracking down
suspects. By using genetic techniques to identify the animal breed
_ sometimes even a specific animal _ investigators have charged
criminals on whose bodies those cats or dogs had rubbed, snuffled
or snoozed.
</P>
<P>
   A celebrated case occurred recently in Canada: The Royal
Canadian Mounted Police charged a man of killing his estranged wife
using on genetic identification of hair from his cat, Snowball. The
man was convicted.
</P>
<P>
   In developing the feline DNA database, ``we're trying to get
about 50 (cat DNA) samples from each breed. There are about 35
breeds, so we need upwards of 1,600 samples,'' said geneticist
Marilyn Menotti-Raymond of the Laboratory of Genomic Diversity,
part of the National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is shaped like two intertwined
spiral staircases and carries the genes or chemical codes that tell
cells how to grow in all living organisms.
</P>
<P>
   The feline DNA database, once completed, would let investigators
identify hair, blood or tissue samples from specific breeds of
cats. In the past, investigators could examine hair from a crime
scene and say whether it came from a cat or dog, but that's about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone interested in the program should first write for
information to: Dr. Marilyn Menotti-Raymond, Laboratory of Genomic
Diversity, National Cancer Institute, Building 560/Room 11-38, Fort
Detrick, Frederick, MD 21702.
</P>
<P>
   Forman said the Justice Department has no immediate plans to
develop a database of dog DNA.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even without my trusty Rand McNally, it's not hard
to recognize that I'm in California.
</P>
<P>
   Road signs on Highway 1 direct me to vineyards. The passenger
window is open so I can hear the ocean hitting the rocks. And when
I reach Santa Barbara, the gas-station cashier is stationed in
front of a towering carved coffee bar. She can't locate the
restroom key for me, but she can put a mean head on a cappuccino.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific hem of California is far different from the fabric
that makes up the rest of the state. Here, things seem ethereal,
almost otherworldly _ until, whack, you hit the freeways of Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   I was determined not to do as my father had done 35 years
earlier. We had just spent a week driving across the country to his
next assignment, at Vandenberg Air Force Base outside Lompoc. We
hit LA at dark, with the tangled ribbons of headlights coming at us
from all directions. My father, after three years of driving in
sane and stoic Norway, was, well, he was freaked.
</P>
<P>
   I was not going to do the same. I called ahead to my sister,
asking for directions to her house. Which interstate to take, which
exit to take, which interstate to take next. I was ready.
</P>
<P>
   One hour later, I called her again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget it, I'm lost; I'm checking into a hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not you're not _ the Democratic Convention is in town.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So maybe I'll run into Rob Lowe.''
</P>
<P>
   But no, much younger sister had another idea and, via cellphone,
she reeled me in. But I agree with my father; for the rest of my
time in Los Angeles, I decided to walk.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, you can walk in Los Angeles, even in August. There are
neighborhoods, with restaurants, in which you can walk. So although
my meals for the next few days were geographically limited, they
were hardly restricted.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Farmers Market, Fairfax and Third Street, south of
Hollywood &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Locals bemoan that the Farmers Market, a Los Angeles institution
since 1934, is no longer home to real farmers. Instead, each peach
has a paper sticker identical to the ones on the peaches in the
Albertsons across the street.
</P>
<P>
   The locals should gripe about something else _ like the traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But imagine; here's a place that doesn't charge for parking, has
outdoor seating you can use year-round and newspapers from around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Although most California supermarkets didn't show me much (I am
eating my complaints about Texas grocery stores), the farmers
market almost made up for it. Here you'll find the Mr. Marcel
Cheese Shop with offerings that go beyond the havarti that seems to
be the apex at the popular Trader Joe's. Mr. Marcel also stocks
olives by the pound and a terrific selection of caviar. Or try
Thee's Continental Pastries, where a sign announced ``First of the
season _ Pflaumenkuchen.''
</P>
<P>
   And the restaurant offerings are fabulous. Try Moishe's for
shish kebab or falafel or more mundane rotisserie chicken. Or order
from one of the Filipino staff at the French Crepe Co. The opera
crepe (No. 7 if you're counting) is $5.85 and includes Swiss
cheese, avocado, onions and tomato and is paired with the wonderful
field greens salad dressed with a mustard vinaigrette. They'll call
your name at the counter, but you can eat outdoors, on a real
plate, and servers clean up.
</P>
<P>
   Swingers Hollywood Diner, 8020 Beverly Blvd., (323) 653-5858 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, I am in Los Angeles. So many pretty people, you hope to
spy someone overweight in a Bedazzled T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   My 5-foot-10-inch tall, 120-pound sister leaned across the table
as we were making our way through the menu.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I never believed that there were people who actually
had ribs removed to look thinner until I moved here. Some of these
people, I wonder how they have room for their intestines.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, they're obviously not really eating at Swingers _ hanging
out, maybe, drinking water maybe, but obviously not eating. (Well,
they might be checking out the staff. On our visit, a trio of
Amazon women who looked as if they once danced behind Robert Palmer
were waiting tables. They'd changed out of the black dresses,
though, and wore micromini schoolgirl pleated skirts and knee-high
black boots.
</P>
<P>
   It made eating my ahi tuna sandwich a little difficult. I
wondered where they were keeping their intestines.
</P>
<P>
   In-N-Out Burger, 140 locations in California, Nevada and
Arizona &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In-N-Out Burger is to Southern California what Whataburger is to
Texas _ the hometown burger. The places are packed, day and night.
And I wasn't in town during the car giveaway, the annual autumn
promotional event that packs in car-crazy Angelenos.
</P>
<P>
   In-N-Out Burger was started by Harry and Esther Snyder in 1948;
it was the first California burger spot with a drive-through
window. Esther still shows up at the office, and the chain has
grown to 140 stores.
</P>
<P>
   The best stuff at In-N-Out Burger is not on the menu. A burger
ordered ``animal style'' is a hamburger topped with fried onions,
both grilled in mustard. A ``protein burger'' is the hamburger with
the works _ minus the bun. Instead, the meat and topping are
wrapped in lettuce leaves. Or, if you're on the opposite end of the
food chain, order the ``wish burger,'' or the ``I wish I had a
burger.'' That's the bun and all the toppings, minus the meat.
</P>
<P>
   You just gotta love LA.

 &HT;    Prim, proper &AMP; polished
 &HT;    By Emily Rahimi
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Who says prim and proper can't be fun, or that
etiquette doesn't apply to teen-agers?
</P>
<P>
   Now that baggy jeans and chunky shoes are out of style,
polished, more sophisticated looks have taken center stage.
</P>
<P>
   For teens and collegians, that means this season's filled with
blouses, skirts and slacks. Though shapes are classic, they're
anything but boring.
</P>
<P>
   Bright colors (used in moderation) and animal prints (ditto) are
hot right now and can make a traditional look a lot of fun. Try
pairing a pewter sweater with a leopard print mini-skirt, or wear a
shiny, blue blouse with cropped wool slacks for a style that's
classy but still young.
</P>
<P>
   Leather is also a cool way to stay warm this autumn. The Gap
carries great pants, skirts and jackets in hues ranging from plum
to black. But don't think you need to break the bank to get this
look. Many stores also offer pleather pieces, which give you the
look of buttery leather at the price of plastic.
</P>
<P>
   If you just can't part with your T-shirts and jeans, check out
items with more refined shapes and colors. Try a rayon T-shirt with
slim-fit, dark denim jeans and matching jacket. You'll look clean,
put together and oh-so-well-bred. With so many options, why not go
out and play with convention?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to understand why so many otherwise attractive
people totally destroy their appearance by chewing gum like a cow
chewing a cud. Chewing gum, in itself, if it is done quietly and
unobtrusively, is not unattractive. But when one does it with
grimaces, open mouth, smacks, crackers and pops and worth of all
with bubbles, it is with the worst of taste.''

   It is the impulse of all young persons to try to be as exactly
like each other as biscuits in a pan. During the war, groups of
teen-age girls across the country have taken to the sloppiest of
over-sized boys clothes worn in the sloppiest way.

loveliness _ takes its place, no one can say. It can only be hoped
that the behavior that goes with pants and shirttail out will not
have been found ineradicable.

 &HT;    Fireplace `backsmoking' might be culprit behind wall stain
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - J.M. of Springboro had a room addition with a
wood-burning fireplace added to her house about four years ago, and
ever since she's had a problem with smoke stains high on the walls
of the great room adjoining the addition. She uses the fireplace
four or five nights a week during cold weather and fears the walls
she just had repainted will become smudged again if she can't solve
her problem before the heating season starts. Her house doesn't
have natural gas, so a natural gas fireplace is not an option.
</P>
<P>
   Suggestion: Caryl Hoelscher of Abbey Road Chimney Sweeps says
soot stains high on the wall usually are caused by soot that can
come from frequent candle burning or from a fireplace that is
``backsmoking,'' which means releasing some smoke from the firebox
instead of sending it all up the chimney. To see if a fireplace is
releasing smoke indoors, Hoelscher suggests shining a strong
flashlight across the face of the fireplace. The beam will
illuminate smoke particles that might otherwise be invisible.
</P>
<P>
   Hoelscher and a technical adviser for Temco Fireplaces, the
manufacturer of J.M.'s fireplace, said smoke escaping from a
fireplace is often related to negative air pressure in the room.
Modern houses are so tightly constructed that outside air has a
hard time getting into the house. Anything that draws air out of
the room _ for example, the air-intake duct of the furnace or an
exhaust fan _ can reduce the air pressure in the room to the point
that smoky air inside the fireplace is sucked out. It's sometimes
necessary to crack a window near a fireplace to provide a fresh-air
source.
</P>
<P>
   Other possible problems with the fireplace include an
incorrectly positioned vent opening on the roof above the room
addition or an improperly installed fireplace. J.M. got a toll-free
number to contact Temco's customer service department and can
explore the problem further with them.
</P>
<P>
   BRICK EXTERIOR CRACKS
</P>
<P>
   OK IF THEY'RE SMALL
</P>
<P>
   Cracks are forming in the brick exterior of L.H.'s house in
Huber Heights, and she's concerned that she has a serious problem
and that the neighbors will think she's letting her house go to
pot. The cracks started appearing in the past couple of years along
the mortar between rows of bricks and at windows. A few bricks are
also cracked. Most of the cracks are 1/8-inch or less. She wants to
know what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   Suggestion: Cracks as small as the ones L.H. is seeing aren't
especially unusual or serious. Cracks form when the soil under the
house shifts, putting stress at points such as window seals and
corners. Foundation experts say the dry weather the Dayton area has
had for the past few years has created unusual cracking because the
clay soils common in the Miami Valley tend to contract a bit when
they get dry. As long as the cracks aren't large enough to stick a
finger through, and the basement walls don't bow inward or lean,
it's not time to panic. L.H. should keep an eye on the cracks to be
sure they are expanding or moving. She should put a piece of tape
across the worst cracks, then check back in a few days. If the tape
is twisted, that means the wall is continuing to shift rapidly, and
it's time to call in a professional to take a look. Extensive
shifting may require excavation and foundation reinforcement to
correct, and that's expensive.
</P>
<P>
   When the weather cools a bit, she should apply a little silicone
and latex caulk to visible cracks in the mortar. Caulk waterproofs
the cracks so rain doesn't reach the sheathing underneath. Caulk
applied during moderate fall weather should be able to stretch to
keep covering the cracks when they are at their widest during the
coldest days of winter. Hardware and home-improvement stores carry
caulk colored to match concrete approximately, but don't expect an
invisible repair.
</P>
<P>
   If the cracks between bricks have stabilized and aren't growing,
the problem can be fixed more or less permanently by tuckpointing.
Tuckpointing involves removing some of the deteriorating mortar
between the bricks and replacing it with fresh mortar. You can get
tips on tuckpointing from places where bricks and mortar are sold.
It will keep you hunched in front of a brick wall for hours at a
time, but it's a job the average do-it-yourselfer can handle with a
little instruction.
</P>
<P>
   CAULK, RIGHT DIMENSIONS
</P>
<P>
   SHOULD FIX LEAKY SHED
</P>
<P>
   M.H. of Fairborn built a storage shed in his yard using a kit
from Arrow Sheds. He built the shed on a platform of treated
plywood. When it rains, water seeps into the shed along the bottom
of the walls. He wants to know how to keep the inside portion of
the plywood platform dry.
</P>
<P>
   Suggestion: A spokeswoman for Arrow Sheds said M.H. should work
inside the shed and apply caulk at the lines where the walls of the
shed meet the plywood. The caulk will create a watertight barrier
that will keep rain out.
</P>
<P>
   Arrow's Web site says the best base for one of their sheds is a
level concrete pad, but plywood also works. The spokeswoman said
the trick is not to make the platform too large. The plywood should
be cut so the lip around the shed is no more than 9/16 of an inch
wide. Arrow sheds have overhangs at their roof lines that keep rain
from running down the outside walls. If the plywood only extends a
short distance outside the walls of the shed, the overhangs carry
the water out far enough that the wood stays dry and doesn't
provide a path to the interior.

BENEATH THE PRICKLY EXTERIOR OF THE CACTUS, LIES A SWEET FRUIT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BEVERLY BUNDY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beauty, abuela says, is more than skin deep.
</P>
<P>
   Grandmother must be from the Southwest. She probably grew up
with a stand of prickly pear cactus fronting the adobe and could
see the beauty beneath the sun-weathered pads of this needle-ridden
fellow. And she, because she was accumulating her motherly wisdom,
must have recognized the bounty these plants produce in the worst
of the desert summer.
</P>
<P>
   In August and September, it's easy to miss the glory of cactus
fruit. Certainly, it's more comfortable to keep to the
air-conditioning in the dire heat. But a field trip, particularly
to the homes of wise neighbors who have xeriscaped their property,
would reveal Texas' state plant festooned with ``tunas,'' the red
fruit or ``pears'' that are the yin to the yang of the paddles of
the prickly pear cactus.
</P>
<P>
   This survivor may well be one of the wonders of the flora
universe.
</P>
<P>
   When the paddles are young and relatively spine-free, they're
appealing to cattle as feed. Some pioneers in straw bale
construction have experimented with using juice from the cactus as
an ingredient in the plaster that seals the walls.
</P>
<P>
   The mature paddles can be shorn of prickles and slivered into
julienne used in everything from omelets to vegetarian tacos to
salads. The strips can also be battered and deep-fried, a la okra,
which has a similar viscous quality.
</P>
<P>
   But the crowns on these thorns are the fruits that ripen in the
hottest months. Twisted warm from the plant, a broken tuna reveals
lush garnet flesh flecked with tiny black seeds. The flavor is
sweetish, but not cloying. And the color makes for dishes that are
meal stoppers.
</P>
<P>
   If lucky, you have a source for local tunas. If not, then
specialty produce purveyors are here to assist you. Look for tunas
in the ``gourmet'' department of the fruit section of your
supermarket. If your supermarket doesn't tend toward the outre,
find the fruit at Hispanic markets.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to peel the fruit well; the hide contains
glochidia, tiny 1/32-inch long spines that are as thin as hairs yet
sharp, nonetheless. Straining the seeds from the flesh is usual,
but not absolutely necessary.

It makes for scandalous TV movie dish to imagine former Guns N'
Roses lead guitarist Slash out of a job.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That somewhere, the best hard-rock ax man of the late '80s is
wandering the Los Angeles backstreets looking for a gig, a guitar
dangling from his shoulder, a curly black mane tumbling in his face
from under a crooked top hat, a cigarette dangling loosely from his
lips.
</P>
<P>
   He limply knocks on the doors of old G N' R haunts like the
Troubadour and Roxy asking for one last shot. As the doors are
slammed, he sullenly wonders how fame can be so fleeting and how a
superstar band can disintegrate.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, a great story, but hardly true.
</P>
<P>
   Tipping a glass at a Madison, Wis., pub before a gig with his
band, Slash's Snakepit, he is the voice of rejuvenation. His senses
are stimulated like an up-and-coming rock star finding his way for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Any trace of the 35-year-old superstar of G N' R _ a heavy-metal
band once so huge that the current god of thunder, Metallica,
opened for it _ dissolved with that band's demise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so ecstatic right now because I have been here before,''
says Slash (born Saul Hudson in Stoke-on-Trent, England), sounding
celebratory talking into his cell phone. ``The record's not even
out yet, and we're going out there and playing it for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since he left G N' R five years ago, Slash's
Snakepit is fielding a lineup that its namesake feels could be a
lasting foundation. The new record, ``Ain't Life Grand,'' will be
in stores Oct. 10, but the group is bringing the slither den to
audiences of thousands as the opening band for AC/DC.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Slash subconsciously does see a little of past good
fortune in his future. His signature guitar turns of squelched
feedback-to-raid sirens once combined with G N' R vocalist Axl
Rose's churlish screams to make hard-rock history in the '80s. If
he's privately making comparisons, he's publicly guarded about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A retro outlook is a waste of time,'' Slash says. ``I won't
tear apart the albums that we did because Guns is still very close
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Today Slash knows that going No. 1 like G N' R's major-label
debut, ``Appetite for Destruction,'' did in 1988 isn't likely. The
possibility of selling 15 million albums, as ``Appetite for
Destruction'' did (it's been on Billboard's Top Pop Album Catalog
chart for 472 weeks and counting), just isn't real for heavy metal
right now.
</P>
<P>
   Even if G N' R, on some extreme outside chance, got back
together to give it another headbang, it would be near impossible
to reach those numbers. Not that there's a worry of that happening
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Slash addresses the idea of working with Rose again (a question
he has had to answer daily for five years) tersely: ``Probably
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Guns N' Roses started walking away from the band
after it stalled creatively following ``The Spaghetti Incident,'' a
1993 collection of punk covers that turned out to be the band's
final album.
</P>
<P>
   The decision for Slash to split ultimately came down to a
difference in creative direction. He wanted to stick with the
Stratocaster old-style rock that had built G N' R. Axl was more
interested in testing the limits of computer technology on music.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Axl and I) had 11 rehearsals together around 1995,'' Slash
says. ``Through those, we learned what we needed to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Slash still talks to some of his former G N' R mates _
guitarists Gilby Clarke and Izzy Stradlin and bassist Duff McKagan
_ but says he and Rose haven't spoken since those sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Rose has been something of a recluse since the demise of the
band in 1993. He's a strong believer in psychotherapy, past-life
regression and New Age medicine. Musically he has been working on
the next G N' R album, the techno-enhanced ``Chinese Democracy,''
for six years _ with no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   For Slash, leaving G N' R meant freedom and consistency: freedom
to work on music that he calls ``against the grain,'' meaning not
conducive to what pop trends are; consistency to put together a
band that he feels will be together to record several albums into
the future.
</P>
<P>
   The new lineup of Slash's Snakepit for ``Ain't Life Grand'' is
made up of virtual unknowns in similar musical circles. Guitarist
Kerri Kelli once played in Ratt, and drummer Matt Laug has worked
behind Alice Cooper. Teddy ``Zigzag'' Andreadis played keyboards on
past G N' R tours, and Johnny Blackout played with Slash in his
short-lived cover band, Slash's Blues Ball.
</P>
<P>
   The key element, however, is vocalist Reed Jackson. Even Slash
allows that finding a voice that complements his guitar as well as
Rose's was a tall order. He says he auditioned several hundred
singers from all over the country before finding Jackson right in
his own L.A. neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know exactly what it is I'm looking for in a singer,
but I know when I hear it,'' Slash says. ``I think someone was
intentionally hiding him from me. It took about two seconds to know
he was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Slash's Snakepit was initially created five years ago as sort of
a pastime between G N' R albums. It featured Slash and ex-Gunner
Clarke on guitar, Matt Sorum on drums, Dizzy Reed on keyboards,
Mike Inez from Alice in Chains on bass, and vocalist Eric Dover
from Jellyfish. It was dubbed ``snakepit,'' after the name given to
Slash's in-house studio where they rehearsed.
</P>
<P>
   A quickly recorded album, ``It's 5 O'Clock Somewhere,'' was put
together in 1995. Geffen, still hoping that G N' R would continue
to be a cornerstone franchise for the label, showed good faith by
releasing it.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a disorganized record of loose jams dotted with
heavy blues guitar influences descended from the Rolling Stones and
Aerosmith. It rose to No. 70 on the Billboard charts on name
recognition alone, but it quickly dropped when it didn't measure up
to the tight, raging gloss of G N' R.
</P>
<P>
   Now Slash admits that ``It's 5 O'Clock Somewhere'' was a project
spawned from boredom. The songs were demo-quality at best and
weren't ready for release. He refers to the new ``Ain't Life
Grand'' as the official debut from Slash's Snakepit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the result of wanting to get back to business when Guns
got held up,'' Slash says. ``I was supposed to return to my day
job, but I came back and didn't like my day job anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ain't Life Grand'' is much more complete and a more worthy
companion to the G N' R catalog. ``Been There Lately'' is about as
close a reference to the past as Slash allows. But with Jackson's
soul-tattooed vocals, the song bears more a resemblance to Southern
blues rock.
</P>
<P>
   With its tinkling-toy opening, ``Serial Killer'' is a dark
thriller. Other standouts _ ``Landslide'' and ``Just Like
Anything'' _ are a convergence between Soundgarden feedback and
Living Color's experimental blues and funk beneath teeth-baring
guitar beats.
</P>
<P>
   Describing himself as an anchor without a ship before this new
Snakepit, Slash is now relieved. He keeps going back to the
stability of this band and how painful it was to watch members of
the original G N' R leave, only to be replaced by uncomplementary
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   He has the jitters when he goes onstage again.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good sign,'' Slash says. ``If I don't have jitters,
it usually means I'll (stink).''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly he missed the work. He'd already planning for the
Snakepit's own headlining tour after the AC/DC gig runs out and
says the band will be right back in the studio after that. A long
layoff between albums, as was G N' R's penchant, does not seem
likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked as hard as I could on those albums while we were
making them,'' Slash says. ``Now I don't even own copies.''

HOLLYWOOD YOUNG BLOOD GIVES A DIFFERENT LOOK TO THE ACTION THRILLER
IN ``THE WAY OF THE GUN''
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
Director Christopher McQuarrie was dead-set against Ryan Phillippe
for the starring role in ``The Way of the Gun''.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``He was not at all what I imagined (his character) Parker to
be,'' McQuarrie said. ``Artisan (the studio) was very excited about
Ryan and was convinced he could do it. I just couldn't imagine
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that's rare _ and refreshing. Once a movie is made, the
director usually insists that the star he got was always his first
choice, no matter how hard he really fought to get someone else.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that such filmmakers are lying, exactly; it's just
that, well, the director has convinced himself that Phillippe was
who he really wanted all along. Call it artistic self-delusion.
</P>
<P>
   First-time director McQuarrie, who scripted ``The Usual
Suspects,'' felt that using Phillippe, currently hot with teen
audiences, would work against the dark, edgy tone he wanted for
``The Way of the Gun'', which opens Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is an action film that both honors and wryly mocks the
thriller genre by twisting its conventions. The large ensemble cast
features young performers, including Benicio Del Toro, Juliette
Lewis, Taye Diggs, Nicky Katt and Phillippe, plus old pros James
Caan and Scott Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Del Toro, a buddy of McQuarrie's who helped develop the film's
story and tone, was set to play Longbaugh, one of two buddy
criminals who kidnap a pregnant surrogate mother (Lewis) to hold
her undelivered baby for ransom.
</P>
<P>
   McQuarrie had his own ideas about how to cast the role of Del
Toro's partner, and said no to Phillippe, 25, even though the young
actor was sizzling from roles in the teen hits ``I Know What You
Did Last Summer'' and ``Cruel Intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillippe, calling from Chicago, said McQuarrie was reluctant
because of the actor's ``lightweight'' films.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two that I've done have been fairly successful, so I'm
identified with that in the (film) community,'' Phillippe said.
</P>
<P>
   But the actor refused to accept a rejection until he had a
meeting with the director.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Phillippe) said, `Look, I'm an actor, and people are
trying to make me a movie star. I'm just not going to do that,'''
McQuarrie recalled. ``I very much respected that approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillippe told the director he would put on muscle and change
his appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of hounded him,'' Phillippe said.
</P>
<P>
   McQuarrie finally relented.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `You know, Ryan, let's not change who you are. Let's
re-think the role so it's one that suits you.'''
</P>
<P>
   When Phillippe showed up for rehearsals six weeks later, he
didn't look like the teen-scream cover boy anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put on 25 pounds of muscle,'' Phillippe said. ``I worked out
five days a week and drank protein shakes _ did a lot to change
myself physically and the way I talk, and kind of came up with a
whole different guy. Or at least I tried to.''
</P>
<P>
   He also had a scruffy beard and cropped hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked exactly like Parker needed to be,'' McQuarrie said.
``I went back to the way Parker had been.''
</P>
<P>
   The character names Parker and Longbaugh were the real names of
turn-of-the-century outlaws Butch Cassidy (Robert LeRoy Parker) and
the Sundance Kid (Harry Longbaugh). McQuarrie, a movie buff,
included a lot of references _ verbal and visual _ to such film
favorites as ``The Magnificent Seven'' and ``The Wild Bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   But his Parker and Longbaugh are not the sweet charmers that
Paul Newman and Robert Redford made Butch and the Kid. They don't
hesitate to kill people who get in their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm going to make a movie about criminals,'' McQuarrie
said, ``what I don't want to do is go down the road of making
criminals sympathetic _ giving them reasons and justifications and
qualifications for their deeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that really repellent and, frankly, too easy. I was
more interested in following two characters who were bad people. We
were not allowed to see their past lives or dysfunctional
childhoods. You were forced to make a judgment. No effort was made
to make the audience happy.''
</P>
<P>
   McQuarrie may be misjudging the ability of viewers to find
positive attributes in his heroes. His Parker and Longbaugh seem
cool and hip in their enigmatic detachment _ especially as played
by Del Toro and Phillippe.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no doubt that ``The Way of the Gun'' turns
action-movie conventions on end. Like an early gunfight in which we
hear, but don't see, most of the shooting. Or a cat-and-mouse car
chase in which the pursued and pursuing go so slowly they actually
push the cars with their feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to make something different,'' McQuarrie said.
``I don't know how far away from the conventions I got, but I was
definitely trying to make a film that said, `OK, you've shown up to
see a crime story: Here's what guns really sound like; here's what
criminals really are; here's what consequences really are.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the action is so explosive, the situations so bizarre,
that moviegoers may come out of the theater feeling like they've
been hit by a truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now to me, that would be a good thing,'' Phillippe said. ``Far
too many movies, we don't feel anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his fight to get the role, Phillippe said diving into
the mind-set of his desperate character was a real switch,
especially learning to look handy with the many weapons in the
film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is strange, 'cause I didn't grow up in the South, where
(guns are) a little more common. I grew up on the East Coast
(Delaware). We never went out hunting. I never really held a gun.
My mother wouldn't let me have toy guns. Which I think was pretty
forward-thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``On some level, as a guy, you can't help feeling like you're
playing cops and robbers. I trained with a SWAT team member and a
Navy SEAL. It's fascinating. It is a power thing. There's something
about the gun and what it represents.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillippe, who gained early popularity playing Billy Douglas,
daytime TV's first gay teen, on ``One Life to Live,'' 1992-93, is
married to actress Reese Witherspoon. They had their first child,
daughter Ava Elizabeth Phillippe, when he was shooting ``The Way of
the Gun'' last fall. That gave Phillippe an instant connection to
the script.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotionally, I was connected to the movie because we had
similar themes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pregnancy angle was also a primary interest for McQuarrie.
After his big success with ``The Usual Suspects'' script _ for
which he won a 1995 Oscar _ no studio was interested in any film
idea from him unless it was a crime movie. He wanted to direct a
film about Alexander the Great and has tried to get it off the
ground for years.
</P>
<P>
   But like actors and directors, writers get typecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Benicio Del Toro said, `Look, if you want to make a movie your
way, you're going to have to make the kind of movie they want.' But
my heart wasn't in it,'' McQuarrie said.
</P>
<P>
   That changed with his ``The Way of the Gun'' story gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my wife who gave me the idea about the surrogate
mother. I was hooked; I was back into it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to coming up with the kernel of the idea, Heather
Neely McQuarrie was also the film's costume designer.
</P>
<P>
   McQuarrie immediately envisioned one of the film's most bizarre
tongue-in-cheek scenes, in which three gunmen and a doctor are
trapped in a weapons-cocked stand-off over a woman having a
Caesarean section.
</P>
<P>
   ``That literally was the image. I thought, `What are all the
things that could go wrong?' It was almost an instant connection
from `surrogate mother' to `guys in a birthing room shooting it
out.'''

   Home Section stories from The N.Y. Times News Service for Thursday,
Sept. 7:
</P>
<P>
   BRIT-U.S.-COUPLES (London) - Like the main character in ``Single
Process,'' a novella in her new book, ``Four Blondes'' (Atlantic Monthly
Press), Candace  Bushnell appears to have found love at last with a suave
Brit after years of exasperation  with the New York dating game. By
Christopher Mason.
</P>
<P>
   ANGLO-AMERICAN-ROMANCE (Undated) - The British male represents
something that has gone missing from his American counterpart: chivalry.
Hence, many American women find the British male to be the ultimate
challenge. Where I live in Notting Hill, Anglo-American alliances are
practically as numerous as the Mercedes estate cars parked outside. By
Helen Kirwan-Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   PET-HEALTH-SPAS (New York) - The latest pet spas  are beginning to
offer the same therapies available to humans - from electro-stimulation to
underwater treadmills. Ten years ago, physical therapy was mainly for
people.   But today, as pets become more prized, and  a booming economy
creates more discretionary income,  pet care extends to  surgery  and $400
customized weight-loss programs at health spas. By Julie V. Iovine.

</P>
<P>
   LIST-MAGAZINE (New York) - Reading the telephone book used to be a joke
until List magazine, also exclusively a collection of lists, appeared in
June. Four thousand copies later (at $15 a pop), the new magazine's last
laugh is the next item on the editors' list: Issue 2 arrives in October.
The White Pages, at least, are free. Detractors and admirers - along with
List's creative directors, Lisa Ano, 28, and Serge Becker, 39, who are
designers by background - like to think of List as a kind of literary
Armageddon: the arguments of the traditional magazine piece stripped to a
corrosive litany of disinterested facts. By William L. Hamilton.

in Miami Beach and more than 1,000 other projects, was in town recently, he
had lunch with his  colleague Philip Johnson as well as his former clients,
the brothers Tisch. Between lunches with friends and meetings with
manufacturers to discuss licensing his product designs, Mr. Lapidus sat
briefly in Central Park, recounting for the New York Times some of his most
memorable New York projects and looking back on his life as a contrarian.

 &HT;    SOME IN CONGRESS SNUB HASTERT'S OFFER TO CLINTON
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a sign that the upcoming negotiations between
Congress and President Clinton may be rocky, leading Republicans
and Democrats declined Wednesday to endorse an end-of-session
compromise offered by Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert suggested last week to Clinton that a minimum wage
increase sought by the Democrats be paired with a Republican
package of $76 billion in tax relief for businesses and the
self-employed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally commend the speaker for trying to extend an olive
branch to the president and saying, 'Let's work on these things
that we can work on to get them done for the American people,' ``
said Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   But Watts, who chairs the group that includes all Republican
House members, declined to be pinned down on whether he or a
majority of rank-and-file Republicans would vote for Hastert's
plan. So did the other Republicans who flanked him at a news
conference held after a strategy session for two dozen GOP House
members.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting separately with reporters, Senate Democratic Leader Tom
Daschle of South Dakota was also skeptical. He complained that by
restoring the full deduction for business-related meals, the
compromise would ``put the three-martini lunch break back in, and
that's a $30 billion cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Dropping that $30 billion tax break would bring the $76 billion
package closer to ``a cost parameter that I could be more
enthusiastic about,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   Deals on spending levels are more likely than agreement on
taxes, indicated the House GOP strategists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're prepared to meet the president more than halfway in
getting these bills done,'' said Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., who
chairs an appropriations subcommittee. ``But we need to have the
president of the United States tell us how much money he needs to
have in these appropriation bills to satisfy him.''
</P>
<P>
   A meeting to kick off negotiations between the parties is being
planned for next week. Clinton, Daschle and House Minority Leader
Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., will represent the Democrats. Hastert and
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., will lead the GOP team.
</P>
<P>
   Each leader will need rank-and-file support from his own
followers in the negotiations that are expected to follow.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans will be skeptical of any deals struck with
Clinton, said Rep. Jim Greenwood, R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, it was the consensus of most of us in that room that
... what Bill Clinton wants as a legacy is to wrest control of
Congress from Republicans to the Democrats,'' Greenwood told
reporters, ``and therefore we can't expect him to play straight and
fair with the American people.''

&HT;     COURT BACKS AD STANDARDS FOR DENTISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you are a dentist who advertises that your
rates are low, your quality is high and your sterilization methods
are state-of-the-art, the California Dental Association says you
may not be ethical enough to be a member.
</P>
<P>
   The CDA's code, which details advertising practices that the
organization considers false or misleading, prompted an antitrust
challenge by the Federal Trade Commission, which said customers
were being deprived of full competition for price and services. But
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the restrictions
actually helped customers make better-informed choices.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC failed to show that the limits on advertising claims led
to higher prices or reduced competition, or that dentists who
wanted to advertise unspecified low rates or high quality actually
were cheaper or better, said Judge Cynthia Holcomb Hall in the 3-0
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in the record contradicts our intuition that when a
dentist advertises using an empty slogan like `The Best Dentist in
the State,' a reader learns more about that dentist's lack of
modesty than anything else,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   All state dental associations and the American Dental
Association have largely similar advertising rules, and many state
medical societies make comparable attempts to prevent deceptive ads
for doctors, said Peter Sfikas, the CDA's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   CDA membership is not required to practice dentistry, but about
19,000 of California's 26,000 licensed dentists belong. The
organization can expel members who violate its code.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court had agreed with the FTC in 1997 that the CDA's
standards were illegal, but was ordered by the Supreme Court last
year to reconsider the case under a standard that required weighing
the benefits and harms to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The case, the first in the nation to address such rules, is part
of a long-running dispute over professional advertising _ regarded
by its advocates as an infusion of competition into fortress-like
occupational guilds, and by opponents as an attempt to let
modern-day patent-medicine salesmen prey on an unsuspecting public.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled in 1977 that a state could not ban
advertising by lawyers, but left the door open for regulation of
advertising practices.
</P>
<P>
   The CDA's advertising code says a dentist who claims that fees
are low must be able to prove that they are lower than other
dentists' fees. An ad proclaiming price discounts must also state
the amount of a non-discounted fee for each service and other
specifics, the CDA says, a restriction that the FTC said would
virtually rule out across-the-board discounts.
</P>
<P>
   The code also says claims of high quality should usually be
considered misleading because they cannot be proved. The CDA has
dropped its former ban on ads touting ``gentle'' dentistry, but
still frowns on claims that imply a dentist is superior to others,
Sfikas said.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling provides assurance that ``patients and consumers can
rely upon ads by CDA members,'' Sfikas said.

&HT;    COLLEGES BROADEN FRESHMAN ORIENTATION QL
</HEADLINE>
 QL  By KAREN W. ARENSON QC

c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service QC 
<TEXT>
  &QL; QL &QR; 
    NEW YORK - Time was when freshman orientation consisted largely of
campus tours and introductions to the football team and the student
newspaper. But in recent years, college officials have been trying to
squeeze extra mileage out of those early hours on campus when students are
most open to new ideas and experiences, offering them serious social issues
to digest, not just choices of fraternity rushes.
   Last week, for example, after the briefest of welcomes, incoming
students at Baruch College were greeted on their first day with a
discussion of the massacre of nearly 1 million Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994.
Rather than being asked over the summer to pore over lists of dormitories
and teams, the students had been asked to read ``We Wish to Inform You That
Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families: Stories from Rwanda.'' And
Philip Gourevitch, the author of the book, was the freshman convocation's
featured speaker.
   For the 1,350 freshmen at Baruch, a campus of the City University of New
York, this  somber introduction to the world of current events was like a
plunge into an icy lake. It caught their attention.
   While the subject at Baruch was especially sobering, students at other
colleges were also being steeped in the problems of the world. At the
University of Pennsylvania, freshmen attended seminars on topics  from
eating disorders to bribery and corruption. Incoming students at Mount
Holyoke College will be pounding nails with Habitat for Humanity. At
Defiance College in Ohio, freshmen are fanning out to the community to
register voters.
   Barnard College freshmen are cleaning up a local playground and helping
at local charities like the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society and the Gay Men's
Health Crisis. And in one of the more inventive twists on diversity,  the
Barnard freshmen joined  students at Columbia last Wednesday for an evening
of theatrical monologues reflecting  differences in cultural practices
based on essays from some of the freshmen's own college applications. The
monologues reflected the experiences of an Iranian woman growing up in a
traditional home, a Taiwanese student adjusting to the United States, a
secular Jew dining with Orthodox Jews, an Asian woman attending a
predominantly Cuban high school in Florida, and a black man discovering
pride in the color of his skin.
   ``Colleges are looking to recreate common experiences, particularly
intellectual experiences that set an academic tone and raise
expectations,'' said John Gardner, a senior fellow at the National Resource
Center for the First Year Experience at the University of South Carolina.
   Such experiences were common 40 or 50 years ago, he said, when there was
greater homogeneity of students and more commonality in the curriculum, but
eroded in the '60s and '70s. ``Midcentury, it was easier to make
assumptions about a body of knowledge that the students could relate to,''
he said.
   At Baruch, which had not assigned a summer reading before this year,
Myrna Chase, the acting provost and a historian, said she had wanted a book
that would ``make the students think about the world, about ethical
concerns and about their responsibility for each other,'' issues she hoped
the students would keep in mind throughout their college years.
      For nearly an hour last Wednesday, in Baruch's ornate auditorium,
Gourevitch, a slender, dark-haired man of 38, offered the students a kind
of template for learning by relating his own odyssey from his days as a
Cornell freshman in 1979 - when he was excited and anxious ``about all that
seemed possible'' - to his exploration of the horrifying complexities of
Rwanda.
   In words, he took the students with him on the physical journey to
Rwanda - flying for hours on end over the Swiss Alps, across the
Mediterranean Sea and then across the ``vast immensity of the Sahara desert.''
   But he also tried to take them with him on the intellectual pilgrimage
that began with questions about why the Hutu majority had killed   800,000
members of the ruling Tutsi minority, how the killings had been allowed to
occur, and ``what hell was like.''
   He said he kept hearing that the genocide was chaos, but could not
believe it ``because it seemed obvious that it required the opposite of
chaos to achieve such terrible and widespread destruction in such a
concentrated fashion.''
   Over and over again, he seemed to be telling the students that it was
all right not to have all the answers when  starting out, so long as one
looks for ways to find them.
   Pushing students to think critically has become a major theme for
colleges. Like  Gourevitch's quest for answers in east Africa, the
students' passage through college may also seem bewildering at times. In
his preface to his book, before he even gets to the decomposed cadavers and
still-clothed skeletons in a church on a rocky hill in eastern Rwanda,
Gourevitch says: ``This is a book about how people imagine themselves and
one another - a book about how we imagine our world.''

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

   The worlds that Baruch students  come from  are diverse. The college has
admitted nearly 200 foreign students this year, as well as many immigrants
who now call New York City home. There are nine from Africa (none from
Rwanda), and many more from Asia, Eastern Europe and the Caribbean islands.
   Some faculty members and administrators, including the college's new
president, Edward Regan, had feared that genocide in Rwanda might be too
grim a welcome to college life or seem too far removed from the students'
own lives.
   ``When I first heard about the book, I said: `Wait a minute. A lot of
these kids open their front doors and see violence every day,'''  Regan
said last Wednesday.
   But he said he had become convinced that Rwanda was ``a different order
of magnitude'' and was pleased that Gourevitch ``wasn't wagging a finger at
the students and telling them to go out and find out what the world is
about.''
   In small group sessions after the convocation and later that afternoon,
the students expressed mixed reactions to the book. Some had read all 353
pages. Others dipped into a few chapters. All had strong feelings.
   Kevon Logie, a 19-year-old freshman who came to New York from Trinidad
last month, said the tensions between the more economically successful
Tutsis and the less wealthy Hutus in Rwanda reminded him of the tensions
between Indians and blacks in Trinidad.
   ``He said it is not about class lines, but I believe it is,'' said
Logie, referring to  Gourevitch. ``Basically it was a class struggle.''
   Shanaz Gannie, 21, a  junior who was one of the upperclassmen serving as
counselors, said that while the book was a ``weird'' choice for a freshman
summer reading, she thought it was a good one.
   ``You can ask what genocide has to do with me, if you are planning to go
into business,'' said  Gannie, who was born in Guyana. ``But it helps you
know there's another world out there. If you are going into marketing, you
know that there are different kinds of markets.''
    Juliya Chernetsky, 18, said she definitely saw parallels with Russia,
which she left when she was 7.
   ``A lot of things were promised to people if they would turn against
their own people,'' she said, alluding to the Rwandans who killed friends
and neighbors.
   She added, however, that she did not think anything like the genocide in
Rwanda could happen in America.
   But in a small seminar after his lecture,  Gourevitch told students that
they could find parallels in American history, too.
   ``It's useful to think of the early American West,'' he said. ``Think of
the desperado bands. The Indian killers.''
    Baruch officials pronounced themselves well satisfied with the Rwanda
discussion, and said they hoped that students and faculty members would
return to the issues in the months to come.
   David Potash, a history professor and director of academic services in
the provost's office, said  he planned to use the book in his American
history courses in discussions about race.
   ``There is no attempt to make people use the book in their classes,'' he
said. ``But we hope it will come up and be a foundation experience for the
students.''

MOWERS BECOME LEAN, MEAN RACING MACHINES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GAILE ROBINSON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEATHERFORD, Texas _ ``Rocket'' Reece Reeves is the man to see
for racing machines. He is the Enzo Ferrari of stroked crankshafts,
milled heads and custom-forged pistons. He customizes engines. He
turns suburban machines into lean, mean, lawn mower racing
machines.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, lawn mower racing. It may be the fastest growing
sport in ... well, who knows. The spokespeople are flaky and the
racers are downright crazed. ``It's the sport of the new
mow-lennium,'' says Bruce Kaufman, a racer and president of the
United States Lawn Mower Racing Association.
</P>
<P>
   The group is sponsored by Chicago's Gold Eagle Co., manufacturer
of Sta-bil, a fuel additive. Their slogan: ``We turn a chore into a
competitive sport.''
</P>
<P>
   There's the come-on. For every sod warrior who fancies himself
(or herself; there are a few) an Andretti as he corners the mailbox
and zooms down the straightaway past the air conditioner and into
the back yard, there is a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Flash to a lawn-mower racetrack; OK, it's only a hay-bale lined
soccer field, but it has all the sounds of a racetrack. Drivers
line up shoulder to shoulder for the start, they lean into the
tight turns, machines rolling up on two wheels, engines screaming
like monster motorcycles. Mowers spin out of control and crash into
the infield. There, at the finish line, with the checkered flag
madly waving in figure-8s, lengths in front of everyone else, is
the sod warrior pushing his one cylinder engine to the max, 45, 50,
sometimes in excess of 60 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine was clocked at 67 miles per hour at the Texas Motor
Speedway. Now, it'll go 80, but that's not official,'' says the
30-year-old Reeves, who tinkers with Murrays, John Deeres and
Snappers at his shop, Reeves' Mow Better. It's a three-bay space in
an industrial strip mall that has tripled in size since Reeves
opened at the beginning of the year. There are racing machines
filling up one entire garage _ three of them belong to Reeves. One
is a Little Mustang by Huffman, the most coveted lawn-mower racer.
Reeves found it abandoned and rusting in a field outside
Weatherford. He paid $15 for the privilege of digging it out of the
soil that had solidified around it. Reeves is itching to get his
hands on the racers, but on this day, customers keep intervening.
</P>
<P>
   They arrive with lawn mowers that actually cut grass, or don't,
and that's the problem. Instead of aluminum heads, they need a
starter fixed. The woman in the Ford Explorer does not want a
$1,200 titanium rod. She wants her engine to quit smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Lawn Mower Racing is still in its infancy, which is why Reeves
still works with civilians as well as customizing engines for
racers from Australia, Holland and England. The international
circuit is huge. In the United States, the sport is a mere 7 years
old, with 500 registered racers on the Sta-bil circuit. The mow the
merrier, enthuses Kaufman. The 2000 Sta-bil nationals were held
Labor Day weekend outside Indianapolis, on a county fairgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The sport is still in its infancy. There are no big purses, only
trophies and the honor. All the proceeds go to charity. A regular
Joe can participate on a $200 to $300 investment, Reeves says.
``It's a lot less expensive than NASCAR and a hundred times better.
With a car, you can control it. With a lawn mower, you don't know
what it's going to do, go sideways, or what. There is so much more
adrenalin.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves dons his racing gear: a full helmet, flame-retardant
motorcycle pants, a neck brace, a chest protector and heavy boots.
He proudly shows off his three trophies; the 2-foot-tall awards are
about the size you get when you win the company softball
tournament. ``Next year, we'll have to get a big trophy cabinet.''
The vehicle that will help fill that cabinet is Reeves' 1992 Murray
that he bought for $25 at a garage sale.
</P>
<P>
   The mower's blade has been removed, and Reeves has fiddled with
the engine and treated the body to a professional paint job. Every
flat surface bears a decal _ Weatherford Sign Co., Turpin Tire,
Sta-bil. The local sponsorships are not enough to allow Reeves to
travel the circuit with his pit crew: his wife, Shawntel, and two
young sons. ``Although Briggs &AMP; Stratton have been very kind,''
Reeves says.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes that the custom work will someday consume all of his
time; now it is only 30 percent. Racers who have used Reeves'
services think the day may come. ``The people who will succeed in
this business will be able to work frames and metal. They will have
to do chassis as well as engines,'' says Bob Frennesson of Katy,
Texas, one of the Team Texas racers.

   It would help if the sport became big, as in, known. For that to
happen, there will need to be bags of cash at the finish line and
hobbyists with more money than sense, willing to shell out
thousands of dollars for titanium rods that will help them crash
through hay bales at ever greater speeds. Until that day, Reeves is
relegated to fixing starters, and not attending the nationals.
</P>
<P>
   The extreme heat in Texas has kept the grass from growing, which
has kept mowers in the garage and Reeves shy of work. As the sun
blazes across the empty parking lot next door, Reeves is doing
figure 8's at what seems an incredibly dangerous speed. His wife,
left to manage the repair shop, watches, only sightly bemused. When
Reeves became a racer, she became the family lawn mower.

     Before the introduction of gypsum wallboard, interior walls were
finished with plaster. Wallboard is essentially a flat sheet of plaster
sandwiched between sheets of special paper. Unlike plaster, wallboard is
fastened to the studs in a dry state and for this reason it is frequently
called drywall. (It is also sometimes called Sheetrock, but this is a trade
name of the USG Corp. and should only be used in reference to its product.)
   The thickness of wallboard varies from one-fourth to 5/8 of an inch in
1/8-inch increments. The half-inch thickness is best for most uses. Use
the thicker 5/8-inch board in areas where a firewall is required or on
walls to muffle sound transmission. The thinner grades, 3/8 and 1/4-inch,
should only be used for curved wall surfaces or on walls where the new
material will have to match the thickness of a thin adjacent  wall.
   Wallboard is also available with a water-resistant core. This product
should be installed in areas where humidity may be a problem, such as damp
basements. Water-resistant wallboard is not waterproof, however, and should
not be used in  wet areas like showers (where it is best to install cement
backer board with a waterproof membrane).
   The standard width of wallboard panels is 4 feet. Panels vary in length
from 6 feet to 16 feet. The most popular lengths are 8 and 12 feet. The
larger panels cover more area, creating fewer joints to tape, but they are
heavy -   12-foot panels weigh 82 pounds; the 8-foot panels weigh 55 pounds
- and are difficult to maneuver in small rooms.
   You can use drywall nails or screws to secure the panels to the studs,
but  screws are superior fasteners because they do not pop loose like nails
can. Use 1 1/4-inch screws for mounting 1/2-inch-thick wallboard, and 1
5/8-inch  screws for 5/8-inch-thick panels. The ideal tool to use for
driving drywall screws is a drywall screwgun (this can be rented at rental
centers). It is better than a variable speed drill because it has an
adjustable nose that allows you to set the screws at a precise depth and it
operates at low torque  so the screws will not rip into the plaster core.
   To estimate the quantity of material needed, add the total surface area
that you intend to panel. Do not deduct the area of the doors and windows
unless  they are very large. Then divide that number by the total square
feet per sheet. A 4-by-8 panel covers 32 square feet and a 4-by-12 covers
48 square  feet.
   Drywall does not store well, so try to order the exact number of panels
needed. At your work site, stack the panels on edge, making sure they are
evenly supported so they do not bend or warp.
   Before mounting the wallboard, check the condition of the plumbing and
electrical lines in the walls and make any repairs or additions while
everything is still exposed. Next, check the corners where adjacent walls
meet and where the walls and ceiling join. Usually the corner posts and the
top  plates do not extend far enough to provide support for the drywall. It
is best to nail backers made of 2-by-4's to provide mounting surfaces in
these  places.
   If you are finishing an entire room, start by installing the ceiling
panels (called the lids) first, and then work on the walls from the top
down. When the  wall panels are in place they will support the ceiling.
   Lifting drywall panels overhead is hard work. You will need a helper for
this. You can also rent a drywall jack (also called a lift) at rental
outlets  to raise the panels and hold them in place while you secure them
to the joists.
   Whenever possible, try to install complete panels so you will have fewer
joints to tape over. There will be areas where you will have to cut a panel
to  fit. First, mark the length needed on the finish side of the board,
then score across the line with a utility knife. Use a metal straightedge
as a guide.  Stand the wallboard on edge and bend it toward the backside;
this will snap the board at the score line. Once the board breaks, fold it
back to form a right  angle. Cut the backing paper at the fold with the
utility knife.
   Press the panel against the studs and drive the screws, spaced evenly
every 12 inches, through the board into the studs. It is important to drive
the  screws so the heads are slightly depressed below the surface of the
panel yet not so deep the screw breaks through the paper. If you do drive a
screw too  deep, install another about an inch away, then remove the
improperly set screw.

TOADIES FANS WON'T BE HOPPING ON NEW CD THIS YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There it was, just a few weeks ago, on record label Interscope's
schedule of CDs for fall release: a new disc from Fort Worth's
Toadies.
</P>
<P>
   A title was not given; nor was a concrete release date.
Nonetheless, that piece of paper had the Toadies' name etched on
it, promising a new disc.
</P>
<P>
   After five years of scrapping songs, producers, band members and
ideas, the North Texas punk-pop group was finally releasing a
follow-up to its 1994 major-label debut, ``Rubberneck.'' That
surprise first CD spawned a handful of hit singles _ including the
``do-you-wanna-die?'' anthem ``Possum Kingdom'' _ and sold more
than a million copies, making the Toadies the first
alternative-rock success story for Fort Worth. Ever since, fans
have been waiting for a sophomore effort.
</P>
<P>
   But two weeks after the follow-up album was announced, an
updated list was put out _ and it was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know; it's just not on here anymore,'' says Interscope
publicist Terry Wang, scanning the list while on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   To Toadies fans, news of the disc showing up on a release
schedule, and then disappearing, is not the least bit surprising.
At this point, they're used to it.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few years, the record _ initially called
``Feeler,'' now called ``Hell Below, Stars Above'' _ has been
penciled in and erased, recorded, then rerecorded.
</P>
<P>
   As of today, it is tentatively set to come out early in 2001,
well after Interscope's fall shower of high-profile releases, such
as Marilyn Manson's ``Holy Wood'' (''In the Shadow of the Valley of
Death''), U2's ``All That You Can't Leave Behind'' and the
Wallflowers' ``Breach.''
</P>
<P>
   Toadies drummer Mark Reznicek says Interscope's strong fall
lineup is the reason for the latest delay: The label and the band
don't want the record to get lost in a shuffle of priority-one
discs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be competing with records on our own label,''
Reznicek says. ``Everyone thinks the best time for it to come out
will be early next year, when there's not so much other stuff
coming out. It's not like Interscope is delaying it. They wanna put
it out as much as we do. Sure, I wanna put it out as soon as
possible, but I also want it to do as well as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they long ago fell off the national scene, the Toadies
never really dropped out of sight locally. The band plays
occasional shows here and records at Last Beat studios in Dallas.
Tracks from Rubberneck still get airplay on area rock radio
stations such as KEGL/97.1 ``The Eagle'' and 94.5/KDGE ``The
Edge.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, they still have a local presence.
</P>
<P>
   It's their presence nationally _ or lack thereof _ that has some
industry watchers worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will always care locally. They're huge here,'' says
Duane Doherty, program director for The Edge. ``But it's been so
long since `Possum Kingdom' came out, I don't know if people will
remember them nationally. So many bands come and go, it's hard to
say if they'll remember this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Grubbs, an evening DJ at 88.7/KTCU ``The Choice'' _ the
Texas Christian University station credited with ``discovering''
the Toadies locally during the early '90s _ thinks they will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that band is more than just a local cult act now,''
Grubbs says. ``They've got a major national following. I'd say
their new record is as big a deal as Weezer's new one, in terms of
anticipation.''
</P>
<P>
   Grubbs adds that ``the Internet buzz is very big'' on a new
Toadies song that's floating around in cyberspace and also
available on a sampler CD that was passed out to fans at the recent
Vans Warped Tour in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The track, ``Heel,'' has wound up on a handful of Texas radio
stations, The Edge included.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's proof that people still care,'' Grubbs says of the
airplay the song has received. ``That record has been so
long-awaited, when it finally comes out, there will be people
lining up to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the only thing fans are lining up to do is ask the
Toadies what has taken the band so long to release a new disc.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are numerous.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Rubberneck'' took off in 1995, the band went through a
membership shuffle: Guitarist Darrel Herbert, who co-wrote three
``Rubberneck'' tracks, left; Clark Vogeler, a former member of
another North Texas rock group, Funland, took his spot and had to
be broken in. Herbert's departure was the first in a series of
setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   After tours with Bush and the B_hole Surfers, among others, the
band _ Reznicek, Vogeler, singer Todd Lewis and bassist Lisa
Umbarger _ recorded a batch of songs with B_hole Surfers member
Paul Leary producing. At the end of the sessions, neither the band
nor the label, Reznicek says, was too thrilled with the songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The label and us just didn't like the way they turned out,''
Reznicek says. ``They sounded computerized and processed. They
didn't have that live sound that we like. But chances are, we'll
release some of that stuff in one form or another, someday.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of that material, Umbarger said, was shelved. New songs
were written, and to tweak them, the group turned to the team
responsible for producing and engineering ``Rubberneck:'' Tom
Rothrock and Rob Schnapf. Andy Wallace was brought back in to
reprise his ``Rubberneck'' role as mixer.
</P>
<P>
   Writing new songs and scrambling to rehire and get comfortable
working again with the three studio whizzes came on the heels of a
long down period for the band, brought on by a record-company
merger that resulted in layoffs and band axings.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Toadies sold more than a million copies of
``Rubberneck'' _ ensuring them a home at Interscope during the
merger _ funds were temporarily frozen, keeping them from making
progress on the new disc.
</P>
<P>
   After the merger blew over, the band resumed recording,
eventually coming home with ``Hell Below, Stars Above.''
</P>
<P>
   But again, they must wait, this time until Interscope has
released efforts from Limp Bizkit, U2 and the Wallflowers _ sure
things that will sell well during the music-industry's cutthroat
Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
   All this waiting has left the band members strapped for cash,
hence a string of Texas shows over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had to take day jobs, but we've come pretty
close,'' Reznicek says. ``People ask that all the time. That, and
they ask, `Where's the record?' That's been the question for years.
I just say, `It's a long story.' ''

   You can smell it in the air: sweat, hot dogs and more sweat.
</P>
<P>
   It's outdoor professional sports season. Has been for a while.
And it'll rage on for a few months, causing traffic jams around The
Ballpark in Arlington, fistfights in the parking lot of Texas
Stadium and a rash of yawning wherever our soccer team does its
thing.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative: Stay at home and simulate the lovely nuances of
outdoor sporting events with these three games:
</P>
<P>
   Sydney 2000 (Eidos for Sony PlayStation): Man, is there a
sporting event that vidgame companies haven't gotten their hands on
yet? How 'bout that chuck-wagon championship in Iowa?
</P>
<P>
   This new arrival is, obviously, self-explanatory: It's based on
the upcoming Olympic tournaments in Sydney, Australia, and features
a dozen events. Players compete with the computer or against one
another in events such as high jump, javelin throw, skeet shooting,
cycling, kayaking and swimming.
</P>
<P>
   Before the events begin, players can train their characters in
the virtual gym, which is about the only working out that I've ever
done.
</P>
<P>
   The graphics are OK, but you can tell Sony and its third-party
game makers are cutting corners and costs, probably to gear up and
save up for this fall's PlayStation 2 arrival. The graphics are a
little boxy and the response time is slightly slow, so proceed with
caution.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Tennis (Nintendo for Nintendo 64): This is more about
having a good, goofy time than playing a good game of tennis. If
you want the latter, Sega Dreamcast's Virtua Tennis is where it's
at. Mario Tennis will only frustrate you.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the army of Mario games will undoubtedly love this,
though. You can choose your fave Mario characters for rounds of
singles and doubles. There are also some cool minigames and special
effects, such as a tilting court. Fun stuff, but don't expect any
more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry McGrath Supercross 2000 (Acclaim for Sega Dreamcast): This
was lame for PlayStation, and it hasn't improved a bit for
Dreamcast. Yet another motorcross racing game with absolutely no
personality or distinguishing characteristics, Supercross 2K is
simply a retread of Excitebike and all the others that have come
before: Choose your ride, choose your track, race, spill, cross the
finish line. Repeat until boredom sets in. Which is gonna be pretty
fast. &QL;

COLLEGES BROADEN FRESHMAN ORIENTATION
</HEADLINE>
  By KAREN W. ARENSON 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK - Time was when freshman orientation consisted largely
of campus tours and introductions to the football team and the
student newspaper. But in recent years, college officials have been
trying to squeeze extra mileage out of those early hours on campus
when students are most open to new ideas and experiences, offering
them serious social issues to digest, not just choices of
fraternity rushes.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for example, after the briefest of welcomes, incoming
students at Baruch College were greeted on their first day with a
discussion of the massacre of nearly 1 million Tutsis in Rwanda in
1994. Rather than being asked over the summer to pore over lists of
dormitories and teams, the students had been asked to read ``We
Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our
Families: Stories from Rwanda.'' And Philip Gourevitch, the author
of the book, was the freshman convocation's featured speaker.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1,350 freshmen at Baruch, a campus of the City
University of New York, this somber introduction to the world of
current events was like a plunge into an icy lake. It caught their
attention.
</P>
<P>
   While the subject at Baruch was especially sobering, students at
other colleges were also being steeped in the problems of the
world. At the University of Pennsylvania, freshmen attended
seminars on topics from eating disorders to bribery and corruption.
Incoming students at Mount Holyoke College will be pounding nails
with Habitat for Humanity. At Defiance College in Ohio, freshmen
are fanning out to the community to register voters.
</P>
<P>
   Barnard College freshmen are cleaning up a local playground and
helping at local charities like the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society
and the Gay Men's Health Crisis. And in one of the more inventive
twists on diversity, the Barnard freshmen joined students at
Columbia last Wednesday for an evening of theatrical monologues
reflecting differences in cultural practices based on essays from
some of the freshmen's own college applications. The monologues
reflected the experiences of an Iranian woman growing up in a
traditional home, a Taiwanese student adjusting to the United
States, a secular Jew dining with Orthodox Jews, an Asian woman
attending a predominantly Cuban high school in Florida, and a black
man discovering pride in the color of his skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colleges are looking to recreate common experiences,
particularly intellectual experiences that set an academic tone and
raise expectations,'' said John Gardner, a senior fellow at the
National Resource Center for the First Year Experience at the
University of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Such experiences were common 40 or 50 years ago, he said, when
there was greater homogeneity of students and more commonality in
the curriculum, but eroded in the '60s and '70s. ``Midcentury, it
was easier to make assumptions about a body of knowledge that the
students could relate to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Baruch, which had not assigned a summer reading before this
year, Myrna Chase, the acting provost and a historian, said she had
wanted a book that would ``make the students think about the world,
about ethical concerns and about their responsibility for each
other,'' issues she hoped the students would keep in mind
throughout their college years.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly an hour last Wednesday, in Baruch's ornate
auditorium, Gourevitch, a slender, dark-haired man of 38, offered
the students a kind of template for learning by relating his own
odyssey from his days as a Cornell freshman in 1979 - when he was
excited and anxious ``about all that seemed possible'' - to his
exploration of the horrifying complexities of Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   In words, he took the students with him on the physical journey
to Rwanda - flying for hours on end over the Swiss Alps, across the
Mediterranean Sea and then across the ``vast immensity of the
Sahara desert.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also tried to take them with him on the intellectual
pilgrimage that began with questions about why the Hutu majority
had killed 800,000 members of the ruling Tutsi minority, how the
killings had been allowed to occur, and ``what hell was like.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he kept hearing that the genocide was chaos, but could
not believe it ``because it seemed obvious that it required the
opposite of chaos to achieve such terrible and widespread
destruction in such a concentrated fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Over and over again, he seemed to be telling the students that
it was all right not to have all the answers when starting out, so
long as one looks for ways to find them.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing students to think critically has become a major theme
for colleges. Like Gourevitch's quest for answers in east Africa,
the students' passage through college may also seem bewildering at
times. In his preface to his book, before he even gets to the
decomposed cadavers and still-clothed skeletons in a church on a
rocky hill in eastern Rwanda, Gourevitch says: ``This is a book
about how people imagine themselves and one another - a book about
how we imagine our world.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The worlds that Baruch students come from are diverse. The
college has admitted nearly 200 foreign students this year, as well
as many immigrants who now call New York City home. There are nine
from Africa (none from Rwanda), and many more from Asia, Eastern
Europe and the Caribbean islands.
</P>
<P>
   Some faculty members and administrators, including the college's
new president, Edward Regan, had feared that genocide in Rwanda
might be too grim a welcome to college life or seem too far removed
from the students' own lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard about the book, I said: `Wait a minute. A
lot of these kids open their front doors and see violence every
day,''' Regan said last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he had become convinced that Rwanda was ``a
different order of magnitude'' and was pleased that Gourevitch
``wasn't wagging a finger at the students and telling them to go
out and find out what the world is about.''
</P>
<P>
   In small group sessions after the convocation and later that
afternoon, the students expressed mixed reactions to the book. Some
had read all 353 pages. Others dipped into a few chapters. All had
strong feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Kevon Logie, a 19-year-old freshman who came to New York from
Trinidad last month, said the tensions between the more
economically successful Tutsis and the less wealthy Hutus in Rwanda
reminded him of the tensions between Indians and blacks in
Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it is not about class lines, but I believe it is,''
said Logie, referring to Gourevitch. ``Basically it was a class
struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanaz Gannie, 21, a junior who was one of the upperclassmen
serving as counselors, said that while the book was a ``weird''
choice for a freshman summer reading, she thought it was a good
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can ask what genocide has to do with me, if you are
planning to go into business,'' said Gannie, who was born in
Guyana. ``But it helps you know there's another world out there. If
you are going into marketing, you know that there are different
kinds of markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Juliya Chernetsky, 18, said she definitely saw parallels with
Russia, which she left when she was 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things were promised to people if they would turn
against their own people,'' she said, alluding to the Rwandans who
killed friends and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   She added, however, that she did not think anything like the
genocide in Rwanda could happen in America.
</P>
<P>
   But in a small seminar after his lecture, Gourevitch told
students that they could find parallels in American history, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's useful to think of the early American West,'' he said.
``Think of the desperado bands. The Indian killers.''
</P>
<P>
   Baruch officials pronounced themselves well satisfied with the
Rwanda discussion, and said they hoped that students and faculty
members would return to the issues in the months to come.
</P>
<P>
   David Potash, a history professor and director of academic
services in the provost's office, said he planned to use the book
in his American history courses in discussions about race.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no attempt to make people use the book in their
classes,'' he said. ``But we hope it will come up and be a
foundation experience for the students.''

     Who knew that so many grandfathers went by the name Poppop?

      Robert Sullivan found out. A grandfather of eight who lives in
Summerville, S.C.,  Sullivan uses the name Poppop(at)aol.com as his e-mail
address. He gets about five e-mail messages a day for the wrong Poppop.

     Sullivan suspects that many of the missives are meant for variations
of Poppop - Poppops burdened with additional numbers or initials - owned by
people who were too late to claim the pure, unadulterated version that he
registered  in 1992.

    A good screen name is hard to find, and getting harder. AOL has 23
million members and allows seven names for each account. So theoretically,
154 million names have already been taken, although AOL said the average
was 2.1 screen names per account.

    People looking for new names are frustrated. Some switch e-mail
services, try other spellings, add numbers or finally just settle on a less
appealing name.

   ``I must have tried a million combinations of my name,'' said John Noh,
who works in public relations in Silicon Valley. ``You wouldn't believe how
many JNohs or JohnNs or JohnNohs there are in the AOL database.

    ``Each abbreviation I tried had to be accompanied by some number,''
said   Noh, who used to think that his Korean last name was not very
common. ``I got so fed up I said, `I'll put my own number in there.'''

     Noh claimed noh666(at)aol.com.

   ``I had such a devilish time trying to get a screen name,'' he said,
``maybe I chose it subconsciously.''

    But the screen name became a problem when he began looking for a job.

   ``I felt stupid sending it out,''  Noh said. ``It was a conversation
piece among my friends, but in a professional setting I realized how
inappropriate it was.''  He was relieved to get jnoh(at)excite.com.

    Screen names are now an important part of people's identities, said
Steve Jones, a communication professor at the University of Illinois in
Chicago who studies online social relations.  People's screen names are
often meaningful to them, even if they are inscrutable to others.

    When someone asks for a screen name that is already taken, e-mail
services often suggest adding a number. That can be a problem. Even numbers
that mean something to the user - a  street address, a ZIP code, a birth
date, a lucky number - seem random and hard for others to remember. That is
why people prefer sequences, like 1234, or patterns, like 8888, Jones said.

      The earliest AOL users were able to get ordinary screen names.
``Having anything normal-sounding on AOL is a gold star of the early
adoptive personality,'' said Rachel Pine, a former AOL user in New York.

      Last fall,  Pine planned a party that was supposed to have Curious
George as the host. She wanted to register ``curiousgeorge'' as a screen
name where people  could send RSVPs. She tried  CuriousGeorge(at)yahoo,
then CGeorge,  CuriousG, CuryosGeorge and even YellowHat -  a ``desperation
move,'' she said.  All were taken.

     So she went elsewhere. RachelPine(at)yahoo.com was also taken, but she
got Rachel(underscore)Pine(at)yahoo and decided that she liked the
underscore. ``My name is not RachelPine all one word,'' she said. She also
claimed  her name - underscore included - on several free e-mail services,
fearing that the chance would never come again.

   Many people have different screen names for business and personal  use.
For e-mail messages at work, people often have their names or variations of
them, sometimes in  standard formats required by their offices. Personal
e-mail messages tend to operate according to what Jones calls the concert
T-shirt effect: People choose the name of something they like, whether it
is a band, song, sports team, celebrity or fairy tale character. People
also choose names that help them adopt different personalities or sexes  in
chat rooms, for dating services and on message boards, ``just as
adolescents might choose to have a nickname or choose how to dress,'' Jones
said. ``Because we have a high degree of anonymity on e-mail,'' he added,
``the screen name is the only thing  that distinguishes us.''

       Unlike domain names,  screen names can be used by more than one
person as long as the suffix is different. That was one of the ideas behind
Mail.com,  which lets each user pick the first two parts of each e-mail
address, not just the first part. Mail.com has about 17 million addresses
in use.

       ``We recognized that if you went to AOL or Hotmail or Yahoo,
millions of people had already picked the main address,'' said Gerald
Gorman, Mail.com's chairman and chief executive.

       Mail.com circumvents the problem by offering about 100 choices for
the second part of the e-mail address. It also permits the use of various
keyboard characters like ampersands, asterisks and dollar signs. They might
be cumbersome to say aloud, but at least that allows many versions of the
same name, from common&AMP;name(at)writeme.com to
common(star)name(at)cheerful.com to common$name(at)london.com.

       People especially like professional suffixes -  (at)deliveryman.com,
(at)doctor.com, (at)priest.com -  as part of their e-mail addresses on
their business cards,  Gorman said.

       AOL, which allows only letters, numbers and spaces, responded to the
demand for more names by expanding the number of characters allowed per
name to to 16 from 10, said a spokeswoman, Tricia Primrose. One advantage
is that more people can fit in their full names. People sometimes fill
their seven AOL slots by registering names for their children, or even for
their unborn babies. ``It's never too early,''  Primrose said.

        But it is often too late. When people drop AOL, their screen names
remain out of circulation for a minimum of six months, and often for far
longer. ``We don't want to recycle too quickly,''  Primrose said, ``the
danger being that too much wrong mail will get to the former user.''

   t can also be difficult to get a first choice for a name  on sites
requiring registration.

   Brenda Nashawaty, a frequent online shopper from Boston, was surprised
to find that even her unusual last name, which is Middle Eastern, did not
help.

   ``The Nashawatys must be an online bunch,'' Nashawaty said. On shopping
sites, her name is inevitably taken as either a log-in name or a password.

       ``I've used my cat's name, MishMosh, my perfume, Vanille, and my
car,  GrayCamry,'' she said. ``I'm reduced to looking around my office for
names I'd  remember.''

      Of course, names that are too catchy end up with the Poppop problem.
Names that are too common can be undesirable because they get so much junk
mail,  said John Levine, one of the authors of ``E-Mail for Dummies'' (IDG
Books Worldwide, 1997).

       Many AOL members will not accept e-mail messages from just any
sender, and their AOL profiles explain why. Mike(at)aol.com wrote in his
profile: ``You probably have me confused with some other person named Mike.
His screen name is not Mike. If he has sent you e-mail, check the  From
line to obtain the correct screen name.''

       In his profile, Tony(at)aol.com was more irritated. ``No I am not
the Tony you are looking for,'' he wrote, ``so before you IM me out of pure
ignorance with something like, `How was your day at work,' or, `Hey, Tony,
how's your wife?' think for a minute about how many people use AOL and how
many are potentially named Tony.''

        Sullivan confirmed that such errant correspondence was both boring
and  bothersome. ``The messages say things like: `Thank you for the book,'
`See you at Easter,' `We had fun on vacation,''' said  Sullivan, who used
to reply with a polite note and a suggestion for finding the right Poppop.
He now  answers with a terse, ``Wrong Poppop!''

       One instant message encounter turned into an almost hourlong
computer confrontation that became ``kind of heated,''  Sullivan said.

       ``This was an older gentleman like myself,  and he didn't know much
about computers,''  Sullivan said. ``He said I had put my name on his IM
list and it was costing him money and he was going to report me to AOL.
Evidently he had a friend he called Poppop. I said, `This is my e-mail
address,  no matter what your friend's name is.' He didn't understand that.''

 &HT;    GORE OFFERS MASSIVE ECONOMIC PLAN
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore offered up a voluminous and detailed spending plan for
the nation Wednesday in Cleveland, promising to create 10 million
high-tech jobs, send poverty to historic lows and boost family
income by one-third. Gore also said he would erase the national
debt and strengthen the finances of Social Security and Medicare.
Senior aides said by focusing on reducing the national debt, Gore's
191-page plan, ``Prosperity for America's Families,'' casts him as
the fiscal conservative in his fight with George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH TELLS VETS MILITARY DETERIORATING
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush appeared at the American Legion convention in
Milwaukee Wednesday and accused Al Gore of letting military
readiness slide. Bush got a boost from the national commander of
the veterans organization, Alan Lance Sr., who blasted Gore for
skipping the group's convention and offering to send his running
mate, Joe Lieberman, in his place. The Legion ``deserves to hear
directly from the man himself, a man who would be our commander in
chief,'' Lance said. The Gore campaign said the event conflicted
with the vice president's speech on economics, and said Bush's
criticism of military readiness carried no credibility.
</P>
<P>
   DIGGING IN DEEPER ON DEBATES
</P>
<P>
   The argument between Al Gore and George W. Bush over debates has
become part of a new Bush campaign ad. The spot says Gore promised
to debate anytime, anywhere _ but now insists that debates be
sponsored by a non-partisan commission. Bush told reporters he'll
stick to his plan to show up for a first debate with Gore in
Washington next Tuesday, even though NBC, the host network, said it
won't air the event without Gore. Said Gore: ``I'm not going to
play games to try to substitute a talk show for the national
bipartisan commission debates.''
</P>
<P>
   GORE OVERTAKES BUSH IN MISSOURI
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has caught George W. Bush in Missouri after trailing
much of the year, according to a new poll published in the Kansas
City Star. Gore led 45-41 percent, jumping from an 11-point deficit
in early July. The Mason-Dixon poll had a 4 percentage point margin
of error, making it a statistical tie. Green Party nominee Ralph
Nader had 2 percent, while Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan was
at 1 percent. Gore made the most progress in Missouri among women,
who now back him by 53-35 percent. In July, Bush led among women
44-41 percent. Bush led by 10 points among men, although the spread
has decreased from 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   SENATE BATTLE SET IN FLORIDA
</P>
<P>
   Two candidates hoping to become Florida's next senator glided
through primaries. Democrat Bill Nelson, the state insurance
commissioner, and Republican Rep. Bill McCollum easily won their
parties' nominations to fill retiring Republican Sen. Connie Mack's
seat, setting up a competitive race in the fall with national
importance. McCollum, who served as a floor manager in President
Clinton's impeachment hearing, took 82 percent of the 800,000
Republican votes, while Nelson won 77 percent of the 850,000
Democratic votes.
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI-DADE MAYOR WINS RE-ELECTION
</P>
<P>
   In another Florida race, Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas won a
second term after months of tumult over the Elian Gonzalez case.
Penelas outpaced nine other candidates after being widely accused
of pandering to Cuban-Americans for vowing to deny police
assistance for Elian's removal. Needing more than 50 percent of the
vote to avoid a runoff, Penelas got 51.6 percent to county
Commissioner Miguel Diaz de la Portilla's 20.9 percent. Businessman
Jay Love was third with 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   SENATE FACE-OFF SET IN NEVADA
</P>
<P>
   John Ensign, a veterinarian and former congressman, swiftly won
the Republican primary for an open Senate seat in Nevada. Final
results showed Ensign trouncing his closest opponent by a nearly
20-to-1 margin. In November, Ensign faces millionaire Democratic
lawyer Ed Bernstein, who ran unopposed. Republican leaders consider
Nevada one of their best chances nationally to turn a formerly
Democratic seat their way. Democratic Sen. Richard Bryan decided to
retire after two terms.
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY CLINTON GETS ENVIRONMENTALISTS' BACKING
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton won the endorsement of the Sierra Club, one of
the nation's oldest environmental groups, whose backing set off a
duel between the Senate candidates over who has done more to
protect natural resources. Sierra officials said Rep. Rick Lazio,
the Republican candidate, offered inconsistent support for
environmental matters in his eight-year tenure in Congress. And
members of the group said in an interview with the New York Times
that Lazio did not demonstrate a firm grasp of the environmental
issues the group studies. By contrast, said Rhea Jezer, head of the
club's New York chapter, Clinton ``showed an unequaled depth of
knowledge on a plethora of state and national issues.''
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS FUND-RAISER BACK ON NEW YORK SCENE
</P>
<P>
   When John McCain lost the New York Republican primary last
spring, he put a large part of the blame on what he asserted was an
illegal $2.5 million ad campaign that attacked his environmental
record financed by two wealthy Texas brothers with close ties to
George W. Bush. One of those two brothers, Charles Wyly, has
resurfaced on the New York political scene. This time, he's allied
with Rick Lazio, whom McCain is supporting energetically against
Hillary Clinton. Wyly is a sponsor of one of three out-of-state
fund-raisers Lazio attended Wednesday. Wyly is one of nine
signatories to a letter asking Texans to attend a fund-raiser in
Dallas. ``Many people believe that Mrs. Clinton is the driving
force behind some of the most radical ideas put forth by the
Clinton administration,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   LONG-AGO ADVICE ON DEBATING
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney, as chief of staff to President Ford, helped craft a
battle plan to defeat Jimmy Carter that questioned whether he was
ready for the White House. Challenge him to debates, then try to
get him to come across as ``fuzzy and indecisive'' on issues such
as domestic affairs, the economy, national defense and foreign
policy, Cheney advised. The strategies were captured in a post-1976
election essay Cheney wrote that is on file at Ford's presidential
library in Ann Arbor, Mich. ``We did not believe his `trust me'
approach would be very effective in a debate setting when he was
asked for specific views on major national issues,'' Cheney wrote
of Carter. Carter won that election.
</P>
<P>
   AD HITS BUSH ON CHILD HEALTH CARE
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee will begin running a new TV
spot today that takes a critical look at Texas Gov. George W.
Bush's record of providing health care for children in Texas. The
30-second ad is to run in nine states: Arkansas, Delaware,
Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Washington and
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   CHENEY DEFENDS HIS CHARITABLE GIVING
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney defended his charitable contributions as
``appropriate'' and insisted he should be given credit not only for
direct contributions, but for speaking fees he directed to charity
and for corporate gifts that matched his own donations. Cheney
challenged the suggestion that his generosity should be measured by
comparing his direct contributions of $209,832 over the past 10
years to his income of $20,677,742, a standard by which he gave
1.01 percent of his income. He also counted $89,500 in speaking
fees and $142,820 in matching grants from corporations on whose
boards he and his wife, Lynne, sit. Bush and Cheney have been
urging support of faith-based organizations and charities that
provide services to cure social problems and help poor people.
</P>
<P>
   COMPLAINT HITS LIEBERMAN'S SENATE CANDIDACY
</P>
<P>
   A politics professor asked the Connecticut Elections Enforcement
Commission to declare Joe Lieberman's Senate campaign ``frivolous''
and order him off the state ballot. Lieberman, the Democratic
nominee for vice president, already had announced his intention to
run for re-election when Al Gore selected him as a running mate.
Lieberman has since said he will continue both campaigns _ a
decision criticized by both Republicans and Democrats. State law
permits him to conduct the dual campaigns. But John Orman of
Fairfield University contends in his complaint that Lieberman's
candidacy is illegal, because he would not serve in the Senate if
elected to both offices and because the dual candidacies give
Lieberman an unfair fund-raising advantage.
</P>
<P>
   SUIT SEEKS BUCHANAN RECOGNITION AS NOMINEE
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for a faction of the Reform Party loyal to Pat Buchanan
asked a California state court to declare him the party's true
presidential nominee. Their rivals in the fractured party are
planning their own lawsuit seeking a legal judgment backing up
their contention that John Hagelin is the nominee. At stake is
$12.6 million in federal subsidies for the winning side. The action
came a week after a federal judge in Lynchburg, Va., refused to
referee the party's bitter split, saying he lacked the jurisdiction
to do so. Dale Cooter, an attorney for the Buchanan contingent,
filed the claim in Superior Court in Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   SHE CAN SEE IT CLEARLY NOW
</P>
<P>
   If psychic Dee Dee Smith is to be believed, Democratic vice
presidential candidate Joe Lieberman can stop campaigning. He and
Al Gore have already won. ``I predict Gore will do very well. He'll
win Illinois and I do see him in the White House,'' said Smith, a
63 year-old prognosticator, of the Democratic ticket's chances.
Smith was at the coffeehouse where Lieberman held a round-table
discussion on middle-class tax cuts with local families. She went
in for breakfast and stayed for the talk. Smith said her
predictions are usually about 85 percent accurate.
</P>
<P>
   MAKING FEELINGS KNOWN IN FRANCE
</P>
<P>
   American film director Robert Altman, in France to promote a
movie, said that should George W. Bush win in November, he's
fleeing the U.S.A. Altman, quoted by Reuters at a film festival:
``If George Bush is elected president, I'm leaving for France.''
More Altman: ``I don't think show business personalities should get
involved publicly and show their feelings, because that ends up
working against them. That's why I stay discreet about these
questions in America but, no matter what, it would be a catastrophe
for the whole world if George Bush is elected.''

   U.N.-CLINTON (United Nations) - President Clinton on Wednesday told the
largest gathering of world leaders in history that the United Nations must
reconfigure itself to deal with a world in which there are ``fewer wars
between nations, but more wars within them.'' With the energy of a man who
sees his moment on the world stage quickly slipping away, he immediately
used the Millennium Summit meeting here to take a last stab at many of the
issues that have defied resolution during his presidency. He tried to fend
off a proposal from Russian president Vladimir Putin that would lead to a
demilitarization of outer space - an effort by Putin to put an end to
American talk of a national missile defense - and met with the Palestinian
leader, Yasser Arafat, and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in one last
effort to rescue the Middle East peace process. By David E. Sanger.



   U.N.-MILLENNIUM-SUMMIT (United Nations) - The question hangs out there.
Why would 152 leaders leave their not-always-stable governments unattended
to come to New York and make five-minute speeches, mostly to each other and
the television cameras from back home? Secretary General Kofi Annan had an
answer today as he lifted his glass to the biggest power lunch in history.
``You,'' he said, looking out over the world's political elite, ``have the
ability to transform the lives of 6 billion people.'' By Barbara Crossette.



   WTIMOR-U.N.-KILLINGS (United Nations) - An armed mob ran amok through a
U.N. refugee office in West Timor on Wednesday, beating to death three
unarmed U.N. workers, including an American, and touching off repercussions
of outrage halfway around the world at the Millenium Summit meeting of
world leaders here. By Christoher S. Wren.



   NATIONAL GENERAL

   (Will move in ``a'' news file.)



   NY-MAFIA-ARRESTS (New York) - The Manhattan district attorney Wednesday
charged 38 union officials, contractors and reputed mobsters with bribery,
bid-rigging or other racketeering schemes that siphoned millions of dollars
from public and private building projects throughout the city over the last
two years. By William K. Rashbaum.



   NY-BELGIUM-ROYALS (New York) - The royals are coming. No, no, not the
poor old British Crown Prince, still overshadowed by the tragic legacy of
Diana, Princess of Wales. Nor any of his relatives, like that fellow who
flies the helicopter and his former lady who does the weight-loss thing.
No, New York is getting the other ones, the fabulously cool new royals:
handsome Crown Prince Philippe of Belgium and his ravishing Princess
Mathilde, the fairy-tale couple that has monopolized magazine covers and
glossy photo spreads throughout Europe. Their mission is nothing less than
to take New York City by storm, winning hearts, minds, media and, more
importantly, market share. By Glenn Collins.



   DNA-CONVICTION (Richmond, Va.) - Six years after DNA testing raised
strong doubts about his guilt in a rape and homicide conviction, Earl
Washington Jr., a model prisoner with the IQ of a 10-year-old, awaited the
results of a more definitive test today as his lawyers filed a petition for
a full executive pardon after 17 years in prison. His lawyers, pioneers in
the increasingly successful DNA challenges of criminal convictions,
describe Washington as their long suffering poster child, an amiable,
passive farm hand with an IQ of 69 whose habit is to cooperatively agree
with people. They maintain his case is a summary of the main problems
prompting the rising national concern about capital convictions: race,
mental incapacity, convictions based solely on confession, appeal
limitations, and the inevitable pressures of politics. By Francis X. Clines.



   POLITICS

   (Will move in ``p'' news file.)



   GORE-ECON (Dateline to kum) - In a cadence mimicking former President
Bush's ``read my lips,'' Al Gore reached Wednesday for the mantle of fiscal
conservative, asking voters to ``read my plan'' in a hefty budget book
coupling balanced budgets and ambitious economic goals. (Summary from
wires) By Katharine Q. Seelye.



   GORE-ECON-ASSESS (Washington) - The economic policy blueprint released
Wednesday by Vice President Al Gore is an attempt to spell out for voters,
with considerable specificity, how Gore would seek to harness continued
prosperity on their behalf. A news analysis by Richard W. Stevenson.



   FINANCIAL

   (Will move in ``f'' news file.)



   TIRE-RECALL (Washington) - Faced with growing evidence that
Bridgestone/Firestone and possibly the Ford Motor Co. knew about tire
problems for years and did nothing, Republican and Democratic members of
Congress began hearings on the issue Wednesday by calling for more money
for safety regulators and stiffer penalties for violators. By Keith
Bradsher and Matthew L. Wald.



   CITIGROUP-ASSOCIATES (New York) - Continuing its campaign to become the
dominant financial services provider around the globe, Citigroup said
Wednesday that it would buy the Associates First Capital Corp., the biggest
American consumer-finance company, for about $31.1 billion in stock. The
acquisition, Citigroup's largest since its controversial formation in 1998,
would give Citigroup a significant position in consumer lending in Japan
and a few other countries. It also would improve Citigroup's standing in
the credit card and commercial leasing businesses. By Patrick McGeehan.



   SEAGRAMS-MP3-MUSIC (New York) - In a victory for old line music
companies over an online music start-up, a federal judge ruled on Wednesday
that MP3.com willfully violated copyrights  and awarded Universal Music
Group $25,000 per CD, a penalty that could reach as much as $250 million.
Judge Jed S. Rakoff of U.S. District Court in Manhattan said some Internet
companies ``may have a misconception that, because their technology is
somewhat novel, they are somehow immune from the ordinary applications of
laws of the United States, including copyright law.'' By Amy Harmon.



   SCIENCE

   (Will move in ``a'' news file.)



   SCI-INDIANS-CANNIBALS (Undated) - Scientists have found what they say is
the first direct evidence of cannibalism among prehistoric Indians in the
American Southwest, belying the image of these people as steadfastly
peaceful farmers and perhaps reigniting controversy over whether ancestral
Indians ever made a practice of eating human flesh. By John Noble Wilford.

&HT;    TEMPTATION, IN SPIKE HEELS AND A DEVILISH PRICE TAG QL

    &QL; QL &QR; 
  Here is how I am used to shopping on the Internet. I arrive at an online
store that reminds me of a file cabinet, with all the merchandise tucked
away in tabbed folders. I click on the appropriate folder. Inside I find a
brochure for each item, with a short  description, a price and sometimes a
simple image to confirm that yes, this is the specific thing I have been
trying to track down.
   Here is how I shopped online last week. I walked down a narrow, hidden
alleyway, following a yellow butterfly as it flew past shuttered
townhouses. Then, as if I were wandering around in a version of Myst
optimized for shoe addicts, I peered through the window of a discreet door
set in the middle of a mysterious brick wall and caught a glimpse of
beautiful, spiky-heeled footwear displayed on simple metal perches.
   Beyond the door lay the Manolo Blahnik boutique that neimanmarcus.com
started last month to sell really (really) expensive shoes, using
technology that compresses and streams computer-generated video content at
a rate that enables even shoppers who connect over pokey dial-up modems to
feel as if they are browsing in the ladies' department of the Matrix.
   The technology comes from RichFX, a company headquartered in New York
that also licenses its technology to the jewelry Web site Kirabo.com and
will announce more partnerships in the next few months, company officials
said. The software creates an immersive setting that appears  in a single
window - no annoying pop-up boxes to clutter the screen - and is as
compelling as a video game.
   ``The idea is to turn the Internet into a place that you can move around
in, a place that feels real,'' said Tal Kerret, RichFX's chief executive.
``If you come in at different times of day or night, you get a different
experience, for example. The lighting in the store will be completely
different.''
    Plenty of other technologies have offered similar promises, of course.
``Other three-dimensional environments exist, but they don't download and
stream on demand to deliver what you want when you want, and others didn't
create a formula for such an elegant user interface, either,'' said Peter
Ausnit, an equity analyst at Deutsche Banc Alex Brown in San Francisco.
       All I had to do to visit the shoe boutique, for instance, was to
click on Introducing Blahnik on the neimanmarcus.com home page
(www.neimanmarcus.com) and then download (it took a few seconds) an update
to the Real Networks Real Player already installed on my computer. (The
update includes the RichFX Player). To navigate, all I had to do was click
on Right, Left or Pause. The site also has a zoom feature, which loads
speedily.
    Still, when the yellow butterfly paused at the boutique's doorway, so
did I. Don't go in, I told myself: It's a trick. This is not just some
harmless computer game where I can pump my enemies full of bullets and
splatter their kidneys against the wall. No, this  technology  may have a
harmful impact on my behavior. No one needs $500 shoes, especially not me,
a person who works at home in shorts. Where would I wear them, to the next
meeting of the nursery school board?
   The door opened, the butterfly flew inside and I saw a pair of pointy
black suede mules with a discreet two-inch heel. They looked as sleek and
fast as a cigarette boat. I suddenly remembered that I am the nursery
school board's recording secretary. A person entrusted with the
responsibility of taking the minutes every month should look put together,
no?
   I went in. I browsed. I found it so easy to sit back and let the action
unfold.  ``It's a quicker way to convey more information and at the same
time you ask the shopper to do less work,''  Ausnit said. Then he added, as
if this were a good thing, ``This technology will be explosive because it's
 fun.''
    Ausnit, who does not have to pay the credit card bills in my household,
probably also would be charmed by the fact that as  the suede mule, the
shoe stayed in perspective, getting bigger. He might even be thrilled to
know that after I clicked on it, the shoe floated off its perch to preen in
midair like some enchanted object in a Harry Potter novel, spinning so
close to my face that I was afraid the pointy toe would nick my nose and
draw blood. I was in the Seventh Circle of Shopping and these were the
Suede Mules from Hell. From Hell, I tell you.
       I phoned Gayle Tremblay, vice president of Neiman Marcus Online, to
ask her how in good conscience she could tempt shoppers so cruelly.
   She did not seem wracked by guilt. ``I can tell you, those shoes would
look fabulous on you,''  Tremblay said. ``You can wear them with anything.
With jeans.''
    I looked once more at the very, very, very beautiful shoes. I pictured
myself wearing them. Even in jeans, I would look very, very, very
beautiful. I would float in midair.
   Then I noticed the price, displayed unobtrusively on screen to the right
of the RichFX window: $445.
   That brought me back to reality.  I went upstairs to my closet and
unearthed a pair of black and witchy Manolo Blahnik pumps I bought at a
triple-reduced-price-end-of-season sale a few years back (they still cost
too much). Wearing them, I sat down in front of my husband's computer to
play Doom, which suddenly seemed a lot safer.

TEXAS COUPLE MAKES AN ART OF LIVING SMALL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By GAILE ROBINSON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLESON, Texas _ It's a landmark house. Not the historically
recognized kind, but one the neighbors will use to give directions.
``We're two houses past the metal box.''
</P>
<P>
   The 2-story galvanized metal and stucco house is remarkable for
many reasons, not just for its role as a directional beacon.
</P>
<P>
   It's the size of a three-Suburban garage: large by garage
standards, teensy-weensy by house standards.
</P>
<P>
   It was designed by an architect, Aledo-based Richard Wintersole.
</P>
<P>
   It's in Burleson, Texas, a Fort Worth suburb.
</P>
<P>
   The home of Michael Young, 31, and Gayla LaBry 32, is not tiny
because the owners wanted minuscule. They wanted a well-designed,
high-functioning house, built of quality materials, that they could
pay for in cash.
</P>
<P>
   This ruled out most of what was on the market. ``I couldn't
imagine buying an existing house,'' says Young. ``They're ugly. Big
and ugly.'' He also says he couldn't imagine not hiring an
architect, a sophisticated decision, rarely on the first-time
home-buyer's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   After collaborating with Wintersole and hiring Aledo contractor
Mike Barnett, Young and LaBry have what many people aspire to _ a
unique, spare, streamlined house, free of clutter.
</P>
<P>
   The entire house, one large room actually, is a clutter-free
zone, an aspect of living in a small space that takes some
discipline. ``In our apartment we had clothes all over the place,''
Young says. In his new house, the clothes washer and dryer are next
to the bedroom closet, and clothes do not tend to migrate.
</P>
<P>
   Living in one room ``forces us to be neater,'' says LaBry. There
is a place for everything and if there isn't, it can't stay. ``When
we shop we look for things we need and have a place for,'' she
says. Already she has received some problematic housewarming
presents. Gifts for small-space users, says LaBry, should ``be
consumable.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to move-in day in May, LaBry and Young got rid of all
their knickknacks. After 11 years of marriage, LaBry admits they
had a number of former treasures that had lost all meaning. Even
though they came from apartment life, Young knew the pitfalls of
multiple bedrooms and walk-in closets. ``The bigger the house, the
more stuff you put in it. The more stuff, the messier it gets. We
threw away a lot of junk, and we don't miss it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no hidden walls of storage, a garage for stacking
boxes and stowing the lawn mower, or an outbuilding.
</P>
<P>
   There are cabinets in the kitchen, a closet in the bedroom, and
some linen storage in the bathroom. Period.
</P>
<P>
   They willingly chose this. The economy of space and of storage
were just two of the many things on Young and LaBry's list. They
wanted metal; they liked the low-maintenance aspect and the look.
They wanted open space, lots of windows and a porch. Before they
even met Wintersole, Young had noodled out some plans on his
laptop. He and LaBry had scoured magazines and books, tearing out
photos of houses and details they liked from ``Metropolitan Home''
and ``Fine Homebuilding'' magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Once the final plans were drafted, Young, who is a
manufacturer's engineer in the glass business, acted as his own
purchasing agent. He found the windows, appliances and lighting
systems. He bought every switch, every outlet. ``I got what I
wanted for a decent price. Light fixtures can run thousands of
dollars. All my light fixtures cost less than $300.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the space is small and storage at a premium, the living
area seems expansive. The space is manipulated by furniture
specifically chosen by Young and LaBry. The living room chairs are
transparent, so they do not consume any visual space. The long,
dark purple planes of the armless B&AMP;B Italia sofa seem to levitate
off the slender chrome legs.
</P>
<P>
   The counter top in the kitchen extends to form the window ledge,
making an uninterrupted horizontal line. The vertical-space wall of
floor-to-ceiling cabinets, double ovens and refrigerator is equally
smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bit of space is wasted. Nothing is out of place.

PEOPLE WHO LOVE AUTUMN'S BOUNTY WILL FALL FOR THIS BOOK
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By GAILE ROBINSON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are people who are captivated by fallen leaves, and there
is everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Author Louise Kollenbaum is captivated. ``One fall I pressed so
many leaves that they spilled over from my studio into the living
room. Rather than apologize to visitors. I simply gave the look a
designer name, `Herbarium chic.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Kollenbaum has written a book for those who spend the month of
October hunkered over, searching the ground for yet another
wonderful example of nature's palette. (Hint: If you know one of
the leaf people, this book is great present material.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Fallen Leaves'' (Chronicle Books, $22.95) is about the art of
pressing leaves. Even better, the book is a piece of art. The
binding is a clever configuration with elastic bands that allow for
expansion as the book fills with leaves, glassine pages for
displaying leaves, and journal pages for record keeping and deep
thoughts. Poetry about trees is included on the journal pages for
inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   The leaves that illustrate the book are quite lovely, instilling
a desire to collect fall's beauty even if one has never done so
before. There is an artistry in selecting leaves, but the list of
materials needed for pressing is quite basic.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The basic ingredients for pressing include:
</P>
<P>
   a leaf
</P>
<P>
   blotter paper
</P>
<P>
   newspaper
</P>
<P>
   a press or heavy books
</P>
<P>
   six to eight weeks' drying time

 &HT;    BUSH URGES GORE TO 'GET IT ON' WITH LIMITED DEBATES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ George W. Bush challenged Al Gore on Wednesday to
``get it on'' with presidential debates, even as he insisted on a
plan that would significantly limit the number of voters viewing
the face-to-face encounters.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge coincided with a new Bush TV ad campaign
suggesting that Gore's refusal to accept the Texas governor's
debate terms illustrates the vice president's lack of credibility.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's challenge also coincided with a coast-to-coast flood
of newspaper editorials criticizing the Republican nominee for
rejecting a three-debate proposal by the bipartisan Commission on
Presidential Debates, which was organized in 1988 to end the
bickering that typically surrounds them.
</P>
<P>
   And it led to suggestions from political analysts that Bush's
display of bravado, while highlighting Gore's credibility problems,
also reinforces the view that the governor is not ready for
prime-time encounters with the Democratic nominee, whose debating
skills are highly regarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has given people the feeling that he's afraid to meet
Gore,'' said Larry Sabato, an expert on the media and politics at
the University of Virginia. ``Bush doesn't want to be followed by a
guy in a chicken costume, which will happen soon if this isn't
resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's get it on, Mr. Gore,'' Bush declared Wednesday morning
at the end of an NBC ``Today'' program interview in which the
governor continued to insist on one debate and two joint talk-show
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Rival TV networks have said they would not carry the talk shows,
meaning the sessions would reach only a fraction of the viewers
that the commission-sponsored debates ordinarily draw.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the joint interviews would be in Washington next
Tuesday, hosted by NBC's Tim Russert. Bush vowed Wednesday that he
would show up for the event, even though an NBC spokeswoman said it
would not air without Gore. ``We offered a debate, not an
appearance,'' said NBC's Barbara Levin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to play games to try to substitute a talk show
for the national bipartisan commission debates that everybody can
see,'' Gore said on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would allow Bush to appear on NBC alone, Gore
replied, ``Oh, sure. Absolutely. ... It's seen by far fewer people
and, again, I'm happy to do it, but not as a substitute for the
main debates that the bipartisan commission has set up.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission has proposed three 90-minute debates between Bush
and Gore next month. All three would be televised simultaneously by
the major TV networks in order to minimize the number of viewers
fleeing to other programming.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also has proposed one debate between the two vice
presidential nominees, Republican Dick Cheney and Democrat Joe
Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has rejected that plan. In addition to the one-hour joint
interview with Russert, the governor has proposed another one-hour
joint appearance on CNN's ``Larry King Live'' program and one
commission-sponsored debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the three debates I'll do,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Russert's ``Meet The Press'' program averages 3.6 million
viewers on Sunday mornings, and ``Larry King Live'' which airs
daily during the week, normally draws 936,000.
</P>
<P>
   The commission-sponsored debates in 1996 between President
Clinton and former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole averaged 41.2
million viewers. And the 1992 debates involving President George
Bush, Clinton and independent Ross Perot drew a record 90.3 million
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush's handlers seem resigned to their man taking a drubbing
at the hands of Gore and want the audience as small as possible,''
observed the Denver Post, one of the many newspapers whose
editorial pages weighed in Wednesday with harsh criticism of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But the new Bush TV ad titled ``Credibility'' notes that Gore
had previously agreed to debate Bush ``any time, any place,
anywhere'' but now refuses to meet the governor on the NBC and CNN
programs. ``If we can't trust Al Gore on debates, why should we
trust him on anything?'' the ad says.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign, in response, questioned Bush's own
credibility by pointing to an August interview with CNN in which
the governor insisted he hoped ``more people watch'' the debates
than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than spending millions of dollars on negative ads,
George W. Bush should do what his father and Bob Dole did and agree
to the bipartisan proposal for debates,'' said Ron Klain, a senior
Gore campaign official. ``Governor Bush should end the excuses and
the name-calling and live up to his commitment to ensuring that
more people watch the debates than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrell West, a political science professor at Brown University,
said the Bush and Gore camps both look bad in the squabble over the
debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters see this as politicians arguing over trivial details,''
West said. ``Neither side looks good. Bush appears as if he is
ducking sustained questioning, while Gore has broken his word to
debate anywhere, anytime.''

 &HT;    BUSH URGES GORE TO 'GET IT ON' WITH LIMITED DEBATES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ George W. Bush challenged Al Gore on Wednesday to
``get it on'' with presidential debates, even as he insisted on a
plan that would significantly limit the number of voters viewing
the face-to-face encounters.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge coincided with a new Bush TV ad campaign
suggesting that Gore's refusal to accept the Texas governor's
debate terms illustrates the vice president's lack of credibility.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's challenge also coincided with a coast-to-coast flood
of newspaper editorials criticizing the Republican nominee for

weekly column which moves on Wednesdays.) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: The bathroom sink in my old apartment has developed an
annoying sewer-like odor that seems to be coming up through the
drain opening.
 &HT;    The sink drains out OK, but I tried cleaning out the drain line
anyway, using a chemical cleaner. There was no apparent clog.
 &HT;    I then disconnected the drain line where it goes down through
the floor below the trap. I used a ``snake'' to probe the drain for
clogs, but found none.
 &HT;    What do you think could be causing the odor?
 &HT;    A: From your description of the trap and drain line it sounds as
though you have an ``S'' type trap under your sink. Although most
codes no longer permit installation of this type, some older houses
still do have them.
 &HT;    The purpose of any plumbing trap is to keep the U-shaped section
full of water, thus forming a seal against any sewer gases coming
up through the drain opening.
 &HT;    However, with an ``S'' type trap this seal can be lost when a
heavy flow of waste water goes down the drain and actually siphons
water out of the trap. This is very unlikely with a ``P'' trap
which goes horizontally through the wall behind the sink.
 &HT;    Your problem can be solved by simply adding more water to the
trap. Open a faucet and allow water to run into the drain opening
for about 10 seconds.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Even when I don't flush my toilet, the water seems to come on
and the toilet seems to run by itself. It does this periodically
several times, then stops for awhile, sometimes not happening again
for several days.
 &HT;    Can a neighborhood handyman fix this, or is it something only an
experienced plumber can repair safely?
 &HT;    A: I believe your problem is caused by a worn flapper valve that
is no longer forming a tight seal against its seat or opening in
the bottom of the flush tank.
 &HT;    The poor seal allows water to leak through into the toilet, even
when it is not flushed. As the water level inside the tank drops,
the ballcock (the inlet valve) opens and more water comes into the
tank to fill it. This cycle is repeated until finally the flapper
does form a tight seal.
 &HT;    Replacing the rubber flapper valve with a new one should solve
your problem, and is a very simple task you can do yourself.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: The self-adhesive, non-skid plastic appliques that I applied
to the bottom of my bathtub some years ago have worn off, but the
outline of each applique is still noticeable.
 &HT;    I have tried various cleaners, but the shapes remain. Can you
suggest anything?
 &HT;    A: The residue that you see is probably slight remnants of the
adhesive that are still left on the tub's finish.
 &HT;    This can be cleaned off by using one of the special adhesive
removers on the market, such as the one made by 3M.
 &HT;    A solvent such as lacquer thinner or nail polish remover also
works well in most cases.
 &HT;    If all of these fail, and if the design has actually soaked into
the finish, then the only other possibility I can think of would be
to try a bleach _ assuming the tub is white. I cannot say how
bleach would affect a colored tub.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Some years ago a telescoping jack post was installed under
one of the beams in my basement to provide support for a stone
fireplace on the main floor above it.
 &HT;    In recent years I notice that there is considerable cracking in
the concrete floor and the crack extends about 12 feet across the
floor.
 &HT;    What is the simplest and least expensive remedy for this?
 &HT;    A: The crack is probably due to the fact that a proper footing
or foundation was never put down under it to properly support the
post, so now all the weight is on the concrete floor slab, causing
it to crack.
 &HT;    The only cure now is to replace this post with a new one that
sits on a proper footing. This usually means digging through the
floor and going down about 12 inches. Then pour a 12-cubic-inch
block of concrete and set the new post on top of this.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Questions about home-repair problems should be addressed to
Bernard Gladstone, care of The New York Times Syndication Sales
Corp., 122 E. 42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10168. Questions of general
interest will be answered in this column; Mr. Gladstone regrets
that unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    NOTE: Drawing captioned ``PLUMBING TRAPS'' goes with this
column.
 &HT;    CAPTION: Outmoded ``S'' trap (top) can allow water to be
siphoned out of trap, thus allowing sewer gases to enter. Approved
type ``P'' trap (below) prevents this.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Bush has muddled debate issue
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush is back in full-smirk mode now that he's muddled
the issue over presidential campaign debates. He appears to think
he has muddled it successfully, and perhaps he has.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't Al Gore say he would debate Bush any time anywhere and
isn't he now, just as Bush charges, refusing to do just that?
Indeed. But Gore's rhetorical sally assumed Bush would first buy
into the debates that the presidential debate commission would set
up. After all, every candidate since 1988 had, including daddy
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is trying to suggest, without quite saying so and thus
laying himself own to challenge on the point, that there's some sly
partisan dirty work afoot in the commission's proposal for three
stand-up debates to be telecast on all networks simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, however, is rigorously bipartisan and has as its
sole client the American electorate. If Bush thinks holding one of
the debates near _ near, not in _ the Kennedy Library is, in
effect, a thumb on the scale, then surely an alternative site could
be picked. This is a triviality, easily fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says he would go for one commission debate, but for the
rest wants to sit down for schmooze-fests with Gore on NBC's ``Meet
the Press'' with Tim Russert and on CNN's ``Larry King Live.''
Russert at least knows politics but King, a celebrity debriefer, is
to politics what, oh, rocks are to an omelette.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor figures the relative informality of those
shows -- and ``shows'' is the right word -- would favor his genial,
good old boy manner while showing that Gore sits up straight. They
would also limit any damage Bush might do to himself. The
audiences, by most estimates, would be a third or a fourth the size
of audiences for full-out debates.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion Bush has sown has had the, to him, happy side
effect of suckering NBC and CNN into de facto cahoots with his
proposal. Each would love to have the coup he has offered it and
NBC has fallen to all but promoting the idea outright. Its
newscasts were pushing NBC's offer to share ``Meet the Press'' with
other networks on the morning when newspapers were reporting, and
NBC was not, that CBS and ABC already had announced they would
reject programs originating on other networks.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush has managed to confuse this matter enough to neutralize
the advantage Gore had enjoyed in it previously, well, that's
politics. But if the winner isn't clear, the loser is. That's the
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   The evolved tradition of formal presidential debates offered
voters a chance to assess the candidates outside the narrow lists
of their thrust-and-parry TV ads and free of their megabuck self
aggrandizements. The custom, too, had closed off the candidates
from the past practice of bickering their way out of debates
altogether -- or had seem to until this Bush ploy.
</P>
<P>
   All needn't be lost. If Bush accepts the commission debates, he
would be free to taunt Gore into other formats and venues, turning
a disservice to voters into a service.

   U.N.-CLINTON (United Nations) - President Clinton on Wednesday
told the largest gathering of world leaders in history that the
United Nations must reconfigure itself to deal with a world in
which there are ``fewer wars between nations, but more wars within
them.'' With the energy of a man who sees his moment on the world
stage quickly slipping away, he immediately used the Millennium
Summit meeting here to take a last stab at many of the issues that
have defied resolution during his presidency. He tried to fend off
a proposal from Russian president Vladimir Putin that would lead to
a demilitarization of outer space - an effort by Putin to put an
end to American talk of a national missile defense - and met with
the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, and Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak in one last effort to rescue the Middle East peace
process. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   U.N.-MILLENNIUM-SUMMIT (United Nations) - The question hangs out
there. Why would 152 leaders leave their not-always-stable
governments unattended to come to New York and make five-minute
speeches, mostly to each other and the television cameras from back
home? Secretary General Kofi Annan had an answer today as he lifted
his glass to the biggest power lunch in history. ``You,'' he said,
looking out over the world's political elite, ``have the ability to
transform the lives of 6 billion people.'' By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   WTIMOR-U.N.-KILLINGS (United Nations) - An armed mob ran amok
through a U.N. refugee office in West Timor on Wednesday, beating
to death three unarmed U.N. workers, including an American, and
touching off repercussions of outrage halfway around the world at
the Millenium Summit meeting of world leaders here. By Christoher

   NY-MAFIA-ARRESTS (New York) - The Manhattan district attorney
Wednesday charged 38 union officials, contractors and reputed
mobsters with bribery, bid-rigging or other racketeering schemes
that siphoned millions of dollars from public and private building
projects throughout the city over the last two years. By William K.
Rashbaum.
</P>
<P>
   NY-BELGIUM-ROYALS (New York) - The royals are coming. No, no,
not the poor old British Crown Prince, still overshadowed by the
tragic legacy of Diana, Princess of Wales. Nor any of his
relatives, like that fellow who flies the helicopter and his former
lady who does the weight-loss thing. No, New York is getting the
other ones, the fabulously cool new royals: handsome Crown Prince
Philippe of Belgium and his ravishing Princess Mathilde, the
fairy-tale couple that has monopolized magazine covers and glossy
photo spreads throughout Europe. Their mission is nothing less than
to take New York City by storm, winning hearts, minds, media and,
more importantly, market share. By Glenn Collins.

   DNA-CONVICTION (Richmond, Va.) - Six years after DNA testing
raised strong doubts about his guilt in a rape and homicide
conviction, Earl Washington Jr., a model prisoner with the IQ of a
10-year-old, awaited the results of a more definitive test today as
his lawyers filed a petition for a full executive pardon after 17
years in prison. His lawyers, pioneers in the increasingly
successful DNA challenges of criminal convictions, describe
Washington as their long suffering poster child, an amiable,
passive farm hand with an IQ of 69 whose habit is to cooperatively
agree with people. They maintain his case is a summary of the main
problems prompting the rising national concern about capital
convictions: race, mental incapacity, convictions based solely on
confession, appeal limitations, and the inevitable pressures of
politics. By Francis X. Clines.

&HT;    AUSTRALIAN E-CAFES OFFER COMMUNICATION AND MORE QL
</HEADLINE>
 QL  (EDS: in reference to Micheal O'Grady, spelling is CQ) QL 
By JEAN E. HERSKOWITZ QC 
 &HT;    c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service QC 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years ago, while touring Britain,  Philip Dean had to use Internet
connections  at local universities to e-mail home.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days there really weren't any Internet cafes there,'' said
Dean, a 29-year-old British native transplanted to Australia. His  desire
to communicate easily and cheaply with faraway friends resulted in his
opening Global Gossip  - ``a store with phone booths and a couple of
terminals'' -  along with  Peter Ovenden, 31, after  Dean returned from
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The store grew into a chain of 12 Internet  and telephone
``lounges,'' spread across nine Australian cities.  Visitors to any of the
communication centers can fax, phone, scan, rent a mailbox, photocopy and
send e-mail. Global Gossip's young owners are seeking U.S.-based partners
for  global expansion.
</P>
<P>
   And Global Gossip isn't alone. As visitors to Australia for the
Olympics will find, they may be down under, but they won't have to be out
of touch. In the past three years, Sydney -  the capital of the Australian
state of New South Wales and its most populated city, with 3.7 million
residents -  has seen an explosion of Internet cafes. As England, Israel
and other countries have, Australia has proved fertile ground for the
spread of the cafes, which are a big attraction to backpacking tourists.
</P>
<P>
   For them, e-mail is the preferred mode of communication.  It's less
expensive than calling home (although some of the cafes offer international
calling amenities) and easier than postcards.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the  35,000 customers who pop into a Global Gossip
each week are between the ages of  18 and 29, according to the site.
Sixty percent  are visitors from abroad.  Local people gravitate toward the
faxing, photocopying and scanning services, said  Dean, who compared Global
Gossip to a ``more fun'' Kinko's in that regard.     Australians with PCs
at home also stop by,  for the social experience.     ``There's atmosphere
and energy,''  Dean said.  ``People enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydney  picked up e-cafe fever around 1997, when a few cafe
owners  decided to perk up business by installing a smattering of
computers.  When it soon became clear that the mouse pads were getting more
hits than the mocha, cybercafes began to be cloned in every semi-inhabited
corner of the Southern Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   A stroll around any urban neighborhood in Sydney bears out
Australia's affinity for the net.  The cafes line the streets, crammed with
young people, their eyes glued to glowing screens, fingers tapping
frantically. Many cafes stay open past midnight. And a number are located
on  the notorious Darlinghurst Road in the Kings Cross section of Sydney -
the central strip of the city's red-light district (fairly safe as
red-light districts go) and a backpacker's main stomping ground for
low-cost room and board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Australia seems kind of ahead in this area,''  said 37-year-old
Dr. Sally Harrison, from England, who is  working in a local hospital for a
year.   Her explanation for the phenomenon: Australians are ``obsessed with
the fact that they're cut off from the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Some cafes subscribe to the all-Internet, no-hoopla approach.
Sydney's Eagles Internet cafe is a ``stock, standard Internet cafe that
offers peace and quiet,'' according to its manager, Micheal O'Grady.  ``We
don't crowd our room out with lots of people, and only have a maximum of 12
people at once.  Plenty of space and nothing to interrupt them.  It keeps
them coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Competition, however, has made many cafe operators less spartan
about services offered, resulting in creative price arrangements for jaded
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Global Gossip offers patrons a stamp for each half hour they
spend online; those who collect five stamps  receive a free half-hour.
Other cybercafes lure visitors in to check their e-mail, offering the first
two minutes free.
</P>
<P>
   The more experimental cafe owners have traveled beyond the
Internet in their quest for distinction.
</P>
<P>
   The 300-seat Fountain Cafe, on the edge of Kings Cross, offers
multitaskers access to one of 40 terminals in the downstairs cybercafe,
food and beer in the restaurant (the menu includes the ``Aussie burger with
chips and soft drink and 1 hour on the Net'' for about $6 and  salon
services next door at the cafe's high-tech beauty salon.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalind Turner, 43, an Australian freelance journalist,  isn't
online at home, so she uses the Fountain's computers for the Olympic
stories she is working on.  The cafe has ``lots of  Swedish accents, and
lots of Irish and pommy accents,'' she noted. (``Pommy'' is Australians'
slang for the many Britons among them.) ``They know each other from the
hostels.''  She likes the casualness of the place.  ``The owner lets people
drink coffee and eat hamburgers downstairs, so he's not really worried
about greasy fingers on the keyboards.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner appreciates the array of conveniences.  ``I have a massage
every couple of weeks, I get a peel whenever I feel like it.''  After her
massage she goes next door to the cafe, logs on and checks her e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics are also getting in on the action.  The Athlete's
Village will have a cybercafe - the Surf Shack - where  the athletes can
respond to fans' e-mail as part of IBM's FanMail program. ``FanMail  is a
Web site we debuted in 1996 at the Atlanta Games,'' said Joyce Lagas, a
communications employee with  IBM's Olympic project. ``It lets people from
around the world send good luck and congratulations to the athletes.''  The
site is at www.ibm.com/fanmail.
</P>
<P>
   IBM is also opening a Surf Shack for public consumption, which
will be floating on a barge in Sydney's Darling Harbor.  People can stop by
to send e-mail to their favorite athletes, view the Olympics Web site
(www.olympics.com) and check out IBM technology that was created for the
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Olympic Village Surf Shack's official opening was last
Saturday, Lagas observed that team trainers, coaches and officials had
already been dropping in for weeks to e-mail their families back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in 1996, the Internet was in its infancy, but still we
received over 100,000 e-mails for the athletes at the Atlanta Games,''
Lagas said.    ``Two years later, at the Nagano Games -  and winter Games
tend to be smaller, with fewer athletes -  we had 300,000 messages sent
from 126 countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Will the ultradisciplined athletes succumb to the lure of the
Internet cafe?  IBM thinks so.  True, the 3,800-square-foot Athlete's
Village Surf Shack with more than 60 computers will serve no food.  But
``they can play computer games here,''  Lagas said, ``and we also have a
giant video wall set up,'' with a feed from the events once the Games start.

centers around the 80,000 fans that pack the facility each game and

<TEXT>
      Before the introduction of gypsum wallboard, interior walls were
finished with plaster. Wallboard is essentially a flat sheet of plaster
sandwiched between sheets of special paper. Unlike plaster, wallboard is
fastened to the studs in a dry state and for this reason it is frequently
called drywall. (It is also sometimes called Sheetrock, but this is a trade
name of the USG Corp. and should only be used in reference to its product.)
    The thickness of wallboard varies from one-fourth to 5/8 of an inch in
1/8-inch increments. The half-inch thickness is best for most uses.
Use  the thicker 5/8-inch board in areas where a firewall is required or on
walls to muffle sound transmission. The thinner grades, 3/8 and 1/4-inch,
should only be used for curved wall surfaces or on walls where the new
material will have to match the thickness of a thin adjacent  wall.
    Wallboard is also available with a water-resistant core. This product
should be installed in areas where humidity may be a problem, such as damp
basements. Water-resistant wallboard is not waterproof, however, and should
not be used in  wet areas like showers (where it is best to install cement
backer board with a waterproof membrane).
    The standard width of wallboard panels is 4 feet. Panels vary in length
from 6 feet to 16 feet. The most popular lengths are 8 and 12 feet. The
larger panels cover more area, creating fewer joints to tape, but they
are  heavy -   12-foot panels weigh 82 pounds; the 8-foot panels weigh 55
pounds - and are difficult to maneuver in small rooms.
    You can use drywall nails or screws to secure the panels to the studs,
but  screws are superior fasteners because they do not pop loose like nails
can. Use 1 1/4-inch screws for mounting 1/2-inch-thick wallboard, and 1
5/8-inch  screws for 5/8-inch-thick panels. The ideal tool to use for
driving drywall screws is a drywall screwgun (this can be rented at rental
centers). It is better than a variable speed drill because it has an
adjustable nose that allows you to set the screws at a precise depth and it
operates at low torque  so the screws will not rip into the plaster core.
    To estimate the quantity of material needed, add the total surface area
that you intend to panel. Do not deduct the area of the doors and windows
unless  they are very large. Then divide that number by the total square
feet per sheet. A 4-by-8 panel covers 32 square feet and a 4-by-12 covers
48 square  feet.
    Drywall does not store well, so try to order the exact number of panels
needed. At your work site, stack the panels on edge, making sure they
are  evenly supported so they do not bend or warp.
    Before mounting the wallboard, check the condition of the plumbing and
electrical lines in the walls and make any repairs or additions
while  everything is still exposed. Next, check the corners where adjacent
walls meet and where the walls and ceiling join. Usually the corner posts
and the top  plates do not extend far enough to provide support for the
drywall. It is best to nail backers made of 2-by-4's to provide mounting
surfaces in these  places.
    If you are finishing an entire room, start by installing the ceiling
panels (called the lids) first, and then work on the walls from the top
down. When the  wall panels are in place they will support the ceiling.
    Lifting drywall panels overhead is hard work. You will need a helper
for this. You can also rent a drywall jack (also called a lift) at rental
outlets  to raise the panels and hold them in place while you secure them
to the joists.
    Whenever possible, try to install complete panels so you will have
fewer joints to tape over. There will be areas where you will have to cut a
panel to  fit. First, mark the length needed on the finish side of the
board, then score across the line with a utility knife. Use a metal
straightedge as a guide.  Stand the wallboard on edge and bend it toward
the backside; this will snap the board at the score line. Once the board
breaks, fold it back to form a right  angle. Cut the backing paper at the
fold with the utility knife.
    Press the panel against the studs and drive the screws, spaced evenly
every 12 inches, through the board into the studs. It is important to drive
the  screws so the heads are slightly depressed below the surface of the
panel yet not so deep the screw breaks through the paper. If you do drive a
screw too  deep, install another about an inch away, then remove the
improperly set screw.

REALITY TV CRAZE KEEPS WRITERS IDLE

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Terese Kelly's daily ritual: Out of bed by 7,
check industry trade papers by 8, call agent by 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything?'' is all she asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing'' is all she hears.
</P>
<P>
   It's another typical day for a Hollywood TV writer in the Age of
Real TV.
</P>
<P>
   One would expect a proven writer, with two situation comedies, a
drama and a Nickelodeon children's program under her belt, to be
something of a catch _ particularly in a medium whose creative
mediocrity has long been blamed on too much demand for the
available talent pool.
</P>
<P>
   But Kelly, who is 27 with an 18-month-old daughter and $1,567.35
in rent due on a tiny two-bedroom apartment, is facing unemployment
in her chosen profession for what could be a full year.
</P>
<P>
   In a company town as political and fickle as Los Angeles, you
can never assume automatic hiring, no matter what your resume. But
Kelly stands as the unseen, unheard _ and unexpected _ casualty of
the current fascination with so-called reality shows that are
largely unscripted.
</P>
<P>
   It's simple arithmetic, really. Reality shows such as
``Survivor'' and ``Big Brother'' on CBS and game shows such as
``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire'' on ABC are occupying prime
programming real estate previously rented to fictional
entertainment programs. Add the continued popularity of
newsmagazines such as ``Dateline NBC'' and ``20/20,'' and the job
opportunities for TV writers shrink even more.
</P>
<P>
   What a change from just five years ago, when good writers were
considered an endangered species, when there was an insane bidding
war for mediocre talent that allowed writer/producers with modest
hits to sign exorbitant, record-breaking deals.
</P>
<P>
   Now, veteran writers with solid credentials are enduring their
own version of ``Survivor,'' with often-dire consequences.
</P>
<P>
   For networks and studios that own the shows, it's simply a
matter of economics. A typical episode of ``Millionaire'' costs an
estimated $750,000 (unless a contestant wins $1 million), whereas
dramas like ``The Practice'' on ABC and ``Providence'' on NBC cost
around $1.2 million per episode. Firmly established sitcoms such as
``Frasier'' and ``Friends'' are nestled in even pricier
neighborhoods _ around $3 million per episode.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the downside to the game shows and reality
programming is that, unlike popular dramas and sitcoms, they are
expected to fare poorly in repeats and therefore could never be
sold in syndication.
</P>
<P>
   Still, CBS is betting that the wildly addictive ``Survivor''
will buck that trend, based on its ratings strength and the fact
that a number of viewers who watched the two-hour finale were
first-timers lured in by the media hype who will now backtrack to
see what they missed. The network will rebroadcast ``Survivor''
episodes nightly beginning Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Why viewers also may be worse off with this new look in TV
programming is also simple arithmetic. For the fall TV season, 44
sitcoms and 43 dramas will air, down from 60 sitcoms and 40 dramas
of a year ago and 64 sitcoms and 36 dramas from the year before
that. In terms of writing slots this season, that's a drop-off of
200 jobs, because one show employs up to a dozen or more writers
during the season.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's scheduling of a fourth hour of ``Millionaire'' this season
means just seven of the 23 hours of prime-time programming on that
network will be occupied by scripted entertainment shows. The rest
will be divided up among game shows, ``Monday Night Football,''
newsmagazines, movies and The Wonderful World of Disney franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it a time of concern for the creative community _ yeah, you
could say that,'' says J.J. Abrams, creator of the coming-of-age
drama ``Felicity.'' ``I can't say that I've had my colleagues
jumping out of windows or even changing careers just yet. But as a
producer of a show that is constantly on the bubble, there's less
of an opportunity to be creative for fear that if it fails, you'll
lose audience and be replaced by a reality program about nuns or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of reality shows is putting a lot of actors,
writers, producers and crews out of business in the short term,
``but it would be a long-term disaster if we find ourselves dealing
with only three comedies, four dramas and the rest reality shows,''
says veteran producer Aaron Spelling, whose latest drama serial is
``Titans'' on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never do a reality show,'' he says. ``I mean, the day
will come when I'll probably be asked to do a reality show in a
house of prostitution _ that's how far out and silly this whole
thing has become.''
</P>
<P>
   But as silly as the reality-programming craze has become, it's
deadly serious to writers who find themselves suddenly on the
outside looking in.
</P>
<P>
   Terese Kelly and her colleagues saw the reality trend coming but
never thought it would affect established writers. For several
weeks beginning in mid-May and creeping into June, writers who make
their living working for shows such as ``Nash Bridges'' and ``JAG''
cast about for fall assignments.
</P>
<P>
   During that month or so when shows are making final decisions
about their writing staffs, scribes who've been asked back to
returning shows have the luxury of looking around for other
opportunities without desperation in their eyes. But Kelly, whose
series, ``Oh Grow Up,'' was canceled last season, didn't have a
fall-back position. MORE &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ fall-back position.
</P>
<P>
   And when the phone didn't ring by mid-July, she began to panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing this for six years now, and never has there
been such little activity or movement,'' she says. ``My friends who
have writing jobs aren't going anywhere because they're scared to,
and those without jobs are going to the dot-coms or waiting it out
by waiting on tables. Me? I'm just depressed. It doesn't look like
it's letting up anytime soon.''
</P>
<P>
   She's right. With ``Millionaire'' still averaging 28 million
viewers per episode, and 51 million watching the final
``Survivor,'' CBS is already planning ``Survivor 2,'' and other
reality shows are in the pipeline there and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reality shows coming up on the major networks are
``The Mole,'' in which contestants complete a series of tasks while
being undermined by an infiltrator; ``The Runner,'' which follows
``fugitives'' as they attempt to avoid detection by viewers; and
``Chains of Love,'' which consists of a person chained to five
members of the opposite sex over a five-day period, with one
individual banished each day until only one remains. The WB is
preparing a reality series called ``Popstars'' and another that
will follow a group of young people planning an Internet
publication. Even VH1 is getting in on the act, with production
under way on ``Bands on the Run.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that jobs in the short term are being
diminished,'' says Peter Roth, president of Warner Bros., which
produces shows like ``ER'' and ``The West Wing.'' ``But I just
can't see the cream of the crop ever going away.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth thinks the current situation will end up being good for the
writers who survive _ and, more important, for viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, it should force us to work harder, to do better,
to make something fresh and interesting for people to watch. My
theory all along has been that reality programming is succeeding
because the audience is simply sick and tired of being asked to
choose between one piece of junk that's only slightly different
from another piece of junk.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but writers say networks are so fixated on reality
programming that they simply no longer have an appetite for
anything within the more traditional genres. Judd Apatow, a writer
and executive producer of NBC's canceled ``Freaks and Geeks,'' said
his series didn't stand a chance in this atmosphere and that a new
show of his, ``Happy Together,'' was flat-out rejected by NBC
without even a pilot episode being ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Series projects produced by established writer/producers like
Yvette Lee Bowser and Ralph Farguhar (''Moesha, The Parkers'') were
also shut out of the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were real estate, we'd say it's a seller's market,''
says Cecil Gerald, an unemployed comedy writer who has worked on
``Amen, Martin'' and ``The Wayans Bros.'' and who, like many of his
writing buddies, is willing to drop his salary to land a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I'm single, I've got a roommate. But many of my friends
are selling their souls to work because they have mortgage payments
and car payments and children,'' says Gerald, who says he has
enough savings to wait out a season. ``It's depressing and kind of
scary to know that (shows) are basically sitting back selecting.''
</P>
<P>
   But if there's an upside to this seller's market, it's that
shows are being more selective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say that our staff has never been more capable,''
says Steven Bochco, who has overhauled his medical drama, ``City of
Angels,'' in front of and behind the camera. The series is getting
a last-chance shot on CBS this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Bochco says fewer job openings have forced talented, proven
writers who are capable of creating their own shows to remain on
writing staffs, thereby making them much stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are those who think this is much ado about
nothing. Dick Wolf, creator of ``Law &AMP; Order,'' told TV critics
assembled for the winter press tour in January that ``Everything's
cyclical. Sixteen years ago, comedy was dead, and along came (Bill)
Cosby. Game shows were dead, and now they're No. 1. But the reality
is that episodic series television has been a mainstay for 50 years
and will remain so.''
</P>
<P>
   While waiting for the pendulum to swing back their way, many
writers are turning to cable. HBO, TNT, Showtime, Lifetime and
other cable networks are offering more original dramas and sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, who has worked strictly for network shows, has instructed
her agent to look at anything. ``The Food Network. Disney. I don't
care at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Some industry watchers see the possibility of writers moving
from network shows to generally lesser-paid cable shows as a blow
that networks can absorb now but that will hurt later. ``When this
trend is over, a large number of the good writers will have already
made the leap to cable and could conceivably be tied up there,''
says Jorge Reyes, a former staffer on ``New York Undercover,'' who
is now a writer for Showtime's ``Resurrection Blvd.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All writers need is a taste of the freedom cable provides, and
they may not come back. If you think network stuff is bad now, wait
until they have to rely on second- and third-tier writers. When
considering the criticism of how bad a lot of the shows are
already, man, I shudder at the thought.''

   The Way of the Bunchberry
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have tried many times to transplant bunchberry (Cornus
canadensis), to no avail.  Now I have found some plants with red berries.
Will they contain seeds I can plant? Is this the right time to pick them,
and what are my chances of success?
</P>
<P>
   A. Collecting wildflower seed is much less destructive of native stands
than the gathering of plants, and in the case of bunchberries it's also
more likely to lead to success, said Cheryl Lowe, horticultural director of
the New England Wild Flower Society, in Framingham, Mass. The society has
had a lot of experience with these lovely little plants, which, at about 6
inches tall,  are the shortest native dogwoods. Lowe recommends the
following method of propagation.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, gather the berries as soon as they are soft and  part
readily from the plant. Crush them lightly. Then cover with cool water and
soak them for a week or so to loosen the clinging pulp. Strain, and then
work the mush between your fingers to free the seeds. Rinse them.
</P>
<P>
   Fill a planting flat with sterile potting mixture  and plant the
seeds 1/2 to 3/4 inch deep, 2 inches apart in all directions. Water
thoroughly from the bottom. Choose a partly shaded spot outdoors and sink
the flat so the top is level with the soil surface. Cover with a porous
plant cover like Reemay, to keep animals out and prevent splashing. Leave
for the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Start checking for seedlings in early spring and remove the cover
when they appear. When they have four leaves, transplant to a flat filled
with potting soil that has been mixed with a small amount of aged bark.
Sink the new flat as you did the old one. Keep the little plants moist but
not wet.
</P>
<P>
   Leave them in the nursery flat for another year; then transplant
to their final location, which should be partly shaded, cool  and damp.
Remember that bunchberries thrive in Greenland and will do best where chilly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farther north you go, the better they do,''  Lowe said. ``They
really don't like hot,  humid summers. Our best spot here  is a north
facing slope where a seeping spring keeps the ground cool all summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The New England Wild Flower Society sells bunchberry seeds; it is
at 180 Hemenway Road, Framingham, Mass. 01701; (508) 877-7630. Plants are
available from Fieldstone Gardens, 620 Quaker Lane, Vassalboro, Maine 04989
(207) 923-3836;  both catalogs are $2.50.
</P>
<P>
   Tomatoes Need Another Home
</P>
<P>
   Q.  I have been planting tomatoes for seven years.  Every year, they
grow well and yield a nice output of fruit. Then, around Aug. 1, the leaves
turn yellow, starting at the bottom and moving up the plants, which die in
a few weeks. I have been told that the cause is the acidity of the soil. I
have applied lime in substantial quantities, but this year the same thing
happened.
</P>
<P>
   A. Northeastern soils are usually on the acid side, and adding lime to
prevent them from becoming too acidic is an old farming tradition. But
adding large amounts of lime - or any other mineral - without knowing
whether you really need it can do more harm than good. It's always best to
get a soil analysis before taking action.
</P>
<P>
   Soil analysis can be done by the nearest agricultural extension
service, which may be listed in the phone book under Extension or
Cooperative Extension, under the name of the state university or with
county offices. The extension office will explain how to gather and send
the sample. In most states, you can also send a dead leaf or two and get an
expert autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting for the results, think about planting next year's
tomatoes somewhere tomatoes have never grown. It's likely the service will
tell you that your problem is not acidity but rather a fungus disease like
early blight (alternaria) or fusarium wilt. These diseases  are widespread,
and once they get into the soil they stay there for years.
</P>
<P>
   Address questions to Garden Q&AMP;A, The New York Times, 229 West 43rd
St., New York 10036, or by e-mail to gardening(at)nytimes.com. Those of
general interest will be published. Unpublished questions cannot be
answered individually.

AUSTRALIAN E-CAFES OFFER COMMUNICATION AND MORE
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: in reference to Micheal O'Grady, spelling is CQ) 
 By JEAN E. HERSKOWITZ 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years ago, while touring Britain, Philip Dean had to use
Internet connections at local universities to e-mail home.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days there really weren't any Internet cafes there,''
said Dean, a 29-year-old British native transplanted to Australia.
His desire to communicate easily and cheaply with faraway friends
resulted in his opening Global Gossip - ``a store with phone booths
and a couple of terminals'' - along with Peter Ovenden, 31, after
Dean returned from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The store grew into a chain of 12 Internet and telephone
``lounges,'' spread across nine Australian cities. Visitors to any
of the communication centers can fax, phone, scan, rent a mailbox,
photocopy and send e-mail. Global Gossip's young owners are seeking
U.S.-based partners for global expansion.
</P>
<P>
   And Global Gossip isn't alone. As visitors to Australia for the
Olympics will find, they may be down under, but they won't have to
be out of touch. In the past three years, Sydney - the capital of
the Australian state of New South Wales and its most populated
city, with 3.7 million residents - has seen an explosion of
Internet cafes. As England, Israel and other countries have,
Australia has proved fertile ground for the spread of the cafes,
which are a big attraction to backpacking tourists.
</P>
<P>
   For them, e-mail is the preferred mode of communication. It's
less expensive than calling home (although some of the cafes offer
international calling amenities) and easier than postcards.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the 35,000 customers who pop into a Global
Gossip each week are between the ages of 18 and 29, according to
the site. Sixty percent are visitors from abroad. Local people
gravitate toward the faxing, photocopying and scanning services,
said Dean, who compared Global Gossip to a ``more fun'' Kinko's in
that regard. Australians with PCs at home also stop by, for the
social experience. ``There's atmosphere and energy,'' Dean said.
``People enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydney picked up e-cafe fever around 1997, when a few cafe
owners decided to perk up business by installing a smattering of
computers. When it soon became clear that the mouse pads were
getting more hits than the mocha, cybercafes began to be cloned in
every semi-inhabited corner of the Southern Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   A stroll around any urban neighborhood in Sydney bears out
Australia's affinity for the net. The cafes line the streets,
crammed with young people, their eyes glued to glowing screens,
fingers tapping frantically. Many cafes stay open past midnight.
And a number are located on the notorious Darlinghurst Road in the
Kings Cross section of Sydney - the central strip of the city's
red-light district (fairly safe as red-light districts go) and a
backpacker's main stomping ground for low-cost room and board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Australia seems kind of ahead in this area,'' said 37-year-old
Dr. Sally Harrison, from England, who is working in a local
hospital for a year. Her explanation for the phenomenon:
Australians are ``obsessed with the fact that they're cut off from
the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Some cafes subscribe to the all-Internet, no-hoopla approach.
Sydney's Eagles Internet cafe is a ``stock, standard Internet cafe
that offers peace and quiet,'' according to its manager, Micheal
O'Grady. ``We don't crowd our room out with lots of people, and
only have a maximum of 12 people at once. Plenty of space and
nothing to interrupt them. It keeps them coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Competition, however, has made many cafe operators less spartan
about services offered, resulting in creative price arrangements
for jaded customers.
</P>
<P>
   Global Gossip offers patrons a stamp for each half hour they
spend online; those who collect five stamps receive a free
half-hour. Other cybercafes lure visitors in to check their e-mail,
offering the first two minutes free.
</P>
<P>
   The more experimental cafe owners have traveled beyond the
Internet in their quest for distinction.
</P>
<P>
   The 300-seat Fountain Cafe, on the edge of Kings Cross, offers
multitaskers access to one of 40 terminals in the downstairs
cybercafe, food and beer in the restaurant (the menu includes the
``Aussie burger with chips and soft drink and 1 hour on the Net''
for about $6 and salon services next door at the cafe's high-tech
beauty salon.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalind Turner, 43, an Australian freelance journalist, isn't
online at home, so she uses the Fountain's computers for the
Olympic stories she is working on. The cafe has ``lots of Swedish
accents, and lots of Irish and pommy accents,'' she noted.
(``Pommy'' is Australians' slang for the many Britons among them.)
``They know each other from the hostels.'' She likes the casualness
of the place. ``The owner lets people drink coffee and eat
hamburgers downstairs, so he's not really worried about greasy
fingers on the keyboards.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner appreciates the array of conveniences. ``I have a massage
every couple of weeks, I get a peel whenever I feel like it.''
After her massage she goes next door to the cafe, logs on and
checks her e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics are also getting in on the action. The Athlete's
Village will have a cybercafe - the Surf Shack - where the athletes
can respond to fans' e-mail as part of IBM's FanMail program.
``FanMail is a Web site we debuted in 1996 at the Atlanta Games,''
said Joyce Lagas, a communications employee with IBM's Olympic
project. ``It lets people from around the world send good luck and
congratulations to the athletes.'' The site is at
www.ibm.com/fanmail.
</P>
<P>
   IBM is also opening a Surf Shack for public consumption, which
will be floating on a barge in Sydney's Darling Harbor. People can
stop by to send e-mail to their favorite athletes, view the
Olympics Web site (www.olympics.com) and check out IBM technology
that was created for the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Olympic Village Surf Shack's official opening was
last Saturday, Lagas observed that team trainers, coaches and
officials had already been dropping in for weeks to e-mail their
families back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in 1996, the Internet was in its infancy, but still we
received over 100,000 e-mails for the athletes at the Atlanta
Games,'' Lagas said. ``Two years later, at the Nagano Games - and
winter Games tend to be smaller, with fewer athletes - we had
300,000 messages sent from 126 countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Will the ultradisciplined athletes succumb to the lure of the
Internet cafe? IBM thinks so. True, the 3,800-square-foot Athlete's
Village Surf Shack with more than 60 computers will serve no food.
But ``they can play computer games here,'' Lagas said, ``and we
also have a giant video wall set up,'' with a feed from the events
once the Games start.

   The Way of the Bunchberry
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have tried many times to transplant bunchberry (Cornus
canadensis), to no avail. Now I have found some plants with red
berries. Will they contain seeds I can plant? Is this the right
time to pick them, and what are my chances of success?
</P>
<P>
   A. Collecting wildflower seed is much less destructive of native
stands than the gathering of plants, and in the case of
bunchberries it's also more likely to lead to success, said Cheryl
Lowe, horticultural director of the New England Wild Flower
Society, in Framingham, Mass. The society has had a lot of
experience with these lovely little plants, which, at about 6
inches tall, are the shortest native dogwoods. Lowe recommends the
following method of propagation.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, gather the berries as soon as they are soft and part
readily from the plant. Crush them lightly. Then cover with cool
water and soak them for a week or so to loosen the clinging pulp.
Strain, and then work the mush between your fingers to free the
seeds. Rinse them.
</P>
<P>
   Fill a planting flat with sterile potting mixture and plant the
seeds 1/2 to 3/4 inch deep, 2 inches apart in all directions. Water
thoroughly from the bottom. Choose a partly shaded spot outdoors
and sink the flat so the top is level with the soil surface. Cover
with a porous plant cover like Reemay, to keep animals out and
prevent splashing. Leave for the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Start checking for seedlings in early spring and remove the
cover when they appear. When they have four leaves, transplant to a
flat filled with potting soil that has been mixed with a small
amount of aged bark. Sink the new flat as you did the old one. Keep
the little plants moist but not wet.
</P>
<P>
   Leave them in the nursery flat for another year; then transplant
to their final location, which should be partly shaded, cool and
damp. Remember that bunchberries thrive in Greenland and will do
best where chilly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farther north you go, the better they do,'' Lowe said.
``They really don't like hot, humid summers. Our best spot here is
a north facing slope where a seeping spring keeps the ground cool
all summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The New England Wild Flower Society sells bunchberry seeds; it
is at 180 Hemenway Road, Framingham, Mass. 01701; (508) 877-7630.
Plants are available from Fieldstone Gardens, 620 Quaker Lane,
Vassalboro, Maine 04989 (207) 923-3836; both catalogs are $2.50.
</P>
<P>
   Tomatoes Need Another Home
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have been planting tomatoes for seven years. Every year,
they grow well and yield a nice output of fruit. Then, around Aug.
1, the leaves turn yellow, starting at the bottom and moving up the
plants, which die in a few weeks. I have been told that the cause
is the acidity of the soil. I have applied lime in substantial
quantities, but this year the same thing happened.
</P>
<P>
   A. Northeastern soils are usually on the acid side, and adding
lime to prevent them from becoming too acidic is an old farming
tradition. But adding large amounts of lime - or any other mineral
- without knowing whether you really need it can do more harm than
good. It's always best to get a soil analysis before taking action.
</P>
<P>
   Soil analysis can be done by the nearest agricultural extension
service, which may be listed in the phone book under Extension or
Cooperative Extension, under the name of the state university or
with county offices. The extension office will explain how to
gather and send the sample. In most states, you can also send a
dead leaf or two and get an expert autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting for the results, think about planting next year's
tomatoes somewhere tomatoes have never grown. It's likely the
service will tell you that your problem is not acidity but rather a
fungus disease like early blight (alternaria) or fusarium wilt.
These diseases are widespread, and once they get into the soil they
stay there for years.
</P>

   BANGLADESH _ Nearly a week after being battered by tidal waves,
35,000 displaced residents of an island in Bangladesh are still
waiting for aid to pour in. Zubair Hussain, a software engineer in
Atlanta who is helping with the relief efforts there, believes no
help is forthcoming; Bangladesh's annual call for humanitarian aid

   BAXTER-BUSH _ Although some of his other recent miscues are
getting most of the attention, George Bush has allowed the terms of
the presidential debate to be defined in ways that are playing to
the traditional strength of his opponent's party. (Baxter, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   WEATHER-LATIN _ From offices in Atlanta, the weather is
broadcast all over Latin America, using on-air personalities hired
from those countries. We take a look at the Weather Channel/Latin
America, at the challenges it has faced in getting people in Latin
America used to relying on forecasts, and the community of
Hispanics and Brazilians who are pioneering this effort. (Melvin,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) W/PHOTOS
</P>
<P>
   LESBIAN-MARRIAGE _ Two lesbians from Houston who have tried
unsuccessfully to marry in their hometown will get a marriage
license in San Antonio today despite a Texas law prohibiting
same-sex marriages. How did they get the county clerk to agree? One
of the women used to be a man. And according to a recent lower
court ruling, marriages between folks who were born of opposite
sexes are legal. The couple say they are using their marriage, in
part, to show they think the earlier court ruling _ which
invalidated a marriage of a woman who was surgically changed from a
man _ was absurd. We look at the social ramifications of this
unusual Texas marriage. (Kurtz, Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS _ WASHINGTON _ In a sign of trouble ahead in
end-of-session negotiations between congressional leaders and
President Clinton, House Republicans led by Conference Chairman
J.C. Watts, R-Okla., declined to support an end-of-session
compromise offered by Speaker Dennis Hastert to pair a minimum wage
increase sought by Clinton with tax cuts sought by Republicans.

   WWII-MEMORIAL _ WASHINGTON _ Opponents of the proposed World War
II Memorial gained an influential ally Wednesday when the Advisory

national study that shows rapid increases in the buying power of
Hispanics and Asians in Georgia and other states in the Southeast.
Only 2-3 states had more rapid increases in buying power than
Georgia. Why? An ever-hungry economy that absorbs workers as soon

</P>
<P>
   LODIGAN _ Lodgian Chief Executive Robert Coles tells a financial
publication that he is ``cautiously optimistic'' that a sale of the
company will be completed in a couple of months. But William Yung,
the company's largest shareholders, said it's just a ruse to run
the stock price up. What Cole really needs to do, says Yung, is to
resign. (Poole, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   IRS - The Internal Revenue Service as part of its efforts to
streamline the agency and make it more consumer friendly is
breaking its operations into four operating divisions. The
650-person Wage and Investment division, which handles individual
tax returns for single and married filers, will be headquartered in
Atlanta. (Peralte, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   IXL _ IXL and its competitors are all experiencing a stock price
slide as their market dries up. The venture capital and IPO stream
for their potential dot-com clients has been cut off, so those
customers are dormant. The big clients, that make up 80 percent of
IXL's business, are taking a wait and see attitude. IXL says it
will lay off people to cut costs and ride out the storm, but
analysts say that will come back to bite them in the bottom
because, ``iXL's most valuable assets walk out the door at 5 p.m.
every day.'' (Brister, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   AIRFARES _An American Express business travel cost survey
predicts continued increases in airfares, hotel rates and car
rental rates next year, although all in the single digits. High
demand for service, coupled with fuel price inflation, will drive
rate increases. The survey comes as oil prices near decade highs,
which could affect airfares. (Fonti, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   SHAW _ Shaw Industries, Inc. said that Warren Buffet's Berkshire
Hathaway, Inc. has offered to purchase between 80.1% and 86% of the
outstandimg shares of the company. Shaw Industries would continue
to be operated under its current management with the corporate
headquarters remaining in Dalton, Georgia. (Bond, Atlanta

   BELLSOUTH _ One of BellSouth's top-ranking women, brought in

fronts and more substantial buildings, here after filming ends, for
future projects and a tourist resort of sorts. The Austin City
Council may get involved. (Copelin, Austin American-Statesman)

   MAYBERRY-VS-NYC _ ATLANTA _ Atlanta City Councilman Michael
Bond's challenge that the city ``decide whether it's going to be
New York City or Mayberry'' raises some interesting questions.

and often high prices _ that's earning them a spot in even homes on
the right side of the track. ``Better plastics are available today,

   Just a couple of months prior to the March show, Van Dam was in

   FBO-MILEHIGH _ Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler has described
Denver's Mile High Stadium as the ``toughest place to play in the
NFL.'' Coach Dan Reeves has called it the ``greatest outdoor
stadium'' in the league. What makes Mile High so unique? Most of it
centers around the 80,000 fans that pack the facility each game and
the noise that they generate, making it difficult for opposing
players to hear themselves on the field. The Falcons have attempted
to simulate the noise level during practice this week, but Chandler
admits it's nearly impossible to match the noise level at Mile
High. (Winkeljohn, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In an effort to combat homophobia in classrooms
and hallways, students in Northern California schools are
organizing alliances of homosexual and straight teens.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 125 schools with such clubs at the outset of
this year, up from 40 two years ago, said Carolyn Laub, founder of
the Gay-Straight Alliance Network of Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, there are an estimated 700 such organizations.
</P>
<P>
   While schools in San Francisco have had services for gay
students for a decade, the presence of gay-straight alliances has
spawned opposition and controversy in conservative areas. In Orange
County, outside Los Angeles, students sued for the right of an
alliance to meet on a public school campus. After initial
opposition, the Orange County Unified School District accepted the
organization as a school group.
</P>
<P>
   School districts have been successfully sued for failing to
protect students perceived to be gay, and a new state law outlaws
discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the GSA Network's first-ever summer training
camp drew two dozen students from Northern California and the
Central Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Laub, at 26, was the resident adult, but she made sure the
students ran their own show.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was George Loomis, former honor roll student and
class president at Golden West High in Visalia, who embodies the
need for gay-straight alliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was forced out of school because of my sexuality,'' said
Loomis, 18, who lives in Fresno and is organizing a GSA network in
the Central Valley.
</P>
<P>
   He has filed a claim against the Visalia Unified School
District, and said his senior year was a living hell. He said he
was intimidated and that the teachers and administrators were
little help.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he had to take a graduate equivalency test instead of
graduating with his class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to try to prevent this from happening to other kids,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Laub said it often takes hard facts to get administrators to
acknowledge what gay students live with daily. Her own surveys in
four East Bay high schools revealed that half to three-quarters of
the students hear derogatory comments about homosexuals and
lesbians daily.
</P>
<P>
   At Bishop O'Dowd School, which is one of only five Oakland
schools with a gay-straight alliance, 60 percent of the boys and 30
percent of girls said they hear slurs often at school, and 73
percent of the students said they seldom or never hear teachers
intervene when such remarks are made.
</P>
<P>
   ``A GSA can help decrease it, but we need teacher trainings and
we need students to get educated,'' Laub said. ``We can make it not
PC to say, but we still have to make deeper changes.''

 &HT;    ADVISORY PANEL SAYS WWII MEMORIAL WRONG FOR NATIONAL MALL
 &HT;    450&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Opponents of the proposed World War II Memorial
gained an ally Wednesday as the Advisory Council on Historic
Preservation deemed the design inappropriate for its planned place
between the Lincoln Memorial and Washington Monument.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial, ``as now proposed, has serious and unresolved
adverse effects on the preeminent historic character of the
National Mall,'' the council wrote in a letter to Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt.
</P>
<P>
   The council, an independent federal agency that advises the
president and Congress, listed specific objections:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Memorial's overall scale and complexity create a tension
with the transcendent symbolic significance and fundamental
simplicity of the National Mall.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The ``visual screen'' of its 56 pillars ``violate the open
feeling of the Mall.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The memorial's lighting would alter the dusk and night views
of the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   The Council has only an advisory role, however, and no power to
halt the project, which has the blessing of President Clinton and
Congress as well as several other review boards. Ground-breaking is
scheduled for Veterans Day in November, with dedication planned for
Memorial Day in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, the project must win the approval of the U.S.
Commission on Fine Arts, the National Capital Planning Commission
and the Interior secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission on Fine Arts unanimously approved the memorial in
July. The National Capital Planning Commission, which has already
given its preliminary approval, has scheduled a final vote on Sept.
21. Then Babbitt will formally act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going before the National Capital Planning Commission
with confidence that we have the backing of America for this
project,'' said Mike Conley, a spokesman for the World War II
Memorial. ``This really has been a grassroots campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents countered that the preservation council has validated
their claims that the memorial would mar the majestic open space
between two of the nation's most historic and hallowed memorials.
</P>
<P>
   The council is ``the first entity to break the lockstep of
approval'' for this ``gargantuan obstruction,'' said Rep. Eleanor
Holmes Norton, the non-voting congressional delegate for the
District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   She demanded that Babbitt ``act on his commitment'' that the
World War II Memorial result in ``no unacceptable impact to the
historic properties'' nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball is in Secretary Babbitt's court,'' said Norton. ``I
expect him to do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Conley said he expects Babbitt to consider the recommendation
and to formally respond. However, he noted that the disapproval
represents ``a split decision'' in that the D.C. Historic
Preservation Review Board endorsed the site and design of the
memorial.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say World War II was the defining event of the 20th
century, and that a prominent spot on the National Mall is
appropriate for honoring what Tom Brokaw has termed ``the greatest
generation'' of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Led by former Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., and Tom Hanks, the star of
``Saving Private Ryan,'' organizers are raising $100 million from
private contributors to build the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Fredrich St. Florian, the memorial features two
semi-circles of 56 stone pillars with bronze wreaths, representing
the number of U.S. states and territories during the war. The
pillars surround a 7.4-acre sunken plaza and fountains in what is
now the Rainbow Pool.
</P>
<P>
   St. Florian says his original concept has been altered so that
the vista between Lincoln Memorial and Washington Monument was not
obstructed.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that World War II ended 55 years ago and its veterans are
dying at a rate of 1,000 a day, supporters are pressing to get the
project begun and completed. There are already fewer than 6 million
survivors of the 16 million American men and women who served in
uniform during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say they believe a World War II Memorial is warranted,
but not the proposed memorial at the proposed site.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial is not a ``done deal,'' said Judy Feldman, co-chair
of the National Coalition to Save Our Mall. ``Now is the time to
stop the World War II Memorial process and begin anew.''
</P>
<P>
   Norton said she believes President Clinton was ``bamboozled''
into supporting the project. She said Clinton wrongly ``assumed he
had all the facts'' when he expressed his approval.

&HT;     SENATOR WARNS THAT FBI'S CARNIVORE COULD SLOW INTERNET GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Orrin Hatch, chairman of the powerful
committee that oversees the FBI, warned Wednesday that the agency's
new computer program to police the Internet threatens to slow the
growth of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail-sniffing system, known as Carnivore, allows agents to
sift messages to and from a targeted suspect out of the full stream
of data flowing on an Internet service provider (ISP) such as
America Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individuals who use the Internet for personal communications,
purchases, and hobbies are justifiably reluctant to allow an
Orwellian Big Brother to monitor which sites they visit or what
messages they send through cyberspace,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, spoke at a
hearing by the panel on the Carnivore program, which has been
operating since early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The senator added that concerns about privacy remain ``one of
main impediments'' to consumers using the Internet commercially.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the committee's ranking minority
member, questioned the value of FBI assurances that agents sifting
through all e-mail traffic are looking only at messages to and from
criminal suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Such assurances are ``cold comfort to all other Internet users
who are not the subject of any court-ordered surveillance but
nonetheless are having their Internet messages automatically
screened by the Carnivore system,'' Leahy said.
</P>
<P>
   Once installed, Carnivore can monitor all e-mail on an ISP, from
people's lists of mail sent and received to the actual content of
the communications.
</P>
<P>
   The system differs from traditional wiretaps. In those cases,
the FBI first must get a court order to monitor the conversations
on a specific telephone. Then agents contact the phone company,
which installs the tap for that phone. When the investigation ends,
the phone company disconnects the wiretap.
</P>
<P>
   At no point in the investigation are law enforcement officials
able to monitor any conversations other than those on the one
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Carnivore system, the FBI also gets a court order to
use the agency's software to tap into the lines of an ISP. Unlike a
traditional wiretap that gives the FBI access to only one phone,
Carnivore has access to every message being sent along the ISP's
system. In addition, the ISP has no control over or knowledge of
what the FBI was monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Justice Department and FBI officials defended the
system, saying they are not seeking new capabilities in the online
world but are simply trying to preserve their ability to monitor
criminal activity. They said that capability is being eroded by
growing use of new technologies such as encryption, cell phones and
wireless message devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a criminal uses e-mail to send a kidnapping demand, to
buy and sell illegal drugs or to distribute child pornography, law
enforcement needs to know to whom he is sending the messages and
from whom he receives them,'' said Kevin V. DiGregory, a deputy
assistant attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   But James X. Dempsey, an attorney at the Center for Democracy
and Technology, a Washington-based Internet watchdog group, said
that only recently have consumers become aware of how much
sensitive information about their lives is transmitted and stored
electronically.
</P>
<P>
   ``As most people sense with growing unease, everywhere we go on
the Internet we leave digital fingerprints, which can be tracked by
marketers and government agencies alike,'' Dempsey said. ``That
knowledge has made many people question what they should do online
and what they should do in the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   He warned that unless these consumer fears are addressed, more
and more people will curtail their use of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But Donald M. Kerr, an assistant director of the FBI, said the
public has ``nothing to fear'' with the Carnivore system. In fact,
he said, consumers should feel ``more safe'' on the Internet
because of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carnivore helps protect Internet users from cyber-criminals
who would otherwise be much more difficult to track down and
prosecute,'' he said. ``Without proper policing, these criminals
could prey on Internet users.''

&HT;    FINDING MR. RIGHT WITH A BRITISH ACCENT QL
</HEADLINE>
 QL  By HELEN KIRWAN-TAYLOR QC 
 &HT;    c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service QC 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON - Ever since Madonna landed the hunky British director Guy
Ritchie and declared Britain her second home, the English tabloids have
been full of self-congratulatory prose. It's their metaphorical way of
kicking sand in the face of the single, commitment-minded American male,
who according to Time  magazine, is practically as rare a sighting as the
American osprey.
</P>
<P>
   Anglo-American romances are hardly news. Britain has long been home
for American women. From turn-of-the-century American heiresses like Jennie
Jerome (Lady Randolph Churchill, mother of Winston) and Consuelo Vanderbilt
(married off to the Ninth  Duke of Marlborough) to the late Linda
McCartney, Jerry Hall and now Candace Bushnell, American women have long
been irresistible to English men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like them,'' Albert, Prince of Wales, said once, adding: ``They
are livelier, better educated and less hampered by etiquette. They are not
as squeamish as their English sisters and they are better able to take care
of   themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert, who in 1901 became King Edward VII, chose a Dane for his own
bride, but by the end of the Edwardian era, well over 100 Anglo-American
alliances had been concluded, and his grandson famously gave up the throne
for an American from Baltimore. In those days it was often a
straightforward business deal: He had class, she had cash.
</P>
<P>
   Today, I think the British male represents something that has gone
missing from his American counterpart: chivalry. Speaking as an expat
married to an Englishman, I've observed that my husband, Charlie, picks up
the tab for any single woman who joins us in a restaurant. He gets up when
my mother walks into the room and he still writes thank you notes. He also
has something else lost amongst my compatriots: mystery. Britain is now as
self-obsessed as America, but fortunately the tendency to bare it all (in
public and elsewhere) has yet to afflict the male population.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Americans and British are attracted to each other because
opposites attract,'' said Alfred Munkenbeck, an American architect living
in London with his Irish-born wife, Paula Reed, an editor at Conde Nast
Traveler.  In America, you can afford to be an extrovert. ``There's this
sense of space: you can always move somewhere else if you screw up,''  he
said. ``The British have this exaggerated politeness, very much like the
Japanese, because it's a tiny island. Everyone's terrified of sticking out.
Americans think: `How can they be so reserved?'''
</P>
<P>
   Hence, many American women find the British male to be the ultimate
challenge. ``I think American women are like sniffer dogs trying to pin
them down,'' said Cherie Phillips, an American consultant for  Sotheby's
married to a Scottish real estate executive. ``There are layers and layers
of gray to wade through.''
    For Stephanie Cabot, an American literary agent, it was her English
husband's subtlety that attracted her. ``The Englishman's approach is just
not fully fronted like ours,''  she said. ``It's layered, but what you get
out of it is nuance and subtext.''
</P>
<P>
   Where I live in Notting Hill, Anglo-American alliances are
practically as numerous as the Mercedes station wagons parked outside.
Geordie Grieg, the editor of The Tatler, who is  married to a Texan, and
Peter Soros (George Soros' nephew), who is married to the aristocratic
British writer Flora Fraser, live within 200 feet of each other. Monty
Python's John Cleese and his American psychotherapist wife, Alice Faye,
live nearby, as does Tricia Guild,  the founder of Designers Guild, and her
American restaurateur husband. The list goes on and on: Martin Amis and
his wife, the New York real-estate heiress and writer Isabel Fonseca, and
Charles and Kay Saatchi of art and advertising fame. Then, there are the
American model-makes-good stories such as that of Lili Maltese, married to
the party-loving aristocrat Henry Dent-Brocklehurst, Liz Hurley's great
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Once attached or married to a Briton, Americans seem to cut through
most of the social and professional barricades, sometimes reinventing
themselves on the way (just as the British all seem to have titles in
America, all Americans seem to have trust funds over here).
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, a fair share of Americans pretending to be
English (Madonna has been accused of affecting a slightly British accent
since she hooked up with Guy Ritchie). Annie Wentworth-Stanley, a popular
hostess, prided herself on being ``Jo Average from Connecticut'' when she
met her husband, Adrian, in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really scared, because everyone in the U.S. said the English
are stuffy chauvinists that think the women's place is in the home,'' she
said. ``My upbringing taught me to be independent and get on with my own
abilities.  In fact, I think Adrian was attracted to me because I hadn't
dropped out of a secretarial course or cooking school like so many of the
upper class English girls. I was earning more than he was when we were
dating.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, an independent American woman  can put British guys on the
defensive.  ``American women are either terrifyingly intrusive and
intense,'' said Nick Horley, 38, a single British dot-comer. ``Or they're
lifeless corporate lackeys who think we have no work ethic because we only
work 60 hours a week.''
</P>
<P>
   American men can be just as off-putting, he added, recalling an evening
out when a New York banker suddenly joined the dot-comer and his pals,
without being asked. It's that golden retriever, all-American bonhomie
that gets a Londoner's hackles up. ``A Brit would never have done that,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The American expat's life with a Londoner - though it can be initially
difficult and lonely - is often fantastically successful.  Americans may
have a reputation for overheating their houses and terrorizing members of
the service sector, but they get things done the British can only dream of.
They get   their children into plum schools, their names appear on
fashionable charity committees, and they own some of best real estate in
London.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hayes, whose company builds race cars for the Grand Prix, moved
his wife, Hilary, from New York to Britain and plunked her in the deepest
of the Oxfordshire countryside - ``the sticks,'' as she puts it (heaven to
the English). When a leading real estate agent couldn't find them a house,
``Hilary picked up the phone and called the estate agent,'' her husband
recalled. ``She said, `Do you have a memory on your phone?' He said yes.
She said `Every morning I want you to press my number when you have coffee.
I don't want you to tell me what's on the market; I want you to tell me
what's going to be on the market.' It was the same story with the builders.
Hilary would explain  exactly what a real closet looks like and how they
should build it. They  didn't know whether to laugh or cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Candace Bushnell will soon find out, life over here is not
one endless round of  parties. True acceptance may take 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Cindy and I first got together, she said, `You're not going to
believe the anti-Americanism in England,''' said  Anthony Holden, a writer
married to Cindy Blake, an American. ``I said, `Don't be ridiculous.'  But
it's true; even in the most  liberal households of Hampstead you hear this
cultural snobbism that can be as bad as anti-Semitism. They'll be trashing
American television and novels, and Cindy will be sitting right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Britons are resentful of American intrusion in their culture, language,
television and food products, said Robert Worcester, the director of MORI,
Britain's leading polling agency. ``They feel we are de-Briticizing Great
Britain and mongrelizing British life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends'' and ``Frasier,'' for example: the British either love
them or hate them. ``Sex and the City,'' which  most of the British men
don't get - they find the women sexually terrifying -  is pure nostalgia
for us ex-single New Yorkers because life here couldn't be more different.
Instead of the sunny, fun-filled Hamptons, we have cold, wet weekends of
standing by your man in the depths of Sussex as he shoots - and misses -
poor, defenseless pheasants  (women are invited to accompany men on one
``drive'').  British twentysomethings may hang out at the Pharmacy every
night, but the thirtysomethings I know stay home, giving the odd dinner
party with four weeks' notice. My  Manolos mostly gather dust in the
closet: dressing to kill is not done here.   Showing off in any way is
frowned upon in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's the upside?
</P>
<P>
   For one, the British men - at least the ones I know -  tend to be
faithful; they have a real sense of duty.  Fourteen years of same-sex
public schooling prevents them from learning too much about the opposite
sex; as a result, they treat it with cautious respect. Neil Mendoza, a
co-founder of Forward Publishing, who is  married to Emilia Mendoza, an
American designer, said: ``We're so awkward and shy, but Americans don't
know that. English   women do, of course. Americans imbue us with a false
sense of confidence.   The truth is concealed until it's too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Adorable as the British male may be, he's almost impossible to meet
here, though personal ads are slowly catching on. Even The Financial Times,
that bastion of serious British journalism, now has a lonely-hearts column
(the main attribute that the British male seems to be looking for is GSOH:
Good Sense of Humor). But most of the Anglo-American relationships I know
started in New York (including Bushnell's; she met Stephen Morris at Rao's,
the East Harlem restaurant). My husband, along with a dozen other young
Oxford graduates, first went to New York on the Morgan Guaranty training
program and came home  years later (as did many of his friends) with an
American fiancee. So, maybe Mr. Big is - as my rear view mirror says -

GORE EXPLAINS HOW HE WOULD SPEND BUDGET SURPLUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Al Gore Wednesday proposed seeing the $4.56 trillion
federal budget surplus expected over the next decade not so much as
cash in a piggy bank, but a means for achieving 10 national goals,
including increasing personal income and savings while reducing
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at Cleveland State University, as well as a 191-page
annotated booklet distributed by his campaign and posted on the
Internet, the vice president also tried to distinguish himself from
the Republican presidential contender, George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore accused Bush of avoiding details and practicing
``cross-your-fingers economics'' as he talks about tax cuts, Social
Security reform, rebuilding the military, and other priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat's book, titled ``Prosperity for America's
Families,'' included a description of all the programs and tax
incentives he has already unveiled in his campaign. It added an
accounting showing he could pay for them _ and establish a $300
billion ``rainy day'' fund as well _ without exceeding the
projected surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want you to have to read the tea leaves, or read
between the lines of a press release or position paper, to know
what a Gore-Lieberman administration would mean to families,'' Gore
told an audience of several hundred students, faculty members, and
invited guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead, you can just read my plan,'' the vice president
added.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campain said the Texas governor has already released
his own budget details and submitted them to the nonpartisan Joint
Committee on Taxation for analysis. By contrast, they said Gore's
``laundry list'' of proposals would exceed the surplus by as much
as $906 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore's 200-page budget is written in red ink,'' said Bush
spokesman Dan Bartlett. ``Al Gore's laundry list of Washington
spending programs will lead to a $900 billion budget deficit, and
his tax plan will force families to hire lawyers and accountants to
determine whether they are one of the lucky few who get targeted
tax relief.''
</P>
<P>
   To bolster its claim, the Bush campaign took out a half-page ad
in USA Today, in which six winners of the Nobel prize for economics
and dozens of economists endorsed Bush's spending plan. ``It is
based on conservative revenue projections and sensible spending
baselines and will create more economic growth and greater
opportunities for all Americans,'' the economists said.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of Gore's economic plan is his proposal to pay off
the nation's $3.4 trillion national debt by 2012. The vice
president proposes paying down $3 trillion of the debt in the next
10 years with $2.3 trillion in surplus Social Security taxes, $450
billion in surplus Medicare taxes, and the $300 billion rainy-day
fund if it is not needed for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's other goals include: doubling the number of
families with $50,000 in savings and investments accounts, from
one-third of US families to two-thirds of them; raising the median
family income over a decade by one-third, or from about $50,000 to
$67,000 annually; increasing home ownership to 70 percent of
American families, up from about 67.2 percent currently; and
reducing the number of people in poverty to 10 percent from about
12 percent currently.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he could achieve those aims with spending proposals he
has already announced, all of which would be paid for with the
expected surpluses. For example, the book says incomes could be
increased with the vice president's proposed spending on biomedical
research, computer technology, and through increased foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of increasing savings could be achieved with Gore's
idea to have the government match personal savings up to $2,000.
The vice president has also proposed expanding the Earned Income
Tax Credit, which the book said would help reduce poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign staffers conceded that some of Gore's goals could be
achieved only if optimistic results are attained. For example,
under no 10-year period in US history has personal income increased
by one-third, as Gore hopes, said one budget adviser, who briefed
reporters on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, however, exuded confidence during his speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``My plan wasn't built on the cross-your-fingers economics that
says we can give more to the people who already have the most, and
then just hope that the benefits trickle down to the middle
class,'' he said. ``The Gore-Lieberman economic plan has one
guiding purpose: to help the middle-class families who have always
been America's purpose and its pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Politically, Gore is trying to avoid the traditional
``tax-and-spend'' label hung on Democrats by focusing on his
debt-reduction and rainy-day proposals instead of his spending
ideas. In his speech, he portrayed the Republicans as spendthrifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other side believes it's OK to spend more than the entire
surplus and then hope the economy does far better than anyone
expects, so the numbers will somehow add up. Well, Joe Lieberman
and I have a very different approach. Today I am announcing that we
will underspend the surplus, rather than overpromise our way into
an economic hole,'' the vice president said.

   MEXICO-HUMANRIGHTS MEXICO CITY _ Pressure is mounting for
Mexican President-elect Vicente Fox to look into Mexico's record of
human rights abuses. Prompted by the recent arrest of an Argentine
here suspected of torture in his home country, a group of people
with ``disappeared'' family members have resurrected their own
fight for justice. They accuse high-ranking officials of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) of repressive acts over the
party's 71-year rule. Pressure is also on to review other cases _ a
peasant environmentalist and an Army colonel _ human rights group
believe are unjustly imprisoned now.

   RUSSIA-INTERNET MOSCOW _ Under a new law, every communications

the Federal Security Service, or FSB, to allow the intelligence
agency to monitor e-mail and Internet traffic by users. Not only
does the Internet provider have to allow the FSB access to their
network, but the companies have to pay for the installation and
training for these officers to do their dirty work. Human rights
organizations are up in arms, arguing it's a further sign that the
country has slipped back into a Soviet mode of control. (Coker, Cox

   ISRAEL-DEFENSE _ JERUSALEM _ In a country flush with military
bravado, it figures that Israeli tourist shops would offer an array
of army ball caps and fatigue T-shirts. ``America don't worry,''
quips one T-shirt around a drawing of an F-16 jet. ``Israel is
behind you.'' In truth, of course, it's the other way around.
American aid makes up about a quarter of Israel's defense budget,
including nearly half its equipment, comes free from America. But,
even as Israeli officials prepare to ask for increases in aid with
President Clinton's encouragement, some say that Israel's defense
dependence on American aid may be doing more harm than good. WAN:

   ISRAEL-USAID _ TEL AVIV _ Israel, which has a per capita income
greater and Greece and Spain, receives some $3 billion from the
United States annually _ about a quarter of the total U.S. aid
budget. With a possible Mideast peace on the horizon, that figure
could grow by billions more over the next decade. But should it?
Analysts, officials and American Israel backers see the aid as an
investment that reaps priceless returns. A growing number of that
same group are beginning to question Israel's reliance on American
largesse, however. (Kaplow, Cox News Service)

   CENSUS-ADJUST _ A federal lawsuit against the state of Virginia
is emerging as the all-important test case in the politically
charged issue of whether states next year can use raw census
results instead of statistically adjusted counts to redraw
legislative districts. A dozen major U.S. cities and counties have
joined the fight against a Virginia law passed this year by the
GOP-dominated legislature. Urban areas, with large minority
populations traditionally undercounted by the census, fear the
Virginia law will set a national precedent. (Holmes, Cox News

   ATTENTION EDITORS: Atlanta Journal Constitution reporter John
Blake has interviewed several men and women about growing up in the
1950s and '60s as children of the civil rights movement. The people
at the center of the struggle led dramatic, often dangerous, lives.
So, too, did their kids. The children of the movement _ the
offspring of black militants, nonviolent activists and even
segregationist leaders _ are now adults. They have followed many
roads in recent years. Some continue to carry on their parents'
work. Others want only to forget their childhood. Blake profiled
nine of them.

   CIVILRIGHTS-CHILDREN _ Ericka Brown-Abram thinks she had a
typical childhood. Her mother's friends were killed in police
shootouts. Her family lived under FBI surveillance. She was
constantly shadowed by a bodyguard, even when she ran after the
neighborhood ice cream truck. Brown, 30, the daughter of a Black
Panther Party leader, once thought there was nothing unusual about
growing up in a communal home and attending a grade school where
students read Mao Tse-Tung's Red Book. ``A lot of people had this
swashbuckling idea of the Panthers,'' she said. ``But when you're a
child it all seemed normal.'' Nothing was normal, though, about
growing up in the 1950s and '60s as a child of the civil rights
movement. The people at the center of the struggle led dramatic,
often dangerous, lives. So, too, did their kids. These children of
the movement _ the offspring of black militants, nonviolent
activists and even segregationist leaders _ are now adults. The
Children of the Movement have followed many roads in recent years.
Some continue to carry on their parents' work. Others want only to
forget their childhood. Here are the stories of eight of them.

   GLOBAL-WARMING _Arctic sea ice has thinned by 40 percent in the
last 30 years. This summer, there was open water at the North Pole.
From the Andes to the Alps, mountain glaciers are retreating. And
across North America, from the fire-scorched West to the
drought-parched Southeast, the last year of the millenium has given
millions a summer of discontent. As the signs of a warmer world
grow more apparent, there are some nagging new questions about ways
to prevent it. A new analysis by NASA physicist James Hansen, one
of the first scientists to sound the alarm over global warming 20
years ago, suggests that industrialized nations struggling to
implement a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions called for under
the proposed 1997 Kyoto Protocol, may be pursuing the wrong
villains in the global greenhouse mystery. (Toner, Atlanta

 &HT;    Atlantan makes plea for Bangladesh
 &HT;    By Saeed Ahmed
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Nearly a week after a 10-foot tidal surge battered
their homes and claimed 142 of their kin, residents of an island in
Bangladesh are still reeling.
</P>
<P>
   Relief has been slow in coming for Sandwip, an island off the
southern coast of Bangladesh, despite an international appeal by
the Red Cross for at least 600 tons of rice to feed the 35,000 who
are homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the island is still under 5 feet of saltwater; tube
wells are sunken and surface water is contaminated by waste. The
people of the island, huddled in makeshift shelters and school
buildings, face a deadly outbreak of dysentery and cholera _ unless
help arrives soon.
</P>
<P>
   But Zubair Hussain, an Atlanta software engineer who's helping
out with basic relief efforts in the island, doesn't believe it
will.
</P>
<P>
   Hussain says that for Bangladesh _ a nation that is deluged
every year by the monsoon rains _ such calls for assistance are
being increasingly met by donor passivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that if aid doesn't come soon, the impact will be
colossal,'' he said. ``But we also know how blase the donor
countries have become with our annual cry for help. So all we can
do now is simply wait and pray.''
</P>
<P>
   Hussain, however, is doing more than that. Having cut short his
vacation in the capital, Dhaka, to leave for Sandwip, he has now
started a modest e-mail campaign, offering firsthand accounts of
the displaced residents' plight and asking friends in the United
States to contact their Red Cross chapters with donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much that will help but every little bit
does,'' Hussain said. ``Some of the stories I e-mailed are quite
heart-wrenching and if they don't help impel giving by Bangladeshis
in the States for their own countrymen, that will probably be the
most heartbreaking of all.''
</P>
<P>
   People wishing to donate money to help with relief efforts in
Sandwip may contact the American Red Cross International Response
Fund at 1-800-HELP-NOW.

&HT;     GORE'S ECONOMIC PLAN DRAWS FIRE FROM BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Democrat Al Gore, taking a page from Bill Clinton's successful
1992 campaign, laid out a detailed blueprint Wednesday for ``a new
prosperity'' that promises 10 million new high tech jobs, expanded
home ownership, wider college attendance and a 33 percent boost in
family income over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, speaking in Cleveland, mimicked the cadence of former
President George Bush's 1988 anti-tax pledge to ``read my lips'' in
an appeal for Americans to ``read my plan'' for the details.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican George W. Bush's campaign scoffed at Gore's
191-page federal economic plan, dubbing it a hollow ``press
release'' that would ``bust the budget'' and force the $1.9
trillion-a-year federal government back to red ink spending.
</P>
<P>
   Bush summed up Gore's plan in his own words. ``It says `Send all
your money to Washington, and let me spend it for you,'' Bush said,
adding: ``And he can. Let me tell you, that man knows how to spend
money.''
</P>
<P>
   The presidential rivals' post-Labor Day battle over how to spend
the federal government's projected 10-year, $4.6 trillion budget
surplus came amid new disagreements over the timing and format of
the traditional campaign debates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who trails in the latest national poll, pressed his
challenge for Gore to join him for a joint hour-long campaign
appearance moderated by NBC News' Tim Russert next Tuesday. Bush
said he was ``showing up'' at the network studio in Washington,
D.C., whether Gore appeared or not.
</P>
<P>
   But NBC spokeswoman Barbara Levin threw cold water on that idea,
saying the network would not provide Bush a prime time platform
without Gore's participation.``We offered a debate, not an
appearance,'' Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign, citing Gore's agreement in principle to joint
appearances with the GOP nominee during earlier appearances on
interview programs hosted by Russert and CNN's Larry King, seized
upon the debate stalemate to launch a television ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't trust Al Gore on debates, why should we trust him
on anything?'' the ad declared. The Bush campaign said the ads were
rotated into an ongoing series of campaign ads appearing in
battleground states.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has agreed to take part in the three 90-minute presidential
campaign debates planned by the bipartisan commission that has
hosted debates since 1988. Bush has agreed to take part in one of
the three debates sponsored by the commission, and challenged Gore
to meet him for the two less formal encounters on television
interview programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to play games to try to substitute a talk show
for the national bipartisan commission debates,'' Gore declared as
he rejected Bush's latest challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Gore leads Bush 49 percent to 39 percent, according to the
latest nationwide survey, a poll of registered voters for Newsweek
magazine that was conducted after the Democratic convention and
published Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In other campaign developments:
</P>
<P>
   _ Gore made gains on Bush in the state-by-state battle for the
270 electoral votes needed to win the White House, according to the
latest state-by-state surveys tracked by the National Journal's
political newsletter Hotline. The overview compiled Wednesday
showed Bush leading Gore in electoral votes, 279 to 221 with 38
electoral votes unassigned. Bush led Gore last week, 314 to 163
with 61 electoral votes unassigned.
</P>
<P>
   __Gore rebounded from an 11 percentage point deficit in early
July to edge ahead of Bush in the bellwether state of Missouri,
according to a survey published by the Kansas City Star. Gore led
Bush, 45 percent to 41 percent in a Mason-Dixon survey of likely
voters that had a margin of error of 4 percentage points. Missouri
has gone for the winner in every presidential election since 1960.
</P>
<P>
   __ Gore's campaign eagerly awaited the hard-won endorsement of
leaders of the 1.5-million member Teamsters union, which had balked
because of Gore's support for free trade. Gore aides said they
expected to get the endorsement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In Cleveland, Gore said he was detailing his economic proposals
in excruciating detail so that American voters wouldn't have to
``read the tea leaves or read between the lines'' to know what a
Democratic administration ``would mean to families.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign manifesto, entitled ``Prosperity for America's
Families,'' outlined steps to pay off the nation's $5.6 trillion
public debt by 2012; target tax breaks to create 10 million new
high tech jobs; expand home ownership to 70 percent of American
families; hike family incomes by one-third over 10 years; and
provide tax breaks to encourage savings.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, continuing to claim the banner of a fiscal conservative,
called as well for a $300 billion ``rainy day'' reserve fund set
aside for emergencies from the projected $4.6 trillion federal
budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``My plan wasn't built on the cross-your-fingers economics that
says we can give more to the people who already have the most and
then just hope the benefits trickle down to the middle-class,''
Gore told his Cleveland audience.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's detailed campaign document recalled a successful tactic
of the Clinton-Gore campaign in 1992 when the Democrats' 232-page
compendium of campaign promises, ``Putting People First,'' helped
Democrats retake the White House for the first time since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Dan Bartlett dismissed Gore's economic
plan, saying it could overspend projected federal revenues by as
much as $906 billion. The Congressional Budget Office projects a
$4.6 trillion federal budget surplus over the next 10 years, with
Republicans and Democrats alike promising to set aside $2.4
trillion of that amount to bolster Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore's 200-page budget is written in red ink,'' Bartlett
contended, adding that Gore's package of ``targeted'' tax breaks
was so arcane that it will ``force families to hire lawyers and
accountants to determine whether they are one of the lucky few.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign touted the Texas governor's across-the-board
tax cut and competing federal budget blueprint by offering the
endorsement of six Nobel laureates and 294 other economists in a
full page newspaper ad published in editions of USA Today
distributed in St. Louis, three cities in Ohio, two cities in
Pennsylvania, Los Angeles and across Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The ad said that the Bush tax cut and spending plan was ``better
for working families and continued prosperity,'' adding that Bush's
plan to bolster Social Security, pay down the national debt,
provide $1.3 trillion in tax cuts and $475 billion in new spending
would ``create more economic growth and greater opportunities for
all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush told a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., that ``my plan has been
endorsed by Nobel prize winners; his plan has been endorsed by Bill
Clinton.``

<P>
   GOP vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney, campaigning in
Wilmington, Del., told John and Sherry Lierenz that the Bush-Cheney
tax plan would save their three-person family $1,200 a year in
federal taxes compared to a $100 saving offered by Gore's plan.
Cheney said the GOP proposal would provide tax breaks for
stay-at-home mothers.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic vice presidential running mate Joseph Lieberman,
a senator from Connecticut, tried to counter the GOP proposal by
telling an audience at Southwest Missouri State University that
Bush's budget plan would spend so much of the federal budget
surplus that it could encourage resumption of deficit spending _ a
step that could be ``a crushing blow for the financial markets and
cause tremors around the globe.''

 &HT;    Gospel truth? Winans needs helping hand
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It almost seems blasphemous to say anything less than laudatory
about one of contemporary gospel's best and most resonant voices.
But BeBe Winans gets by here with a whole lot of help from his
friends. (The exception being the uninspired team-up with
sophisticated crooners Joe and Brian McKnight on ``Coming Back
Home.'') Luckily, Stevie Wonder steps in two tracks later playing
the Hammond organ, harmonica and a selection from an album he
recorded at the height of his R&AMP;B career _ the 1973 single ``Jesus
Children of America.'' Then on ``Everyday,'' '80s singer Stephanie
Mills is as compelling as she ever was in ``The Wiz.''

   ``Dev'lish Mary''
</P>
<P>
   Hot Club of Cowtown.Hightone.16 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Hailing from Austin, the aptly named Hot Club of Cowtown keeps
on cranking out fine country music that simultaneously defies yet
draws upon tradition. ``Dev'lish Mary,'' the trio's third release,
mixes the usual _ western swing and traditional ballads _ with
styles rarely heard on country albums. ``Tchavolo Swing,'' heavy
with minor chords, sounds like a foot-stomper that the late Bob
Wills might have dreamed up during a Middle Eastern hootenanny.
Vocalist/violinist Elana Fremerman's background in classical and
world music is evident throughout ``Dev'lish Mary,'' but she stays
true to her Kansas roots, twanging it up in all the right spots.
And it doesn't hurt having premier Americana producer Lloyd Maines
at the helm, either. Hot Club of Cowtown's progressive
traditionalism flies in the face of modern Nashville's
cookie-cutter country, unabashedly embracing the past while boldly
setting new standards for alternative country's future.

   Michael White. Basin Street Records. 13 Tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The smile that clarinetist Michael White flashes on the cover of
this tribute album makes him appear at once mischievous, apologetic
and hopeful. It also invites you to come and explore White's
decidedly Dixieland jazz stylings. As a bandleader and arranger,
White's like a trustworthy friend leading you into terrain that's
both strange and familiar. Perhaps you've never heard the peppy
``Louisian-i-a'' before, but you'll surely imagine Ol' Louis doing
it . . . and better. But that tinny tune _ along with others
performed by White and his many accompanists (''Bugle Boy March,''
``What a Friend We Have in Jesus'') _ just attests to their
reverence for good songs, categories be damned. White's clarinet
captivates, as do the banjos and spoons and trombones, keys and
snare drums. The track in homage to the legend who first inspired
White to lick his chops is sentimental, but not sappy. And it
segues sweetly into the sassy ``St. Phillip Street Breakdown.''
Though produced by Grammy award winner Jerry Brock, everything
about this release _ and our most romantic images of New Orleans
jazzmen _ shrieks, ``Don't quit your day job!'' (In White's case,
that's as a professor at Xavier University.) At the same time, it
summons visions of a funeral parade for some Dixieland devotee who
died trying.

   There are several good songs on Gisselle's latest CD, including
the pounding opener, ``Te Voy Amar.'' This is the sixth outing for
the Puerto Rican merengue singer and the first to emphasize
ballads, which she handles very well, although the lyrics
themselves are not all that special. During the 1990s Gisselle, 30,
gained stardom with her strong vocals and fast-moving merengues. A
few songs on the new release, including ``Dime Luna'' and ``Que No
Diera,'' have cool tinges of gypsy rock, making them standouts. The
ballad ``Jurame'' is the best in the set. But the merengues don't
really distinguish themselves from what is already out there. They
are more like candy _ fun at first bite but not long-lasting.

 &HT;    Crisp to crazy, nurses' image runs the gamut
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Renee Zellweger's ``Nurse Betty'' isn't really a nurse, and she
doesn't play one on TV (well, not at first, but that's another
story). But she spends a lot of time in a pert-looking, nurselike
uniform, which set me thinking about the image of nurses in movies.
Mostly, it's leering soft-porn stuff like ``Student Nurses'' or
else anonymous angels in white who crisply fill in as moving
background in hospital movies. But there are some memorable nurses
who do more than empty bedpans. Here are a few to check out.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``A Farewell to Arms'': It may look a little creaky, having
been made in 1932, and it certainly wasn't Ernest Hemingway's
favorite, since the ambiguous ending changes the fate of one of the
major characters. Still, this adaptation of Hemingway's tragic love
story about an American ambulance driver (Gary Cooper) and a
British nurse (Helen Hayes) during World War I has an undeniable
romantic power. And it's twice as good (at least) and half as long
as the lush '50s remake starring Rock Hudson and Jennifer Jones.
The movie snagged four Oscar nominations (including best picture)
but won only two, for sound recording and cinematography. An
interesting casting footnote: The screenplay was originally written
with Fredric March and Claudette Colbert in mind.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'': From the saintly to the
monstrous ... Louise Fletcher's Big Nurse, aka Nurse Ratched, ruled
Jack Nicholson's psychiatric ward like the Florence Nightingale
from Hell. And she won a best actress Oscar for her efforts
(memorably accepting in sign language as a tribute to her deaf
parents). Nurse Ratched may have been a juicy role, but it wasn't
one that was easy to cast. Reportedly, everyone from Anne Bancroft
to Angela Lansbury turned it down. Then along came the little-known
Fletcher. In his memoir, director Milos Forman writes that when
Fletcher came for her interview, she was sweet and polite, with an
engaging smile. ``She was all wrong for Nurse Ratched, but there
was something about her. I asked her to read with me, and suddenly,
beneath the velvety exterior, I discovered a toughness and will
power that seemed tailored for the role.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``MASH'': The long-running TV series is so indelible that
sometimes it's easy to forget that those crazy cutups first
appeared in Robert Altman's hugely successful late-'60s comedy.
Donald Sutherland and Elliott Gould are the surgeons operating just
behind the front lines during the Korean War, though their antiwar
attitude and anti-establishment quips are far more redolent of the
then-raging Vietnam War (or at least as it was being fought over on
college campuses across the country). Their head nurse, Maj.
Margaret ``Hot Lips'' Houlihan, is played by Sally Kellerman, who
made her sexy as hell but also something of a pro-authority pain in
the butt. Kellerman later said that she had reservations when she
first discussed the role with her director. She told him, ``I don't
want to do this one-level, cold, rotten woman standing in the
background.'' He replied, ``This is just an outline and maybe a lot
of stuff can happen.'' It did _ enough to give Kellerman, a former
B-movie actress, a brief shot at the big time.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Sister Kenny'': This little-known film, based on the life of
an Australian nurse who battled for the treatment of infantile
paralysis, was a labor of love for star Rosalind Russell. Not only
did she spend time going to polio wards with the real sister
(that's British for nurse), but she battled for six years to get
the movie made. As she recalls in her autobiography, ``Crippled
children didn't sound like box office to the movie magnates.'' But
she persevered, and while the magnates were right _ the movie was a
commercial flop _ Russell got a Golden Globe award and an Oscar
nomination for her trouble.

 &HT;    A Stone-cold take on pro football
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oliver Stone takes on pro football's dark side _ pills, booze,
prostitutes, shady back-office deals _ and almost fumbles. The
jarring game visuals come at you nonstop. All hard hits and harder
cheerleader bodies. Al Pacino plays the coach of the fictional
Miami Sharks and argues constantly with young team co-owner Cameron
Diaz. Jamie Foxx plays a rising quarterback and emerges the best
actor in the large cast. (The video is a Special Edition Director's
Cut, a version of the film re-cut by Stone, with a running time
shorter than the theatrical release.)

 &HT;    Georgia writers gaining a hall of fame
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Georgia is the home of many famous writers, but until now there
has been no official recognition for the state's literary sons and
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Georgia Libraries has corrected that oversight
with the formation of the Georgia Writers Hall of Fame. This week,
the organization announced that 12 Georgians _ including Flannery
O'Connor, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Margaret Mitchell _
will be inaugural inductees.
</P>
<P>
   Others honored include Erskine Caldwell (``Tobacco Road''), Joel
Chandler Harris (``Uncle Remus, His Songs and His Sayings: Folklore
of the Old Plantation''), James Dickey (``Buckdancer's Choice,''
``Deliverance''), John Oliver Killens (``Youngblood''), Carson
McCullers (``The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter''), Lillian Smith
(``Strange Fruit''), Augustus Baldwin Longstreet (``Georgia
Scenes''), Sidney Lanier (``Song of the Chattahoochee'') and W.E.B.
Du Bois (``The Souls of Black Folk'').
</P>
<P>
   The authors will be inducted this year. Two additional writers
will be nominated annually. Georgians can cast their votes for
nominations for living or deceased writers by clicking on
www.libs.uga.edu/gawriters or by calling Skip Hulett at
706-542-7123. The Georgia Writers Hall of Fame is housed at the
University of Georgia's Hargrett Rare Books and Manuscripts Library
in Athens, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More lists: The New York Times is tinkering with its
best-seller list again. Barely a month after introducing its
children's list (presumably to bump the ``Harry Potter'' novels off
the adult list), the Times
</P>
<P>
   has divided the children's best sellers into three categories _
picture books, chapter books and paperbacks _ which will be
published in rotation. What this means is that ``Harry Potter'' is
nowhere to be found on Sunday's list. Instead, the top three
children's picture books are ``Wemberly Worried'' by Kevin Henkes,
``Oh, the Places You'll Go!'' by Dr. Seuss and ``How Do Dinosaurs
Say Good Night'' by Jane Yolen.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Music and memories: Singer Melissa Etheridge has signed a deal
with Villard Books to publish her memoir, ``The Truth Is ...'' next
summer. The book, which will focus on her life as an artist and
mother, also will include lyrics to her songs as well as other
writings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing `The Truth Is ...' has forced me to look deep inside
myself and visit my past in ways I've never really done before,''
Etheridge says. ``It may be a harder road, and others may not agree
with what you have to say (but) the truth is always better.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lit films: Anthony Hopkins has agreed to star in the film
version of Stephen King's ``Hearts in Atlantis.'' ... James Ellroy,
whose novel ``L.A. Confidential'' was made into a successful film,
will see another of his books on the big screen soon. Robert
Richardson, the cinematographer for ``Snow Falling on Cedars,''
will make his directorial debut with Ellroy's ``White Jazz.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the Northeast will awaken Thursday to another cool
morning as high pressure moves off the East Coast. It will turn
slightly warmer in the afternoon than in recent days, however, as
breezes from the southwest direct milder air north.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a decaying front will continue slipping south across
the southern Gulf Coast States accompanied by many showers and
thunderstorms. Some of the showers will produce brief bursts of
heavy rain. Cooler air will arrive over much of Texas, bringing an
end to the record-setting heat.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and isolated thunderstorms will develop along a cold
front crossing the northern Plains. Afternoon thunderstorms will
develop in the central and southern Rockies along the tail of the
same front. Elsewhere a strong area of low pressure will roll into
the Pacific Northwest, marked by gusty winds and showers.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: FADING HEAT WAVE
</P>
<P>
   Most major weather changes in the middle latitudes arrive from
the west driven by jet stream winds. But the great southern heat
wave of 2000 is ending from the east. Last week, cooler air spread
over the Carolinas and Georgia as a weak disturbance drifted very
slowly west from the Atlantic surrounded by clouds and showers. On
Wednesday, the 100-degree heat was quashed as far west as Texas
when the circulation around an expansive high-pressure zone near
the Great Lakes sent cooler air spilling southwest from Canada.  &QL;

UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS RESIGN IN DISPUTE OVER POLITICS AND ACADEMIC
FREEDOMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Two top officials at Hong Kong University resigned
on Wednesday after an investigation found that they and an adviser
to the territory's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, had pressured a
prominent pollster not to publish surveys critical of Tung.
</P>
<P>
   The vice-chancellor, Cheng Yiu-chung, and his deputy, Wong
Siu-lung, are the first casualties of a dispute that has riveted
this city for most of the summer, becoming a referendum on whether
Hong Kong's government has sought to stifle academic freedom since
the former British colony reverted to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The two men said they rejected the findings of the
investigation, which had been ordered by the university after the
pollster, Robert Chung, made the allegations in July. But they said
they would step down to avoid further damage to the institution.
</P>
<P>
   The report also implicated Tung's senior special adviser, Andrew
Lo. He refused to step down, saying he had not sought to intimidate
Chung. Lo has been stoutly defended by his boss, Tung.
</P>
<P>
   But with a drumbeat of discontent from students, academics and
opposition leaders here, analysts said Lo's future looked perilous.
Tung, a former shipping tycoon whose popularity has been battered
by the contretemps, may be forced to jettison one of his most
trusted advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is blood in the water,'' said Albert Cheng, a radio host
whose talk show has been flooded with angry calls about the affair.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has injected a combustible element into Hong Kong's
legislative elections, to be held Sunday. In the territory's first
post-colonial ballot, in 1998, voters were driven by fears that
China would curtail Hong Kong's freedoms. This time around,
analysts say, people are likely to signal their dissatisfaction
with their own Beijing-appointed leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scandal damages the credibility and image of the local
government, especially Mr. Tung and his advisers,'' said Tsang
Yok-sing, the chairman of the main pro-Beijing party, the
Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong. ``We are seen
as close to Mr. Tung, so we will suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tsang predicted that his party would lose at least one of the 24
seats in the Legislative Council, which are chosen through direct
elections. The other 36 seats are filled by an election committee
and indirect means that are designed to favor pro-business and
pro-Beijing interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong voters are not electing a government,'' said Martin
Lee, the chairman of the Democratic Party. ``They are electing
legislators, who are always going to be in opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For all the complaints about Hong Kong's stunted political
system, the polling dispute is fresh evidence that people here
guard their liberties zealously. Chung's allegation _ that the
university had threatened to ``dry up'' his funding if he did not
stop conducting polls on the popularity of Tung _ prompted a
blizzard of criticism and news coverage.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hong Kong University appointed an independent panel, headed by a
former High Court judge, to investigate the allegations. After 11
days of hearings, broadcast live on television, the panel last week
issued a damning report.
</P>
<P>
   It said that after a meeting between the vice-chancellor and
Tung's aide, the deputy vice-chancellor delivered a message to
Chung ``which was calculated to inhibit his right to academic
freedom.'' The panel described Tung's adviser, Lo, as a ``poor and
untruthful witness'' who gave a ``sanitized'' account of his role
to avoid the appearance of stifling academic freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The panel found no evidence that Lo had been ordered by Tung to
stop the polls. Tung declined to testify. But Chung and many others
here believe that the chief executive signaled his displeasure with
the surveys _ leading Lo to take matters into his own hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the issues in Hong Kong after the handover has been the
lack of transparency or accountability,'' said Michael DeGolyer,
head of the Hong Kong Transition Project, which measures public
attitudes in post-colonial Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, DeGolyer said the very public airing of the
dispute would have a salutary effect. Given Hong Kong's awkward
political situation as a semi-democratic oasis in a communist
country, he said, people here should be on a hair-trigger for any
potential threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the United States, if an adviser to the governor told a
university president, `why are you doing this?' it would be
conversation,'' said Ying Chan, director of the journalism and
media studies center at Hong Kong University. ``But this is a city
with a fear of political interference.''

KILLINGS OF U.N. WORKERS IN TIMOR MARS OPENING OF MILLENNIUM SUMMIT
MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ An armed mob stormed into a U.N. refugee office
in West Timor Wednesday, demolishing the office and beating to
death three unarmed U.N. workers, including an American, and
touching off repercussions of outrage at the Millennium Summit
meeting of world leaders here.
</P>
<P>
   The 149 assembled leaders included Indonesia's president,
Abdurrahman Wahid, who, embarrassed by the failure of his army and
police to prevent the rampage on the troubled island, said the
attack was the work of supporters of a militia leader who was
killed on Tuesday under mysterious circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid promised to send two military battalions to reassert
control in West Timor. But his words did not placate the fury at
the United Nations, which has seen 193 of its peacekeepers and
civilian workers killed in the line of duty since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council was preparing to discuss the attack, and
Secretary-General Kofi Annan moved a meeting with Wahid that had
been planned for later this week to Wednesday. Confronting Wahid
face-to-face, Annan condemned the incident and called the security
situation in West Timor unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tragedy underlines once again the dangers faced by
unarmed humanitarian workers serving the United Nations in conflict
or post-conflict situations,'' Annan earlier told the gathering of
world leaders in a scheduled address at the opening of the summit
meeting. ``The Security Council and I, myself, have repeatedly
expressed concern about the safety of United Nations personnel in
the field, both military and civilian.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan asked the assembled leaders to join him in observing a
minute of silence to honor ``those brave colleagues who have lost
their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The dead workers were identified as Carlos Caseras of the United
States, Samson Aregahegn of Ethiopia and Pero Simundza of Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.N. high commissioner for refugees, Sadako
Ogata, the refugee operation in Atambua was attacked after the
death of the militia leader. Though his death had no apparent
connection to the U.N. refugee effort, more than 1,000 supporters
brandishing automatic weapons looted and trashed the refugee
office, killed the three workers, burned vehicles and stole
equipment, including radios that the office relied upon to keep in
touch with other U.N. activities on the island.
</P>
<P>
   By evening, more than 40 employees of the U.N. refugee agency
and other international workers in Atambua had been evacuated by
helicopter to Dili, the capital of East Timor, under orders from
Ogata. Other U.N. workers were reported to still be hiding from the
mob. Fred Eckhard, the spokesman for the secretary-general,
declined to give further details, saying it might put their lives
at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Ogata called the attack the worst security incident her office
had witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   She said that she had brought up the attack during what she
called ``a kind of an encounter'' here with Wahid. She told
reporters that he had expressed feelings of mourning for the slain
workers and had said that one of the two battalions he dispatched
would arrive shortly in West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   But Ogata pointedly said after their meeting: ``I would like to
insist that the president of Indonesia implement security measures.
Words are not enough anymore. I want facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Ogata said the rest of the refugee workers in West Timor would
be evacuated on Thursday and would not return until their full
security was assured. ``It is an evacuation, not a withdrawal,''
she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The mayhem in Atambua mirrored the security problems encountered
by refugee workers in many places throughout the world, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a day of mourning for myself and the families'' of the
three murdered workers in West Timor, she said. ``I hope this
tragedy will open the eyes of the world leaders here, and if
changes take place, perhaps we will say it happened on the right
day.''
</P>
<P>
   The island of Timor was wracked by violence last year when
militiamen attacked residents of East Timor who had voted for
independence from Indonesia, killing some of them, razing homes and
sending nearly 300,000 fleeing for their safety to the western part
of the island. Nearly 170,000 East Timorese refugees have since
returned home, but up to 125,000 remain in West Timor, where
militia members have continued to prey upon them despite frequent
appeals from the United Nations and others for the Indonesian
government to intervene.

   BC-SCOUTS-GAYS-NYT (moved Monday, Aug. 28)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Monday, August 28
about a falloff in support for the Boy Scouts because of their
exclusion of gays misstated two cities' reactions to the ban.
Chicago no longer lets the Boy Scouts use parks, city buildings and
schools without charge. The public schools of San Francisco no
longer sponsor Scout recruitment drives or other programs during
school hours. The Scouts are not barred from using parks, schools
and other sites.
</P>
<P>
   The article also misstated the timing of those restrictions.
They began before the Supreme Court upheld the ban in June, not
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The article also cited one city erroneously among those that bar
the Scouts from their facilities. Although one San Jose elementary
school district, Alum Rock Union, does not permit recruiting or
other Scout programs during school hours, the ban is attributed to
demands on instructional time, not to the Scouts' policy.
</P>
<P>
   The article also misstated the number of United Way
organizations that have stopped raising funds for the Scouts. It is
about a dozen, not dozens.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the article misstated the Roman Catholic Church's
stance on the ordination of gays. Ordination requires a promise to
live a celibate life. While the church condemns homosexual
activity, it does not have a policy against ordaining gay men.

&HT;     MILITARY WEAKNESS IS AN OLD CAMPAIGN PHANTOM
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By HELEN THOMAS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When a presidential candidate finds his issues
aren't selling with the electorate, his ace in the hole is usually
to warn that the policies supported by the other party would weaken
national security.
</P>
<P>
   Both Republicans and Democrats have used that red flag
successfully in the past.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy hit pay dirt in the 1960 campaign when he
accused the Eisenhower-Nixon administration of allowing a missile
gap to develop at the height of the Cold War with the Soviet Union.
After Kennedy was elected, his advisers acknowledged that the
charge had no basis in reality.
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon B. Johnson attacked his GOP opponent, Sen. Barry
Goldwater of Arizona, in 1964 as trigger happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whose finger do you want on the (nuclear) button?'' Johnson
would ask the crowds at political rallies. Johnson further
demonized Goldwater by accusing him of ``wanting to lob one in the
men's room of the Kremlin.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Johnson also charged that Goldwater wanted to send
American boys to fight when Asian boys should be doing the job.
Imagine that. Johnson, of course, later became hopelessly mired in
the Vietnam War, so much so that he feared he could not win
reelection in 1968 and withdrew from the race.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan pulled out all the stops in his 1980 challenge to
President Jimmy Carter by charging there was a ``window of
vulnerability'' in the nation's defense as a result of Carter's
cutbacks in the various weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the Republican ticket of Texas Gov. George W. Bush and
former defense secretary Dick Cheney with an attack on the Clinton
administration's defense policies.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who was Pentagon chief under President George Bush,
contends the Clinton administration has undermined the military's
state of readiness with low pay, recruiting shortages, inadequate
training, and unreliable weapons. Cheney also claims morale is low
among the troops and that they are spread too thinly around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the draw down of U.S. forces began with the end of the
Cold War when Cheney was running the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   During his years at the Pentagon, Cheney created a blueprint for
the United States to be able to fight two wars simultaneously,
presumably against North Korea in the Pacific and in the Persian
Gulf. But out of office, he criticized President Clinton's
intervention in Haiti and other places but did not say when or
where he thought the United States should be involved militarily.
</P>
<P>
   But Cheney can't have it both ways. The United States cannot
simultaneously be the sole superpower of the world and leader of
nations and, at the same time, retreat from the world's
troublespots, especially when they involve genocide, as was the
case in Bosnia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, backed up by Defense Secretary William
Cohen, a Republican, rejected harsh criticism along the same line
from GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush, who claimed the
U.S. has two Army divisions unprepared for combat.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Gore are promising to increase their defense
budgets by billions if they are elected. That's par for the course.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, President Clinton has decided that the Pentagon hasn't
demonstrated that a new missile defense system is workable and he
is passing on the decision to his successor whether to go ahead
with construction of a missile shield.
</P>
<P>
   Changing world conditions require a constant U.S. reassessment
of the goals of so-called ``rogue states,'' now designated in less
menacing diplomatic jargon as `states of concern.'' The world is
changing and now rapprochement with even North Korea does not
appear too far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
   One voice of reason is Gen. George Joulwan, former head of
NATO's Supreme Allied Command, who said in an interview that what
is needed is ``clarity'' regarding the future role of the U.S.
armed forces in the 21st century. On that score, he said they must
be more versatile, flexible and mobile to be prepared for rapid
deployment.
</P>
<P>
   But more importantly, ``We have to talk more about conflict
resolution, how we work with the United Nations, what is the role
of a leader,'' meaning the United States, he explained.
</P>
<P>
   While at NATO, Joulwan arranged ``partnerships for peace''
relationships with 44 countries, including Russia, linking them to
the Atlantic Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   He boils down the military readiness issue to this hypothetical
question to Bush and Cheney: ``Ready to do what?''
</P>
<P>
   And I repeat my favorite question to presidents when, over the
years, they have thumped for bigger Pentagon budgets in peacetime:
``Who's the enemy?''

   The French banking group BNP Paribas, buoyed by its asset
management and retail banking business outside France, said
first-half operating income rose 24 percent, to 2.81 billion euros,
or $2.5 billion, from a pro forma 2.27 billion euros a year
earlier. The report combined first-half results for the first time
since the takeover of Paribas by Banque Nationale de Paris a year
ago. The combined bank's chairman, Michel Pebereau, sought to

PBS SERIES EXPLORES CHANGING ATTITUDES ABOUT THE END OF LIFE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MIKE McDANIEL 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
As a rule, we choose not to dwell on death, as if thinking or
talking about it might alter karma, betray faith or speed up our
own demise. But on those moments when we entertain the idea of the
inevitable, most of us reach the same conclusion: We don't want to
hurt.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Death be not painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest change in our attitudes toward death and dying has
come in the last few years in our own desire to have a good
death,'' said Bill Moyers, talking about his upcoming documentary
miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was born, before World War II and before penicillin,
the median age of death was 52, and death usually came very
swiftly,'' said the 66-year-old journalist. ``Today, the median age
of death is 76, and death comes very slowly, as the result,
usually, of chronic, progressive disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Baby boomers _ whom Moyers calls ``the biggest pig going through
the stomach of the American python'' _ have only lately begun
waking up to the fact that not only does death lie in wait, but
also an unhappy death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, 80 percent of us will die in a hospital or some
other institution outside of the home,'' Moyers said, and many of
those will die a ``slow and tortuous'' death.
</P>
<P>
   But what we would prefer, if asked, is ``a good death,''
painless and at home, surrounded by people we love.
</P>
<P>
   These circumstances sparked Moyers and his wife, Judith Davidson
Moyers, to make ``On Our Own Terms: Moyers on Dying'' (8-9:30 p.m.
CDT Sunday-Wednesday, PBS). The documentary miniseries takes the
stand that the time has come to change how we die in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be free of pain,'' Bill Moyers said. ``We want some
control over the circumstances, and we want emotional and spiritual
support.''
</P>
<P>
   The Moyerses, along with producers Elena Mannes and Gail
Pellett, traveled to hospitals, hospices and nursing homes across
the country _ from Florida to Oregon _ to document the stories of
doctors, nurses, hospice workers, families of the dying and the
dying themselves. Their work was edited down into a remarkably
compelling, six-hour series, divided into four 90-minute parts.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving a ``good death'' can be complicated. A major
impediment is the caregiver. Doctors have been trained that death
is failure, so they use heroic measures and the latest medical
technology to save and prolong lives _ often without considering
the quality of the lives being saved.
</P>
<P>
   But as the series points out, a third option _ palliative care,
which emphasizes comfort over care _ is slowly becoming more
available. The series also explores the issue of physician-assisted
suicides.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers, beware: ``On Our Own Terms'' confronts death head-on.
From time to time, we see dead people. And many of the people
interviewed for the series have subsequently died. But before their
final exits, they provide a noble and lasting service in
contributing their personal stories to this series.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there's Dr. Bill Bartholome, a Kansas City
pediatrician with cancer of the esophagus. Given six months to
live, Bartholome chose quality over quantity of life. Instead of
operations and aggressive treatments for his terminal disease, he
went home and surrounded himself with family, choosing to live in
what he called ``the light of death.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone in this series forgoes curative treatment. In
Miami, Dr. Pat Caralis confronts a population made up of Cubans,
Haitians, African-Americans, Asians and Jews, all of whom have
cultural differences with regards to death.
</P>
<P>
   At Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, Dr. Diane Meier
specializes in palliative care _ care emphasizing pain management
and comfort. Despite nine years of post-college medical training,
``I did not have a single lecture in pain management _ not one,''
she says. Her work has taught her that many of her colleagues don't
acknowledge pain as a relative symptom.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana, we meet veterinarian Jim Witcher, who is suffering
the progressive paralysis of Lou Gehrig's disease. His sad and
terrifying story is coupled (in Part 3 of the series) with that of
Kitty Rayl, an Oregon woman suffering from terminal cancer. The
difference between the two: Kitty lives in a state that allows
physician-assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   At the Balm of Gilead Project in Birmingham, Ala., Dr. Amos
Bailey oversees a program attempting to bring hospice and
palliative care to the working poor and the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   The video testimony of these and others make ``On Our Own
Terms'' extraordinary television, intimate and powerful. The series
is being packaged with a three-part, 30-minute series, ``With Eyes
Open.'' There will also be an hourlong local follow-up show at 9:30
p.m. Wednesday. And there's an extensive online component at
www.pbs.org/onourownterms.
</P>
<P>
   The Moyers' message is that change in the way we perceive and
handle death is upon us, and that it's up to us _ individually and
collectively, through personal intervention, public discourse and
change in public policy _ to be aware of our choices and to make
informed decisions so that when it is our turn, we can go out on
our own terms.
</P>
<P>
   It is a dutiful assignment, expertly realized.

HOW TO CREATE A SHORTAGE IN A SKILLED-LABOR MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   To alleviate apparent shortages of computer programmers,
President Clinton and Congress have agreed to raise a quota on
H-1Bs, the temporary visas for skilled foreigners. The annual limit
will go to 200,000 next year, up from 65,000 only three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The imported workers, most of whom come from India, are said to
be needed because American schools do not graduate enough young
people with science and math skills. Microsoft's chairman, Bill
Gates, and Intel's chairman, Andrew S. Grove, told Congress in June
that more visas were only a stopgap until education improved.
</P>
<P>
   But the crisis is a mirage. High-tech companies portray a
shortage, yet it is our memories that are short: Only yesterday
there was a glut of science and math graduates.
</P>
<P>
   The computer industry took advantage of that glut by reducing
wages. This discouraged youths from entering the field, creating
the temporary shortages of today. Now, taking advantage of a public
preconception that school failures have created the problem,
industry finds a ready audience for its demands to import workers.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times covered the earlier surplus extensively. In
1992, it reported that one in five college graduates had a job not
requiring a college degree. A 1995 article headlined ``Supply
Exceeds Demand for Ph.D.'s in Many Science Fields'' cited
nationwide unemployment of engineers, mathematicians and
scientists. ``Overproduction of Ph.D. degrees,'' it noted, ``seems
to be highest in computer science.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael S. Teitelbaum, a demographer who served as vice chairman
of the Commission on Immigration Reform, said in 1996 that there
was ``an employer's market'' for technology workers, partly because
of post-Cold War downsizing in aerospace.
</P>
<P>
   In fields with real labor scarcity, wages rise. Yet despite
accounts of dot-com entrepreneurs' becoming millionaires, trends in
computer technology pay do not confirm a need to import legions of
programmers.
</P>
<P>
   Salary offers to new college graduates in computer science
averaged $39,000 in 1986 and had declined by 1994 to $33,000 (in
constant dollars). The trend reversed only in the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The West Coast median salary for experienced software engineers
was $71,100 in 1999, up only 10 percent (in constant dollars) from
1990. This pay growth of about 1 percent a year suggests no labor
shortage.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Norman Matloff, a computer science professor at the
University of California, contends that high-tech companies create
artificial shortages by refusing to hire experienced programmers.
Many with technology degrees no longer work in the field. By age
50, fewer than half are still in the industry. Luring them back
requires higher pay.
</P>
<P>
   Industry spokesmen say older programmers with outdated skills
would take too long to retrain. But Matloff counters by saying that
when they urge more H-1B visas, lobbyists demonstrate a shortage by
pointing to vacancies lasting many months. Companies could train
older programmers in less time than it takes to process visas for
cheaper foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   Matloff says that in addition to the pay issue, the industry
rejects older workers because they will not work the long hours
typical at Silicon Valley companies with youthful ``singles''
styles. Imported labor, he argues, is only a way to avoid offering
better conditions to experienced programmers. H-1B workers, in
contrast, cannot demand higher pay: visas are revoked if workers
leave their sponsoring companies.
</P>
<P>
   As for young computer workers, the labor market has recently
tightened, with rising wages, because college students saw earlier
wage declines and stopped majoring in math and science. In 1996,
American colleges awarded 25,000 bachelor's degrees in computer
science, down from 42,000 in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is not that students suddenly lacked preparation. On
the contrary, high school course-taking in math and science,
including advanced placement, had climbed. Further, math scores
have risen; last year 24 percent of seniors who took the SAT scored
over 600 in math. But only 6 percent planned to major in computer
science, and many of these cannot get into college programs.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: colleges themselves have not yet adjusted to new
demand. In some places, computer science courses are so
oversubscribed that students must get on waiting lists as high
school juniors.
</P>
<P>
   With a time lag between student choice of majors and later job
quests, high schools and colleges cannot address short-term supply
and demand shifts for particular professions. Such shortages can be
erased only by raising wages to attract those with needed skills
who are now working in other fields _ or by importing low-paid
workers.
</P>
<P>
   For the longer term, rising wages can guide counselors to
encourage well-prepared students to major in computer science and
engineering, and colleges will adjust to rising demand. But more
H-1B immigrants can have a perverse effect, as their lower pay
signals young people to avoid this field in the future, keeping the
domestic supply artificially low.

   LARGE LCD MONITOR BUILT FOR WORK, NOT FUN
</P>
<P>
   There is one major drawback to conventional cathode ray tube
monitors: As the screen size expands so does the plastic box out
back. Flatter liquid crystal displays, which take up less desk
space, eliminate that problem.
</P>
<P>
   NEC-Mitsubishi Electronics Displays will soon begin shipping an
LCD monitor that, at 21.3 inches, approaches the size of the
largest, conventional monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Al Giazzon, vice president for marketing at NEC-Mitsubishi,
acknowledged that there were larger flat-panel displays based on
plasma display technology. But he added that although their
width-to-height display, like a movie screen's ratio of about
16-to-9, may be fine for watching the latest DVD films, it falls
short when it comes time to work again.
</P>
<P>
   That is because word processors and other software often use a
display format that works better with the 4-to-3 width to height
ratio that is the current standard for monitors. The NEC MultiSync
LCD2110 maintains the 4-to-3 ratio, which allows a more useful
viewing area, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, space-starved users may face another shortage:
Money. The LCD2110 sells for a staggering $7,999.
</P>
<P>
   Until the price drops, he said he expected the largest group of
buyers would be stock and commodity traders, whose thirst for
screen space is apparently unquenchable. It is quite common,
Giazzon said, for a single trader to sit in front of three or four
screens.
</P>
<P>
   NEW HIGH TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS NORMAL LANGUAGE
</P>
<P>
   Searching within Web sites is often just as frustrating as
searching the whole Web. Dead ends and unrelated links are common.
But a new technology that is being unveiled this week on the Public
Broadcasting Service's Web site hopes to change that.
</P>
<P>
   The new search technology is among the first to do a linguistic
analysis of a searcher's query instead of simply relying on
matching keywords with words in a document. ``You can now ask
questions the way you normally do, using your own words,'' said
Bruno Henry, chief executive of LexiQuest, the company that
developed the search technology.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Henry said, in the past when people typed something
like, ``I want to find information on myths in American culture,''
they were unlikely to get useful search results. The words of their
query were too vague and had multiple meanings. But with the new
technology, Henry said, that query would be read by software
trained to look for the context of the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Johnston, senior director of technology for PBS.org, said
expected the new technology would help to uncover ``a wealth of
content that is not uncovered by the typical user.'' And it will
solve another big problem too: It will forgive misspellings of a
keyword favorite: ``Antiques Roadshow.''
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT DEVICE SHOWS GAMERS JUST WHO'S TALKING THE TALK
</P>
<P>
   For online gamers, the ability to speak through the Internet to
other players while playing has obvious advantages. But it also has
the potential for trouble. ``If you're in the middle of a combat
game and you're strategizing with your team mate, it's important
not to let your opponents hear that,'' said Isabella Carniato,
Microsoft's Game Voice marketing manager.
</P>
<P>
   However, making those Internet voice connections and then
keeping track of who is hearing what can sometimes become as
complicated as determining the next step in destroying the enemy in
some cyber battle.
</P>
<P>
   While studying architecture and political science at the
University of Waterloo in Ontario, Carniato developed and marketed
one of the earliest pieces of software that allowed gamers to speak
as well as play over the Net. But now that Microsoft has taken over
Carniato's company that produced Battlefield Communicator and put
her on its payroll, she is now proposing that the next big thing
for gamers who chat is a piece of hardware.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem with software for managing voice connections is
invisibility, Carniato said. Most games don't make it practical to
show the on-screen displays of voice management software during
play. Given that, it becomes easy for players to quickly lose track
of exactly who's listening at any given moment.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft SideWinder Game Voice is a chunk of black plastic
that resembles an oversize hockey puck. When plugged in through a
computer's USB port, it acts something like an old-fashioned
telephone switchboard. Eight buttons on top of the device light up
to show live connections and allow users to quickly alter the
pattern of the hookups.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to several pieces of chat software, the device,
which costs $54.95, comes packaged with a headset microphone.
Because of that, Microsoft has also included voice recognition
software that allows users to operate most games with voice as well
as keyboard commands.
</P>
<P>
   But Carniato acknowledged that there are many situations where
pecking away at a keyboard will still be more convenient. ``You
would never say `shoot' or other commands that are right under your
fingers,'' she said. ``If you're just shooting until you run out of
rounds, it doesn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   THE VCR THAT PLAYS MOVIES BUT REJECTS JELLY SANDWICHES
</P>
<P>
   A videocassette recorder and a child can be a hazardous
combination _ for the VCR. The tape slot has been known to attract
foreign objects, including the occasional peanut butter and jelly
sandwich. Sony Electronics has introduced a new machine with a tape
slot that can be locked to keep wayward objects out.
</P>
<P>
   The new model, called the MovieTime and priced at $99, also has
a timer so that parents can limit the amount of tape viewing at one
sitting. For children who can't stand dead air, the machine
displays animation while a tape is being fast-forwarded or rewound.
One other parent-friendly feature: The ``Eject'' button locks so
even if Junior is sick of seeing that old Barney tape, he can't opt
out.

CONTRAPTIONS' HARDEST PUZZLE: HOW TO STOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By PETER OLAFSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a week immersed in ``Return of the Incredible Machine:
Contraptions,'' I found strange thoughts bubbling up in my head.
</P>
<P>
   After I noticed that I had left my computer on all night, I
wondered, fleetingly, if I could rig up a boxing glove on a spring
to hit the off button at an appointed hour. When I inadvertently
disabled an electrical socket in the bedroom and couldn't
immediately figure out how to turn it on again, it flickered
through my mind that if that had happened in the game, I would have
been able to restore power with a laser that matched the color of
the dead socket's faceplate.
</P>
<P>
   And when one of the cats solemnly presented me with its latest
catch from the backyard, it occurred to me in passing that the poor
mouse would have had a better chance reaching safety with the help
of some explosives.
</P>
<P>
   So absorbing is this puzzle game, the first new ``Incredible
Machine'' game in five years, that ruminations inspired by its more
than 250 graphical conundrums have been intruding regularly upon
the real world. I don't mind. It is a tribute to the game's homey
appeal and its challenge, as well as a signal that this celebrated
series has lost none of its ability to charm and infuriate.
</P>
<P>
   Like its five predecessors, ``Contraptions'' is inspired by the
ramshackle inventions of Rube Goldberg, a cartoonist, sculptor and
author who died in 1970 and is best known for his parodies of
mankind's attempts to build ever-more-elaborate mousetraps.
</P>
<P>
   In the game, you assemble makeshift machines from objects
ordinary (flashlights and magnifying glasses) and fantastic
(anti-gravity pads) to achieve mundane results. (A mouse reaches
its hole. A candle is lighted. Fireworks are launched.) These
ostensibly labor-saving devices are peculiarly labor intensive.
Balls drop to turn power on and off, start toasters and balance
teeter-totters. Lasers power electrical sockets and light candles.
A cat frightens a mouse, which runs in its cage on a wheel that
turns a fan belt, which sets another mechanism in motion. The
shortest distance between two points is never a straight line.
</P>
<P>
   In one puzzle, for instance, I was assigned to bop an animated
baboon on the head with a steel ball. This contraption kicked into
action when a ball, different from the one that would hit the
baboon, dropped onto a springy platform and started bouncing, going
higher each time. It finally caromed off an angled corner and hit a
pair of shears. The shears snapped closed, cutting a cord that
suspended a leaky can of paint above a detonator. The explosion
that resulted when the falling can pressed the detonator's plunger
blew out the bottom of a nearby bin, which freed a little boy
inside. He walked down a ramp and onto a teeter-totter, pushing one
side down onto the handle of an air pump. The blast of air set in
motion a pinwheel, a fan belt connected to the pinwheel, a
treadmill at the other end of the fan belt and a steel ball that
had been resting on the treadmill. The ball zipped off to the
right, where it clunked the innocent monkey.
</P>
<P>
   The baboon rubbed its head, not hurt in any serious way, and the
puzzle was complete. I'd meant to take a break here, but I started
the next puzzle instead. It was only a click away. Once you've
started playing ``Contraptions,'' it's awfully hard to stop. Since
you can use the included construction kit to create your own
puzzles and can import new ones created by other players, the game
needn't end.
</P>
<P>
   This particular puzzle was rated by the game as of medium
difficulty and seemed relatively easy. But as you progress through
the game, you increasingly find that the toolkit allotted to a
particular task appears to be a tool or two short. That's usually a
clue that one piece has to perform more than one function,
sometimes a function unrelated to its obvious purpose. For example,
on one level I found that pipe segments that accelerate whatever
passes through them were more effectively used when they were piled
up as steps so a ball could bounce down them. In that way, the
puzzles extend into the supplies you are given to solve a problem.
</P>
<P>
   And as they say in advertising, positioning is everything. You
not only have to select the correct tools to complete the gadget on
the screen, but you must also tweak their orientation or settings.
For example, you can adjust the clock on the egg timer for
situations that require time delays. And you must often put objects
in precisely the right spots to achieve the necessary end. Once you
hit the Start button to set the contraption in motion, you can't
intercede further.
</P>
<P>
   The creators, much to their credit, have not rendered
``Contraptions'' in three dimensions, as often happens with updates
of older games. An ``Incredible Machine'' reinvented as an
environment might raise the conceptual questions that ``Incredible
Machine'' as a game never raises. (Mine is not to question why;
mine is simply to enjoy myself.) The graphics are more detailed
than in previous games, but the game remains distinctly low tech
and straightforward. The familiarity of the household objects in
the toolkit, the small scale (each puzzle is confined to a single
screen) and the on-screen hints leave the impression of
manageability.
</P>
<P>
   But their execution is quite another matter. ``Contraptions''
can be utterly maddening. I must have spent hours staring into the
screen to figure out why a balloon steadfastly refused to float
through a hole I'd created with a rocket. That reverie was broken
only when the real world intruded upon the game world _ hot, heavy
breath on my thigh and a steady, long-lashed gaze from the largest
of my dogs told me that it was time for their dinner. I left the
game and made my way downstairs to the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   But on the way, I confess, I wondered how I could deliver food
into their dishes without leaving my chair.
</P>
<P>

Sierra for Windows 95, 98 and 2000 and MacOS 8.5.1; $29.95; for all
ages.

   BIZ-TO-BIZ BOOM: The number of companies doing business with
each other online should quadruple by 2004, according to a new
report from the Boston Consulting Group. The study predicts that
business-to-business e-commerce will hit $4.8 trillion in four
years, up from an estimated $1.2 trillion this year. Online
purchasing will account for 40 percent of transactions, according
to the study. About 11 percent of purchases will involve online

SOME YOUNG COMPUTER EXPERTS SAY NO TO COLLEGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Mo., Calif. Ala.)   (Circuits)  
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While his fellow seniors at Tiffin Columbian High School spent
last year preparing for college, John-Thomas Gaietto set his eyes
on heading straight to the pros. Distracted in school, Gaietto
focused his energy and extracurricular time honing his skills and
nurturing his natural gift.
</P>
<P>
   It may sound like the prototypical story of a talented athlete,
but this is the story of a computer geek.
</P>
<P>
   Gaietto, 18, who grew up in Tiffin, Ohio, is not an isolated
case. While it is difficult to pin down exact numbers, other
computer-adept high school students like him nationwide are
deciding to forgo college in favor of entering the red-hot
technology field. Computer jobs are plentiful, pay is solid, and,
those choosing to pass on school say, the industry is moving so
quickly that four years spent in college will be time spent falling
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why go learn something I already know?'' said Gaietto, who
works for Stone Computer in Royal Oak, Mo., setting up networks for
corporations. ``Everyone I know who is getting a four-year degree
is behind the times.''
</P>
<P>
   The students say skills that had caused them to be labeled as
geeks, even outcasts, in high school now bring validation and
healthy salaries _ sometimes even stock packages _ that enable
students not long from the prom to earn more than their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is giving you the positives of going to college,''
said Matthew G. Newell, the 20-year-old chief information officer
at a startup in Detroit. ``But when you look around, what you see
are the positives of making $80,000 a year.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Newell is making $35,000 a year, but he hopes to hit
it big if Service Advantage International, the company he helped
found that helps corporations track customer service, takes off.
Newell is enrolled at Eastern Michigan University, but to
accommodate the 50 hours a week he works, he has cut back his class
schedule to seven credits this semester. His theory: College will
always be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The university has been around for 150 years,'' he said
``It'll be around for another five if I want to finish my degree.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how many students are passing up college to
enter the computer field. Generally speaking, the percentage of
high school graduates attending college dropped to 63 percent in
1999 from 67 percent in 1997, according to census figures. Steve
Hipple, an economist for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said one
of the reasons may be the hot economy and its technology engine.
</P>
<P>
   The computer fields are growing at a torrid pace, according to
government figures. In the last decade, there has been a 17 percent
annual employment growth among computer systems analysts, a broad
category that includes network administrators, Web designers,
computer security professionals and computer scientists. That
compares with an overall employment growth of 1.5 percent annually
in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Salaries in computer-related fields reflect the demand for
workers that has accompanied this growth. According to the Census
Department's Current Population Survey, the median income in 1999
for computer systems analysts was $1,008 a week and $898 a week for
computer programmers. That compares with an overall median wage of
$550 a week, or $29,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not everyone is convinced that the lure of attractive
salaries should be the basis for deciding whether to pass on
college. Students who make this decision often face skepticism from
teachers and parents.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Coleman, Gaietto's mother, said she had ``mixed emotions''
about her son's decision to bypass college. Coleman, who is 42,
started college in 1977 but interrupted her education when she had
a family. She went back to college, receiving her degree in 1995,
in part to show her son the value of getting an education.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a phenomenal opportunity,'' Coleman said of her son's
current job, ``but I really would have liked to have seen him go to
college.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaietto's father, Michael J. Gaietto, who never attended
college, is more insistent. ``If you go up against someone in a job
interview who has less experience but a degree, chances are,
they'll get the job,'' he said. ``College degrees carry a lot of
weight, and when you're young you don't realize it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some studies support the contention that it pays in the long run
to earn a college degree. A study by the Census Bureau in 1994, the
last time the agency looked at the subject, estimated that in 1992,
the mean annual earnings for a person with a bachelor's degree was
$32,629, compared with $18,737 for a high school graduate and
$19,666 for a person with some college but no bachelor's degree.
</P>
<P>
   John-Thomas Gaietto said he had not given up on attending
college and said he was a few credits short of earning a two-year
technical degree. He said that he was earning ``between $30,000 and
$40,000'' a year and that he and a friend had made an offer to buy
a three-bedroom house that had an asking price of $136,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gaietto said he was being rewarded for skills that in high
school had made him ``stick out like a sore thumb.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always doing something that wasn't involved in class,''
he said. ``I was always doing something with computers.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment is typical among young people with computer
expertise who pass up college. Some say that they were terrible
students in high school, bored by the subject matter, or not
particularly well accepted socially, and that they found solace in
the technology field, which seems to them to be more of a
meritocracy and in which people are less judgmental about how an
employee dresses, the music he listens to or even about whether he
has an ``attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Corey Garnett, 20, who grew up in Lee's Summit, Mo., near Kansas
City, and graduated in 1998 with less than a 2.0 grade point
average from Lee's Summit High School, said he spent his high
school days hanging out on the Internet and learning about network
security. He worked at an amusement park after school, then spent a
semester at Blue River Community College before he concluded that
school was not for him and moved to California to look for work in
Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett works as a junior network administrator at Juniper
Networks in Sunnyvale, Calif., helping to set up a research and
development lab for engineers building new Internet routers,
hardware used to move data on the Internet. He makes about $50,000
a year, he said, and has stock options that were modest to start
with but have grown through stock splits to around $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   He is torn about having decided not to attend college. ``I think
I missed out on not going to college from the maturity level and
the social level, the lifelong friends,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``In this field, if you go to college, you're
outdated.''
</P>
<P>
   Such issues may soon confront Roman Yaker, a 17-year-old high
school junior from Birmingham, Ala. At the beginning of the summer,
Yaker took a job at Global Network Privacy, a computer security
firm in San Francisco, setting up secure e-commerce sites at a
salary of $40,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Yaker said he was a strong student and well rounded socially,
and he said he was still considering attending college. He said he
would like to attend the University of California at Berkeley, but
the decision might not be easy. He recently bought his first car, a
teal green 1995 Honda Civic, and said he expected significant
raises and more lucrative offers if he stayed in the working world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to work,'' he said, ``and if I go to college, I might
be missing out. People say the experience of college is great.''
Besides, he added, ``my parents would do practically anything to
get me to attend college.''

   Work and play have a wonderful way of merging on the Internet.
Take the prosaic corporate site. There is probably not much you can
do to liven up, say, North American Veeblefetzer: product pictures,
locations, corporate staff, how to order, shareholder information,
Our Founder, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are corporate sites that beg to be enjoyed, the
cyberspace equivalent of the time-traveling DeLorean in ``Back to
the Future.'' One essential element is a corporate history that
goes beyond nuts and bolts and shows an appreciation, nay, respect,
for the product's special place in modern culture, even if it
wasn't exactly what the company intended. Here are several that
meet that standard.
</P>
<P>
   Frank J. Zamboni &AMP; Co. of Paramount, Calif. (www.zamboni.com),
now in its 51st year, acknowledges the skating fans who have grown
to love its efficient, boxy ice-resurfacing machines, which have a
top speed of 9 mph, according to the trivia page. Oh, yes, a trivia
page. Also, an online Pro Shop offering shirts, jackets, coin banks
and _ this is truly inspired _ a pewter Zamboni Monopoly token.
</P>
<P>
   The Zamboni Story takes the reader back to the Iceland skating
rink in Paramount, built in 1939 by Zamboni and his brother,
Lawrence. It is still operating, the site notes. ``In fact, it's
not unusual to see Zambonis driving down the neighborhood streets
on their way to be tested at Iceland,'' the site says, suggesting
yet another Southern California tourist attraction. There are
pictures of early machines and the immortal No. 1, the Model A of
1949, which has been restored. Zamboni No. 2 caught the eye of
Sonja Henie, who bought it for her traveling ice show in 1950, and
immortality was on its way.
</P>
<P>
   The Makin' Ice page has a schematic showing how a Zamboni works.
There are snapshots showing Zambonis with Snoopy, at the Boston
Garden, at the Winter Olympics, in Japan and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   If you had to pick a single site devoted to the American fad, it
would be hard to top the Wham-O Inc. page (www.wham-o.com). Founded
in California by Arthur Melin and Richard Knerr, the company was
named for the sound made by its slingshot, and for a while in the
1950s and '60s, it was the Microsoft of novelty producers.
Frisbees. Hula Hoops. Superballs. Do-It-Yourself $119 fallout
shelters. Chubby Checker Limbo sets.
</P>
<P>
   Wham-O's history page is a hoot. When Melin traveled to Africa
in the 1960s, it says, he encountered a fish that laid its eggs in
the mud during the dry season; when the rains came, the eggs
hatched. The Web site says: ``Ah-ha, thought Melin. Sell chunks of
mud, add water, and voila, instant aquarium. Millions of dollars of
orders for Instant Fish were taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the fish brought back to America wouldn't mate,
so no fish eggs, no mud and the end of a great idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Frisbee has its own historical time line, starting in the 1920s,
when Yale students were throwing pie tins from Frisbie Pie Co. of
Bridgeport, Conn. There is a link to an article in Scientific
American magazine on the aerodynamics of the Frisbee.
</P>
<P>
   A private tribute site honoring the Superball, and not
affiliated with Wham-O, is www.superballs.com. It includes an
extensive history and even reprints the 1966 patent by the
inventor, a chemist named Norman H. Stingley.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the story of chewing gum, on the site of William
Wrigley Jr. Co. of Chicago (www.wrigley.com). The history starts
off with the ancient Greeks and the mastic tree; North American
Indians and spruce gum; and chicle, from the latex juice of the
sapodilla tree. There is some corporate back-patting involving the
psychological satisfaction of chewing, but we do learn that Wrigley
originally offered his gum as premiums for boxes of baking soda and
that his first two gum brands were Lotta and Vassar. A page notes
that the farmland required to grow mint for Wrigley totals 53
square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Moving from underneath the school desk to its top, Binney &AMP;
Smith's Crayola site (www.crayola.com) is user- , parent- and
teacher-friendly. In addition to the usual corporate information
and helpful hints (stain removal is one of them), there is an
online tour of the Crayola Factory museum in Easton, Pa., and a
wide array of craft and entertainment projects. An online feature
lets children print out their own cards and posters to color.

``NURSE BETTY'' IS PROOF THAT ``FARGO'' STILL EXERTS INFLUENCE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ERIC HARRISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   For several of the artists involved, ``Nurse Betty'' is a film
of firsts. It features star Morgan Freeman's first on-screen kiss,
for one thing. And for director Neil LaBute, whose two previous
dialogue- and idea-driven movies betrayed his origins as a
playwright, it is his first film with gunfire, physical violence
and extensive scenes set outdoors with moving cameras, automobiles
and the rest.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first movie LaBute has made that he didn't also write.
(Another first, it is the work of two never-before-produced
screenwriters.)
</P>
<P>
   For the audience, ``Nurse Betty'' isn't quite so singular an
experience.
</P>
<P>
   In its commingling of violence, drama and mordant, offbeat
humor, it recalls ``Fargo,'' the Coen brothers movie of 1996. The
success of that film and ``To Die For'' in 1995 sparked a small
revival of dark comedies, including ``The Opposite of Sex,''
``Happiness,'' ``Home Fries'' and ``Very Bad Things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nurse Betty'' is proof that ``Fargo'' still is exerting a
not-altogether-unwelcome influence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, LaBute is less sure with this sort of material than are
the Coen brothers.
</P>
<P>
   This is understandable. ``Nurse Betty'' is a bigger movie than
he is used to making, with more moving parts. The budget is about
800 times the $25,000 LaBute spent on ``In the Company of Men,''
his first movie. (``Your Friends and Neighbors'' cost $4 million.)
</P>
<P>
   Both of his previous films drew upon the work of other plays,
most notably Restoration comedies and the early work of David
Mamet, and they bear strong similarities to the plays that LaBute
has written for the stage. LaBute's voice as a writer and filmmaker
came through in undiluted form in those movies. The violence in
those movies was all psychological.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last year, he said he'd continue to make ``Neil
LaBute movies,'' but he will alternate them with films like this
one that stretch him and broaden his film vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Nurse Betty'' is any indication, these slightly more
commercial movies won't be mere digressions or artistic sellouts;
they'll be worth the wait, even if they aren't as distinctive or as
sure-footed as his more challenging personal projects.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Fargo,'' ``Nurse Betty'' is set, at least initially, in a
small Midwestern town of simple folk, and the action grows out of
men of dubious intelligence doing wrong and getting sucked in over
their heads in trouble. Both movies veer swiftly and easily between
gentle character-based humor and violence so unexpected and grisly
that we might not know quite how we're supposed to react.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Nurse Betty,'' at least, the violent jolt serves a purpose
beyond merely shocking the audience. Renee Zellweger as the title
character witnesses a gruesome murder. It is so horrific that she
not only blocks it from her mind, she temporarily enters a fantasy
world. She is a waitress when the movie begins, not a nurse. But
she starts to believe she is a character in her favorite soap
opera, ``A Reason to Love.''
</P>
<P>
   She sets out for Los Angeles, seeking the love of her life, Dr.
David Ravell (Greg Kinnear), not realizing that the man she seeks
is but an actor playing a role and that the TV hospital where he
practices doesn't exist. Nor does she realize that Freeman and
Chris Rock, the hit men whose dirty work sent her over the edge,
are on her tail.
</P>
<P>
   LaBute has toned down some of the later violence that was in his
shooting script, perhaps choosing to focus more on the development
of the characters.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman plays a hit man on the verge of retirement, a
thoughtful, well-read professional who takes pride in his work.
This was to be his last job, but the impetuousness of his partner
has caused complications.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the two drive cross-country in search of Betty, he finds
himself falling in love with the woman he imagines her to be.
</P>
<P>
   Rock's character, it turns out, is as big a fan of ``A Reason to
Love'' as she is. But for the longest time, neither man realizes
how the TV show figures into their case. They think Betty is a
tough-as-nails ``femme fatale'' who is fleeing with valuable cargo
they were hired to retrieve.
</P>
<P>
   As a stand-up comedian, Rock can be smart and provocative, but
he's no actor. Time and again, he gives funny readings to lines
that, nevertheless, do not work precisely because funny readings
are all they are. There's sometimes a lag of maybe half a second
between his utterances (or, more accurately, his yelling of his
lines) and our comprehension. An actor could've made the readings
funny and expressive at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Zellweger is one of those actresses we sometimes wonder about.
Her performance as a Hasidic Jew in ``A Price Above Rubies'' was
unconvincing enough that it made her work in ``Jerry Maguire'' seem
like possibly a fluke. She's been good since then, but sometimes it
has appeared she's been hired mainly because she's so adorable when
she crinkles her eyes and pouts.
</P>
<P>
   She's adorable in ``Nurse Betty,'' too, but the adorableness and
all of her mannerisms are employed in the creation of a character
here _ they're not just disembodied traits. We like her. We care
about what happens to her.
</P>
<P>
   God looks after children and fools. In Los Angeles, Betty gets a
job, a place to stay and a friend to look after her, and then she
tracks down Dr. Ravell. Ravell, or the actor who plays him, is as
taken with her as we are.
</P>
<P>
   Before it is all over, the movie changes tone dramatically at
least once more; again the shift is unsettling. LaBute wants to
unsettle us, but at the same time the movie's denouement isn't laid
out as clearly as it ought to be. This raises questions about the
sureness of the director's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Just how much of that unsettledness we're feeling is the result
of artistic choice and how much of it is LaBute accidently striking
the wrong key?
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it shouldn't matter. The movie is the movie,
accidents and all. And LaBute strikes enough of the right keys to
make you curious about the dramatic television series he says he's
working on for ABC and his upcoming film adaptation of the novel
``Possession,'' set in Victorian England. &QL;

NEW TECHNOLOGY IMPROVES DIGITAL IMAGING BY ADDRESSING LIGHT
LEVELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By ANNE EISENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The megapixel race has been the whole game in digital cameras
for the past two years, as the cameras have gone from 1 megapixel
or less to sharper, clearer images of nearly 4 megapixels.
</P>
<P>
   That's all about resolution. But another crucial aspect of
capturing a high-quality image has lagged far behind, and that is
dynamic range, the gradations of light and dark a digital camera
can capture so that details are not washed out by light or
concealed by shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a new technology promises to increase the dynamic range
substantially, not just for digital still and video cameras, but
for virtually any imaging system, including those based on X-rays
and infrared radiation.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is significant not only for its promise to banish
underexposed or overexposed snapshots. It also has implications for
Web cameras, video surveillance, robotics, medical imaging and any
other system that uses images for measurements. Such systems, for
example, let doctors track changes in the size, color and shape of
lesions in the intestinal tract or let vehicle control systems
maintain proper distance between vehicles on the highways.
</P>
<P>
   The technology, a combination of software and hardware
modifications developed in the past two years by researchers led by
Shree Nayar, a professor of computer science at Columbia University
and head of the university's Computer Vision Laboratory. Nayar's
technology, which experts in the field say is simple but powerful,
increases the richness of detail a digital camera can provide.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Nayar demonstrated that when a digital camera that
measured about 8 bits or 256 levels of brightness at each pixel was
retrofitted with this technology, the 8-bit sensor extracted up to
12 bits of brightness value, thus increasing the dynamic range to
4,098 levels of brightness. By modifying a standard digital camera
with his technology Nayar has made it work in a far higher dynamic
range.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is important work that makes the task of image analysis
easier,'' said Berthold K.P. Horn, an expert in robot vision and a
professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``It gives more accurate
data, and it is data that exists throughout the image, not washed
out in some areas.''
</P>
<P>
   With the new method, there is a small loss of resolution,
particularly in the very bright or very dark areas, but, Horn said,
``you have some image there, where before you had it totally
lost.''
</P>
<P>
   A description of the basic system was presented at the IEEE
Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. Tomoo
Mitsunaga, a Sony scientist who is visiting at Columbia, is
co-author of the paper with Nayar. Further work extending the
algorithms and applying them in color photography was done by Nayar
and Srinivasa Narasimhan, a graduate student at Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbia University team's innovations are quite different
from traditional software that can, for instance, enhance parts of
an image by brightening it slightly. For such systems to work, the
initial information on the image must already exist. But, Nayar
said, ``Areas that are too saturated or too dark inherently lack
information. No amount of post-processing can recreate scene
details that were never captured to begin with.''
</P>
<P>
   Nayar's solution to over- or undersaturated areas of light has
two parts: hardware and software. In conventional digital camera
chips, all the pixels collect light equally. Nayar's hardware
solution, by contrast, involves changing the amount of light
received at each pixel, using, for instance, a mask that varies the
exposure of neighboring pixels.
</P>
<P>
   The differing exposures are repeated over the entire array of
pixels, in effect, building multiple exposures into a single image.
After Nayar's image is collected and stored, special software
reconstructs an image with a wide range of brightness variations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key insight here is that even if one pixel is saturated,
it's likely a nearby pixel will still be producing meaningful
brightness,'' Nayar said, just as another pixel might have zero
brightness because of low exposure, but a nearby one have some data
on brightness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This solution is a clever idea,'' said Pietro Perone, a
professor of electrical engineering at the California Institute of
Technology and a specialist in computational vision. Perone said
there was some photon loss in retrofitting the camera, as the mask
in front of the sensor was, like sunglasses, darkening the light.
An ideal system, one designed from scratch, he said, would have
different-size pixels to avoid wasting photons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market will choose between retrofitted standard sensors
and some photon loss, or new sensors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The real world has enormous fluctuations in brightness that have
long posed problems for scientists working with computer images.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nayar's system provides a natural, simple solution to a
serious historical problem,'' said Jitendra Malik, professor of
computer science at the University of California in Berkeley, and a
specialist in computer vision. ``The problem of saturated light
outdoors is obvious, but even indoors, with light streaming in the
windows you sacrifice either the bright or the dark regions. This
technology recovers the information in those regions.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer vision, or machine vision, as it is also called, is
expected to have many outdoor uses, like car-mounted cameras that
use image data to maintain a fixed distance from another vehicle,
eliminating the brake-tapping of present versions of cruise
control.
</P>
<P>
   The new technology also promises help in medical applications.
Takeo Kanade, a professor and head of the robotics institute at
Carnegie Mellon University who has experience with laproscopic
techniques where a tiny camera is inserted in the body, explained
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The camera doesn't have sufficient dynamic range for the
bright shiny portions that tend to be saturated with light, and for
the darker fields which can't be seen,'' Kanade said. Today,
laproscopic images of lesions are visually analyzed by doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future,'' Kanade said, the computer will look to
measure the size, shape, and color of the lesion, but right now the
camera is not good enough as a measurement device.''
</P>
<P>
   Nayar is the holder of a number of patents in computer vision,
and is the inventor of the Omnicamera, a 360 degree camera that
allows internet or television viewers to see images in all
directions simultaneously.

have defied resolution during his presidency. He tried to fend off
a proposal from Russian president Vladimir Putin that would lead to

BELGIUM'S `COOL' ROYAL COUPLE COMING TO NEW YORK TO PROMOTE THEIR
COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS NOTE: The complete text of the New York Times interview with
Prince Philippe and Princess Mathilde of Belgium is available from
The New York Times on the Web: www.nytimes.com) 
 By GLENN COLLINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The royals are coming.
</P>
<P>
   No, no, not the poor old British crown prince, still
overshadowed by the tragic legacy of Diana, Princess of Wales. Nor
any of his relatives, like that fellow who flies the helicopter and
his former lady who does the weight-loss thing.
</P>
<P>
   No, New York is getting the other ones, the fabulously cool new
royals: the handsome Crown Prince Philippe of Belgium and his
ravishing Princess Mathilde, the fairy-tale couple that have
monopolized magazine covers and glossy photo spreads throughout
Europe. Their nuptials on Dec. 4 were trumpeted as the last royal
wedding of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission is nothing less than to take New York City by
storm, winning hearts, minds, media and, more important, market
share.
</P>
<P>
   And so, on Saturday, just when New York is once again a
Millennium Summit-free zone, the prince and princess will kick off
their whirlwind five-day visit. A plane full of European reporters
and news crews will arrive at Kennedy International Airport with
the royal delegation to cover the tour, which includes stops at the
United Nations, the World Trade Center, the Metropolitan Museum of
Art and even a supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   The joint visit is unprecedented, given the traditional
protectiveness of the royal household. And the great to-do over the
arrival is even more unusual given that the royals hail from the
tiny, distant nation of Belgium, which to many New Yorkers is
simply the country the waffles come from.
</P>
<P>
   But that stubbornly self-deprecating nation of 10 million people
by the North Sea, in an area scarcely larger than New Jersey, has
enjoyed an extraordinary visibility in New York City of late. The
effusion of Belgianophilia includes eateries like Markt, Petite
Abeille and Le Pain Quotidien, proliferating in a restaurant
district in Manhattan that some call Little Belgium. Not to mention
the explosion of interest in Belgian beers, chocolates,
double-fried potatoes and deconstructivist fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all this, ``Belgium is a well-kept secret that deserves
to be better known by many more Americans,'' the prince said in the
couple's first joint written interview.
</P>
<P>
   Ingeborg Kristoffersen, the Belgian consul general in New York,
said the royal visit ``is a way to bring attention to the variety
and quality of things Belgian.''
</P>
<P>
   One indication of the importance of the visit was the interview
with the prince and princess, which ``is quite extraordinary,''
said Philippe Gyhsens, a royal-watching reporter for Belgium's
largest newspaper, Hetlaatste Nieuws, in Brussels. ``Journalists
are not allowed to ask questions of the prince or princess.''
</P>
<P>
   But the symbolic visit of the future monarch of Belgium is
decidedly serious in a nation where the constitutional monarchy
``is the only institution holding the country together,'' said Luc
Sante, the Belgian-born writer who is a visiting professor at Bard
College. He referred to the disparate, oft-fussing population of
Dutch-speaking Flemings and French-speaking Walloons.
</P>
<P>
   The ``working visit,'' as the prince termed it, is also a
long-sought validation for American importers of Belgian products,
who traversed a desert of indifference for decades before the
current Belgian boom. The advent of the royals is nothing less than
``a culmination, coming at a very fortuitous time,'' said Don
Fineberg, co-founder of Vanberg &AMP; DeWulf of Cooperstown, an
importer of Belgian specialty beers.
</P>
<P>
   But are they attractive enough to bring off a Belgian conquest?
Well, though he drives a Carrera 911 Porsche, studied at Oxford and
Stanford Universities, leads trade missions and flies F-16s, Prince
Philippe, the 40-year-old heir to the Belgian throne, does have his
Prince Charles-ish aspects.
</P>
<P>
   Belgians had nearly given up on the prince, a perennial
bachelor, until he stunned the nation by announcing the royal
wedding from out of the blue _ after a secret three-year courtship
_ last fall. He is reported to be reticent, even, well, ``dull,''
as Ghysens, the royal-watcher, put it.
</P>
<P>
   It is a reputation that ``I hope is unjustified,'' said the
prince, adding: ``I am not the best judge in this matter. You
should ask my wife.'' The princess did not touch on this point in
her interview.
</P>
<P>
   Princess Mathilde, a friendly, radiant 27-year-old, has been
dubbed the ``Queen of Hearts'' by the French magazine Paris-Match.
She resembles the model Claudia Schiffer and traces her
aristocratic lineage back to the 13th century. She is destined to
become the 170-year-old country's first Belgian-born queen (royal
predecessors have come from France, Italy, Spain and Sweden). So
far, she can do no wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally we have a gorgeous princess, and some glitter and
glamour,'' Ghysens said. ``Now we finally have an international
visiting card.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Surprising in a nation known for its reserve, she was greeted
with a chant of ``Mathilde, Mathilde, Mathilde'' from thousands of
Belgians during the wedding. ``It was a very private moment for the
prince and me, and we were glad that we could share it with the
Belgian people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mathilde d'Udekem d'Acoz started her own speech-therapy practice
at the age of 22 in Brussels. She is currently working toward a
degree in psychology. Despite the royal fish bowl, the princess
said, ``I intend to continue my studies, as I am doing my finals
next year.'' But she acknowledged, ``As you can imagine, it will be
very difficult for me to work as a speech therapist as I did
before.''
</P>
<P>
   For the princess, who once lived in Washington for three months,
the return to America is welcome because ``I really enjoyed my stay
here,'' she said. When asked if she found it difficult to define
the role of princess in the year 2000, she agreed that the role was
challenging, but said that ``my support of my husband is of utmost
importance to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The high point of her activities is likely to be an
attention-focusing visit to Abraham House, a seven-year-old halfway
home in the South Bronx founded and run by Sister Simone Ponnet, a
Belgian nun who works as a chaplain at Rikers Island.
</P>
<P>
   The prince and princess _ who are to be addressed
``monseigneur'' and ``madame,'' don't you know _ will attend 17
major events from Saturday until their departure on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The giddy whirl _ graced on occasion by Prime Minister Guy
Verhofstadt of Belgium _ will range from a glittering dinner
fund-raiser for the Belgian-American Chamber of Commerce at the
Metropolitan Club to yes, a supermarket promotion: the royals will
swoop down on the D'Agostino supermarket at 23rd Street and Eighth
Avenue to kick off a celebration of Belgian products at 24
D'Agostino stores.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a Wall Street power breakfast (followed, of
course, by the ringing of the bell by the prince to launch trading
on the New York Stock Exchange). There will be global trade
seminars and presentations for business leaders at the World Trade
Center to sell the idea that Belgium is about biotechnology as well
as mussels and frites.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably the royals will, by example, quash the base rumors
that Belgian beer makers are disappointed that they don't publicly
drink more of the national brew. ``I want to reassure you that both
Princess Mathilde and myself are fond of Belgian beer,'' said the
prince, ``and we drink it often.''
</P>
<P>
   Belgian living in New York will also be received at Markt, the
Belgian bistro on 14th Street and Ninth Avenue. Young Belgian
artists, academics and entrepreneurs will be feted at Le Pain
Quotidien in Soho.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the advent of the royals in New York is viewed by
some expatriates as fair Belgian retribution. ``Celebrities, the
modern kings, have become one of America's most important export
products,'' said Tom Ronse, an artist who is one of the
metropolitan area's 8,000 Belgians.
</P>
<P>
   It is no exaggeration to say that the European press gushed,
swooned and curtsied at the couple's picture-perfect December
wedding, attended by some 45,000 Belgians and, literally, the
crowned heads of Europe. A half-dozen Belgian television outlets
offered as much as 15 hours of live coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are Belgians, afterward some grumbled at the $1
million of taxpayers' money spent on the wedding for appointments
that included a 1,000-person security detail, a host of motorcycle
police and an F-16 fighter fly-by of the palace.
</P>
<P>
   But so great was the swell of national optimism that
commentators said the ``Mathilde Factor'' helped to distract
attention from a series of national scandals that questioned
Belgians' faith in the country's policies, its judiciary and its
political system, ranging from a dioxin food scare to a notorious
pedophile-and-murder case bungled by Belgian detectives.
</P>
<P>
   It also caused consternation in the royal household, European
journalists said, because Prince Philippe, not unlike Prince
Charles, was being upstaged by his glamorous bride.
</P>
<P>
   Annually Belgian taxpayers spend more than $8 million to support
their monarchy, only a 10th of what the British annually pay for
their royals. If the queen in England, as head of the Commonwealth
and the Church of England, has more designated power, in Belgium
the king appoints the new government and assumes a crucial unifying
function.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one of the royals were to favor the Flemish or the French,
chaos would break out,'' said Sante, the Belgian writer who
immigrated to the United States at 5 and described his life in
``The Factory of Facts'' (Pantheon Books, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   But the prince said there was ``a new spirit in the country,''
an improvement ``in the relations between the Flemish and the
Walloons.''
</P>
<P>
   That new spirit could have something to do with Princess
Mathilde, who is, herself, a balanced ticket. The ancestors of the
princess come from Flemish-speaking Flanders to the north, but she
grew up in French-speaking Wallonia to the south, and lived in
bilingual Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, the princess is trying to tone down
``Mathildemania.'' ``Maybe I will not be able to fulfill all
expectations,'' she said humbly, ``but I will surely do my
utmost.''
</P>
<P>
   The prince's fortitude and his bride's charisma may soon be put
to the test: King Albert II, Philippe's 66-year-old father, who had
already undergone painful back surgery, had quadruple bypass heart
surgery in April, giving rise to speculation that he will soon step
down from the throne.
</P>
<P>
   So, will America fall prey to rampant Belgianism? Some
expatriates are amused at the very presumption. ``Why is there this
incredible fascination with royalty?'' asked Jacqueline Goossens,
who lives in Stapleton, Staten Island, and files weekly reports on
life in the city for two Belgian publications, De Morgen and Knack.
``I am flabbergasted that modern people in this day and age are
interested in them.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard C. Youngken, a city planner with an eye for design
disasters, pulled into a parking lot next to a busy four-lane road
in Middletown, R.I., and looked up.
</P>
<P>
   There it was, a perfect specimen: a rugged brown utility pole
that stood at least 40 feet high, topped with transformers and
strung with wires leading off in every direction.
</P>
<P>
   There were electric lines, telephone lines, cable television
lines, even lines for the city's fire alarms _ all of them joining
on this tar-stained totem of technological ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like, `Good God, what have you got on that pole?'''
Youngken said incredulously, craning his head out the window before
driving off to point out the next eyesore.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of miles south, at a house in Faulkier County, Va.,
Fred Smith has his own problem with visual pollution. Through a
window, he said, he can see a 200-foot cell phone tower that stands
on a low ridge against an otherwise uninterrupted view of the Blue
Ridge Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are putting them up all over the place,'' said Smith, who
has written a letter to his local newspaper declaring the towers
``this century's blight.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Youngken are just two crusaders in a growing movement
against the encroachment of obtrusive, ugly technology into daily
life. It is time, participants say, to realize that the devices we
use in our cars and houses can have an impact on our physical
environments. Some people may be fortunate enough to live in cities
or newly developed suburbs where wires, cables, transmitters and
receivers are buried underground or hidden on rooftops. But for
many Americans, those wires and towers are all too visible.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, people have started to fight for measures
that will at least reduce the visual blight. Local government
meetings are full of heated discussions about what can be done, and
in extreme cases, what lawsuits should be filed. City planners are
talking regularly to utility and telecommunications companies,
trying to fend off obtrusive additions to the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Some people active in the campaign are becoming well versed in
the intricacies of telephone transmission lines and cellular
equipment so they can argue intelligently with those who install
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``People care about how these things look,'' said Youngken, who
is the director of the Dunn Foundation, a small organization in
Warwick, R.I., that is dedicated to raising awareness of the value
of well-planned, pedestrian-friendly towns and cities. Part of the
foundation's mission is to show people that the underpinnings of
technology can be hidden.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope,'' he said, ``is that more people will expect it _
and demand it.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 73,000 cell phone towers with heights of at least 200
feet are scattered across the American landscape, according to the
Federal Communications Commission. But that does not include myriad
other cellular transmitters and receivers, called cell sites, that
are placed on lower towers or on poles and buildings. Some experts
estimate that more than 100,000 cell sites are now in place.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Kreines, a consultant in Tiburon, Calif., who advises local
governments on doing business with telecommunications companies,
said that the growth of such technology is just the beginning. He
estimated that as many as 1 million cell sites would be installed
by the time technology companies reached their desired capacity for
wireless data and voice transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   Utility poles and wires are even more common. According to the
FCC, more than 180 million telephone cables stretch across the
country. The country has more than 3 million miles of overhead
power lines, according to the Edison Electric Institute, an
association of utility companies.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 100,000 miles of lines are underground, the institute
says, and most of those buried lines are in large cities. For
example, American Electric Power, a large power company with
customers in 11 Midwestern states, has buried only 12.3 percent of
the lines that carry electricity along streets to houses and
offices in its coverage areas.
</P>
<P>
   Newer tendrils of technology are also beginning to entwine
themselves around communities. Fiber optic cable, the backbone of
many future high-speed Internet lines, can be now seen along some
highways on utility poles. Television stations, which are required
by the FCC to deliver digital broadcasts by 2003, have asked the
agency for permission to pre-empt local regulations controlling the
number and size of towers so they can put up more towers. Metricom,
a company that has built wireless data networks in Atlanta and San
Diego so far, is putting radio transceivers on top of street lamps
and traffic lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody realizes there are all these things going up there,''
Kreines said. ``It's happening all over the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Two seemingly unrelated trends have led to today's landscapes _
and to the current fights over control of them. Telecommunications
experts say that deregulation is partly responsible.
</P>
<P>
   The Telecommunications Act of 1996 not only led to more
competition among providers of phone and cable services (and
therefore more towers and cables), but also included a provision
that protected companies from being shut out by local zoning laws.
Under the 1996 law, no city or town can keep a cell phone company
from putting up sites within its borders. The law adds, however,
that local governments may have some say over the locations of the
towers that are about to spring up in their midst and how they
look.
</P>
<P>
   That is where the second trend comes in. While planning boards
and zoning laws have long been in place, planning experts say,
residents of cities and towns are starting to look at how those
regulations relate to the overall aesthetics and characters of
their communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are waking up to design,'' Youngken said. He has
helped several towns create strategic development plans and has
found that one of their first goals is to bury the above-ground
utility lines. And when towns plan for the future, he said, some of
their first thoughts how to avoid being overrun by cell phone
towers.

 &HT;    BellSouth promotes Harris to lead consumer services unit
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - BellSouth has promoted Isaiah Harris Jr. to president
of its consumer services unit, replacing Sue McLaughlin, who has
resigned effective Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, who has been vice president for finances, will take
responsibility for an 8,500-person group that is the core of the
$26 billion-a-year company.
</P>
<P>
   With 14.5 million customers, the unit handles local phone and
customer service in nine states. On that turf, BellSouth still has
dominance, but is facing increasing competition during a time of
technology change in which the Internet is ever-more important.
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced that Pat Shannon, the company's
principal accounting officer, will take on Harris' former duties.
However, no one will step into Harris' job title as vice president
for finances.
</P>
<P>
   Harris praised the management team assembled by McLaughlin.
``The challenges will be steep, but they are not insurmountable,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris came to BellSouth from SuperValu, a wholesaler and
retailer of food, and before that worked for 13 years with Peat
Marwick Main &AMP; Co. While at Peat Marwick, he played eight seasons
of professional football as a wide receiver with the St. Louis
Cardinals and New Orleans Saints.
</P>
<P>
   According to a statement from the company, McLaughlin left ``to
pursue other directions.'' McLaughlin, who was traveling and
unavailable for comment, was among the top-ranking female
executives at BellSouth. Harris is among the highest ranking blacks
at BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin came to BellSouth less than three years ago from
Kodak as part of BellSouth's efforts to pump up its marketing
efforts for the new age of competition. During her tenure,
BellSouth continued its streak of victories in the annual
competition among local phone companies judged by consulting
company J.D. Power &AMP; Associates. But after four straight
first-place finishes, BellSouth this year placed fifth, just behind
Bell Atlantic. The winner was Southern New England Telephone. In
general, customer satisfaction has declined, said J.D. Power in the
August 8 announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a goal to win that,'' Harris said. ``There is no
reason in my mind why we cannot. I think it's a matter of focus. I
think it's a matter of resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris, who had previously reported to chief financial officer
Ron Dykes, will now report to Richard A. Anderson, president of
BellSouth Customer Markets.

``THE OPPORTUNISTS'' IS QUIETLY PLEASING IN ITS OWN, MODEST WAY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
Christopher Walken and the film ``The Opportunists'' are a perfect
match.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walken reigns as master of the minimalist performance _ this is
a compliment _ and ``The Opportunists,'' as written and directed by
Myles Connell, avoids excess and size at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   That may well leave viewers, arriving for a crime caper,
surprised to realize they've stumbled into a mild, modest, almost
arty character study. They'll be even more surprised, however, when
the ending of this movie proves to be a lot different than the
first 75 minutes indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Walken plays Victor Kelly, who lives in a modest Brooklyn house
with his daughter. Before we learn Victor's past, Connell carefully
reveals him as a guy who lovingly cares for an elderly aunt. He
also cares for an old Buick Riviera _ it turns out he is repairing
it for a police acquaintance to earn a few extra bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Victor lives with a local bar owner, Sally (Cyndi Lauper), who's
fond of him in a quiet, unextravagant way.
</P>
<P>
   A young Irish relative, Michael (Peter MacDonald), shows up at
the door, eager to meet his American cousins. Victor's never heard
of Michael, but when his daughter says the youth's story checks
out, Victor puts him up until Michael can find a job.
</P>
<P>
   This mellow character development goes on so long we are lulled
into surprise when something happens to the Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   Victor, struggling to pay rent and other debts, needed that
money. Now Victor is susceptible when Michael and a local man
(Donal Logue of ``The Tao of Steve'') come to him, deferentially
but insistently, with the idea for a crime. Victor was a
safecracker before a stretch in prison made him famous in his
neighborhood, ended his marriage and made him vow to go straight.
</P>
<P>
   Connell has already established that we are not in for a
happy-go-lucky crime caper in which the hero merrily pulls off a
slick job amid exciting chases and adventures. Now the sober tone
threatens to turn gloomy. The prospect of a triumphant outcome for
Victor and associates seems remote, especially since Michael is not
who he pretends to be.
</P>
<P>
   The format may be classic film noir _ the imperfect but
basically likable protagonist unwillingly trapped into a crime,
with the web of fate tightening toward almost certain doom. But
Connell, showing admirable patience and restraint in his feature
film debut, does not play it that way.
</P>
<P>
   The film ignores traditional crime film beats and homages,
treating all the characters as ordinary people and avoiding
dramatic music or suspense scenes, even in the heist. When a
potentially melodramatic situation arises, Connelly deftly
sidesteps into something much more likely (and, some will feel,
more mundane).
</P>
<P>
   That does not prepare us for the ending. Played in the same
minimalist tone, it nevertheless takes the film in a completely
unexpected direction. Frankly, Connell employs considerable pixie
dust to do this, but by maintaining the same understated pace and
feel, he pulls it off with surprising dexterity.
</P>
<P>
   The film's resolution is satisfying and does not seem overly
dishonest. Saying more would be, well, criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Walken, bless him, never works to make Victor charming or cool,
but has us pulling for him, anyway. The film and his performance
are flawlessly wedded: They understand each other perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is hardly a must-see, and ``Mission: Impossible'' fans
would probably rather watch paint dry, but it's sneakily involving
and quietly pleasing in its own, modest way. &QL;

 UNDATED: phone towers. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Property values play a big role, too. The Dunn Foundation, in
its research on utility lines, has found that real estate prices
increase in places where lines have been buried. Kreines has seen
real estate values drop when cell phone towers have been installed
nearby. In one case in Ho Ho Kus, N.J., he said, a tax assessor
determined that the aggregated value of property near a cell phone
tower would drop as much as $660,000.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications companies say they are trying to balance two
opposing desires: Cellular customers want clearer calls, and
property owners want unobstructed views. But the companies say they
try to be sensitive to aesthetics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do the best we can to keep our facilities from looking
unsightly,'' said Tracey Kennedy, a spokeswoman for Verizon, which
provides wireless and conventional telephone service. ``The last
thing you want,'' she said, ``are your constituents to be up in
arms about their surroundings.''
</P>
<P>
   Some communities have found that companies are responsive to
their requests. Several have asked cell phone companies to install
cell sites on top of light poles or on buildings where they are
less noticeable. And camouflaging is becoming more popular for the
sites. Some cell phone companies have made cell phone towers look
like pine trees, and in Arizona and California, cell sites that
look like giant saguaro cactuses rise 35 feet above the desert.
</P>
<P>
   When compromises cannot be reached, battles erupt. Search the
Internet for ``cell phone towers,'' and you will find dozens of Web
sites that have been posted by people protesting the erection of
towers that block their views.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, wireless companies have sued municipalities for
the right to go forward with their plans. In others, local
governments have sued to prevent construction. Kreines lists about
15 cases on his Web site (www.planwireless.com).
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, most cell-site lawsuits were won by the
telecommunications companies. But some observers say that is
changing as municipalities realize that they can place limits on
construction and still stay within the law.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in a case last year against Albemarle County in
Virginia, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of
the county. The county's board of supervisors had denied an
application filed by 360(degree)Communications, a company that
wanted to install a 100-foot tower on a ridge called Dudley
Mountain. The company sued, but the appeals court ruled that the
denial of that single tower did not have the effect of prohibiting
the provision of wireless services. The county board, for example,
might someday permit other towers or poles in other places.
</P>
<P>
   Getting rid of ugly utility lines may be a tougher fight. Cities
and property owners are usually expected to cover the costs of
taking down the wires and burying them, a practice known as
``undergrounding.'' The cost to communities can run from $500,000
to $3 million per mile, said Dan Weaver, an urban planner who
coordinates a San Francisco campaign to bury utility wires.
</P>
<P>
   Technical challenges contribute to the high costs, said Dave
Gordon, a manager for American Electric Power. Construction crews,
for example, must avoid things like water and sewer lines when they
excavate. And while underground wires are protected from falling
trees or high winds, Gordon said, they are often harder and more
expensive to repair when something does go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But many cities and towns argue that the benefits of putting
wires underground outweigh the disadvantages. Planners show
photographs of cities in the early 20th century, when a haphazard
sprawl of telephone and electrical cables crisscrossed every
street. In new suburban developments, most developers do not even
consider installing above-ground lines.
</P>
<P>
   At least nine states have granted municipalities the authority
to create special districts that could tax residents to cover those
costs, according to the Dunn Foundation. In California, for
example, a surcharge is added to utility bills to pay for burying
wires in areas where landowners are also willing to pay for land
surveys, connection fees, new street lighting and the cost of
administering the special districts. Those services, Weaver said,
can cost residents as much as $7,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   But those who oppose unsightly towers and overhead wires say
that is not enough. The California plan does not work, Weaver said,
because the areas that have the most overhead wires are usually
populated by residents on low or fixed incomes, who are generally
unable to afford to pay to bury the wires.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more people are getting upset because undergrounding
just never happens,'' Weaver said. The joke in San Francisco, he
added, is that some areas are on a ``300-year undergrounding
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver is researching new ways to pay for putting wires
underground. One possibility, he said, is to charge a fee to those
buying and selling property in areas where wires are still hanging
overhead. That is no different, he said, from the fees that are
typically included in the cost of houses in new developments where
wires are buried.
</P>
<P>
   Other options, Youngken said, include trying to hide the lines
above ground.
</P>
<P>
   As he continued his recent drive through the suburbs of Rhode
Island, he described some of those efforts. Some cash-strapped
towns have managed to move the wires to alleys or have requested
heavy-duty wire that can be strung through tree branches. At the
very least, he said, communities should require utility companies
to get rid of unnecessary poles.
</P>
<P>
   As Youngken talked, he passed a sign for Newport, R.I., which
recently put some of its utility lines underground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now look,'' he said, pointing at the scenery whizzing by. The
poles suddenly disappeared, and nothing but grassy lawns sloped
down to a tranquil waterfront on the left side of the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a difference,'' he said. ``Isn't it amazing?''

FAMILY CONNECTIONS CAN BE TRYING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
( Repeating for all who need it) 
By KEN LLOYD 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Question: A few months ago, the owner's son was placed in my
department. His performance in the beginning was satisfactory, but
it has taken a nose dive lately. I want to discipline him, although
I am somewhat hesitant because of his family connection. Do you
have any suggestions? B.V.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Just because this is a family business does not mean
that you have to put up with monkey business from the owner's son.
You should treat Junior as any other employee, and if you're going
to discipline him, make sure that you are applying the same
standards that apply to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like you are afraid of the owner's reaction as a
result of this discipline. If he somehow sides with Junior on this
matter, he has clearly decided to run this operation as something
other than a business. This type of a reaction not only weakens the
character and skills of Junior, but it also weakens the character
of the company in many important respects.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, your job is to run your department as effectively
and productively as possible. If you allow Junior to play the
family card and get away with all sorts of nonsense, it is just a
matter of time before the rest of your troops start to resent him
and you.
</P>
<P>
   In a word, Junior needs to be disciplined. If Junior's dad gives
you a bad time, then this is a good time to look carefully at where
the company is going and determine whether you want to go there
with it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our company is going through a reorganization and I am going
to be working for a woman who is known to be on a major power trip.
The word is that everything has to be done her way. Can you help me
deal with her? K.S.
</P>
<P>
   A: The most obvious suggestion is to approach this situation
with an open mind. If you expect to have problems with your
manager, that is exactly what you will find.
</P>
<P>
   Even though this manager is known to be on a major power trip,
it is possible that she went on this trip because of questionable
performance by her employees. This means that your best first step
is to make sure that the quality and quantity of your work are at a
very high level. More importantly, you may need to do some internal
public relations to make sure that she is aware of what you are
doing.
</P>
<P>
   If she remains on a power trip and tries to push you rather than
work with you, your next step is to meet with her. Your objective
is to figure out a way to work more productively with her. By this
time, you should have clear performance data that point to your
effectiveness on the job. Let her know that you can be even more
productive, but you need her help.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to be quiet and see what she says. Her reaction
in this meeting and in the days that follow it will tell you if
your positive feelings are going to transfer to her, or if you
should simply be thinking about a transfer in and of itself.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a point where I should stop leaving messages for a
sales prospect to call me? I have called him several times, but
never get anywhere. If I get him on the phone, he says he's busy
and will call me back, but never does. If I leave a message on his
voice mail, I never hear from him. T.S.
</P>
<P>
   A: If you truly believe that your product can meet this
prospect's needs, then you need to keep trying to get in touch with
him. You may, however, want to try a couple of different
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Try calling early in the morning or late in the day, and if you
get him on the phone, ask if this is a good time to talk. If it is,
start your presentation; if it is not, ask him when you should call
back. If he gives you a designated time, be sure to call back right
on the dot.
</P>
<P>
   Since your real objective is to get a meeting with him, a
slightly more assertive second approach may help. This time tell
him something like, ``I know how busy you are, but I am certain
that our product can save you X dollars or increase your revenues
by X. I'd like to set a 15-minute appointment with you. If you're
not convinced that this is the product for you within that time,
I'll leave. How would next Tuesday at 9 a.m. work for you?''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, remember that generating new customers is a
time-consuming process. It is always said that persistence pays,
but so does patience. &QL;

CITIGROUP BUYS TEXAS LENDING COMPANY FOR $31.1 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT BERNARD NELSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Citigroup Inc. turned its voracious appetite on Associates First
Capital Corp. Wednesday, gobbling up the Texas-based lending
company in a deal valued at $31.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup is already the largest credit card lender in the
world, the largest bank holding company in the United States, and a
leader in brokerage and insurance services.
</P>
<P>
   AFC is no slouch, either. With revenues of $7.1 billion in the
first half of the year, it is the biggest publicly traded American
company focused on loaning money to consumers. It is also the
fifth-largest consumer-lending firm in Japan, and has 700,000
customers in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Citigroup needs to do acquisitions like this if it wants to
keep growing at a 15 percent clip,'' said Dick Bove, an analyst who
covers both companies for Raymond James &AMP; Associates in St.
Petersburg, Fla. ``Plus, it gets a big boost internationally and
widens its lead as the biggest card lender in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   AFC was spun off from Ford Motor Co. in 1998. If the deal is
approved, it will join a stable of businesses that includes
Citibank, Salomon Smith Barney, and Travelers Property Casualty.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for AFC shareholders to receive 0.7334 shares of
Citigroup stock for each AFC share they own. All told, AFC
investors will get $42.49 per share _ a 52 percent premium over
Tuesday's closing price.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, AFC shares skyrocketed on the news, gaining $10.63
to close at $38.63. Citigroup shares, meanwhile, fell $2.56 to
close at $55. In both cases, trading volume was far heavier than
normal.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call, Citigroup chief executive Sanford Weill
said the move would pay off in the long term for his company's
investors, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The acquisition) increases the percent of our income that is
recurring and predictable, ignites what we want to do
internationally in our consumer franchise, and at the same time
adds 10 cents to earnings,'' Weill said.
</P>
<P>
   Weill said Citigroup will take a charge against earnings of $600
million to $700 million to pay for the AFC purchase. The move, he
said also would yield more benefits when the economic-induced boom
on Wall Street starts to slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumer finance has done better in recessionary periods over
the past 25 years,'' he said. ``It happens to be something all of
us up here know something about.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Wednesday, Citigroup and AFC said the agreement
would be consumated using the controversial pooling-of-interests
method of accounting. That way, Citigroup doesn't have to subtract
the so-called merger premium _ the amount above AFC's book value
that it paid _ from earnings in future quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Accounting Standards Board has proposed a rule
change that would make pooling of interests accounting illegal
starting next year. Instead, the bean-counting organization wants
corporations to use purchase accounting and take a charge on their
reported earnings as the premium value declines.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of such details, buying consumer finance companies
whose stocks are trading cheaply and combining them with other
businesses has been Weill's strategy for three decades. He built
Travelers Group _ the insurer, brokerage, and consumer finance
conglomerate that merged with Citicorp in 1998 _ that way.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of 1999, Citigroup shares have gained 136
percent, trouncing money-center banks such as Chase Manhattan Corp.
and topping some securities firms including Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Citi has taken the tack that bigger is better, and so far it
has proven to be right: Earnings have consistently been
increasing,'' said Daniel Bandi, a money manager at National City
Investment Management, whose fund has about 500,000 Citigroup
shares.

WHAT WILL WIN _ AND WHAT SHOULD
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   So it's not the Oscars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Or the Grammys. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Or even the MTV Movie Awards, for that matter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the standard line these days is that the Emmys _ the
52nd version of which airs Sunday on ABC _ may be of questionable
value and status. But, hey, we love it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   So we'll fearlessly handicap the major categories, from best
actor in a drama to best actress in a comedy.
</P>
<P>
   First up: Outstanding TV movie
</P>
<P>
   Nominees: ``Annie,'' ABC; ``If These Walls Could Talk 2,'' HBO;
``Introducing Dorothy Dandridge,'' HBO; ``Oprah Winfrey Presents:
Tuesdays With Morrie,'' ABC; ``RKO 281,'' HBO
</P>
<P>
   The Buzz: HBO is Tiger Woods in this category, winning seven
years running without even breaking a sweat, and the networks are
simply sick to death of it. ABC is placing substantial bets on
``Tuesdays With Morrie,'' which makes sense, considering that there
are at least a half-dozen other movies that could've adequately
replaced the musical ``Annie'' on this slate. (We can start with
``Freedom Song,'' a dignified telling of what happened when the
civil rights movement came to a small Southern town.) ``Introducing
Dorothy Dandridge,'' a sentimental look at the tragic life of the
late film actress, won a Golden Globe for its star, Halle Berry.
But that's pretty much what you'd expect from the voting foreign
press corps, which wanted to see Berry sashay up to the podium.
``If These Walls Could Talk 2,'' which explored the lesbian
experience in America, is the longest of shots in the category.
</P>
<P>
   What will win: ``RKO 281,'' the docudrama about the making of
``Citizen Kane.'' It offered a fresh, smart spin on a movie that
many Emmy voters probably consider the best ever.
</P>
<P>
   What should win: ``RKO 281.'' Because it offered a fresh, smart
spin on a movie that continues to fascinate.
</P>
<P>
   Outstanding miniseries
</P>
<P>
   Nominees: ``Arabian Nights,'' ABC; ``The Beach Boys: An American
Family,'' ABC; ``The Corner,'' HBO; ``Jesus,'' CBS; ``P.T.
Barnum,'' A&AMP;E.
</P>
<P>
   The Buzz: ``The Corner,'' a gritty look into drug use, is too
dark and too much of a downer. Voters were probably so surprised
that ``Jesus'' wasn't badly botched like most other network
biblical undertakings that it appeared better than it actually was.
``Arabian Nights'' has that Emmy flavor _ big, expensive, colorful.
The dark horse here is ``P.T. Barnum.''
</P>
<P>
   What will win: ``Arabian Nights.''
</P>
<P>
   What should win: ``The Corner.'' Well-crafted, well written,
well executed, painfully honest. An important portrayal that could
have easily passed as a documentary or docudrama. That it depicted
a real-life neighborhood only strengthens its cause. Losing will
certainly add to the travesty, since the lead actors, Khandi
Alexander and T.K. Carter, whose performances were the best of the
year on TV, weren't even nominated.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Supporting players rarely get the attention they deserve, so
we're proud to sing their praises. Which isn't to say that everyone
nominated for an Emmy in the supporting category this year deserves
the attention. We provide a scorecard:
</P>
<P>
   Outstanding supporting actress _ comedy
</P>
<P>
   Nominees: Jennifer Aniston, ``Friends,'' NBC; Kim Cattrall,
``Sex and the City,'' HBO; Lisa Kudrow, ``Friends,'' NBC; Megan
Mullally, ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' NBC; Doris Roberts, ``Everybody Loves
Raymond,'' NBC.
</P>
<P>
   The Buzz: Where's Courteney Cox Arquette? ``Friends' '' most
appealing performer this past year didn't make the cut in what
would have been an intriguing race if she had. Aniston and Kudrow
were worthy, at different times in different years, but not this
past season. Roberts also isn't generating much buzz: She's a
consistent joy on ``Raymond,'' but she's overshadowed by an
ensemble that delivers humor with honesty and clarity.
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: Cattrall, who has become quite the scene stealer
in the hot ``Sex and the City.'' She's also a TV veteran who has
finally found material that suits her.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Mullally, whose pseudo-ditzy voice turns her
lines into glorious melodies with the power to sting. Give the
woman credit for making us care about a character who, let's face
it, is obnoxious, self-centered and has few redeeming qualities to
speak of, except, of course, being absolutely hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   Outstanding supporting actress _ drama
</P>
<P>
   Nominees: Stockard Channing, ``The West Wing,'' NBC; Tyne Daly,
``Judging Amy,'' CBS; Allison Janney, ``The West Wing,'' NBC; Nancy
Marchand, ``The Sopranos,'' HBO; Holland Taylor, ``The Practice,''
ABC.
</P>
<P>
   The Buzz: Marchand, who died earlier this year, is being talked
about in sentimental terms, which is making her competitors sweat.
As for the rest of the field, you can toss a coin and not feel
cheated. Daly and Janney are both strong but are representing
first-year series. Channing was seen little but had an impact every
time she showed up. Taylor, who surprised _ and upset _ most
everyone last year by winning this category as a guest star who
qualified as a regular, is being viewed as the dark horse. That
shows how strong this field is.
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: Marchand, with Emmy bowing to a sentimental vote
that, for a change, won't make us cry bloody murder.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Daly, whose acting style often reminds me of
James Earl Jones' in terms of making every scene noticeable with
impressive oracular pronouncements. While her mother-hen gruffness
can be off-putting, Daly does this sort of thing so charmingly that
you don't mind that she's driving everyone around her batty.

WHO WILL WIN _ AND WHO SHOULD
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Supporting players on TV have a tendency to steal the spotlight
from their more staid, traditionally appealing leading men, and
this year is no different. From belligerent fathers to belligerent
mobsters, the supporting categories are full of actors who know how
to get noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Outstanding supporting actor _ comedy
</P>
<P>
   Nominees: Peter Boyle, ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS; Brad
Garrett, ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS; Sean Hayes, ``Will &AMP;
Grace,'' NBC; Peter MacNicol, ``Ally McBeal,'' Fox; David Hyde
Pierce, ``Frasier,'' NBC.
</P>
<P>
   The Buzz: Pierce is still able to convey wit, humor and pathos
with merely a roll of the eyes, and his multiple Emmy wins prove
his popularity with voters. His chief competition comes from
Garrett and Boyle from the popular ``Raymond,'' but the two
co-stars are seen more as ensemble stalwarts than as budding stars.
Hayes is a zany motormouth in a hot show, and MacNicol is a zany
motormouth in a terrible show, so the race is shaping up to be
between Pierce and Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: Pierce, because Emmy voters don't have a
compelling reason not to go with the tried-and-true.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Hayes. He combines physical comedy, impeccable
timing and solid acting into a performance that's so high-energy
it's sometimes unnerving. But while Hayes is criticized for being
almost a caricature, it's his uninhibited exuberance that makes his
Jack a true original. He manages to create memorable comic moments
with each entrance and exit.
</P>
<P>
   Outstanding supporting actor _ drama
</P>
<P>
   Nominees: Michael Badalucco, ``The Practice,'' ABC; Dominic
Chianese, ``The Sopranos,'' HBO; Steve Harris, ``The Practice,''
ABC; Richard Schiff, ``The West Wing,'' NBC; John Spencer, ``The
West Wing,'' NBC.
</P>
<P>
   The Buzz: None of the actors has momentum going in, partly
because most of the nominees are new. One thing seems almost a
certainty: Badalucco, who surprised everyone last year by walking
away with the honor, can forget about repeating the trip to the
podium. He had a fine season on ``The Practice,'' but series
creator David E. Kelley is falling out of favor with voters. Harris
is in the mix this time around, but he'll suffer the same handicap,
despite managing to make viewers care about a character who only
has two emotions: angry and really, really angry. And Schiff and
Spencer are well-liked _ and ``The West Wing'' is garnering the
same enthusiasm that ``Ally McBeal'' did during its first season _
but the show is largely viewed as an ensemble piece in which no one
voice stands out.
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: Chianese, almost by default.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Chianese, because he makes his mobster's faults
so human. Much of last season, his Uncle Junior was under house
arrest _ getting him hooked on ``The Bold &AMP; The Beautiful'' was a
nice touch.

AUSTRALIAN E-CAFES OFFER COMMUNICATION AND MORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: in reference to Micheal O'Grady, spelling is CQ) 
 By JEAN E. HERSKOWITZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years ago, while touring Britain, Philip Dean had to use
Internet connections at local universities to e-mail home.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days there really weren't any Internet cafes there,''
said Dean, a 29-year-old British native transplanted to Australia.
His desire to communicate easily and cheaply with faraway friends
resulted in his opening Global Gossip _ ``a store with phone booths
and a couple of terminals'' _ along with Peter Ovenden, 31, after
Dean returned from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The store grew into a chain of 12 Internet and telephone
``lounges,'' spread across nine Australian cities. Visitors to any
of the communication centers can fax, phone, scan, rent a mailbox,
photocopy and send e-mail. Global Gossip's young owners are seeking
U.S.-based partners for global expansion.
</P>
<P>
   And Global Gossip isn't alone. As visitors to Australia for the
Olympics will find, they may be down under, but they won't have to
be out of touch. In the past three years, Sydney _ the capital of
the Australian state of New South Wales and its most populated
city, with 3.7 million residents _ has seen an explosion of
Internet cafes. As England, Israel and other countries have,
Australia has proved fertile ground for the spread of the cafes,
which are a big attraction to backpacking tourists.
</P>
<P>
   For them, e-mail is the preferred mode of communication. It's
less expensive than calling home (although some of the cafes offer
international calling amenities) and easier than postcards.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the 35,000 customers who pop into a Global
Gossip each week are between the ages of 18 and 29, according to
the site. Sixty percent are visitors from abroad. Local people
gravitate toward the faxing, photocopying and scanning services,
said Dean, who compared Global Gossip to a ``more fun'' Kinko's in
that regard. Australians with PCs at home also stop by, for the
social experience. ``There's atmosphere and energy,'' Dean said.
``People enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydney picked up e-cafe fever around 1997, when a few cafe
owners decided to perk up business by installing a smattering of
computers. When it soon became clear that the mouse pads were
getting more hits than the mocha, cybercafes began to be cloned in
every semi-inhabited corner of the Southern Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   A stroll around any urban neighborhood in Sydney bears out
Australia's affinity for the net. The cafes line the streets,
crammed with young people, their eyes glued to glowing screens,
fingers tapping frantically. Many cafes stay open past midnight.
And a number are located on the notorious Darlinghurst Road in the
Kings Cross section of Sydney _ the central strip of the city's
red-light district (fairly safe as red-light districts go) and a
backpacker's main stomping ground for low-cost room and board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Australia seems kind of ahead in this area,'' said 37-year-old
Dr. Sally Harrison, from England, who is working in a local
hospital for a year. Her explanation for the phenomenon:
Australians are ``obsessed with the fact that they're cut off from
the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Some cafes subscribe to the all-Internet, no-hoopla approach.
Sydney's Eagles Internet cafe is a ``stock, standard Internet cafe
that offers peace and quiet,'' according to its manager, Micheal
O'Grady. ``We don't crowd our room out with lots of people, and
only have a maximum of 12 people at once. Plenty of space and
nothing to interrupt them. It keeps them coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Competition, however, has made many cafe operators less spartan
about services offered, resulting in creative price arrangements
for jaded customers.
</P>
<P>
   Global Gossip offers patrons a stamp for each half hour they
spend online; those who collect five stamps receive a free
half-hour. Other cybercafes lure visitors in to check their e-mail,
offering the first two minutes free.
</P>
<P>
   The more experimental cafe owners have traveled beyond the
Internet in their quest for distinction.
</P>
<P>
   The 300-seat Fountain Cafe, on the edge of Kings Cross, offers
multitaskers access to one of 40 terminals in the downstairs
cybercafe, food and beer in the restaurant (the menu includes the
``Aussie burger with chips and soft drink and 1 hour on the Net''
for about $6 and salon services next door at the cafe's high-tech
beauty salon.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalind Turner, 43, an Australian freelance journalist, isn't
online at home, so she uses the Fountain's computers for the
Olympic stories she is working on. The cafe has ``lots of Swedish
accents, and lots of Irish and pommy accents,'' she noted.
(``Pommy'' is Australians' slang for the many Britons among them.)
``They know each other from the hostels.'' She likes the casualness
of the place. ``The owner lets people drink coffee and eat
hamburgers downstairs, so he's not really worried about greasy
fingers on the keyboards.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner appreciates the array of conveniences. ``I have a massage
every couple of weeks, I get a peel whenever I feel like it.''
After her massage she goes next door to the cafe, logs on and
checks her e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics are also getting in on the action. The Athlete's
Village will have a cybercafe _ the Surf Shack _ where the athletes
can respond to fans' e-mail as part of IBM's FanMail program.
``FanMail is a Web site we debuted in 1996 at the Atlanta Games,''
said Joyce Lagas, a communications employee with IBM's Olympic
project. ``It lets people from around the world send good luck and
congratulations to the athletes.'' The site is at
www.ibm.com/fanmail.
</P>
<P>
   IBM is also opening a Surf Shack for public consumption, which
will be floating on a barge in Sydney's Darling Harbor. People can
stop by to send e-mail to their favorite athletes, view the
Olympics Web site (www.olympics.com) and check out IBM technology
that was created for the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Olympic Village Surf Shack's official opening was
last Saturday, Lagas observed that team trainers, coaches and
officials had already been dropping in for weeks to e-mail their
families back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in 1996, the Internet was in its infancy, but still we
received over 100,000 e-mails for the athletes at the Atlanta
Games,'' Lagas said. ``Two years later, at the Nagano Games _ and
winter Games tend to be smaller, with fewer athletes _ we had
300,000 messages sent from 126 countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Will the ultradisciplined athletes succumb to the lure of the
Internet cafe? IBM thinks so. True, the 3,800-square-foot Athlete's
Village Surf Shack with more than 60 computers will serve no food.
But ``they can play computer games here,'' Lagas said, ``and we
also have a giant video wall set up,'' with a feed from the events
once the Games start.

 &HT;    Keeping the West on the silver screen
 &HT;    By Laylan Copelin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DRIFTWOOD, Texas _ Banks are being robbed, horses stampeded and
Jesse James is mounting the gallows _ in several takes _ near this
tiny Central Texas town south of Dripping Springs.
</P>
<P>
   As magical as film-making is, the creation of one of the
country's largest Western movie sets is just as fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   Where cows grazed on the Newberry family ranch in June, three
Western towns rise from the parched pastures. In about six weeks,
crews erected 42 structures _ facades, newly constructed buildings,
a borrowed Post Office and butcher shop. On any given day, they
change a few signs, move a building or replace plastic stone siding
with rough sawn wood and the movie set becomes another town.
</P>
<P>
   To really dress it up for an untitled Jesse James film,
designers use the four B's of Western sets _ boxes, barrels, bags
and benches.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many movie sets, this one in Hays County may hang around
longer than the film reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was our personal goal, to have a town here for filming in
the United States,'' said Janis Weinheimer, who manages the ranch
with her husband, Kim. In 1991, the Weinheimers introduced music
videos, still shoots and films as a way to increase ranch revenue.
Today, some 40 projects later, Austin-wood contributes as much to
the ranch's bottom line as cattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a way to stay in ranching,'' said Kim Weinheimer. ``It
gets harder every year.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1,650 acre ranch, which traces its roots to a land grant for
Alamo commander William B. Travis, has been depicted as everything
from Africa to Vietnam (at night) to Mississippi. And that was
before the erection of the Western movie set.
</P>
<P>
   The Weinheimers, the Newberry family and Morgan Creek
Productions, the makers of the movie about Jesse James, are
negotiating plans to leave the set intact. The City of Austin and
State of Texas are weighing in, saying a Western set would be a
magnet for more movie production.
</P>
<P>
   ``I very much would like to see it remain there,'' said Austin
City Council Member Will Wynn. ``I plan to lead the city effort to
research the role the city can play in this.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, no one has disclosed details of what public assistance,
if any, would be required to maintain, protect and promote the
movie set.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Copeland, the director of the Governor's Office of Music,
Film, Television and Multimedia Industries, has endorsed making the
set permanent. Ric Luber, executive director of the Austin
Convention and Visitors Bureau, said it could be worth millions to
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if someone would drop a factory in the middle of
Texas, for all the business it would generate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year there has been $135 million in movie production
in Austin, Luber estimated. Of that, about half stays in the local
economy, primarily from 600 Austin-based technicians who make their
livings in the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Cary White and John Frick are examples of Austinites behind the
camera. White is the production designer and Frick the art director
for the Jesse James movie. They've worked together on the
``Lonesome Dove'' mini-series and several movies.
</P>
<P>
   Their jobs, White jokes, is to litter the country with as many
forts, ranch houses, saloons and dry good stores as they can.
</P>
<P>
   The Driftwood movie set, if left to stand, would not be unique
to Texas. The set used for Willie Nelson's ``Red-Headed Stranger''
remains on the singer's property near Spicewood. Near Fort Davis is
the set for a mini-series called ``Dead Man's Walk.'' The
storefronts of ``Lonesome Dove'' still stand near Del Rio and the
fort from the epic ``Alamo'' looms near Bracketville, Copeland
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Driftwood set has one significant advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the zone,'' said Janis Weinheimer, speaking like a
Hollywood veteran who understands film grosses and union scale. In
movie parlance, in the zone means the set is within 30 miles of a
major city. That means lower overhead in less per diem, mileage and
other union perks.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ranching side-by-side with couple of hundred members
of a film crew can take patience _ on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bit odd to see speed bumps on a dirt road and signs that
read: ``Mandatory 10 MPH This Means You!'' The cattle like to drop
into the Jesse James homestead and chew on the film crew's wiring.
And when the commotion of gunfights, stampedes and bank robberies
become too much for ranch residents, Kim Weinheimer said,
``Sometimes you go out to talk to the cows.''

ADVERTISING: ABC AIMS TO OFFER ADVERTISERS EASIER, NOT CHEAPER,
BUYING 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The No. 1 television network in viewers and advertising revenue,
ABC, is reorganizing and expanding its sales and marketing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to offer sponsors an easier way to buy everything
and anything from commercials during ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' and advertisements in Disney Adventures magazine to
banner advertisements on ESPN.com and spots on a giant video screen
perched above the ``Good Morning America'' studio in New York's
Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   The refocusing of the ABC Television Network's sales operations
is to be accomplished through a new unit, ABC Unlimited, intended
to integrate and coordinate the purchase of commercial time and
advertising space by marketers across all units of ABC's parent,
Walt Disney Co., including broadcast, cable, syndicated and local
TV; radio; and print and online media. The changes, detailed
Tuesday at a news conference at the ABC office near Lincoln Center
in Manhattan, involves promotions and new appointments for five
executives as well as adding about 50 employees to a staff of about
150.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the ABC sales department had been widely considered
the most traditional among the broadcast networks, reflecting the
meat-and-potatoes, just-the-facts-ma'am approach of its longtime
previous parent, Capital Cities/ABC. By comparison, rival CBS, now
a part of Viacom Inc., formed CBS Plus, a division with a purpose
similar to that of ABC Unlimited, in November 1998. Cable companies
like the Turner Broadcasting System, part of Time Warner, have also
assiduously pursued sales across disparate properties.
</P>
<P>
   ABC is ``keeping up with the Joneses,'' said Marc Berman, media
analyst for the Mediaweek.com unit of VNU USA, who attended the
news conference to write about it for The Programming Insider, a
daily e-mail newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Divisions like ABC Unlimited, dedicated to what is known in the
media industry as as cross-selling, are ``something all the
networks have to think about,'' Berman said, as they seek to
improve their effectiveness by broadening their horizons at a time
when advertisers are turning increasingly to alternatives like the
Internet, promotional campaigns and cause-related marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The shift at ABC, described as the results of six months of
study, planning and testing, are emblematic of the attempts by
established media brands to keep abreast of upstart competitors
amid a rapidly changing landscape. One purpose is to wean marketers
from their long-held view of broadcast network television as only a
``cpm medium'' _ that is, one to be bought on the basis of the
lowest cost per thousand viewers achieved through tough,
confrontational bargaining, which diminishes perceptions of its
worth.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than sell ``the same way we've done it for many, many
years,'' said Alex Wallau, who became president of the network in
June after 25 years at ABC, the idea was to foster ``more
productive relationships and partnerships'' with marketers and
agencies by making ABC Unlimited ``the point of entry for the
entire range of media assets of the Disney company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge allocation of people and resources to something
that's at the heart of what we do,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ABC Unlimited will be headed by Mike Shaw, who becomes president
for sales and marketing at the ABC Television Network. He succeeds
Marvin Goldsmith, a longtime network executive who is being named
to the new post of executive vice president at the ABC Broadcast
Group, consulting on sales strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to advertisers with an integrated marketing approach
really is the key,'' said Shaw, 46, who is being promoted from
executive vice president and national sales manager, the No. 2 post
in the department behind Goldsmith, 59. Shaw will report to Wallau.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to sit down with advertisers at the beginning of the
process and find out their marketing objectives,'' then determine
how our various assets can respond to those needs,'' Shaw said.
``This is a long-term way of doing business.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last year under Goldsmith, ABC became the highest-rated
TV network as a result of the runaway success of ``Millionaire''
and broke revenue records with the telecasts of the Super Bowl in
January and the Academy Awards in March. In June, when commercial
time is sold ahead of the annual TV season, ABC set another record
by gaining commitments for about $2.4 billion worth of spots to run
in the 2000-2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC sales executives are ``at the top of their game,'' said
Joe Mandese, who attended the news conference in his capacity as
editor of The Myers Report, a media industry newsletter, so it ``is
very symbolic they're moving in this direction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the networks are talking about wanting to get a bigger
share of the budgets'' of major marketers, he added. ``It will be
interesting to see how this plays out.''
</P>
<P>
   Also involved in the reorganization is Laura Nathanson, 42, who
is being promoted to executive vice president and national sales
manager from executive vice president for prime-time sales. That
broadens her purview to include other aspects of the broadcast
schedule like daytime, news and children's programming.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bund, 46, is being named to the new post of senior vice
president for integrated sales. He had been manager for sports
sales for the Central and Western division of ABC Sports, which
recently underwent a similar reorganization of its advertising
sales operations, now handled by a new unit called ESPN/ABC Sports
Customer Marketing and Sales.
</P>
<P>
   And Dan Longest, 35, is being named to the new post of senior
vice president for integrated marketing and promotion, reporting to
Shaw. Previously, the network marketing department had reported to
Wallau. That change is intended to help foster closer cooperation
between the sales and promotion functions.
</P>
<P>
   One ``danger'' ABC Unlimited will try avoiding, Wallau said, is
succumbing to the pressure to lower prices that is typically
exerted by advertisers buying time and space across various
properties of a media giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make them understand and appreciate the value of
what we're doing,'' he added. ``If we can demonstrate value, we
will get money for that value.''

 &HT;    CLINTON OPENS UN SUMMIT WITH CHARGE TO 'REWRITE HISTORY', HOST
OF BILATERAL MEETINGS
 &HT;    With CLINTON-MIDEAST-0907.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ President Clinton used the largest gathering of
international leaders in history Wednesday to spar with his global
counterparts on issues ranging from nuclear arms control and human
rights to Third World poverty and the quest for Mideast peace.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a final formal bow as senior statesman on the global
stage, Clinton delivered a brief but wide-ranging valedictory
address to nearly 160 world leaders attending the United Nations
Millennium Summit, challenging the institution to embrace the
challenges of an uncertain world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders assembled here can rewrite human history in the
new millennium,'' Clinton said, speaking for his eighth and final
time as president to open the annual U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we must believe the simple things,'' he implored, ''that
everywhere, in every land, people in every station matter. Everyone
counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Shattering the optimism of the moment, though, tragedy struck
the organization just hours before Wednesday's proceedings began,
when militiamen attacked U.N. offices in the tense island enclave
of East Timor, killing three U.N. workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I much regret to have to open our proceedings on a somber
note,'' said U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   He asked leaders and diplomats to stand and observe a minute of
silence in the memory of those killed: Carlos Caseras of the United
States; Samson Aregahegn of Ethiopia; and Pero Simundza of Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tragedy underlines once again the dangers faced by
unarmed humanitarian workers serving the United Nations in conflict
or post- conflict situations,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton looked out from the U.N. podium onto a sea of faces
mirroring the diversity of the group and the era it serves, as
long-term U.S. foes such as Cuba's bearded dictator, Fidel Castro,
in a dark business suit, and Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, in
a long flowing black robe and wire-rimmed glasses, silently
listened to the remarks.
</P>
<P>
   In an unscheduled surprise, Khatami rose to address the assembly
_ he had been slated to speak several hours later _ as Clinton sat
in the chamber shortly after his own speech.
</P>
<P>
   With Secretary of State Madeleine Albright seated to his left,
Clinton listened as the voice of a female interpreter crackled
through a dingy plastic earpiece, as Khatami warned against the
dangers of ``a few power-holders'' exerting undue influence over
global affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nations can no longer be excluded or marginalized on
political, cultural and economic pretexts,'' Khatami said in a
lecture that appeared largely tailored to target the United States
and its major allies. ``No double standards, national or
international, can ever be accepted in
</P>
<P>
   the contemporary world.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, for his part, slammed the military junta that rules the
Southeast Asian nation of Burma, demanding the release from house
arrest of democratically-elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and
calling her ``a brave and popular leader.''
</P>
<P>
   And, with Indonesia's President Abdurrahman Wahid looking on,
Clinton pressed the government in Jakarta to rein in elements of
the Indonesian military that have assisted paramilitary groups in
violence against pro-independence forces in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was deeply saddened to learn of the brutal murder of the
three U.N. relief workers there by the militia,'' Clinton said. ``I
urge the Indonesian authorities to put a stop to these abuses.''
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. operation is administering East Timor, which voted last
year for independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid, who was steadied by two aides as he left the U.N. General
Assembly Hall after morning speeches, issued his own statement,
expressing ``deep regret'' over the incident, and ordered an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the assembly hall for his opulent quarters at a
Manhattan luxury hotel, Clinton careened through a day of intensive
face-to-face diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   He met from morning until deep into the night with one leader
after the next, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Putin squared off over the future of a U.S. missile
defense system, with Putin insisting that such a weapon could upset
the strategic balance of power and perhaps even spark a global
nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders agreed, however, to conduct a joint assessment
of the threat a national missile defense (NMD) system would be
designed to defend against: the risk that a rogue state or
terrorist group might try to attack a major power with a long-range
missile tipped with nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced last Friday that he would not deploy such a
system, but the administration made clear Wednesday that the issue
would remain on the White House desk once Clinton's successor takes
office in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NMD issue is not off the table, it's not solved,'' Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott told reporters here. ``There is
going to have to be, over time, a change in the way that, not just
the United States, but other countries, too, pursue ...
anti-missile defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin, though, used his own U.N. address to attack the plan as
part of an effort to turn outer space into a battlefield. He called
for a U.N.-sponsored conference to prevent what he called ``the
militarization of outer space,'' and offered to host such a
gathering in Moscow next spring, if the U.N. adopts the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The NMD system under U.S. development combines powerful radars
and rockets to try to knock down incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Putin signed a Joint Statement on Strategic
Stability Cooperation, building on earlier documents the two inked
in Moscow in June and in Okinawa, Japan, in July.

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ President Clinton used the largest gathering of
international leaders in history Wednesday to spar with his global
counterparts on issues ranging from nuclear arms control and human
rights to Third World poverty and the quest for Mideast peace.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a final formal bow as senior statesman on the global
stage, Clinton delivered a brief but wide-ranging valedictory
address to nearly 160 world leaders attending the United Nations
Millennium Summit, challenging the institution to embrace the
challenges of an uncertain world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders assembled here can rewrite human history in the
new millennium,'' Clinton said, speaking for his eighth and final
time as president to open the annual U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we must believe the simple things,'' he implored, ''that
everywhere, in every land, people in every station matter. Everyone
counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Shattering the optimism of the moment, though, tragedy struck
the organization just hours before Wednesday's proceedings began,
when militiamen attacked U.N. offices in the tense island enclave
of East Timor, killing three U.N. workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I much regret to have to open our proceedings on a somber
note,'' said U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   He asked leaders and diplomats to stand and observe a minute of
silence in the memory of those killed: Carlos Caseras of the United
States; Samson Aregahegn of Ethiopia; and Pero Simundza of Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tragedy underlines once again the dangers faced by
unarmed humanitarian workers serving the United Nations in conflict
or post- conflict situations,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton looked out from the U.N. podium onto a sea of faces

CLINTON TO WORLD LEADERS: IT'S TIME TO END CONFLICTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Standing before the largest ever gathering of
world leaders, President Clinton Wednesday made a plea to his
audience to end conflicts around the globe, including a pointed
reminder to the Israeli prime minister and the Palestinian
president that the moment to end their history of enmity was
``fleeting and about to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a moment to lose,'' Clinton said directly to
Israel's Ehud Barak and the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Clinton plunged into separate talks with Barak and
Arafat only nine blocks from the United Nations headquarters, but
US officials were careful to play down expectations, saying the
likely outcome would be more discussions and not a hasty return to
the presidential Camp David compound at week's end.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks ago the Israeli-Palestinian talks ended with no deal
at the Maryland retreat, but the two sides had engaged in
unprecedented discussions on the core issues that divide them,
including the future of the holy city of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   But as Clinton, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and others
called on leaders to find ways of compromise to defuse flareups,
Russian President Vladimir Putin Wednesday unleashed an arrow at
what many world leaders perceive as the dangerous US consideration
of a missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton last week postponed a decision on missile defense
to allow his successor to make the choice, Putin, without
specifically mentioning the US idea, said that militarization of
space was ``particularly alarming.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first man
in space on April 12, 1961, he suggested holding an international
conference next year in Russia on the 40th anniversary on the uses
of space.
</P>
<P>
   And heaping more derision on the United States was North Korea,
which denounced the superpower as a ``rogue state'' _ turning a
phrase often employed by Washington against it. North Korea, which
boycotted the meeting, claimed the US government was responsible
for allegedly ordering a search of members of the delegation as
they switched planes in Germany. American Airlines apologized for
the search and said no US government agency took part.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day meeting of kings, monarchs, presidents, prime
ministers and other dignitaries from 189 nations opened a half-hour
late due to the hobnobbing of dignitaries. And then came speeches
from 63 leaders, with the unlikeliest of bookends, Clinton kicking
off the summit and Cuban President Fidel Castro closing it
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Annan strove to inspire world leaders to think beyond their
national concerns for the good of all people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems seem huge,'' he said, listing poverty, the AIDS
epidemic, wars and environmental degradation. ``But in today's
world, given the technology and the resources around, we have the
means to tackle them. If we have the will, we can deal with them.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton also packed a paragraph with broad themes _ he
particularly mentioned the need to fight malaria, tuberculosis and
AIDS, which cause a quarter of all deaths in the world; the need to
stimulate the development of affordable drugs and vaccines; and the
need to make peace more profitable than conflict by shutting down
diamond and drug industries from Angola to Colombia _ the issue of
peace dominated his thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, he noted, wars have claimed the lives of
more than 5 million people around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The toll was underscored Wednesday with the news of three UN aid
workers killed in West Timor. The assembly began with a moment of
silence in their memory.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his eighth and final address to the world body as US
president, said it was about time that the United Nations build a
peacekeeping force that was better armed and could deploy quickly
to the world's troublespots.
</P>
<P>
   As his daughter Chelsea looked on, Clinton also turned
reflective, and drew upon his experiences around the world in
trying to settle conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have learned anything in these last eight years, it is,
whether we like it or not, we are growing more interdependent. We
must look for more solutions in which all sides can claim a measure
of victory and move away from choices in which someone is required
to accept complete defeat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``That will require us to develop greater
sensitivity to our diverse political, cultural and religious
claims. But it will require us to develop even greater respect for
our common humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks could be read as universal, pertinent to any
conflict, but they were made with the Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those who have supported the right of Israel to live in
security and peace, to those who have championed the Palestinian
cause these many years, let me say to all of you: They need your
support now more than ever to take the hard risks for peace. They
have the chance to do it. But like all life's chances, it is
fleeting and about to pass,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat, in public comments, both seemed to hold firm
to their positions, offering little hope for a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, in his speech before the summit, said Israel already had
shown it was ready to compromise for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It remains to be seen whether our counterparts (the
Palestinians and Syria) are also capable of rising to the magnitude
of the hour,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Jerusalem ``the eternal capital of Israel,'' Barak said
a peace deal would also reflect Muslim and Christian links with the
city.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of Arafat, he said, the two were ``at the Rubicon,
and neither of us can cross it alone. ...The opportunity for peace
in the Middle East is now at hand and must not be missed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat told reporters, ``I am sure I will not be flexible
with the holy places because the holy places are not only
Palestinian. It's Palestinian, Arab, Christian and Muslim holy
places, and everybody has to respect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian legislators are scheduled to meet over the weekend
to discuss whether to unilaterally declare a state on Sept. 13 _
the end date of the Oslo peace process _ or to postpone it until
later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Palestinians' decision, Barak said UN members
could help the process by opposing any unilateral measures.
Listening, through a set of headphones, was Arafat, whose face
masked his thoughts. Although Clinton met Arafat Wednesday night
after talks with Barak, the Israeli and Palestinian leaders were
not scheduled to meet over the three days in New York.

PROSECUTOR BECOMES A CELEBRITY IN BRAZIL BY ROOTING OUT
CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil _ To his enemies, whose numbers seem to be
growing by the day, Luiz Francisco de Souza is ``the Torquemada of
Brasilia,'' a reincarnation of the fanatic priest who commanded the
Spanish Inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   But de Souza is a federal prosecutor, not a cleric, and he
bristles at the suggestion that he is engaged in anything other
than a crusade to bring honesty, openness and accountability to
government here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more the truth is hidden, the easier it becomes for
iniquity to reign,'' he said in an interview. ``There is a lot of
corruption in Brazil, and many things to be ashamed of, but we also
have a Constitution that clearly spells out the functions and
attributions of a prosecutor, and those are to defend the
democratic order and morality in administration.''
</P>
<P>
   De Souza owes his controversial image and sudden prominence
primarily to an investigation he is leading into the whereabouts of
nearly $150 million that vanished during the still unfinished
construction of a federal courthouse in Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of his efforts, a senator was recently expelled from
office for corruption and the chief labor court judge in Sao Paulo
is now a fugitive, with his bank accounts frozen and posters
seeking his arrest on display at every airport.
</P>
<P>
   But even before that case put him in the national spotlight, de
Souza, 38, led a separate inquiry that forced the lower house of
the Brazilian Congress to banish one of its members, a former state
police chief, now jailed for his part in the murders of dozens of
opponents and criminals, some of whom were butchered with chain
saws and thrown into acid baths.
</P>
<P>
   And after prosecutors found that cabinet ministers and other top
officials were flying to beach resorts on air force planes at
taxpayer expense, a law was passed banning that practice.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most astonishing of all to Brazilians, who are
accustomed to seeing favoritism and nepotism at high levels go
unpunished, is that de Souza and his team have not hesitated to
make their own colleagues targets when malfeasance is suspected.
After a prosecutor in Sao Paulo, for example, was recently found to
have received a $51,000 check from a figure involved in the
courthouse case, they ordered an investigation opened against him,
too.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, the targets of de Souza's prosecutorial
zeal are none too happy these days.
</P>
<P>
   One exasperated bureaucrat last month labeled the federal
prosecutor's office here ``a judicial loony bin.'' And with
municipal elections scheduled for October, members of Congress have
accused de Souza of trying to advance his own career and the
interests of opposition parties at their expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you are doing wounds the sensibilities of many people,''
Sen. Pedro Simon, a prominent member of the government coalition,
complained at a recent congressional hearing. ``A prosecutor sends
some mayor from a town in the interior off to jail and he becomes a
star on television.''
</P>
<P>
   But de Souza's efforts seem to delight and amaze the average
Brazilian. On the streets, the lanky litigator is recognized with
increasing frequency, and is often greeted with pats on the back,
thumbs-up signs, honks from car horns or shouts of encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the bastards squirm,'' Evandro Vieira Milhomen, a waiter
here, said approvingly of those who have been caught up in de
Souza's investigative web. ``It's about time that somebody called
the rich and powerful to account and made them understand that the
law applies to them too, and not just to us poor folks.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of de Souza's appeal is the novelty of the crusading
prosecutor, a figure who, while quite familiar in the United
States, is not common here. In fact, until the ratification of the
constitution drawn up after the fall of a military dictatorship
here in 1985, one of the main duties of the ``Public Ministry,'' as
the prosecutor's office is known, was to defend the federal
government against lawsuits and provide legal counsel to the
executive branch.
</P>
<P>
   But the current constitution, dating from 1988, not only set up
a separate Advocate General's post to fill those functions, it gave
prosecutors a whole gamut of new powers to ferret out wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Today, their responsibilities include the ``defense of the
judicial order, the democratic regime and of social and individual
interests,'' ranging from the environment and monitoring the
behavior of police forces to assuring Indian and consumer rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what they are doing is wonderful,'' said David
Fleischer, president of the Brazilian chapter of Transparency
International, the anti-corruption group. ``They are filling a
void, playing a role like that of the Government Accounting Office
or the Inspector General'' in the United States and ``doing what
the executive and legislative branches really ought to be doing
themselves but are not.''
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, de Souza would seem an unlikely candidate for
the role of the defiant defender of the public interest. He is
mild-mannered in the extreme, even timid, is gawky and slightly
hunchbacked, tends to mumble in a child-like voice when confronted
by a battery of cameras or reporters, and has ascetic personal
habits that the newsmagazine Veja describes as ``eccentric.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a society used to seeing the rules bent, it is precisely
de Souza's rectitude that seems to have made him a celebrity. A
former Jesuit seminarian who reluctantly gave up his religious
vocation because of health reasons, he still lives with his parents
in a modest house here, drives a battered old Volkswagen Beetle,
donates part of his $4,500-a-month salary to charity and has only
one known extravagance: a personal library of some 7,000 books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like those possessed by divine fire, Luiz Francisco is austere
and simple,'' Veja reported in a profile last month. ``He has two
sports jackets, one single pair of shoes, and his few shirts are
all identical and white.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingenuous or not, de Souza and his colleagues have so irritated
the government that a proposed ``gag law'' to prohibit prosecutors,
judges and police from making any public comment whatsoever on
pending cases, with violators subject to fines of up to $125,000
and three years in prison, has now been revived and sent to
Congress. De Souza's response, however, is that what Brazil needs
is more publicity about official misbehavior, not less.
</P>
<P>
   ``That court building was only able to get so much money from
the government because for years the work of the auditors who were
investigating it was held under lock and key,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Prosecutors has also condemned the
initiative, arguing it would only hobble the work of public
officials who ``work tirelessly to fulfill their constitutional
duty to defend the public patrimony.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The function of all the great biblical prophets was to go to
those who rule and say `you cannot do this,' to denounce illicit
actions even at the cost of their own lives,'' de Souza added. ``It
is amazing that we are now in a new millennium and we still have
people who are trying to silence those who dare to open their
mouths against infamy.''

FLEET INVESTMENT UNIT ROBERTSON STEPHENS SEEKS IPO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Top executives of Robertson Stephens are trying to
persuade their parent, FleetBoston Financial Corp., to sell shares
of the investment banking group to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move would give Robertson attractive stock and options
incentives for employees, people close to the companies said. And
it would give Fleet large potential stock gains on a valuable
property.
</P>
<P>
   There is no imminent plan to take Robertson public, Fleet
sources said. But the Boston-based banking giant is said to be
mulling an IPO of a minority slice of the group, with Fleet keeping
a controlling interest.
</P>
<P>
   A Fleet spokesman declined to comment on the potential IPO. News
of the negotiations first appeared in Wednesday's San Francisco
Chronicle. Robertson Stephens is holding an Internet conference
this week in San Francisco, where it is headquartered.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said a partial IPO of Robertson _ known for taking
Internet and other high-tech companies public _ would make sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something you have to give consideration to,'' said Tom
Theurkauf, a senior vice president at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods in
New York. ``The brokerage stocks are on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping key talent is crucial to the investment banking
business, Theurkauf said. ``While Fleet's stock is attractive, I
think if you had a security that was a pure play on the investment
bank, that would be a very attractive employee retention option.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleet shares are trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 13,
while top investment banks are trading above 20. While Fleet shares
have risen 21 percent since January, the jump followed a deep lull
for financial stocks. From 12 months ago, Fleet shares are up just
6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet became Robertson's parent with its merger with BankBoston
Corp. nearly a year ago. BankBoston bought the investment bank in
1998 for $800 million, a price many believed was high at the time.
It was nearly 50 percent more than BankAmerica Corp. had paid for
the firm a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Robertson employees want a stock that reflects the
recent boom of their business, rather than a bank stock. Fleet has
earned nearly $250 million on Robertson's activities.
</P>
<P>
   The investment banking group ranked sixth in the nation for fees
earned on deals in the first quarter, at $72 million, according to
Thomson Financial Securities Data. But it fell to 13th in the
second quarter, as the Nasdaq market tanked, earning about $10
million.
</P>
<P>
   If the IPO market has been rocky for investment bankers in
recent months, however, the stock market has been generous to them.
Huge deals such as Credit Suisse Group's recent agreement to buy
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Inc. have fueled investor interest in
Wall Street firms.

ENCRYPTION FIRM TO RELEASE NEW CODE EARLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a key encryption patent about to lapse, RSA Security Inc.
said it would release its code two weeks early in an effort to
reassure investors its follow-on products will secure the company's
own sales.
</P>
<P>
   RSA's software is used to scramble digital text to make it safe
for Internet transmission. The company's early deals to have it
included in browsers made by Microsoft Corp. and Netscape
Communications made it a standard for sending credit-card numbers
and other information via the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is based on a 1983 patent assigned to the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and licensed to RSA, of
Bedford, Mass. It has enabled RSA to dominate the US market for
encryption software. Competitors have gained ground overseas,
however, and are vowing to sell more software at RSA's expense now
that the patent is ending.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Baltimore Technologies of Needham Heights, Mass.
said it plans to give away to software developers toolkits that RSA
would previously have claimed violated its patent. ``We're going to
set the market on its edge,'' said Andy Morbitzer, a Baltimore
marketing executive. Some percentage of these developers would
likely buy other Baltimore products, he said.
</P>
<P>
   RSA chief executive Art Coviello said he's not worried.
Royalties from its patent amounted to just around $550,000 of its
revenue of $218 million last year, he said, and the company has new
products ready.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the company rolled out a new version of its
``BSafe'' software to allow software developers to include features
for recognizing digital signatures and for securing wireless
signals.
</P>
<P>
   Like the old, the new software makes use of an encryption
algorythm protected by a patent. Coviello said the company decided
to release the code early to counter what he called
``misinformation'' spread by competitors that RSA would be less
competitive after the expiration.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, he said, sales have increased by 20 percent
this year following the lifting of export restrictions by the US
Commerce Department, which once was more concerned the software
could be used for incorrect purposes.
</P>
<P>
   RSA has about 1,000 employees, including 500 in Massachusetts.
The company was previously known as Security Dynamics, and changed
its name following its 1996 acquisition of RSA Data Security Inc.
of San Mateo, Calif. for stock worth about $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   RSA was founded by three former MIT students, one of whom,
Ronald Rivest, now teaches at the university. Coviello declined to
discuss the company's royalty payments to MIT but said they have
sustained a chair in the mathematics department there.

&HT;     CLINTON STEPS UP EFFORT ON HIS LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sept. 10)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While Al Gore and George W. Bush zoom from state to
state in search of votes, Bill Clinton blithely circumnavigates the
globe doing his own thing in his own way.
</P>
<P>
   With less than five months left in his presidency, Clinton has
intensified efforts to leave his mark on world and national
affairs. At 54,he is not yet ready for retirement or a final moment
in the spotlight of history.
</P>
<P>
   The recent record of his activities confirms that fact.
</P>
<P>
   One day he was in Africa promoting democracy and fighting the
AIDS epidemic, and the next day he was in Egypt conferring with its
leader, Hosni Mubarak, about peace in the Middle East. Then he was
off to Colombia to pledge more U.S. financial aid for the war on
drugs. From there, he dashed to Syracuse, N.Y., to bolster Hillary
Rodham Clinton's senatorial campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she can have an enormously beneficial impact for New
York all around the country and all around the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His next major stop was the United Nations to participate in the
Millennium Summit, a gathering of about 160 presidents, prime
ministers, kings and generals. There he met with Israel's Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in a last-ditch effort
to bring the longtime foes together in peace.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. session also afforded him the opportunity to confer
with Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is prepared to do all he can to win the presidency for
Gore, but he has no intention of yielding his office and its many
perquisites before the moment _ noon on Jan. 20 _ decreed by the
Constitution for his successor to take over.
</P>
<P>
   The fascinating aspect of Clinton's peripatetic efforts to leave
behind a record of achievement is that, for all his troubles and
scandals, he remains the most formidable figure in American
political life.
</P>
<P>
   That is true not just because he still bears the title
``president of the United States'' or because he can go where he
wants, when he wants on a Boeing 747 furnished by the federal
government. It is true because of his own talents and perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   That is the tragedy of the Clinton presidency. He is so
intelligent, so personable, so well motivated in most domestic and
foreign policy matters, but he was so unable to control his private
deportment. With his retentive mind and his vast knowledge, Clinton
undoubtedly is one of the most perceptive presidents of all time.
</P>
<P>
   As a communicator, he is almost as good as Ronald Reagan, who
entered the White House after decades as a movie and television
performer.
</P>
<P>
   It has been difficult for many Democrats to defend Clinton,
given his bad personal behavior. But he has put a new face on the
nation's oldest political party by taking a middle course on some
issues _ economic growth, welfare reform and crime reduction. Part
of the crime drop results from his program to add more than 100,000
officers to local police forces.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is prone to give his administration the lion's share of
credit for the surge in the economy, the balanced budget and the
surplus. The truth is that credit must be shared with Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and with business, labor and
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But it all happened on Clinton watch. Therefore, he is entitled
to great credit.
</P>
<P>
   Ideologically, Clinton is less overtly liberal than George
McGovern, whose presidential bid he supported as an anti-Vietnam
War activist in 1972, or Michael Dukakis, whose name he placed in
nomination at the 1988 Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton might have achieved more as president had his party not
lost control of both houses of Congress in 1994 and had he not lost
a year of achievement because of his misconduct with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Some presidential observers tend to lump him with Richard Nixon,
who was immobilized by the 1972 Watergate scandal and forced to
resign. It is true that a strong strain of deviousness ran through
both men and that they both lied to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   But Nixon, in an illegal invocation of presidential power,
sought to obstruct justice by using the CIA and FBI to cover up
criminal acts. His administration's crimes and dirty tricks sent a
host of government officials to prison, and Nixon himself was named
as an ``unindicted co-conspirator.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did lie under oath about his relationship with Lewinsky,
but he did not seek to use government agencies to obstruct justice.
Despite his acquittal in the Senate's in the impeachment trial, he
remains in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Robert Ray, the successor to Kenneth Starr,
has impaneled a new grand jury to decide whether the president
should be indicted on criminal charges once he leaves the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   As long as he lives, Clinton's character defects will be fair
game for biographers and political critics. His actions will make
colorful reading and television viewing for decades to come.
</P>
<P>
   In his memorable farewell speech to the Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles last month, Clinton defended and extolled
the record of his presidency. Then as delegates cheered and wept,
he dramatically declared: ``The best is yet to be _ if we make the
right choices ... the future of our country is in your hands. You
must think hard, feel deeply and choose wisely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, keep putting people first. Keep building those
bridges. And don't stop thinking about tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   If Nixon was a human phoenix, rising from the ashes of defeat,
Clinton is even more so because he never let scandal and adversity
rob him of the presidency.

FBI REPORT OFFERS VIOLENT-STUDENT WARNING SIGNALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT S. GREENBERGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teachers and principals should be wary of students who make
threats and are fascinated by bloodshed, who seem unusually
heartbroken over a breakup or who admire destructive figures such
as Satan or Hitler, according to an FBI report on school violence
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The School Shooter: A Threat Assessment Perspective'' lists 28
personal traits that may indicate if a student who has threatened
to commit a violent act is serious about carrying it out. The
36-page report, which is based on two years of research, also
details school and family conditions that can breed violent
behavior in children.
</P>
<P>
   The chief author of the study emphasizes that it should be used
to evaluate the seriousness of threats, not all students.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say that many of the identified traits could apply
to almost any teenager. They also worry that the report could lead
principals and teachers to overreact at a time when school violence
is actually on the decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get the feeling that they're responding to public pressure
and media coverage that has made the public feel that this is a
greater danger than it is,'' said Vincent Schiraldi of the Justice
Policy Institute, a Washington research group that focuses on
juvenile justice issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this gets used inappropriately, it's not a stretch to
imagine school principals coming up with lists of the ten most
dangerous kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In compiling the report, the FBI examined 14 school shootings
across the country and four cases in which police thwarted an
incident after ``significant preparations'' had been made.
Researchers interviewed the offenders, witnesses, and people who
knew the students and their families. They also analyzed crime
scene photographs and videos.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a fascination with bloodshed, romantic difficulties and
negative role models, the researchers found that many of the
shooters had trouble controlling their anger, were prejudiced
against minorities, or were alienated from their peers.
</P>
<P>
   Other potentially problematic personality traits, according to
the study, included ``a lack of empathy,'' an ``exaggerated sense
of entitlement'' and an ``attitude of superiority.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that many of the shooters' families did
not impose discipline, and that the perpetrators had unsupervised
access to television, the Internet and weapons. The families also
lacked intimacy or closeness.
</P>
<P>
   In reviewing the schools which had become crime scenes, the FBI
found that many of them had an ``inflexible culture'' that was
insensitive to the needs of newer students and staff. There often
was a pecking order among students, and a sense that discipline was
meted out unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   The study also ranks threats in terms of their seriousness,
emphasizing that those that are specific and plausible are the ones
that should be heeded.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the factors match those outlined in a Massachusetts
school violence report produced by the Governor's Advisory Council
on Youth Violence. Gov. Paul Cellucci launched the panel in 1998 _
before Columbine but after a spate of less deadly school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Everett, Mass. Superintendent Frederick F. Foresteire, a member
of that council, says the fact that none of the school shootings
has taken place in the Commonwealth is ``not luck.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's being on top of the issue and hearing students, listening
to students,'' Foresteire said. ``I don't care if it's academic
difficulties, the difficulties in their homes, or difficulties with
their peers. If they've got a shoulder to lean on, they'll get
through it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Massachusetts experience also illustrates the potential
for overreaction.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, for example, a 15-year-old Leominster special-needs
student was expelled for drawing a picture of his school surrounded
by explosives. That same month, the Boston public schools
overturned the suspension of a student who wrote a horror story
that featured a student seemingly taking a chainsaw to his English
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Special Agent Mary Ellen O'Toole, the chief author of the study,
stresses that it should be used to assess the seriousness of a
threat, not to isolate difficult or troubled children.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you never made threat in school, this framework model
should not be used as far as you're concerned,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But some fear that teachers and principals won't get that
message.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's useful information from a clinical point of view, but to
repesent this as a tool for schools is problematic,'' said Nancy
Mullin-Rindler, who heads the Project on Teasing and Bullying at
Wellesley College. She also advised the state on its new
anti-bullying initiative, which recently issued its first set of
grants to six elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although they carefully stress that this isn't a profile. the
fact is you're going to have schools that are going to latch onto
this and say, `this is what we're going to do.'''

 &HT;    Nigerian president, emigres plan talks here
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _In the last years of the 20th century, as Nigeria
suffered under years of repression, misrule and outright
governmental theft, many of the country's best-educated
professionals fled the country.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, who was
elected last year, will visit Atlanta to try to convince those
professionals things back home have changed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he will solicit their advice and ask for their help
in rebuilding the country, either with their talents or their
money, Joe Keshi, Nigeria's consul general in Atlanta, said
Wednesday. The country needs the services of the Nigerian doctors
and professors living in the diaspora, and it needs investment as
well, Keshi said.
</P>
<P>
   By rights, Nigeria should be prosperous. With 123 million
people, the west African nation, which is about twice the size of
California, is Africa's most populous. The country is rich in oil,
pumping 2 million barrels of crude out of the Niger Delta region
every day.
</P>
<P>
   But 16 years of military government left the country
impoverished, its infrastructure in disrepair, its government
institutions corrupt and its ethnic and religious groups vying for
power. From 1993 until his death in 1998, dictator Sani Abacha is
believed to have diverted several billion dollars into his personal
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Since his inauguration in May 1999, Obasanjo has been consulting
groups inside Nigeria on how to rebuild the country, Keshi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president does not want to exclude Nigerians in the
diaspora,'' Keshi said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, apparently, do Nigerians in the diaspora want to be
excluded. The consulate originally planned for 500 people. Now
organizers expect two or three times that many to attend, and they
are concerned about logistical problems if people show up Saturday
without advance registration.
</P>
<P>
   More than 8,000 Nigerians live in metro Atlanta, Keshi said. But
the conference will be attended by Nigerian professionals from
across the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo's willingness to seek advice has impressed even some
critics. Femi Shotomide King, president of the Vanguard for
Democracy and Justice, a group of Atlanta-area Nigerian activists,
has criticized corruption in government, the ineffectiveness of
national police and Obasanjo's refusal to call a national
conference on the country's future.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, King praised the president for soliciting the
opinions of Nigerians in the United States. King said his biggest
fear is that the conference will prove to be a lot of talk with no
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Obasanjo is a very good man,'' King said. ``He has a
good intention. He has a vision. But I hope the people surrounding
him in the government can actualize the vision and bring it to
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference will convene at noon Friday at the Georgia
International Convention Center at 1902 Sullivan Road in College
Park. Obasanjo will join the conference Saturday.

uncomfy symptoms that leave you with just enough energy to moan and
curse your fate. A few weeks ago, you could have trudged down the
hallway to your parents' room, groaned out a pitiful ``Mommy!'' and
gotten the Florence Nightingale treatment with items pulled from a
well-stocked medicine cabinet. But now, you're staring bleary-eyed
at your wilted reflection in the dorm's community bathroom mirror.
Although packing for your freshman year of college took
approximately two weeks (allowing time for you to smuggle away your
parents' smaller appliances and replace that perfect pair of
first-day-of-school boots with a really perfect pair), the
nonessentials managed to crowd out the true necessities.
</P>
<P>
   It stands to reason that semesters filled with sleepless nights,
course-related stress and abysmal eating habits will call for some
first aid. Instead of dragging that lifeless body to the pharmacy
in the throes of yuckiness and grabbing the first over-the-counter
drug in sight, be prepared ahead of time. Tina Dooley, assistant
chief pharmacist at UT's Health Services Pharmacy, runs down a few
items you won't regret stock-piling.
</P>
<P>
   There are myriad reasons that your body succumbs to head colds _
lack of sleep, stress, poor diet, etc. _ and odds are the average
student's touch-and-go lifestyle will eventually carry him/her
through all of them. There's no (good) excuse for missing class if
you use the right medication.
</P>
<P>
   Robitussin DM is a cough suppressant that loosens and relieves
chest congestion without causing drowsiness.
</P>
<P>
   Seven-layer burritos, nachos and cinnamon twists do not a
balanced meal make. Because your knowledge of this fact will remain
on your brain's back-burner for many semesters to come, supplement
your junk-filled diet with a daily dose of multivitamins.
</P>
<P>
   _Contrary to popular collegiate belief, the back of your
roomie's hand is not an accurate gauge for fevers. Instead, opt for
a quick and easy portable oral thermometer.
</P>
<P>
   _Tex-Mex dining has the potential to go very wrong, very
quickly, especially for Northerners who don't know a serrano from a
bell. For immediate relief of heartburn and acid indigestion
there's Maalox.If you just couldn't say no to those extra dollops
of guacamole and queso, try a longer-lasting formula like Zantac 75
(it can be taken up to 60 minutes before the onslaught of onions
and ancho).
</P>
<P>
   _Non-Texan-- may have never driven as much in their lives as
they will in the next four years of Lone Star living. Impromptu car
trips to away games, spring break haunts and roommates' hometowns
may leave you somewhat queasy, so try Dramamine, or any other
tablets with dimenhydrinate, to prevent or treat motion sickness.
</P>
<P>
   _Blaring stereos to the left of you, shouting matches to the
right and mind-boggling equations staring up at you. Faced with
such adversity, there's no way to avoid a pulsing headache, but you
can cure it with Aleve, which Dooley recommends for its overall
versatility _ it relieves headaches, muscle pains, menstrual pains
and reduces fever and swelling, as well.
</P>
<P>
   _Never had to wrestle with bothersome seasonal allergies before?
Welcome to Austin, where no one seems immune. For your garden
variety symptoms (pun surely not intended), go with a sinus and
nasal decongestant like Tavist D. Because it's an antihistamine, it
may cause drowsiness and shouldn't be mixed with alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   _In case you had to learn the hard way that you need to wear
flip-flops in the dorm showers, Lamisil AT (with terbinafine
hydrochloride cream 1 percent) offers a prescription-strength cure
for athlete's foot and other minor foot foibles.
</P>
<P>
   _You may pride yourself on a consistently clean bill of health,
but never underestimate the awesome power of your own clumsiness.
Keep a first aid kit handy, complete with antiseptic wipes for
cleansing minor wounds, burn cream, sterile nonstick pads, adhesive
bandages, pain relievers, gauze and antibiotic ointment.
</P>
<P>
   _For the not-so-happy-camper who's been felled by plagues of
mosquitoes or poisonous foliage, there's hydrocortisone cream 1
percent (that's the maximum strength) to treat not only insect
bites and poison ivy/oak/sumac, but rashes caused by soaps,
cosmetics, detergents, etc.
</P>
<P>
   _Now it's clear that you shouldn't have ventured
south-of-the-border thinking that water warning was an old wives'
tale. Immodium A-D (containing Loperamide HCl) is a relatively
on-the-spot anti-diarrheal caplet.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Of course, if symptoms persist or if you think your health
woes indicate a more serious problem, you should consult your
physician.

BUSH CHIDES GORE OVER UNKEPT PROMISES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Governor George W. Bush, under fire for refusing
to sign on to a bi-partisan debate schedule, gambled Wednesday that
he could turn the controversy to his advantage with a new round of
negative advertisements accusing Gore of avoiding some debates
himself.
</P>
<P>
   It was part of a multiple offensive, as Bush attacked Gore's
economic policies, then flew to Wisconsin to address a veterans'
convention that Gore had decided to skip. Unusually aggressive
throughout the day, Bush questioned his opponent's credibility,
saying candidates ``shouldn't be making promises they cannot
keep.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ads and on the stump, Bush said Gore could not be trusted
_ not to keep his word on the presidential debates, not to
prudently use the federal budget surplus, not to be commander in
chief of the armed forces. Bush, looking past the booming economy
and balanced budget of recent years, also predicted Gore would
mismanage the economy because ``his plan has been endorsed by Bill
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The new negative ad, titled ``Credibility,'' shows old
television clips of Gore agreeing, in comments to CNN and NBC, to
debate the Texas governor at any time and in any setting. It
highlights Bush's more recent agreement to joint appearances with
the vice president on those networks, and tells viewers Gore has
now backed away from doing so. The ad does not explain that Bush,
while agreeing to the 60-minute talk show appearances, has said he
will not participate in two of three 90-minute debates sponsored by
the bipartisan presidential debates commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't trust Al Gore on debates, why should we trust him
on anything?'' the voice-over in the ad says.
</P>
<P>
   The new spot is part of a Bush advertising array, now being
broadcast in as 21 battleground states, which includes another ad
sharply critical of Gore. In that ad, the Bush campaign contrasts
images of Gore at a Buddhist temple fundraiser with his pledge to
reform campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, responding Wednesday to Bush's criticisms, renewed his
call on Bush to participate in the three 90-minute debates. ``I'm
not going to play games to try to substitute a talk show for the
national bipartisan commission debates,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Bush concentrated his attacks on Gore Wednesday, the
vice president faced heavy criticism from numerous veterans
attending the American Legion national convention, especially its
national commander, Alan G. Lance. Introducing Bush as a keynote
speaker at the group's annual convention, Lance lambasted Gore for
refusing a similar invitation to address the thousands of veterans
gathered in Milwaukee this week.
</P>
<P>
   By declining, Gore became the first presidential nominee in
nearly a century not to speak before the group, Lance said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the entire history of the American Legion, this has never
happened before, and I cannot express to you how disappointed I am
that we will not hear the Democratic presidential candidate,'' he
told the 7,000-member crowd.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the Texas governor did not mention Gore's absence,
but he accused the administration of failing to keep the military
strong.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the armed forces are suffering under a series of budget
cuts, Bush vowed to restore morale to the military, as well as to
increase the pay of service personnel. Although military budget
cutbacks began in the administration of President George Bush, his
son held the Clinton administration responsible for sending the
armed services into disarray.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's get something straight, these are not criticisms of the
military,'' Bush said. ``They are criticisms of the current
commander-in-chief and the vice president for not providing the
necessary leadership for America.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush remarks were well-received, though at one point his tongue
slipped.
</P>
<P>
   Looking out at the mostly elderly crowd, the Texas governor
promised to make America the ``pacemakers'' in the world. What he
meant to say was that America would be the ``peacemakers, not the
peacekeepers,'' a phrase he includes in virtually every speech.
</P>
<P>
   But the crowd did not seem to mind. Indeed, when Bush concluded,
a group of veterans from Massachusetts _ almost all of them
registered Democrats _ said he had earned their vote.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gore's failure to appear was a ``slap in the face
to every veteran,'' said John Mulkern, 72, a World War II and
Korean War veteran from West Roxbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a registered Democrat, but I vote the way my conscience
says . . . George W. Bush,'' Mulkern said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm with him,'' interjected Frank Howley, 75, a WWII veteran
from Newton.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign had offered to send his running mate, Senator
Joseph I. Lieberman, citing a scheduling conflict. But the American
Legion rejected the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Bush came out on the offensive against the
Gore economic plan, which the vice president officially released
Wednesday. According to the Bush campaign, Gore had misrepresented
his programs to make it appear he was within spending limits. Bush
aides cited an example: Whereas Gore said his retirement savings
account would cost $200 billion over 10 years, a Republican Senate
report found it would cost $750 billion.
</P>
<P>
   All told, Gore would spend an excess of $900 billion, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to add up the numbers,'' he told a small but
enthusiastic crowd in Scranton, Pa. ``He spends the whole surplus.
He spends the entire surplus. He doesn't admit it, but we're going
to bring the accountants in and look at the numbers.''

TELEVISION'S BIG NIGHT OUT

   &QL; 
Hard-core Emmys fans may want to park a TV next to their computers
to take advantage of all the extras packaged on www.abc.com.
</P>
<P>
   For two hours before the telecast, users can check out arrivals,
including all the dirt on designers and jewelers, as well as
profiles of all the nominees. Come showtime, the Web site will
offer a fly-on-the-wall Emmy cam showing backstage activities in
the production trailers, press rooms and even dressing rooms.
</P>
<P>
   To watch the video stream and related games and trivia contests
in sync with the West Coast airing, look for the West Coast link.
Of course, if you're itching to know who won before the show is
over here, you can get all the answers from the East Coast link.
</P>
<P>
   That high-tech song and dance might help bring in more viewers.
Last year's show attracted only 17 million viewers, making it the
lowest-rated in nearly 10 years. (For comparison's sake, 51 million
viewers watched the ``Survivor'' conclusion and 46 million tuned
into last March's Academy Awards telethon.)
</P>
<P>
   By the way, don't wait until 11:01 p.m. to turn on the Emmys
telecast if you're expecting to catch the last big categories _
best comedy and drama series _ because this show honors its
three-hour time limit.
</P>
<P>
   Executive producer Don Mischer, an Emmy Awards veteran, said,
``It's not that we pride ourselves on (ending on time) _ we are
given no choice. We are told by the networks that carry the Emmys
that they want the show off the air right on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in the six years that I've done it, I think one year I
went over 18 seconds. That's part off the fun of doing live
television. We can't control a whole lot of this show. We don't
know who wins, we don't know what they're going to say. We have to
be real careful as we go through the three hours of live television
to make adjustments to get the show off on time.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, Mischer will be hanging out backstage with
Emmys host Garry Shandling, keeping one eye on the script and the
other on his precision watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about where we are, should we do this, add this,
should we write something about what just happened that we might
make a joke with,'' he said, praising Shandling's ability to think
on his feet and adapt to what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   There's no theme per se, but Mischer said the writers are
cranking up the comedy a few notches from years past. We wait with
bated laughtracks.
</P>
<P>
   _____ &QL;

A DEAD HEAT FOR BEST DRAMA EMMY?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use on or after Sept. 8, 2000, by NYTimes News Service
clients) 
 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Academy of Television Arts and Sciences feels your pain. It
knows you're sick and tired of the same actors winning the same
awards year after year _ why doesn't it save everyone the trouble
and just run repeats of previous years' ceremonies? And it
understands your grumblings that the tried-and-true, humdrum series
walk away with trophies intended for, as the categories themselves
state, ``outstanding,'' groundbreaking series.
</P>
<P>
   (Everybody's ripping off HBO's ``The Larry Sanders Show'' today,
but it won only two out of its whopping 50-something nominations.)
</P>
<P>
   So things, we have been informed, will be different this year.
First off, voting rules have changed. In the past, Emmy voters were
herded into cramped, filthy boxcars and railroaded off to luxury
hotels where they were locked into suites and forced to watch
television unrelentingly, until they came up with winners in some
873 separate categories and/or vowed privately to leave the
television business altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Which wasn't much of a sacrifice, since voters in the past have
usually been dismissed as folks who last worked when TVs were
called ``orthocon tubes'' and there was no such thing as cable, so
no one said a dirty word or disrobed.
</P>
<P>
   That's the popular explanation as to why HBO's ``The Sopranos,''
which everyone on the planet Earth but academy voting members
agreed was 1998-99's best series by a Jersey Turnpike mile, got
bupkis at last year's Emmys, a measly two trophies out of 16
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   This year, members of the academy considered edgy and
enlightened but too overemployed to sit in hotel rooms (to watch
TV, at least) were given videotapes of nominated series. So, at
their leisure, they either watched all or some portion of several
or many of the tapes, not fast-forwarding through the boring bits
!ital!on their honor, or at least knew enough to vote for the
coolest shows, even if they haven't seen them. Yes, this year, the
rules were changed so that ``The Sopranos'' could win and the
academy wouldn't look so staggeringly stupid and behind the times.
</P>
<P>
   Except that something happened along the way. Aaron Sorkin had
the visionary imagination to create, in NBC's ``The West Wing,'' an
upright, decent U.S. President untainted by scandal or politics as
usual who just wants to do what's right. And since there's no
science-fiction category in the Emmys, and since ``The West Wing''
shocked everyone by being a blue-ribbon network-TV series, there it
is, up for the Outstanding Drama trophy right alongside ``The
Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, anything that provides soaring uplift and smart, snappy
dialogue for the populace like ``The West Wing'' did week in, week
out is naturally going to be honored by any establishment with
``Academy'' in its name _ its network affiliation is just gravy.
There was, as well, a sense that a little spin fell off ``The
Sopranos''' fastball in Season 2 (true, but to a fairly negligible
degree). So unless those edgy sorts recruited by the academy feel
they have been charged solely to right last year's snub, look for
``The West Wing'' to win Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   That same rule change could affect the Outstanding Comedy
category, as well. Since everyone has pretty much gotten tired of
giving Emmys to ``Frasier,'' and since last year's winner, ``Ally
McBeal,'' was scarcely outstanding this year so is not nominated,
there would seem to be two other series duking it out for the big
award.
</P>
<P>
   CBS' ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' is a smart show draped in the
drab finery known as ``family sitcom,'' a show that audiences knew
was good long before the TV academy, which finally perked up last
year. The bad news for ``Raymond'' is that, as much as everybody
loves him, these new voters allegedly love the trendy stuff more,
and that's NBC's ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' a ground-breaking sitcom that's
so politically incorrect it's politically correct.
</P>
<P>
   So, whereas under the old rule, logic dictated that this would
be ``Raymond's'' year, the new rules suggest a tip to ``Will.'' In
fact, the battle is virtually geographical in TV-voter terms: It's
the Manhattan elite (``Will'') vs. the Long Island working class
(``Ray''). You know who wins that fight every time.
</P>
<P>
   There is one mitigating fact: ``Will'' is not nominated in the
writing category, while ``Raymond'' _ co-produced by HBO _ received
a key nod (for a priceless episode on PMS that'll go over big with
male voters, less so with women). But wait _ HBO's ``Sex and the
City'' received two. So maybe that's the hip Big Apple show that'll
win, but again, it's on cable and has those dirty words and naked
people that many voters may still be loathe to honor.
</P>
<P>
   And if that new band of edgy voters have their say, HBO's ``The
Corner's'' compelling smack addicts will caper away with the
Outstanding Miniseries Emmy, much to the chagrin of CBS' ``Jesus.''
But the academy works in strange and mysterious ways. Either way,
HBO's post-ceremony party will be the Hot Ticket, to glad-hand the
winners and/or grouse with the losers about the stinking academy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, prognosticating about who will win the acting categories is
playing a fool's game. Actors put up only a couple of performances
for consideration, so it's possible a couple of strong turns can
beat out a season's consistent good work (which can be the only
explanation for Kristin Johnston of ``3rd Rock From the Sun''
beating ``Raymond's'' Doris Roberts last year).
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, here are a few fool's guesses: Michael J. Fox will
receive a Lifetime Achievement Award in the guise of an Outstanding
Lead Actor in a Comedy Emmy for ``Spin City.'' James Gandolfini
will get the Emmy he should've won last year (which is not to say
that ``NYPD Blue's'' Dennis Franz doesn't deserve his warehouse of
Emmys) for ``The Sopranos.'' Jane Kaczmarek could ride the
``Malcolm in the Middle'' hype to a trophy for best comedy actress
(and could, in future years, become the John Lithgow in this
category). Julianna Margulies has plenty of baubles atop her mantel
but will likely get one last parting shot for her ``ER'' departure.
</P>
<P>
   Likely supporting performance winners:
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Nancy Marchand, not just because she's dead, but consider
fans' reaction to her death; now, try to imagine a similar reaction
to the loss of the characters played by the other nominees (though
Allison Janney's C.J. would be a sad loss for ``West Wing'').
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Dominick Chianese, because ``The Sopranos'' will grab any
award that doesn't fall off a truck.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Sean Hayes, because it'll be part of the ``Will &AMP; Grace''
statement (imagine him addressing Dr. Laura in his acceptance
speech!) and I think even David Hyde Pierce himself is tired of
winning.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Jennifer Aniston, because she's married to Brad Pitt, and
``Friends'' has generally been underrepresented at these
proceedings in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Here's my prediction most likely to come true: A month from now,
you won't remember most of the winners.
</P>
<P>
   And here are a few !ital!bonus observations about some Emmys
already awarded in a ghastly five-hour long ceremony a couple of
weeks back; not even winning one of these things is fair
compensation for sitting through that snoozefest:
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Outstanding evidence that the voters don't take their job
all that seriously: Cher's Vegas concert won an Emmy for its
costumes.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Outstanding proof that an Emmy and $4.75 will buy you a
cup of coffee: ``Freaks and Geeks'' won the Outstanding Casting
Emmy, but that didn't help it get renewed, now, did it?
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Outstanding confirmation that anything, really, can win an
Emmy: ``The 10th Kingdom,'' a miniseries even NBC executives
implicitly hated (and they were virtually its only audience, since
it stiffed), won for its title design.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Outstanding substantiation that there are wa-a-ay too many
Emmys: There's one for Outstanding Hairstyling for a Miniseries,
Movie or a Special. To differentiate from the hairstyling in a
comedy, a variety series, a drama or a non-fiction series.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Outstanding evidence that voters don't quite get the idea
of category definitions: A single program, ``American Masters:
Hitchcock, Selznick and the End of Hollywood,'' won the Outstanding
Non-fiction !ital!Series category, beating out Ric Burns'
monumental 12-hour documentary ``New York.''
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Outstanding indication that voters don't quite understand
the rules and/or simple math: ``Fail-Safe'' won for Outstanding
Technical Direction, Camerawork, Video for a Miniseries, Movie or a
Special (can they really engrave all that on such a tiny trophy?).
The rules state: ``To be eligible, a cameraperson must have
contributed at least 10 percent of !ital!on-air camera time. If a
cameraperson does not reach 10 percent, he/she is ineligible.''
Fifteen camera-people were named in the victory, which obviously
adds up to 150 percent of airtime.

ESSAY: ALL SINGING, ALL DANCING, ALL SURPRISING 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This fall will be a season of radical departures, with an
astonishing number of musicals from directors new to the genre and
an action film from a director who made his name with finely tuned
pictures based in the comedy of manners.
</P>
<P>
   The stretch would seem to be revivifying: many of the films have
a restorative vigor. ``Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' is a period
Hong Kong action film from Ang Lee, whose best-known movies _ ``Eat
Drink Man Woman,'' ``Sense and Sensibility,'' ``The Ice Storm'' _
have pinpointed, with refined comic feeling, the disruptive and
sometimes microscopic bumps in social interactions that lead to
discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's silken restraint is evident in ``Crouching Tiger,'' an
elegant, literally high-flying epic whose blade-swinging heroes
soar around on the wire rigs that are now a hoary tradition in Hong
Kong action movies. Lee's patience as a storyteller gives the film
a relaxed urbanity new to the genre; he has such deep-down
confidence in his cast _ Chow Yun Fat, Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi
_ and in his filmmaking skills that nothing feels rushed. It's a
gift he applies to a type of material he's never attempted before;
the graft takes.
</P>
<P>
   There's more genre-bending going on in the spate of musicals
arriving this fall, from the established directors Joel and Ethan
Coen (``O Brother, Where Art Thou?''), Lars von Trier (``Dancer in
the Dark''), Wong Kar-wai (``In the Mood for Love'') and Baz
Luhrmann (``Moulin Rouge'') and from the first-time feature film
director Stephen Daldry (``Billy Elliott''). Movie musicals were
presumed dead, both by audiences old enough to have grown up with
them and by younger viewers born into MTV, who had sought them out
as a source _ of either inspiration or pillage, depending on your
point of view _ for the music video. In their way, music videos
have kept the form's romantic impulse alive (while it looked as
though movie studios would never make another). And some filmmaking
techniques _ which started off as experimental but lapsed quickly
into cliche from overuse _ have taken these MTV and BET
mini-musicals into altogether different territory.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that in the films I've seen, directors are
using music to personalize their pictures. There's honest sentiment
in them, rather than the respectful entombment that has made the
occasional attempt to revive the form (in limp pictures like
``Evita'') such a letdown. Even a film that isn't, strictly
speaking, a musical, Cameron Crowe's ``Almost Famous,'' uses the
rock and pop of the early 1970s for its ability to voice feelings
and, eventually, heal wounds. (``Almost Famous'' is such a personal
statement for Crowe that its opening credits are scrawled in his
handwriting.)
</P>
<P>
   The Coen brothers, who have often made music a part of their
films, have gone into full-scale delirium with ``O Brother,'' a
lovely and assaultive pastiche that quotes from almost every
memorable movie ever made and whose musical interludes are employed
for their ability to soothe. Wong has woven music so deftly into
the textures of ``In the Mood for Love'' that the songs are on a
par with the images in the film's portrayal of heartsick desire;
``Love'' is all mood and music, a dream from a director who's
temperamentally unable to think in narrative terms. And he's free
of the kind of moist corniness that lies at the heart of all
traditional musicals _ a quality the Coens embrace and comment on
in ``Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   The one element these musicals share is that they're all period
pieces. ``Brother'' is set in the 1930s, and uses a digital
desaturation process that drains so much color from the film that
it's virtually black and white for a good portion of the running
time; ``Love'' is set in the early 1960s, as is von Trier's
``Dancer in the Dark.'' Even ``Billy Elliott'' (which was
originally called ``Dancer''), the story of a young boy in a mining
town who takes to ballet as a means of escape, is set in the past,
albeit in the more recent past. Its 1980s period is appropriate for
the what-a-feeling ``Flashdance'' plot turns _ even its climax
recalls ``Flashdance.''
</P>
<P>
   So while it looks as though musicals are in the midst of a
resurgence, it may still be true that directors haven't found a way
to use the form's conventions in a contemporary setting. (``Dancer
in the Dark'' and ``Moulin Rouge'' use new songs, but they can
still be said to be dependent on the past _ even if the warm
feeling on which they rely is merely nostalgie de la boue.)
Directors are taking advantage of the distance the musical form
imposes, rather than solving the problem that prevents musicals
from being a viable means of conveying contemporary concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is the ubiquity of the music video, which has turned
the show-stopper into a regular part of everyday life. Musicals
evoke a specific kind of joy, and nothing is as mesmerizing as
being drawn into a masterfully staged song-and-dance number on the
big screen: music videos have diminished that pleasure a bit by
miniaturizing it and making it commonplace. Directors whose
instincts are best suited for musicals are often filmmakers with an
eye for using space and creating tension in a confined area.
Directors as varied as the Wachowski brothers and John Woo have
those instincts _ and Woo has expressed an interest in the form,
which he should be allowed to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   That ability shows up also in ``Crouching Tiger,'' a picture
that has the range and radiance of a musical; maybe Lee should
think about turning himself in that direction next.
</P>

POTENT ALLERGY SEASON JUST A SNEEZE AWAY, EXPERTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost every fall the start of ragweed allergy season brings so
much misery so swiftly that sufferers believe it's the worst year
ever.
</P>
<P>
   So far, allergy experts say, the ragweed pollen count isn't
setting records. But, they note, the rainy summer nourished
outsized ragweed plants that are spewing millions of pollen grains
into the breezes that can spread ragweed as far as 400 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of severe patients today,'' Dr. Julian
Melamed, an allergist in Chelmsford, Mass., said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just saw a kid who was totally miserable, whose symptoms
were so severe'' that he was prescribed potent cortisone pills.
``I've seen half a dozen patients like this today,'' said Melamed.
</P>
<P>
   He added that some patients are suffering needlessly because
they didn't start their medications _ particularly steroid nose
sprays, which take days or weeks to work _ early enough in the
season.
</P>
<P>
   People who suffer from seasonal allergies or ``hay fever''
triggered by ragweed and other weeds start to react around August
15 each year. The warmer and dryer the weather, the more misery the
pollen inflicts, until the first frost nips the ragweed into
submission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine has been bad for the past two weeks,'' said Paul
Pressman, an architect who lives near Boston. ``I don't like to
take pills, but I've been resorting to my Claritin now.''
Otherwise, he said, ``my sneezing is annoying to people around
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides fall, there are two other allergy seasons. In summer,
grass pollens trigger sneezing from May to mid-July, and in spring
it's pollen from trees that begins the allergy year in January.
</P>
<P>
   The same moisture that disappointed so many vacationers in the
Northeast was a two-edged sword for ragweed allergies. Ragweed is
the most allergenic, or allergy-causing, plant in the country, and
its green-beaded shoots are found almost everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, the summer rains have sent ragweed plants shooting
up, said Melamed. ``The plants are really exceptionally big this
year,'' he said. Melamed is among scores of allergists who
voluntarily monitor pollen counts for the National Allergy Bureau
of the American Academy of allergy and Immunology.
</P>
<P>
   But while the plants may have flourished, the damp weather also
may have been keeping the airborne pollen from reaching the peaks
seen last year, said Dr. Martin Ostro, an attending physician in
allergy and immunology at Massachusetts General Hospital. But it's
early in the season, he cautions: ``If we get some Indian summer we
could really be in trouble,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 3.8 million school and work days combined are lost
each year because of allergic rhinitis, or hay fever, according to
the AAAI. The academy says 80 percent of people with bad seasonal
allergies have sleep problems that can lead to fatigue and
absenteeism.
</P>
<P>
   Allergies are the result of an overreaction by the body's immune
system to substances that aren't harmful. The cause isn't known,
but the tendency is inherited. This year, as in any year, some
people are being affected for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 10 percent of our patients say they haven't been
bothered before, or had only mild problems,'' said Ostro. It
doesn't mean the season is a particularly severe one. People often
begin to suffer allergies two or three years after they've moved to
a region and have become sensitized to the local pollen.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding pollen is the first line of defense for seasonal
allergies. That means keeping windows closed at night and using air
conditioners, which can be equipped with filters to keep pollen
out. People should watch pollen forecasts and try to do their
jogging or lawn-mowing when counts are expected to be low, staying
inside at other times.
</P>
<P>
   Over-the-counter drugs like Benadryl can quench sneezing and
itchy eyes but often cause drowsiness. Most people with bad
allergies are taking the new antihistamines like Allegra, Claritin
and Zyrtek that don't impair alertness, say the allergy doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Steroid nose sprays taken before the allergy season starts can
keep symptoms at bay. But some people find they cause too much
stinging in the nose and occasionally suffer from nosebleeds.
</P>
<P>
   Itching and burning eyes aren't always helped by systemic
antihistamines. Now there is a big crop of antihistamine eye drops
that go right to the source of trouble. They are sold by
prescription under names like Patanol, Alomide and Zadator.
</P>
<P>
   Even with these new remedies, the old desensitizing ``allergy
shots'' are still the most effective treatment for some people. But
they have to be given once a week for a long period of time and
tend to be expensive.

SERIAL KILLER IN ``THE WATCHER' IS ALL TOO FAMILIAR
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c. Houston Chronicle 
 
``The Watcher'' is both mundane and strange _ mundane for being yet
another serial-killer flick, and strange because this modest movie
has a major star.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like it or not, Keanu Reeves is such a star. Hits such as ``The
Matrix'' and ``Speed'' have pushed his fee to $15 million per
picture.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that he became pals with Joe Charbanic, having
bonded while playing street hockey. As a favor to the novice
director, Reeves signed to play a small part in his film for union
scale.
</P>
<P>
   It seems he also wanted to play a villain for a change _ at
least for a few days. But when Charbanic beefed up the part of
Reeves' serial killer, the actor was stuck.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves was miffed enough to have his name buried in ``The
Watcher's'' credits and his appearance downplayed in its marketing.
</P>
<P>
   For artistic reasons alone, you can't blame him. ``The Watcher''
is a numbingly familiar exercise in fear, disgorging regular doses
of grisly violence buoyed by precious little plot and pitifully
thin character development.
</P>
<P>
   Why does Reeves kill blameless young women? The film never
bothers to go there. Rather, it plays up a symbiotic link between
the killer and an FBI guy (James Spader) on his case.
</P>
<P>
   When first seen, Spader is so burned out that he's fled his job
in Los Angeles to settle in Chicago. There he pops pills, seeks
therapy and stares at the ceiling of his bleak apartment.
</P>
<P>
   But Reeves follows, starting a new string of murders by sending
Spader photos of his targets scant hours before an attack. A
reluctant Spader then shifts back into gear, leading Chicago's
police in pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Splashing women's photos on TV doesn't help much _ not in this
city, which differs from the Chicago of ``Return to Me.'' In that
romantic comedy, Chicago was a place of neighborhoods, friends,
families _ connections. In ``The Watcher,'' it's a city of anomie _
of isolation amid multitudes _ where no one knows you and no one
cares.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all stacked on top of each other, but we don't really
notice each other'' goes the lament. Yet any police failures seem
more a function of bad luck than community indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Spader is suitably tense, intense, haunted and haggard, though
his suffering loses its sting when he galvanizes from despairing
loner to well-tailored top cop.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves uses his usual dispassion (or is that flat acting?) to
good effect as the coldhearted killer. But this also makes him
flavorless, apart from a twisted pleasure in dancing with victims.
Whoa _ what character development!
</P>
<P>
   Marisa Tomei also appears, continuing her post-Oscar slump since
1992's ``My Cousin Vinnie.'' She's the one with the bit part: an
emotionally fragile psychiatrist who's merely a victim in waiting.
</P>
<P>
   As a music-video veteran, Charbanic directs predictably,
emphasizing flashy but incoherent visuals. Often changing film
stocks and speeds, he deliberately distorts images until they
collide in a stylistic junk heap. He also scores the movie with a
jarring mix of inappropriate pop songs and corny orchestrations.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his flourishes are so cliched they're an inadvertent
joke. Point-of-view shots with labored breathing seem like outtakes
from ``Scary Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The story is also standard-issue, for all its showboating about
Reeves and Spader ``needing'' each other. ``You're like a brother
to me,'' Reeves proclaims. ``We define each other.''
</P>
<P>
   A defiant Spader sets him straight, pointing out that serial
killers are common, and Reeves' crimes are just another ``job.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, serial killings aren't at all common, despite their
maddening overuse in movies. If Spader's character has reason to be
burned out by them, then so do filmgoers everywhere.
</P>

WILL SEGA SCORE BIG WITH FOOTBALL?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The football season kicked off in earnest this week, and
beginning today, another kind of big game is under way, this one
online.
</P>
<P>
   Today is the start of a make-or-break season for Sega, the
videogame company whose year-old Dreamcast videogame console
becomes the first to let its players take on opponents online, a
year before its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   While such capabilities have long been part of some complex,
high-end PC games, it's never been done with any videogame console,
which are designed to be plug-and-play simple.
</P>
<P>
   The move represents Sega's best chance to survive against
graphically powerful game machines coming in the next year from
giants Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reinventing this box,'' said Sega of America vice
president Charles Bellfield. ``This is content that you couldn't
get on any other machine.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right, at least for another year or two.
</P>
<P>
   Sony rolls out its PlayStation 2 in late October, and both
Nintendo's GameCube (whose details were finally announced about a
week ago) and Microsoft's X Box won't arrive here until fall 2001.
And none of those beefy opponents has said exactly when they'll
line up a network that connects owners of their machines to
opponents around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all kind of waiting for a couple of years, building
the infrastructure,'' said Tom Russo, editor in chief of Next Gen
magazine, a electronic gaming publication. ``I'm of the opinion
that it will be a big deal when it comes, but they have to build it
first.''
</P>
<P>
   Sega's competition is basically waiting for the full flowering
of the very fast connections made possible with broadband networks
such as cable modems and DSL phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   But the networks needed to provide homes with broadband are only
being rolled out now, slowly, in most neighborhoods around the
country. Betting on broadband gaming this year is a bad idea,
because it just isn't ready yet for most American households. So
Sega's competitors have decided to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Not Sega, which rolls out a videogame network that allows fast
and fun gameplay even at a standard, and relatively slow, 56-Kbps
connection.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this the next salvo in what Bellfield called ``the
battle for the living room.'' If Sega is going to remain in at
least a moderate number of American living rooms, it has to deliver
on the promise of Sega.Net.
</P>
<P>
   It's too soon to tell how the company has done. Though the
company has shown off the network in recent days, it hasn't been
available for home trials. But the demonstrations were promising.
</P>
<P>
   Sega built its own network out of the bones of Heat.Net, the
PC-oriented online gaming service it had been running. The
resulting Sega.Net is separate from but able to connect to the main
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The network has been further tweaked to allow for quick
reactions even with so-called fast-twitch titles such as sports and
fighting games, and also will handle some top PC games online, said
Lynn McConnell, Sega.Net's chief technical officer.
</P>
<P>
   Sega's first networked game is the NFL2K1 football game (more
than 800,000 copies were sold of the original NFL2K last year),
which also is being released today.
</P>
<P>
   With NFL2K1, Sega designed the game to dodge delays by reducing
the information that needs to be swapped across the network between
opponents, McConnell said. The result leaves room for players to
type taunts to each other during the game.
</P>
<P>
   A recent preview showing of NFL2K1 was impressive, as a San
Francisco opponent took on one in a Woodland Hills hotel room, with
no obvious delays, and excellent 60-frames-per-second video.
</P>
<P>
   The game itself has been tweaked and updated from last year's
terrific debut, with new juke and jump moves, the inclusion of all
teams' playbooks, and the addition of about 500 more
motion-captured player moves.
</P>
<P>
   And the network makes possible a realistic ``franchise'' mode,
where regular online updates of roster moves and injuries affect
the team a player builds and guides over an entire season.
</P>
<P>
   But the football game isn't the network's only title, or won't
be very soon. In all, Sega plans to release another 30 Dreamcast
games this year, all but one of them Web-enabled, Bellfield said.
</P>
<P>
   One interesting title, due at year's end, is Phantasy Star
Online, the newest version of a classic role-playing game. In this
version, translation software will allow players from the United
States to talk with and play against people from, say, Scandinavia
or Asia who don't speak the same language.
</P>
<P>
   Sega expects to add about 15 top PC games a month to the
service, until 150 PC titles are available, McConnell said. By
November, Sega.Net also will host an array of parlor and card games
for casual gamers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the idea is a great one,'' Russo said. ``I think that
people that do decide to go for it will probably be happy with it.
Once you get on with their service, for people who are really
looking for a multiplayer gaming service, I think it'll be good.
For the traditional console games, being able to play other people
around the country, I think that'll be the biggest draw.''
</P>
<P>
   Sega is also offering several deals on its machines, cutting the
Dreamcast price to $149 Sept. 1, and giving Sega.Net subscribers a
free keyboard when they sign up.
</P>
<P>
   Any current Dreamcast owner will get 50 hours of free online
play, then can subscribe to the service for $21.95 a month,
Bellfield said. Other deals, such as signing up for 18 months of
service, essentially give away the Dreamcast in exchange for the
subscription.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in Sega's best interest to get as many networked games
out there this holiday season as they can if they want to make this
thing fly,'' Russo said. ``Sony's got a lot of muscle. We're doing
a PlayStation 2 feature and we know of 200 games in the works for
that system.''
</P>
<P>
   The question now is, will Sega score a touchdown with its latest
venture, or it will it be sacked by the Fearsome Threesome lined up
against it? Not even Dennis Miller knows that answer.

 &HT;    Abdur-Rahim happy about playing on Olympic team
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - This is the summer that life changed for Shareef
Abdur-Rahim.
</P>
<P>
   He was selected to the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   He got married.
</P>
<P>
   What more could he want?
</P>
<P>
   ``A gold medal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's coming, too.
</P>
<P>
   And once the USA Men's basketball team conquers the world in the
Sydney Olympics, Abdur-Rahim should shed his reputation as ``the
best player in the NBA nobody knows.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, unless the Marietta native hits the Georgia lottery,
he's probably used up his good fortune for now. And that's just
fine by him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is enough, for sure,'' Abdur-Rahim said. ``It's a great
honor (to be on the Olympic team), and probably an honor I don't
fully understand right now and maybe won't until my career is over
something I'll look back on and tell my kids and, hopefully, my
grandkids about. It's going to be a big-time experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdur-Rahim, 23, is replacing Grant Hill. Now with the Orlando
Magic, Hill vacillated about accepting a spot because he was
getting married and the training would interfere with his plans. He
eventually backed out because of an ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Lakers' Kobe Bryant declined an invitation for
the squad because he was getting married and did not want to
interrupt his plans. When USA Basketball summoned Abdur-Rahim, he
had no problem accepting.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics had been a childhood ambition. And he was marrying
Delisha Hodges on Aug. 6, which was enough time experience the
nuptials, enjoy a honeymoon and still have time to relax before the
start of training in Hawaii. So, Adbur-Rahim never hesitated in
jumping at the selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know that I was in heavy contention to be named
on the team, and I found out kind of all of a sudden,'' Abdur-Rahim
said. ``I was out playing and got a call, and it was very exciting.
As far as me getting married, I think I (had) enough time to spend
at that time with my wife before we had to leave. I think it is
more of a situation where she is very excited for me. and I
probably would have had to fuss and fight with her not to go. She's
excited. I'm excited. She understands how much something like this
means to me, so for both of us and my family, it is a no-brainer.''
</P>
<P>
   For the selection committee, Abdur-Rahim was a no-brainer for
the team. At 6 feet 9, the silky-smooth former Wheeler High star
can play all three frontline positions, which was significant.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Thorn, chairman of USA Basketball Men's Senior National
Team, said: ``He is one of the bright young stars in our league. He
fits right in with the other players that we have, and we're very
interested in having players who can play multiple positions, we're
very interested in having very flexible players, and he fits right
in with that. He can play three or four.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He can exploit smaller players by posting up and can use his
quickness to beat bigger players with his driving ability,'' Thorn
said. ``We now have a versatile, well-rounded team, and we are at
least three deep at every position, which is very important and is
insurance against injury. . . .I'm very excited about Shareef's
skill and talent level, but I also feel he is a great fit for this
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdur-Rahim's accomplishments in the NBA 20.3 points, 10.1
rebounds last year have gone widely unnoticed because he plays in
relative obscurity in Vancouver. The worldwide attention of the
Olympics could take Abdur-Rahim's fame to another level. Right?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure,'' he said. ``I'm not even really that concerned
with that and haven't been throughout my career. This is really not
something that you can get caught up with yourself and what it can
do for me. I'm just looking forward to going in and fitting in with
the guys and doing the best that we can do with the country and try
and bring home the gold.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Abdur-Rahim looks forward to the position of being on a
team favored to win. ``Yeah, without a doubt,'' he said. ``It's
been a while, three or four years, since I've been part of
something that was expected to win and win big, so that will be
exciting. I think everything (that happens) will be something I'll
try to remember, and I'll just try and soak it all up.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the whole thing remains somewhat overwhelming for
Abdur-Rahim.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, I just keep saying it's an accomplishment. This is an
honor. Anytime you're honored for anything, it's flattering. I've
been on teams that aren't winning, and I guess a true All-Star is
one that is able to help his team win, and until our team gets to
that point, I kind of understand. I think this is much more of an
accomplishment than any All-Star selection could be.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's outstanding recognition for a franchise that exists
north of the border and has not reached the playoffs in its five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is big-time for our organization,'' Abdur-Rahim
said. ``We're an organization that doesn't get a lot of exposure,
and then, just for our fans, it gives our fans something to be
proud about and to cheer about. I think it is big time for us.''

A DEAD HEAT FOR BEST DRAMA EMMY?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use on or after Sept. 8, 2000, by NYTimes News Service
clients) 
 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News

<P>
   The Academy of Television Arts and Sciences feels your pain. It
knows you're sick and tired of the same actors winning the same
awards year after year _ why doesn't it save everyone the trouble
and just run repeats of previous years' ceremonies? And it
understands your grumblings that the tried-and-true, humdrum series
walk away with trophies intended for, as the categories themselves
state, ``outstanding,'' groundbreaking series.
</P>
<P>
   (Everybody's ripping off HBO's ``The Larry Sanders Show'' today,
but it won only two out of its whopping 50-something nominations.)
</P>
<P>
   So things, we have been informed, will be different this year.
First off, voting rules have changed. In the past, Emmy voters were
herded into cramped, filthy boxcars and railroaded off to luxury
hotels where they were locked into suites and forced to watch
television unrelentingly, until they came up with winners in some
873 separate categories and/or vowed privately to leave the
television business altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Which wasn't much of a sacrifice, since voters in the past have
usually been dismissed as folks who last worked when TVs were
called ``orthocon tubes'' and there was no such thing as cable, so
no one said a dirty word or disrobed.
</P>
<P>
   That's the popular explanation as to why HBO's ``The Sopranos,''
which everyone on the planet Earth but academy voting members
agreed was 1998-99's best series by a Jersey Turnpike mile, got
bupkis at last year's Emmys, a measly two trophies out of 16
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   This year, members of the academy considered edgy and
enlightened but too overemployed to sit in hotel rooms (to watch
TV, at least) were given videotapes of nominated series. So, at
their leisure, they either watched all or some portion of several
or many of the tapes, not fast-forwarding through the boring bits
!ital!on their honor, or at least knew enough to vote for the
coolest shows, even if they haven't seen them. Yes, this year, the
rules were changed so that ``The Sopranos'' could win and the
academy wouldn't look so staggeringly stupid and behind the times.
</P>
<P>
   Except that something happened along the way. Aaron Sorkin had
the visionary imagination to create, in NBC's ``The West Wing,'' an
upright, decent U.S. President untainted by scandal or politics as
usual who just wants to do what's right. And since there's no
science-fiction category in the Emmys, and since ``The West Wing''
shocked everyone by being a blue-ribbon network-TV series, there it
is, up for the Outstanding Drama trophy right alongside ``The
Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, anything that provides soaring uplift and smart, snappy
dialogue for the populace like ``The West Wing'' did week in, week
out is naturally going to be honored by any establishment with
``Academy'' in its name _ its network affiliation is just gravy.
There was, as well, a sense that a little spin fell off ``The
Sopranos''' fastball in Season 2 (true, but to a fairly negligible
degree). So unless those edgy sorts recruited by the academy feel
they have been charged solely to right last year's snub, look for
``The West Wing'' to win Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   That same rule change could affect the Outstanding Comedy
category, as well. Since everyone has pretty much gotten tired of
giving Emmys to ``Frasier,'' and since last year's winner, ``Ally
McBeal,'' was scarcely outstanding this year so is not nominated,
there would seem to be two other series duking it out for the big
award.
</P>
<P>
   CBS' ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' is a smart show draped in the
drab finery known as ``family sitcom,'' a show that audiences knew
was good long before the TV academy, which finally perked up last
year. The bad news for ``Raymond'' is that, as much as everybody
loves him, these new voters allegedly love the trendy stuff more,
and that's NBC's ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' a ground-breaking sitcom that's
so politically incorrect it's politically correct.
</P>
<P>
   So, whereas under the old rule, logic dictated that this would
be ``Raymond's'' year, the new rules suggest a tip to ``Will.'' In
fact, the battle is virtually geographical in TV-voter terms: It's
the Manhattan elite (``Will'') vs. the Long Island working class
(``Ray''). You know who wins that fight every time.
</P>
<P>
   There is one mitigating fact: ``Will'' is not nominated in the
writing category, while ``Raymond'' _ co-produced by HBO _ received
a key nod (for a priceless episode on PMS that'll go over big with
male voters, less so with women). But wait _ HBO's ``Sex and the
City'' received two. So maybe that's the hip Big Apple show that'll
win, but again, it's on cable and has those dirty words and naked
people that many voters may still be loathe to honor.
</P>
<P>
   And if that new band of edgy voters have their say, HBO's ``The
Corner's'' compelling smack addicts will caper away with the
Outstanding Miniseries Emmy, much to the chagrin of CBS' ``Jesus.''
But the academy works in strange and mysterious ways. Either way,
HBO's post-ceremony party will be the Hot Ticket, to glad-hand the
winners and/or grouse with the losers about the stinking academy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, prognosticating about who will win the acting categories is
playing a fool's game. Actors put up only a couple of performances
for consideration, so it's possible a couple of strong turns can
beat out a season's consistent good work (which can be the only
explanation for Kristin Johnston of ``3rd Rock From the Sun''
beating ``Raymond's'' Doris Roberts last year).
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, here are a few fool's guesses: Michael J. Fox will
receive a Lifetime Achievement Award in the guise of an Outstanding
Lead Actor in a Comedy Emmy for ``Spin City.'' James Gandolfini
will get the Emmy he should've won last year (which is not to say
that ``NYPD Blue's'' Dennis Franz doesn't deserve his warehouse of
Emmys) for ``The Sopranos.'' Jane Kaczmarek could ride the
``Malcolm in the Middle'' hype to a trophy for best comedy actress
(and could, in future years, become the John Lithgow in this
category). Julianna Margulies has plenty of baubles atop her mantel
but will likely get one last parting shot for her ``ER'' departure.
</P>
<P>
   Likely supporting performance winners:
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Nancy Marchand, not just because she's dead, but consider
fans' reaction to her death; now, try to imagine a similar reaction
to the loss of the characters played by the other nominees (though
Allison Janney's C.J. would be a sad loss for ``West Wing'').
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Dominick Chianese, because ``The Sopranos'' will grab any
award that doesn't fall off a truck.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Sean Hayes, because it'll be part of the ``Will &AMP; Grace''
statement (imagine him addressing Dr. Laura in his acceptance
speech!) and I think even David Hyde Pierce himself is tired of
winning.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Jennifer Aniston, because she's married to Brad Pitt, and
``Friends'' has generally been underrepresented at these
proceedings in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Here's my prediction most likely to come true: A month from now,
you won't remember most of the winners.
</P>
<P>
   And here are a few !ital!bonus observations about some Emmys
already awarded in a ghastly five-hour long ceremony a couple of
weeks back; not even winning one of these things is fair
compensation for sitting through that snoozefest:
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Outstanding evidence that the voters don't take their job
all that seriously: Cher's Vegas concert won an Emmy for its
costumes.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Outstanding proof that an Emmy and $4.75 will buy you a
cup of coffee: ``Freaks and Geeks'' won the Outstanding Casting
Emmy, but that didn't help it get renewed, now, did it?
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Outstanding confirmation that anything, really, can win an
Emmy: ``The 10th Kingdom,'' a miniseries even NBC executives
implicitly hated (and they were virtually its only audience, since
it stiffed), won for its title design.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Outstanding substantiation that there are wa-a-ay too many
Emmys: There's one for Outstanding Hairstyling for a Miniseries,
Movie or a Special. To differentiate from the hairstyling in a
comedy, a variety series, a drama or a non-fiction series.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Outstanding evidence that voters don't quite get the idea
of category definitions: A single program, ``American Masters:
Hitchcock, Selznick and the End of Hollywood,'' won the Outstanding
Non-fiction !ital!Series category, beating out Ric Burns'
monumental 12-hour documentary ``New York.''
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Outstanding indication that voters don't quite understand
the rules and/or simple math: ``Fail-Safe'' won for Outstanding
Technical Direction, Camerawork, Video for a Miniseries, Movie or a
Special (can they really engrave all that on such a tiny trophy?).
The rules state: ``To be eligible, a cameraperson must have
contributed at least 10 percent of !ital!on-air camera time. If a
cameraperson does not reach 10 percent, he/she is ineligible.''
Fifteen camera-people were named in the victory, which obviously
adds up to 150 percent of airtime.

EURO SUFFERS IN RETREAT TO DOLLARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The value of the battered euro plunged further against the
dollar Wednesday, as investors fled the recently minted currency of
a unified Europe to bet on a smooth-sailing US economy.
</P>
<P>
   The euro's decline, analysts said, was spurred by Wednesday's
report that US workers' productivity in the second quarter rose
even faster than estimated earlier. It was yet another sign of low
inflation and strong growth in the US economy, which has acted like
a giant vacuum, sucking in assets from around the globe and
boosting the dollar, at the expense of other currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the euro's decline, Patrick Smith, portfolio manager
for the Pioneer Europe and Pioneer World Equity funds in Boston,
said, ``It's more dollar strength going on out there than it is
euro weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   The euro, which has lost 30 percent of its value against the
dollar over the past year, sustained its biggest decline ever
Wednesday. It tumbled 2.3 percent, to a value of about 87 US cents.
A year ago, the euro was trading at about $1.05.
</P>
<P>
   European markets were down slightly Wednesday, though losses
were contained at under 1 percent of the three major index's value.
London's FTSE 100 index fell 57.8, to 6694.70, while on Germany's
stock market, the DAX declined 62.05, to 7333.02. France's bourse
saw a 59.97-point decline in its 40-stock index, to 6796.79.
</P>
<P>
   Such an exaggerated imbalance between the US dollar and the euro
may present an opportunity for investors with stamina to jump into
Europe, where economies are strengthening, even as its unified
currency softens, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Surging oil prices and inflation in Europe are dangers for
investors, though _ perhaps more so than in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The euro's skid this week began, traders said, after German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder was quoted on Monday as saying, ``I
don't want to be long,'' or own a lot of euros. But Schroeder also
noted that the euro's decline was welcomed by European exporters. A
weak euro makes their goods less expensive overseas.
</P>
<P>
   A strong US dollar is one of the spillover effects of raising
interest rates _ a policy pursued by the Federal Reserve since June
1999.
</P>
<P>
   US bonds have attracted overseas investors, too, rallying in
recent months on growing confidence that the economy is slowing and
that the Fed is nearly at the end of its cycle of rate increases.
The central bank raised its benchmark rate to a nine-year high of
6.5 percent in May, but has not changed rates since then.
</P>
<P>
   The productivity figures may also encourage investment in US
securities if it means the Fed has achieved its goal of a ``soft
landing'' for the economy, with low inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flows are going into the dollar,'' said Patrick Laub, chief
trader at Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen in Frankfurt, Germany. ``As
long as we have these capital flows, the euro will suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   The euro, a single regional currency introduced in stages in
Europe, has been battered almost nonstop since its January 1999
debut, losing 25 percent to date. After a brief run-up in May and
June, the currency slid again.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, European stock markets have had a respectable year,
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Henry, vice president of T. Rowe Price International in
Baltimore, noted that many markets in Europe, on a
domestic-currency basis, are actually outperforming US stock
markets. When US investors translate their euro-purchased stocks
into costly US dollars, however, the returns deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality for investors is dollar returns,'' Henry said.
</P>
<P>
   He and other money managers said they are optimistic about
Europe's future, though. Because the euro has fallen so much,
traders said, it has fallen below reasonable levels and will
inevitably snap back.
</P>
<P>
   A weak euro ``presents _ for those people with a little bit of
nerve and a little bit of vision to look out a few years _ an
excellent opportunity to shift assets out of dollars and into
euros,'' said Pioneer's Smith.
</P>
<P>
   And with Europe's economies improving, ``You're going to
eventually find Europe in the same sweet spot that the US is in
now,'' he said.

DISSENT WITHIN OPPOSITION MAY IMPERIL ITS CONTROL OF MAJOR SERBIAN
CITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ A split in the opposition to President
Slobodan Milosevic is putting at risk its main achievement so far:
its control over Serbia's major cities, including their radio and
television stations.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials are pressing opposition politicians to settle
their differences and present a united slate of candidates for the
local elections on Sept. 24, but so far without success. Otherwise,
they fear, Milosevic can regain lost ground and win back some
cities.
</P>
<P>
   This could happen even though the opposition is probably more
united and popular now than it has been since its victory in the
last local elections, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for president of Yugoslavia, Milosevic is trailing
the main opposition candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, in opinion
polls. The polls indicate that a large majority of Serbs want
change in the elections, which are for the federal presidency, the
federal Parliament and municipal governments.
</P>
<P>
   But a game of mutual blackmail over the presidential race is
blocking opposition unity on the local level, much to the confusion
of voters and to the distress of local government officials, who do
not share the rivalries of their national party bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Some senior opposition politicians, who expect Milosevic to try
to retain the presidency through vote fraud or other means, say one
of his main goals is to take back some cities before vital Serbian
elections, which are due next year. Serbia, long Milosevic's power
base, dominates Montenegro, the other republic remaining in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition control over major cities like Kragujevac, Kraljevo
and Uzice is at stake, with even Belgrade, the capital, at risk,
say both opposition officials and members of the governing
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Milosevic called these elections more to win back some
cities than for any other reason,'' said Goran Svilanovic, leader
of the Civil Alliance, part of the united opposition backing
Kostunica. ``This is the real fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Svilanovic said the opposition must be realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how many people want to wake up one day and find
Milosevic gone, but it's a step-by-step fight,'' he said. ``We need
to take pieces of his power and enlarge the number of cities we
control. And if we lose some of these cities, these parties may not
exist in a year, when we're facing Serbian elections.''
</P>
<P>
   A united opposition could win cities currently controlled by the
government, like Valjevo and Leskovac, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Milan Milosevic, a political analyst with the magazine Vreme
(and no relation to the president), said that Milosevic's coalition
will win the federal elections because of a boycott by Montenegro,
and that his coalition badly wants victories in the local races.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Milosevic solves one problem at a time, the one in
front of him,'' the commentator said. ``These elections will start
the real game, which will go on for the next year. He's a fighter,
and he'll continue to fight.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Milosevic has ruled by dividing the opposition. After his losses
in 1996, he won Serbian elections handily in 1997 when one part of
the opposition, led by Zoran Djindjic of the Democratic Party,
boycotted the election. Another part, led by Djindjic's archrival
Vuk Draskovic of the Serbian Renewal Movement, did not boycott the
vote. Regardless of the national rivalry, the two groups continue
to cooperate in many city governments.
</P>
<P>
   The mercurial Draskovic, who lives in Montenegro, is keeping
aloof from the rest of the opposition, which has banded together to
support Kostunica. By doing so, Draskovic seems to be harming his
own party, which had been the largest and best organized opposition
group.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic insisted on running his own candidate for the
presidency _ Vojislav Mihailovic, the mayor of Belgrade _ and on
running his own candidates for the federal Parliament. While he is
facing great pressure from his party to unite with the rest of the
opposition on the local level, it is Kostunica, backed by Djindjic,
who is playing hardball.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic now wants joint slates on the local level. But
Kostunica and Djindjic insist that Draskovic and his party first
withdraw Mihailovic, who has no chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts and U.S. officials say that Kostunica and
especially Djindjic also see this as a chance to finish off the
difficult Draskovic as a serious opposition leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old personal rivalries and suspicions between Djindjic and
Draskovic are a factor,'' one official said. ``Djindjic smells
Draskovic's blood in the water.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, both Kostunica and Djindjic deny any such
motivation, saying it is Draskovic who is hurting the opposition by
remaining aloof and running Mihailovic as a spoiler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Milosevic is happy that Mihailovic is running, and this
makes me careful,'' Djindjic said. ``On the presidential level, we
need a black-and-white race to win a million more votes than
Milosevic. We can't afford to be confused on the local level and be
attacked by our coalition partners.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty stems from changes in the local elections made
last year by Milosevic's government _ to a winner-take-all system,
eliminating a second-round runoff between the two top finishers. So
a divided opposition could be beaten by a determined member of the
ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Under such a system, Milosevic would have done well in the 1996
local elections, rather than losing them in the second round. Even
so, it took months of daily demonstrations and marches for him to
acknowledge his defeat in those local elections.
</P>
<P>
   But now, after the NATO bombing last year and the increased
repression of dissent, it is not clear that Serbs have the energy
or optimism to demonstrate again or to confront the regime openly,
even if the voting seems to be manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica and Djindjic say there is no chance now for a united
opposition slate on the local level, but U.S. officials continue to
push, as do Draskovic's aides, pressed by local officials. One of
their main arguments is that even if Mihailovic stays in the
presidential race, he will not win enough votes to make much of a
difference in the results, since many members of Draskovic's party
will vote for Kostunica anyway.

U.S. REPORTEDLY GAVE RUSSIA INFORMATION ON SUB THAT SANK 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's national security adviser,
Samuel Berger, has provided his Russian counterpart with a written
summary of what U.S. naval and intelligence officials believe
caused the nuclear-powered submarine Kursk to sink last month in
the Barents Sea, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The summary, based on acoustic recordings and other information
gathered by two U.S. submarines and a surface vessel in the Barents
at the time, included evidence that U.S. officials have said
contradicts assertions by some Russian officials that the Kursk
sank after a collision with another submarine or a World War II-era
mine.
</P>
<P>
   Berger provided the information, at the Russians' request, in a
meeting on Monday with Sergei Ivanov, head of the Russian Security
Council and a close aide to President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   The information could help Putin's government sort out which of
several accounts was the most likely explanation for the sinking on
Aug. 12 that killed all 118 crew members.
</P>
<P>
   ``In response to a request from the Russian government, Mr.
Berger provided some information to Mr. Ivanov on our knowledge
regarding the tragedy,'' said P.J. Crowley, a spokesman for the
National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton opened his meeting with Putin on Wednesday in New York
with a discussion of the Kursk's sinking. The presidents were at
the world leaders' meeting at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton expressed his regret and his sympathies to
the families, of course,'' said Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott afterward. ``And President Putin talked a bit about the
episode itself and what it revealed and how he had coped with it.
There was some further discussion on that.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to share information on the Kursk was unusual,
given the fact that it was gathered by one of the most secretive
parts of the U.S. military, the submarine fleet. Crowley declined
to discuss what information was shared, except to say that it was
in an unclassified form.
</P>
<P>
   But Itar-Tass, the Russian news agency, quoted Ivanov as saying
the information included technical details on ``the exact times, to
the second, of two explosions'' that wracked the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have said the explosions _ recorded by the
Memphis, another U.S. submarine reported to be the Toledo and a
surveillance ship, the Loyal _ strongly suggest that the Kursk sank
after a catastrophic accident in its hull and not because of a
collision.
</P>
<P>
   Following that theory, a rocket-propelled torpedo being loaded
or launched as part of an exercise misfired, with its engine or its
fuel exploding. Two minutes and 15 seconds later, a larger
explosion of the torpedo warhead tore a gaping hole in the sub's
bow.

CIRCUITS QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Is there any difference between a DSL line and a cable-modem
connection for high-speed Internet access?
</P>
<P>
   A. The two types of connections have several things in common,
like speeds much faster than a regular dial-up modem can offer and
the ability to be on all the time. And they usually download files
much faster than they upload them. But a cable connection and an
asynchronous digital subscriber line (commonly referred to as DSL)
differ in how they link you to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A cable-modem setup uses the same type of wire that brings cable
television programming into your house. In general, cable
downloading speeds average 1 million bits per second, about 20
times as fast as a 56 kilobits-per-second modem (and can be even
faster). Cable is a shared line, though, and one reason the speeds
may vary is that when a lot of people are using that cable
connection, downloading speeds drop for everyone. One place to find
more information on cable modems is the Cable Modem Information
Network (www.cable-modem.net).
</P>
<P>
   A DSL connection is made through a phone line instead of a
shared cable, so speeds are more consistent. Some places advertise
a maximum of 1.54 megabits for downloading speed, but most
lower-priced DSL services for the home user offer downloading
speeds of 256 to 640 kilobits per second, or up to 11 times as fast
as a 56K modem. DSL technology can maximize the potential of your
phone line for transmitting data because it is possible to use the
same line for phone calls and DSL service. For more information
about DSL, visit www.adsl.com. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The response time from when I type a letter and when it
appears on the screen seems very slow on my new computer. Is there
anything I can do to fix that?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Check the cord connecting your keyboard to the computer and
make sure that everything is plugged in tightly. (If you have a
cordless keyboard, make sure that you are not farther away than the
manufacturer recommends.) Slow response time is often caused by
insufficient RAM or processor speed for the task at hand. A program
that you may have open in the background but are not using may be
taking up some of your processor's attention and causing the lag
you see between keys and screen. You might try closing all programs
except the one you are working in and see if the keyboard response
time improves.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases when a computer's memory and processor resources
are low, USB keyboards have been known to cause small delays in the
keyboard response time. Increasing your system resources by closing
programs might help in this situation as well.
</P>
<P>
   A full hard drive or temporary-file directory can also slow
things down, but if the computer is new, you may want to check with
the manufacturer's technical support department, especially if the
machine is still under warranty or you have free access to the
telephone help line.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have already used up all the USB ports on my computer, but
I want to add a USB scanner. Is there an easy way to do this?
</P>
<P>
   A. If you have used up your USB ports, you can purchase a hub
that lets you add more. It is a small device that plugs into one of
your computer's USB ports and offers you multiple slots to plug in
other USB peripherals.
</P>
<P>
   You can get hubs with three, four, seven or even more ports. You
can also link the hubs together to create more outlets for USB
equipment. Hubs are available in ``powered'' and ``nonpowered''
models. The powered hubs have their own electrical supply and
typically offer better performance because the hubs do not have to
rely solely on the power that runs through the USB cables, as the
nonpowered hubs do.

 &HT;    New politics of surplus are tricky territory
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before they begin falling to the winds of autumn, let's pause
for a moment to admire the majestic march of zeros that heralds the
onset of the fall presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   This week, while Al Gore, the Democrat, was laying out his
blueprint for what to do with a projected $4.6 trillion surplus,
George W. Bush, the Republican, was explaining his $198 billion
plan to add prescription drug coverage and other improvements to
Medicare. So many million-, billion- and trillion-dollar proposals
are being floated this fall, it's hard for the candidates, much
less the voters, to keep track of all the zeros going by.
</P>
<P>
   This remains a happy economy, when neither party is tempted to
preach hard times. It is also tricky ground for Bush, at least in
this phase of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``My party has often pointed out the limits and flaws of the
Great Society,'' Bush said Tuesday. ``But there were successes as
well, and Medicare is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely there are many Republican beneficiaries of
Medicare who would argue much with Bush's remark, but it
underscores the delicate task Bush must execute in reaching beyond
his conservative, anti-spending base to compete with Gore for a
broader spectrum of middle-class voters.
</P>
<P>
   There are significant differences in the two candidates'
proposals. Gore's prescription drug plan would cost $253 billion
compared to Bush's $158 billion, over 10 years. Bush's proposal
would rely more on free-market options. In some cases, the
Republican proposal is more generous to lower-income recipients
than Gore's plan, although the Democrats charge he can't pay for it
and deliver a major tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   But the politics of surplus are such that the differences
generally get expressed as a matter of degree. Spending has been
stamped on the public consciousness, with the energetic assistance
of the Republicans, as an essentially Democratic exercise. That
doesn't invalidate Bush's more modest proposals, but it makes it
easier for the Democrats to raise doubts about the Republican's
real commitment to spending the money Bush talks about.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties of playing in this particular territory made
the media distractions of the week doubly unfortunate for the Bush
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   When Bill Clinton got caught on mike, it usually smacked of an
elaborate setup. Bush's unguarded remark to running mate Dick
Cheney this week revealed no such guile.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's supporters will embrace this as a token of their
candidate's much-advertised genuineness, but it is the precise
difference between the two politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign moved aggressively on the other distraction,
putting up an ad claiming Gore is backing down from his commitment
to appear on two TV interview show debates. Gore has said he would
appear on these debates if Bush agrees to three formal debates run
by the bipartisan Presidential Commission on Debates, while Bush
wants only one commission debate.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving aside the hair-splitting, it's hard to see what
advantage Bush gains by protracting this argument. There is a
reasonable argument that Bush ought to sign on to as many debates
as possible, decreasing the impact of any gaffe and deflating
Gore's claim he's trying to duck him.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, it's to Bush's advantage to settle the debate
question as quickly as possible, and maneuver his message back into
familiar territory.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Gore unveils detailed long-range economic plan
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By BENNETT ROTH
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Hoping to dazzle voters with 191 pages of budget
figures and analysis, Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore
Wednesday unveiled a long-range economic plan that he pledged would
eliminate the national debt, reduce poverty, increase family
savings and add jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In an address at Cleveland State University, Gore outlined a
comprehensive 10-year plan for use of the projected budget surplus
that contained little that is new, but compiled and repackaged many
of the ideas he has rolled out during the course of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing this because I don't want you to have to read the
tea leaves, or read between the lines of a press release or
position paper to know what the Gore-Lieberman administration would
mean for families,'' said Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And in a play on George W. Bush's father's broken pledge of
``read my lips _ no new taxes','' Gore told a supportive audience,
``Instead you can just read my plan _ a detailed economic plan that
spells out line by line, how we can make prosperity work for
America's families.''
</P>
<P>
   In conjunction with the address, the candidate released a
191-page glossy paperback filled with numbers, graphs and a listing
of 10 economic goals for a Gore administration that mixes
conservative fiscal policy with populist programs.
</P>
<P>
   The goals include eliminating the debt by 2012, raising family
income by one third and cutting the earning gap between men and
women by half, bringing down the poverty rate by 10 percent, and
creating 10 million high-tech jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The document, titled ``Prosperity for America's Families,'' was
reminiscent of Bill Clinton's ``Putting People First'' _ a catalog
of initiatives published during the president's 1992 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore book also served to underscore a message the candidate
has pushed since the Democratic National Convention _ that he puts
forth detailed proposals while Bush offers slogans and
generalities. The Gore campaign posted the blueprint on his Web
site, www.algore.com.
</P>
<P>
   Bush struck back, telling about 1,000 supporters at a campaign
rally in Indianapolis that he could summarize Gore's plan: ``It
says keep sending all of your money to Washington, and I'll be glad
to spend it for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett dubbed Gore's book a ``200-page
press release'' and said it included spending that would bust the
federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   But in his address, Gore suggested that his plan was more
fiscally responsible than Bush's, arguing that the governor would
be unable to pay down the debt because of the high cost of his $1.3
trillion tax cut proposal, coupled with a range of new spending.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested his opponent was relying on the same faulty
economic assumptions that guided the Reagan and Bush
administrations during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``My plan wasn't built on the cross-your-fingers economics that
says we can give more to the people who have the most _ and then
just hope the benefits trickle down to the middle class,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in one concession to his Republican opponent, Gore embraced
the projections by the Congressional Budget Office, which has
estimated that the budget surplus during the next 10 years would be
$300 million larger than the Clinton administration has calculated.
Gore had earlier criticized the Texas governor for relying on
overly rosy budget projections.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore said he would not use extra surplus money as Bush has
proposed to give out bigger tax cuts and pay the transition costs
of letting people invest a portion of their Social Security taxes
in the private market.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Democratic contender said he would deposit the
extra $300 million in a reserve fund to be used for emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our national government should do what so many families have
done for years _ set aside some money for a rainy day to be
absolutely certain that we never spend money we don't have,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to his budget document, Gore would divvy up the $4.5
billion in projected surplus in this way:
</P>
<P>
   Slightly more than $1.5 billion would be allotted to a variety
of new spending programs and a $500 billion tax cut. The remaining
$3 billion would be used to pay down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has conceded that his plan would not eliminate
the debt until 2016 in part because of the high cost of phasing in
the Bush Social Security plan.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's economic blueprint immediately drew fire from Bush
and other Republicans who claimed that the Democrat was
underestimating the costs of his programs and exaggerating the
impact of the governor's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore's spending program and `rainy day' fund overspend the
surplus by $906 billion, leaving Social Security and Medicare high
and dry,'' said Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Bush campaign took out a half-page USA Today
ad, which touted the endorsement of the governor's proposals by a
list of academics, business people and others who worked at
conservative think tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Republican majority on the Senate Budget
Committee issued an analysis of the Gore's budget plan that claimed
that his programs would exceed the projected surplus by $27 billion
to $900 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides countered that the Republicans had dramatically
overestimated the price tag of a number of Gore programs, including
a tax credit to encourage people to save for retirement and a
college tuition tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   To help sell his economic plan, Gore brought along Robert Rubin,
a former Clinton administration Treasury secretary and Wall Street
executive. In his introductory remarks, Rubin called Gore's
blueprint, ``the most detailed economic plan offered by any
presidential candidate in my memory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice President Gore was the center of all major economic
decisions of this administration,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   In a jab at Bush's plan, Rubin said, ``Fiscal discipline is not
easy. Tax cuts are a lot easier.''

NEW GRAPHICS CARD TECHNOLOGY TRANSFORMS PC GAMING TO CINEMATIC
EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL MARRIOTT  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until recently, the only home computer users who cared about
seeing high-quality images on their monitors were hard-core gamers.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few years, that circle has expanded to include
people who watch DVD movies on their computers or edit digital
photographs or videos on the weekends. And yes, some of them may
even be tempted to play the occasional game of Quake III.
</P>
<P>
   All that focuses more attention on a generally overlooked
computer component: the graphics card.
</P>
<P>
   For years, home and office computers worked quite nicely without
graphics cards. The electronic components that helped the computer
render routine, two-dimensional images were built into the main
circuit board. But as the demand for more powerful computer
graphics increased (first brought on by the heavy graphics demands
of the early Windows operating system), the circuitry designed to
produce graphics, especially 3-D images, evolved into powerful,
separate circuit boards that plug into computers' motherboards.
</P>
<P>
   Those boards _ also called video boards, graphics accelerator
cards and game boards _ are a collection of components for
processing graphics quickly, a process known as acceleration. Each
graphics card has its own microprocessor and packs megabytes of its
own memory, arranged on a board the size of a graham cracker.
</P>
<P>
   Practically overnight a confusing crop of graphics cards has
sprung up, each promising great enhancements for what can actually
be seen on computer monitors.
</P>
<P>
   For home computer users with gaming aspirations, almost any card
that comes with 64 megabytes of memory and can handle OpenGL,
DirectX and Glide _ all video game standards _ will fit the bill.
For the average consumer who just wants to play a few modest
computer games, a low-end graphics card with 2 MB to 8 MB of memory
will work fine. Even the built-in graphics cards, the kind likely
to be found in a budget computer, are adequate.
</P>
<P>
   Graphics cards come in two types: PCI (Peripheral Component
Interconnect) and AGP (Accelerated or Advanced Graphics Port).
These abbreviations refer to the expansion slot the cards occupy on
computer motherboards. The AGP slot, found on almost all computers
made in the last several years, is better suited for a graphics
card.
</P>
<P>
   I looked at three highly rated, high-performance graphics cards,
each made to work in an AGP slot and all for PCs: the Voodoo5 5500
AGP by 3dfx, the Radeon 64-MB DDR by ATI and the 3D Prophet II GTS
64 MB by Hercules, a division of Guillemot. Each card has 64
megabytes of memory, important for delivering high resolutions for
larger monitors (19 inch and up). Each is supposed to deliver high
levels of color and 3-D acceleration, a must for demanding games.
</P>
<P>
   Each card was a marvel of engineering. But the Voodoo5 5500 was,
pound for pound, the, uh, heaviest. The board, with its outsize
length (just over 9.5 inches) and two on-board cooling fans, has
macho appeal. And get this: the card needs so much juice that it
plugs into the computer's main power supply. Most cards draw all
the electricity they need from the slot that connects them to the
motherboard.
</P>
<P>
   Once it was snapped into place and its software installed
(itself a snap), the Voodoo5 came to life and instantly produced
noticeable improvements on my 19-inch display. Taking advantage of
this card's 2-D accelerator, DVD movies appeared to have more
depth, color, detail and vibrancy. But it was under game conditions
where the Voodoo5 5500 showed its true colors. Revving up its 3-D
accelerator capabilities, the Voodoo5 called upon its processing
muscle to render game environments, equipment and characters
smoothly and rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   The company that makes the Voodoo5 says that its technology is
capable of drawing 667 megapixels every second. (The faster the
pixels are drawn, the better the image resolution.) The card, which
costs $299, also did a good job of reducing the number of jagged
edges you often see when running computer games with inadequate
graphics cards.
</P>
<P>
   But after several days of use, I noticed that the Voodoo5 raised
the temperature of my motherboard, sometimes making it so hot that
I had to shut my computer down for a few minutes. Especially good
computer case ventilation is a must for this monster card.
</P>
<P>
   The Radeon, which costs $399, was also simple to install and
began working right away. It was particularly impressive handling
DVD movies and images, eliminating the need for a separate MPEG-2
decoder card, which many DVD-ROM makers require or include. With
the Radeon alone, DVD movies could be played full-screen with good
color depth and resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The Radeon also played 3-D computer games well, with resolutions
as high as 2,048 by 1,536 pixels, the same as the Voodoo5. But the
Radeon's images were not as clean as those rendered by the Voodoo5.
It draws only 366 megapixels per second but compensates in other
ways.
</P>
<P>
   The Radeon does offer some handy pluses: a TV Out port for
sending computer-generated images over included cables to a
television set (preferably one with a large screen) and
video-capture capability to store images seen on television.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the third card, the 3-D Prophet II, which was the
hands-down winner in practically all the categories and in a few
that only it offered.
</P>
<P>
   For all of its optimized processing might and 64 MB of on-board
memory, the Prophet II is surprisingly unassuming in size. It fits
easily into its AGP slot, but installation was a bit of a task,
requiring the complete removal of any software from previous
graphics cards (at least a three-step process).
</P>
<P>
   Once it was in and its software was installed, the Prophet
started showing off. Its makers say the card will deliver 800
megapixels a second.
</P>
<P>
   The Prophet easily handles very high 2-D and 3-D resolutions, up
to 2,048 by 1,536 pixels. DVD movies looked especially clear and
detailed when played through this card. The Prophet also has a TV
Out port and something the other cards don't: a DVI _ Digital
Visual Interface &UR;  &LR; _ enabling newer digital monitors to be plugged
right into this card. The Voodoo5 and Radeon are not set up to
handle digital monitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Prophet easily handled the most demanding video games,
making Quake III look downright cinematic. Textures, lighting and
shading were all superior, and the card's rendering of 3-D
environments was at least as clean as Voodoo5's.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a downside to the Prophet _ its price. At $420,
this card is one of the most expensive consumer cards on the
market. That cost might be especially hard to justify if you are
not concerned about seeing your computer games played on a digital
flat-screen monitor or if you're not interested in using an LCD
projector to stun colleagues with the most visually dazzling
PowerPoint presentation they are likely to see. For less money, the
Voodoo5 is a better buy.
</P>
<P>
   If you are not a serious gamer and do not mind good VCR-type
quality images on your computer's DVD, stick with your old
eight-megabyte graphics card, which probably came with the wonder
PC you bought a few years ago.

<P>
   ANN ARBOR, Mich. _ I'm glad to see that in the face of John
McEnroe's petulant insistence that not only he but ``any good male
college player'' could beat them, Venus and Serena Williams have
responded with both dignity and humor. Laughter is an especially
appropriate answer to McEnroe's childish display of wounded egoism,
but there are serious issues here, too.
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing seems all too familiar. In 1973, I found myself
denigrated, along with three Soviet athletes, the track star
Lyudmila Bragina and the Press sisters, in the maunderings of
George Gilder in his book ``Sexual Suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mss. Bragina and Kraker and the Press sisters enter the
athletic realm on male terms,'' he wrote. ``While often performing
impressive feats _ for women _ and sometimes defeating a few lesser
male competitors, they cannot fulfill the Olympian ideal of sport.
In fact, when intruding on the male athletic arena, women may serve
only to detract from its symbolic and ritual content and thus its
value in male socialization.'' I read the chapter in a bookstore
and laughed, astounded at such nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the distance runner Steve Prefontaine scoffed
at the world record set in the women's indoor mile by Francie
Larrieu, saying, ``I can run six 4:29 miles in a row.'' Soon
afterward, I wrote in The New York Times that comparisons of the
relative performances of men and women are pointless. Now I find
myself making the same obvious point again.
</P>
<P>
   Billie Jean King has been quoted as saying that a new version of
her 1973 match with Bobby Riggs, with McEnroe playing against one
of the Williamses, would be ``great.'' Much as I admire King, she
is wrong. It was not great to pit women against men 25 years ago,
when girls and women were battling to take the first steps toward
equal opportunity in sports, and it would not be great now, when we
still have far to go.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics revealed under federal law show a clear remaining
gap. Most large intercollegiate athletic programs are still not in
compliance with Title IX, the civil rights law requiring parallel
athletic opportunities for women and men in educational
institutions that accept federal aid. And when a school drops a
men's sport as a means of equalizing sports offerings, blame is
often assigned to the law and to women, rather than to the
administrators who take this cheap and damaging way out.
</P>
<P>
   We all know that in most sports, competing against men would not
give women equal opportunity. Even in events like the New York City
Marathon, where thousands of men and women run together, they have
separate championships. And no matter what rivalries between the
genders unfold on the city's streets during those hours, women and
men undoubtedly care more at the end of the day about how well they
did against their own sex, because it is the most valid comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, does John McEnroe feel compelled to denigrate women's
performances, apparently somehow resenting that women were given
credit and admired?
</P>
<P>
   I am glad the Williams sisters have indicated no interest in
being drawn into some trumped-up, media-hyped new battle of the
sexes. By dismissing the idea, they do what is right for themselves
and for other girls and women. Why let the threatened male ego
create a circus and intrude yet again on our own competition?
</P>
<P>
   (Francie Kraker Goodridge, a track and field coach, was on the
U.S. Olympics track teams in 1968 and 1972.)

<P>
   CHICAGO _ The health care debate has heated up in earnest with
George W. Bush's detailed proposal to overhaul Medicare. On this
issue, Bush seeks to meld the best of the open market with what he
terms the nation's ``moral obligation'' to secure the health needs
of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   His plan rejects Al Gore's flawed strategy of shoring up the
existing Medicare system and expanding it to include prescription
drugs. In its stead, Bush hopes that private insurers would compete
to supply senior citizens with an expansive package of medical
benefits for a fee underwritten in part by the federal government.
But the elderly could also stick with the basic Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this plan won't induce many insurers to offer
expanded health care packages. Bush may lure customers; but he
won't attract any insurer that speaks to its actuaries first.
Offering individuals insurance options may work in settings where
they do not already know their medical condition. But this approach
can't work for populations that have intimate knowledge of their
own health profiles.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose the government offers to pay a private health plan
$5,000 toward coverage of any enrollee that signs up for its
souped-up health plan. Older seniors with chronic illnesses, for
example, will surely flock to the plan, even with a required
copayment; but healthier and younger seniors are much more likely
to stick with Medicare, because they won't want to pay for the
extra coverage. What insurance carrier will cover high-risk
patients for premiums calibrated to some group average by the
federal government? Bush's proposal will not wean the elderly from
government programs. It will only reaffirm the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposal, on the other hand, could easily make things
worse. He seeks to tap into the common sentiment that health care
is a special good that markets cannot be trusted to properly
supply. But the gloomy economist reminds us that two constraints
still apply.
</P>
<P>
   First, any system of uniform prices shelters companies that can
only supply health care services at high cost.
</P>
<P>
   Second, increased health care subsidies lead to increased health
care consumption _ to be paid for by someone else, with no ceiling
to limit costs. This pattern of consumption goes a long way to
explaining the looming Medicare deficits.
</P>
<P>
   The seeds for Medicare's long-term woes were sown by its very
passage in 1965. The program subsidizes the elderly as a class at
the expense of the general taxpayer. And it imposes little
financial burden on recipients when they receive medical services.
To slow down consumer demand while keeping prices under control,
Medicare has instead adopted countless strategems, including
monitoring hospitals and doctors, imposing delays on services and
raising taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's program will do nothing to relieve these pressures. Far
from it, his prescription drug plan (more generous and hence more
flawed than Bush's) will surely increase the overall cost of
running Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to think of a sensible way out of this hole. It is
intolerable to force millions of people to pay for medical benefits
that they long thought they enjoyed as a right.
</P>
<P>
   But at the very least, both parties should stop serving up
endless plates of goodies. Instead, before the next economic
downturn hits, the next president should forthrightly work to trim
coverage and increase the out-of-pocket amount people contribute in
Medicare copayments. Both political parties should try to reduce
the costs of getting new drugs to market. Either we sober up today,
or we reap the whirlwind tomorrow, no matter who wins the next
election.

Chicago, is author of ``Mortal Peril: Our Inalienable Right to

STRONG EVIDENCE OF CANNIBALISM BY PREHISTORIC INDIANS IS REPORTED

<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have found what they say is the first direct evidence
of cannibalism among prehistoric Indians in the American Southwest,
belying the image of these people as steadfastly peaceful farmers
and perhaps reigniting a smoldering controversy over whether
ancestral Indians ever made it a practice to eat human flesh.
</P>
<P>
   At the site of an ancient Anasazi settlement near Mesa Verde in
southwestern Colorado, archaeologists came upon butchered human
bones and stone cutting tools stained with human blood. A ceramic
cooking pot held residues of human tissues. But the most telling
evidence was found in human feces: biochemical tests revealed clear
traces of digested human muscle protein in the dried coprolite, or
preserved prehistoric feces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Analysis of the coprolite and associated remains at last
provides definitive evidence for sporadic cannibalism in the
Southwest,'' Dr. Brian R. Billman, an archaeologist at the
University of North Carolina, said Wednesday in an announcement of
the discovery.
</P>
<P>
   The biochemist who conducted the tests, Dr. Richard A. Marlar of
the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver, said the
only way this particular human protein, myoglobin, would be present
in the feces was if the person had eaten human flesh. The tests and
other research were repeated many times over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we had to be absolutely sure on such a sensitive and
controversial issue,'' Marlar said in an interview. ``I have no
doubt about this data.''
</P>
<P>
   The research team described and interpreted the findings in a
report being published in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature.
In an accompanying commentary, Dr. Jared M. Diamond, an
anthropologist at the University of California at Los Angeles,
called the research ``compelling evidence'' of the practice of
cannibalism by some ancestral Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donald Grayson, an anthropologist at the University of
Washington who specializes in prehistoric people in the American
West, said in an interview that he was not surprised by the
findings. ``I was already convinced by the evidence of butchering
marks and bones from archaeological sites,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists think that cannibalism among people in the
American Southwest occurred between the years 900 and 1150, but was
fairly rare. Then, for about 50 years, during a severe drought, the
evidence suggests that there was an outbreak of cannibalism.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Diamond described this ``customary cannibalism'' as the
consumption of human flesh, from either deceased relatives or slain
enemies, as a non-emergency practice and not just something a group
may resort to in the face of starvation, as the Donner Party of
American pioneers did in 1846.
</P>
<P>
   The mounting evidence was described by Dr. Christy Turner II, an
anthropologist at Arizona State University in Tempe, in his book,
``Man Corn: Cannibalism and Violence in the Prehistoric American
Southwest,'' published last year by the University of Utah Press.
Turner is on an expedition to Siberia and could not be reached for
comment on the new findings.
</P>
<P>
   But the evidence is still disputed by some anthropologists and
especially by modern American Indians, offended at the perceived
insults to their ancestors. Archaeologists who reported suspected
cannibalism said they were sometimes accused of contributing to
racism and genocide. Some early European colonists used stories of
Indian cannibalism as justification for their conquests of the
land.
</P>
<P>
   The debate intensified after Dr. William Arens, an
anthropologist at the State University of New York at Stony Brook,
argued in an influential book, ``The Man-Eating Myth,'' that there
have been no reliable, firsthand accounts of cannibalism. So he
doubted the very existence of the practice, except perhaps when
people are facing death by starvation.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Arens for comment were unsuccessful. But in a
1998 article in The New Yorker magazine, he was quoted as having
apparently changed his mind. Asked about Turner's research, Arens
said that cannibalism is a ``possible interpretation, even a good
intepretation.''
</P>
<P>
   All previous evidence of occasional Indian cannibalism, though
increasingly persuasive, was still circumstantial. Finding the
human feces in an abandoned kiva, or pit house, in Colorado opened
the way to gathering direct evidence.
</P>
<P>
   When archaeological sites in the foothills of Sleeping Ute
Mountain were about to be destroyed by newly irrigated agricultural
fields, the Ute tribe called in Soil Systems Inc., a private
archaeological excavation company in Phoenix. Dr. Billman, who
worked for the company then, led the investigation of a community
of 70 to 125 people that existed there between the years 1130 and
1150.
</P>
<P>
   It was a time of severe drought, one of the worst the American
West in the last 2,000 years. The Anasazis' descendants are today's
Indian tribes such as the Hopi and Zuni, who have never practiced
cannibalism and object to archaeologists' inferences of cannibalism
by their prehistoric ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   Many Anasazi settlements, including Chaco Canyon in New Mexico,
failed and were abandoned in the drought. Billman said the small
Colorado site he studied was abandoned suddenly. No one had time to
remove tools, grinding stones and other valuable materials. The
piles of human bones showed that at least 35 adults and children
were butchered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the entire community was extinguished in a single
episode of violence and terroristic cannibalism during a period of
social chaos brought on by the drought,'' Billman said.
</P>
<P>
   The raiders may have considered the people intruders on their
own withered farming land and had to be driven away. After killing,
cooking and eating seven people in one dwelling, one of the raiders
squatted over the cold ashes of the hearth and defecated, a parting
sign of contempt.
</P>
<P>
   When Billman told this story at an archaeological meeting,
Marlar, an amateur archaeologist as well as biochemist, offered to
try to develop a technique for testing the feces for any traces of
human tissues. Biochemical assay techniques have been used before
to identify animal meat residues in cooking pots at archaeological
sites. Tests of the coprolite showed that the person had eaten
almost nothing but meat in the last 18 hours or so. And the
presence of the human myoglobin, the journal Nature said, was
``incontrovertible evidence of cannibalism.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Nature report, Markar, Billman and their colleagues
concluded, ``With the presentation of the first direct evidence of
cannibalism in the American Southwest in the prehistoric era, we
hope that the debate will shift from the question of whether or not
cannibalism occurred to questions concerning the social context,
causes and consequences of these events.''

BUSH SAYS GORE'S PROMISES WOULD WIPE OUT THE SURPLUS

<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. _ Gov. George W. Bush opened a new line of
attack against his Democratic rival Wednesday, accusing Vice
President Al Gore of making so many promises in this campaign that
he would eat through the entire $4.6 trillion federal surplus
projected for the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Bush chose the economy and fiscal policy as his targets on the
same day that Gore unveiled an ambitious and detailed economic
blueprint that called for the creation of a $300 billion rainy day
fund to be set aside for emergencies, like if the economy slows
down.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign took out a full page advertisement in USA
Today quoting six Nobel laureates and nearly 300 other economists
praising Bush's approach to fiscal policy. The Texas governor also
seized on an analysis released by Republicans on the Senate Budget
Committee, who said the vice president's programs could cost more
than $900 billion more than he has estimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want America to add up all the promises my opponent has
made,'' Bush told a crowd at an airport rally in Scranton, Pa.,
early Wednesday morning. ``All the promises over the course of this
campaign. He has the easy style of campaigning. Go to one community
and make a promise here, go to another community. When you add it
all up he's spent the entire surplus on bigger government. He won't
admit it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor stood before a large blowup poster of the USA
Today ad and used it to contrast his economic plan with Gore's.
``My plan has been endorsed by these Nobel prize winners and
leading economists,'' Bush said. ``His plan has been endorsed by
Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's charges were a mirror image of the Gore campaign's
assertions that it is the Republican nominee who is threatening the
surplus with his spending programs and his proposal to enact a $1.3
trillion tax cut over 10 years. When Bush unveiled a $198 billion
plan on Tuesday to change the Medicare system, Gore said, ``There
is no money to pay for it if you give away all of the surplus in
the form of a giant tax cut for the wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   At every campaign rally, Bush is now featuring blue-collar
families who he says would receive large reductions under his tax
cut plan, but who would receive little to nothing from Gore's
proposals for smaller, more targeted tax cuts for such expenses as
college education or home health care. ``We trust you with your
money,'' Bush told crowds Wednesday as he promoted his tax cut in
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Indiana. ``We trust you to make
decisions with your lives. We don't trust bureaucrats in
Washington, D.C. We don't believe in planners and deciders making
decisions on behalf of America.''
</P>
<P>
   At another airport rally here he appropriated Gore's theme of
helping ``working families'' and thundered, ``Guess which plan is
on the side of the working people? It's our plan. It's our plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's turn to economic themes Wednesday was echoed by his
running mate, Dick Cheney, who, campaigning before a chamber of
commerce in Wilmington, Del., said that he believed the economic
policies of President Reagan should get a strong measure of credit
for the booming economy of the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Answering a question from a member of the audience, Cheney
compared Bush's tax cut proposal to Reagan's own income tax cuts of
two decades ago, saying that it was ``exactly what we did to get
this prosperity begun in the first place, back in the early '80s
under President Reagan.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, speaking to reporters, Cheney said the boom was created
by 20 years of strong leadership by the Federal Reserve, reductions
in military spending after the Cold War and the tax policies of
Reagan and even those of President George Bush. ``My analysis would
be a 20-year look at the economy and policy, not just the last
eight years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still later in the day, an aide said Cheney wanted to clarify
that he also gave a measure of credit to President Clinton for
``reluctantly signing'' fiscal measures approved by the Republican
Congress,
</P>
<P>
   The argument over surpluses and deficits is a muddy one because
accounts of how much each candidate will spend depends on estimates
and projections.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Republican analysis found, for example, that Gore's
proposals would overshoot the available surplus by as little as $27
billion over 10 years if the costs of Gore's spending plans are
assumed to be at the low end of credible estimates.
</P>
<P>
   If the costs of the spending plans are assumed to be at the high
end of estimates, Gore's budget would be in the red by as much as
$906 billion over 10 years, the report said. For example, the
report noted that Gore says his plan to increase retirement savings
would cost $200 billion over 10 years, while other estimates put
the cost at as much as $750 billion. The Gore campaign dismissed
the report as partisan.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign says that the governor's own budget plan
leaves a $265 billion surplus. But John Cogan, an economics adviser
to Bush, acknowledged Wednesday as he was briefing reporters on
Gore's spending that the Bush figures did not account for the costs
of deploying a missile defense system, but only for research and
development. Bush has called for a far more robust system than the
one that Clinton had been contemplating at a cost of $60 billion.
Cogan argued that Bush could make other savings in military
spending to offset the costs.

 &HT;    Business airfares expected to increase
 &HT;    By Nancy Fonti
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Business travelers can expect to dig deeper into their pockets
to pay for their airline tickets next year, a survey by American
Express's travel service unit says.
</P>
<P>
   Robust demand for travel and soaring jet fuel prices will push
business airfares up to 5 percent higher next year. That increase
is slightly less than the annual 6 percent jump business tickets
have averaged in the past two years, which followed a period in
which fares were fairly flat.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter of this year, the ``typical business
fare'' nationwide was an average of $778 roundtrip. That fare,
based on an average of the lowest fully refundable coach fare in
selected markets, will rise to $817 next year, American Express
predicts. Other factors in the airline industry could influence how
much travelers pay. In fact, United Airlines has pledged not to
raise fares for two years if it is allowed to merge with US
Airways. The exception, United has said, is if fuel prices _ now
near record levels _ continue climbing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing that's going to control this is the big promise
United made during the merger,'' said David Stempler, president of
the Air Travelers Association, a travel advocacy group. ''If they
hold the line, it's going to be very difficult to raise fares.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, airlines have boosted business fares 7 percent since
January, with several of the increases tied to the rising cost of
jet fuel, the airlines' second-highest expense after labor. Fuel
could push prices even higher: On Wednesday, crude oil rose to
$34.90 a barrel, the highest since the Gulf War in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines won't be the only companies charging business travelers
more next year. American Express sees hotel rates climbing 6
percent and rental car rates up 5 percent.

 &HT;    IXL walks fine line, analyst warns
 &HT;    By Kathy Brister
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Atlanta-based iXL Enterprises Inc.'s stock, battered in recent
days by an earnings warning and the loss of a key executive,
continued its decline Wednesday, closing at $6.94, down 6 cents.
</P>
<P>
   IXL this week announced cost-cutting measures, including
layoffs, meant to bolster the stock. But job cuts could hurt the
company by bruising employee morale, analysts warned.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies in the same category as iXL _ those that develop
online strategies, Web sites and Internet applications for other
firms _ also have seen a slowdown in business and a sag in stock
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive Bert Ellis said Tuesday iXL would begin trimming
``anything that isn't productive to the company,'' including
employees. IXL wouldn't elaborate. The company employs 3,000
worldwide and 800 locally.
</P>
<P>
   BB&AMP;T Capital Markets analyst Thomas Neuhaus gave iXL's planned
layoffs mixed reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``(IXL's) hired a lot of people anticipating greater demand.
Cutting that excess is a positive,'' Neuhaus said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is how the job cuts could affect employee morale, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With iXL, all it has to sell is its people,'' he said. ``IXL's
assets walk out the door every day at 5 p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Malever, chief executive officer of Atlanta-based
recruiting firm Lanta Technology Group, said he's seen an
increasing number of iXL resumes. He said morale drops as stock
dips, and that employees start looking for other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But iXL employees are talented, and the company name adds weight
to resumes, Malever said. He expects most will be absorbed easily
into Atlanta's booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   Neuhaus said iXL must build declining revenue and attract new,
large clients to stand alongside customers like Virgin-Atlantic and
General Electric, which has a 9 percent stake in iXL.
</P>
<P>
   It's worrisome the company hasn't announced a large contract in
about three months, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 20 percent of iXL's revenue comes from start-up
e-commerce firms, yet its troubles are rooted in their growing
pains, Neuhaus said. He said ``the funding environment for dot-coms
went from being extremely robust to almost drying up completely''
after the Nasdaq's spring nose dive.
</P>
<P>
   If the downward spiral had stopped there, iXL probably could
have held tight.
</P>
<P>
   But, less concerned about a competitive threat from fast-moving
start-ups, big firms slowed online plans and stopped snapping up
iXL's services.
</P>
<P>
   Neuhaus predicted a market shakeout but said IXL has the
strength to survive such an evolution.

<P>
   When Ricky Martin swiveled his hips at the 1999 Grammys, he set
off a tide of Latin pop record sales in this country.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half later, on the eve of the first Latin Grammys,
a new group of Internet entrepreneurs is trying to ride that tide
by offering Latin music Web sites that include crash courses in the
different rhythms of mambo, bomba and merengue, and also sell the
latest salsa and rock en Espanol CDs.
</P>
<P>
   And while many Spanish-language music sites originate from
Brazil and Mexico, these upstarts from the United States are in
English to attract a new audience: bilingual Hispanic-Americans as
well as fans who do not speak Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco de la Torre founded Eritmo.com (www2.eritmo.com) one
year ago to fill a void on the Net. Latin music styles vary from
country to country, de la Torre reasoned, so Eritmo.com (``ritmo''
means rhythm in Spanish) customizes news and information with
separate pages and headlines from Puerto Rico, Mexico, Brazil,
Argentina, Venezuela and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Eritmo.com publishes limited concert reviews, news and opinion
articles, and music rankings by country. It also has chats, puzzles
and games. Its Supermall sells CDs by top-of-the-charts Latin
performers and links users to a site to make their own CDs.
</P>
<P>
   If Eritmo.com feels like the sterile but stocked neighborhood
superstore, the LaMusica.com site (www.lamusica.com) is a fan's
basement, crammed with colorful photos and video interviews with
the stars of the Latin pop, salsa, merengue and Tejano scenes. What
LaMusica.com does best is to give access to small concerts and
corner top performers in interesting places. When visited recently,
the site had an interview with Son by Four in Central Park and one
with Marc Anthony, holding forth from a bed (fully clothed). The
site includes timely reviews of festivals sponsored by radio
stations and of rare concert appearances, and links to Latin music
radio shows featuring styles like freestyle and Latin jazz.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish word ``descarga'' means ``to unload,'' but it also
refers to a type of musical jam session. In that spirit,
Descarga.com (www.descarga.com) is an amalgam of opinion,
instruction and sales. Critical essays that assume familiarity with
major figures in Latin music, and rare recordings and percussion
instruments, like afuches and timbales, for sale make the site seem
like a Greenwich Village music shop on the Web. The glossary is
basic but useful for those encountering decades of Latin music for
the first time. The catalog includes hard-to-find recordings like
Israel (Cachao) Lopez's Cuban jam sessions and Afro-Cuban Santeria
vocal and drum music.
</P>
<P>
   Two-year-old LA'Ritmo.com (www.laritmo.com) offers Top 25 charts
in several Latin music genres, as well as the Tu Ritmo collection
of digital sound clips, a handy sampling tool that gives beginners
who cannot decipher Spanish labels a place to start looking for
Latin CDs. The Latino Wired news link chugs with the latest
industry music news and is updated daily; the extensive archives of
reviews, charts and interviews go back two years.
</P>
<P>
   Dgolpe.com (www.dgolpe.com) offers a vast English-, Spanish- and
Portuguese-language digital catalog for downloading, and though the
six-month-old site's name is a pun on the Spanish word for coup,
Dgolpe.com insists that all of its MP3 downloads are legal.
</P>
<P>
   Ritmoteca.com (www.ritmoteca.com), which made its debut in
December, has a Latin catalog on its site, which is decorated with
a deep red border, maracas and bongos. Artists' pages offer brief
biographies and discographies to help users select CDs.
</P>
<P>
   A Latino lifestyle site, Latino.com (www.latino.com), available
in Spanish and English, has an extensive music section, with news
articles on things like hip-hop and salsa, and video links to Latin
artists, but its best item is a map. The clickable, color-coded
guide describes and matches Latin musical genres to their countries
of origin.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There are dozens of fan pages for specific artists and
categories, as well as specialized sites with narrow city and club
guides. Salsaweb.com (www.salsaweb.com) is a bright site with a few
salsa headliner tour schedules, a listing of dance events around
the world and an eclectic collection of features on topics like
Japanese salsa and dance floor etiquette. The Latin Jazz Network
(www.latinjazznet.com) compiles reviews, profiles and in-depth
interviews with musicians, and links users to a calendar of jazz
festivals and other events, as well as to Latin jazz radio stations
online.
</P>
<P>
   For a primer on the backbone of Latin music, the spare but
colorful Latin Rhythms site (www.cam.org/(Tilde)raybiss/rhythms)
pulses with clickable musical staffs and congas with brief
explanatory paragraphs for each pattern of beats. Latin American
Musical Styles (havana.iwsp.com/radio/lamusic) illustrates its
regional glossary of Latin genres, from aguinaldos (Venezuela) to
zouks (French Caribbean), with clickable snippets from popular
recordings of each.
</P>
<P>
   Visually oriented fans can click on a handful of Latin artists'
streaming videos on AllLatinMusictv.com (www.alllatinmusictv.com),
including one from the legendary Celia Cruz and a video of Enrique
Iglesias performing an English cover of Yaz's ``Only You.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Bush tells swing-state voters the debate flap is a test of
Gore's character
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By R.G. RATCLIFFE
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCRANTON, Pa. _ With a new taunt and television commercial,
Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush sought to convince
swing-state voters Wednesday that the debate over where and when to
debate is a test of character for Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's get it on, Mr. Gore,'' Bush said on NBC's ``Today
Show.''
</P>
<P>
   The taunt was meant to prompt Gore into facing off with Bush
next Tuesday on a special edition of ``Meet the Press'' with Tim
Russert. Bush noted that Gore previously said he would debate Bush
on the show as part of his ``any time, anywhere'' challenge.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' said Bush is trying
to avoid debating on what likely would be highly watched events
sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Gore has said
he would consider the NBC and CNN forums only if Bush agrees to the
commission's debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to play games to try to substitute a talk show
for the national bipartisan commission on debates,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has sponsored presidential debates since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Bush on Sunday announced he would debate Gore on ``Meet the
Press'' next week and then the CNN ``Larry King Live'' show next
month. Bush also agreed to participate in late October in one
commission-sponsored debate, rejecting two others.
</P>
<P>
   ABC and CBS officials have said their networks will not carry
debates sponsored by another network, and NBC officials said
Wednesday they will not give Bush an open forum if Gore does not
agree to debate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he is going to Washington on Tuesday no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't given up on the fact that we'll debate on NBC next
Tuesday night with Mr. Russert,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign argues that Bush is choosing the path of least
viewership. King's highest rated audience was 11 million when Gore
debated Ross Perot over the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Meet the Press averages 3.6 million views, the Gore campaign has
said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the commission sponsored presidential debates in
1992 drew 90 million viewers and in 1996, 41 million.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Today Show'' host Matt Lauer asked Bush if he was trying
to avoid large audiences, the Texas governor replied, ``Not at all.
I want as many people watching me debate Al Gore as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has refused to negotiate with the debate commission since
making his proposal on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In a new television commercial that is being put into the
rotation of Bush ads in 21 battleground states, the Bush campaign
says Gore's refusal to meet Bush on NBC next week shows the vice
president is untrustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement said Bush last weekend accepted ``a record
five national debates,'' without mentioning two of those would be
between his running mate, Dick Cheney, and Gore's, Joseph
Lieberman. The commercial goes on to talk about how Gore accepted
debate offers from ``Meet the Press'' and ``Larry King Live''
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was politically convenient, Gore said he'd debate `any
time, anyplace, anywhere.' Now that Governor Bush has accepted,
Gore says, `unacceptable,''' the announcer says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't trust Al Gore on debates, why should we trust him
on anything?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides would not say how often the ad is running or
divulge the number of states where it is running.

 &HT;    CLINTON MEETS WITH ARAFAT, BARAK WARNING CHANCE FOR MIDEAST
PEACE 'FLEETING'

8:15 p.m. ET briefing on Barak, Arafat meetings.
 &HT;    With CLINTON-UN-0907.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ With time running out on his dream of brokering a
Mideast peace accord, President Clinton huddled Wednesday with
Israeli and Palestinian leaders, trying to break their latest
diplomatic logjam.
</P>
<P>
   Making a bid for urgency, Clinton appealed for global backing
for his efforts to craft a peace treaty acceptable to both Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need your support now, more than ever, to take the hard
risks for peace,'' Clinton said in remarks to the United Nations
General Assembly, the body's annual conference of international
leaders. ``They have the chance to do it. But, like all life's
chances, it is fleeting and about to pass. There is not a moment to
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton held separate meetings with Arafat and Barak in a
luxury hotel in downtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   It was Clinton's first meeting with the two leaders since his
efforts to press them toward a peace accord collapsed in July at
the Camp David presidential retreat. There, two weeks of summitry
fell apart over the issue of Jerusalem, a city holy to Christians,
Jews and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has demanded full sovereignty over East Jerusalem, the
center of Palestinian social, cultural and economic life.
</P>
<P>
   The territory, though, which Israel seized in the 1967
Arab-Israeli war, contains sites holy to all three major religions
and holds deep historic meaning to Israelis and Palestinians alike.
</P>
<P>
   Barak offered Arafat partial sovereignty over the disputed land,
but Arafat rejected that formulation.
</P>
<P>
   In their own U.N. remarks on Wednesday, Arafat and Barak sent
mixed signals.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat hinted, for instance, that he was willing to drop his
threat to declare Palestinian statehood on Sept. 13, so long as he
sees a chance for progress on the diplomatic front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our friends and brothers consider that reaching a
final settlement requires allowing an additional chance for these
efforts to succeed,'' Arafat said, adding that he would take up
that prospect at a meeting of the Palestinian Central Council this
weekend in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   In the same speech, though, Arafat blasted Israel, casting the
Jewish state as the villain in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confronting Israeli attempts at the Judaization of
Jerusalem,'' Arafat said, ``land confiscation, the building of
illegal Israeli settlements, the siege imposed upon Bethlehem, and
the lack of honest and accurate implementation of the agreements
signed by Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat went on to characterize Jerusalem as ``the cradle of
Christ and the site of Prophet Mohammed's ascension to heaven,''
leaving out the city's even longer history as the center of Judaism
and accusing Israel of attempts at ``monopolizing'' the ancient
city.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, for his part, stressed the 3,000-year history of Judaism
in Jerusalem, quoting Old Testament scripture, even as he called
upon Arafat to embrace compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerusalem, the eternal capital of Israel, now calls for a
peace of honor, of courage and of brotherhood,'' said Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that Jerusalem is also sacred to Muslims and
Christians the world over and cherished by our Palestinian
neighbors,'' Barak said. ``A true peace will reflect all these
bonds. Jerusalem will remain united and open to all who love her.''

   Barak offered Arafat partial sovereignty over the disputed land,
but Arafat rejected that formulation.
</P>
<P>
   In their own U.N. remarks on Wednesday, Arafat and Barak sent
mixed signals.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat hinted, for instance, that he was willing to drop his
threat to declare Palestinian statehood on Sept. 13, so long as he
sees a chance for progress on the diplomatic front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our friends and brothers consider that reaching a
final settlement requires allowing an additional chance for these
efforts to succeed,'' Arafat said, adding that he would take up
that prospect at a meeting of the Palestinian Central Council this
weekend in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   In the same speech, though, Arafat blasted Israel, casting the
Jewish state as the villain in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confronting Israeli attempts at the Judaization of
Jerusalem,'' Arafat said, ``land confiscation, the building of
illegal Israeli settlements, the siege imposed upon Bethlehem, and
the lack of honest and accurate implementation of the agreements
signed by Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat went on to characterize Jerusalem as ``the cradle of
Christ and the site of Prophet Mohammed's ascension to heaven,''
leaving out the city's even longer history as the center of Judaism
and accusing Israel of attempts at ``monopolizing'' the ancient
city.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, for his part, stressed the 3,000-year history of Judaism
in Jerusalem, quoting Old Testament scripture, even as he called
upon Arafat to embrace compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerusalem, the eternal capital of Israel, now calls for a
peace of honor, of courage and of brotherhood,'' said Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that Jerusalem is also sacred to Muslims and
Christians the world over and cherished by our Palestinian
neighbors,'' Barak said. ``A true peace will reflect all these
bonds. Jerusalem will remain united and open to all who love her.''

   There was much joking at the White House on Tuesday, Sept. 5,
about  &UR; George W. Bush &LR; 's widely heard ``aside'' to  &UR; Dick Cheney &LR;  on
Monday, when he called New York Times reporter &UR; Adam Clymer &LR;  a

reporters at Rose Garden ceremonies, ``We like all of you.''

   Salon.com referred to previous reports of George W. using
colorful language, particularly in a 1988 conversation with the

you and your father talk about?'' he was asked. A small cat, he
said, but his answer was in the form of one word.
</P>

   Meanwhile, the Washington Post asked several people who know
Clymer for their opinions. ``He's a big teddy bear,'' said Health
and Human Services Secretary  &UR; Donna Shalala &LR; . ``It's actually a
charge that any good reporter should take pride in,'' said  &UR; Tony &LR;

   POST TIME: In Congress' final month, leaders of the U.S. racing
business are waiting for U.S. House leadership to decide the fate
of the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act. While the bill's name
suggests those in the industry may hope for its failure, the
reverse is true because it includes language clarifying legality of
what racing has done for years _ simulcasting, telephone betting
and other interstate activity _ in a gray area of the law. Its
opponents include anti-gambling groups who complain there are too
many exemptions; state lotteries and Native American gambling
interests that want to operate online; and people opposed to any
Internet regulation. Under the bill's language, an interstate bet
is legal if it is legal in the state where it is received.

IN SOME STATES, SPEEDERS COOL THEIR HEELS IN ONLINE CLASSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By KAREN J. BANNAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sue Welsh received a speeding ticket while driving her car this
year. Facing a point on her license and a possible increase in
insurance rates, she had two options. She could go to a
state-sponsored traffic safety school to wipe out any penalty on
her license or go to court to contest the charge and take her
chances with the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Although Welsh, a law school librarian from Acampo, Calif.,
preferred the class option, she was worried that she would not be
able to find one that fit into her busy schedule. When she got her
paperwork from the court, she was happy to discover that there was
an online driving school that she could attend whenever she felt
like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a new job, and I was really afraid I wouldn't be able to
take my traffic school classes,'' Welsh said. ``I actually finished
the course at work on my lunch hour, and it was incredibly
convenient.''
</P>
<P>
   Welsh is among a small but growing group of drivers who are
opting to take driver safety classes online. The classes use
streaming video, lessons and online tests to accomplish what
usually takes four to eight hours to do in a classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Although students can end up spending the same amount of time
online, many find the online classes more convenient because they
can take them whenever they want. A student can spend 10 minutes
with the program and go back to it the next day to pick it up at
the same point. Most driving schools taught in classrooms require
students to put in a seven-hour stretch on a Saturday or Sunday or
two nights during the week. And online students can save money
because the classes start at $19.95.
</P>
<P>
   The online programs available now include a pilot program
sponsored by the National Safety Council and three commercial
Web-based programs, TrafficSchoolOnline.com
(trafficschoolonline.com), TrafficSchool.com (trafficschool.com)
and Web Traffic School (webtrafficschoolcom). Although anyone with
access to the Web can take the programs, they are certified in only
a handful of states. Even within those states, certification varies
from one jurisdiction to another. California, where Welsh lives,
was one of the first states to accredit online programs. Nevada,
Arizona, Florida, Ohio, Oregon, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and
Wyoming followed with limited programs of their own, according to
the owners of the Web-based schools.
</P>
<P>
   Online classes are not an option in New York state. Unlike many
other states, New York's traffic safety schools primarily attract
drivers who want to lower their insurance costs by 10 percent. More
than 500,000 New York state residents take the six-hour classes
each year, and only about 10 percent of them do so to reduce the
number of points on their licenses, said Joe Picchi, associate
commissioner for communications at the New York State Department of
Motor Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the New York legislature approved a bill that would
have let New York drivers take online traffic classes that would
have been similar to those available in other states. But the bill
was vetoed by Gov. George Pataki, who said he was concerned about
fraud. ``These programs pose special challenges in respect to
verifying the identity of individuals taking the course,'' Pataki
said in his written veto message.
</P>
<P>
   Since courses are taken entirely online, students can have other
people take the classes for them or have other applications or
browsers open while the course is running. The creators of the
online courses are looking at technology like speech recognition
and other strategies for weeding out cheaters.
</P>
<P>
   To address the question of deception, TrafficSchoolOnline.com
recently joined forces with Kinko's copy centers in California,
Virginia, Maryland, Oregon and Washington, D.C., in a pilot program
that is designed to put officials at ease. Students in the pilot
program take lessons online, but they are required to take a final
exam at a Kinko's center, where where they must show photo
identification cards. After they pass the exam, they get their
course certificates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, people do the course in a week or two,'' said
Samuel Crump, president of the TrafficSchoolOnline.com, which is
based in Santa Rosa, Calif., ``and even though they have to go into
Kinko's to take the test, they are still ahead because they can
take their time and really learn the material.''
</P>
<P>
   Web Traffic School is taking a different approach by working on
a voice-recognition component for its online course. When students
sign up for the course, they must speak into their computers, using
a microphone attached to the computer. They can also call into the
service using a regular telephone. During the course, the students
are periodically prompted to verify their identities the same way.
Telephone users can be called on the phone at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only give people 30 seconds to speak into the microphone,
so you don't have enough time to call your spouse into the room to
speak their name,'' said Isaak Tsifrin, the chief executive officer
and founder of Interactive Solutions, the parent company of Web
Traffic School, in Oakland, Calif. ``We also retain the right to
call the students to make sure it's actually them.''
</P>
<P>
   Picchi said New York State could decide to allow the online
courses in the near future, after the Department of Motor Vehicles
completes an assessment of the state program for reducing driver's
license points or insurance rates. ``There are sponsors that have
come to us with ideas for an online program,'' he said. ``We're
considering them, but right now we want to make sure that the
current program is effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Welsh said she had liked her online traffic safety course, which
she took at Web Traffic School. ``Ordinarily I would prefer a
classroom situation, but this was a great alternative,'' she said.
``I really feel I learned a lot, and I got 100 percent on the
test.''

   SONGS OF WOE: After years out of the spotlight, outlaw country
singer-songwriter David Allan Coe is cool again, thanks to an
opening slot on Kid Rock's current tour and a shout-out on the
rapper's hit single ''American Bad A--.'' But The New York Times
reports that Coe's decision to re-release two widely bootlegged
early-'80s albums _ originally sold through biker magazines while
Coe was riding with a motorcycle gang, and generally considered to
be ''among the most racist, misogynist, homophobic and obscene
songs recorded by a popular songwriter'' _ has many fans wondering
how Rock, ''who has collaborated with black rappers and has made a
living through appropriating their music, can be touring with a
songwriter responsible for blatantly anti-black material.'' Coe is
selling the albums through his so-so Web site,
officialdavidallancoe.com, as a single-CD set, for $45, although he
refuses to put his name on the disc or its packaging.

   LEGAL MISSTEP: No lifelines, please, but answer the following:
Which of these actual lawsuits is more trivial? A) A blind man sued
by a woman because he stepped on her foot, or B) a suit filed by
college student who fell from his dorm window while ``mooning''
friends? These cases were included in an Internet poll of
outrageous suits conducted by Michigan Lawsuit Abuse Watch, which
intends to use the Whiplash Awards for America's most frivolous
lawsuits in much the same way the Golden Fleece tackles government
waste. Overall, 2,100 online voters chose a Florida woman for the
dubious distinction of suing a school for guide-dogs after a blind
man who was using one of the dogs stepped on her foot. No Georgia
cases were among the finalists.

 &HT;    Bar brouhaha begs question: New York _ or Mayberry?
 &HT;    Should we try to mimic New York _ or Mayberry?
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Well, we all know what John Rocker's answer would be.
</P>
<P>
   The question? Actually, it was more of a challenge that Atlanta
city Councilman Michael Bond issued Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta has to decide,'' Bond said during a tense council
meeting and vote on bar closing times, ``whether it's going to be
New York City or Mayberry, because it can't be both.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming on the heels of a TV commercial in which Jacksonville's
mayor slams Atlanta as hell with HOV lanes, this latest, largely
self-induced, civic identity crisis naturally set tongues wagging.
</P>
<P>
   And not just in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   First, Gotham weighed in on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would advise all cities to strive to be like New York
City,'' Curt Ritter, chief spokesman for New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, said with a slight ``you should be so lucky'' lilt to his
voice. ``As the safest large city in America, we are certainly the
cultural capital of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Goober's hometown was heard from.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Atlanta should retain some of its Southern charm,''
advised Ann Vaughn, director of the Visitors Center in Mount Airy,
N.C., which native son Andy Griffith lovingly re-created as the
fictional Mayberry on his long-running TV show. ``Atlanta or New
York, they're wonderful to visit, but it really does make you
appreciate your small-town roots.''
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, bars can stay open until 4 a.m., which some here
link to a recent rise in violent crime in Buckhead and other parts
of the city. Meanwhile, in Mayberry, er, Mount Airy, you can't even
buy liquor by the drink, and most restaurants close by 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Yet New York City bars close anywhere between midnight and 4
a.m., Ritter says, and the city is ``safer than ever.'' So safe _
he couldn't resist adding from the city whose Mets and Yankees are
the Braves' biggest rivals _ that ``as we approach the playoff
season, New York City's baseball teams would be safer in the Bronx
or Queens than they would be in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Memo to Atlanta City Council: Go Goober.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Vejnoska writes for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

IT'S HARD ADAPTING HENRY JAMES. STILL, THEY KEEP TRYING .
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 10) 
 By LISA ZEIDNER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ladies with lacy parasols, twilit mansions with topiary mazes:
There's no huge mystery about why filmmakers would be attracted to
Henry James novels. Adapting James is a more dignified undertaking
than filming ``Lethal Weapon IV''; Henry James shot-puts us into
the land of Art, of substance and gravitas. Besides, there are only
so many Jane Austen novels.
</P>
<P>
   We've thus seen, in quick succession, Jane Campion's ``Portrait
of a Lady'' (1996), Agnieszka Holland's ``Washington Square''
(1997) and Iain Softley's ``Wings of the Dove'' (1998) _ as if
there were an antitrust suit to bust up the Merchant-Ivory monopoly
on James, which has produced ``The Europeans'' (1979), ``The
Bostonians'' (1984) and, coming on Nov. 3, ``The Golden Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   But contrary to the appearance of a mini-boom, filmmakers have
in fact been steadily filming James for over a half-century. Since
1947, at least 30 James novels and stories have been brought to big
and small screen, mostly to give sundry ``it'' girls a chance to
dress up. ``The Heiress,'' William Wyler's 1949 version of
``Washington Square,'' stars Olivia de Havilland, and Peter
Bogdanovich bathes Cybill Shepherd in golden light in ``Daisy
Miller'' (1974). ``The Innocents'' (1961), based on ``The Turn of
the Screw,'' stars Deborah Kerr; John Frankenheimer directed Ingrid
Bergman in the same vehicle, for television, in 1959. Ten
adaptations of ``The Turn of the Screw'' feature evil children
torturing their governesses _ which means, of course, that without
Henry James there would be no ``Omen IV: The Awakening.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the respectful good will of these efforts, most of the
films lose James in the translation. Either they aim for stately _
and become deadly dull, or they trump the drama with swelling
scores and shouting matches more appropriate for a daytime soap.
What no filmmaker has yet found is a way to capture James' gently
acid tone. The last decade's adjective of the moment, ``edgy,''
might have been invented for the novelist's dark, layered ironies.
But to understand his tone, we must understand his culture. Making
sense of James' characters requires sharing assumptions about money
and manners that simply don't compute for a contemporary audience.
The films therefore resort to screaming clues through a megaphone _
and thus sacrifice subtlety in stories that pretty much depend on
subtlety.
</P>
<P>
   They're costume dramas, so let's start with the costumes.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Golden Bowl,'' James' novel about a nasty love
quadrangle, Maggie sits at home, pretending to read. Really she
awaits her husband, who, Maggie suspects, is having an affair with
her best friend, Charlotte, who, it so happens, is also her
father's wife. But Maggie will not make a scene. She waits quietly,
in a brand-new dress. She does not even indulge in the luxury of
pacing. Would Charlotte like the dress? Probably not, although the
hyper-polite Charlotte would never say so.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the challenge of translating this one crucial scene to
the screen. In the new film, directed by James Ivory, Maggie
forgoes dignity and hurls herself dolefully on the floor in front
of the fire. When hubby finally returns, he compliments the frock.
``You like it?'' Maggie says. ``I wore it tonight for dinner _ for
you. But you had dined.'' Point taken: She's on to him. But how to
reveal Maggie's thoughts about Charlotte without Charlotte's
appearing on the scene, without even a word of dialogue?
</P>
<P>
   That is the almost wholly internal drama of ``The Golden Bowl,''
and it could not be less cinematic. The risk of trying to film such
scenes, of course, is that you reduce the novels to fancy-dress
balls _ and let's face it, a contemporary audience can barely tell
a tasteful gown from a tacky one. Unfortunate, since there's no
doubt that James takes the clothes seriously, as does Isabel
Archer, the heroine of ``The Portrait of a Lady,'' when she
proclaims: ``I've a great respect for things! One's self _ for
other people _ is one's expression of one's self; and one's house,
one's furniture, one's garments, the books one reads, the company
one keeps _ these are all expressive.''
</P>
<P>
   To make sure we can read the signs of ``Washington Square'' _
James' consideration of gold-digging _ Agnieszka Holland dresses up
Jennifer Jason Leigh for the ball so that she looks like an
upholstered sofa bought at a yard sale. Plus she can't dance and
trips a lot. She's such a hopeless plain Jane that we know her
father's right: Her suitor can only be after her money. But if
that's too obvious, where's the suspense? In the film, what you see
is what you get. In the novel, you're not sure what you're seeing
or getting; James thus forces readers to reconsider their
suppositions about marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Austen's young women don't have to choose love or money.
They generally get both. Not so in James, whose marrying maidens
get betrayals, intrigues and disappointments. In a way, ``The
Portrait of a Lady'' seems ripe for contemporary retelling. But in
updating the characters, Jane Campion loses the story's sense and
center.
</P>
<P>
   Campion wants to portray Isabel as a feminist free spirit. So
while the other damsels at the ball in ``The Portrait of a Lady''
faint, presumably from the corsets, Nicole Kidman struts about with
her burnished hair wild and aswirl, utterly indifferent to her
clothes, her eyes red-rimmed. Yet Isabel is supposed to be the
ultimate social creature, so charming she needs no dowry. If she's
going to spend all her time crying or almost-crying, oblivious to
everyone, why should so many suitors ardently want her?
</P>
<P>
   Why Isabel chooses Gilbert Osmond (John Malkovich), a bald boor
in the slimiest of smoking jackets, is unclear too, although
Campion throws in a little fantasy sequence of a menage a trois to
suggest that it has something to do with sexuality. (``Director's
Cut: The Playboy Mansion Footage''?) Campion actually has Osmond
strike Isabel, something the King of Decorousness never even comes
close to doing in the novel. As a portrait of a marriage, the film
is less Henry James than ``The Ike and Tina Story.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Not that you can blame directors for wanting to offer us
something to watch. In ``Washington Square,'' Holland has her
heroine chase her ex-beau's carriage, in pouring rain, and fall
sobbing in the mud. (In the novel, stiff upper lip prevails.) Here,
in the book, is how Isabel realizes that her husband and his old
friend Serena Merle are, as James would say, ``familiarly
associated'': She sees them talking near the fire. But Madame Merle
stands while Osmond remains seated. James doesn't need to alert his
readers to what such rudeness means in a gentleman: ``The thing
made an image, lasting only a moment, like a flicker of light.''
Try that on for size for a film's big Act Two reversal. Jane
Campion gives up on making the discovery vibrant; she just has
someone tell Isabel flat out. But once you excise the psychological
unfolding, what do you have? Just another fool for love, with
period accents.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail Merchant and James Ivory don't generally make these kinds
of blunders. Say what you will about filmmakers so tasteful they
have their own coffee-table book (``Merchant Ivory's English
Landscape: Rooms, Views, and Anglo-Saxon Attitudes''), after 45
films they can help an actress wear a bustle without looking like a
buffoon. The camera caresses the country estates. You can feel both
the seduction of the moneyed life and its concurrent risk of
hollowness. Moreover, the filmmakers have feelings about
expatriates' belonging and longing, those critical Jamesian themes.
</P>
<P>
   If you need to see how far Merchant and Ivory have advanced the
look and feel of the cinematic James, revisit the 1969 BBC
production of ``The Portrait of a Lady,'' a studio piece of the old
school. The light, the clothes, the wainscoting: Everything looks
brown. The point of the story is muddy as well. And the blather!
It's enough to make you want to hurl yourself face down in the mud.
Merchant and Ivory's longtime screenwriter, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala,
mercifully strips down the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   But Merchant and Ivory may be growing tired of the ``tasteful''
label. No more English reserve for them; ``The Golden Bowl'' goes
all Italian, rococo and operatic. More sweeping vistas, more gilded
interiors, a drunken bacchanal reminiscent of a Victorian ``Animal
House,'' molto sobbing, even (duck!) that bonus passionate smack to
the face. Surprising, since this is the quietest of James' novels _
a book about secrecy and decoding in which hardly anyone says
anything to anyone about anything. But perhaps for that very
reason, the script shifts the focus from the cuckolded parties to
the adulterers. (At least they're doing something.)
</P>
<P>
   To help us see the dangers of wealth, Maggie's father, the
American millionaire Adam Verver (Nick Nolte), is made not a
homebody but Citizen Kane-ish in his isolation, hoarding his
goodies while his young bride (Uma Thurman) plays solitaire in the
drafty mansion. (In today's movies, being able to afford a
governess, no less a wing of an estate for her, makes a character
highly suspect and ripe for satanic takeover. But James liked
money. Maybe we have to wait for the ``Clueless''-style update, in
which Adam Verver is an Internet billionaire building a pleasure
palace in Seattle, to understand that.)
</P>
<P>
   To Ivory's credit, it's a briskly paced two-hour film. You'd
need a six-part mini-series to be true to the novel. Actually,
there  &UR; is  &LR; a six-part mini-series of ``The Golden Bowl'' (BBC,
1972). Made before the ``Brideshead Revisited'' revolution in
British television, it's long-winded, the casting off. Still, a
mini-series could allow you to dwell on each unnerving revelation,
and to do tight reaction shots without looking pretentious. Time to
crack out Michael Gambon, Jeremy Irons, Helen Mirren, Ian Holm, the
entire cast of ``Pride and Prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of the actors and actresses do get recycled from
one period film and television show to another. Kate Beckinsale,
from the A&AMP;E ``Emma,'' appears as Maggie in ``The Golden Bowl'';
her husband, Amerigo, is Jeremy Northam, who plays Emma's suitor
Knightley in the feature film version of ``Emma.'' Not that these
actors aren't capable; but it does triple the ``Wait, didn't I
already see this period movie?'' double take.
</P>
<P>
   James gives actors eerily little to do. Actors must be
expressive with the least possible wailing or ground-pounding _
often through nothing more than a hesitation or a veiled glance.
They can't just hammer on one note, either. Each performance must
be deep and protean. Because the vehicles are by necessity so
quiet, with James the directing is paramount. The director must
provide a controlling voice and make sense of all the conflicting
clues.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the film that best manages such Jamesian complexity is
Iain Softley's ``Wings of the Dove.'' The costume-drama queen
Helena Bonham Carter, her bare shoulders aglow against Venetian
stucco, wears gowns of sapphire blue so rich you understand why she
would sell her soul in order to be able to afford them. Softley
generally admits only one color per scene _ a bright red taxi, that
deep and luscious blue _ while the rest of the world recedes into
gritty gray. Each frame of this film is so visually charged that
you could watch it without the sound and still be bombarded by
signals of posture, personality, reaction, interaction. Softley
updates the novel from 1902 to 1910, a period of social transition
and uncertainty. It's not James' period, but at least it's a
period.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't hurt that Linus Roache is as beautiful to look at as
the very different women (one worldly, one virginal) vying for his
attention. And he's new. When the American heiress spies Roache's
character for the first time from a balcony, hers is not the only
breath taken away. Glamorous and brooding, alternately shy and sly:
He's the perfect Jamesian boy-toy.The movie's climactic nude scene
captures the bleakness of the novel, in which the characters
``attempted to bury in the dark blindness of each other's arms the
knowledge of each other that they couldn't undo.''
</P>
<P>
   While ``The Wings of the Dove'' may be the most menacing James
novel, even it is often quite funny. We're still waiting for a
James movie with a sense of humor. ``I, Claudius,'' ``The Young
Catherine'': Once more, it's television, as opposed to film, that
seems to have managed a way to season period gravity with irony.
(Hot tip to development folk: Still awaiting adaptation is James'
seriocomic gem ``What Maisie Knew,'' a child's-eye view of an ugly
divorce.)
</P>
<P>
   One final plea to James adaptors of the future. Please lose the
madcap accents. Being an American abroad does not require you to
speak like Scarlett O'Hara. Nor do you need to speak really, really
loudly, as Kathy Bates does in ``Titanic,'' to show how crass you
are. In ``The Golden Bowl,'' both Anjelica Huston and Nick Nolte
sport intermittent Texas or Carolina twangs. Only the English
actress Kate Beckinsale manages an appropriate American accent.
</P>
<P>
   But then, this is why we like English actors in our period
pieces. They can do accents because they mostly understand the
notion of class, and Americans mostly don't. Which is why James
didn't deign to live on our shores _ and why translating his
byzantine class consciousness into film terms is close to
impossible.

<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. _ Gov. George W. Bush opened a new line of
attack against his Democratic rival Wednesday, accusing Vice
President Al Gore of making so many promises in this campaign that
he would eat through the entire $4.6 trillion federal surplus
projected for the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Bush chose the economy and fiscal policy as his targets on the
same day that Gore unveiled an ambitious and detailed economic
blueprint that called for the creation of a $300 billion rainy day
fund to be set aside for emergencies, like if the economy slows
down.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign took out a full page advertisement in some
regional editions of USA Today quoting six Nobel laureates and
nearly 300 other economists praising Bush's approach to fiscal
policy. The Texas governor also seized on an analysis released by
Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee, who said the vice
president's programs could range as high as $906 billion more than
he has estimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want America to add up all the promises my opponent has
made,'' Bush told a crowd at an airport rally in Scranton, Pa.,
early Wednesday morning. ``All the promises over the course of this
campaign. He has the easy style of campaigning. Go to one community
and make a promise here, go to another community. When you add it
all up he's spent the entire surplus on bigger government. He won't
admit it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor stood before a large blowup poster of the USA
Today ad and used it to contrast his economic plan with Gore's.
``My plan has been endorsed by these Nobel prize winners and
leading economists,'' Bush said. ``His plan has been endorsed by
Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's charges were a mirror image of the Gore campaign's
assertions that it is the Republican nominee who is threatening the
surplus with his spending programs and his proposal to enact a $1.3
trillion tax cut over 10 years. When Bush unveiled a $198 billion
plan on Tuesday to change the Medicare system, Gore said, ``There
is no money to pay for it if you give away all of the surplus in
the form of a giant tax cut for the wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   At every campaign rally, Bush is now featuring blue-collar
families who he says would receive large reductions under his tax
cut plan, but who would receive little to nothing from Gore's
proposals for smaller, more targeted tax cuts for such expenses as
college education or home health care. ``We trust you with your
money,'' Bush told crowds Wednesday as he promoted his tax cut in
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Indiana. ``We trust you to make
decisions with your lives. We don't trust bureaucrats in
Washington, D.C. We don't believe in planners and deciders making
decisions on behalf of America.''
</P>
<P>
   At another airport rally here he appropriated Gore's theme of
helping ``working families'' and thundered, ``Guess which plan is
on the side of the working people? It's our plan. It's our plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's turn to economic themes Wednesday was echoed by his
running mate, Dick Cheney, who campaigned before a chamber of
commerce in Wilmington, Del. He said that he believed the economic
policies of President Reagan should get a strong measure of credit
for the booming economy of the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Answering a question from a member of the audience, Cheney
compared Bush's tax cut proposal to Reagan's own income tax cuts of
two decades ago, saying that it was ``exactly what we did to get
this prosperity begun in the first place, back in the early '80s
under President Reagan.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, speaking to reporters, Cheney said the boom was created
by 20 years of strong leadership by the Federal Reserve Board,
reductions in military spending after the Cold War and the tax
policies of Reagan and even those of President George Bush. ``My
analysis would be a 20-year look at the economy and policy, not
just the last eight years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still later in the day, an aide said Cheney wanted to clarify
that he also gave a measure of credit to President Clinton for
``reluctantly signing'' fiscal measures approved by the Republican
Congress,
</P>
<P>
   The argument over surpluses and deficits is a muddy one because
accounts of how much each candidate will spend depends on estimates
and projections.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Republican analysis found, for example, that Gore's
proposals would overshoot the available surplus by as little as $27
billion over 10 years if the costs of Gore's spending plans are
assumed to be at the low end of credible estimates.
</P>
<P>
   If the costs of the spending plans are assumed to be at the high
end of estimates, Gore's budget would be in the red by as much as
$906 billion over 10 years, the report said. For example, the
report noted that Gore says his plan to increase retirement savings
would cost $200 billion over 10 years, while other estimates put
the cost at as much as $750 billion. The Gore campaign dismissed
the report as partisan.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign says that the governor's own budget plan
leaves a $265 billion surplus. But John Cogan, an economics adviser
to Bush, acknowledged Wednesday as he was briefing reporters on
Gore's spending that the Bush figures did not account for the costs
of deploying a missile defense system, but only for research and
development. Bush has called for a far more robust system than the
one that Clinton had been contemplating at a cost of $60 billion.
Cogan argued that Bush could make other savings in military
spending to offset the costs.

`SUNDAY' IS A BUSTED PLAY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Short fact box below) 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Popping the disc of Oliver Stone's ``Any Given Sunday'' into the
DVD player after taking in parts of four NFL games over the weekend
is, to say the least, a weird experience.
</P>
<P>
   Stone _ who already has taken on the Vietnam War (``Platoon''
and ``Born on the Fourth of July''), conspiracy (``JFK''), abuse of
power and politics (``Nixon''), big money (``Wall Street'') _ gives
us his unique take on another American fixation: football. Of
course, the pro game has all of the above, plus it deals with just
about every aspect of society, from race relations to the role of
media to hype and celebrity, etc.
</P>
<P>
   What Stone offers up is a burned-out coach (Al Pacino) whose
obsession with the game has left him lonely, a hotshot young
quarterback (Jamie Foxx) who is only in it for the money and
believes he's gotten a raw deal because he's African American, an
old star quarterback (Dennis Quaid) who just won't quit despite all
the signs from his body that he should, and young owner (Cameron
Diaz) who is worried about the bottom line and winning _ as it
relates to the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface it sounds formulaic but _ Stone being Stone _ it
wildly zigzags _ like a quarterback scrambling on a busted play _
between cliches and the outrageous, and most of the time the plot
hardly seems to matter. You get the feeling that Stone himself is
conflicted about the game. (Interestingly, he has cast himself as
sort of a rah-rah play-by-play announcer.) He probably is like a
lot of us who overlook the seamier aspects of what goes on around
pro football.
</P>
<P>
   And you'd have to be in denial not to be aware of them, either;
read the sports pages, and you're as likely to find items about
players involved in domestic violence cases or drug taking and
sleazy dealings by greedy owners as you are about a fabulous catch
or an outstanding kick return.
</P>
<P>
   The hypocrisy, brutality and business of pro football has
already been done quite well in the 1979 film ``North Dallas
Forty,'' starring Nick Nolte, but Stone updates it in eye-opening
ways (literally, but we won't go into that). Like many of Stone's
films, ``Sunday'' is hyper-reality, and he brings it home with
dizzying on-field shots. Though the team in the film is fictitious
(the Miami Sharks) as is the league, it isn't isn't a stretch to
see who in the real NFL Stone was thinking of. He also populates
the film with numerous real football figures such as Jim Brown and
Lawrence Taylor. There's even a character, Jack Rose (John C.
McGinley), obviously modeled on obnoxious sport talk personality
Jim Rome, who former Rams quarterback Jim Everett once attacked
during an interview. When Pacino's character knocks Rose down, it
elicits about as much sympathy as some people probably had about
Rome getting knocked down _ none.
</P>
<P>
   Stone doesn't score with ``Sunday''; he doesn't even make a
first down, but there is enough razzle-dazzle and even a few
interesting insights to keep you watching.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Stone's 1986 Oscar-winning ``Platoon'' has
become available on DVD for the first time. It is a far superior
film, and Stone _ a Vietnam veteran _ brings some moving
intangibles to the film that outweigh its occasional
heavyhandedness. &QL; 
---
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Given Sunday'' (Warners) is priced for rental on VHS at
$106.99. The director's cut DVD is $24.90 and includes six minutes
of deleted footage; ``Full Contact,'' a making-of documentary; and
LL Cool J's ``Shut 'Em Down'' music video. ``Platoon'' (MGM) is
$19.99 on DVD. &QL;

RWANDA'S PRESIDENT CALLS FOR MORE U.N. EXPERTISE TO HELP COUNTRY
REBUILD 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Less than two weeks after experts told the
United Nations that it needed an in-house policy center to work on
areas of tension before they turn into international crises,
President Paul Kagame of Rwanda came along Tuesday with a case in
point.
</P>
<P>
   More than six years after a frenzy of ethnic killing tore his
small African country apart, armed militia and former soldiers
thought to be guilty of some of the killings are still roaming free
in neighboring Congo. A plan to deal with them should have been
worked out long ago by U.N. officials drawing on their experience
and collective skills, Kagame said in an interview. To him, they
are the reason there is a war in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   In New York for a meeting of world leaders, Kagame said that
until the Hutu responsible for killing Tutsi and their moderate
Hutu allies are disarmed and resettled somewhere in peace, Rwandan
troops will stay in Congo. The presence of foreign troops _ from
Rwanda, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia _ is also a major
impediment to dispatching a U.N. peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.N. has enough resources and expertise _ and even
experience from other situations _ to come up with a proposal,''
Kagame said. Breaking the cycle of blame and counter-blame between
Rwanda and the Congolese government would mean separating fewer
than 10,000 Rwandans who, he said, are mixed with troops from Congo
and its allies, particularly Zimbabwe and Angola.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many ways of dealing with the problem,'' he said.
``One is working together to see that these people don't get
support from other governments. Then you can move farther and
identify where they are. Let's put them into camps and disarm them.
Let's repatriate them to Rwanda or take them elsewhere. I don't see
why the U.N. can fail to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep coming to us and asking us what we feel they should
do, but this is simply escaping the problem, trying to run away
from the problem. They come a hundred times asking the same
questions. I think they'd better get serious and do what they're
supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of exiles have returned voluntarily, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call my bluff,'' he said to those who say that Rwanda really
has designs on territory in eastern Congo. With the former Rwandan
soldiers and militias out of Congo, he said, his troops will come
home.
</P>
<P>
   Kagame said the costly business of keeping Rwandan troops in
Congo to seal the border burdens the reconstruction of Rwanda, a
country of about 7.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Rwanda, like Cambodia, will suffer for a long time
from the loss of much of its middle class in the killings. The
events of 1994 left up to 800,000 Rwandans dead and led several
months later to the overthrow of a Hutu-led government by Tutsi-led
rebels whom Kagame commanded. He has been the central power figure
in Rwanda ever since, although he did not assume the presidency
until this year after a split in his party led to the resignation
of his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   The middle-class professionals lost to Rwanda came from both
ethnic groups. Kagame said that in addition to those who were
killed, many of the 120,000 Rwandans charged in the attacks and
still in jail are also middle class: priests, civil servants, local
political leaders and sometimes teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Kagame, who has tempered the fury he first expressed at the
failure of the United Nations and its leading members, including
the United States and France, to prevent or end the massacres, now
focuses his criticism on what he sees as an international failure
to recognize that a country so profoundly wounded cannot be treated
like just any place.
</P>
<P>
   ``My country has to be treated as a special case,'' he said, and
he intends to make this a theme of his speech this week to world
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   He said Rwanda still has a long way to go toward reconciliation
and the rebuilding of government institutions that can withstand
ethnic tensions. Agriculture, education and health services are
only beginning to be restored.
</P>
<P>
   But he rejected suggestions that the Hutu majority and Tutsi
minority will never be reconciled.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been nothing in the past to demonstrate that they
can't live together,'' he said, ``but I do see a solution in the
better political management of the situation _ better political,
economic and social management of the country.''

IT'S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT
</HEADLINE>
  Attention to details makes for a savvy wardrobe 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DeWITT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Webster defines accessories as ``optional equipment,'' but he
obviously wasn't talking about fashion accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Try telling any fashion student those big gold hoops or slinky
shoulder dusters that are all the rage are optional equipment and,
well, they might grind their stiletto heel into your foot.
</P>
<P>
   Less emotional, but equally savvy, was the fictional sleuth
Sherlock Holmes, who observed that ``little things are infinitely
the most important.'' Although he probably wasn't talking about
which fashion accessories had the most elan (shoes, handbags,
jewels, hats or sunglasses), our trench-coated British gumshoe knew
the goods of good taste.
</P>
<P>
   Having accessories _ and the correct ones for each season _ is
so important that entire books are devoted to the details. For
instance, in ``Chic Simple Clothes'' (Alfred A. Knopf; $25) by Kim
Johnson Gross and Jeff Stone, there's a roundup of accessory
advice, but fashion maven Diana Vreeland leads with, ``First, I'd
put money into shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   And in ``Best Dressed'' (Clarkson Potter; $25), author Suzy
Gershman tells us that ``one hot accessory can make your ensemble
sing.'' She chats about the importance of an Hermes scarf, a pair
of real Chanel earrings and a pashmina stole, but then she gets to
the core of the accessory story: ``Forget (about the adage) you are
what you eat. In public, you are your handbag.''
</P>
<P>
   With advice like that, arm candy is turning into the most
important accessory of the season. Art in a bag is now big
business, with traditional companies often getting upstaged by
young new designers such as Lily Yudis. Her handmade retro-design
evening bags sporting the Lily Scott label have been spotted all
over Hollywood hanging on the arms of celebs such as Kirsten Dunst
and Jeri Ryan. Indeed, there are so many new designers in the purse
trade _ including Sharon Stone, who has a limited-edition
collection with Louis Vuitton to raise money for the American
Foundation for AIDS Research _ that the once-hot Kate Spade is
becoming lost in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   While purse shopping, don't rule out those ladylike bags by
established designers from Hermes to Christian Dior that link you
to !ital!old money, last forever and get you better restaurant
service. For more accessory instruction, rent a video of ``The
Talented Mr. Ripley'' and ``Evita,'' or buy a copy of ``French
Style'' (Express; $20) by Veronique Vienne, who advises readers on
how to carry a purse with panache by holding it tenderly and close
to your body as part of your outfit.
</P>
<P>
   While you're studying up on purses and such, make sure you match
the right accessories to the right look. You won't increase your
hipster quotient with '70s-inspired python print pants and a Lady
Di bag by Christian Dior. Instead, swing a chain-strapped baguette
style over your shoulder, tie on a lariat necklace (hotter than
``Sex and the City's'' name necklace) and add a pair of hoop
earrings. Then ground the look with boots, adding bonus points for
choosing red over black.
</P>
<P>
   For those classy '40s tweed suits that everybody's talking
about, you'll need pearls _ ropes and ropes of them a la Coco
Chanel. Plus a pile of gold jewelry (silver is looking tarnished
this year) on your wrists, and some peek-a-boo (open-toed) or
pointy-toed spectator pumps.
</P>
<P>
   For either of the season's freshest looks, rethink hosiery.
Naked legs and toe rings that required expertise with fake tanning
lotions are all passe in the first fall of Y2K. What's new again
are sheer black stockings, opaque tights in colors and prints,
small-scale (not the Halloween witch variety) fishnets and even
preppy plaid socks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, here in L.A., you'll need some new shades.
</P>
<P>
   As with the two directions of clothing _ ladylike and disco
queen _ there are two major shade trends. For traditional
trappings, think of small, refined glasses with narrow frames such
as Chanel's new style with interlocking gold C's, or go for big,
bold black plastic frames with equally status-focused logos on the
sides. In regard to the latter, eyewear designer Alain Mikli says,
``They create an allure of mystery. Jackie O would have approved.''
</P>
<P>
   Too hip for designer shades, but tired of retro cat's-eye
frames? Start focusing on another '70s fad _ the oversize, rimless
aviator in Crayola colors. And just for fun, add a little crystal
heart or star in the corner of one of the lenses like fashion
designer Kenneth Cole, who recently opened a boutique in Santa
Monica.
</P>
<P>
   And stay tuned.
</P>
<P>
   As the weather cools down (and you know it will), retailers will
be tempting you with fur scarves to tuck inside black leather
jackets. It's a look that should make last year's pashmina stole
look as dated as those crystal bead bracelets you just had to have
last summer.

CANDIDATES TURN TO THE ISSUES THEY HOPE WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For George W. Bush, the devil is in the details.
</P>
<P>
   No presidential candidate has heaped policy particulars and
precise plans on his opponent and American voters with the gusto of
Al Gore. Now Bush has started firing back with his own facts and
figures, and the race that many thought would be a personality
contest is turning into a clash of policy wonks.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the vice president offered up a 12-chapter, 191-page
budget document that was more than a manifesto of his
domestic-policy goals. It was a challenge for Bush to match him on
the details.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to guess at what the specifics are,'' Gore
said, using the words ``specific,'' ``detailed,'' and ``concrete''
nine times to describe his blueprint in a fact-filled speech at
Cleveland State University. ``You can read my plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Bush laid out the details of his $198 billion
initiative to overhaul the federal Medicare program and provide
seniors coverage for prescription drugs. Wednesday, in separate
campaign appearances, he repeated his plan for rebuilding the
military and outlined the specifics of his tax-cut proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters are demanding details,'' said Democratic pollster
Celinda Lake. ``They have a lot of issues on their minds. They
don't think we have made as much progress in the last eight years
as we should have, and they want these candidates to be very
specific about how they are going to move the ball forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Lake acknowledges that an issue-centered campaign gives Gore the
initial advantage. The vice president is a tireless and articulate
policy maven, plus polls show that voters give Democrats the edge
when asked which party they trust more to improve education,
enhance health care, and protect Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   For months Gore has needled Bush to get more specific on the
economic proposals he made during the GOP primaries. The more Bush
resisted and focused on issues of character and trust, the more
relentless Gore became in questioning both Bush's substance and the
risks of his unscrutinized plans. Gore also got a boost in the
polls after giving an acceptance speech heavy on issues at the
Democratic convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you've seen in the last week is the Bush campaign
realizing they have to come back on these issues because it was
starting to hurt them,'' said Thomas Patterson, Bradlee professor
of government and the press at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government. ``You can float above it for only so long. Once people
start asking, `where's the beef?' you have to give them some.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Bush supporters believe this is a good thing. Not only will
Bush rise to the challenge and show mastery of the issues, they
say, but he will also demonstrate that he will be a president of
vision and direction and a different kind of Republican, that is, a
compassionate conservative committed to getting jobs done in a
bipartisan way.
</P>
<P>
   In his Medicare speech in Allentown, Pa., on Tuesday, Bush
praised the Great Society program enacted by Democratic President
Lyndon B. Johnson as a success for seniors, and he spoke
specifically of how he could work with Democrats like Louisiana
Senator John Breaux to reshape it for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``By history and by choice, our nation makes a promise: We will
honor our fathers and mothers by providing quality health insurance
to every senior citizen,'' Bush said. ``Keeping the promise of
Medicare, and expanding it to include prescription drug coverage
will be a priority of my administration,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That speech gave a window on a Bush presidency,'' said Alvin
Felzenberg, a visiting scholar at the Heritage Foundation, a think
tank, who served in President Bush's administration. ``It showed
that he can be magnanimous, that he is a compassionate
conservative, that he has command of the issue, that he won't come
in and torch the programs people like, but he will end the
Washington food fight that people hate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It accomplished all of his goals,'' Felzenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   If the presidential campaign stays issue-driven for the next two
months _ and there is no guarantee of that _ it would present
voters with clear differences between the candidates. Bush is
highlighting his bold proposals _ privatizing a portion of Social
Security, returning part of the federal budget surplus in the form
of a tax cut, and giving seniors market choices in Medicare
coverage _ while Gore is offering himself as the steady hand, the
leader offering modest proposals that won't upset the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``My plan wasn't built on the cross-your-fingers economics that
says we can give more to the people who already have the most, and
then just hope the benefits trickle down to the middle class,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's budget blueprint, called ``Prosperity for America's
Families,'' was by far the most comprehensive package put forward
by any presidential candidate, analysts said. Most of its contents
were already known, however, including Gore's plans for reducing
the national debt, adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare,
and offering targeted tax cuts and savings incentives.
</P>
<P>
   When voters say they want campaigns to be about issues, what
they may really mean is that they don't like mudslinging and
negative ads in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans have always found politics distasteful, and it's
been a little worse lately,'' said Thomas Mann, director of
government studies at the Brookings Institution, a think tank. ``It
always seemed likely to me that efforts to make this campaign about
scandal and impeachment would fall flat if candidates elevated the
tone with a promise to talk about health care, education, and
Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, pollsters say, most Americans really don't pay that
much attention the details of the policies the candidates are now
so painstakingly putting forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the specifics of the Bush plan or the Gore plan
on Medicare are going to make a lot of people change their votes,''
said Steven Kull, director of the nonprofit Center on Public
Attitudes, which released a study last month showing the majority
of Americans wants government to make fundamental changes in the
health care system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters want to know the candidates have a plan, and they want
to know if other people they respect view it favorably,'' Kull
said. ``But I don't think they are going to read the fine print.''

FOO FIGHTERS STEPPED UP FOR LETTERMAN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: On David Letterman's comeback show after his heart surgery,
what musical group canceled a tour date to perform for him? Also,
what song did they play? _ U.C., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: At Letterman's request, the Foo Fighters showed up Feb. 21 to
perform ``Everlong'' from their second album, ``The Colour and the
Shape.''
</P>
<P>
   When introducing the song, Letterman said that it was ``my
favorite band playing my favorite song.'' He also held the group's
CD cover upside down, which he often does for bands that he likes.
</P>
<P>
   Windows users can see the performance on ``Nothing Left to
Lose,'' the Foo Fighters' current CD, which includes a multimedia
``ECD'' with several of the band's videos.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm trying to find a song I used to hear on jukeboxes when I
walked through the Fort Worth Stockyards in 1944. The only line I
remember is ``they took the stars out of heaven when they took you
from me.'' Can you help? _ J.G.S., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: That song is ``They Took the Stars Out of Heaven,'' recorded
by Floyd Tillman and the Texas Playboys.
</P>
<P>
   It is included on the 1994 three-album collection, ``From the
Vaults: Decca Country'' which also features ``The Eyes of Texas''
by Milton Brown and his Brownies, ``Cool Water'' by Sons of the
Pioneers and ``Walking the Floor Over You'' by Ernest Tubb.
</P>
<P>
   The album is still in print. If you can't find it at a local
store, you can order it for $38.97 from People's Tour by calling
(877) 362-8019 or visiting the Web site www.peoplestour.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a new marketing idea for the Joe Boxer Company. Where
can I write to the president? _ C.J., Arlington
</P>
<P>
   A: Send your letter to Chief Underpants Officer Nicholas Graham,
Joe Boxer Corp. World Headquarters, 1265 Folsom St., San Francisco,
CA 94103.
</P>
<P>
   That title is official, by the way. Graham, 40, began the
company in 1985 while working as a rock musician in San Francisco,
creating novelty ties and X-rated underwear. Today, Joe Boxer
products appear in more than 4,000 U.S. stores and have yearly
sales of more than $100 million. &QL;

 &HT;    Live, from Marietta, it's weather for Latin America
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Helena de Moura has just come off the air near the end
of a 10-hour shift of broadcasting the weather. As she makes her
way toward her desk she passes Vanessa Miranda, a fellow Brazilian
weather presenter, applying makeup in preparation for her own
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, Ricardo Nogueira, an on-air meteorologist,
arrives. He is carrying, as always, a carved gourd called a
``cuia''filled with something that looks, to North American eyes, a
bit like silage or something a cow might chew.
</P>
<P>
   But it's ``chimarrao,'' a tea common to southern Brazil, where
Nogueira grew up. He pours water into the leaf-filled ``cuia,''
lets it steep, then drinks the tea through a spoon-slash-straw that
has a strainer on the bottom to keep the leaves from being sipped
into his mouth. ``Chimarrao,'' Nogueira explains happily, has a
much higher caffeine content than coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by so many things Brazilian, it seems de Moura might
as well be back home.
</P>
<P>
   But this is Marietta, not Brazil, and de Moura works at the
Weather Channel Latin America, or TWCLA, as employees call it, a
sister company to the original Weather Channel. Both are owned by
Virginia-based Landmark Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The original Weather Channel _ a 24-hour all-weather cable
television channel that was launched, to some skepticism, 17 years
ago _ is by now familiar to many people in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Latin American version was launched three years ago, aimed
at the vast Spanish-speaking world between the tip of South America
and the Mexico-Texas border. That programming is now seen in 20
countries.
</P>
<P>
   And two years ago, a Portuguese language edition was started to
serve Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Those ventures have been propelled by about 70 employees, drawn
from diverse countries, working together at TWCLA's offices in
Marietta. The group, which includes people from Brazil, Colombia,
Mexico, Argentina, Cuba and Chile, has melded into a kind of
miniature Latin American society.
</P>
<P>
   The Latin American weather channel is doing very well, says
Eduardo Ruiz, its president. But in the beginning, the project
faced serious challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's very little education on meteorology in Latin
America,'' Ruiz says.
</P>
<P>
   Schoolchildren rarely come home discussing the difference
between cirrus clouds and cumulonimbus ones. Farmers have not
traditionally watched weather forecasts and made decisions
accordingly. City dwellers have not been in the habit of turning on
the TV in the morning to see whether to carry umbrellas.
</P>
<P>
   When TWCLA began, 90 percent of the programming was weather
forecasts and data and 10 percent was educational features, Ruiz
says. Now the split is closer to 50-50, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest obstacle is that we're trying to develop a new
habit in consumers,'' he says. ``We're doing it, little by
little.''
</P>
<P>
   An important ingredient in gaining acceptance, he says, is to
have Latin Americans on the air.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that last month, when serious flooding hit
northeastern Brazil, residents of the area were able to watch de
Moura telling them what was likely to happen next.
</P>
<P>
   The programming they watched from Marietta had an even more
local flavor than they might have gotten out of Rio de Janeiro. De
Moura is from Recife, a coastal city in northeastern Brazil, the
area affected by the floods. Much as a Southern drawl might be a
hindrance for someone seeking on-air TV work in the United States,
de Moura says her regional accent would probably preclude her from
getting a television job in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   But here it's an advantage, says Eduardo Mack, program manager
of the Weather Channel/Brazil, and a native of Rio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want this to be a truly Brazilian network,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   TWCLA's employees may have fused into a little Latin American
society, but language is a significant issue in a company where, by
Mack's count, five different ones are spoken. Employees in these
Marietta offices, he says, speak English, Spanish, Portuguese and
two hybrids _ Spanglish and Portunol.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of room for miscommunication,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Many employees are hired directly from their native countries,
like Luis Carrera, who was a television meteorologist in Chile
until he got an improbable phone call asking whether he'd like a
job in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   But de Moura, 33, a graduate of the University of Georgia, has
lived in the metro area for many years. She worked off and on for
five years at CNN as an assignment editor and producer and wrote
for the Reuters news serviced before Mack called asking if she'd
like an on-air job.
</P>
<P>
   She had to begin an intensive study of weather, a topic about
which she had scant prior knowledge. While she consults the
meteorologists who analyze the information collected at hundreds of
sites in Brazil, she doesn't read a script on the air. She ad libs.
She has to know her stuff.
</P>
<P>
   TWCLA has, at the moment, only one satellite feed. In Brazil,
computers interrupt the feed and show local weather graphics as a
five-minute Spanish segment airs in the rest of Latin America. Then
viewers in the Spanish-speaking countries watch graphics while de
Moura, or another Brazilian personality, presents 2 1/2 minutes of
weather in Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for growth in Latin America is enormous, says
Ruiz, and the company is also seeking ways to tap into the growing
Spanish-speaking market in the United States. TWCLA is available in
the United States through DirecTV Para Todos, which offers
Spanish-language programming via satellite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our forecast is clear and we have good weather ahead of us,''
Ruiz says.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast for de Moura looks good, too. Several Brazilian
newspapers have written about her. She receives e-mails from
Brazil, though often they are from long-lost cousins saying things
like, ``You need to do something about your hair.''
</P>
<P>
   She's learning more about Brazil and its topography than she
ever knew when she lived there. And she is becoming friends with
people from different parts of that vast country _ Brazil is larger
than the continental United States _ and learning more about
Brazil's many different cultures than she knew when shelived in
Recife.
</P>
<P>
   And, after 16 years in Georgia, she feels that, on Interstate
North Parkway in Marietta, she has in a way finally returned home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find a camaraderie here,'' she says, ``that I had longed
for.''

SEVERAL GUESSES ABOUT 7UP
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ What does the 7 in 7UP stand for? _ L.A., Chicago
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ There are several theories about why drink inventor
Charles Grigg chose the name 7UP, but the most likely is that it
was inspired by a cattle brand, according to Jeffrey L. Rodengen,
author of the book ``The Legend of Dr Pepper/Seven-Up.''
</P>
<P>
   Other possibilities: He named it after a winning roll in a dice
game, after the drink's 7-ounce bottles or after a belief that
``his new drink would cure mankind's seven hangovers,'' Rodengen
said. ``Grigg never explained exactly why he came up with the
name.''
</P>
<P>
   When the drink debuted in 1929 a few weeks before the stock
market crash, it was called Bib-Label Lithiated Lemon-Lime Soda. It
was quickly renamed.
</P>

<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ What year was the children's show ``Shenanigans'' on
TV, and who appeared on it? _ C.S., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ ``Shenanigans,'' a game show in which two children
competed on a life-size Milton Bradley game board, aired from 1964
to 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway performer Stubby Kaye hosted the show and announcer
Kenny Williams appeared as Kenny the Cop. Many stunts that children
performed to win prizes were based on Milton Bradley games such as
Time Bomb and Operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money was given out as Shenanaganzas, which were redeemable
later as trading stamps like you got at the grocery store,'' the
Web site TV Party.Com states. ``The commercials are all for Milton
Bradley products as well, which proves that Saturday morning toy
tie-ins go back a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   TV Party publishes a short video clip from ``Shenanigans'' on
its Web site at tvparty.com/lostshenanigans.html.

<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ Where can I write to Ray Romano? _ U.C., via the
Internet
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ Write to him in care of William Morris Agency, 151 El
Camino Drive, Beverly Hills, CA 90212.
</P>
<P>
   The 42-year-old actor and comedian is up for three Emmy Awards
this year, including a nomination for Lead Actor in a Comedy
Series. The ceremony will air at 7 p.m. Sunday on ABC.

SINGER-ACTOR BILL HENDERSON FINDS NEW AUDIENC
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While casting their strangely titled but exquisitely affecting
new movie, ``Smiling Fish and Goat on Fire,'' writers Derick and
Steven Martini and director Kevin Jordan must have looked at a
hundred old men for the role of Clive Winters, the character Derick
describes as ``the movie's heart and soul, the Yoda of love.''
</P>
<P>
   Problem was, every actor who read for the part was too bitter
and set in his ways, according to the filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw dozens of variations of the grumpy old man,'' Derick
says. ``We were pretty much ready to write the character out of the
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   And then Bill Henderson walked in the door. And it was, director
Jordan says, a happy accident, like striking gold in the middle of
the La Brea Tar Pits.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson has that effect on people. And at age 74, the likeable
character actor and sublime singer is undergoing a renaissance in
both careers. His role in ``Smiling Fish'' (currently playing to
great success in four Los Angeles theaters) has won Henderson
standing ovations at film festivals and a recognition that has
largely eluded him in his 25-year career as an actor. And thanks to
local jazz legend Charlie Haden, music lovers are again discovering
Henderson's smoky baritone through a concert tour behind Haden's
acclaimed Quartet West album, ``The Art of the Song.''
</P>
<P>
   For Henderson, the recognition is proof that ``if you keep doing
what you like to do, something good might happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And if it doesn't,'' he says, ``it's not because you didn't
work at it. Would I like to be more successful? Yes. But that's not
the thing, man. I'm still alive. I have no hard feelings. That's
not my style.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson has always belonged to the less-is-more school of both
singing and acting. (The two disciplines, for him, feed each
other.) The Chicago native believes that the story _ be it a song's
lyrics or a screenplay's dialogue _ should be front and center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The words are important to me because I was a middle child,
and most times, middle children are not heard from,'' Henderson
says. ``So I learned from an early age to enunciate clearly in
order to be heard and so as not to be misunderstood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides,'' he adds, ``I've just always had a thing for
words.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson made his name among jazz aficionados in the 1950s and
'60s, recording with the likes of pianists Oscar Peterson and
Horace Silver, organist Jimmy Smith and Count Basie's orchestra.
Henderson toured with Basie from 1965 to 1966, replacing the late
great Joe Williams, and impressed masters like Frank Sinatra with
his phrasing, sensitivity and the unguarded way he approached
heart-breaking ballads like ``It Never Entered My Mind'' and ``My
Funny Valentine.''
</P>
<P>
   But Henderson never achieved any sustained mass popularity and
when the clubs and paychecks both started becoming smaller,
Henderson found himself drifting into acting. The career change
came gradually and with the help of friend Bill Cosby, whom
Henderson had met while they were both performing in New York
clubs. Henderson first became Cosby's stand-in (lifts were
required, as the 5-foot-6 Henderson measures about half a foot
shorter than Cosby) and then appeared in one of the comedian's
early comedy shows.
</P>
<P>
   None of the filmmakers responsible for ``Smiling Fish and Goat
on Fire'' knew any of this when they met Henderson in a casting
session. Director Jordan and Steven Martini are 25; Derick is two
years younger. But they could tell right away that Henderson's
wisdom was hard-won and authentic, perfect for a character who
counsels the movie's young folks in the ways of love.
</P>
<P>
   So the Martinis rewrote the part to fit an African-American
actor. And once they began filming the $40,000 feature, the
screenwriters quickly realized that their script was merely a
starting point for Henderson.
</P>

   ``Bill is an inspiration for a writer,'' Derick says. ``Once you
meet him, he's got so much energy and talent that you want to
create more for him to do. So we did, and then when we starting
shooting the movie, we realized that he had tremendous
improvisational skills as well. So we just let him go and he
created all these wonderful lines that we started calling
'Hendersonisms' because they're the kinds of things that only Bill
could say.''
</P>
<P>
   It all goes back to Henderson's love for words and a style that
the great jazz producer Orrin Keepnews describes as a ``cross
between a matinee idol and a pixie, with an off-kilter romanticism
all his own.'' Haden had wanted to put that style to use for years
and approached Henderson every so often to tell him that he had
``something in mind'' for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like a guy coming out of the mist,'' Henderson says.
``You know, people tell you they want to work with you all the
time. Even Duke Ellington said that: 'Bill Henderson. Where is he?
How can I get a hold of him?' And you get excited and then you
never hear from them. But Charlie kept at me and one day he said,
'I finally have what it is.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Haden album, ``The Art of the Song,'' features Henderson and
Shirley Horn (another undervalued talent) singing lushly arranged
songs culled mostly from movies dating back to the 1930s, '40s and
'50s. Henderson has been touring with Haden on and off for the past
year, with Horn joining them on selected dates. The last scheduled
show of the tour is a concert at UCLA's Royce Hall on Sept. 21.
(Horn will participate, too.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I was becoming very disgusted with recordings and the things
people wanted me to sing,'' Henderson says. ``It wasn't me. And
it's very difficult to sing something that you don't have your
heart in. So I was determined not to do anything unless I could
sink my teeth into it. And Charlie gave me that chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Although pleased with his new-found notoriety, the affable
Henderson is maintaining a typical even keel, neither thinking that
people are going to be busting down his door with offers or
believing that life is going to hand him another kick in the pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping some of the things I've auditioned for are going to
come through,'' Henderson says. ``But if they don't, I'll keep
going. There's always something good that's going to happen for
Bill Henderson around the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   And if it's good for Bill Henderson, it's usually good for us,
too. &QL;

SINGER-ACTOR BILL HENDERSON FINDS NEW AUDIENC
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While casting their strangely titled but exquisitely affecting
new movie, ``Smiling Fish and Goat on Fire,'' writers Derick and
Steven Martini and director Kevin Jordan must have looked at a
hundred old men for the role of Clive Winters, the character Derick
describes as ``the movie's heart and soul, the Yoda of love.''
</P>
<P>
   Problem was, every actor who read for the part was too bitter
and set in his ways, according to the filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw dozens of variations of the grumpy old man,'' Derick
says. ``We were pretty much ready to write the character out of the
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   And then Bill Henderson walked in the door. And it was, director
Jordan says, a happy accident, like striking gold in the middle of
the La Brea Tar Pits.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson has that effect on people. And at age 74, the likeable
character actor and sublime singer is undergoing a renaissance in
both careers. His role in ``Smiling Fish'' (currently playing to
great success in four Los Angeles theaters) has won Henderson
standing ovations at film festivals and a recognition that has
largely eluded him in his 25-year career as an actor. And thanks to
local jazz legend Charlie Haden, music lovers are again discovering
Henderson's smoky baritone through a concert tour behind Haden's
acclaimed Quartet West album, ``The Art of the Song.''
</P>
<P>
   For Henderson, the recognition is proof that ``if you keep doing
what you like to do, something good might happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And if it doesn't,'' he says, ``it's not because you didn't
work at it. Would I like to be more successful? Yes. But that's not
the thing, man. I'm still alive. I have no hard feelings. That's
not my style.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson has always belonged to the less-is-more school of both
singing and acting. (The two disciplines, for him, feed each
other.) The Chicago native believes that the story _ be it a song's
lyrics or a screenplay's dialogue _ should be front and center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The words are important to me because I was a middle child,
and most times, middle children are not heard from,'' Henderson
says. ``So I learned from an early age to enunciate clearly in
order to be heard and so as not to be misunderstood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides,'' he adds, ``I've just always had a thing for
words.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson made his name among jazz aficionados in the 1950s and
'60s, recording with the likes of pianists Oscar Peterson and
Horace Silver, organist Jimmy Smith and Count Basie's orchestra.
Henderson toured with Basie from 1965 to 1966, replacing the late
great Joe Williams, and impressed masters like Frank Sinatra with
his phrasing, sensitivity and the unguarded way he approached
heart-breaking ballads like ``It Never Entered My Mind'' and ``My
Funny Valentine.''
</P>
<P>
   But Henderson never achieved any sustained mass popularity and
when the clubs and paychecks both started becoming smaller,
Henderson found himself drifting into acting. The career change
came gradually and with the help of friend Bill Cosby, whom
Henderson had met while they were both performing in New York
clubs. Henderson first became Cosby's stand-in (lifts were
required, as the 5-foot-6 Henderson measures about half a foot
shorter than Cosby) and then appeared in one of the comedian's
early comedy shows.
</P>
<P>
   None of the filmmakers responsible for ``Smiling Fish and Goat
on Fire'' knew any of this when they met Henderson in a casting
session. Director Jordan and Steven Martini are 25; Derick is two
years younger. But they could tell right away that Henderson's
wisdom was hard-won and authentic, perfect for a character who
counsels the movie's young folks in the ways of love.
</P>
<P>
   So the Martinis rewrote the part to fit an African-American
actor. And once they began filming the $40,000 feature, the
screenwriters quickly realized that their script was merely a
starting point for Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill is an inspiration for a writer,'' Derick says. ``Once you
meet him, he's got so much energy and talent that you want to
create more for him to do. So we did, and then when we starting
shooting the movie, we realized that he had tremendous
improvisational skills as well. So we just let him go and he
created all these wonderful lines that we started calling
'Hendersonisms' because they're the kinds of things that only Bill
could say.''
</P>
<P>
   It all goes back to Henderson's love for words and a style that
the great jazz producer Orrin Keepnews describes as a ``cross
between a matinee idol and a pixie, with an off-kilter romanticism
all his own.'' Haden had wanted to put that style to use for years
and approached Henderson every so often to tell him that he had
``something in mind'' for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like a guy coming out of the mist,'' Henderson says.
``You know, people tell you they want to work with you all the

How can I get a hold of him?' And you get excited and then you
never hear from them. But Charlie kept at me and one day he said,
'I finally have what it is.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Haden album, ``The Art of the Song,'' features Henderson and
Shirley Horn (another undervalued talent) singing lushly arranged

SHOOT-'EM-UP GOES TOO FAR
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
-Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christopher McQuarrie, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of ``The
Usual Suspects,'' proves he knows how to handle cameras, actors and
violent action with his directing debut, ``The Way of the Gun.''
Care has evidently been lavished on the film's every line
(McQuarrie also wrote the script), composition, performance and
bullet squib.
</P>
<P>
   Why so much talent was spent on a project as distasteful as this
one is another matter. McQuarrie has stated that he wanted to
subvert Hollywood's standard, simplistic moralism with this film.
Rather than stack the deck against bad guys in order to justify
their extended punishment, he figured making all of his characters
ethically repugnant in one way or another would challenge audience
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Like this is anything new. Hitchcock began experimenting with
viewer sympathies back in the '20s, and a hundred or so
post-Tarantino crime films _ ``Suspects'' included _ have made a
fetish out of the practice for the last half a decade.
</P>
<P>
   McQuarrie comes up with some interesting variations on the
notion here, no question (an unmourned innocent bystander left
lying after a parking lot shootout, for example). But he also goes
so far with it, culminating in an astonishingly brutal, extended
climax that has to rank as one of the great audience endurance
tests of all time, that his smarter ideas will likely be
bloodwashed from most filmgoers' memories.
</P>
<P>
   The plot is the old kidnapping-gone-wrong ploy _ but, boy, what
a messy one this is. Two not-so-bright criminal drifters, Parker (a
beefed-up, brooded-over Ryan Phillippe) and Longbaugh
(``Suspects''' Benicio Del Toro, inscrutably cooler than ever),
cook up a cockeyed plan to ransom a surrogate mother (Juliette
Lewis). (The last names of the characters were inspired by the
real-life monickers of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.) Little
do these two know that the young woman's wealthy womb-renters are
deeply involved with the mob.
</P>
<P>
   As Parker, Longbaugh and Lewis' verging-on-delivery Robin scoot
around the desert Southwest and across the Mexican border, several
factions of enforcers, each with their own agendas, dog their tail.
Will the humiliated, untrustworthy bodyguards Jeffers and Obecks
(Taye Diggs and Nicky Katt) find the fleeing trio before veteran
bagman Joe Sarno (James Caan), who has his own conflicted
loyalties, cuts a deal? And where do the Mexican police, Robin's
overly concerned obstetrician (Dylan Kussman) and a suicidal
assassin (Geoffrey Lewis, Juliette's real-life father, in a
terrific small bit on a par with the best Sam Peckinpah and Don
Siegel criminal losers of the '70s) fit in?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, what effect will Robin, whose motives emerge as
increasingly complex while the chase progresses, have on the deeply
buried consciences of (and bond of trust between) Parker and
Longbaugh?
</P>
<P>
   Any one of these intricate storylines would have been
fascinating to follow, had its narrative and behavioral
implications been played out fully. Instead, everything just kind
of collapses into one of the most intensely ballistic desert
shootouts ever filmed (and certainly the first one _ spoiler
warning here, for those who prefer to be surprised rather than
unnecessarily disgusted _ juxtaposed against a torturous induced
labor).
</P>
<P>
   There you have it. If this sounds at all interesting to you, you
can be assured that ``Way of the Gun'' presents it all pretty well.
The bigger concern, however, should be why you might possibly be
interested. &QL;

ANALYSIS: GORE REVIVES DEBATE OVER BASIC ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (With GORE-ECON, BUSH) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In releasing a detailed economic blueprint
Wednesday, Vice President Al Gore reignited a debate with Gov.
George W. Bush about who can better apportion the projected federal
budget surplus without driving the government back into the red and
running the good economy off the rails.
</P>
<P>
   By making selective assumptions about which tax and spending
proposals to include and how to put a pricetag on them, both
presidential campaigns can produce bottom lines suggesting that
theirs is the path of fiscal prudence and their opponent's the
first step toward economic ruin.
</P>
<P>
   The money the two sides are planning is only hypothetical at
this point, and for all the numbers flying back and forth, the
issue is not really arithmetic. What matters is the clear
difference in approach to economic management and use of the
surplus between the two parties and their candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush for the most part represents conservative orthodoxy, with a
heavy emphasis on tax cuts, keeping politicians from getting their
hands on too much money and relying on individuals and markets to
solve problems and strengthen the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In his view, tax cuts are a powerful way to improve the chance
that the the economy will continue to grow over the long term.
Reducing the national debt, while an important goal, is not a
singular priority.
</P>
<P>
   After spending much of the past several months campaigning as a
corporation-bashing populist fighting for working families, Gore
presented himself Wednesday as the embodiment of fiscal
responsibility, brushing aside the Bush camp's accusations that he
is a recklessly big-spending liberal.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized his willingness to take some money out of
contention for either tax cuts or additional spending, vowing to
set aside $300 billion of the projected surplus over the next ten
years in case the economic assumptions that produce the estimates
of the coming surplus prove to be wrong. If the money materializes,
it would go to additional debt reduction; if it does not, then it
would not have been promised for any particular use and thus would
not be contributing to any new deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The 191-page document released Wednesday by Gore was written
largely by economic advisers closely associated with the Clinton
administration's emphasis on keeping the budget balanced and paying
off the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   They included former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, , who
colleagues said has sometimes been uncomfortable with Gore's recent
populist emphasis; Gene Sperling, the White House economic policy
adviser; Erskine Bowles, the former White House chief of staff; and
Laura Tyson, a former White House chief economist and policy
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Those advisers generally see the strong economy as Gore's best
weapon, and reducing the debt as the best way of keeping interest
rates low and stimulating the investment the economy needs to
remain the world's most competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as he presented himself as a man of economic prudence,
Gore sketched a vision of an activist government willing to take on
big problems. The document he released Wednesday sought to spell
out for voters, with considerable specificity, how Gore would seek
to harness continued prosperity on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Incomes would rise by a third, Gore promised. The poverty level
would decline from 12.7 percent to below 10 percent. College
attendance and graduation rates would increase. Income tax rates on
families making the median income would fall. The disparity between
what men and women earn would be reduced by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore described not just the goals, but the programs and policies
he said would be necessary to achieve them, from paying off the
national debt to spending $115 billion more on education in the
next decade and establishing a new retirement savings program at a
cost of at least $200 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the goals are achievable is largely a matter of how well
the economy does in coming years, a variable mostly outside the
control of any president.
</P>
<P>
   The current business expansion is already the longest the nation
has ever enjoyed. Should the combination of healthy growth, low
unemployment and higher productivity continue for another eight
years _ by no means a certainty, even if the president, Congress
and the Federal Reserve make all the right choices _ many if not
all of Gore's goals could be within reach.
</P>
<P>
   Should the economy hit the rocks, they could come back to haunt
a President Gore.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The entire exercise was striking for the degree of detail it
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, Bill Clinton offered an economic policy agenda
entitled ``Putting People First.'' It was praised if nothing else
for being detailed and concrete about his plans and priorities. In
its original form, it was a few dozen pages long, an airy pamphlet
alongside Gore's chart-laden presentation.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not pulled his proposals together in a comprehensive
document. But his campaign put out a detailed accounting of his tax
and spending plans Wednesday, right down to his proposed spending
increase for aid to historically black colleges and universities
($900 million over ten years).
</P>
<P>
   Bush counterpunched hard, citing support for his approach from
conservative Nobel prize-winning economists like Milton Friedman,
and asserting that Gore's long list of initiatives would blow a
hole in the budget.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's camp is happy to have the campaign fought over
economic management issues, seeing that as ground on which Gore is
both comfortable and right.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear how much credit voters will give to the vice
president for the current prosperity _ whether, as is traditionally
the case, the good times will lead voters to think hard before
throwing the incumbent party out of the White House.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gore left little doubt about how he wants to put prosperity to
work, but some of his more ambitious goals were vaguely defined.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would seek to create 10 million new ``high-tech,
high-skill'' jobs during the next decade. But he did not define how
those jobs would differ from other jobs, or how much better paying
they would presumably be than flipping hamburgers. And his
prescription for creating them encompassed such broad initiatives
as improving education and training and continuing to open new
foreign markets to American goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would work to raise family incomes by one-third over
10 years, largely by fostering continued improvement in the growth
rate of productivity, the basic measure of economic efficiency. As
productivity increases, wages and profits can rise without setting
off inflation, and much of the economy's recent strength can be
traced to productivity improvements.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no simple recipe for nurturing productivity.
Productivity dropped sharply in the early 1970s for reasons that
economists still do not fully understand, and has only rebounded in
the past few years. The spread of computers and other information
technology has obviously played a role, but no one knows for sure
how long the improvement will last.

 &HT;    IRS restructuring to bring new division to Atlanta
 &HT;    By Peralte C. Paul
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Get ready for a kinder, gentler IRS. Yes, that IRS.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the federal agency's 1998 restructuring to take
consumer confusion out of tax collection, the IRS set up four
operating divisions to specialize in a particular tax area.
</P>
<P>
   The wage and investment operating division, charged with
handling individual taxpayer returns, will be based in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The wage and investment division will begin operations Oct. 1 in
the Peachtree Summit Building downtown, said John Dalrymple, the
division's commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   The unit will hire several hundred employees and will be
operational by May 2001, he said. The agency already has hired 100
people to staff the division.
</P>
<P>
   The division will handle $380 billion of the $1.8 trillion in
taxes the IRS collects each year.
</P>
<P>
   The three other divisions, based in Washington for now, will
handle returns for mid- and large-sized businesses, tax exempt
organizations and government entities, and small
business/self-employed operators.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the old system, which was geographically based with 33
districts nationwide, the new approach is meant to make the IRS
more customer-friendly, Dalrymple said.
</P>
<P>
   Local tax preparers and certified public accountants said the
IRS' step toward specialization is a logical move. ``The tax code
is so broad and so complicated, they need to break it down into
smaller segments,'' said Ken Weatherwax, owner of Weatherwax &AMP;
Associates, a tax public accounting firm in Norcross.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring will make it easier for taxpayers to navigate
the agency, said one former IRS agent. ``It's easier, yes, but the
people who want to cheat are getting away with murder,'' said
Lawrence L. Denney, an IRS agent for eight years before starting
his Atlanta-based public accounting firm in 1983. The IRS has been
lax on filing levies and seizures on evaders since the Tax Reform
Act of 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wonderful time for people who don't want to pay
taxes,'' he said, adding about 20 percent of Americans don't file
or pay taxes.

<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Russia's space agency is once again
scraping for the scarce government funds it needs to keep the
international space station supplied with fuel and the other
supplies next year, a top official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   More funding will be needed soon if Russia's contractors are to

half-dozen Progress cargo and two Soyuz crew capsules to the slowly
developing orbital outpost during 2001, according to Mikhail
Sinelshikov, chief of piloted programs for the Russian Aviation and

<P>
   ``This is an ugly process actually,'' said Sinelshikov, who is
at NASA's Kennedy Space Center this week for the launching of the
U.S. shuttle Atlantis on a supply mission to the station. ``It's a
very difficult, cumbersome, unpleasant process of dealing with the
ministry of finance and actually forcefully getting the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinelshikov was hopeful the prime minister, Parliament and
finance ministry can free up the Russian equivalent of $54 million
by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Russia successfully launched the station's Zvezda
module, a 43-foot-long compartment that equipped the station with
living and working quarters for three. The addition will make it
possible for astronauts and cosmonauts to begin a decade-long
occupancy of the outpost in early November.
</P>
<P>
   Stalled more than two years by Russian economic problems, the
Zvezda module represents the first of that country's major
contributions to an unprecedented assembly effort involving 16
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's other major contribution is a steady supply of Progress
and Soyuz capsules. The Progress will furnish the fuel that is
necessary to keep the outpost circling the Earth at a safe
altitude. The Soyuz capsules will park at the station for six
months at a time, serving as lifeboats for residents of the
outpost, a means of returning quickly to Earth in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians offered assurances they will have no difficulty
launching a Soyuz with the station's first resident crew, American
Bill Shepherd and cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei Krikalev on
Oct. 30 nor the three Progress capsules pledged for the remainder
of this year.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 rockets are in various stages of assembly at RSC
Energia, the Russian agency's spacecraft contractor, plenty of
hardware to meet the station's future Soyuz and Progress needs if
only the funds arrive to finish the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to make sure we are on our way next year,'' said
Sinelshikov. ``We need to do some important work right now to be
sure we will be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   As the project's managing partner, NASA is planning three
shuttle station supply and assembly missions this year and six in
2001, a pace that will greatly enhance the size and capability of
the new station.
</P>
<P>
   However, the U.S. space agency is closely monitoring Russian
spacecraft production and developing options to make up for lapses
in the Progress missions where it can.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians are very financially strapped. They don't have as
much money as they and I would like them to have,'' said Tommy
Holloway, NASA's space station program manager. ``They are very
resourceful. We will watch and wait.''
</P>
<P>
   One option is to dedicate the Progress craft that are available
to fuel transport. The food, spare parts, clothing and other dry
cargo would instead be delivered aboard U.S. shuttles, said Bob
Cabana, NASA's manager of international operations for the station.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
efforts to prepare Atlantis for a Friday liftoff were interrupted
for several hours by a lightning strike on the shuttle's coastal
launching pad.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantis was undamaged by the strike. The shuttle was shielded
by an elaborate protection system that includes a 100-foot tall
lightning rod that rises above the launch pad and a network of
conductive cabling that grounded the surge.
</P>
<P>
   After the strike late Tuesday, engineers examined launch pad
sensors and reviewed a record of electrical activity aboard
Atlantis before concluding the shuttle was unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't see anything that concerns us at all,'' said Dave
King, NASA's shuttle launch director.
</P>
<P>
   However, the recovery activities placed ground crews several
hours behind schedule on Wednesday as they readied the shuttle's
electrical power generation system for an 11-day flight. Atlantis
is scheduled to blast off at at 7:45 a.m. CDT, Friday.
</P>
<P>
   King said that all countdown activities would be back on
schedule by early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After docking with the station, the shuttle crew plans to unload
about 5,000 pounds of equipment, some carried into orbit by
Atlantis and some already awaiting the astronauts in a Progress
capsule that linked with the outpost in early August.
</P>
<P>
   The cargo includes equipment that recycles breathing air, a
toilet and exercise gear. The fliers will prepare the systems for
the arrival of Shepherd's crew.

 &HT;    Prosecutors may indict Waters in O'Hair case
 &HT;    By Andrea Ball
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Five years after atheist leader Madalyn O'Hair
and two relatives vanished in a suspected kidnapping and murder
plot, federal prosecutors are going after the man they say
masterminded everything _ David Roland Waters.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office plans to seek an indictment against
Waters, 53, in the 1995 disappearance of O'Hair, her son Jon Garth
Murray and granddaughter Robin Murray-O'Hair, whom she adopted as
her daughter. The case could be presented to the grand jury within
the next month.
</P>
<P>
   Sources involved in the investigation refused to speak publicly
about Waters, who is serving a 60-year prison sentence. But several
said plans to pursue Waters are motivated by two factors: fear that
Waters could be released from prison and a rapidly approaching
deadline for the statute of limitations.
</P>
<P>
   If indicted, Waters would be the second man charged in the
O'Hair family's disappearance. Last month, alleged accomplice Gary
Paul Karr was sentenced to life in prison after a jury convicted
him of crimes including extortion and transporting stolen goods. He
was acquitted of a kidnapping charge.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have not rushed to indict Waters because he is
already in state prison. The Illinois native, who pleaded guilty in
1995 to stealing $54,000 from O'Hair's atheist organization, is
serving 60 years for violating his probation in that theft. He also
must serve a separate eight-year federal sentence on unrelated gun
charges.
</P>
<P>
   But Waters' time in prison could be shorter than expected.
</P>
<P>
   As new projections show Texas prisons could be filled to
capacity in one year, parole officials are considering policy
changes that could allow more nonviolent offenders to be released.
Although convicted in other states of murder and assault, Waters
has no violent offense on his Texas criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators worry that Waters, eligible for parole in 2006,
could be released early to serve his federal time, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not he would be paroled that early would be up to
the parole board, but their record shows that criminals of this
nature are rarely being given parole before their scheduled release
date,'' said Larry Todd, spokesman for the Texas Department of
Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Garrett, chairman of the Texas Board of Pardons and
Paroles, said that he did not know whether Waters would be a likely
candidate for parole but that Waters would be considered like
anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be irresponsible of me to speculate on the outcome of
a particular person's parole without knowing the facts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another motivating factor in the potential indictment is time.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have until October _ when the five-year statute of
limitations expires _ to file charges in the O'Hair family's
disappearance that don't carry the death penalty, such as
kidnapping and transporting stolen property. After that, federal
prosecutors have only one basic option: murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   Without bodies, eyewitnesses or strong physical evidence,
prosecutors acknowledge murder charges would be hard to prove.
</P>
<P>
   But the kidnapping charge is another story. Jurors in the Karr
case resoundingly agreed that, had Waters been on trial, they would
have convicted him on all counts. Jury foreman Hector Rodriguez
said he expected a new jury would come to the same conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the very strong evidence in the case was about Mr.
Waters,'' Rodriguez said. ``The prosecution portrayed him as an
evil man capable of these sorts of things. ... I couldn't imagine
that any reasonable juror could move to acquit him based on that
evidence.''

 &HT;    UT 'sick out' pretty anemic, observers say
 &HT;    By Ben Wear and Sharon Jayson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The burnt-orange flu at the University of Texas
Wednesday was more like a case of the hiccups.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the thousands of absent staff employees predicted by
the University Staff Association, which organized what is supposed
to be a three-day work stoppage, participation appeared to be in
the dozens or low hundreds. The group put the number higher, saying
that based on visits to some campus offices and extrapolations
1,300 and 1,800 of UT-Austin's 7,900 classified staff workers
stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever the actual figure lies, campus officials said the
missing employees failed to even partially disrupt operations.
Aside from a noon protest attended by perhaps 300 students and
employees and some classes held outdoors in support of the sickout,
Wednesday looked like business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the association, which has organized events since
1997 to protest salary and other issues, said they hoped for more
employees to stay home. The association's president, Peg Kramer,
had estimated that up to 7,000 would call in sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to escalate things,'' Kramer said. ``The focus
should be on the fact that the university hasn't addressed one
issue on the list of 17 demands. And that university employees are
so afraid of their employer that they're afraid to participate in a
job action.''
</P>
<P>
   Average pay for support staff at UT has increased 21 percent in
three years. But it still lags behind other Austin salaries, and
insurance changes this spring increased premiums for most
employees. University President Larry Faulkner said he will
continue to make raising staff pay a priority and that answers to
other issues are in the works. UT has already announced it will
create a staff advisory council, with members elected by classified
staff workers. And Faulkner said he will announce a new, more
arms-length grievance procedure for staff members ``pretty soon.''
</P>
<P>
   As for those who participated in the sickout, Faulkner said
punishment, if any, will be up to supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not going to be any witch-hunt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While UT officials did not have comprehensive numbers on
absentees, they did have some indications there was little
participation. Physical Plant _ the section of UT whose 1,000 or so
workers keep the campus buildings clean and machinery humming _ had
eight absences on the day shift, said Kyle Cavanaugh, UT's
associate vice president for human resources. That number, however,
stood to grow, he said, as night-time shifts begin. He said four of
several hundred Food and Housing employees were missing.
</P>
<P>
   Student Financial Services, with about 55 staff members, was at
100 percent on Wednesday, said Director Larry Burt. At the
University's Health Services Department, medical director Dr.
Theresa Spaldingsaid three people of about 160 called in ill. Ten
to 12 of the College of Liberal Arts' 287 staff employees were out,
Cavanaugh said. And at the School of Social Work, where Kramer
works as a graduate adviser, nine of 13 staff employees were at
work. Kramer was among the missing. .
</P>
<P>
   It was a normal Wednesday at the Perry-Castaneda Library, said
Robert Clontz, a part-time staffer who works at the circulation
desk. ``I haven't heard much talk within the library about joining
the walkout,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among students, few were well-versed on UT staff complaints or
the sickout But some, such as junior Janis Gorton, wore ``Students
Support Staff'' stickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I signed the petition and we've talked about it in class,''
she said. ``I don't know if it's the best way, but I think maybe
right now it's the best action because the university isn't really
listening to what they're saying.''

THE POWER OF COOKING IN THE MOVIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 10) 
 By KRISTIN HOHENADEL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the scentless, flavorless language of film, the dinner table
is often used as an excuse to assemble the cast: It becomes the
stage for spilling secrets, for acting out ancient dramas and
measuring loyalties by shifts in appetite. Take the ritual Sunday
dinners in Ang Lee's ``Eat Drink Man Woman'' (1994), or the
freighted family gatherings in the films of Woody Allen. ``What's
Cooking?,'' one of four food-centered movies coming this fall,
tells its story of multicultural Los Angeles through four
intersecting Thanksgiving feasts, their changing turkey recipes a
metaphor for families struggling not to break apart.
</P>
<P>
   Some film meals tip lovers into bed, and the food scenes can be
as titillating or as unintentionally hilarious as the sex scenes:
People biting into things, licking their lips, heads tilted back
and eyes closed in simulated bliss. There was the creative use of
honey in ``9{ Weeks'' (1986); there were lovers slipping a raw
unbroken egg yolk back and forth by mouth in ``Tampopo'' (1986);
dinner as foreplay in ``Tom Jones'' (1963), Albert Finney's Tom
shamelessly ravaging turkey legs and oranges opposite his next
conquest; and Jennifer Beals sucking on lobster claws in
``Flashdance'' (1983).
</P>
<P>
   But still other films explore the power of a meal to alter the
course of histories big and small. This fall a 17th-century chef, a
1950s shop owner and a contemporary Brazilian immigrant find their
destinies in their kitchens: In Roland Joffe's ``Vatel,'' opening
on Christmas Day, a three-day feast in honor of Louis XIV saves a
prince and does in his chef, played by Gerard Depardieu; in Lasse
Hallstrom's ``Chocolat,'' opening in December, Juliette Binoche
plays Vianne Rocher, who upsets a small French village when she
opens a chocolate shop across from the church on the first day of
Lent; and in Fina Torres' ``Woman on Top,'' opening on Sept. 22,
Penelope Cruz's Isabella chases her dreams to the United States
armed only with her spellbinding cooking skills.
</P>
<P>
   In some movies, changing a person's destiny takes just a bite:
Of Snow White's poison apple, for example, or the stolen dinner
candy that turns Violet into the dessert course in ``Willy Wonka
and the Chocolate Factory'' (1971). It takes a weekend for four
gourmands to cook and eat themselves into oblivion in Marco
Ferreri's ``Grande Bouffe'' (1973). And after a year of culinary
seduction in ``Like Water for Chocolate'' (1993), Tita and Pedro's
forbidden passion is consummated over a plate of quails in a
rose-petal sauce.
</P>
<P>
   In that film, the director Laura Esquivel reveals the difference
between fuel and enchantment when Pedro spies Tita's naked breast
while, on her hands and knees, she grinds mole. ``Tita understood
how contact with fire alters elements,'' we are told. What is a
breast, after all, but a useless lump of dough _ until it is
plunged into the boiling oil of a loving gaze: ``A breast touched
by love isn't just a breast.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is a meal concocted from the depth of someone's passionate
imagination mere repast. Food in the right hands can be a kind of
sorcery, and its magic can vex as well as bewitch. Tita's tears
fall into the wedding cake batter when Pedro is to marry her
sister; the cake itself makes the guests weep and yearn for the
love of their lives _ and then vomit in the river.
</P>
<P>
   Tita scatters Pedro's flowers into another night's dinner, and
the alchemy of inspiration and lust is intoxicating. ``This is the
nectar of the gods!'' he cries out. As the narrator explains: ``Not
only Tita's blood but her whole being dissolved into the rose
sauce, into the quails and into every aroma of the meal. That's how
she invaded Pedro's body.'' And how her other sister Gertrudis,
lusty and redolent of rose petals, attracts a stranger on a horse,
who carries her off naked into the sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Not all cooks can perform miracles, but when asked for her
secret, Tita says that all things must be cooked with love. That
sentiment is echoed in ``Woman on Top,'' where Isabella's cooking
can ``melt the hearts and palates of men.'' The first victim is her
husband _ ``It was love at first bite.'' But when she finds him
with another woman, she leaves Bahia for San Francisco. The whiff
of promise in her cinnamon-spiced coffee snakes out her open
windows and finds the nose of a TV producer who gives Isabella her
own cooking show. An instant success, she ends each segment with a
reminder to share the cooking with someone you love: ``I think it
always improves the flavor of the dish.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   But if the communion of a perfect meal in the company of someone
you love has a transcendent hint of the divine, the wrong dinner
companion can rot an egg faster than the devil. There is hardly a
scene in Peter Greenaway's film ``The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and
Her Lover'' (1990) when someone is not cooking, eating or making
love among the meat carcasses. The spectacle of food is
suffocating, nauseating, inescapable. At the restaurant he owns,
Albert (Michael Gambon) gorges himself nightly while his wife,
Georgina (Helen Mirren), spies Michael (Alan Howard) across the
room, a quiet man dining with a good book. Soon Georgina is leaving
Albert to his prawns and stealing away to make love to Michael in
the kitchen, with the aid of the sympathetic French chef. When
Albert looks up from his plate long enough to be suspicious, he
vows, ``I'll kill him and then I'll eat him.''
</P>
<P>
   He keeps the first part of his promise, stuffing Michael's mouth
with pages from a book. Georgina sees that he keeps the second.
``Cook Michael for me,'' she implores the chef. ``This was his
favorite restaurant!'' If Albert's life until now has been one
endless meal, it takes just one bite of Michael _ perched atop a
bed of vegetables, glazed like a suckling pig _ to spoil a
glutton's appetite.
</P>
<P>
   Gruesome as Georgina's revenge is, it seems minor compared to
that of the Roman general at the center of Shakespeare's ``Titus
Andronicus.'' In both the play and Julie Taymor's 1999 film
version, ``Titus,'' he invites the evil Queen Tamora to dinner and
serves her her own children baked in a pie.
</P>
<P>
   Joffe's ``Vatel'' is about an extravagant seafood feast. But he
points out that there's cannibalism in his movie too. Vatel is the
chef commissioned by the Prince de Conde to rescue his bankrupt
province by charming King Louis XIV with a banquet. But as Joffe
explained at the Cannes International Film Festival, where the film
had its premiere: ``The King is actually eating peas, and a little
chicken leg. All these great dishes were there so the king could
show how magnificent he was for everybody else. The feast is an
excuse as all meals are an excuse; the pleasure wonderfully hangs
over the motivations like a great curtain. You realize what's to be
consumed is people, decorated and served up just like the food.''
</P>
<P>
   The first casualty is Vatel himself, a perfectionist who worries
over every last candied grape, sticks his fingers in every bowl,
checks every ice sculpture. ``I wanted there to be the growing
sense of Vatel's weariness; he is the pivotal person to keep this
whole machine going endlessly,'' Joffe said. ``When the fish
doesn't arrive, for Vatel that's a metaphor that he's powerless. He
says at a certain point, `This feast will go down in history.' And
it did, because he died before it was served. He became the man who
died because the fish didn't arrive. This great feast that he's
made has stolen his whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is often the chef who pays the highest price for a
meal that changes other lives for an evening. In ``Big Night''
(1996), the brothers Primo (Tony Shalhoub) and Secondo (Stanley
Tucci) open an authentic Italian restaurant in a
spaghetti-and-meatballs neighborhood. ``If you give people time,
they learn,'' Primo wants to believe. Cooking is his art form, his
lifeline, his religion _ a higher calling not to be compromised. A
matter of life and death. He knows that while the pleasure might
not last, the memory of a life-changing meal can haunt all the
rest. He tells a woman he likes that he will take her to Bologna
one day, where she will taste a lasagna so good that ``you eat and
you have to kill yourself. After this, you can't live.''
</P>
<P>
   To save the restaurant from going under, the brothers splurge on
a last-chance dinner to honor the jazz star Louis Prima, hoping for
a much-needed dose of publicity. The big night slips on and Prima
does not arrive, but the dinner can't wait any longer; a chef can't
hold onto his creations. There are gasps from the guests when the
brothers roll out a ``timpano,'' a large stuffed pastry shaped like
a drum and filled, Primo says, with ``the most important things in
the world'' _ things like pasta and hard-boiled eggs. The suckling
pig has diners nearly fainting from disbelief. By dessert, one
woman is reclining on a table, another is weeping, ``My mother was
such a terrible cook.''
</P>
<P>
   Because that's what a good meal can do: Make you see what you
have been missing. And life is never quite the same after that.
</P>
<P>
   The trick of seduction, it seems, has everything to do with
persuading guilt and restraint to look the other way. In
``Chocolat,'' it's Vianne's ability to read her customers' desires
that causes the most suspicion, her insistence on indulging them in
spite of the prevailing atmosphere of chastity and
self-deprivation.
</P>
<P>
   That atmosphere exists also in the remote Danish village that is
the setting for Gabriel Axel's ``Babette's Feast'' (1987). After
dutifully making the glop that passes for food for two old,
unmarried sisters and their religious, ascetic friends, a poor,
widowed French cook (Stephane Audran) decides to secretly blow her
lottery winnings on an exotic meal. In the steam and glow of the
kitchen, Babette stuffs quails with foie gras and truffles, tops
blinis with gleaming piles of caviar. Terrified, the village folk
sit down to this ``witch's sabbath'' planning to save their souls
by shutting off their taste buds.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a pagan among the taste-no-evil townspeople: The
general, a last-minute guest, who has returned to find the sister
he once loved and left in rejected despair. As the villagers take
tentative bites through pursed lips, the general serenades the food
_ ``Real turtle soup! Veuve Clicquot! Blinis!'' _ caught in a
reverie about a great meal he once had in Paris, at the Cafe
Anglais. And gradually, in spite of themselves, the villagers begin
to taste, more vividly than they have ever tasted.
</P>
<P>
   Hearts and stomachs full, they smile and confess and forgive,
their petty grievances melted. Even the general's old broken heart
is mended. ``Every evening I shall sit down to dine with you, not
with my body, which is of no importance, but with my soul,'' he
tells his long-lost love at the doorstep. ``I have learned tonight
that in this beautiful world of ours, things are possible.''
</P>
<P>
   There is at the end of every memorable meal a kind of spiritual
apocalypse, the hollow sense that one might never be romanced and
seduced and satisfied in the same way again. After dinner, Babette
reveals that she was once the chef at the Cafe Anglais, and the
sisters bemoan losing her and her newfound fortune to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going back to Paris,'' she says. ``There's no one
waiting for me there. They're all dead. And I have no money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No money?''
</P>
<P>
   ``All spent. Dinner for 12 at the Cafe Anglais costs 10,000
francs.''
</P>
<P>
   But you'll be poor, they tell her, stuck here making ale bread
forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``An artist is never poor,'' she tells them. The meal was as
much a gift to herself as it was to them, a stolen whirl at
perfection in a disappointing world.
</P>
<P>
   ``In paradise you will be the great artist God meant you to
be,'' one of the sisters says to comfort her, taking Babette in her
arms. ``Ah, how you will delight the angels!''

   NEW YORK _ Arthur Ashe was not one for fig leaves _ symbolic fig
leaves, anyway. His views regarding human and race relations _ as
well, as I recall, virtually any other subject _ were never
anything but direct. You asked Arthur Ashe a question and he gave
you not only what was on his insightful mind, but what was in his
heart, as well.
</P>
<P>
   It's also true, however, that there is no record of his ever
having played naked in a tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The latter has contributed to some of the controversy regarding
that big bronze guy in the tree-shaded Arthur Ashe Commemorative
Garden outside Arthur Ashe Stadium in the National Tennis Center in
Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. So has the musculature. It's more
Rodin, or Arnold Schwarzenegger, than the lithe Ashe.
</P>
<P>
   Big Bronze Guy stands tall _ 14 feet tall, as a matter of fact _
and, without even benefit of a towel around his waist, tosses up a
ball that has forever disappeared into the sky as he serves.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that supposed to be _ a broken tennis racket?'' said
Rose Giaramita, a hair stylist from Forest Hills, Queens. ``I don't
get the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The racket indeed appears to be sawed-off, suggesting perhaps
something lethal, which Ashe's serve often was.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Arthur Ashe?'' said Isaac Manjo, a Maryland insurance
agent. ``That's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful display, it's a wonderful statement _ there
is a power and a stature to it, which reflects Arthur Ashe,'' said
Janet Cook of Philadelphia, ``but I'm offended by the nudity.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Burgess of Freeport, N.Y., loathed the statue to such a
degree that he handed out copies of a letter drafted to the U.S.
Tennis Association demanding the immediate removal of the statue.
He said he had gotten 1,000 signatures.
</P>
<P>
   To no avail. ``The statue stays,'' said Judy Levering, president
of the USTA. ``The sculpture is not a depiction of Arthur; it is a
representation honoring his legacy and memory. Some of the
confusion may be in that the artist's name for it is not in the
Garden, `Soul in Flight.' We probably should fix that.''
</P>
<P>
   Art is always in the eye of the beholder. You read it here
first. And art objects can have such emotional effect that they are
sometimes defaced or defamed, or, conversely, seen as depictions of
faith.
</P>
<P>
   In front of the United Center in Chicago, an iconic sculpture of
Michael Jordan soaring for a dunk shot has been generally hailed.
People throw coins at the foot of it, as though it were a wishing
well.
</P>
<P>
   But only a few miles away, the abstract Picasso sculpture in
front of City Hall drew a different response. It's ``a heroic
monument to some dead dodo, a Barbary ape, or some sort of Trojan
dove,'' said Alderman John J. Hoellen at the unveiling several
years ago. Dump it in Lake Michigan, he said, and put up a statue
of Ernie Banks.
</P>
<P>
   There is still no statue of Banks, the former Cubs star, but
many athletes have been memorialized in this fashion. And all of
them, from Stan Musial in St. Louis to Willie Mays in San Francisco
to Dan Marino in Florida, are representational _ but unlike, say,
Michelangelo's David and Eric Fischl's Big Bronze Guy, they are
also conventionally frocked. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Police Officer Frank Casaburi was assigned to a beat beside the
statue. ``My supervisor told me that it's pretty controversial,''
he said, ``and that some people may not understand it. But we've
had no incidents. Personally, I think it's beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   While Isaac Manjo, who moved to America from his native Liberia,
was initially put off by the sculpture not being a likeness of
Ashe, he seemed to appreciate the rest of it. ``I get a sense of a
man struggling, struggling to achieve,'' he said. ``Arthur Ashe was
a role model for me, and for many black folks. And if it wasn't for
his struggles, the doors wouldn't have been open for players like
Venus and Serena Williams.''
</P>
<P>
   And while many fans were intent on seeing the sculpture, it is
safe to say that they also had some interest in the other players,
many of whom were at least 8-feet shorter, with more modest
pectorals. But Lleyton Hewitt, who beat Arnaud Clement in his
quarterfinal match Wednesday, seemed to encapsulate the general
opinion of the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think of the statue?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What statue?'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one outside the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't know anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You were just involved in the tennis itself?''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt's eyebrows narrowed. ``I hope so,'' he said.

WITH A NEW RELEASE, A RELUCTANT MAKEOVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 10) 
(Karen Schoemer is senior editor for music for Us Weekly.) 
 By KAREN SCHOEMER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The woman who greets you in front of a Manhattan soul food joint
is not someone you would recognize. She is tall and imposing,
beautiful but remote. She wears slender black stretch capris and a
chic blue three-quarter-sleeve gingham shirt with matching
decorative eyeshades. Her posture is so perfect she could balance
books on her head; her cheeks have a spa-fresh glow. Demure honey
ringlets frame her face. She tells you that this home-cooking place
is a bit crowded and noisy for her liking; she would prefer the
upscale French boite across the street. She glides into a booth,
tucks her Bebe shopping bag under the table, orders a cappuccino _
no food today; she is staying slim for some forthcoming television
appearances _ and fixes you with a humorless, rather unhelpful
stare. You feel perplexed, a little thrown off. You look over her
shoulder, half expecting a wild-haired, grinning, explosive,
bluejeans-clad hippie babe to leap out from behind a pillar and
rescue you. You're not sure what to say to this creature. How
about: Nice to meet you _ now where's Joan Osborne?
</P>
<P>
   The music business has a long tradition of making over its
female artists, whether it's the Supremes in finishing school or
just the latest battery of stylists dispatched to a video shoot.
What's odd about Osborne's situation is that she seems to have
forced this transformation upon herself, and she's not entirely
comfortable with it. Is that a designer shirt? you can't help
asking. ``Well, yes, it's Agnes B.,'' she answers with a slight
squirm. ``I have a weird relationship to the whole celebrity
glamour thing, so I'm wary of saying that I bought a designer
shirt. I don't like that musicians have become mannequins for
designers, and that everything people wear gets reported on in the
media, and people don't have their own style anymore. But I did buy
it; they didn't give it to me. I mean, I like nice things, and I
don't have to buy my clothes at Goodwill anymore. It's nice to be
able to go into a store and pick out something beautiful and wear
it and like it. I don't think there's anything wrong with that.''
Then she allows herself a wee extra measure of defensiveness.
``It's not like it's Versace or anything,'' she grumbles.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne, 37, has a strong motivation for remaking herself. On
September 12 she releases ``Righteous Love,'' her first album in
five years and the long-delayed follow-up to her Grammy-nominated
major-label debut, ``Relish.'' What's on the line? Only her future
as a recording artist and her ability to continue making a living
at the thing she loves, music. Five years ago, Osborne, along with
Sheryl Crow and Sarah McLachlan, helped set a new standard for
strong, self-sufficient female singer-songwriters in the pop
marketplace. Osborne was the most unconventional of the three:
Raised in Kentucky, with a gutsy stage presence nurtured in New
York City dives and a voice that teetered between angelic ecstasy
and sexual abandon, she expressed an affinity for the blues that
had rarely been heard in a white girl since Janis Joplin.
``Relish'' was the success story of the year. By early 1996 she had
been nominated for seven Grammy Awards; the album crept into
Billboard's top 10, and the single ``One of Us,'' a quirky musing
on God, hit No. 4. Rolling Stone put her on the cover, and
Entertainment Weekly dubbed her ``Saint Joan.'' Her natural image
was a huge part of the appeal: Her kinky hair, lack of makeup and
exuberant smile suggested that a woman could be herself, look like
herself and still win the love of millions.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the scenes, problems were brewing. By the time of the
Grammys _ and by the way, she left empty-handed _ Osborne was
already starting to psych herself out. Wrestling with the notion of
a follow-up, she embarked on a compulsive spree of collaborations
with different producers, including David Lowery of the band
Cracker; Aaron Comess of the Spin Doctors; the hip-hop producer
Mike Mangini, and T-Bone Burnett, who had coaxed hits out of the
Wallflowers and Counting Crows. Most of the sessions were
fruitless. She even dallied once again with Rick Chertoff, who had
produced ``Relish'' and signed her to Mercury Records. But she was
uneasy about giving Chertoff too much control. For all the
accolades, she was dissatisfied with ``Relish.'' ``I think I have a
lot more in me than what's on there,'' she told Spin magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Her restlessness went beyond the recording studio. She traveled
to India to perform at a benefit for the Dalai Lama and studied
vocal technique with the qawwali singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan.
Finally, after three years of searching, she hit a groove with the
producer Mitchell Froom (his credits include albums with Suzanne
Vega and Elvis Costello). And then out of nowhere she became the
victim of a music-industry drive-by. Mercury's parent company,
Polygram, was bought by Seagram and merged with Universal. Late in
1999, her album still unfinished, Osborne was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   She says she tried not to take it personally. ``My first
reaction was: Wow! That's a bad business decision. If I were a
business person, I would not choose to drop me.'' She decided to
continue work on the album using her own money. ``It became a
little scary when I realized that if I couldn't get another deal, I
was going to lose my house,'' she says matter-of-factly. She did
get another deal, curiously enough, with Interscope, a label within
the Universal fold. ``It was a risk,'' Osborne says now. ``But I
think it would have been a greater risk for me not to do it. I
didn't have anything to fall back on. It's not like I could start
making a living at Wall Street the next day. I just thought, well,
this is one of those moments that you read about in people's
stories, when they're up against a wall and they have to take a
chance and believe in themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Righteous Love'' is ready to be heard, but Osborne's struggles
probably aren't over. The pop world is a completely different place
now than it was five years ago. Studio-sculptured, choreographed
and scripted idols like Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera have
become the new female role models. The momentum of Lilith Fair has
expired for a more up-to-date example of gung-ho female
togetherness _ check out ``The Powerpuff Girls.'' Osborne, who
lives in Manhattan, insists she's not starting from scratch. ``As
fickle as audiences or the media can be, I still walk around the
streets of New York and strangers ask me, `When is your new record
coming out?''' she says. ``That will happen a couple of times a
day. So I do have a feeling like they're still out there. I don't
know how many people are out there, but there's somebody that still
wants to hear more.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet she realizes that she is under pressure, even if it's
self-inflicted, to conform to a less forgiving and indulgent set of
music-business rules. ``I know the word artist has been adulterated
in the context of the music business, but I still believe in what
that means for myself,'' she says. ``So to keep functioning within
a system where it doesn't really matter if you're an artist or not
_ you just have to sell records and whatever sells is acceptable
and legitimate _ well, that can be difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``Righteous Love,'' Osborne is trying to have it both ways:
She wants to express raw passion and sexual heat but do it in a
restrained enough way to be digestible by a wide audience. She
needs to deliver a product that will make a healthy return on her
label's investment, or risk losing the financial backing that
allows her to work at a broad mainstream level; yet she also needs
to satisfy a core audience that looks to her for music of lasting
substance. It's a lot to accomplish. ``Righteous Love'' has some
glorious moments: The title track shimmies and sways like a
beefed-up version of early '60s Brill Building soul, and ``Poisoned
Apples (Hallelujah)'' equals the best moments on ``Relish'' for its
conflation of the sexual and the spiritual. Her cover of Bob
Dylan's ``To Make You Feel My Love'' is so sublime, you are tricked
into thinking it's one of the best songs he ever wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne herself admits that at times she has been too distracted
by other aspects of the business to focus on the goal at hand.
``I'm jealous of people like Neil Young who came of age in the '60s
and '70s, when it wasn't part of your job to pose for a million
magazine pictures and look like a model,'' she says. `` 'Cause I
don't, and it's hard to try. I think my music has suffered because
of the time I have to put into other things. I often struggle with
the thought that here I am spending an hour at the gym because I
have to look a certain way, because otherwise I won't be palatable
to an audience. When in reality I would rather be learning to play
the guitar better or spending more time writing. It is a
compromise; it is a balancing act.''

 &HT;    Texas food stamp rolls drop by 40 percent since 1996
 &HT;    By Gaiutra Bahadur
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Cynthia Ali, a working mother of five from the
Lincoln Gardens section of East Austin, almost applied for food
stamps last May.
</P>
<P>
   Then she found out she would need to take time off from her job
as a kitchen manager to get pay stubs from a former boss and to
ferry her kids to the local Texas Works office to be fingerprinted
and photographed.
</P>
<P>
   The eligibility interview would last about 90 minutes, if it
kept pace with the statewide average.
</P>
<P>
   Every hour would cost Ali $9.46 in wages. It would take seven
hours to consume the average food stamp benefit of $71 per person
per month. That would not be enough to feed Ali's weeks-old
granddaughter Enfamil baby formula for the full month. And in one
to three months, she'd have to take time off again to be
recertified because of a 1995 state law designed to fight fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't want to go through that,'' Ali said. ``I just
said, ``Forget about it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a million fewer Texans receive food stamps today than in
1996, the year that Congress overhauled welfare. The 41 percent
drop _ slightly more than the nationwide decline of 33 percent _ is
due partly because of lower unemployment rates and a strong
economy.
</P>
<P>
   But food banks report a steady demand for their services, and
anti-hunger advocates say many people have left the rolls because
of a complex and burdensome application process. The government
estimates that 37 percent of people eligible for food stamps aren't
getting them.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by America's Second Harvest, a hunger relief
group based in Chicago, showed that food stamp applications in 29
states and the District of Columbia are 10 to 36 pages long. The
average application is 12 pages long. And in all states except
North Carolina, the applications require a 9th to 12th grade
reading level.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, called ``The Red Tape Divide,'' some
states ask food stamp applicants about income from baby-sitting,
panhandling, bingo and blood donations. Some demand garage sale
receipts. And others ask about assets in the form of burial plots,
tools and livestock.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the form spans four pages _ longer than applications
for a federal firearms permit, the federal school lunch program or
a school bus driver's license. According to America's Second
Harvest, the Texas application requires a 12th grade reading level
and asks three questions that the group says are not necessary to
determine eligibility:
</P>
<P>
   -- The value of a house or land.
</P>
<P>
   -- The value of life insurance and/or pensions.
</P>
<P>
   -- The value of gifts or loans from charities, friends or
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Traylor, a spokesman for the Department of Human Services,
said Texas uses a single form to determine eligibility for food
stamps, Medicaid and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families. That
means some questions not specifically relevant to food stamp
eligibility might be asked, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Traylor also said details about payments on a home could help,
not hinder, an applicant for food stamps; that gifts and loans,
depending on the size and circumstances, could count as assets; and
that questions about life insurance, while not required by the
federal government, ``provide clues to unreportable income.''
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Public Policy Priorities, an Austin-based
research institute that focuses on poverty and its impact, worked
with advocates, legislative aides and case workers from the
Department of Human Services to design a new application to be
tested in five cities, including Houston, Pampa, Mission and Del
Rio. The pilot will begin as soon as the agency receives approval
from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The experimental application is four pages longer than the
current one, but its language is simpler and its tone is more
helpful. It has breakout boxes with ``Important Information for
Immigrants'' and separate sections in Spanish. Its text is larger
and easier on the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Celia Hagert, a nutritional policy expert with the center, said
the new application would be a step in the right direction but more
needs to be done to reduce the ``burden on working families, who
need to take time off from work to apply.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocacy groups suggest extended office hours, limiting
face-to-face interviews for recertification to once a year and
allowing food stamp enrollees to recertify by phone or mail in the
interim. They also support more training for case workers to cut
down on confusion about who is eligible for food stamps or other
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Hagert said some of the $27 billion in federal money Texas
received from Sept. 1998 to Aug. 31, 1999 _ as a result of its
success in reducing welfare fraud _ should be used for outreach to
Texans eligible for food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Traylor said the state's decline in food stamp rolls outpaced
the country's decline partly because of Texas' large share of
immigrants. In 1996, Congress made many immigrants ineligible for
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   About 935,000 legal immigrants, or about 5 percent of the
caseload, lost their food stamp eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Public Policy Priorities estimates that about 12
percent of the decline in Texas over the last four years can be
attributed to this change in federal policy.

AUSTRALIA'S `STOLEN GENERATION' TRIES TO HEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Valerie Murphy stood in the alley behind her
modest house on the tattered fringe of downtown, smoking nervously,
looking away as if to keep tears from coming into her eyes. Even
now, four decades later, she said she could hardly speak of the
time when her life had been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   At 53, she is part of what is known here as the ``stolen
generation,'' one of perhaps 100,000 Aboriginal children, most of
them light skinned, who were taken from their parents between 1910
and 1970 and placed into training homes to be assimilated into the
dominant white culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like thinking about it,'' Murphy said, producing a
photograph of herself, uncertainty and fear on her face, with other
girls at the Cootamundra Training Home for Girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 5 or 6 when they took me. Eleven years I was there. When
you did something wrong, they put you in a room like a box. I would
bang and bang to get out of that box. When I was 14, the police
flogged me. They have taken my life away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Summer Olympics, which begin Sept. 15, will showcase
Sydney's famous Opera House, its arresting harbor vistas and its
fabulous swimmers. The Games will also focus attention on the
plight of the Aborigines, Australia's indigenous minority who
originally inhabited the continent 50,000 years ago but were
marginalized over the past two centuries by European settlers.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment of the Aboriginals, who make up about 400,000 of
Australia's 19 million people, has a bleak resonance with the
struggles of American Indians and blacks in the United States.
Indigenous people were not allowed to vote until 1962 in Australia
and were not counted in the national census until 1967. Life
expectancy is 18 years shorter for Aboriginals, average incomes are
one-third lower and the unemployment rate _ 34 percent _ is nearly
five times the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with alcohol, drugs, suicide, domestic violence and
high birth rates are severe. A quarter of the Aboriginals age 55 or
over have never been to school. Aborigines account for half of the
young people incarcerated in the juvenile justice system.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian government will spend $1.5 billion on Aboriginal
programs this year, addressing disadvantages in health, education,
employment and housing. In May, more than 200,000 people marched
through Sydney in support of racial equality. But contentious
debate persists on how to achieve reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Only last week, after a number of reprimands, the conservative
government of Prime Minister John Howard announced that it would no
longer cooperate with the United Nations' attempt to investigate
Australia's human rights practices.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently concerned about the government's vulnerability to
demands for compensation, Howard has declined to formally apologize
to the Aborigines. He has also opposed a civil rights treaty for
Aborigines. Opinion polls indicate that most Australians support
Howard in opposition to special treatment for indigenous people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the prime minister and I have expressed our personal
feelings of deep sorrow in relation to the injustices suffered by
indigenous Australians as a result of the practices of past
generations,'' said Sen. John Herron, the minister for Aboriginal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But the government does not support a formal apology, Herron
said, because it ``could imply that present generations are in some
way responsible and accountable for the actions of earlier
generations, actions that were sanctioned by the laws of the time,
and that were believed to be in the best interests of the children
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Aborigines have sharply criticized Herron for suggesting that
perhaps only 10 percent of Aboriginal children were taken from
their families and for calling the term ``stolen generation''
rhetorical.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say we were not stolen,'' Murphy said outside her home in
the Redfern section of Sydney. ``It made me cry, it hurt so much.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she was not seeking financial reparation from the
government, only an apology for past wrongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my heart, it would be helpful,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's most celebrated Aborigine, Cathy Freeman, the world
champion in the 400-meter sprint and an Olympic gold medal
favorite, called the federal government insensitive in July and
revealed that her grandmother had been taken from her parents and
did not know her own birthday or her precise age.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an endemic problem ignored by most Australians, and
there seems to be compassion fatigue for acknowledging the
problem,'' said Sen. Aden Ridgeway, the only Aboriginal member of
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the Aborigines will be made visible during the
Olympics in both celebration and protest. Juan Antonio Samaranch,
president of the International Olympic Committee, plans to mention
the Aborigines in his remarks during opening ceremonies. The
boomerang, an Aboriginal hunting tool, has been incorporated into
the official Olympic logo.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers will allow the red, black and yellow Aboriginal flag
_ depicting the earth, the skin of the indigenous people and the
sun _ to be flown at Olympic stadiums. Freeman and others will also
be welcomed to carry the flag during victory laps.
</P>
<P>
   In Victoria Park, just outside Sydney's central business
district, televisions will be hooked up so that protesters
occupying 40 or so tents at the so-called Aboriginal Tent Embassy
can watch Freeman run. A fire ritual is performed each day at the
encampment as branches from gum trees are placed on smoking logs in
a gesture of peace and healing. Oral histories will be presented at
Aboriginal forums in the park during the Games, and a rally is
planned for the day the Games open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the world to know that this country is at war with its
indigenous people,'' said Isabell Coe, the advocate who started the
tent embassy in July.
</P>
<P>
   Another group is planning to form a human chain along the road
outside the Sydney airport to make Olympic visitors aware of the
despairing condition of Australia's indigenous people. Trevor
Close, an Aboriginal activist, said he planned to camp with some
protesters near the Olympic Stadium and might resort to violent
clashes if the police interfere.
</P>
<P>
   The Aborigines were nomadic hunter-gatherers still using stone
tools when European settlers, primarily British convicts, arrived
in 1788. Their encounter with white migration proved ruinous to the
Aborigines' way of life. Many were massacred, others died of
diseases to which they were not immune and survivors were placed in
missions run by churches and the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are being treated like aliens in our own country,'' Coe
said. ``The only place we are winning is the number of prisoners.''

SYDNEY, Australia: of prisoners.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Still, Aboriginals have managed to produce notable achievements
in recent years on the national and world stage. Nova
Perris-Kneebone became the first Aborigine to win a gold medal as
part of Australia's field hockey team at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
Freeman is a two-time world champion and Olympic silver medalist in
the 400 meters. The Aboriginal writer Kim Scott won a share of
Australia's top fiction prize this year.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, two members of the so-called stolen
generation had their claims for reparation dismissed last month in
a federal test case.
</P>
<P>
   The urban despair of Sydney's Aborigines is apparent in Murphy's
blighted neighborhood, known as ``the block,'' a failed land-grant
experiment for indigenous people. It is a rat- and drug-infested
collection of graffiti-scarred houses where heroin addicts inject
themselves 50 yards from a playground where children frolic on
swings.
</P>
<P>
   Ridgeway, the Aboriginal senator, said the sense of fatalism can
be overcome only by self-determination, including the recognition
of traditional laws, diversionary programs instead of mandatory
prison sentencing and restoring the role of Aboriginal elders
within communities. But the current government is concerned that
the creation of two sets of laws would diminish the sense of
Australia as a single nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are talking about a disciplinary code that is breached
and the penalty enacted might be a spear in the thigh, by today's
values that would be something broadly unacceptable,'' said Philip
Ruddock, the minister of immigration and multicultural affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The infant mortality rate among Aboriginals, once 20 times the
national average, has decreased to three times the national
average. While only a handful of Aborigines once went to college,
there are now 8,000 college graduates, ministry statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   But a much more comprehensive effort needs to be taken, Ridgeway
contended, or the cycle of poverty and despair will only perpetuate
itself under the current welfare state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most a young Aboriginal person can expect to achieve is to
work for the dole scheme, and he essentially reaches that at 16, 17
or 18,'' Ridgeway said. ``There is nothing beyond that.
Incarceration becomes a badge of honor, a right of passage into
adulthood.''

CITIGROUP TO BUY ASSOCIATES FIRST FOR $31.1 BILLION

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Continuing its campaign to become the dominant
financial services provider around the globe, Citigroup said
Wednesday that it would buy Associates First Capital Corp., the
biggest American consumer-finance company, for about $31.1 billion
in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition, the biggest since the formation of Citigroup in
1998, would give Citigroup a significant position in consumer
lending in Japan and a few other countries. It also would improve
Citigroup's standing in the credit card and commercial leasing
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This transaction really fits better than most anything that we
could think about,'' said Sanford I. Weill, the acquisitive
chairman and chief executive of Citigroup. ``From the
consumer-finance point of view, the exciting thing is the global
presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before he engineered the merger of Travelers Corp. with
Citicorp in 1998 _ a deal that required legislative changes in
Washington that finally occurred last year _ Weill was intent on
building his company's overseas businesses, especially in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In one swoop, Citigroup would become the fifth biggest consumer
finance company in Japan, the world's second biggest market for
consumer lending, Weill said. Buying Associates First would give
Citigroup a lending business to match up with the $77 billion in
deposits it holds outside of the United States. Those deposits
could provide a low-cost source of funding for more lending to
foreign consumers to buy cars, appliances and other goods, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Weill said the deal should add 10 cents a share to Citigroup's
earnings next year, despite the hefty premium Citigroup is paying.
Citigroup agreed to swap 0.7334 share of its stock for each share
of Associates First's stock. That translates to $42.49 a share, or
nearly 52 percent more than the $28 closing price for Associates
First's stock on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Associates First soared on the deal, rising 37.5
percent, or $10.50, to $38.50 in heavy trading on the New York
Stock Exchange. But, to Weill's obvious disappointment. Citigroup's
stock dropped $3.02, to $54.92. The two stocks were the most
heavily traded shares on the New York exchange Wednesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Shares of other finance companies also rose on speculation that
there may be more acquisitions. Household International rose $2.56,
to $50.19. Shares of finance companies have been depressed by
concerns about the quality of their loans and government inquiries
into their lending practices.
</P>
<P>
   David Sandor, a spokesman for Associates First, said that the
Justice Department had begun an investigation of the industry two
years ago, but the company had never been charged with any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   If completed, the acquisition would be the fourth-biggest deal
involving United States financial companies and the eighth-biggest
in the financial sector anywhere in the world, according to Thomson
Financial Securities Data.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think Sandy scored,'' said Robert Albertson,
president of Pilot Financial, a money management firm in New York.
``It may not be his biggest deal but it may be his best deal. It's
a superb strategic and tactical fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Albertson and other analysts said they were not concerned about
the rich price as long as the deal made strategic sense and would
add to Citigroup's earnings quickly. Several of them predicted that
the acquisition would yield even bigger immediate gains than
promised.
</P>
<P>
   Weill said the combination should result in a reduction of $400
million in costs in the first year and $600 million over two years.
About half of those savings would come from combining the two
companies' credit-card operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Associates First operates private-label credit card programs for
several companies, including some retailers, such as Radio Shack,
and some operators of gas stations. Citigroup already is the
biggest company in the United States credit card business, through
its Citibank Visa and MasterCard products.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts us in the oil-card business, which is a very good
margin business and very profitable,'' said Robert Lipp, who
oversees Citigroup's consumer finance businesses and was recently
named a director of the company. Lipp said that after the
acquisition is completed later this year Citigroup would have
between $85 billion and $90 billion in outstanding credit on its
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Associates First started out in South Bend, Ind., as an
automobile finance company, lending people money to buy Model T
Fords. It was owned for almost 25 years by Gulf &AMP; Western Corp.,
before that company sold it to Ford Motor Co. Ford spun off a 20
percent stake in Associates First in a public stock sale in 1996
and sold the rest two years later.
</P>
<P>
   To cover the costs of merging the companies' operations,
Citigroup will take charges against its earnings of between $600
million and $700 million before taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Judah Kraushaar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., said the big
opportunity for Citigroup is in combining the companies'
consumer-lending units. Citigroup's 1,200 Citifinancial branches
are considerably more productive and profitable than Associates
First's 750 full-service branches. Most of the loans made through
Associates First's branches are home-equity loans, in which
consumers borrow against the value they have built up in their
homes. Citifinancial's branches offer a wider array of loan
products, some of which are more profitable than home-equity loans.
</P>
<P>
   By bringing the acquired branches closer to its own standards,
Citigroup could reap big gains, Kraushaar said. He estimated that
the deal would add 15 cents a share to Citigroup's earnings next
year even with ``no revenue synergies.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraushaar predicted that Weill would follow up this deal with
the acquisition of another consumer finance company in Japan in an
effort to quickly make Citigroup one of the top-ranked companies in
that market.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his office mesmerized by the changing stock prices on
a nearby computer screen. Weill did not argue with that theory.
``It will probably be a pretty fair guess,'' he said, with a smile.

ENOUGH ABOUT ANGELS: THE DEVIL GETS HIS DUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 10) 
 By JAMIE MALANOWSKI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Angels have been gracing pop culture fairly ostentatiously these
last several years _ ``Touched by an Angel,'' ``City of Angels,''
``Angels in the Outfield,'' ``Angels in America,'' John Travolta
spectacularly spreading his wings in ``Michael,'' the elevation of
``It's a Wonderful Life'' to a basic text of American civilization.
But lately, and almost unnoticed in the seraphic swell, the Devil
has been getting his due.
</P>
<P>
   Date the current surge to 1997, when Al Pacino was so
charismatically diabolical in ``The Devil's Advocate.'' Since then,
the Devil has been a featured player in three television series,
``G&AMP;E,'' ``Brimstone'' and ``God, the Devil and Bob''; had a big
part last year in the Arnold Schwarzenegger Christmas movie ``End
of Days''; prominently appeared in the Johnny Depp vehicle ``The
Ninth Gate''; was the prime mover of the plot of the Kim Basinger
movie ``Bless the Child'' this summer; and had the key supporting
part _ the best part, really, and one in which he showed a
surprising comic touch and a long-hidden singing voice _ in ``South
Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut,'' last summer's animation hit.
</P>
<P>
   I know what you're thinking: With as many people in Hollywood
headed for hell as the religious right seems to think, why such an
uneven output? All three television series tanked. The big ``Ninth
Gate'' reunion of Roman Polanski and the Devil turned out to be
less a reimagining of ``Rosemary's Baby'' than leftovers on the
order of ``The Odd Couple II.'' And ``End of Days,'' dramatically
speaking, fell short of apocalyptic. But the Devil must have an
awfully good agent: This fall will have no fewer than five movies
featuring Old Nick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bedazzled,'' a remake of the Peter Cook-Dudley Moore classic,
stars Brendan Fraser as a nerdy young man who, in exchange for the
fulfillment of seven wishes, surrenders his soul to a very
seductive Devil played by Elizabeth Hurley. ``Little Nicky'' is a
comedy in which the casting seems half the attraction: Adam Sandler
as Satan's good son, Harvey Keitel as Satan and Rodney Dangerfield
as Satan's father. In ``Lost Souls,'' a thriller, Winona Ryder
plays a devout schoolteacher who becomes aware of a Satanic
conspiracy against a New York journalist (like, only one?). ``Simon
Magus,'' a British film by Ben Hopkins set in 19th-century Europe,
is about a young man seemingly possessed by the Devil (Ian Holm,
who, making sure that all his bases are covered in the afterlife,
played a Satan-fighting priest in ``Bless the Child''). And the
granddaddy of them all, ``The Exorcist,'' will be rereleased with
additional material never shown before _ perhaps scenes where the
poor girl stops spewing pea soup and moves on to beef barley and
chicken with stars. Not to give anything short shrift, hovering
somewhere in straight-to-videoland is ``G-Men From Hell,'' in which
the Devil is portrayed by Robert Goulet.
</P>
<P>
   While this does seem to be an especially verdant crop full of
stellar performers, devil movies have always been with us. A search
of the Internet Movie Database (imdb.com), in a highly unofficial
but still usefully suggestive count, yields 290 movies about the
Devil, starting with Georges Melies' ``Le Cabinet de
Mephistopheles,'' which was made in 1897; but more than half the
films have been made since 1980. Among the more provocative items
on the list: ``Inflation'' (1942), in which the Devil, in response
to a telephone call from Adolf Hitler, begins wrecking the American
economy by encouraging people to cash in their war bonds, to hoard
and to spend too much money (no doubt an impressionable Alan
Greenspan attended repeated showings); ``Santa Claus'' (1959), in
which Santa has to battle Satan's minions before delivering his
Christmas Eve rewards; ``Satan's Cheerleaders'' (1977), in which
the members of a high school cheerleading squad turn out to be _ as
many have long suspected _ ringleaders of a Satanic cult;
``Fertilize the Blaspheming Bombshell'' (1990), in which a comely
lass is menaced by Satan worshipers en route from New York to Las
Vegas, and ``Girlfriend from Hell'' (1990), in which the Devil,
fleeing one of God's agents, hides in the body of a young woman on
a blind date. Perhaps this is based on a true story.
</P>
<P>
   Although we missed these films, we've seen plenty of others.
Some general themes emerge.
</P>
<P>
   1. HOLLYWOOD CAN'T AGREE ON WHAT THE DEVIL CAN DO. Moviemakers
are pretty consistent about the Devil's being the source of all
evil in the world, but there's a range of opinion on other matters,
beginning with whether he's the Devil at all. Sometimes the
character we see is clearly Satan ( Pacino in ``The Devil's
Advocate,'' the Beast in ``Rosemary's Baby''); sometimes he is the
Devil in human form (Gabriel Byrne in ``End of Days''), and
sometimes he's the Devil's son (Sam Neill in the ``Omen'' sequels).
Sometimes, for whatever reason, the Devil is more reclusive, and we
meet his emissary or servant (Rufus Sewell in ``Bless the Child'').
Sometimes it's not clear whom we're seeing. Emmanuelle Seigner may
be the Devil in ``The Ninth Gate,'' but the whole movie is about
how complicated it is to summon the Devil, and she's been hanging
around the whole picture. In ``Damn Yankees,'' is Ray Walston the
Devil, or just his field representative in Washington, D.C.? And
why isn't his office on K Street?
</P>
<P>
   Other questions remain. Sometimes the Devil can be thwarted by
faith _ in ``The Evil'' (1978), when the psychologist played by
Richard Crenna uses a crucifix to stab Victor Buono, playing Satan
as a grouchy neighbor who won't give back your baseball, it stymies
Satan long enough for Crenna to escape. Rediscovering faith helps
Schwarzenegger thwart the devil in ``End of Days.'' But they're
stars. Faith is fairly useless to secondary characters, like the
elderly priest in ``The Omen'' whose function in the movie is to
warn a skeptical Gregory Peck that he really shouldn't be worrying
about getting his son into a good prep school, and then to die
gruesomely. Sometimes faith has nothing to do with it: In
``Crossroads'' (1983), the hero's classical-music training enables
him to win a blues-guitar showdown and beat the Devil.
</P>
<P>
   There are other discrepancies. Usually the Devil has
extraordinary demonic powers. But at other times he seems weaker,
resorting to agents _ a dog in ``The Omen,'' street kids in ``Bless
the Child'' _ to wreak havoc. Occasionally he goes to great lengths
to avoid suspicion: In ``The Omen,'' he kills a character by
causing him to be decapitated by a runaway cart _ nothing a veteran
police officer hasn't seen before; in ``Bless the Child,'' the
Devil proves as inept as a Bond villain _ instead of just offing
Kim Basinger, he tries to kill her by causing her to drive off a
bridge, and she gets away. All this is very confusing. Is the Devil
who causes a lighting bolt to break a shaft off a church and then
sends it ripping through the air to pierce a cleric in ``The Omen''
the same Devil who relies on sweaty spells, deal-making and the
drug-dispensing ministrations of Ruth Gordon just to get a young
woman pregnant in ``Rosemary's Baby''? Can the Devil who blows up
restaurants on a whim in ``End of Days'' be the same fussy
businessman who patiently waits for Mickey Rourke to track down
Johnny Favorite in ``Angel Heart''? Why does Pacino's Devil let his
minions spend so much time shredding documents to thwart a
government investigation if he's perfectly capable, as he
demonstrates, of just killing the investigator?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe he is _ the big source book is hardly consistent.
Professor Elaine Pagels, the Harrington Speare Professor of
Religion at Princeton University, points out in her book ``The
Origin of Satan'' that the first few times Satan appears in the Old
Testament, he's just a servant of God sent to obstruct human
activity _ on God's orders. Gradually, Satan's role evolves. He
prods God to test Job; later, Satan is blamed for pushing King
David into an unpopular tax plan. Only in Isaiah do we finally get
the 411 about the rebellion of the angels who sought to elevate
themselves above God. And in the New Testament, Jesus arrives to
redeem the world from Satan, who aims to stop him. In the first
gospels, Satan tempts Jesus personally; in the last gospel, Jesus
is tempted by people. If the Bible isn't consistent about what the
Devil does, how can we expect Hollywood to be?
</P>
<P>
   2. THE DEVIL IS CURIOUSLY ENCUMBERED BY RULES, BOUNDARIES,
BUREAUCRACY. In ``The Evil,'' he is stuck in the basement of an
old, spooky house, and would never get out without the help of some
well-meaning social workers (secular humanists!) who move in. In
``The Ninth Gate,'' Satan can be summoned only with secret
incantations recited in the right order _ placing the film at odds
with all the movies in which he roams around at will. In ``End of
Days,'' Satan has to assume human form, and impregnate a certain
woman by a certain date to establish his realm; he may be the
Prince of Darkness, but punctuality counts. In ``Crossroads,'' a
blues singer signs his soul away on paper. In ``Damn Yankees,'' the
contract has an escape clause. In ``Angel Heart,'' all the Devil
wants is the soul he was promised. Maybe one day we'll get an
Arthur Miller version, Satan Loman, his feet aching, wearily
pushing his temptations on an inattentive world.
</P>
<P>
   3. IT DOESN'T PAY TO WORK FOR THE DEVIL. Although the Devil
seems to have cast a kindly glance at the old folks who served him
in ``Rosemary's Baby,'' elsewhere he is literally the Boss From
Hell. In ``Omen III,'' ``Angel Heart'' and ``The Devil's
Advocate,'' useful, loyal retainers are crisply eliminated the
moment they cause Satan any trouble. In ``Damn Yankees,'' when his
assistant, Lola, gets too sweet on her intended victim, the Devil
makes her ugly. When you go to work for the Devil, think in terms
of immediate payoffs; his pension plan is weak.
</P>
<P>
   4. THE DEVIL IS ALWAYS PUTTING CHILDREN FIRST. A surprisingly
large number of movies have to do with Satan's wanting to be a
father. Obviously, there's ``Rosemary's Baby.'' But ``The Omen'' is
about the Devil's son, ``End of Days'' about the Devil wanting to
sire a son, and ``The Devil's Advocate'' about Satan wanting his
son to sire a son. You can't really say that ``The Witches of
Eastwick'' is about the Devil's wanting to sire a son, but in the
end, he winds up with three. ``Little Nicky,'' clearly, is going to
fall somewhere in this tradition. Also clearly, these plot lines
are a reaction to the story of Jesus, the Son of God. But the
impulse isn't the same: Jesus comes to redeem humanity by his
death, a sacrifice no son of Satan is being asked to make. Why does
Satan need an heir? Is he going somewhere? Does he have expansion
plans? Who's going to mentor the kid? And if he spends his
apprenticeship drinking, taking drugs and chasing women, doesn't
that constitute learning the business?
</P>
<P>
   5. EVERYBODY LIKES TO PLAY VILLAINS. Jesus has been played by
Max Von Sydow, Jeffrey Hunter and Willem Dafoe. But look who has
played the devil: Pacino, Jack Nicholson, Robert De Niro, George C.
Scott, Billy Crystal, Claude Rains, Donald Pleasence, Sam Neill,
Vincent Price, Terrence Stamp and Mickey Rooney. That's a lot of
awardware on hell's mantelpiece.
</P>
<P>
   6. IT'S HARD TO BE TEMPTING. Devils in the movies generally come
in two forms: Destroyers and tempters. The destroyers are fairly
easy to place _ you just have to be bad. It's harder to be the
tempter _ for the scene to work, Satan really has to be persuasive.
You can see how hard it is in last year's miniseries ``Jesus,'' in
which Jeroen Krabbe, a capable actor, had to persuade Jesus to
renounce his mission. Krabbe was about as convincing as a car
dealer; far better at the art of closing are Nicholson and Pacino.
In ``Eastwick,'' Nicholson's Devil plays on each woman's
vulnerability, teasing out her small resentments and places of
self-pity to bring her along. In ``The Devil's Advocate,'' Pacino
goes one better: He actively encourages the Keanu Reeves character
to do the right thing, knowing that he has so cleverly stacked the
deck that Reeves will reject the virtuous alternative. In the end,
he still overplays his hand, and Reeves thwarts him by killing
himself _ which seems to be the method of choice for thwarting the
Devil (see Schwarzenegger in ``End of Days'' and Jason Miller in
``The Exorcist'').
</P>
<P>
   But surely these are only temporary setbacks. That's the thing
about the Devil _ he's always practicing.

COMMENTARY: BUSH'S MEDICARE FIX 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Uh-oh.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has come up with a plan to overhaul Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   This should be interesting. It's always interesting when the
foxes roll up their sleeves and start renovating the chicken coop.
</P>
<P>
   To say that the Republican Party has been hostile to Medicare is
to engage in the grossest of understatements. To Ronald Reagan,
Medicare was an affront to the very idea of America. Robert Dallek,
in his biography of Lyndon Johnson, ``Flawed Giant,'' recalled that
Reagan ``saw Medicare as the advance wave of socialism, which would
`invade every area of freedom in this country.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Reagan,'' wrote Dallek, ``predicted that Medicare would compel
Americans to spend their `sunset years telling our children and our
children's children what it was like in America when men were
free.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, when the Republicans were trying to cut taxes
while at the same time eliminating $270 billion in anticipated
Medicare expenditures, Bob Dole was bragging about the fact that he
had opposed the original Medicare bill in 1965, opting instead to
support a voluntary alternative.
</P>
<P>
   And during that same budget fight, Newt Gingrich, apparently
referring to the original fee-for-service version of Medicare that
by then had become cherished by the elderly, wisecracked: ``We
don't get rid of it in Round One because we don't think it's
politically smart.''
</P>
<P>
   If it had been up to the Republicans there would have been no
Medicare. And if you want to conjure up something frightening,
think of America without it.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Bush, the GOP's affable front man for the likes of
Trent Lott, Dick Armey and Tom DeLay, and he's suddenly got a plan
to fix Medicare. This is the same Bush whose own state of Texas has
not bothered to comply with a 1996 consent decree requiring it to
provide appropriate health care services to more than 1.5 million
children who were eligible for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposed renovation of Medicare includes a prescription
drug benefit. That applause you hear is coming from the executives
of the drug companies and the insurance industry. They like Bush's
plans. Which should tell you something.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than providing the elderly with the traditional defined
benefits under Medicare, the Texas governor would set up a
potentially chaotic system in which private insurers would compete
with the government to provide health coverage for the nation's 39
million Medicare beneficiaries. The prescription drug benefit would
come largely in the form of a government subsidy to be used to
purchase the drug benefit from private insurers.
</P>
<P>
   A prescription drug benefit was not always a cornerstone of
Bush's presidential campaign. Health care was hardly his strong
point, or even a matter of major interest to him. But polls seemed
to show that Vice President Al Gore was scoring points by pressing
hard for his prescription drug proposal, which would be part of the
existing Medicare program and would provide greater benefits to
more people.
</P>
<P>
   It makes a difference whether the drug benefit is contained
within an expanded Medicare program (Gore's proposal) or is farmed
out via subsidies to private insurers, as Bush wants. Ron Pollack,
the executive director of Families USA, a nonpartisan, nonprofit
advocacy group for health care consumers, discussed this in an
interview Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   ``The pharmaceutical industry fears, I think correctly, that if
Medicare covers prescription drugs then the Medicare program will
use its very significant bargaining clout on behalf of the 39
million beneficiaries to get prices down. So the pharmaceutical
industry is apoplectic about the notion of expanding Medicare to
cover prescription drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's attempt at a better-late-than-never plan, especially one
that would turn so many of the certainties of Medicare over to the
whims of profit-oriented insurance companies and health maintenance
organizations, has many longtime health care advocates worried. The
fear is not only that this is not in the best interest of the
nation's elderly, but that the compassionately conservative Bush is
following through on the Republicans' decades-long dream of
thoroughly undermining Medicare.

NEW MOVES FROM A LAND BEYOND CATEGORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 10) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Diversity, thy name is individuality. That may well
be the message of ``France Moves,'' a major festival of French
contemporary dance that will spread some 10 experimental troupes in
New York from April 24 to May 6.
</P>
<P>
   Final programs (including film screenings and panel discussions)
still have to be worked out. But the choreographers chosen by
Yorgos Loukos, the artistic director of the Lyon Opera Ballet and
of the new showcase, include Maguy Marin and Angelin Preljocaj,
both well known from previous appearances here; Jose Montalvo and
the hip-hop collective Kafig, both part of the New Europe Festival
last year; and Fred Bendongue, seen at the American Dance Festival
this summer and earlier at 651, the black arts center associated
with the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
</P>
<P>
   Making their U.S. debut will be Philippe Decoufle, a mixed-media
wizard who choreographed the ceremonies for the 1992 Winter
Olympics, complete with bungee jumpers; Joseph Nadj, who favors
Kafkaesque images; Dominique Boivin, whose solos suggest a gentle
clown; and Boris Charmatz, whose mix of brain and brawn has made
him French experimental dance's young golden boy.
</P>
<P>
   It seems only yesterday that Marin was part of the historic
debut in 1983 by five young French companies at the American Dance
Festival in Durham, N.C. _ a series of performances that revealed a
nascent modern-dance boom in a country once dominated by ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Although sent over as a group by Association Francaise d'Action
Artistique, the cultural arm of the French foreign ministry (which
is also behind ``France Moves''), the choreographers in 1983 were
unanimous on one point: They were making their U.S. debut not as
representatives of France but as themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, to place the French in a category is to do so at one's
peril. Certainly the choreographers who have emerged since 1980
have not lacked separate signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Preljocaj's work is even distinctive enough to have attracted
the ire of an American presidential candidate. Typical of his
exploration of instinct and gesture, his mesmerizing
``Annonciation'' depicted a tender encounter between the Virgin
Mary and an angel portrayed by an androgynous woman. Patrick J.
Buchanan did not see this female duet at the Joyce Theater in 1997,
but denounced it nonetheless in his syndicated column as an assault
on religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The French government, for its part, rewarded Preljocaj that
year with the Legion of Honor. Perhaps it knew more about how
religious ecstasy has been depicted in the history of art. After
all, it was a Frenchman, Charles de Brosse, who had this to say in
1739 about Bernini's famous sculpture of an angel hovering over St.
Teresa's contracted body: ``If this is divine love, I know all
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that the inspiration for experimental
choreographers in France often comes from art, literature and film.
These reference points come from a major part of their culture.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the three generations of companies that will appear
in Manhattan theaters (the Joyce, the New Victory, St. Mark's
Church, the Kitchen and Florence Gould Hall), Brooklyn (the Academy
of Music) and the Bronx (Hostos College) next spring will show a
shift in focus since Marin, the group's senior choreographer, came
to notice in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   For all their individuality, the 1983 choreographers had common
themes. ``May B,'' Marin's poignant tribute to Samuel Beckett, was
typical of a shared concern with the human condition. The 1983
choreographers ( Marin, Karine Saporta, Dominique Bagouet, Caroline
Marcade, Joelle Bouvier and Regis Obadia) were not alike. But most
had a sensibility aligned with existentialist and absurdist
theater. More often than not, their dancers failed to make
connections, fell repeatedly and were hemmed in by darkness or
closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Alienation is not entirely absent from ``France Moves.'' Nadj,
an ethnic Hungarian from Yugoslavia (think Monica Seles), will
present ``Les Veilleurs,'' inspired by Kafka, with a cast of
Hungarian-trained actors and French dancers. Expect his
hallucinatory brand of relentless nightmares. Preljocaj's new
``Paysage Apres la Bataille'' draws upon the aesthetics of Joseph
Conrad and Marcel Duchamp, a contrast that already sets up a
picture of tension between instinct and intellect.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the choreographers opt for lighter, more playful
imagery. But beneath the entertaining surface, there is a change
from a pondering of the absurd to a concern with new reality and a
celebration of cross-cultural differences.
</P>
<P>
   Modern dance in France is visibly reacting to a change in
politics and in society. France is now a multicultural country,
with an immigrant population that is the target of extreme
right-wing propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   The new theme of most choreographers today is reconciliation
within diversity. Montalvo and his co-choreographer, Dominique
Hervieu, have recruited dancers from Guadeloupe to Africa to preach
an antixenophobic message in their high-tech blend of video and
live images. Their hip-hop virtuosos, as in other troupes, are
often of North African and sub-Saharan African descent. Kafig uses
the break-dance idiom with ultimate sophistication. Bendongue
worked for many years with a hip-hop troupe. ``D'une Rive a
l'Autre,'' his new piece, is concerned with identity in a
multiracial world.
</P>
<P>
   That politics impinge directly on choreographers was obvious in
1995 when Preljocaj rejected a post at an arts center in protest
against a victory by the extreme right in nearby Toulon. Marin, who
will present a new trio, ``Pour Ainsi Dire,'' has chosen to work in
a tough immigrant suburb of Lyon.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of the choreographers are children of foreign
political exiles, it is hard to think of them as anything but
French. By extension, Decoufle, Boivin and Preljocaj have studied
in France and New York with Americans including Alwin Nikolais,
Merce Cunningham, Viola Farber, Carolyn Carlson and Douglas Dunn.
Yet their choreography does not have the formal look of American
experimental dance.
</P>
<P>
   Rooted in different experiences, these choreographers could be
compared to the painters of the School of Paris between the two
world wars: their origins are varied, and France has allowed them
to be themselves.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Texas comptroller announces budget surplus amid criticism
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By KATHY WALT
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas ended its fiscal year with $1.45 billion
in the bank, $45 million more than had been expected in July,
Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The state closed its books on the fiscal year Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Texas economy is strong, personal income is $8 billion
higher than projected and the gross state product is $25 billion
higher than projected,'' said Rylander, a Republican who has been
accused by some Democrats of ``cooking the books'' to bolster Gov.
George W. Bush's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Mario Gallegos, D-Houston, however, cautioned that
it's too soon to say whether the surplus will be enough to cover
cost overruns in some programs and growing demands on state money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things that we need to take take a look
at,'' Gallegos said, citing $610 million in cost overruns in the
state Medicaid program for the first six months of the fiscal year
and a $90 million shortfall in what the state had expected to
collect as part of its settlement with the tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   He said Rylander's announcement is akin to an individual
announcing he has ``$100 in his pocket but $200 in bills to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That don't fly until we get a true answer on how (many) bills
Texas has to pay,'' he added. ``Then the comptroller can give a
true'' accounting.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gallegos who accused Rylander of manipulating her revenue
forecasts in an effort to undermine Democratic presidential
candidate Al Gore's criticisms of Bush's spending philosophies.
Gore accused the governor of pushing tax breaks for the wealthy at
the expense of health insurance programs for children.
</P>
<P>
   While the surplus is not as large as it has been in the past
couple of years, Rylander has insisted it will more than cover
Medicaid's needs.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are predicting that lawmakers will face a tougher time
working out a budget in the 2001 session. Not only are there cost
overruns in Medicaid, but there are also new budgetary pressures to
build more prisons and bail out health insurance programs for
retired teachers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her good news about the overall surplus, Rylander
said Wednesday that she had doubled the amount of money going to
the state's so-called ``rainy day'' fund.
</P>
<P>
   The fund is a savings account created by legislators during the
1980s in the midst of a recession that forced budget cuts and huge
tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Rylander had estimated $43 million would go into that
fund, but additional natural gas severance tax collections
increased the amount to $103 million, she said.

COMMENTARY: GUARDING YOUR IDENTITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A stalker paid only $45 to an Internet research service to get
Amy Boyer's Social Security number. That supposedly private,
personal information led her former suitor to the workplace of the
20-year-old New Hampshire woman. He murdered her and killed
himself.
</P>
<P>
   That's the sort of horror story that moves officials to make a
pass at action. The Senate Appropriations Committee, at the behest
of the New Hampshire Republican Judd Gregg, sent to the floor a
bill prohibiting individuals from ``displaying to the public''
anybody's Social Security number without consent.
</P>
<P>
   His weak bill exempts ``information brokers'' that led the
stalker to his prey. But it's a start, and could be toughened by
the Democrat Fritz Hollings on the appropriations panel; that North
Carolinian has been topping John McCain's privacy protection at the
Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Over in House Ways and Means, a privacy bill with teeth in it is
sponsored by the chairman of the Social Security subcommittee,
Florida's Clay Shaw. Not only would it outlaw the sale of the
identifying number, but would brand as an ``unfair trade practice''
the withholding of services from a consumer who declines to reveal
his Social Security number.
</P>
<P>
   No longer would a merchant be able to say ``no Social Security
number, no credit _ even if you have a good credit card.'' That
number of yours has a resale value to other companies eager to
target you for dinnertime telemarketing, charitable solicitations
or employee monitoring. It is the key to the door of your identity.
As in Amy Boyer's case, professional snoops can also offer your
unique government identifier to a stalker.
</P>
<P>
   But even symbolic bills like Gregg's can open the way to
stronger protection. A law passed last year, excoriated in this
space as ``the Gramm-Summers sellout,'' allowed merged banks and
insurance companies to pass around personal data on clients and
patients without their consent. The banking lobby's triumph,
however, contained one good deed for consumers: it enabled the
Federal Trade Commission to curb the easy ``redisclosure'' of
nonpublic, personal information by what calls itself ``the lookup
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The FTC two months ago issued a rule that is enraging credit
reporting services, skip-tracing divorce lawyers and some
journalists. No longer can ``credit header'' information be bandied
about cheaply and quickly. To obtain your name and address, Social
Security and telephone number, and mother's maiden name, the buyer
of your personal information must now plunk down the money for an
entire consumer report.
</P>
<P>
   That may be meager protection, but it's drawn court challenges
from irate snoops. The willingness of the FTC chairman, Robert
Pitofsky, to withstand the wrath of the online marketers is a straw
of hope in the winds of privacy violation.
</P>
<P>
   Another straw can be seen in the envelopes you have been getting
from the Internal Revenue Service for the past couple of years: The
plastic windows showing your address are smaller. Why? It's so that
any neighbors and postal workers who may be identity thieves won't
be able to see your Social Security number without steaming open
the envelope and thereby breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
   This idea was adopted last week by the Treasury Department,
stung by harangues that Secretary Larry Summers' see-through
worship of financial transparency was adding to worries about
identity theft. ``By removing Social Security numbers from the
windows of the mailings of Social Security checks,'' an underling
announced proudly, ``we will help safeguard the privacy of millions
of Americans.'' That's 14 million fewer times each month that our
SSN's will not be on public display.
</P>
<P>
   I push this envelope because it shows that even bureaucrats have
begun to feel the groundswell against invasions of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   So do presidential candidates. George W. Bush was first to
specify his support of ``opt-in,'' requiring sellers to seek
informed consent of buyers before trading in personal information.
And Al Gore, standing beside Amy Boyer's parents, said, ``I will
make it a federal crime to buy or sell anyone's Social Security
number.''
</P>
<P>
   There's time before the election to see which man's party is
serious about the privacy issue. It goes into the decision mix.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the Broadway of right now, the notion seemed
irresistible: an original musical out of the pages of Dr. Seuss
that would turn Horton the Elephant and the Cat in the Hat into
theater animals.
</P>
<P>
   But one look at the characters onstage in Boston and the
creators of ``Seussical'' knew the show had identity problems.
Catherine Zuber's costumes for the eagerly anticipated production,
based on the work of one of the world's most popular children's
writers, were simply too stylized, too whimsical _ too, of all
things, Seussian.
</P>
<P>
   It was not that Zuber, a highly regarded designer in her own
right, had failed her aesthetic mandate. It was just that the
producers, authors and director of the $8.5 million production, a
show blessed with some of the best pre-Broadway buzz in years, were
worried. If taste-setting early audiences sensed too much fluff and
preciousness, would the musical be categorized _ and marginalized _
as kids' stuff?
</P>
<P>
   ``We had beautiful costumes individually, but as soon as we put
more than half a dozen out there it became such a feast for the
eyes that we lost focus on the people and the storytelling,'' said
Gary Gunas, who is producing ``Seussical'' along with such Broadway
and Hollywood powerhouses as SFX Theatrical Group, Barry and Fran
Weissler and Universal Studios. ``Catherine and the rest of us just
sort of stared up there and said, `OK, we've gone astray.'''
</P>
<P>
   So, mere days before performances were to begin late last month
for the show's Boston tryout, Zuber and her designs were out.
William Ivey Long was brought in to replace her, with the idea of
dressing the Seuss characters more realistically. Such
substitutions are not unheard of in a show's trial-and-error phase
out of town. But the last-minute turmoil was more than a struggle
over how Dr. Seuss' exotic creations should look. It reflected the
serious artistic and commercial conflicts arising ever more
frequently these days as Broadway becomes more preoccupied with the
needs of an age group that in the past it rarely catered to _
children _ while holding on for dear life to the adult audience
that has sustained it.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, George Bernard Shaw or Thornton Wilder served
as the inspiration for a season's major Broadway musical. Today,
that role has shifted to the likes of Disney cartoon animators _
and the creator of ``Green Eggs and Ham.'' From the New Amsterdam
Theater on 42nd Street, where ``The Lion King'' reigns as the
biggest Broadway hit in years, to the Royal National Theater in
London, where ``Honk!,'' a show based on ``The Ugly Duckling,''
snared the Olivier Award for best musical this year, it is the
fantasy world of the youngest theatergoers that has captured the
imagination of the conceptualizers and bankrollers of lavish
entertainments.
</P>
<P>
   The evolution can be traced through shows like ``Cats.'' When it
began life on Broadway 18 years ago, it was touted as an innovative
grown-up musical. But over the years, the marketing seemed to
shift. Where once the show's dominant image was of that lithe
dancer framed by a pair of cat's eyes, the television commercials
became filled with the images of children having their faces
painted to resemble the characters onstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a child in the suburbs of New York, the big event
was to go to the theater and see the thing that all the adults were
excited about,'' said Leonard Marcus, a children's book historian
and critic. ``I went to see `My Fair Lady' and `The Music Man' and
`Bye Bye Birdie': That's a reflection of how child-adult
relationships were in those days. These days, there's a lot more
interest in what the child wants to do. Doing things for the
child's sake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Seussical,'' scheduled to open Nov. 9 at the Richard Rodgers
Theater, was clearly created with the hope of tapping into the
changing demographics of Broadway, a shift mainly brought about by
three factors: The culture's obsession with youth, a nostalgia
craze among baby boomers with children and an appetite for pricier
family entertainment fueled by the robust economy.
</P>
<P>
   But in engaging such known Broadway quantities as the lyricist
Lynn Ahrens, the composer Stephen Flaherty and the director Frank
Galati, all of ``Ragtime'' fame, along with the choreographer
Kathleen Marshall (``Kiss Me, Kate''), the producers of
``Seussical'' found themselves faced with a difficult question:
Could an ambitious show that tells the story of an elephant who
hatches an egg and a microscopic boy who lives on a speck of dust
and a homely bird who just wants to be loved add up to something
that grown-ups would buy tickets to, even if they didn't have
children?
</P>
<P>
   Barry Weissler, a co-producer of ``Chicago'' and ``Annie Get
Your Gun,'' joined the production team with his wife after he saw a
workshop version last summer in Toronto that witnesses report had
many a hard-bitten producing type in tears. Weissler said the
success or failure of ``Seussical'' at overcoming preconceptions of
how adult a show about Seuss could possibly be might be the
ultimate test of its theatrical power.
</P>
<P>
   The magic numbers, say the producers of ``Seussical,'' are 7 and
77. That is the age range they are seeking to attract; indeed, it
is the range they believe they have to draw to approach the success
of the show that radically changed perceptions of children's
musical theater, ``The Lion King.'' With its heart-stopping masks
and visual effects, overseen by the avant-garde theater director
Julie Taymor, on whom the Walt Disney Co. took a chance, ``The Lion
King'' demonstrated that a big, commercial family show could have
artistic aspirations: That it could be more than a cartoon with
Equity actors cast as dessert plates (Disney's ``Beauty and the
Beast'') or the kind of clunky spectacle doomed to be made sport of
by critics (Frank Wildhorn's ``Jekyll and Hyde'').
</P>
<P>
   The powers behind ``Seussical'' believe that some of its
strengths _ a melodic Ahrens-Flaherty score; an emotional
narrative; a potential star in Kevin Chamberlin (a Tony nominee
last season for his role in ``Dirty Blonde''), who plays the
hapless Horton _ make it a worthy example of old-style Broadway
values, and thus perhaps an even likelier candidate than ``The Lion
King'' for crossover appeal. Though Taymor's production received
generally glowing notices, some critics, like Ben Brantley of The
New York Times, pointed to the show's weaker elements _ for
example, a book that seemed undramatic and characters that were
essentially opaque.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``Seussical'' strives to be unlike ``The Lion King''
everywhere but at the box office. ``We are a different animal,''
Weissler said, the pun unintentional. ``Julie Taymor is a genius at
what she does with masks and costumes. But that's the opposite of
what we're doing. That's why the costumes had to go. Because they
weren't allowing us to be the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks ago, in a fourth-floor studio at 890 Broadway,
rehearsal central for musical theater in New York, Galati and
Marshall watched as the company ran through the ensemble number
``Here on Who.'' Whoville is an important destination in the nearly
sung-through ``Seussical.'' The inhabitants of ``the tiniest planet
in the sky'' are beset by war and environmental disaster: Some of
the books by Dr. Seuss, aka Theodor Geisel, are virtual parables of
modern human perils. But the most affecting problem facing the Whos
is that no one knows they are alive.
</P>
<P>
   When the number was over, Galati seemed pleased. ``There's no
sense of cartoon,'' he told the company, and he meant it as a
compliment. ``It's absolutely real and specific. Just as long as it
stays that way, the arc of the number will work.''
</P>
<P>
   That adult sensibility is intended to inform every movement. For
example, when the denizens of Who, hoping that Horton will protect
their little planet, end their serenade of him with ``We're tiny
little people/ Saying thanks in advance,'' Marshall devised a
tip-o'-the-hat gesture on ``thanks in advance'' that is an homage
to Broadway choruses of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like any good theater, the theme reveals itself,'' she said.
``The universality comes from the specifics.''
</P>
<P>
   The interwoven tales of ``Seussical'' amount to a musical
convention of Seuss characters, presided over by the Cat in the Hat
(played by David Shiner, half the mime team of ``Fool Moon,'' in
his first professional speaking role). It is Horton alone, as the
famous story goes, who hears the Whos, and in particular one of the
littlest Whos, a boy named JoJo Andrew Keenan-Bolger and Anthony
Blair Hall alternate in the role) with a vivid imagination and a
feeling of being all alone in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   It becomes Horton's humanitarian (elephantarian?) mission to
have their innocent voices heard in the brutally cynical Jungle of
Nool, where Horton himself is an outcast, a lonely figure of fun.
He too has his blind spots, though; he is oblivious to the
attentions of Gertrude McFuzz (Janine LaManna), a sorry-looking
bird with only one pathetic tail feather.
</P>
<P>
   With its deep investment in the rhyming nonsense of Seussian
language _ ``Think a Trip on a Ship/ To the Vipper of Vipp/ Or to
Solla Sollew,'' the cast sings in the opening, ``Oh, the Thinks You
Can Think!'' _ the musical is a manifesto on the liberation of the
mind. It is also about the dignity of individual expression, the
struggle to be noticed _ and accepted _ for who you are.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really been Lynn's and my vision of Dr. Seuss,'' said
Flaherty, who has been writing musicals with Ahrens for nearly 20
years. In addition to ``Ragtime,'' their Broadway collaborations
include ``My Favorite Year'' and ``Once on This Island.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stephen forced me to read the books,'' Ahrens added. ``The
little Whos are like Earth: We're adrift, looking to save
ourselves. We tried to be truthful to the innocent anarchy in the
books. There is a deep concern in them for the planet, for human
beings and how we should behave toward one another, and it plays
out in all this zany stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The songwriting team was recruited for the project by Livent,
the Canadian theatrical production house founded by Garth
Drabinsky, which produced ``Ragtime'' and obtained the rights to
the Seuss anthology from Geisel's widow, Audrey. Following
Drabinsky's dismissal after questions about Livent's bookkeeping
practices, the shepherding of ``Seussical'' became the
responsibility of SFX, the entertainment giant that had acquired
Livent. Signing on as co-producers were Universal _ which is
bringing out a big-screen version of ``How the Grinch Stole
Christmas starring Jim Carrey, scheduled to open the week after
``Seussical'' _ and the Weisslers.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Eric Idle, a member of the Monty Python comedy team,
was to write the book, but he dropped out well before last summer's
Toronto workshop, the event that kicked ``Seussical'' into high
gear. Even Audrey Geisel was there. ``I was completely
captivated,'' Geisel said in a recent interview. ``And if I had to
be narrowed to one single word about the production it would have
to be `seamless.''' Though she had been wooed ``many, many times''
for the rights to musicalize her husband's works, she said, what
persuaded her to yield on this occasion was the run-the-gamut
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one had ever hit on that bouquet of all the characters, and
said `I want to take all of them,''' she continued. ``And before,
none of it was enchanting enough that I wanted to give the critters
up.''
</P>
<P>
   From that successful workshop, many actors were retained for
Broadway. None are household names, but the most troubling loss was
that of Andrea Martin, who won a Tony Award for ``My Favorite
Year'' and was to play the Cat in the Hat, until she decided, the
producers said, that she could not be away from her family in
California for the length of a Broadway run. It was then that the
producers approached Shiner, whose skills as a clown with a mean
streak were thought to encompass just the sort of danger required
for the major-domo-like role of the Cat.
</P>
<P>
   Even more dangerously, though, the Cat in the Hat is ubiquitous
in ``Seussical,'' assuming various personalities, commenting on the
action and, gulp, singing his heart out. And Shiner has absolutely
no professional experience in a musical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never sung a note onstage in my life,'' he said. In fact,
the thought of singing for the cast, let alone an audience,
terrified him. ``I just kept getting in a room and singing and
singing and singing until I started feeling comfortable with it,''
Shiner added. ``I started taking voice lessons, learning ways to
deepen my voice and to relax, and I slowly discovered that my voice
wasn't that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Shiner has become the embodiment of the show's
attempt to defy expectations, the clown who is not just for
children in a musical that is not meant just for them, either.
</P>
<P>
   What he and everyone else associated with ``Seussical'' are
banking on is Dr. Seuss' uncommon common touch. ``The essence of
this piece is very universal and it connects in a deeply emotional
way,'' Shiner said. ``Horton and JoJo sing of being alone in the
universe, of the notion that `I have wings and I can fly.' There is
a part of everyone that feels alone _ and the feeling we all have
of something in us that is much, much deeper, that feeling that we
can fly.''

WILLIAM MORRIS' ROBERT GOTTLIEB DEPARTS AGENCY _ WITH CLIENTS IN
TOW 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert Gottlieb, one of the most powerful agents in
book publishing, resigned as head of the William Morris agency's
New York literary group to start his own agency and multimedia
management company, a blow to the venerable William Morris agency's
presence in the book business.
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb's jump is also a sign of the strains on agents'
traditional roles as more agents and managers seek to participate
in lucrative deals to produce their clients work for other media,
like film and television. In fact, by opening the possibility of
producing projects based on his clients work, Gottlieb is
apparently reversing his own recent disparaging statements that
such managers were ``neither fish nor fowl,'' creating a potential
conflict of interest by representing authors to negotiate some
contracts while sitting across the table from their clients to sign
deals for other media.
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb, 46, began his career at William Morris 24 years ago in
the mail room and now represents a roster of blockbuster writers
including Dean Koontz, Deepak Chopra, Elizabeth George, Catherine
Coulter and Janet Evanovich. In recent months, Gottlieb clashed
with James Wiatt, the former vice chairman of International
Creative Management who took over last year as president and
co-chief executive of William Morris, but both sides said Wednesday
that Gottlieb's departure was unrelated to their personal
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb's move had been in the works for at least eight months
according to people involved, and his new company, Trident Media
Group, has already furnished and occupied its office on Madison
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some time, I have been planning on starting an agency that
is not simply devoted to selling rights or selling authors
manuscripts, but really is a business founded on an understanding
the world of intellectual property rights, branding and managing
across a variety of platforms,'' Gottlieb said.
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb said that his new company will represent clients in
film, television, Internet and museum exhibition deals as well as
books. The new firm will receive a commission on some deals it
negotiates, but may participate as producer and partner on other
deals, he said. ``That is part of the entrepreneurial
proposition,'' he said, ``There are no closed doors, no borders.''
Gottlieb said that his clients would be represented by outside
lawyers or agents when they negotiated deals with his firm.
</P>
<P>
   After his longtime client Tom Clancy recently dropped William
Morris in favor of Mike Ovitz's new talent management firm,
Gottlieb criticized Ovitz for blurring the lines between agent and
manager or producer. ``I think this is different,'' Gottlieb said.
``I am going to embrace agents, managers and laywers. I have no
intention of taking clients away from agents.''
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb will take with him an assistant, an agent and a
recently departed agent from William Morris, and, he said, his list
of more than 40 clients had agreed to follow him.
</P>
<P>
   His resignation leaves a substantial vacuum in the William
Morris agency's literary group. The firm will retain commissions
from all of the contracts Gottlieb negotiated while at the firm,
some of which extend for several books yet to be written. But his
departure leaves William Morris without another agent of Gottlieb's
stature. Among its biggest agents are Owen Laster, head of its
worldwide literary group, and Joni Evans, former publisher of
Random House's adult trade division, who joined William Morris
seven years ago but has not established a client list nearly
comparable to Gottlieb's.
</P>
<P>
   Losing Gottlieb ``is a big bump,'' said Laster, 61, who once
employed Gottlieb as his assistant. ``We will have to do some
rebuilding, I can't deny that.''
</P>
<P>
   Among its best-selling authors remaining are Judy Blume, Susan
Isaacs and Peggy Noonan, Laster said.
</P>
<P>
   William Morris, one of the largest talent agencies, retains
operations in extensive film, music and television businesses.

 &HT;    South Carolinians returning for battle with Gamecocks
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia defensive tackle Richard Seymour grew up
in Gadsden, S.C., about 15 miles from the University of South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Seymour was a Clemson fan, he attended several South
Carolina football games. But Seymour quit making the short trips to
Columbia during his senior season at Lower Richland High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Carolina stopped recruiting me,'' Seymour said.
``Georgia, Clemson and Tennessee were recruiting me, but South
Carolina stopped. They didn't recruit a lot of good players.''
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina coach Lou Holtz probably wishes the Gamecocks'
previous coaching staff had kept Seymour at home. In Georgia's SEC
opener at South Carolina on Saturday, Seymour will be one of three
Bulldog starters returning to their native state.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia guard Kevin Breedlove and receiver Durrell Robinson also
left South Carolina when they signed with the Bulldogs two years
ago. A fourth South Carolina native, tight end Ben Watson from Rock
Hill, transferred from Duke to Georgia this year.
</P>
<P>
   Breedlove, from Daniel High School in Clemson, started 12 games
at right guard for Georgia last season and was named a freshman
All-American. Robinson sat out last season as a
</P>
<P>
   partial-qualifier, but the first catch of his career was for a
touchdown Saturday against Georgia Southern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know what it is,'' said Robinson, from Byrnes
High School in Lyman. ``A lot of playersa go somewhere else. I
guess they just want to leave home.''
</P>
<P>
   Seymour didn't have much of a choice, according to his high
school coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``During his senior season, South Carolina didn't come into the
building,'' Lower Richland High coach David Moore said. ``It
probably would have been a 10-minute drive to see him play. The
story from South Carolina was that they thought he was too slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had told Georgia's coaches that it was going to be between
them and South Carolina, because that's where I thought his dad
wanted him to go,'' Moore said. ``But South Carolina didn't even
invite him over for a senior visit. I think sometimes they took it
for granted that they were going to get the in-state kids.''
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina's futility on the field _ the Gamecocks broke the
nation's longest losing streak at 21 games with a victory last week
_ certainly didn't help its recruiting efforts. Under Brad Scott,
the Gamecocks lost their final 10 games in 1998. Scott was fired
that season, and Holtz was lured out of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Holtz, who won a national championship at Notre Dame in
1988, could persuade Breedlove or Robinson to play for the
Gamecocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Holtz tried to convince me to come there, but I'd
already made up my mind,'' Robinson said. ``I already knew that I
was going to Georgia or Tennessee. I wanted to get away from
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of those recruiting wars, the Georgia-South Carolina
series has become one of the better rivalries in the SEC. The
Gamecocks have 14 players from Georgia, including starting kicker
Reid Bethea (Dublin), defensive end Kalimba Edwards (East Point),
guard Phillip Jones (Snellville) and linebacker Shannon Wadley
(Swainsboro).
</P>
<P>
   Holtz, in his second season at South Carolina, concedes that his
program has lost most head-to-head battles with the Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that until you beat Georgia and Tennessee, you
aren't going to get the athletes that keep matriculating to those
schools,'' Holtz said. ``And you're not going to beat those schools
until you keep those athletes in-state.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gamecocks have managed to keep a handful of the top recruits
from South Carolina. Defensive end John Abraham, selected in the
first round of April's NFL Draft, was a native of Timmonsville.
Current Gamecocks running back Derek Watson, from Williamston, was
recruited by Georgia, Clemson and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   But until the Gamecocks keep players like Breedlove, Robinson
and Seymour at home, Holtz says, it will be difficult to catch the
Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's all said and done,'' Seymour said, ``I want to tell
my kids that I beat South Carolina four years in a row.''

 &HT;    Motorola promotes two in the semiconductor division
 &HT;    By John Pletz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Motorola Inc. looked inside to two company
veterans Wednesday to lead its semiconductor business, which is
headquartered in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Shlapak, 56, who was the No. 2 executive in Motorola's chip
business, replaces Hector Ruiz, who left in January to become
president of rival Advanced Micro Devices, as division president.
Bill Walker, 57, the longtime head of Motorola's worldwide
chip-manufacturing operations, becomes general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Interim president Fred Tucker returns to Motorola's Schaumburg,
Ill., headquarters as deputy to the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Both Shlapak and Walker are described as hard-driving,
blunt-talking executives who face an organization that is
struggling somewhat to define itself and its future.
</P>
<P>
   Shlapak, an electrical engineer who joined the company in 1970
in Canada, is known for speaking his mind in a loud, clear voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will be able to hear us all the way out to Loop 360'' from
Motorola's Oak Hill campus near Hwy. 290 and William Cannon Drive,
Shlapak joked.
</P>
<P>
   But he predicted that he and Walker, who joined the company in
1968 and oversaw 38 factories in nine countries in his previous
job, will get along well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill will run the operations on a day-to-day basis,'' Shlapak
said.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola's semiconductor business _ which creates chips for
everything from Apple Computer Inc.'s G4 desktop to General Motors
Corp.'s automobiles _ has about one-third of its workers in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Although the semiconductor division accounted for about 22
percent of the parent company's $33.1 billion in revenue last year,
it went through two painful restructurings during Ruiz's three-year
tenure. The business was downsized with layoffs and buyouts to
about 33,000 from 50,000 workers worldwide, and some parts were
sold.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola remains the No. 1 maker of microcontrollers, more
commonly known as embedded chips. But while the semiconductor
industry has enjoyed a boom recently, Motorola hasn't ``quite kept
up with the industry,'' said Fred Zieber, an analyst who follows
the industry for Pathfinder Research in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola's chip revenue was up 27 percent last year, compared to
44 percent for the industry overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not grown as fast as the industry has recently, but we
have improved our profit position from quarter to quarter,''
Shlapak said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Many have questioned whether Motorola might someday sell its
semiconductor business. Chris Galvin, Motorola's chief executive,
said earlier this year that semiconductors remain central to the
company's overall strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this question on the outside of where they're
going,'' Zieber said. ``The fact that those kinds of questions come
up are indicative of the fact that people are having a hard time
getting their arms around what Motorola is or isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   It's taken a toll on the work force as well. Motorola has lost
some valuable talent to competitors recently in a very tight labor
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is going after everyone in terms of talent,'' said
Kim Butler, a recruiting executive with Greywolf Consulting.
``Motorola has had some real difficulties in that arena. They're
very much vulnerable on the talent side.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Matas, an analyst with IC Insights in Scottsdale, Ariz.,
said another challenge for Motorola is that growth in demand for
chips in cellular phones is expected to drop from historic rates of
about 60 percent annually during the last five years to 20 to 30
percent this year and the next.
</P>
<P>
   The new management team acknowledged the challenges that lay
ahead Wednesday. But Shlapak said both he and Walker have been
around the industry and the company a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of scars on our backs,'' he said. ``We know what
it takes to win. If we have to shake it up, we will shake it up. We
want results, and we know what we want.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go out there and set an expectation and hold people
accountable,'' Walker added. ``We have the knowhow ... to get the
job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler doesn't dispute the notion: ``You look up hardball in the
dictionary, and there is a picture of Bill Walker.''
</P>

   SONGS OF WOE: After years out of the spotlight, outlaw country
singer-songwriter David Allan Coe is cool again, thanks to an
opening slot on Kid Rock's current tour and a shout-out on the
rapper's hit single ''American Bad A--.'' But The New York Times
reports that Coe's decision to re-release two widely bootlegged
early-'80s albums _ originally sold through biker magazines while
Coe was riding with a motorcycle gang, and generally considered to
be ''among the most racist, misogynist, homophobic and obscene
songs recorded by a popular songwriter'' _ has many fans wondering
how Rock, ''who has collaborated with black rappers and has made a
living through appropriating their music, can be touring with a
songwriter responsible for blatantly anti-black material.'' Coe is
selling the albums through his so-so Web site,
officialdavidallancoe.com, as a single-CD set, for $45, although he
refuses to put his name on the disc or its packaging.

REDS TOP METS AS BENITEZ'S BEST IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Armando Benitez throws heat. Every hitter knows it,
and every hitter has to expect it. When the New York Mets' closer
came into the game with the bases loaded and one out in the eighth
inning Wednesday, protecting a one-run lead, he had to throw the
fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real tough situation coming in with the bases loaded
and one out,'' Benitez said. ``You have to come in with your best
pitch. You don't want to throw a couple of pitches and make a
mistake. He looked for the pitch he wanted. He had to look for my
best pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Benitez tried to throw his fastball outside. But it came in high
over the middle of the plate, and Benito Santiago belted it over
the fence in left-center field for a grand slam, the crushing blow
in an 11-8 comeback victory for the Cincinnati Reds at Cinergy
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez, who had allowed one earned run in his previous 31
outings, was philosophical. ``Sometimes we're human, no?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the human frailties are showing up at the same time on the
roster. The Mets limped home having lost 5 of 6 games on a road
trip that began Sept. 1, a date that has heralded doom for the team
three years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   They missed the playoffs by losing their last five games in
1998. They dropped seven in a row late last season before returning
from the brink of elimination. Now this. The Mets are taking
comfort in the standings: Before Wednesday night's game in Atlanta
between the Braves and the Diamondbacks, the Mets had a 4 1/2 game
lead over Arizona in the National League wild-card race and trailed
Atlanta by a game and a half in the National League East.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the guys will shake it off fine,'' said Mets manager
Bobby Valentine. ``We've got plenty of games left to play, and
we're still sitting OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby J. Jones, who started Wednesday's game and could not get
an out in the third, agreed. ``The good thing is we've still got a
good lead in the wild card, and we're right there in reach of the
Braves,'' Jones said. ``Sure, it's a disappointing road trip, and
every team has streaks like this. But we were right in all these
games.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, that made this trip harder to take. Matt Franco hit a
three-run homer in the first inning and Todd Pratt homered in the
second, but Jones could not hold a 5-2 lead. Bobby M. Jones
relieved with four one-hit, shutout innings after the Reds tied the
game, 5-5, but the Mets led by 8-5 before the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a slow game, a bad start for both teams, but we had
the opportunity to put them away, and we let up,'' said Lenny
Harris, who started at first base. ``We didn't put them away like
we're supposed to, like we did last month when we were putting
teams away. We just have to get that fire back, and hopefully we'll
get it down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   After Bobby M. Jones' outstanding effort, in which he changed
speeds effectively with a sinking, turnover fastball he had never
thrown with confidence before, Dennis Cook pitched a scoreless
seventh. Turk Wendell came on in the eighth and got one out, but he
allowed two singles and Valentine called for John Franco.
</P>
<P>
   Franco missed two weeks with a sore pectoral muscle before
returning on Tuesday, and he felt no discomfort Wednesday. He said
he had good pop on his fastball and a better change-up, but he
missed his spots and the Reds took advantage. Sean Casey and Dmitri
Young singled, cutting the Mets' lead to 8-7 and bringing in
Benitez.
</P>
<P>
   When Benitez allowed the slam, Franco was charged with three
earned runs, the first he has given up since June 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's been automatic all year,'' Franco said of Benitez.
``He comes in and gives up a home run _ big deal. It's a big deal
we lost, yeah, but he's been so automatic all year. He made a
mistake. It's not going to be the first time. It's not going to be
the last time.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, so many Mets are making mistakes in unison. Even
in the Mets' lone victory on this trip, they did not hit much. Todd
Zeile's game-winning homer in the 10th on Tuesday followed five
hitless innings, and the Mets managed just six hits Wednesday.
Since whacking Arizona's Randy Johnson in a 13-3 victory on Aug.
25, the Mets are hitting .193.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets do not play Thursday, and on Friday they open a
six-game homestand against Philadelphia and Milwaukee. Some players
said the off day is a good thing. ``The day off is going to be very
important,'' Alfonzo said. Others are not sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to hurt watching baseball tomorrow,'' said Pratt,
who said he may check out the game between the Braves and the
Diamondbacks, ``knowing we had a bad road trip and not being able
to do anything until Friday.''

<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Unveiling a book-length plan that hinges on
optimistic fiscal forecasts, Vice President Al Gore offered his
economic vision for the future Wednesday, painting an image of a
prosperous middle class that enjoys higher income, with more home
ownership, more high-tech jobs and more people going to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``My cause is hard-working, middle-class families,'' he asserted
at the beginning of his speech Wednesday here at Cleveland State
University.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Gore outlined a series of social and economic
goals that he said were attainable given the nation's current
prosperity, and he presented a mountain of supportable detail that
his campaign hopes will make Gov. George W. Bush's financial plan
pale by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   The speech reflected a shift in language and approach for Gore,
who has supplanted the ``working families'' he courted so
assiduously during the Democratic National Convention last month
with ``middle-class'' families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gore-Lieberman economic plan has one guiding purpose: to
help the middle-class families who have always been America's
purpose and pride, the people who pay the taxes, bear the burdens
and live the American dream,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   In his convention speech, which was 52 minutes long, Gore used
the phrase ``working families'' nine times. In Wednesday's speech,
which was 22 minutes long, he used the phrase ``middle-class'' 12
times and the phrase ``working families'' only once.
</P>
<P>
   The release of Gore's economic blueprint reignited a debate with
Bush over who would best manage the projected budget surplus over
the next decade without ruining the economy. And Bush wasted little
time Wednesday attacking Gore's plan, saying the vice president had
made so many spending promises that a Gore administration would
devour the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   To deflect such perceptions, Gore included in his 191-page plan
a pledge to set aside $300 billion as a hedge against overly
optimistic fiscal projections. Aside from the rainy day fund,
Gore's plan is largely a synthesis of many specific programs he has
described over the last several months. But Wednesday was the first
time the vice president had drawn all of these stray threads
together into a broader theme.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his 10 goals were to: eliminate the debt by 2012;
protect the Social Security and Medicare surpluses; double the
number of families that have more than $50,000 in savings; reduce
income taxes on the typical family to the lowest level in 50 years;
raise family income by a third over the next decade; enable seven
in 10 families to own their own homes; increase the number of
people who go to college; reduce poverty to below 10 percent for
the first time since poverty statistics were kept in 1959; cut the
gap between wages earned by men and women; and create 10 million
new high-tech jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Some aspects of the plan beget others. For example, eliminating
the debt by 2012 would reduce interest rates and thus make school
loans more affordable so that more people could attend college.
</P>
<P>
   The economic blueprint that Gore offered Wednesday is a road map
of middle-class life. It envisions expanded income in continuing
boom times, with more people going to college and working in
well-paying, high-tech jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's focus on the middle class is something of a turn away
from the more combative populist language that has preoccupied him
for weeks. It also reflects in part the arrival of a new pollster,
Stanley Greenberg, who has written extensively about the middle
class and helped Bill Clinton capture that broad middle swatch of
voters in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers said he deliberately used the phrase ``middle
class'' in Wednesday's speech because he was also talking about
reducing the number of people in poverty and wanted to distinguish
between the two.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president has been using the ``middle class'' in
speeches for days now, and has been losing ``working families.''
The blueprint he released Wednesday was titled ``Prosperity for
America's Families.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster who at one time advised Newt
Gingrich, the former House speaker, on word choice and language,
said that Gore appeared to have moved deliberately away from
``working families'' to the ``middle class'' to broaden his reach.
He said that voters perceived ``working families'' as applying to
young couples and excluding people who were retired or about to
retire _ a huge block of voters who are especially important
because they tend to go to the polls in larger numbers than younger
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battleground in this election is for the 30-somethings and
the near-retirees,'' Luntz said. As a result, he said, based on his
work conducting focus groups with voters for MSNBC, the phrase
``working families'' was working against Gore, not only with its
connotations of youth but its connotations of class distinctions
that Americans are loathe to acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, particularly the desire to raise family income by
one-third over the next decade, assumes an annual growth rate in
incomes of 2.9 percent _ a fairly ambitious goal, given that Gore
budget advisers even acknowledged that the country has never
sustained such growth over a 10-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told his audience to ``read my plan,'' a pointed reference
to the infamous command by former President George Bush, father of
the Republican nominee, to ``read my lips: no new taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My plan wasn't built on cross-your-fingers economics that says
we can give more to the people who already have the most and then
just hope the benefits trickle down to the middle class,'' Gore
said, again contrasting himself with the Reagan-Bush era.
</P>
<P>
   And in an effort to demonstrate that his approach was fiscally
conservative, Gore said he would set aside $300 billion in a
rainy-day fund, a hedge against overly optimistic surplus
projections.
</P>
<P>
   ``If today's economic forecasts fall short, this new reserve
fund will guarantee that we will not have to cut education or
health care,'' Gore said Wednesday. ``And unlike the promises made
on the other side, we won't be running deficits and endangering
America's prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reischauer, President Clinton's former director of the
Office of Management and Budget and now an analyst with the Urban
Institute, said that the plan, especially the rainy-day fund, was
``fiscally prudent and politically sound.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Gore's goals would essentially ``fall in his lap''
if the economy continued to expand, and results like that appealed
to most voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of people view themselves as middle class,''
he said. ``Those who are not in the middle class have aspirations
to be there and they view those aspirations as realistic, so you
don't offend anybody.''

U.S. JUDGE RULES AGAINST MP3.COM, SAYING COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT
`WILLFUL' 
</HEADLINE>
   By AMY HARMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ruling that the online music startup MP3.com had
willfully infringed the copyrights of Universal Music Group, a
federal judge on Wednesday ordered the company to pay potentially
crippling damages in one of the first cases to test the legal
boundaries of digital music distribution.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff in Manhattan said MP3.com must
pay $25,000 for each of the Universal compact disks included in its
My.Mp3.com service, which let users listen to music from any
computer connected to the Internet after indicating that they
possessed the CD or had purchased it through an online vendor
associated with the company.
</P>
<P>
   The number was less than the $45,000 per-CD that Universal's
lawyers had requested, but an MP3.com lawyer had argued that
anything more than a $500 per-CD penalty would be a virtual ``death
sentence'' for the company.
</P>
<P>
   The number of CDs copied is in dispute. But depending on how
many copyrights MP3.com is found to have infringed, total damages
could reach as high as $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have to pay numbers near that it would be
devastating,'' said Heath Terry, an analyst at Credit Suisse First
Boston. ``But now we go into more negotiations and an appeal.
Basically it stretches out the timeline on all of this, so instead
of being able to come to a resolution they're plunged into more
litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Another phase of the trial in November will determine the number
of CDs involved. Universal has said between 5,000 and 10,000
copyrights are at issue. MP3.com's lawyers have set the number at
4,740, but said they plan to challenge the eligibility of virtually
all of Universal's copyright registrations.
</P>
<P>
   With about $300 million in cash, some of which has been
earmarked to settle with the four other major record companies
originally involved in the lawsuit, analysts said MP3.com should be
able to stay afloat if it managed to keep the damages payment in
the $100 million range. The other companies _ Sony Music, Time
Warner, the EMI Group and Bertelsmann AG _ did not reveal the
settlement amounts, but analysts estimated that MP3.com settled for
$20 million with each company. A group of music publishers have
also filed suit against the company.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The trial has been closely watched by many companies seeking to
stake a claim in the potentially lucrative arena of Internet music
distribution, including Napster, the online music trading service
that is facing its own lawsuit brought by the major record labels.
In July, a federal judge ordered Napster to stop helping computer
users trade copyrighted music over the Internet. The ruling was
later stayed pending appeal.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In determining the level of damages, Rakoff said he chose a
number considerably lower than the maximum penalty of $150,000 per
infringement because Universal had not specified how it lost money
because of MP3.com's actions, even though it could have done so. He
also said MP3.com had acted more responsibly than other Internet
startups.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge said he balanced that against the need to deter
other Internet companies from copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some companies operating in the area of the Internet may have
a misconception that, because their technology is somewhat novel,
they are somehow immune from the ordinary applications of laws of
the United States, including copyright law,'' Rakoff said. ``They
need to understand that the law's domain knows no such limits.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of MP3.com fell in after-hours trading. MP3.com shares
last traded at $5-7/8 on the Instinet electronic trading system,
down $2 from where it last traded before being halted, pending the
ruling announcement, at around 2 p.m. on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Robertson, MP3.com's chief executive, said the company
would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We built technology that lets people listen to their own CD
collections,'' Robertson told reporters in Rakoff's courtroom
Wednesday afternoon. ``We think the law needs to accommodate
consumers' need to listen to their own CD collections online in a
digital form.''
</P>
<P>
   The law currently allows consumers to be able to store their
music online and listen to it anywhere after those individuals copy
their own CDs in a somewhat onerous process known as ``ripping,''
and upload them to a virtual storage locker provided by companies
like Myplay, an MP3.com rival.
</P>
<P>
   To make its My.MP3.com service easier to use, MP3.com did not
require users to load their own music into an on-line locker.
Rather, a user had merely to insert a CD into the CD-ROM drive of a
computer and log into MP3.com's Web site, at which point MP3.com
would automatically put a copy of the music into the person's
virtual locker. A user could also purchase a CD from an on-line
retailer and listen to it immediately once MP3.com had confirmed
the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The company suspended the service after Rakoff ruled in April
that it had violated the copyrights of the major record labels by
compiling a database of about 80,000 CDs.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com hoped to attract advertisers with the service and
eventually charge a subscription fee. The company argued that the
service was legal under the ``fair use'' doctrine of copyright law.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After MP3.com settled with the other four companies, Universal,
a unit of the Seagram Co. and the largest of the five major
companies, remained as a plaintiff.
</P>
<P>
   A Universal spokesman said Wednesday that the company would have
no comment because of the pending litigation. Cary Sherman, general
counsel of the Recording Industry Association of America, a trade
group representing the major labels, said in a statement that the
group was pleased with the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should send a message that there are consequences when a
business recklessly disregards the copyright law,'' Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   In an appeal, MP3.com will no doubt have to address Rakoff's
initial determination that its fair use defense was, as he
reiterated yesterday ``without any merit.'' In his ruling on
willfulness, the judge said that the notion that My.Mp3.com simply
enabled consumers to more easily store their own CDs was ``little
more than a sham'' because the consumers CDs were never actually
stored with MP3.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``While they camouflaged the critical differences with
broad-brush appeals to `consumer rights,' they were in fact never
in any doubt that this purported justification for their otherwise
obvious copyright infringement rested on a doubtful factual
premise,'' the judge said.

U.S. AND EUROPEANS RAISING THE STAKES IN TRADE IMPASSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The European Union and the United States are holding
fast in several trade disputes, their continued standoff
threatening a more punishing confrontation between the two trading
blocs, the world's biggest.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union has rejected the United States' attempt to
overhaul a tax benefit that saves American companies millions of
dollars a year. The move comes at a time when Washington is drawing
up a list of more than $300 million in tariffs on European goods,
mainly food, after the Europeans refused to alter their
restrictions on banana imports and on hormone-treated beef.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a panel of the World Trade Organization,
which is based here, ruled that the United States must change a law
that allowed companies _ including General Motors, Microsoft and
Boeing _ to avoid paying taxes on some overseas sales by channeling
them through offshore subsidiaries. Under the trade organization's
rules, the United States has until Oct. 1 to revise the law, which
the panel called an illegal export subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter made public late last week, the European Union's
trade commissioner, Pascal Lamy, said that American changes still
retain export subsidies in violation of WTO rules, and allow the
subsidies to be continued beyond the October deadline. ``The only
way for a U.S.-based manufacturer to benefit from the new regime is
by exporting,'' said a European Union summary of the letter to
Stuart Eizenstat, the American deputy secretary of the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   An attempt in May to reach a compromise failed, and Eizenstat
warned in July that ``a major trade war'' could follow.
</P>
<P>
   The new system for offshore sales was approved by the House Ways
and Means Committee late in July, and awaits approval by the House
and Senate. Clinton administration officials have indicated they
intend to press for congressional approval of the modified law.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Aug. 31 letter was not made public, Lamy is said to
have indicated that the only change in the U.S. tax breaks scheme
was eliminating the requirement that a ``paper'' company be set up
offshore. About 5,000 such offshore tax havens exist, mostly based
in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the EU says it is willing to continue negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is one month before the Oct. 1 deadline, and we believe
there is still time for a solution,'' said Herve Jouanjean, a
commission official.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of a compromise, the EU is expected to seek WTO
permission to impose retaliatory sanctions on U.S. exports in
amounts that dwarf previous trade spats. Such sanctions are meant
to be based on the amount of harm suffered in the international
marketplace. Using that measure, the Europeans are likely to ask
for compensation of 100 percent tariffs on $4 billion in American
goods export to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress passes the proposed reform legislation before Oct.
1, trade experts said it was likely that the European Union would
have to file a new challenge to the law. A ruling, which is
delivered by a three-judge panel, could take months.
</P>
<P>
   In the dispute over bananas and beef, the Clinton administration
is preparing a list of European products that would be subject to
tariffs. Britain has been lobbying the administration to exempt
Scottish cashmere from the list.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union's initial effort to reform its banana import
regime, which gave preferential treatment to former European
colonies, was rebuffed by the United States as insufficient.
Brussels now is trying to get agreement internally and with its
banana exporting partners on a new alternative. The 15-country
trading bloc and the United States also remain at odds over how to
replace the European ban on hormone-treated beef, which was struck
down at the WTO. Currently, the European Union is banning one
hormone and temporarily excluding four others while scientific
studies are under way to evaluate their effect on human health. The
United States maintains that the growth-inducing hormones are safe.

of anonymity, cautioned that the talks were preliminary, and other
cigarette makers said they had no intention of settling cases.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure of the talks came as a federal judge in Brooklyn,
N.Y., issued an order Wednesday that could provide a mechanism for
reaching a global settlement of claims by smokers. The judge, Jack
Weinstein of U.S. District Court, told the parties to come to court
on Monday to consider a suggestion by plaintiffs' lawyers to spin
off claims for punitive damages against cigarette makers into a
nationwide class-action lawsuit, with separate trials for claims
for compensatory damages. Such a division would be unique.
</P>
<P>
   Punitive damages are those intended to punish a defendant for
its conduct. Plaintiffs' lawyers, in pressing for a separate
punitive damages class-action suit, are apparently seeking to play
on the tobacco companies' biggest concern.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a state court jury in Florida issued a
stunning $144.8 billion punitive award to members of a class-action
lawsuit brought on behalf of all Florida residents who had been
made sick by smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco companies have appealed the Florida verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, Weinstein, who is viewed as a judicial
activist, made a bid to create such a class action for all claims
but the tobacco companies rejected his suggestions. Spokesmen for
the nation's three biggest cigarette companies _ the Philip Morris
Cos., J.R. Reynolds Tobacco and the Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Co.
_ also criticized the latest plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no intention whatsoever of settling these lawsuits,
and we are not discussing settlement with plaintiffs' attorneys or
anyone else,''said Mark Smith, a spokesman for Brown &AMP; Williamson
Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, tobacco companies agreed to pay $246 billion to
settle a series of lawsuits brought by state attorneys general. But
that settlement did not foreclose claims by individual smokers, as
in the Florida case.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Liggett Group, the smallest of the cigarette
manufacturers, did not return two telephone calls Wednesday. But
Liggett, which broke ranks with the other companies during the
attorneys general litigation, has previously sought settlements of
litigation against it.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent interest of Lorillard Tobacco, a unit of the Loews
Corp., in settlement talks, however, comes as a surprise. Steve
Watson, a spokesman for Lorillard, said it was not company practice
to comment with regard to litigation or potential ligation.
</P>
<P>
   Given recent decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court, several legal
experts have questioned whether a nationwide settlement of all
current and future smoking claims could withstand constitutional
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Coffee, a law professor at Columbia University, said
Weinstein appointed him several months ago as adviser to help
determine ways that a national settlement could survive such
appeals.

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The question hangs out there: Why would 149
world leaders leave their not-always-stable governments unattended
to come to New York and make five-minute speeches, mostly to each
other and the television cameras from back home?
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan had an answer Wednesday as he
lifted his glass to the biggest power lunch in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``You,'' he said, looking out over the world's political elite,
``have the authority to speak for, and the ability to transform,
the lives of 6 billion people.''
</P>
<P>
   This ``millennium summit'' was a gamble, organized not to
celebrate a new page on the calendar but to look ahead at what kind
of a global society the leaders hope to achieve in this century, if
not the millennium to come.
</P>
<P>
   But from the start, everyone knew that it would go beyond that,
and would probably be remembered more for the private meetings in
hotel suites and diplomatic offices around town than for anything
said in the cavernous hall of the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   There was a kind of easy camaraderie born of the unusual event,
with back-slapping, hugs, kisses and the puzzled faces of
interpreters trying to keep up with the in-jokes.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, for one, could not resist telling President
Jiang Zemin of China, as they sat down to lunch, what a softball
interview the Chinese leader had had with CBS's ``60 Minutes.''
``Mike Wallace is so mean to us,'' Clinton complained to his
lunchtable buddies, ``and he was purring in front of  &UR; him &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   President Fidel Castro of Cuba, whose reputation for long-winded
speeches is legendary, brought laughter to the Assembly late in the
afternoon when he took out a white handkerchief and covered the
timer on the lectern. But he stayed within the allotted time _ and
waved triumphantly before retaking his seat.
</P>
<P>
   For an hour early Wednesday morning, many of the world's most
familiar faces passed by the knot of protocol officers waiting at
the canopied delegates' entrance to U.N. headquarters. As speeches
began _ they are expected to go on well into Friday evening _ the
stocktaking that emerged was not so much of the world the leaders
hoped to see, but of the stark realities out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statistics of poverty and inequality in our world are
shocking and shameful,'' said Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of
Ireland: ``Half the world's population struggling on less than $2 a
day, over half a billion on less than $1. A quarter of a billion
children of 14 and under working, sometimes in terrible conditions.
Death from preventable and treatable diseases _ 10 people will die
of malaria in the five minutes I take to address you.''
</P>
<P>
   President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria _ who shared a lunch
table with Clinton, Annan, Jiang, Prime Minister Tony Blair of
Britain, two kings and several others _ is currently chairman of
the Group of 77, a forum for developing nations. In an interview on
Monday, when Obasanjo had more than five minutes to explain what
the third world was seeking at these meetings, he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``The wishes of the developing world are simple. We are all
living in the same house, whether you are developed or not
developed. What we are saying is that some of us in this house are
living in superluxurious rooms; others are living in something not
better than an unkempt kitchen where pipes are leaking and there is
no toilet. We are saying, `Look, in the interest of all of us, let
us living in the superluxurious rooms pay a bit of attention to
those who are living where the pipes are leaking, or we'll all be
badly affected.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the message.''
</P>
<P>
   There were repeated warnings to heed the dark side of
globalization, the technology and health gaps as well as the
unbalanced use of natural resources. There were also calls for a
more democratic United Nations, with a Security Council more
reflective of a membership that has changed profoundly since the
organization's founding in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want this United Nations organization to fulfill its
lofty goals, indeed if we want it to remain relevant in the 21st
century,'' Prime Minister Said W. Musa of Belize said in his
speech, ``we must remake it into an organization that takes global
governance away from the self-appointed few and brings greater
democracy to all its operations.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of speakers took the opportunity to float their own
international initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin of Russia proposed a project in
cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency to destroy
radioactive materials and exclude them from civilian energy use. He
also suggested that the 40th anniversary next spring of the first
manned space flight _ by a Russian _ be commemorated by an
international conference on the prevention of the military uses of
space.
</P>
<P>
   Both Putin and Jiang were robbed of their biggest arms-control
target, the proposed U.S. nuclear missile defense, when Clinton
delayed deployment last week. Putin did reaffirm the importance
that Russia attaches to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty,
which many nations say would be directly threatened by a new U.S.
system.
</P>
<P>
   The angriest speaker of this first day of the summit meeting was
probably Prime Minister Lester B. Bird of Antigua, who went on the
attack against the seven industrialized nations and the larger
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development for their
efforts to tighten or close down tax havens.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``While the spin doctors of the OECD have attempted to cloak
their position in moral rectitude with references to the evils of
money laundering,'' he said, ``harmful tax competition has nothing
to do with money laundering.'' He said the campaign was a ploy by
``what amounts to a high-tax cartel'' of rich nations.
</P>
<P>
   His passion illustrated the difficulties in selling
international financial regulation to those countries that believe
they can only stand to lose when rules are tightened.
</P>
<P>
   There were some overtones of sadness and poignancy in many of
Wednesday's 60-plus speeches. Starting with Annan, there were
condemnations of the killings of three international aid workers,
and perhaps a fourth, in West Timor by rampaging Indonesian
militias. Indonesia's president, Abdurrahman Wahid, whose nation's
army and police patrol the island to prevent trouble, sat
impassively in the hall. He is scheduled to speak on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Blair called attention to the plight of Daw Aung San
Suu Kyi, the democracy leader in Myanmar, who is enduring a new
round of repression under a military junta that robbed her of an
election victory a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not wish to leave the U.N. without saying this,'' Blair
said. ``The treatment of Aung San Suu Kyi by the Burmese regime is
a disgrace. I call on the Burmese government to let her go free,
and I call on fellow world leaders to back that call.''
</P>
<P>
   It was left to President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom of the Maldives to
plumb the existential depths, as he spoke for those island nations
threatened with extinction in rising seas caused by global warming.
``When the U.N. meets to usher in yet another century,'' he said,
``will the Maldives and other low-lying nations be represented
here?''
</P>
<P>
   As his five minutes ended, he added: ``My time at the podium is
up. But I pray that that of my country is not.''

`THE BULLS NIGHT OUT': THREE COPS, RETIRED BUT YEARNING FOR
ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end of review) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cock-of-the-walk score for ``The Bulls' Night Out,''
performed by the Swing Daddies, gives the film a focus and energy
that its filmmaking lacks. (The music sounds like a
bouncing-on-the-balls-of-its-feet Las Vegas fanfare for a Sinatra
entrance at the old Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas.) The picture's
title is explained in the very first scene, when a barkeep, George
(Jack Marnell), tells a customer why the Bulls' Night Out banner
hangs in Ruby's Bar, his establishment. ``Off-duty retired cops
show ID, drink for free _ they do it once a month,'' George
explains. Satisfied, the customer downs a vodka, drops off the mail
and heads off into the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bulls' Night Out'' is an occasion for three of George's
retired friends _ Louie (Steve Kasprzak), Zap (J.J. Flash) and J.J.
(A.J. Johnson) _ to drop by and play a few games of poker while
tossing back free drinks. The film's writer and director, Lindley
Farley, set his story in 1993 and cast actors who look like retired
cops. They have heavy arms, thickening middles and faces that have
moved beyond exhausted to hardened; they look like aging rhinos
determined to show they're still entitled to keep their chests up
and do some good.
</P>
<P>
   George keeps a log of the license plates of criminals who drive
around the neighborhood, in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. The
quick-to-anger Zap wears a Hawaiian shirt that was probably his
idea of undercover back when he was, as they say on ``NYPD Blue''
(and in ``Bulls''), on the job. Louie drinks himself into an early
morning haze. J.J. has mellowed into a nine-year-old depression
after the murder of his wife and children.
</P>
<P>
   These actors tear into the material, rolling through the movie
with the pride of guys who've known exactly what they wanted to do
for their entire lives. When they inflict a little barroom justice
on a would-be robber, tricking him into revealing which hand he
favors so they can inflict a lesson upon it, you're watching actors
with years of confidence in their craft. In story terms, ``Bulls''
resembles one of the 1970s born-to-be-paperback police novels
written by Dorothy Uhnak or Robert Daley. George and his pals take
so much pride in their return to action that they begin stalking
the neighborhood drug dealers, and their vigilante actions go
tragically wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bulls'' almost looks like a movie an ex-cop would make; the
bar interior, where most of the action takes place, looks as if
it's lighted with the high beams of a police cruiser. Farley's
directing is crude, at best, with surveillance camera technique and
cuts that seem to have been made with a blowtorch. He also crams in
several space-wasting subplots, including a romance between
George's daughter, Ruby (Jayne A. Larson), and a long-haired
stereotypical bleeding heart who looks like a perp. And there's too
much of a baker (Steve Roberts), stuck in for comic relief, whose
accent and patent leather mustache seem to have come from a
correspondence course.
</P>
<P>
   But then there are the four actors playing the rusting,
impatient former cops _ especially the easygoing but brusque
Marnell (George Wall) and Johnson, whose low-boil bitterness is so
well thought out that even the speech he gives explaining himself
doesn't undermine it. (He's the weary voice of reason reacting to
Zap's racism.)
</P>
<P>
   The movie doesn't turn out to be as benignly right-wing as it
initially suggests, though the plot turns can be spotted a mile
away. As could the torch Bill that (Russ Romano), George's other
bartender, has been carrying for Ruby for years, something that
should be obvious to everyone and goes unnoticed. Maybe George and
his crew weren't such good cops after all; their observational
skills are questionable.

KINGS TO START SANS STUMPEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Kings will begin training
camp Friday without top-line center Jozef Stumpel, a restricted
free agent who is holding out while seeking a new contract with the
club.
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel, 28, earned $1.75 million last year when he scored 58
points in 57 games. But he also missed more than two months with a
groin injury that required surgery and was out for three more weeks
with an injured left knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect him and it is difficult to say when he'll be
in,'' Kings general manager Dave Taylor said Wednesday. ``It's
unfortunate because he is our first-line center and an important
member of the team. We need a healthy (Stumpel) this year and
training camp only helps that.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who last month avoided salary arbitration by reaching
agreements with centers Bryan Smolinski and Ian Laperriere, also
must address the contract status of captain Rob Blake, who will
become an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But Blake already has arrived at camp, which will be held
through the first week of October at the Kings' new training
facility. Like Mattias Norstrom, who skipped camp last year before
getting a three-year deal, Stumpel is without a contract and using
his absence as leverage.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Stumpel was the Kings' best player with club
highs in assists (59) and points (79). But he missed 43 games
during the next two seasons. When he played last year, he excelled,
leading the club with 41 assists and tying Luc Robitaille for a
team-high plus-23 rating.
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel had seven game-winning goals, including three in
overtime. During a six-game stretch from Jan. 31 to Feb. 14, he had
five goals and eight assists. The Kings went 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: Although camp does not begin until Friday, most of the
team skated Wednesday. Beginning at 7 a.m. today, the players will
undergo physicals. They also will attend meetings in the afternoon
with coach Andy Murray. . . . Forward Pavel Rosa, one of the more
popular members of the organization after scoring two goals in his
first NHL game (Dec. 17, 1998), will not be back this season. Rosa,
who spent most of last season at minor-league Long Beach, rejected
a contract offer from the club this summer and is expected to play
in Europe.

`PAGAN BABIES': SAMPLING THE LOWLIFE FOOD CHAIN WITH ELMORE
LEONARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move more apt to inspire compassion than readers'
confidence, Elmore Leonard begins his latest novel with the grim
aftermath of genocidal massacre in Rwanda. Five years earlier, 47
of the Rev. Terry Dunn's parishioners were murdered in church, and
he still lives with the memory. Dunn also lives with an
interestingly eclectic attitude toward his spiritual duties. When a
Tutsi man confesses homicidal anger toward the Hutu who killed his
family, the priest offers practical advice. `` `Walk up to the
guy,' Terry said, `and hit him in the mouth as hard as you can,
with a rock. You'll feel better.'''
</P>
<P>
   As he describes Terry's quiet, haunted life in Africa, Leonard
remains noticeably out of his element (though not nearly as far out
as when he tried working rock lyrics into ``Be Cool,'' his shaky
1999 foray into the music business). Then, 50 pages into the story,
the happily inevitable begins to happen. Circumstances force Terry
to leave Rwanda in a hurry, and he returns to what is terra firma
for this author: a Detroit filled with delusional schemers and
fabulously inept hoods. The pieces of this crime tale begin falling
into place so handily that Leonard might as well have hung a
``Virtuoso at Work'' shingle on his door.
</P>
<P>
   Terry has a brother, Fran, who knows a woman named Debbie Dewey,
who has ambitions as a stand-up comic. Debbie has been honing her
act in a women's medium-security prison, a hard place to get
laughs. The centerpiece of her act is an account of the event that
landed her behind bars. ``True story,'' Debbie tells her audience.
``I was visiting my mom in Florida and happened to run into my
ex-husband ... with a Buick Riviera.'' Pause for effect. ``It was a
rental, but it did the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Two salient things about Debbie: Terry, who raised eyebrows by
living in not-so-priestly closeness with his Rwandan housekeeper,
will be secular enough to like her style, and what she passes off
as the true story of her automotive mishap is baloney.
</P>
<P>
   The car was a Ford Escort, but she thinks Riviera sounds
classier. The ex-husband was really an ex-boyfriend, but she
changed that detail for the same reason. She didn't mention that he
conned her out of money by posing in a yachting cap and borrowing
funds for imaginary nautical supplies. She didn't hit him hard
enough, because Randy Agley (ne Aglioni) is still around. Randy is
a restaurateur who has hair like Michael Landon's, keeps a
photograph of Soupy Sales over his desk and went through a brief
phase of fashioning himself after Pierce Brosnan. Now his style
inspiration is the mob.
</P>
<P>
   When Terry meets Debbie, and when he finds himself having to
settle an old score about cigarette-smuggling charges from his
unholy days, ``Pagan Babies'' hits its cool, sustainable stride.
Leonard returns to the lean fluidity of his best work as he begins
demonstrating how a proposed Little Orphans of Rwanda Fund may just
spin off dividends for Terry and various other characters.
</P>
<P>
   The book's title, less enlightened, comes from Terry's school
days, when ``there'd be a jar in the classroom and a sign that said
FOR THE PAGAN BABIES, and we'd put change in it left from our lunch
money.'' Fund-raising methods may have changed, but the scam
artistry displayed by Leonard's latest crowd of miscreants is
timeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pagan Babies'' takes Terry seriously as a man of conscience,
despite his wily way of navigating hoodlum-infested waters and his
impressive dissembling. Thus, partly paralyzed by virtue, he
remains a neutral hero, but the book that he anchors does not lack
local color.
</P>
<P>
   As it moves entertainingly up the gangland food chain,
escalating from tax-free cigarettes to mob hits and a scam to
extort damages from Randy's restaurant, the story trots out an
irresistible array of lowlifes. Randy, in particular, is a
character actor's dream, what with the debonair manner of an ersatz
yachtsman, the pretensions of a professional host and the
paper-thin civility of a mob frontman.
</P>
<P>
   Told that he has to subsidize mob-controlled prostitutes at his
restaurant for an exorbitant fee, Randy wearily raises no-win
questions about the fairness of the deal. ``What you're telling
me,'' he tells a mob intermediary, ``the girls could all quit and
become stockbrokers, you still get your eight'' thousand ``a
week.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is at its devilish best in a scene that has Randy
interrogating Mutt, a potential hired killer who doesn't seem to
know any tricks of the trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to catch him someplace having his supper,'' says the
would-be assassin.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't mean here,'' Randy hastily replies.
</P>
<P>
   No, Mutt is imagining one of those mom-and-pop Italian
restaurants that are required for gangland assassinations in
movies. (``In the movies they're always sending to Detroit for a
hit man, like they're sitting around waiting for calls,'' Terry
remarks. ``Guy picks up the phone, `Hit man, can I help you?''')
</P>
<P>
   But Randy thinks it might be better to drive past and pop the
victim. ``You do have a car?'' he asks Mutt. No, but Mutt has a
pickup with a battery that often needs jump-starting. ``Or you
could steal a car, just for the job,'' suggests Randy. ``I
understand that's often the way it's done. You know, in case
someone gets the license number.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe. But then Mutt would need to worry about finding a
parking place. Maybe a buddy could drive him, but he doesn't have
any friends. Nor does he, unlike many more highly skilled hit men,
have a gun.
</P>
<P>
   When the terms of the shooting are worked out, Mutt has one last
question: ``But now which person was it again?''
</P>
<P>
   It will spoil none of the story's cunning, and probably surprise
no one, to learn that Terry Dunn, a k a ``the priest,'' is the
intended target. Or that Mutt, in the manner of Leonard's most
memorable small-time operators, has a practical streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's OK,'' he decides. ``I'm a Baptist.''

 &HT;    By Michele Kurtz

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ Two Houston lesbians, hoping to turn
conventional Texas thinking on its head, obtained a marriage
license Wednesday and will tie the knot next week.
</P>
<P>
   As in most states, Texas family law prohibits same-sex
marriages. These two women can legally get married, though, because
one of them was born a man.
</P>
<P>
   An opinion last year by the state 4th Court of Appeals in San
Antonio said chromosomes _ not sex-change operations or outward
gender characteristics _ determine a person's gender.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the court invalidated the marriage of a couple
because it said the woman, who had been born a man but had
undergone a sex-change operation before the marriage, was still
legally a man and therefore not legally married.
</P>
<P>
   That ruling worked in the favor of Jessica Wicks, 53, and Robin
Wicks, 44. They're thought to be the first couple living as the
same gender to be granted a marriage license in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear what impact the case might have on gay-rights
issues in Texas, but many say it will likely call attention to
same-sex marriages and thorny questions about who determines a
person's gender _ and how.
</P>
<P>
   ``It points out, partially, how ridiculous all of this is.
Marriage is a private matter,'' said Dianne Hardy-Garcia, executive
director of the Lesbian Gay Rights Lobby of Texas. ``I don't think
the state has any business defining who should be able to get
married between consenting adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Arlene Wohlgemuth, R-Burleson, the president of the Texas
Conservative Coalition, said although the case is unusual, the
group does not oppose the Wicks' wedding even though both partners
live as women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't object to a marriage license being issued since we do
favor a marriage between a man and woman and this fits the legal
definition of gender,'' Wohlgemuth said. ``They are legally a man
and a woman. What they do once they are married is up to them.''
</P>
<P>
   But other issues complicate things, said Jack Sampson, a
University of Texas law professor. Not everyone is born with a set
of chromosomes, XX or XY, that clearly defines their gender.
Hermaphrodites and other cases of confused genetics could pose
problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In its opinion, the 4th Court of Appeals said the Legislature is
a better venue for deciding gender. And some advocates for
transsexuals say they'll ask lawmakers to do that next year.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Randolph Frye, an attorney for the Wicks, said Wednesday
she'll encourage other transsexuals to travel to San Antonio and
get married. She hopes such a groundswell would give traditional
gay couples ammunition to question why they can't be wed, too.
</P>
<P>
   Frye also represents Christie Lee Littleton, who is fighting the
4th Court of Appeals' ruling which came in her wrongful death
lawsuit against a doctor who treated her husband who died in 1996.
The court threw out the suit and Littleton's marriage because
Littleton was a male by birth.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Supreme Court has twice refused to hear the case,
which is pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The Wicks met about three years ago. Jessica was born Grady
Roland Wicks and has an ``M'' on her birth certificate. About a
year ago she took steps to legally become a woman, Frye said. News
reports have said Jessica has had a sex-change operation, but she
and her attorney refuse to confirm that. They say it is irrelevant
because the 4th Court of Appeals defines gender by chromosomes, not
anatomy.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Robin changed her last name to Wicks. The
couple tried to get a marriage license in Houston but were refused
when the county clerk said Jessica was a woman. But Bexar County is
one of 32 counties where transsexual couples could argue that the
4th Court's ruling applies because the court covers those counties.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Wicks clutched their newly acquired marriage
license and the office's standard lavender ``newlywed kit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we love each other, and in a real sense we're already
married in our heart,'' Jessica Wicks said. ``But there's something
about the piece of paper that says this is the way it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Vermont, in response to a state supreme court ruling, has
legalized a sort of parallel marriage system for same-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
   Not all organizations that represent the interests of gays are
pushing to legalize same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Equal rights for gays have come a long way in the 1990s. I'm
not sure society is yet at the point of acceptance of gay
marriage,'' said Steve Labinski, president of the Log Cabin
Republicans of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Harrington, director of the Texas Civil Rights Project, said
the Wicks' case could raise the ``comfort level'' among residents
and politicians toward eventually accepting civil unions or gay
marriages. Even though the state may view the Wicks as a man and
woman, the public won't, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how you cut it, you end up with two women getting
married,'' he said. ``That's how people are going to look at it.''

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Less than two weeks after experts told the
United Nations that it needed an in-house policy center to work on
areas of tension before they turn into international crises,
President Paul Kagame of Rwanda came along Tuesday with a case in
point.
</P>
<P>
   More than six years after a frenzy of ethnic killing tore his
small African country apart, armed militia and former soldiers
thought to be guilty of some of the killings are still roaming free
in neighboring Congo. A plan to deal with them should have been
worked out long ago by U.N. officials drawing on their experience
and collective skills, Kagame said in an interview. To him, they
are the reason there is a war in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   In New York for a meeting of world leaders, Kagame said that
until the Hutu responsible for killing Tutsi and their moderate
Hutu allies are disarmed and resettled somewhere in peace, Rwandan
troops will stay in Congo. The presence of foreign troops _ from
Rwanda, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia _ is also a major
impediment to dispatching a U.N. peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.N. has enough resources and expertise _ and even
experience from other situations _ to come up with a proposal,''
Kagame said. Breaking the cycle of blame and counter-blame between
Rwanda and the Congolese government would mean separating fewer
than 10,000 Rwandans who, he said, are mixed with troops from Congo
and its allies, particularly Zimbabwe and Angola.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many ways of dealing with the problem,'' he said.
``One is working together to see that these people don't get
support from other governments. Then you can move farther and
identify where they are. Let's put them into camps and disarm them.
Let's repatriate them to Rwanda or take them elsewhere. I don't see
why the U.N. can fail to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep coming to us and asking us what we feel they should
do, but this is simply escaping the problem, trying to run away
from the problem. They come a hundred times asking the same
questions. I think they'd better get serious and do what they're
supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of exiles have returned voluntarily, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call my bluff,'' he said to those who say that Rwanda really
has designs on territory in eastern Congo. With the former Rwandan
soldiers and militias out of Congo, he said, his troops will come
home.
</P>
<P>
   Kagame said the costly business of keeping Rwandan troops in
Congo to seal the border burdens the reconstruction of Rwanda, a
country of about 7.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Rwanda, like Cambodia, will suffer for a long time
from the loss of much of its middle class in the killings. The
events of 1994 left up to 800,000 Rwandans dead and led several
months later to the overthrow of a Hutu-led government by Tutsi-led
rebels whom Kagame commanded. He has been the central power figure
in Rwanda ever since, although he did not assume the presidency
until this year after a split in his party led to the resignation
of his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   The middle-class professionals lost to Rwanda came from both
ethnic groups. Kagame said that in addition to those who were
killed, many of the 120,000 Rwandans charged in the attacks and
still in jail are also middle class: priests, civil servants, local
political leaders and sometimes teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Kagame, who has tempered the fury he first expressed at the
failure of the United Nations and its leading members, including
the United States and France, to prevent or end the massacres, now
focuses his criticism on what he sees as an international failure
to recognize that a country so profoundly wounded cannot be treated
like just any place.
</P>
<P>
   ``My country has to be treated as a special case,'' he said, and
he intends to make this a theme of his speech this week to world
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   He said Rwanda still has a long way to go toward reconciliation
and the rebuilding of government institutions that can withstand
ethnic tensions. Agriculture, education and health services are
only beginning to be restored.
</P>
<P>
   But he rejected suggestions that the Hutu majority and Tutsi
minority will never be reconciled.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been nothing in the past to demonstrate that they
can't live together,'' he said, ``but I do see a solution in the
better political management of the situation _ better political,
economic and social management of the country.''

DAVE CAMPO'S REACTION TOO MEEK, TOO WEAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You know the Dave Campo story.
</P>
<P>
   Chapter 1 was such a nice read:
</P>
<P>
   Hard-working, very competent football guy busts his butt all
those seasons, advances through the staff ranks, and then is
rewarded by the benevolent team owner with the head coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   There is initial doubt, locally and nationally, over Campo being
able to ``handle'' the many nonfootball variables that come with
the Valley Ranch territory (i.e., the Jerry factor). But through
the spring and summer, all you had to do was deal with Campo
personally, and he'd win you over. Sincerity and honesty were
prevalent. Eventually, no doubter was left unturned.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, then came Chapter 2, where the season-opening
Sunday story line switched quickly from nice to nasty:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dark and stormy night.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was 109 degrees under cloudless afternoon skies
when a hard rain of fire scorched the Texas Stadium fake earth. I
didn't research it, but it may have been the worst head-coaching
debut, all things considered, in the history of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Campo's players turned into heartless, prideless mutants. They
disgraced the new coach and themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Media-wise, Campo probably got off a little light in the
retelling of Sunday's thing. Why? Read Chapter 1 again. Blame it
also on patriotism. America would be a better place if the Campos
of our world were a success. The jock kingdom needs more good guys
and less rodents. In other words, we play favorites in the media.
You got a problem with that? Then e-mail this:
</P>
<P>
   As bad as the Philly flop turned out, Campo deserves, of course,
not to be judged on one game. And he won't be. Not here anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm also not so sure the football failure has been the worst
moment of Campo's week. How he handled himself from the minute that
game was over has certainly been watched closely. And judged
closely.
</P>
<P>
   To borrow a favorite Campo lead-in line when answering media
questions:
</P>
<P>
   To-be-honest-with-you ...
</P>
<P>
   Dave, you are coming across as weak.
</P>
<P>
   Those who desire to label Campo as ``Jerry's puppet'' have been
given ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the deal:
</P>
<P>
   Campo walked into a jam-packed media conference some 25 minutes
after Sunday's game, climbed to the podium, and started off with,
``Fellows, this is gonna be brief.''
</P>
<P>
   Perfect. Now, do some Jimmy theater. Give us one minute, with
the minicams rolling, of livid anger, then storm off the podium,
and out of the room. Take no questions. Take the blame (which Campo
did) and promise to correct the sins (which Campo did), but don't
give us (the media) the time of day after that.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Campo wasn't brief, and he wasn't mad enough. He spent
at least 20 minutes patiently giving good answers to hard
questions, which was certainly helpful. But it's every man for
himself in this bottomless pit. Campo needs to watch out for No. 1.
His players had already quit on him. The media won't be far behind.
</P>
<P>
   That was a too-docile beginning for Campo. The expected and
necessary explosion never happened.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was also another postgame scene that didn't seem to
fit the situation. On Monday, Campo spoke of being proud of how his
locker-room comments to the players the day before were limited. He
said he didn't have to say all that much because several veteran
players took the lead in scolding the troops.
</P>
<P>
   Huh? Just another opinion from the outside, but Campo should
have storm-trooped that locker room, shut up any player who wanted
to say anything, and then delivered a come-to-Jesus speech that
would have peeled paint off the walls. Name names, and dog-cuss
everybody, including immediate family members of every offensive
and defensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Dave, but that seems weak that you didn't personally
deliver the hell-fire sermon of your life to the same players who
had just left your coaching debut for dead out there on Jerry's
fake grass.
</P>
<P>
   Move it ahead then to Tuesday, the head coach's media-conference
day at Valley Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential credibility problem exists because of the
dazed state of quarterback Troy Aikman. Maybe you've noticed _
credibility has never been a strong point out there in Irving.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the skinny:
</P>
<P>
   Aikman suffered a medically diagnosed concussion on Sunday, the
eighth, 12th, 20th, 25th _ who knows the truth by now _ of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   I repeat. This is a concussion. The doctors said so. And
yesterday, the proper decision was finally made to sit Aikman for
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   But, somehow, the smokescreen of ``inner-ear infection'' had
been introduced this week to explain Aikman's condition. Jerry,
that's you, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   The implication here was someone at Valley Ranch wanted Aikman
back on the field in Tempe, regardless of a brain bruise. And, by
the way, Aikman did have an inner-ear infection last week, and
there was a medical question over his continuing headaches this
week being related to that, or the concussion.
</P>
<P>
   For credibility purposes, however, Campo should have stayed 10
miles away from ``inner-ear infection'' mumbo-jumbo. Instead, he
brings it up on his own Tuesday, traps himself into that no-escape
alley, and overall, it sounded Jerry-puppet-like.
</P>
<P>
   Campo is better than that and smarter than that. He has enough
football problems. He definitely needs no additional perception
negatives.

HIP NEW COACH HAS TEXAS TECH HUMMING HAPPY TUNE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The musical mess has abated at Texas Tech, giving way to a
spirit of compromise that seems to have struck a chord of
contentment in all parties.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Leach, the Red Raiders' first-year football coach with a
laundry list of push-the-envelope ideas to motivate his team, will
continue to inspire his team during practice with piped-in music of
his players' choosing. And the Tech band will continue working to
adapt instrumental versions of the tunes into their game-day
repertoire, as evidenced by the debut of two movie themes _
``Jaws'' and ``Mission: Impossible'' _ in last week's 38-16 rout of
Utah State.
</P>
<P>
   More selections may be in the offing for Saturday's 6 p.m. game
against North Texas, with ``Start Me Up'' by the Rolling Stones on
the short list of possibilities. Leach isn't sure, and much will
depend on how quickly the band can learn a tune like
``Headhunters'' to serenade the kickoff coverage squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're headed in the right direction. The instrumentals
the band converted are pretty neat,'' said Leach, who must have
established some type of Big 12 coach's record by discussing theme
music for 10 minutes during his weekly conference call with media
members.
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, Leach is Mr. Motivation. He has assistant
coaches dub inspirational clips from movies into videotapes the
players study. He concocted a ``Super Games'' competition during
spring drills, pitting players against one another in offbeat
sports like water polo to build camaraderie. But his master stroke
as a motivator might have come in preseason drills, when he
assigned each special-teams unit at Tech a theme song.
</P>
<P>
   Players practice to the music in daily drills. Leach sought a
game-day carryover, but his plan hit a snag in the Aug. 26 season
opener. Fans objected to hearing canned music from Metallica and
rapper Warren G, prompting the decision to have the Tech band
handle all music _ including theme song adaptations _ during games
at Jones SBC Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The rap song, in particular, drew the ire of Tech fans because
its lyrics contain the word ``damn.''
</P>
<P>
   Leach's response?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually a pretty clean rap song,'' Leach said. ``I read
the Bible a lot and it says `damn' in there, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it does. But not in the same context, a fact that is not
lost on the youngest man (39) in charge of a Big 12 football
program.
</P>
<P>
   As the new coach on the block, Leach is not willing to push the
envelope past the point of tolerability for West Texas residents.
So the canned music, rap or otherwise, is shelved on game days in
favor of heaping helpings of the Goin' Band from Raiderland. But
the boom box plays on at Tech workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll still do it in practice, regardless,'' Leach said. ``Our
players like it. It fires them up. Just because their tastes are
different \Rthan fans' musical preferences\S, that doesn't mean we
should cut someone off. If we can get to a happy medium on both
sides, it's a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're there. Some of those hard rock songs the band
plays gives them a new dimension, and it sounds great.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the varied musical tastes, there's one sound Tech fans
long to hear Saturday: the chime of victory bells from the East
Tower of the administration building after a game against North
Texas in Lubbock. The Red Raiders have not heard those since 1985,
a stretch that encompasses three Mean Green visits (1999, 1997,
1988) and three Tech coaching changes.
</P>
<P>
   If Leach can ring those bells, it will provide the sweetest
music sounded during his short tenure in Lubbock.
Quarterback mystery continues for 'Horns
Applewhite or Simms? Simms or Applewhite?
</P>
<P>
   No matter how you phrase it, that is the question that plagues
men's souls in Austin, where the sixth-ranked Longhorns will open
the season Saturday against Louisiana-Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be known, it hardly matters if Chris Simms or Major
Applewhite takes the opening snap against the Ragin' Cajuns (0-1),
a 451/2-point underdog coming off a 21-14 home loss to Sam Houston
State, a Division I-AA school.
</P>
<P>
   Both will play and both should thrive in a mismatch so glaring
it would make Kansas State coach Bill Snyder blush. With the
Longhorns committed to evaluating two quarterbacks and developing
young wide receivers, the biggest challenge for Texas coach Mack
Brown will be knowing when to pull back on the passing game before
critics begin drawing comparisons to former Houston coach John
Jenkins, master of the 10-touchdown victory margin.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has been guarded in his pregame comments. He won't
publicly identify a starter until game day. He refers to Applewhite
and Simms as ``co-starters.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brown might have tipped his hand, in terms of his grand plan
for the quarterback position, when he likened it to Texas' tailback
search last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it took us three or four weeks last year to figure
out our tailback situation,'' Brown said. ``It may take some time
to figure this thing out. It's hard to figure it out in two-a-days
because you don't hit quarterbacks. So you don't know how they're
going to respond in a ballgame. We've got to look at who's going to
be the best starter on Saturday. We've got to look at who comes off
the bench the best. We've got to look at the best chemistry for our
team.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Saturday's game is another dress rehearsal for
the quarterbacks before a more permanent decision is made. Logic
suggests that could come as soon as Sept. 16 against Stanford or as
late as Oct. 7 against Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, it's more important to note how well Simms and
Applewhite perform under fire rather than when they take their
snaps.
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:QUICK HITS
\Nsubheds:Opening in style Texas and Oklahoma State will be the
final Big 12 schools to open their seasons Saturday, with the
sixth-ranked Longhorns seeking to extend a league record. Texas has
had more success in season debuts than any Big 12 school, with a
career mark of 87-17-3. A victory over Louisiana-Lafayette would be
No. 88 for the Longhorns, eight more than any conference rival.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma reached the 80-victory plateau in openers last week in
a 55-14 rout of UT-El Paso. Behind the Sooners are Nebraska (76),
Iowa State (76) and Missouri (70). \Nsubheds:Bracing for Big Red
Through the years, few schools have played more high-profile games
in the regular season than Nebraska or Notre Dame. But the
Cornhuskers haven't played in South Bend, Ind., since 1947. That
will change Saturday, when No. 1 Nebraska (1-0) meets No. 23 Notre
Dame (1-0) in a contest that is creating numbers problems for the
participants. And we're not talking about national rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska officials estimate 30,000 fans will travel to the game,
even though the Big Red contingent is allotted only 4,000 of 80,232
seats in Notre Dame Stadium. To assist with the overflow, a
Nebraska alumni association has rented a nearby golf course to give
unsuccessful ticket buyers a place to congregate.
</P>
<P>
   From the Irish side of the equation, the pregame buzz is
significant enough that Notre Dame officials might move their
Friday pep rally from the basketball arena to the football stadium
to accommodate an estimated gathering between 30,000 and 40,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've probably never been associated with a game quite like
this so early in the season,'' Nebraska coach Frank Solich said.
``This one has been brought up almost constantly ... for as long as
I can remember. We're happy it's here, so we can finally play it.''
\Nsubheds:Picking up the pace Texas Tech coach Mike Leach said he
has been pleased with his offense's progress since opening the
season with a lethargic 24-3 victory over New Mexico on Aug. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Tech (2-0) rebounded last week to pound Utah State, 38-16, with
quarterback Kliff Kingsbury throwing for 450 yards and wide
receiver Carlos Francis grabbing seven passes for 234 yards and a
touchdown. Other players, said Leach, have shown signs of
approaching breakout status in practices. He cited wide receiver
Tim Baker, who grabbed 22 passes in a recent workout, as an
example.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to gauge things by asking, `Did we get a week's worth
better than our last game?,' '' Leach said. ``We did that, and then
some. I think we've got to be pretty satisfied with how many plays
we're making, at this point.''
\Nsubheds:INSIDE THE NUMBERS
\Nsubheds:Handling outside influences Big 12 schools have a 9-3
record in nonconference play. The .750 winning percentage is ahead
of the league's career pace against outsiders (.672) since the

POWERFUL RECEIVER GIVES TEXAS A&AMP;M BIG-PLAY OPTIONS

   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ A hard-nosed grandmother raised and
nurtured Robert Ferguson during his formative years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the strongest person in the world I know,'' Ferguson
said. ``She don't take no stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that explains why Texas A&AMP;M's big-play receiver appears
as tough as a $2.99 breakfast steak served at a highway truck stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gave me that mentality,'' Ferguson said. ``That's where I
get it from.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson's faint voice defies his 6-foot-2, 220-pound frame, but
don't mistake that sedate personality for weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two words come to my mind with Robert,'' said Aggies offensive
coordinator Steve Kragthorpe, who recruited the junior-college
All-American. ``No. 1, he's a great competitor. No. 2, he's a
warrior. He'll play hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson played in pain throughout the Aggies' 24-10 loss
Saturday to Notre Dame. The 20-year-old transfer from Tyler Junior
College suffered a painful shin bruise during the Aggies' first
offensive series and also required an IV at halftime, Kragthorpe
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't come out of a game,'' Kragthorpe said. ``To get him
out of a game, you'd have to put him on a cart, strap him down and
put him in a straitjacket.''
</P>
<P>
   That might be the best manner to defend Ferguson, who riddled
the Irish secondary for a game-high five receptions worth 79 yards
and drew two pass-interference penalties worth another 30 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson beat Notre Dame's Ron Israel on a deep post pattern in
the second quarter, but the Irish defender denied the big play by
grabbing the receiver's arms and settling for a 15-yard penalty.
Irish cornerback Cedric Jefferson utilized a move from the World
Wrestling Federation to mug Ferguson in the end zone to prevent a
third-quarter reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of those plays are touchdowns if they don't do it,''
quarterback Mark Farris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that's not something I have to get used to,'' Ferguson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders might be forced to rely on such tactics against
Ferguson, who combines size, speed, strength and athletic ability.
Ferguson once ran 40 yards in 4.36 seconds at Tyler Junior College,
and he bench-presses 400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he walks into a room, he looks like a linebacker,''
Kragthorpe said, ``but he plays wide receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   That presents matchup problems for many of college football's
smurf-sized defensive backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them are 5-9 and 5-10, and that presents a lot of
problems for defensive backs,'' Farris said. ``Whether you line him
up in the slot or outside, he's going to be so much bigger than
most of them. You don't find many receivers with his size and
speed. You might find some big guys like that, but they can't run
like he does.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies appear to have a special player, and Farris sensed it
as soon as he met him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell he was something different,'' Farris said.
``He's going to be a big weapon for us.''

TIME-SHARE BACKS BOOST SMU ATTACK

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ SMU is spreading its wings in the backfield, as Jason
Pipkins and Kris Briggs are sharing time at running back.
</P>
<P>
   Briggs led the team in rushing with 522 yards last season,
despite never starting a game. He was a projected starter before
this season, but a nagging hip injury and the emergence of Pipkins,
who didn't carry the ball in 1999, has given coach Mike Cavan a
dual attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was ever a case of a young man who worked himself
above his capabilities, it's Jason Pipkins,'' Cavan said. ``Briggs
has been out a lot, so I think you'll see both of those guys. With
Briggs, it's probably best for him because his hip is not going to
get any better.''
</P>
<P>
   Pipkins and Briggs had comparable outputs in the Mustangs' 31-17
opening-season victory Saturday against Kansas. Pipkins rushed 18
times for 74 yards, and Briggs had 20 carries for 71 yards and a
touchdown. Briggs said he was disappointed with the decision at
first, but has settled into his role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an I thing, it's a team thing,'' Briggs said. ``We
don't look at each other as competition. We both work hard because
it's going to take both of us to depend on each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The duo will see a different defense Saturday when the Mustangs
travel to UT-El Paso for their Western Athletic Conference opener.
The Miners use an eight-man defensive front that likes to blitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're anything like last year, maybe we can catch them on
a good day and the running game will be wide open,'' Briggs said.
``If we set up correctly, hopefully \Rwe'll\S catch them blitzing
the wrong side.'' \Nsubheds:Positive feelings Mike Cavan and the
Mustangs are still living off the positive vibes from their
season-opening victory in the new Gerald J. Ford Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was maybe the most important in a long time as
far as a victory, and I still felt that way a day or two after it
was over,'' Cavan said. ``But we don't want \Rthat excitement\S
just to be at the opening ceremonies of Ford Stadium. We want that
every week. That's the kind of atmosphere we want to have.''
\Nsubheds:O'Neill questionable Tight end Steve O'Neill sprained his
left ankle toward the end of the Jayhawks' game, and is
questionable for the UTEP game. O'Neill did not practice Monday or
Tuesday. \Nsubheds:Focusing on UTEP tight end The Mustangs' primary
concern could be UTEP tight end Brian Natkin. The nation's leading
returning tight end in receptions (59) and touchdowns (4) could be
a candidate for the John Mackey Award, given to the nation's top
tight end. Last season, Natkin caught five passes for 60 yards and
a touchdown in UTEP's 42-28 victory against SMU.
</P>
<P>
   Cavan is mainly looking for containment with Natkin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great players, they're going to do what they do and you
hope they don't go crazy,'' Cavan said. ``We have to be conscious
of him. We have to know what he likes to do, where he catches the
ball and, hopefully, have someone there.''

STARS GLAD TO BE BACK ON THE JOB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Rangers haven't seen the right side of .500
since mid-June. Playoff talk died not too long after.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, meanwhile, not only lost their season opener in
pathetic fashion Sunday but lost their star receiver and their
quarterback as well.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the sporting landscape here in North Texas hasn't been too
pretty lately. But we interrupt your regularly scheduled depressing
sports news to tell you that hope is on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for hockey again. Really, the Stars are back at Dr
Pepper StarCenter. They have a meeting tonight and physicals Friday
before flying to Vail, Colo., to begin training camp Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike last season, when the Stars wearily dragged their
Stanley Cup-winning behinds into camp, captain Derian Hatcher said
guys are eager to get back this time around.
</P>
<P>
   Losing a Cup does a lot for one's enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a different feeling, definitely different,'' Hatcher
said. ``I think there is a lot of guys with still a pretty sour
taste in their mouth, and when you have that, you can't wait to get
back and try to get it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were so close to winning their second Stanley Cup
championship they could almost taste it when they hit the ice June
10 for Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Finals against the New Jersey
Devils.
</P>
<P>
   A game, a couple of overtimes and a Jason Arnott goal later, it
was over.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had come up two victories short.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it does go away,'' Stars winger Mike Keane said.
``Every day something comes up. The newspaper has so-and-so taking
the Cup to so-and-so, and you can't help it. You start thinking
about the what-ifs. What if we don't lose three in a row at home? I
don't think there is a day that you don't think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the taste Hatcher was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   The players can't get rid of it. They can't ignore it. They,
instead, come to camp looking to replace it.
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock didn't have to talk to anyone. He
could see the change as players began to trickle in from their
summer vacations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got a lot of guys hungry and in shape and ready to compete
for work,'' Hitchcock said. ``I'm not talking about people who want
to make the team. I'm talking of guys who are going to be on the
team who want more ice time and a bigger bite of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Take winger Grant Marshall for instance. For a number of reasons
_ injury, lack of production _ he found himself on the outside
looking in for a good portion of last season. He left at the end of
last season out of shape and quickly falling out of favor.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall returned with 13 fewer pounds of fat clinging to his
body and talk of playing gritty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to bring that full style of game, of grind it out,
creating space, bring the energy and work as hard as I can, like I
did two years ago when I was healthy,'' Marshall said. ``I can
fight. I like fighting. I don't mind it, but I want to bring that
total package. Consistency is the biggest thing I have to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Stars are ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   And just in the nick of time.

SOFT RACETRACK WALLS' A HARD BARRIER TO RESOLVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rumors from Darlington Raceway last weekend about a possible
boycott by NASCAR Winston Cup drivers at the star-crossed New
Hampshire International Speedway have begun to dissipate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go to New Hampshire and race like we always have,''
reigning Cup champion Dale Jarrett said Tuesday in reference to the
New Hampshire 300 weekend Sept. 15-17. ``The thing I was hoping for
was either for them \Rowners Bob and Gary Bahre\S or someone in
NASCAR would get us a barrier. But it's not a necessity. It's not a
situation where anybody is looking at not going.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the renewed concern expressed by some of NASCAR's
highest-profile drivers about the Turn 3 concrete wall at NHIS _
site of the separate crashes that killed Adam Petty and Kenny Irwin
Jr. this season _ is unprecedented in the sport's recent feel-good
era. Jarrett, Jeff Gordon and Rusty Wallace all went on the record
at Darlington for installation of some sort of energy-dissipating,
``soft-wall'' technology at NHIS. Now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that most every driver in this garage area will be
totally blown away ... if we go back to New Hampshire and those
walls aren't lined,'' Wallace said Saturday, the day after current
points leader Bobby Labonte crashed in Turn 3 at Darlington when
the throttle on his car hung at approximately 180 mph. It is widely
believed, but unsubstantiated, that hung throttles caused the
crashes in practice that killed the 19-year-old Petty on May 11 and
the 30-year-old Irwin on July 7.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the pointed comments made by Jeff Burton before the
Brickyard 400 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway last month, Gordon
said he would be ``disappointed'' if no changes were made at NHIS
for this race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not put some extra protection out there when it's a
racetrack that all of us agree we want something to be on the walls
there, that can absorb some more impact?'' Gordon said. The
three-time Cup champion predicted ``a lot of backlash'' for Mike
Helton, NASCAR's senior vice president and chief operating officer,
and Gary Nelson, Winston Cup Series director, if no changes were
made.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the ``soft-wall'' issue has the potential to pit
the drivers against NASCAR's hierarchy in the eyes of the fans. And
because the drivers rate as genuine American heroes to the fans _
how many Mike Helton or Gary Nelson T-shirts do you have in your
collection? _ these well-intentioned men could be in for a rougher
ride than they deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Helton and Nelson steadfastly have maintained that nothing is
inherently wrong with the design of the 1.058-mile oval in Loudon,
N.H. Furthermore, both have pointed out that no material has been
developed to lessen the impact created when a 3,400-pound Cup car
crashes into a concrete wall at speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buzzword these days is `soft walls,' '' Nelson said during
a recent interview. ``We don't want the solution to create other
problems that may be worse. We found on road courses that a big
stack of tires or block of foam is great where the car leaves the
track. The problem we have on ovals is the racetrack goes right up
against the concrete. In that \Rinstance\S, there's a lot of
contact with a wall at a slight angle. That slight angle ... if the
wall gives at all, it will grab the car and literally suck it into
the wall and stop suddenly.''
</P>
<P>
   Helton said the sanctioning body remains open to any reasonable
solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of different test tracks and a lot of different
barriers in this country for a lot of different things, from
overlapping galvanized metal to cables inside tubing and
water-filled and sand-filled,'' Helton said. ``I mean, it's
incredible the different types of barriers being used. The dilemma
is finding one that's better than concrete in motorsports.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the Brickyard 400, Cup cars have been equipped
with a mandatory throttle stop and ignition kill switch on the
steering wheel, a switch Labonte said he did not have time to click
before his crash Friday. NASCAR also is studying a device being
developed by Roush Racing engineers that would shut off the
ignition and engine if a driver applies the brakes when the
throttle sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett indicated Tuesday the majority of drivers understand the
effort being expended by NASCAR on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just snap your fingers and have hung throttles go
away, and you just can't snap your fingers and have a barrier,''
Jarrett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an ongoing work in progress that we're very serious
about,'' Helton said, ``in spite of what some people believe.''
SPOTLIGHT ON...
Tracy's CART title chase gets an honest boost
Paul Tracy discovered Sunday that teammate Dario Franchitti truly
is a man of his word. Because he is, Tracy held on to win the
Vancouver Molson Indy and reestablished himself as a title
contender in the CART FedEx Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Team owner Barry Green and the two Team Kool Green drivers
agreed that whichever held the lead after the last pit stop on the
1.781-mile temporary street course would stay in front. Franchitti
was in the lead when the teammates pitted on Lap 53 of the
90-lapper under caution.
</P>
<P>
   But the Scotsman stalled his Honda-Reynard while attempting to
exit his pit box, allowing Tracy to drive around and into the lead.
Franchitti did pressure Tracy when the race went green on Lap 60,
but kept up his end of the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``A team's got to work together, and that's what our biggest
strength is,'' said Tracy, who scored the 18th victory of his
Championship Auto Racing Teams career. ``Dario and I work together
and work hard and concentrate on being fair with each other. Yeah,
we've had our accidents, but that hasn't caused any
self-destruction in the team. We're honest with each other.
Sometimes it's not that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy scored his third victory of the season, and second in as
many races, by 0.384 seconds. Tracy began the day sixth in points,
25 behind Michael Andretti. But Tracy's victory and Andretti's
last-lap drop to 12th because of a mechanical problem moved the
Canadian to within six points (126-120) heading into the Honda
Grand Prix at Laguna Seca Raceway in Monterey, Calif., this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   CART's top five drivers are separated by 11 points. Adrian
Fernandez of Patrick Racing is third with 117 points, followed by
Gil de Ferran of Marlboro Team Penske with 116 and Roberto Moreno,
also of Patrick, fifth with 115.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy, who has won races at four of the five tracks remaining on
the schedule, believes that Andretti still presents his toughest
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been there, done it, won championships and knows he can
win anywhere on a given day,'' Tracy said of Andretti, the 1991
series champion. ``He's got the most experience of anybody, so he's
going to be the toughest guy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tracy also is convinced this is his best shot at earning his
first CART championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is a good situation,'' said Tracy, who won at
Laguna Seca in 1993 and 1994, the latter when he led all 84 laps en
route to victory. ``I led the championship for seven or eight races
\Rthis season\S and would have liked to have checked out. Now we're
not focusing on the championship so much. I think maybe that was a
big part of our problem in the middle of the season. All we were
worried about was points, points, points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're going to go out and race as hard as we can and
wherever we end up at the end of the year is what's going to
happen. It's worked the last two races. Hopefully, it will work the
last five.''
PIT STOPS Meyer lines up buyers Texas Motorplex owner Billy Meyer
continues to shop his drag-racing facility in Ennis.
</P>
<P>
   Elon Werner, Motorplex general manager, said he expects Meyer to
use the O'Reilly Fall Nationals on Oct. 19-22 as a ``showcase'' for
three prospective owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be surprised if Billy's the owner in 2001,'' Werner said.
``He's talking to three people that are really serious about it.
They're fans of the sport and have the financial means to buy the
track. Billy wants to sell it to someone who will be a real good
caretaker. He's put 30 years into NHRA drag racing and wants to
make sure those years won't be wasted.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer decided to sell the track he opened in 1986 after National
Hot Rod Association officials pulled the Motorplex's spring
national event from the 2001 schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket information for the race is available by calling (972)
878-2641 or at www.texasmotorplex.com. Waiting on Mikey CART
superstar Michael Andretti, the series' winningest active driver
and current points leader, is expected to make an announcement
about his future after the Honda Grand Prix at Laguna Seca Raceway
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation is that Andretti, who has driven for Newman/Haas
Racing a total of 10 years in two stints, will leave the team to
become part of a new group affiliated with Barry Green's two-car
Team Kool Green. Andretti and his father, Mario, are expected to
have ownership in the team, allowing Michael to compete in the
Championship Auto Racing Teams FedEx Championship Series and the
rival Indy Racing League's Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Andretti won his only Indy 500 in 1969. Michael, 37, last
competed at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 1995, the year
before the series split. Monza chicane under fire Changes in the
legendary Monza circuit for the Italian Grand Prix have prompted a
forecast of doom for the start of the Formula One race Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The new-look Rettifilio chicane in Turn 1 is much tighter than
in previous years and bordered by asphalt as opposed to gravel.
Because of the narrowness of the chicane, a number of drivers fear
there will be an accident heading into Turn 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to see the braking points to the corner, and so
many people are cutting the chicane because of that,'' David
Coulthard of McLaren-Mercedes said after testing the layout.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a 100 percent chance of an accident at the start,''
Jordan driver Jarno Trulli said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be carnage at the start,'' Arrows racer Pedro
de la Rosa said. ``I just hope I'm not part of it.'' Last laps
Buddy Lazier, the Indy Racing Northern Light Series points leader,
is scheduled to join two other teams in a test at Texas Motor
Speedway on Monday. The season-ending Excite 500 is scheduled at
the 1.5-mile quadoval Oct. 15.
</P>

   The late Greg Moore's No. 99 officially was retired by the CART
FedEx and Dayton Indy Lights series at the Vancouver Molson Indy on
Sunday. Moore, a 24-year-old resident of the Vancouver, British

   Rusty Wallace is the runaway leader in Winston Cup poles this
season with eight, five more than runner-up Dale Jarrett. The most
Bud Pole Awards won by a driver in a single season during NASCAR's

<P>
   Native Texan Bobby Labonte's 111-point lead over runner-up Dale
Jarrett ties the largest margin of the season and is equal to the
difference between a first and 31st-place finish.

BACK FROM THE BEACH AND BOUND FOR TORONTO 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK LYMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ The beach chairs are back in the garage, the
children have returned to the custody of their teachers, summer's
hot breath has taken on the faint scent of autumn and, once again,
the publicists are returning to Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   It can mean only one thing: The summer movie season is finally,
blessedly over, and it's time for the Toronto International Film
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   This year marks the 25th annual gathering of filmmakers, actors,
agents, producers, publicists and the ladies and gentlemen of the
entertainment press, an event that not only has grown into one of
the world's most important film markets but also has become the
prime launching pad for the fall and holiday season's Oscar bait.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year ``American Beauty'' and ``The Cider House
Rules'' were fighting it out for the top Oscars, Kevin Spacey from
``Beauty'' was vying with Denzel Washington from ``The Hurricane''
for best actor, and Hilary Swank of ``Boys Don't Cry'' was carting
off practically every acting award in Hollywood, including the
Oscar. Every one of those films got its first big exposure at last
year's Toronto festival.
</P>
<P>
   While this year's gathering will include some special events
geared to the 25th anniversary _ including the festival's first
filmmaker tribute since 1984, honoring the director Stephen Frears
_ the festival will largely look as it has in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a funny way, we didn't want the anniversary to impact on
the festival,'' said Piers Handling, director of the festival for
the last seven years. ``We wanted some special events, but we
didn't want them to take over because, obviously, the festival is
on a roll.''
</P>
<P>
   There were 1,832 films submitted to this year's festival,
compared with 1,585 last year. ``And that doesn't include the films
we're seeing on screening trips,'' Handling said. ``In the end, 329
made the cut, including 178 world or North American premieres, from
56 countries, 253 of them feature-length films. Last year, we had
254, so it's basically the same size festival as last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's opening gala, which is traditionally reserved
for a film from a Canadian director, will be Denys Arcand's
``Stardom,'' about a small-town girl's sudden rise in the modeling
world, with an ensemble cast including Dan Aykroyd and Frank
Langella. The closing night film, on Sept. 16, will be Michael
Kalesniko's ``How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog,'' a comedy with
Kenneth Branagh and Robin Wright Penn as a struggling playwright
and his baby-obsessed wife.
</P>
<P>
   There will be plenty in between. The writer and director Cameron
Crowe will unveil ``Almost Famous,'' his first film since ``Jerry
Maguire'' in 1996, based on his own adventures as a teen-age
Rolling Stone reporter. Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding Jr. will
star in ``Men of Honor,'' a big-studio adventure about the first
black Navy Seal. Richard Gere will headline ``Dr. T and the
Women,'' from the director Robert Altman.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Glazer, a first-time director, will offer ``Sexy
Beast,'' starring Ben Kingsley as a veteran crook. The director
Terence Davies has an adaptation of Edith Wharton's ``House of
Mirth,'' and the director Ang Lee, returning to China, offers
``Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,'' a martial-arts fantasy that was
a hit at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year. Tom Tykwer,
the director of the 1998 festival's biggest surprise, ``Run Lola
Run,'' returns with ``The Princess and the Warrior,'' about a
psychiatric nurse (Franka Potente, star of ``Lola'') whose life is
saved by a small-time crook.
</P>
<P>
   As for performances, the publicists are already fanning the
Oscar buzz as vigorously as they can. Among those drawing the most
prefestival attention were Joan Allen, playing a United States
senator with a sex secret in her past in Rod Lurie's ``The
Contender,'' and Willem Dafoe in ``Shadow of the Vampire,'' playing
a fictional version of Max Shreck, the actor who starred in F.W.
Murnau's classic vampire film, ``Nosferatu.'' And, no doubt, a crop
of sleepers will emerge from the public screenings held at packed
cinemas all over downtown Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my 19th Toronto festival in a row,'' said Amir Malin,
chairman of Artisan Entertainment. ``I love Toronto as a town. I
love the Toronto audiences, who have a great affinity for films,
both ones that are artistically oriented and ones that are more
commercially oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto festival has always served at least two functions _
a place where distributors can unveil releases before an
appreciative audience (as well as the largest annual concentration
of North American entertainment journalists) and a market where
producers and directors can try to interest distributors in buying
the rights to their films.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toronto has always been the best launching pad for a movie of
any festival in the world,'' said Tom Bernard, co-president of Sony
Pictures Classics, which has seven films in Toronto this year.
``It's like a big press junket that the newspapers have paid for
themselves. So we can bring in our talent, screen our movies with
very favorable audiences and make the talent available for
newspapers all over North America. The Sundance festival is more of
an industry audience. The New York festival is much more, well,
they're patrons of the arts, not your mainstream filmgoer. But the
Toronto audience is real moviegoers. They get every nuance, and
they love movies.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If the festival has changed in recent years, as many believe,
perhaps it has become more important as a launching site and
somewhat less important as a film market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has less to do with the festival than with the ebbs and
flows of the movie business,'' Malin said. ``I can remember going
into Toronto and having five or six different films that everyone
would be bidding on. Now there is less and less product that is
available in a festival context, because there is a tendency when
there is a good project around for one of us to pre-buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees. Tom Ortenberg and Mark Urman, co-presidents
of Lions Gate Films, said they had continued to have success
picking up films in Toronto in recent years (``The Big Kahuna''
last year, ``The Red Violin'' the year before) and hoped to buy
more this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always go there with an eye toward obtaining important
titles for our lineup,'' Urman said. ``I think there are certainly
a number of prospective acquisitions there this year, including
many that will be seen for the very first time by anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   If there has been a shift in the festival, Ortenberg said, it
has been to keep getting bigger _ not just in the number of films,
but in their scope and in the swirl of events that surround the
screenings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's always represented such an interesting blend of
the biggest of Hollywood and the most obscure of international
films and everything in between,'' he said. ``Most of the other
festivals have an imported audience, but here you have a major
metropolis that just gives itself over to the festival in a way
that is really unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   Urman described it this way: ``With the New York Film Festival,
if you veer two blocks away from Lincoln Center, you don't even
know it's going on. But when you get off the plane in Toronto,
you're bombarded. You can't escape it; it's omnipresent.''

PROSECUTOR BECOMES A CELEBRITY IN BRAZIL BY ROOTING OUT
CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Subs 13th graf, `Let the ...,' to soften quote from waiter,
changing `bastards' to scoundrels.) 
By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil _ To his enemies, whose numbers seem to be
growing by the day, Luiz Francisco de Souza is ``the Torquemada of
Brasilia,'' a reincarnation of the fanatic priest who commanded the
Spanish Inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   But de Souza is a federal prosecutor, not a cleric, and he
bristles at the suggestion that he is engaged in anything other
than a crusade to bring honesty, openness and accountability to
government here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more the truth is hidden, the easier it becomes for
iniquity to reign,'' he said in an interview. ``There is a lot of
corruption in Brazil, and many things to be ashamed of, but we also
have a Constitution that clearly spells out the functions and
powers of a prosecutor, and those are to defend the democratic
order and morality in administration.''
</P>
<P>
   De Souza owes his controversial image and sudden prominence
primarily to an investigation he is leading into the whereabouts of
nearly $150 million that vanished during the still unfinished
construction of a federal courthouse in Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of his efforts, a senator was recently expelled from
office for corruption and the chief labor court judge in Sao Paulo
is now a fugitive, with his bank accounts frozen and posters
seeking his arrest on display at every airport.
</P>
<P>
   But even before that case put him in the national spotlight, de
Souza, 38, led a separate inquiry that forced the lower house of
the Brazilian Congress to banish one of its members, a former state
police chief, now jailed for his part in the murders of dozens of
opponents and criminals, some of whom were butchered with chain
saws and thrown into acid baths.
</P>
<P>
   And after prosecutors found that cabinet ministers and other top
officials were flying to beach resorts on air force planes at
taxpayer expense, a law was passed banning that practice.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most astonishing of all to Brazilians, who are
accustomed to seeing favoritism and nepotism at high levels go
unpunished, is that de Souza and his team have not hesitated to
make their own colleagues targets when malfeasance is suspected.
After a prosecutor in Sao Paulo, for example, was recently found to
have received a $51,000 check from a figure involved in the
courthouse case, they ordered an investigation opened against him,
too.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, the targets of de Souza's prosecutorial
zeal are none too happy these days.
</P>
<P>
   One exasperated bureaucrat last month labeled the federal
prosecutor's office here ``a judicial loony bin.'' And with
municipal elections scheduled for October, members of Congress have
accused de Souza of trying to advance his own career and the
interests of opposition parties at their expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you are doing wounds the sensibilities of many people,''
Sen. Pedro Simon, a prominent member of the government coalition,
complained at a recent congressional hearing. ``A prosecutor sends
some mayor from a town in the interior off to jail and he becomes a
star on television.''
</P>
<P>
   But de Souza's efforts seem to delight and amaze the average
Brazilian. On the streets, he is recognized with increasing
frequency, and is often greeted with pats on the back, thumbs-up
signs, honks from car horns or shouts of encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the scoundrels squirm,'' Evandro Vieira Milhomen, a waiter
here, said approvingly of those who have been caught up in de
Souza's investigative web. ``It's about time that somebody called
the rich and powerful to account and made them understand that the
law applies to them too, and not just to us poor folks.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of de Souza's appeal is the novelty of the crusading
prosecutor, a figure who, while quite familiar in the United
States, is not common here. In fact, until the ratification of the
constitution drawn up after the fall of a military dictatorship
here in 1985, one of the main duties of the ``Public Ministry,'' as
the prosecutor's office is known, was to defend the federal
government against lawsuits and provide legal counsel to the
executive branch.
</P>
<P>
   But the current constitution, dating from 1988, not only set up
a separate Advocate General's post to fill those functions, it gave
prosecutors a whole gamut of new powers to ferret out wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Today, their responsibilities include the ``defense of the
judicial order, the democratic regime and of social and individual
interests,'' ranging from the environment and monitoring the
behavior of police forces to assuring Indian and consumer rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what they are doing is wonderful,'' said David
Fleischer, president of the Brazilian chapter of Transparency
International, the anti-corruption group. ``They are filling a
void, playing a role like that of the Government Accounting Office
or the Inspector General'' in the United States and ``doing what
the executive and legislative branches really ought to be doing
themselves but are not.''
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, de Souza would seem an unlikely candidate for
the role of the defiant defender of the public interest. He is
mild-mannered in the extreme, even timid, is gawky and slightly
hunchbacked, tends to mumble in a child-like voice when confronted
by a battery of cameras or reporters, and has ascetic personal
habits that the newsmagazine Veja describes as ``eccentric.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a society used to seeing the rules bent, it is precisely
de Souza's rectitude that seems to have made him a celebrity. A
former Jesuit seminarian who reluctantly gave up his religious
vocation because of health reasons, he still lives with his parents
in a modest house here, drives a battered old Volkswagen Beetle,
donates part of his $4,500-a-month salary to charity and has only
one known extravagance: a personal library of some 7,000 books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like those possessed by divine fire, Luiz Francisco is austere
and simple,'' Veja reported in a profile last month. ``He has two
sports jackets, one single pair of shoes, and his few shirts are
all identical and white.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingenuous or not, de Souza and his colleagues have so irritated
the government that a proposed ``gag law'' to prohibit prosecutors,
judges and police from making any public comment whatsoever on
pending cases, with violators subject to fines of up to $125,000
and three years in prison, has now been revived and sent to
Congress. De Souza's response, however, is that what Brazil needs
is more publicity about official misbehavior, not less.
</P>
<P>
   ``That court building was only able to get so much money from
the government because for years the work of the auditors who were
investigating it was held under lock and key,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Prosecutors has also condemned the
initiative, arguing it would only hobble the work of public
officials who ``work tirelessly to fulfill their constitutional
duty to defend the public patrimony.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The function of all the great biblical prophets was to go to
those who rule and say `you cannot do this,' to denounce illicit
actions even at the cost of their own lives,'' de Souza added. ``It
is amazing that we are now in a new millennium and we still have
people who are trying to silence those who dare to open their
mouths against infamy.''

PETER SERKIN MIXES THE NEW WITH THE NEARLY NEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, September 10)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Serkin has never been an ordinary virtuoso. His deep
concern with the music of living composers has brought him to work
more than most solo pianists in collaborative contexts (his modest
demeanor has surely helped here) and encouraged him to be
unconventional in his programming. He is more likely to be found
playing the piano part in Schoenberg's ``Pierrot Lunaire'' than
that in a Rachmaninoff concerto, and any recital of his will
probably include at least one contemporary piece.
</P>
<P>
   So he has all the qualities Judith Arron, the executive and
artistic director of Carnegie Hall until her death in 1998, was
looking for when she set about inviting a few musicians to imagine
coherent sequences of concerts that they and others would give at
the hall around the time of the new millennium. Last season
Maurizio Pollini, Pierre Boulez and Daniel Barenboim presented
their extensive Perspectives series; now (along with second seasons
of Perspectives from Pollini and Barenboim) comes Serkin's turn, in
a more compact group of concerts to take place in March 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking recently at his summer home near Tanglewood in the
Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts, Serkin, 53 and a son of the
revered pianist Rudolf Serkin, recalled how Arron had worded her
invitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``She spoke about making music,'' he said. ``When I hear that
phrase I immediately think of composers first, and so I decided I
would have some very new music, with older music around that. At
first the series was going to be much larger. As it's turned out,
there are just four concerts, and in all of them the repertory
begins in the 20th century. That was something that just happened,
but I'm very pleased about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The concerts, utterly characteristic of Serkin's musical
interests, include late works by Stravinsky, a little Schoenberg
and Webern, and pieces by Stefan Wolpe and Toru Takemitsu to bring
the story forward to music by five living composers: Charles
Wuorinen, Peter Lieberson, Oliver Knussen, Alexander Goehr and
George Benjamin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles Wuorinen once said to me that a program ought to
include a work by an old master, a work by a 20th-century master, a
work by an older living composer and a work by a young composer,''
Serkin said. ``I've just left out the first category, though I
would also have liked to include pieces by younger composers than I
have.''
</P>
<P>
   The music by younger composers was one casualty of the
curtailment of the series for financial reasons. Another was
Olivier Messiaen, the most conspicuous absentee among recent
composers with whom Serkin has been most closely associated. He
wanted at one stage to include a big Messiaen piece: probably
``From the Canyons to the Stars,'' which he played this summer at
the Lincoln Center Festival. But finally, there was no room.
</P>
<P>
   Any limitation, though, is more than balanced by the opportunity
to hear the selected composers in depth. Wuorinen is represented in
three of the four programs, by an orchestral piece, a chamber
composition (his Horn Trio) and a set of songs (to words by James
Fenton, the librettist of his forthcoming work for the New York
City Opera). Knussen, Goehr and Lieberson all appear in two
programs each.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to let the audience get familiarized with these
composers,'' Serkin said. ``I hoped people would come and hear one
new piece, and be intrigued, and want to hear more. Then the older
music fits around the newer, in a way. Stravinsky connects with
Charles Wuorinen. Schoenberg and Webern were very important to
Alexander Goehr.''
</P>
<P>
   All four concerts will feature the London Sinfonietta, conducted
by Knussen, a longtime friend and colleague of Serkin's. The first
two programs will occupy the main auditorium at Carnegie Hall and
will each include an orchestral piece by Takemitsu and a pair of
late Stravinsky works.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember going to the first New York performances of some of
the late Stravinsky pieces, with him conducting,'' Serkin said, ``
`Threni' in particular. The climaxes and the energy in the rhythm
were unforgettable. But still the music hasn't caught on with the
public somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   These performances should help. Knussen is a marvelous
Stravinsky performer, and in ``Movements'' he will be joined by
Serkin at the piano, as in a forthcoming Deutsche Grammophon
recording. Also to be heard are the Variations, the compact
biblical fable ``The Flood'' and ``Requiem Canticles.''
</P>
<P>
   All four of these works date from Stravinsky's last creative
decade, before he became too ill to compose, at the end of the
1960s. All are brilliant examples of the composer's capacity to
learn from much younger composers _ Boulez, Krzysztof Penderecki _
and still remain, in every fizzing measure, himself. ``Movements''
is a compressed piano concerto bursting with life and invention.
``Requiem Canticles,'' Stravinsky's last major work, is an open
stare into the eyes of death.
</P>
<P>
   The danger might be that these supreme pieces, which seem to
become ever more crucial as time goes on, would shrivel any other
music of the last 50 years placed near them. But Serkin appears to
have guarded against that in his judicious choices. The two
Stravinsky-centered programs will include, besides their delicate
Takemitsu works, highly colorful pieces by Knussen (``The Way to
Castle Yonder''), Wuorinen (his recent ``Symphony Seven'') and
Lieberson (``Red Garuda''). Here, too, will come the taste of
Schoenberg: his graphic ``Accompaniment to a Film Scene.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Red Garuda,'' in which a giant bird of Hindu and Buddhist
legend is portrayed with flexing metal feathers and a sonorous
beating of wings, is the second of Lieberson's two piano concertos
and something like the eighth work he has written for Serkin, who
played it last season at its Boston Symphony premiere and then at
the Tanglewood Festival this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it very much,'' he said. ``Of course, it's entirely
different from the first concerto, which was so wonderfully
unreasonable. This one is free of frivolous extra decoration, very
straightforward, with well-chosen notes.'' Yet the piece is also
brilliant and clear, and in those ways not so distant from another
picture of a mythic avian, Stravinsky's ``Firebird.''
</P>
<P>
   The other two concerts will take place in Weill Recital Hall,
and here newly commissioned pieces _ by Goehr and, again, Lieberson
_ will be presented. Both are piano quintets, which Serkin will
play with the Orion String Quartet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The piano quintet is, I think, a wonderful medium but not much
used these days,'' he said. ``Alexander Goehr's piece is already
written. It's a big work, in three movements, lasting half an hour,
and it's extremely clear, lean. It has a lightness that's very rare
in the piano quintet. I asked him if I could have it a year ahead,
because I wanted to get to know it thoroughly. For me that means,
first of all, getting to know the whole piece, approaching it as if
I were a composer or a conductor studying it. After that I start to
learn my part. Right now I'm looking forward to working on it with
the quartet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, there are also times when you have to work more
quickly. I remember one time when I was in Tokyo with Oliver
Knussen, and he was writing `Prayer Bell Sketch' for me, faxing it
a few measures at a time from his hotel to mine. The ending I got
only on the morning of the performance. So that was kind of fun, an
adventure. But whether I have a long time to prepare or a little
doesn't really matter. The quality of the work is much more
important, and I'm just glad these composers can write these pieces
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE)  &QL; 
 &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   Serkin's enthusiasm for his chosen composers is so evident in
how he speaks _ just as it is in how he performs _ that the obvious
question is whether he has ever composed music himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I've tried to put notes and rhythms on paper,'' he said.
``When I was young, I composed quite a bit. My father was very
critical. He told me how Schoenberg had said you couldn't compose
until you knew all the Haydn quartets. So I got to know all the
Haydn quartets. But my love is for music. I love to listen to
music, and did from an early age. And at that time I was already
studying the piano seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   So when did he decide he was going to be a concert pianist?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's happened yet,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the listening goes on. ``Nowadays I often listen to
the radio,'' Serkin said. ``I like the unexpected. I enjoy
listening to recordings of new music, and I've been listening to
some older recordings of Otto Klemperer: recordings from the Kroll
Opera in 1927, when he has the music on fire. I always loved
Klemperer particularly. I heard him rehearse and perform. Just
observing him provided great lessons in music.''
</P>
<P>
   Other musicians he remembers with special intensity include the
violinist Alexander Schneider, the flutist Marcel Moyse, the
pianist Mieczyslaw Horszowski and the cellist and conductor Pablo
Casals, all of whom he heard in his father's company at the
Marlboro Music Festival in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Relationships with composers he has made for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Toru Takemitsu I had a close friendship,'' he said.
``When I played a piece for him, he didn't make a lot of comments.
He seemed curious about what the possibilities might be from a
performer's point of view. He was very open-minded. Sometimes he
would just sit at the piano and play pop songs, including some with
his own texts, but always with that gracefulness of his. I'd got
interested in the music of his that was a lot more wild _ pieces
like `Arc,' for piano and orchestra _ but then I started to
appreciate the sweetness of his later music, the things that were
so fastidiously and beautifully realized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stefan Wolpe I met at a party after one of Stravinsky's
concerts. What he said was very poetic, but he was already ill. I
never played for him, though I did play for Irma Wolpe, his second
wife, who had some of his manuscripts, often with a lot more
indications than there are in the published scores.''
</P>
<P>
   A fair amount of Wolpe has come out on record lately, but in the
concert hall his music is as rare as late Stravinsky. The reasons
are similar: the unfamiliarity of the music to performers, and
therefore the amount of rehearsal time required. But the vividness
locked up in this music is similar, too.
</P>
<P>
   Serkin recalled coaching a group at Tanglewood in Wolpe's
``Piece in Two Parts.'' ``We rehearsed for 75 hours,'' he said,
``and then the piece became electric.''
</P>
<P>
   In his recitals and solo recordings, Serkin has been a great
exponent of both Wolpe and Takemitsu, but in these concerts he will
be in his favorite role of listener, hearing Knussen conduct
Takemitsu's ``Green'' and ``How Slow the Wind,'' and hearing the
Orion String Quartet and the London Sinfonietta play some of
Wolpe's caustic, fantastical chamber pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it so important that I play all the time,'' he
said. ``And I didn't have any specific plan in assembling the
programs. I'm not really conceptual. I just tried to think of works
that will sound well together.''(BOX)

INVESTORS BAIL OUT OF TECHNOLOGY AND SEMICONDUCTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investors bailed out of semiconductor stocks again
Wednesday, driving the Nasdaq composite index, which rallied 11.7
percent last month, to its second consecutive decline and its
biggest since late July.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the main instigator of the technology fall appeared
to be Micron Technology, which slumped $9.50, to $68.75, on the New
York Stock Exchange, after its rating was cut by Donaldson, Lufkin
&AMP; Jenrette. Intel played a similar role on Tuesday and fell an
additional $3.55 Wednesday, to $65.50, on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stocks are being downgraded, making people nervous, worried
about'' price-to-earnings ratios, said Mayer Offman, the chief
trading officer at Carlin Equities. ``They're in sell mode,'' he
added, predicting this would persist for a few more days before the
market rebounded.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq lost 129.84 points, or 3.13 percent, to 4,013.34,
finishing at the session's low for the second consecutive day,
suggesting to some that more selling remained to be done. The index
also slipped back into negative territory for the year, down 1.38
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other markets fared better, largely because strength in a
handful of financial stocks and in oil shares partly offset
weakness in technology and in drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 14.83 points, or
about 1 percent, to 1,492.25. Advancing issues, however, outpaced
declining ones by a sizable margin, 286 to 194.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, meanwhile, rode another big
gain in J.P. Morgan to an advance of 50.03 points, or 0.44 percent,
to 11,310.64. Morgan jumped $7.81, to $167.75, accounting for
nearly all of the Dow's rise, on speculation that it is to be
acquired by Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But semiconductors and their ilk grabbed much of the attention
as the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 5.71 percent,
cutting its gain so far this year to just above 50 percent. Among
the other big losers were Applied Micro Circuits, down $10.77, to
$179.05; PMC-Sierra down $16.58, to $217.05; and Xilinx down $7.13,
to $81.94.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what to make of Nasdaq,'' said Donna Van Vlack,
head trader at Brandywine Asset Management. ``Is this backing and
filling or the beginning or real decay?''
</P>
<P>
   This week's decline of 220.99 points was the severest since a
July 26-28 swoon of 366.57 points that preceded the August rally.
Wednesday's volume swelled to 1.76 billion shares from 1.60 billion
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Associates First Capital was the other major financial standout
Wednesday, leaping $10.50, to $38.50, on word that Citigroup was
buying it for $31.1 billion in stock. Citigroup fell $3.02, to
$54.92.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, H.J. Heinz fell $1.75, to $35.44, after the company
warned that profits in the current quarter would fall short of
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   With prescription coverage increasingly a focus of election
debate, drug stocks sank further, with Merck, downgraded by Banc of
America Securities on Tuesday, down $2.19, to $65.888, and Eli
Lilly, Bristol-Myers and American Home Products all down $2 or
more.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange there were 1,620 stocks that rose
compared with 1,255 that fell, with 167 stocks making new 52-week
highs and 32 making new lows. Volume climbed about 20 percent from
Tuesday's pace to a more normal 998 million shares.

LA SCALA BIDS ADDIO TO A FAVORITE HAUNT OF CATCALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETTA POVOLEDO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ These days the real drama at La Scala in Milan is taking
place in the auditorium and not onstage. When the season starts up
again with Puccini's ``Boheme'' on Tuesday, the 200 standing-room
places of the first and second galleries will no longer be
occupied. This is tragic news for its habitual dwellers, the feared
and respected ``loggionisti,'' the ardent opera buffs who sit or
stand in the galleries and are said to dictate the failure or
success of a performer, a conductor or even an opera at the
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Last week administrators at La Scala announced that having
people stand in the two galleries did not conform to fire
regulations, and so standing-room tickets, which cost about $5,
would no longer be sold. They had been so prized that people stood
in line for hours for them. Administrators did promise that the
galleries would be restructured to conform to fire regulations as
part of the theater's general overhaul, which is expected to begin
at the end of next year. Until then, opera lovers will have to pay
$12 to $150 (what tickets usually sell for) and just sit tight.
</P>
<P>
   La Scala was built in 1776 by Empress Maria Theresa of Austria
to replace an earlier building that had burned down. Nearly all of
the world's greatest opera singers have performed there over the
years, and many great operas have had their world premieres there,
including Verdi's ``Nabucco,'' ``Falstaff'' and ``Otello'' and
Bellini's ``Norma.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a flop on Broadway, failure at La Scala does not
necessarily mean the disappearance of a work. The world premiere of
Puccini's ``Madama Butterfly'' at La Scala in 1904, for example,
was a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the lapses in judgment, many agree that the power to
make or break the reputation of performers, conductors and operas
comes from the loggionisti, who greeted the decision to cut the
standing-room places with dismay.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very unpleasant because we will lose a traditionally
passionate public that truly loves opera, lives for opera and will
line up for tickets for hours, making huge sacrifices just to see a
performance,'' said Giuseppe Castagnetti, president of Gli Amici
del Loggione, a group of 2,000 opera aficionados who occupy most of
the seats in the balconies. ``A theater is more than just its
conductors and the works that are presented in it, but also its
public.''
</P>
<P>
   At La Scala the public usually means the loggionisti. He said
that the opera house's decision was even more serious coming just
before the start of its millennium season, which will feature 11
works by Verdi, starting with ``Il Trovatore'' on Dec. 7 and for
which tickets will be even more in demand than usual.
</P>
<P>
   The loggionisti, whose legendary fanaticism has more than once
been compared to that of Italy's soccer fans, recoil at being
considered a claque of people who for money or free tickets or
simply out of passion band together to applaud or deride a
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, they pride themselves on their familiarity with libretti
and scores, and part of the mandate of Gli Amici del Loggione is to
hold regular conferences and two or three-day workshops before
every new La Scala offering. Such intimate knowledge of the music
tends to breed contempt of less-than-perfect performances. Some say
that Luciano Pavarotti has refused to sing again at La Scala since
he was booed in 1992 by the loggionisti during his first
performance of Verdi's ``Don Carlo.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago the American soprano Renee Fleming was booed
repeatedly when she sang the lead in a summer production of
Donizetti's ``Lucrezia Borgia.'' Even emerging singers are not
spared. ``For a young singer, performing in front of the
loggionisti is like coming into hell,'' said a La Scala employee
who asked not be named. ``Knowing there are people who can destroy
you listening in the gallery _ well, for the singers it feels a lot
like going to the front in the middle of a battle.''
</P>
<P>
   The loggionisti defend their right to speak out (or make
catcalls).
</P>
<P>
   One 30-year veteran of La Scala who was more than once the
target of the loggione's disapproval said she was nonetheless sorry
to see the standing-room places go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the loggionisti because I have received the warmest
demonstrations of approval from them,'' said the mezzo-soprano
Fiorenza Cossotto, who made her singing debut at La Scala in
Poulenc's ``Dialogues des Carmelites'' in 1957. ``At the same time
no one wants to be reprimanded or reproved, it makes an artist very
nervous,'' she said. Cossotti said she had been contested ``even
when I didn't deserve it but I had to put up with it.'' Castagnetti
put it this way: ``You either have more amorphous theaters where
the public does not participate, like the Met, where I have heard
some horrible performances without the public saying anything, or
you have La Scala, which prides itself in being competent.''
</P>
<P>
   Though today one is more likely to hear someone on the street
singing Janet Jackson's latest song than a Verdi aria (as was
common in the second half of the 19th century), Italians are still
proud of their rich opera heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The imminent demise of the standing-room clique made the front
pages of many Italian newspapers and prompted earnest editorials.
In the Rome-based paper Il Messaggero, the journalist Rita Sala
made a passionate appeal to La Scala's music director, Riccardo
Muti.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maestro Muti, do something,'' she pleaded. ``The Mediterranean
blood of Apulia and Naples that flows in your veins may have been
tempered by northern discipline, but it will certainly not accept
that the loggionisti be left outside the door. Protest, Maestro.''

NEW GABRIEL CD ISN'T BAD, BUT ISN'T ALL HIS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By DAVE FERMAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Come! Gather the children and light the fires! Shut off the TV
and order a pizza! It's ... ohmigosh ... a ``new Peter Gabriel
CD!''
</P>
<P>
   Whoo and, naturally, hoo! Let the parades begin!
</P>
<P>
   Only, um, it's not.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years after Gabriel's last studio CD _ the rather limp
``Us'' _ and 14 years since the landmark ``So,'' the wily former
lead singer of Genesis and hypertalented solo ``artiste'' has
released a soundtrack. Of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   Only, it only has his name and the CD's title, ``OVO,'' on the
spine. And to confuse things even more, although it's readily
available in the stores, it comes only as a high-priced ($30.30 at
Borders bookstore) import.
</P>
<P>
   And to confuse things even more, those who plunk down that $30
or so _ which comes to about 50 cents per minute _ will find that
our Peter sings lead on only a few tracks, the majority of the
singing being done (softly and/or slowly) by the Cocteau Twins'
Elizabeth Fraser, Woodstock hero Richie Havens, Paul Buchanan and
Irishman Iarla O' Lionaird, of Afro Celt Sound System. Gabriel _ or
PG as he's known in the credits _ busies himself on everything from
guitar to synthesizers to string arrangements to piano.
</P>
<P>
   Got all that? OK, then. Penned by Gabriel, ``OVO'' (the name of
an industrial empire) is a soundtrack to a ``visual and musical
experience'' put on by London's Millennium Dome, the liner notes
say. It tells the story of one family moving from past to present
to future, and trying to fuse nature and technology along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it works onstage, but the rather thin, vague story line
doesn't work. The upside is, this is not a bad CD, as long as
you're not expecting another ``Big Time'' or ``Sledgehammer,''
'cause believe me, you ain't gonna get 'em.
</P>
<P>
   What you do get is a mix of ambient, techno, Celtic (including a
genuine good ol' reel) a touch or three of Gabriel's own personal
brand of gospel, tons of different percussion instruments, violins,
synthesizers galore, and a rousing, 10-minute
let's-make-the-world-better finale, ``Make Tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The CD has a fistful of interesting songs, from ``The Time of
the Turning (Reprise)/The Weaver's Reel'' to the soft ``Father,
Son'' (Gabriel on lead vocals) to ``Downside-Up,'' to that finale.
And on the whole, ``OVO'' will please many who are adventurous
listeners, with some ACCS and other world-beat/Celtic artists (and
plenty of Gabriel CDs) in their collections. Those wanting ``So
Part II'' need to hunker down and wait. &QL;

SUMMER BOX OFFICE LACKED BUZZ 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ In the end, the summer movie season was neither as
lucrative as it looked at its onset nor as disastrous as it
appeared at its midpoint, but what exactly was it?
</P>
<P>
   In raw numbers, the movie season that ran from Memorial Day to
Labor Day, traditionally Hollywood's most lucrative period,
generated $2.7 billion at the box office, about $200 million less
than last year's record. Eleven of the films released earned more
than $100 million each, and one or two others may eventually
surpass that mark.
</P>
<P>
   Not so bad, on the face of it, but there were some disquieting
details beneath the surface.
</P>
<P>
   While overall box office looked fairly strong, even in
comparison with last year's sizzling pace, that was partly because
of an increase in ticket prices. In fact, attendance at movies was
down significantly, by 9 to 15 percent, depending on what the
National Association of Theater Owners concludes was the summer's
average ticket price, said Paul Dergarabedian, chairman of
Exhibitor Relations, a Los Angeles company that monitors box office
performance.
</P>
<P>
   While there were just as many $100 million movies this summer as
last, there was only one $200 million movie (``M:I-2,'' the
season's biggest hit at $214 million), compared with three last
summer (``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace,'' ``Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' and ``The Sixth Sense''). At the
same time, many movies that opened strongly this summer quickly
fell off.
</P>
<P>
   Most disturbing to many in the movie business was that people
just weren't talking about movies this summer. Last year, the
hottest topics of conversation and magazine covers were the new
``Star Wars'' prequel and the surprise success of ``The Sixth
Sense'' and ``The Blair Witch Project.'' This year, no movie seemed
to generate that kind of buzz.
</P>
<P>
   ``People's attention was on other things,'' Dergarabedian said.
``Last summer, to be included in the discussion you had to go see
`Blair Witch' or ``Sixth Sense.' This year, you had to watch
`Survivor' on television to be part of what everyone was talking
about. There was nothing on the order of a cultural phenomenon,
which is what you need to keep attendance from falling flat or
dipping. General malaise sort of overtook the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, some said, was that the summer of 1999 was
such an unusual one, kicked off by a frenzy over the ``Star Wars''
film and then powered by one major hit after another. It was
unfair, they said, to expect a subsequent summer to live up to
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The summer of '99 was an extraordinary summer, and I think
that to use it as a benchmark is difficult,'' said Robert G.
Friedman, vice chairman of the Paramount Motion Picture Group.
``You need to look over the last three years and, when you do, that
tells you that the summer of 2000 was a very good summer, equal to
or even better than '97 and '98.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman said he was not overly concerned about the attendance
drop. ``Our business is movie-driven,'' he said. ``It's not as
though people have gone to other forms of entertainment. It's not
as though we've lost them as future moviegoers. They've just
responded to the product that's been offered to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the summer movie season begins on Memorial Day,
but the trend in recent years has been to release big-budget,
summer-oriented films earlier and earlier. This year, for instance,
Ridley Scott's ``Gladiator,'' the summer's second-biggest hit at
$184 million, opened the first weekend in May, followed by Disney's
``Dinosaur'' ($136 million) in mid-May. Then came a record-breaking
Memorial Day weekend led by ``M:I-2'' and, shortly after, the
surprise success of Martin Lawrence's ``Big Momma's House'' ($116
million).
</P>
<P>
   After that, moviegoers seemed to get pickier, and it was not
until after a monthlong slump that the box office revived over the
Independence Day weekend, thanks in part to Wolfgang Peterson's
``Perfect Storm'' (at $178 million, the summer's third-biggest
hit). Other hits followed, like ``Scary Movie,'' a $19 million
spoof of teen-age slasher films that has earned nearly $150
million, and more expected successes like ``Nutty Professor 2: The
Klumps'' ($115 million) and ``X-Men'' ($153 million).
</P>
<P>
   By August, however, ticket sales had cooled again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom sort of fell out,'' Dergarabedian said. ``We ended
up the summer with 10 out of 15 weekends performing more poorly
than the same weekends last summer, and you just can't recover from
that.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem was that, except perhaps for ``Scary Movie,'' the
summer produced nothing like the kind of sleeper success enjoyed by
``Sixth Sense.'' Outside of a few films, notably Robert Zemeckis'
``What Lies Beneath'' (which has earned $137 million and is still
attracting audiences) and Clint Eastwood's ``Space Cowboys,'' the
summer releases did not seem to hold on at the box office week
after week, indicating that people were not telling friends to go
see them.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly disquieting to studios and theater owners is that
no movie coming out of the summer seems likely to run strongly into
September, as ``Sixth Sense'' did last year. With the Olympics
about to begin and few major releases in the immediate offing,
there are fears that it will not be until after the World Series
and the presidential election _ until November, that is, and the
release of the big holiday films _ that the box office will
recharge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been a good summer, though obviously not a great
summer,'' said Jim Tharp, head of distribution for DreamWorks. ``I
think it always goes back to the movies. Now, we have more
theaters, more conveniently located, more up-to-date and nicer to
be in, so that would seem to indicate you'd get more attendance.
But we didn't. So the issue has to be the movies.''

   NEW YORK _ ``It's a little late, but better late than never,''
said Anthony Quinn, talking in a Park Avenue hotel room about the
Hispanic Heritage Award he will receive in Washington tonight.
``I've only barely been accepted by that community.''
</P>

unconquerable life force he has projected in movies for more than
50 years. Retirement is not an option for the man who played Zorba

mother and father were both young kids fighting in the revolution,
and we always lived a Mexican life, even when we moved to Texas.
But to be Mexicans with the name of Quinn, that was not a nice
thing to do. If your name isn't Gonzalez or Montoya or whatever,
they just don't acknowledge you as a Mexican.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn's grandfather was an Irish immigrant to Mexico who married
a Mexican and started a family. ``My father, Francesco, had the
same problem I did with people making fun of him because of his
name,'' he said. ``And he joined the revolution to prove that he
was a good Mexican.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I must say that I think it was a good thing, if there is
such a thing as a good thing, that I wasn't accepted 100 percent by
the Mexican people. Because it drove me mad, it drove me absolutely
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Crazy enough, Quinn surmised, to become an actor.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic Heritage Awards, sponsored by a coalition of 34
national organizations, are meant to identify role models for
Hispanic youth. This year five people are to be honored with a gala
at the Kennedy Center Thursday night; the presentation will be
broadcast by NBC on Saturday night at 10.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, whose career includes at least 150 movies and two Academy
Awards (best supporting actor for ``Viva Zapata!'' in 1953 and
``Lust for Life'' in 1957), is being honored for his contributions
to the arts. The other honorees are Oscar Hijuelos, the novelist,
for literature; Dolores Huerta, a union organizer, for leadership,
Cruz Reynoso, a law professor, for education; and Sammy Sosa, the
Chicago Cubs slugger, for sports.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn has played relatively few Hispanic characters in his long
career. Beginning with his first credited screen performance, as a
Cheyenne warrior in Cecil B. DeMille's ``Plainsman'' in 1936, he
became Hollywood's all-purpose ethnic.
</P>
<P>
   He has played Chinese (``China Sky,'' 1945), Malaysian (``East
of Sumatra,'' 1953), Hun (``Attila,'' 1954), Eskimo (``The Savage
Innocents,'' 1959), Arab (``Lawrence of Arabia,'' 1962), Mongol
(``Marco the Magnificent,'' 1965), as well as countless Italians
(including the strongman Zampano for Federico Fellini in ``La
Strada'' in 1954) and a couple of conspicuous Greeks: the title
role in Michael Cacoyannis' ``Zorba the Greek'' (1964) and a
character based on Aristotle Onassis in ``The Greek Tycoon''
(1978).
</P>
<P>
   Quinn theorized that his confusion over his national identity
contributed to his desire to become a performer. ``One of the
reasons I did all the Greeks and Arab parts I did was because I was
trying to identify myself as a man of the world,'' he said. ``I
lived in Greece, in France, Iran and all over the world, Spain,
trying to find a niche where I would finally be accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   More confusion came over religious issues. Raised in an agnostic
household, Quinn said he was drawn to Catholicism when, as a
5-year-old shining shoes in front of a church in East Los Angeles,
he became intrigued by the spectacle he glimpsed through the doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went in, and I was absolutely amazed by the rituals. I fell
in love with the Latin chanting. I asked the priest, can I ever get
up on that stage? And he said, oh, yes, you can, and he took me
under his wing, and I studied with him until I was 14. He was
trying to make me a priest.''
</P>
<P>
   But Quinn's grandmother was stricken with cancer during this
time. He came home one day to find a group of evangelical
Pentacostalists praying over her, a sight he found shocking at
first but grew to accept, particularly when his grandmother showed
improvement and was eventually cured. He pledged his energies then
to the evangelicals, and soon became a popular preacher in the
church of Los Angeles' leading revivalist, Aimee Semple McPherson.
</P>
<P>
   It was a short step from the pulpit to the stage, but if Quinn
had found a career, he still had not settled his spiritual quest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to go to both churches, just like I was both an
American and a Mexican,'' he said, which led to some confusion when
the time came to define a religion for four of his children. ``I
had read an awful lot of books about religion, and I liked one very
much, Druidism. I said each one of our kids will go every Sunday
morning, and we'll sit by our favorite tree. We'll look out at the
ocean, and sit there for an hour and a half, and they'll find their
own religions. Consequently they all have different ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I love Druidism. When I go for a walk where I live in
Rhode Island, I know all the trees and all the birds, and they all
have names. There's a maple tree right in front of where I have
breakfast every morning, and I've fallen in love with it. It's just
a wonderful tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tree and I have now become close friends, and it tells me
its history. You can't help it at my age, you start thinking
strange things. And it's interesting, because now I can't kill any
animal, not even mosquitoes. It's stronger than I am.
</P>
<P>
   ``I discovered the property six years ago and bought it. I think
I bought it because I own a piece of ground in Greece, which Greece
has never really given me the title to. A hundred acres of ground
on the island of Rhodes that I bought from the Queen of Greece for
$50,000. I spent about a million dollars improving it. And then one
day the queen called me up and told me she had been thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me, `Tony, they will try to take the land away from
you, but never give it up.' And the government has never given me
permission to build a house there. When I think of Rhode Island, I
think of Rhodes, and I think that's why I bought it. It's a way of
getting back at the Greek politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn is the father of 13 children by 5 women. The youngest of
the children are 4 and 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had just had a heart operation when I bought it, and I think
I was reborn. I was just looking at myself and wondering who the
hell I was. I've discovered an awful lot about myself in the last
few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got angry at one of my sons, who wrote in the newspaper that
I was a different man, that he had seen me someplace and he thought
I had had a lobotomy. And I said, `Are you saying I needed a
lobotomy?' He said, `Pop, I've never seen you like this.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So I guess I've gotten younger. Some miracle happened, and I'm
now a younger man than I was 10 years ago. I'm still excited about
life, I'm still finding out wonderful things about life.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my will I had left that I wanted to be buried in Mexico.
They would take me up to the top of a mountain in Chihuahua and
leave me there, on a rock. I was really very comfortable about
that. But when I was there in April, a friend asked me if I wanted
to see the place, and he flew me out in a helicopter. It was 175
miles away. My wife said, `How the hell am I going to bring you
flowers when you're so far away?'
</P>
<P>
   ``So I had to think of another place. Now, it's Rhode Island.
Under the tree.''

5 TEENS ACCUSED OF KILLING FOOD DELIVERYMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It looked at first like a botched robbery: the owner
of a Chinese takeout place was lured late Friday night to a dark
dead-end street in Queens, where he was jumped and bludgeoned to
death. The killers left him with $600.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators said Wednesday that the real motive was
heartbreakingly mundane: he had been killed by a group of
teen-agers who wanted a free meal.
</P>
<P>
   The five teen-agers, who were all under arrest Wednesday and
scheduled to be arraigned overnight, had no criminal records and
were mostly from solidly middle-class families. Prosecutors said
the youths had been hungry and wanted to eat without paying, so
they used a cell phone to call in their $60 order _ General Tso's
chicken, shrimp egg foo young, chicken with broccoli and shrimp lo
mein _ to a vacant house on 176th Street in Springfield Gardens,
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   When the deliveryman, Jin-Sheng Liu, 44, arrived shortly before
midnight, he was jumped from behind, covered with a bedsheet and
pummeled to death with repeated head blows from fists and at least
one brick. As police officers converged on the scene, the group _
four boys and a girl, none older than 17 _ fled with a bag of food
to one of the boy's homes to eat, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of days, police began zeroing in on a group of
teen-agers who lived in the neighborhood around the vacant house at
130-19 176th St. The youngest, a skinny 14-year-old karate
enthusiast named Robert Savage, was arrested Tuesday as he was
riding his bicycle outside his parents' neatly-kept home on 130th
Avenue in Springfield Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   It was Savage, investigators said, who struck the most serious
blows, smashing the skull of Liu with a brick. Liu, the owner of
the Golden Wok at 192-15 Linden Boulevard in St. Albans, Queens,
was pronounced dead at the scene of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just did something, and it turned out ugly,'' said Robert
Eilam, 20, who lives across the street from Savage. Eilam said that
on Tuesday afternoon, a few hours before Savage was arrested, the
boy had started to cry for no apparent reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just acting as if he were so sorry about something,''
Eilam said.
</P>
<P>
   Savage and the other teen-agers are being prosecuted as adults.
Each faces multiple charges of second-degree murder, robbery and
criminal possession of a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a terribly tragic case,'' said Richard A. Brown, the
Queens district attorney, at a news conference Wednesday. ``Mr. Liu
was a hard-working immigrant who leaves behind a wife and two
children. He was killed without provocation and without reason. It
was a shocking crime, which leaves us all shaking our heads and
wondering why these kids would do what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities identified the other teen-agers as James Stone,
16, of 176-31 130th Ave.; Jamel Murphy, 17, of 219-05 131st Ave.;
Darryl Tyson, 17, of 132-07 178th St., and Stacy Royster, 17, of
257-52 148th Drive.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his age, Savage faces a maximum sentence of nine
years to life in prison, prosecutors said. The other four face up
to 25 years to life.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of Savage, Stone and Tyson either declined to comment
or did not respond to messages left at their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family just wants their son home _ that's it,'' said a man
sitting on the front steps of James Stone's home, five doors down
from Robert Savage's home.
</P>
<P>
   A man who would not give his name but identified himself as the
father of Jamel Murphy trembled during a brief interview Wednesday
in front of his house. ``I really don't have any words to describe
how I feel right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he planned to attend his son's arraignment, he replied:
``I'm not going to go, no. For me to go and show support for
something I don't support would be hypocritical.''
</P>
<P>
   Royster's grandmother, Anastasia Brown, said in an interview
Wednesday that her granddaughter had struggled in recent years with
mental illness that at times made her ``aggressive and out of
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who raised Royster after the girl's mother died about
eight years ago, said that in recent months Royster had seemed to
get her life back on track. Only last week, Brown said, she had
signed up for classes at Queensboro Community College.

<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Unveiling a book-length plan that hinges on
optimistic fiscal forecasts, Vice President Al Gore offered his
economic vision for the future Wednesday, painting an image of a
prosperous middle class that enjoys higher income, with more home
ownership, more high-tech jobs and more people going to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``My cause is hard-working, middle-class families,'' he asserted
at the beginning of his speech Wednesday here at Cleveland State
University.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Gore outlined a series of social and economic
goals that he said were attainable given the nation's current
prosperity, and he presented a mountain of supportable detail that
his campaign hopes will make Gov. George W. Bush's financial plan
pale by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   The speech reflected a shift in language and approach for Gore,
who has supplanted the ``working families'' he courted so
assiduously during the Democratic National Convention last month
with ``middle-class'' families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gore-Lieberman economic plan has one guiding purpose: to
help the middle-class families who have always been America's
purpose and pride, the people who pay the taxes, bear the burdens
and live the American dream,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   In his convention speech, Gore used the phrase ``working
families'' nine times. In Wednesday's speech, which was less than
half as long, he used the phrase ``middle-class'' 12 times and the
phrase ``working families'' only once.
</P>
<P>
   The release of Gore's economic blueprint reignited a debate with
Bush over who would best manage the projected budget surplus over
the next decade without ruining the economy. And Bush wasted little
time Wednesday attacking Gore's plan, saying the vice president had
made so many spending promises that a Gore administration would
devour the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   To deflect such perceptions, Gore included in his 191-page plan
a pledge to set aside $300 billion as a hedge against overly
optimistic fiscal projections. Aside from the rainy day fund,
Gore's plan is largely a synthesis of many specific programs he has
described over the last several months. But Wednesday was the first
time the vice president had drawn all of these stray threads
together into a broader theme.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his 10 goals were to: eliminate the debt by 2012;
protect the Social Security and Medicare surpluses; double the
number of families that have more than $50,000 in savings; reduce
income taxes on the typical family to the lowest level in 50 years;
raise family income by a third over the next decade; enable seven
in 10 families to own their own homes; increase the number of
people who go to college; reduce poverty to below 10 percent for
the first time since poverty statistics were kept in 1959; cut the
gap between wages earned by men and women; and create 10 million
new high-tech jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Some aspects of the plan beget others. For example, eliminating
the debt by 2012 would reduce interest rates and thus make school
loans more affordable so that more people could attend college.
</P>
<P>
   The economic blueprint that Gore offered Wednesday is a road map
of middle-class life. It envisions expanded income in continuing
boom times, with more people going to college and working in
well-paying, high-tech jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's focus on the middle class is something of a turn away
from the more combative populist language that has preoccupied him
for weeks. It also reflects in part the arrival of a new pollster,
Stanley Greenberg, who has written extensively about the middle
class and helped Bill Clinton capture that broad middle swatch of
voters in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers said he deliberately used the phrase ``middle
class'' in Wednesday's speech because he was also talking about
reducing the number of people in poverty and wanted to distinguish
between the two.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president has been using the ``middle class'' in
speeches for days now, and has been losing ``working families.''
The blueprint he released Wednesday was titled ``Prosperity for
America's Families.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster who at one time advised Newt
Gingrich, the former House speaker, on word choice and language,
said that Gore appeared to have moved deliberately away from
``working families'' to the ``middle class'' to broaden his reach.
He said that voters perceived ``working families'' as applying to
young couples and excluding people who were retired or about to
retire _ a huge block of voters who are especially important
because they tend to go to the polls in larger numbers than younger
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battleground in this election is for the 30-somethings and
the near-retirees,'' Luntz said. As a result, he said, based on his
work conducting focus groups with voters for MSNBC, the phrase
``working families'' was working against Gore, not only with its
connotations of youth but its connotations of class distinctions
that Americans are loathe to acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan, particularly the desire to raise family income by
one-third over the next decade, assumes an annual growth rate in
incomes of 2.9 percent _ a fairly ambitious goal, even though the
most recent figures available show that from 1997 to 1998, median
family income grew 3.3 percent, to $46,737 from $45,262. Gore
budget advisers acknowledged the country had never sustained such
growth over a 10-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told his audience to ``read my plan,'' a pointed reference
to the infamous command by former President George Bush, father of
the Republican nominee, to ``read my lips: no new taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My plan wasn't built on cross-your-fingers economics that says
we can give more to the people who already have the most and then
just hope the benefits trickle down to the middle class,'' Gore
said, again contrasting himself with the Reagan-Bush era.
</P>
<P>
   And in an effort to demonstrate that his approach was fiscally
conservative, Gore said he would set aside $300 billion in a
rainy-day fund, a hedge against overly optimistic surplus
projections.
</P>
<P>
   ``If today's economic forecasts fall short, this new reserve
fund will guarantee that we will not have to cut education or
health care,'' Gore said Wednesday. ``And unlike the promises made
on the other side, we won't be running deficits and endangering
America's prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reischauer, President Clinton's former director of the
Office of Management and Budget and now an analyst with the Urban
Institute, said that the plan, especially the rainy-day fund, was
``fiscally prudent and politically sound.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Gore's goals would essentially ``fall in his lap''
if the economy continued to expand, and results like that appealed
to most voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of people view themselves as middle class,''
he said. ``Those who are not in the middle class have aspirations
to be there and they view those aspirations as realistic, so you
don't offend anybody.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ President Clinton opened the summit meeting of
world leaders at the United Nations on Wednesday, urging the huge
gathering to prepare the institution for a new age in which
international forces will have to reach regularly and rapidly
inside national boundaries to protect threatened people.
</P>
<P>
   With his own time in the front rank of the 149 world leaders
gathered here drawing to an end, Clinton also used the moment to
try to settle some of the disputes that have dogged his presidency,
from the Middle East to Russia to Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The president met separately into the evening with Prime
Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and then with the Palestinian leader,
Yasser Arafat, in hopes of picking up the broken pieces of the
peace agreement that came tantalizingly close at Camp David in
July. Clinton warned that ``like all life's chances,'' the moment
for an accord ``is fleeting and about to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   And he sparred anew with Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, who
is using the gathering here to propose a ban on military uses of
space, another effort to terminate U.S. efforts to develop a
national missile defense. Clinton's aides gave Putin a summary of
U.S. intelligence gathered during the Kursk submarine disaster,
which suggests that Putin's own naval forces may have misled him in
the days after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was deliberately vague on the question of when the
United Nations should step into civil wars or ethnic and religious
disputes _ an argument that has come up repeatedly during his
presidency. ``These conflicts present us with a stark challenge,''
he said. ``Are they part of the scourge the U.N. was established to
prevent? If so, we must respect sovereignty and territorial
integrity, but still find a way to protect people as well as
borders.''
</P>
<P>
   Just hours before he spoke, three U.N. relief workers were
killed in West Timor, apparently by Indonesian militia forces. The
news, underscoring the risks to U.N. workers as they insert
themselves into uncontrolled disputes, put a chill on the opening
ceremony. As the session began, the U.N. secretary-general, Kofi
Annan, called for a minute of silence to remember the three
international aid workers, as Indonesia's president, Abdurrahman
Wahid, struggling with a clear erosion of his authority at home,
sat in the hall.
</P>
<P>
   With the East Side of Manhattan at a near standstill while a
parade of prime ministers and presidents zoomed through the police
lines, Clinton clearly relished one of his last hurrah's as
president in front of what the United Nations called the largest
gathering of world leaders in history. Rarely has he had a chance
to talk to both adversaries and allies at the same moment, a group
as diverse as President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea and President
Fidel Castro of Cuba, who listened to Clinton but never got close
enough to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stayed in the hall after his speech and, because of an
unexpected change in the order of speakers, heard President
Mohammad Khatami of Iran, with whom the United States still has no
formal dialogue, talk about the clash of Islamic and Western
cultures.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright sat
listening at the back of the huge hall, Khatami declared that in
coming years the world could no longer be ruled by ``monopolies of
power and capital,'' a clear reference to the United States. It was
one of a series of expressions of frustration about America's
global power that emerged as a subtext of the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Clinton spoke of the need to intervene strongly
when a nation's leaders abuse their own people, the president of
China, Jiang Zemin, described a very different concept of how the
world should operate. ``Respect for each other's independence and
sovereignty is vital to the maintenance of world peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Striking a theme often heard from Chinese leaders who fear that
intervention in Kosovo or East Timor could provide the precedent
for one day intervening in Tibet or Taiwan, Jiang added: ``Dialogue
and cooperation in the field of human rights must be conduucted on
the basis of respect for state sovereignty. Without sovereignty,
there will be no human rights to speak of.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of the growing suspicions about America's use of
that power _ or perhaps because of the constant conflict between
the United Nations and Washington over the payment of dues to the
organization _ Clinton did not receive the kind of standing ovation
that greeted him in 1998. During his speech, he made an oblique
reference to Washington's $1.7 billion in arrears to the United
Nations, saying that as the organization expands its missions,
``all these things come with a price tag, and all nations,
including the United States, must pay it.''
</P>
<P>
   He also took a clear shot at conservative Republicans who have
attacked the United Nations, saying, ``Those in my country or
elsewhere who believe we can do without the United Nations, or
impose our will upon it, misread history and misunderstand the
future.''

   A federal judge in New York ruled Wednesday that MP3.com had
willfully infringed the copyrights of the Universal Music Group by
making its CDs available for play over the Internet and ordered the
online music site to pay damages that could total $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   In a much anticipated decision, US District Judge Jed S. Rakoff
said he wanted to send a strong warning to online music
distributors who ``may have a misconception that, because their
technology is somewhat novel, they are somehow immune from the
ordinary applications of laws of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to understand that the law's domain knows no such
limits,'' the judge added.
</P>
<P>
   Rakoff set damages at $25,000 for each CD of Universal Music
Group, the world's biggest record company, it made available on the
site. The exact number of disks involved and the total award will
be decided during a hearing in November.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com, based in San Diego, said it would appeal the ruling.
The company had argued that it could be forced out business if
damages exceeded $500 per CD. Trading of MP3.com shares was halted
at $7.88.
</P>
<P>
   Rakoff's ruling was another victory in the Old Economy's
campaign against the Internet community's attempts to redefine
intellectual property. Corporations that make music and movies
continue to wage war against new technologies that allow widespread
sharing of their content.
</P>
<P>
   In July, a federal judge in San Francisco issued an order that
could have shut down Napster Inc.'s music-sampling service. The
injunction is on hold pending an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent victories, the recording industry hasn't
shown signs of letting up the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Scour Inc., for example, was recently sued by both the Recording
Industry Association of America and the Motion Picture Association
of America. Backed by Hollywood agent Michael Ovitz, Scour hopes to
bring free music, movies, and pictures to the Internet public. But
the lawsuit is making potential investors nervous, said analyst
Eric Scheirer of Forrester Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can chalk that up to the chilling effect,'' Scheirer said.
``The content industry is still in the driver's seat _ even on the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Scheirer and other industry observers say they were surprised by
the tenor of Wednesday's ruling and concerned about its impact on
start-ups that want to change the way consumers buy and listen to
music.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Lemley, a professor of intellectual property law at the
University of California at Berkeley's law school, said the
recording industry has spent too much time in court and needs to
find its own way of distributing digital music.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't just make digital music go away by suing everyone
who's involved in it,'' Lemley said. ``The demand is too great.''
</P>
<P>
   In April Rakoff decided that MP3.com had infringed the
copyrights owned by Universal, a unit of Seagram Co. Ltd., and four
other big record labels. MP3.com settled with all but Universal,
taking a $150 million charge related to the lawsuits in its second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Universal had urged Rakoff to award Universal as
much as $450 million, claiming MP3.com had duplicated as many as
10,000 of the firm's CDs. MP3.com says the number is closer to
4,700.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for MP3.com said earlier this week that a huge
penalty would be a ``death sentence'' to the company. But the
judge, who wanted to sent a strong message to the Internet
community, warned that the fine could start at $118 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential for huge profits in the rapidly expanding world
of the Internet is the lure that tempted an otherwise generally
responsible company like MP3.com to break the law,'' Rakoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone believes MP3.com will be flattened by a huge fine.
Jon Zittrain, a cyberlaw professor at Harvard Law School, noted
that the company raised $344 million in an initial public offering
in July of 1999. Wednesday, MP3.com had a market capitalization of
$584 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't necessarily break the bank,'' Zittrain said. ``But
you lose momentum. . . . At best, it's a rollercoaster ride for
them that increases the pressure of accommodation (with the record
industry) of some kind.''
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry cheered Rakoff's ruling. ``This should
send a message that there are consequences when a business
recklessly disregards the copyright law,'' said Cary Sherman,
general counsel for the Recording Industry Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   Howard King, an attorney who represents Metallica in the music
group's battle against Napster, said the decision also bodes well
for his clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another judge enforcing the copyright laws,'' King said.
``No matter what the technology, our laws still respect the rights
of copyright owners.''
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com has said it will appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that everyone should have the right to listen to
the music they purchase, even if it's on the Internet,'' said
Michael Robertson, chairman and chief executive officer of MP3.com.
``While we respect the court, we disagree with the court's decision
and we look forward to taking our case to the Court of Appeals.''

 UNITED NATIONS: the future.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shortly after Clinton spoke, he met in the U.N. building with
the president of Vietnam, Tan Duc Luong. He reassured him that a
recent trade accord between the United States and Vietnam would
remain a top priority for the United States, even though he has
decided not to try to win approval of the agreement from Congress
this year. The two men also discussed Clinton's desire to visit
Vietnam before the end of his presidency, which would make him the
first U.S. president to set foot on Vietnamese soil since the end
of the war nearly 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   While the White House made no announcement of such plans, senior
administration officials say that Clinton is likely to visit
Vietnam just before Thanksgiving. He is planning to attend the
annual Asian economic summit in Brunei, and would make a symbolic _
and highly emotional _ visit to Hanoi on the same trip.
</P>
<P>
   Such individual meetings and initiatives always dominate the
opening of the U.N. session in September. But the stated purpose of
this vast summit meeting of leaders is much broader: to set new
priorities and directions for the United Nations, which at age 55
seems creaky and unprepared for a host of new challenges.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the leaders are scheduled to sign a millennium
declaration, calling for a new peacekeeping structure _ a report to
Annan calls for a strengthened corps of commanders in New York,
ready to organize peacekeeping operations in a week or two. It also
sets goals for reducing poverty and illiteracy during the next 15
years, and contains carefully crafted language about guiding
economic globalization so that it benefits the poor as much as the
rich, and small, uncompetitive nations as much as the developed
world.
</P>
<P>
   But as with any document that is signed by so many, the language
is so watered down that discerning its specific meaning is
difficult at best. And it is particularly difficult to pin down the
United Nations' role in managing economic globalization and
development. More and more, that role has fallen to the
institutions that were created at the end of World War II to manage
the world economy _ the World Bank, which focuses on poverty, and
the International Monetary Fund, which seeks to prevent and manage
economic crises.
</P>
<P>
   Their growing role leaves the United Nations increasingly on the
sidelines when it comes to the crucial questions of economic
development _ who gets capital and under what conditions _ and even
their efforts are frequently overshadowed by the billions in
private capital that now slosh through the emerging markets on a
daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   In such an environment, the United Nations' role is chiefly
hortatory. And because the United Nations does not impose the kind
of conditions on its aid that the World Bank and IMF require, from
fiscal prudence to Western-style accounting methods _ it has become
the forum in which many nations want to move the debate over the
rules of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   This has been evident all week on the streets near the United
Nations. There have been globalization teach-ins, and constant talk
inside the United Nations about the growing inequality between rich
and poor nations. But the protests on the streets have been pale
compared to those that rocked the Seattle meeting of the World
Trade Organization late last year, and even those who came here to
make their case were largely drowned out Thursday by the
motorcades, the speeches and the massive security operation.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Documents released Wednesday provided additional
evidence that Bridgestone/Firestone and possibly Ford Motor Co.
knew about a pattern of tire failures long before a recall was
announced in August, and lawmakers began calling for tighter
regulation of the auto and tire industries.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosures came in a long day of hearings on Capitol Hill
in which Masatoshi Ono, the chairman and chief executive of
Bridgestone/Firestone, the American unit of Bridgestone Corp. of
Japan, read apologies in halting English. ``I come before you to
apologize to you, the American people and especially to the
families who have lost loved ones in these terrible rollover
accidents,'' Ono told senators in the morning, squeezing in a
reference to what some tire industry officials describe as an
excessive tendency of Ford Explorers to roll over when they lose a
tire.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats alike refused to accept Firestone's
apologies or each company's efforts to blame the other. One after
another, members of Congress accused both corporations of having at
least blithely ignored public safety, and perhaps of having
conspired to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ford and Firestone had at a minimum a moral obligation to make
sure that the products they sell to the American public and other
people in other countries are safe,'' said Sen. Richard Shelby,
R-Ala. ``And yet they both failed to bring this issue to consumers'
and the federal government's attention, at the cost of dozens of
lives, I am afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also called for a larger budget for safety regulators
and proposed federal criminal penalties for any future cases in
which companies might be found to have knowingly sold products with
lethal defects.
</P>
<P>
   After Ono's statement, Ford's chief executive, jabbed back at
Firestone. Jacques Nasser, Ford's chief executive, said in prepared
remarks, ``This is a tire issue, not a vehicle issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But the central issue of the hearings was the question of what
each company know and when.
</P>
<P>
   House investigators showed reporters a Firestone financial
statement indicating that the tire maker had found a pattern of
tire problems earlier than the company has admitted in the past. In
the document, dated Jan. 19, 2000, Firestone's financial managers
calculated that $1.84 million of the $2.88 million in legal claims
against the company for tread separation problems were for tires
made at one of its 10 North American tire factories.
</P>
<P>
   The statement identified Firestone's factory in Decatur, Ill.,
as making the problem tires. Firestone is now recalling and
replacing 6.5 million light truck tires installed mainly on Ford
Explorers, including all 15-inch Wilderness tires made in Decatur
for the Explorer since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Before that statement was disclosed, Gary Crigger, Firestone's
executive vice president of business planning, told a Senate panel
that Firestone had immediately notified regulators in early August
upon becoming aware of a problem.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rocco arrived at Bonnie's K9 Swim Center in Manhattan
prancing with excitement, a bandana knotted around his thick furry
neck and metal wheels strapped to his withered hind legs. A
10-year-old German shepherd, Rocco had lymphoma last summer,
followed by a ruptured disk requiring emergency surgery the week
before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny Addamo, Rocco's owner, lowered the 90-pound dog into the
waiting arms of Jodi Richard, who was submerged to her shoulders in
87-degree water and ready to right Rocco as he started to roll and
submerge. The pool's surface, lightly dusted with dog hair, boiled
around Rocco's flailing front paws as Richard, the owner of
Bonnie's K9, a new physical therapy center for dogs, held onto his
hips.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, physical therapy was mainly for people. Pets,
even when valued as guardians and companions, received limited
medical care and were often euthanized when they were deemed too
old, too infirm or too expensive to treat. Today, as pets become
more prized, and a booming economy creates more discretionary
income, pet care might include a $400 customized weight-loss
program at a health spa.
</P>
<P>
   While the yellow pages bulge with listings for fancy poodle
parlors, the latest pet spas are beginning to offer the same
therapies available to humans _ from electro-stimulation to
underwater treadmills. With fees kept low to attract all comers (an
average $15 an hour for massage or swim therapy), these new therapy
centers are only beginning to meet the demand of pet owners eager
not only to indulge but also to save their animals.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the new breed of pet spa is Bonnie's K9, which opened
last month in Chelsea and offers swim therapy, massage and
acupuncture as well as homemade organic dog food. Richard invested
about $500,000 (with contributions from her husband, Dwight
Merriman, co-founder of DoubleClick, an Internet advertising firm)
to open the 2,000-square-foot center. It is named after their
German shepherd, which they rescued from a puppy mill. Bonnie had
been caged for the first years of her life for breeding and, as a
result, is paralyzed in her hind legs.
</P>
<P>
   Richard, who is earning a veterinarian technician degree (the
equivalent of a nursing degree), has two full-time employees and
works most nights until 8. One evening last week, as she handed her
panting client a natural dog biscuit, and ate one too, she said,
``Some people think I'm crazy to be doing this,'' but ``it's
extremely rewarding.''
</P>
<P>
   Veterinarians refer their clients to Richard, who treats dogs
suffering from hip dysplasia, degenerative spinal disorders, cancer
and other diseases resulting from dogs living longer than in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were overwhelmed when we found out that Rocco was probably
never going to walk again,'' said Dr. Dina Addamo, a resident
doctor at Mount Sinai in Manhattan who had to work extra night
shifts to help pay over $10,000 for Rocco's cancer treatments.
``We'd do practically anything. He deserves it,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Operating on a much larger scale, on farmland 50 miles east of
Pittsburgh, is the Baden-Baden of New Age pet spas, the sprawling
Cozy Inn Pet Resort and Spa. Here, one afternoon last week, workers
led a 1-year-old black Labrador runt named Zoey in for a
therapeutic swim session. Unable to stand because of a congenital
affliction caused by overbreeding, Zoey is shaky as a newborn foal.
But once in the pool, she takes off like the swimmer she's supposed
to be. Afterward an attendant wraps Zoey in a clean towel and
returns her to a cage with a private door flap leading into the
yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time you took a dog with problems out and shot it,''
said Carol Boerio-Croft, the founder of Cozy Inn. ``Now dogs have a
much better lifestyle. They're not disposable anymore; they're part
of the household.''
</P>
<P>
   Boerio-Croft, whose husband, Dr. Henry L. Croft Jr., is a
veterinarian, was among the first to sense a growth industry in the
making. Fourteen years ago she created a boarding facility for pets
and offered luxury amenities like facial massages and off-leash
nature walks. Three years ago, she added the Mozart wing, a
step-down facility for postsurgical and geriatric dogs named after
her terrier mutt, which died of cancer. The $2 million complex is
steeped in pet-theme memorabilia, from plaster dog statues on the
lawn to ``101 Dalmatian'' clocks. There are two indoor pools: one
is shaped like a bone; the other is a whirlpool with the shape of a
dog paw.
</P>
<P>
   Business is brisk, with about 250 dogs on the grounds every day.
Rates average $16 a day, generating enough income to allow the
Crofts and an investor to underwrite a $3 million center in
Pittsburgh, which is to open this winter. They say they hope it
will serve as a prototype for a pet-care chain offering everything
from vacation centers to education and spa treatments.
</P>
<P>
   In Annandale, Va., Stan Marks, a real estate broker, was
inspired to build a rehabilitation clinic for small animals after
he was unable to find the care he wanted for his 14-year old German
shepherd, who died four months ago from degenerative bone disease.
The Royal Treatment center, which is opening in six months, will
offer conditioning and weight-loss programs, hydrotherapy and
range-of-motion exercises.
</P>
<P>
   ``People today are willing to go any distance for their pets,''
said Marks, who spent over $5,000 on hip replacements for his dog.
``I'm the perfect example. And there are a lot of `me's' out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Although physical therapy has been used on thoroughbred
racehorses and greyhounds for at least 20 years, it is new to the
world of pets. Determined to improve and prolong the lives of their
animals, the aging Me Generation has become the Me and My
Four-Legged Companion Generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are demanding these services,'' said Marks, who is
already planning to open a second center next year in suburban
Washington. ``It's a whole new area of veterinary medicine, and it
can't move fast enough to meet the demand.''
</P>
<P>
   A survey last year of 1,200 pet owners by the American Animal
Hospital Association found that pet owners were more likely to take
their animals to the veterinarian on a regular basis than they were
to see a doctor themselves. (Eighty-four percent of the respondents
called themselves Mom or Dad when talking to their pets.)
</P>
<P>
   The urge to devote special care, from expensive prepared foods
to lifesaving surgery, focuses more on dogs than on cats, perhaps
because cats live longer (16 years on average). Large dogs are
considered old when they are 8. Modern medicine and an insistent
clientele, has stretched that natural limit.
</P>
<P>
   Shelly and Jack Galati of Riverdale, N.Y., have a 15{-year-old
Labrador named Sydney that has been undergoing acupuncture for
three years. When Sydney recently started falling on slippery
floors, they started looking for additional treatments. ``We know
she's old, and we don't expect her to get better,'' Galati said.
``We just want to keep her as she is.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Veterinarians are traditionally accustomed more to emergency
medical care (``Help! My dog ate the remote control!'') than to
prevention and wellness care. The American Veterinary Medical
Association has been cautious in embracing treatments like
acupuncture and physical therapy, although it agrees that there is
anecdotal evidence supporting their benefits. The veterinarians who
recommend physical therapies say that animals tend to respond to
treatment better than humans because they don't resist their
exercise regimes and they have a higher threshold of pain, making
it possible to rebuild muscular tissue more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the newness of the business, there are no degree
programs or licensing requirements for pet physical therapists.
``It's a bit of a problem,'' said Dr. Robert B. Parker, head of the
surgery department at the Animal Medical Center, a highly regarded
animal hospital in Manhattan. ``It involves a lot of issues on the
front lines of what should be done by a licensed veterinarian and
what a lay person should do.''
</P>
<P>
   The insurance industry, which has been curbing reimbursements
for physical therapy for humans, has inadvertently supplied a
talent pool. Two years ago, the American Physical Therapist
Association started helping members explore animal physical therapy
``in part because insurance is not reimbursing people for continued
physical therapy,'' said Cheryl Riegger-Krugh, who runs the
organization's special interest group on animal physical therapy.
She explained that while people without insurance coverage tend to
drop out of treatment, people with pets pay for it with their own
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Boerio-Croft, the owner of Cozy Inn, has gone the limit herself.
She spent $85,000 to fly her Irish wolfhound to Colorado for a bone
marrow transplant with limited results. ``I bought him 8 months,''
she said, ``And I was happy to get it.''

 &HT;    CLINTON REVIVES PEACE TALKS IN MEETINGS WITH ARAFAT, BARAK
 &HT;    With CLINTON-UN-0907.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fanning the embers of the smoldering Mideast peace
process, President Clinton huddled Wednesday night with Israeli and
Palestinian leaders, reviving negotiations that collapsed in July.
</P>
<P>
   With Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat engaged once again in diplomacy, White
House spokesman Joseph Lockhart said a Sept. 13 deadline for
agreement was likely to be missed. The danger of a breakdown over
that date, however, appears to have abated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that both sides, and the United States included, are
focused on getting an agreement and finding a way to bridge the
differences,'' Lockhart said, ``and are not particularly focused on
a calender date in next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart made clear that the meetings produced no breakthroughs
_ none had been expected _ and he said the leaders had scheduled no
further meetings, though he didn't rule out additional talks as
early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process has not broken down,'' Lockhart said. ``It's
ongoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's meetings were Clinton's first with Arafat and Barak
since his efforts to press them toward a peace accord collapsed in
July at the Camp David presidential retreat in western Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   There, two weeks of summitry fell apart over the issue of
Jerusalem, a city holy to Christians, Jews and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, Clinton warned that time was slipping away on
the prospects for a near-term Mideast peace accord. Barak is in a
precarious political position at home and could face a
parliamentary vote as early as the end of October on whether to
dissolve his government.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid for urgency, Clinton appealed for global backing for
his efforts to craft a peace treaty acceptable to Barak, Arafat and
their respective peoples.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need your support now, more than ever, to take the hard
risks for peace,'' Clinton said in remarks to the United Nations
General Assembly, the body's annual conference of international
leaders. ``They have the chance to do it. But, like all life's
chances, it is fleeting and about to pass. There is not a moment to
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Clinton met for an hour with Barak in a
Manhattan luxury hotel. Following that, Clinton met for an hour and
40 minutes with Arafat, Lockhart told reporters traveling with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Clinton met into the evening with Jordan's King
Abdullah then, separately, with Crown Prince Abdallah of Saudi
Arabia, to discuss ways the Arab world might support the peace
process and to hear their ideas on a possible path forward.
</P>
<P>
   In their Wednesday meetings, Clinton and the two Mideast leaders
_ Arafat and Barak _ discussed new possibilities for bridging their
gaps over the future of disputed portions of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president and the two leaders went through a number of
ideas,'' Lockhart said, though declining to be specific.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has demanded full sovereignty over East Jerusalem, the
center of Palestinian social, cultural and economic life.
</P>
<P>
   The territory, though, which Israel seized in the 1967
Arab-Israeli war, contains sites holy to all three major religions
and holds deep historic meaning to Israelis and Palestinians alike.
</P>
<P>
   Barak offered Arafat partial sovereignty over the disputed land,
but Arafat rejected that formulation.
</P>
<P>
   In their own U.N. remarks on Wednesday, Arafat and Barak sent
mixed signals.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat hinted, for instance, that he was willing to drop his
threat to declare Palestinian statehood on Sept. 13, so long as he
sees a chance for progress on the diplomatic front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our friends and brothers consider that reaching a
final settlement requires allowing an additional chance for these
efforts to succeed,'' Arafat said, adding that he would take up
that prospect at a meeting of the Palestinian Central Council this
weekend in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   In the same speech, though, Arafat blasted Israel, casting the
Jewish state as the villain in the oft-tortured peace process.

<P>
   ``We are confronting Israeli attempts at the Judaization of
Jerusalem,'' said Arafat, ``land confiscation, the building of
illegal Israeli settlements, the siege imposed upon Bethlehem, and
the lack of honest and accurate implementation of the agreements
signed by Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat went on to characterize Jerusalem as ``the cradle of
Christ and the site of Prophet Mohammed's ascension to heaven,''
leaving out the city's even longer history as the center of Judaism
and accusing Israel of attempts at ``monopolizing'' the ancient
city.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, for his part, stressed the 3,000-year history of Judaism
in Jerusalem, quoting Old Testament scripture, even as he called
upon Arafat to embrace compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerusalem, the eternal capital of Israel, now calls for a
peace of honor, of courage and of brotherhood,'' said Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that Jerusalem is also sacred to Muslims and
Christians the world over and cherished by our Palestinian
neighbors,'' he said. ``A true peace will reflect all these bonds.
Jerusalem will remain united and open to all who love her.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fanning the embers of the smoldering Mideast peace
process, President Clinton huddled Wednesday night with Israeli and
Palestinian leaders, reviving negotiations that collapsed in July.
</P>
<P>
   With Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat engaged once again in diplomacy, White
House spokesman Joseph Lockhart said a Sept. 13 deadline for
agreement was likely to be missed. The danger of a breakdown over
that date, however, appears to have abated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that both sides, and the United States included, are
focused on getting an agreement and finding a way to bridge the
differences,'' Lockhart said, ``and are not particularly focused on
a calender date in next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart made clear that the meetings produced no breakthroughs
_ none had been expected _ and he said the leaders had scheduled no
further meetings, though he didn't rule out additional talks as
early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process has not broken down,'' Lockhart said. ``It's
ongoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's meetings were Clinton's first with Arafat and Barak
since his efforts to press them toward a peace accord collapsed in
July at the Camp David presidential retreat in western Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   There, two weeks of summitry fell apart over the issue of
Jerusalem, a city holy to Christians, Jews and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, Clinton warned that time was slipping away on
the prospects for a near-term Mideast peace accord. Barak is in a
precarious political position at home and could face a
parliamentary vote as early as the end of October on whether to
dissolve his government.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid for urgency, Clinton appealed for global backing for
his efforts to craft a peace treaty acceptable to Barak, Arafat and
their respective peoples.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need your support now, more than ever, to take the hard
risks for peace,'' Clinton said in remarks to the United Nations
General Assembly, the body's annual conference of international
leaders. ``They have the chance to do it. But, like all life's
chances, it is fleeting and about to pass. There is not a moment to
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Clinton met for an hour with Barak in a
Manhattan luxury hotel. Following that, Clinton met for an hour and
40 minutes with Arafat, Lockhart told reporters traveling with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Clinton met into the evening with Jordan's King
Abdullah then, separately, with Crown Prince Abdallah of Saudi
Arabia, to discuss ways the Arab world might support the peace
process and to hear their ideas on a possible path forward.
</P>
<P>
   In their Wednesday meetings, Clinton and the two Mideast leaders
_ Arafat and Barak _ discussed new possibilities for bridging their
gaps over the future of disputed portions of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president and the two leaders went through a number of
ideas,'' Lockhart said, though declining to be specific.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has demanded full sovereignty over East Jerusalem, the
center of Palestinian social, cultural and economic life.
</P>
<P>
   The territory, though, which Israel seized in the 1967
Arab-Israeli war, contains sites holy to all three major religions
and holds deep historic meaning to Israelis and Palestinians alike.
</P>
<P>
   Barak offered Arafat partial sovereignty over the disputed land,
but Arafat rejected that formulation.
</P>
<P>
   In their own U.N. remarks on Wednesday, Arafat and Barak sent
mixed signals.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat hinted, for instance, that he was willing to drop his
threat to declare Palestinian statehood on Sept. 13, so long as he
sees a chance for progress on the diplomatic front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our friends and brothers consider that reaching a
final settlement requires allowing an additional chance for these
efforts to succeed,'' Arafat said, adding that he would take up
that prospect at a meeting of the Palestinian Central Council this
weekend in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   In the same speech, though, Arafat blasted Israel, casting the
Jewish state as the villain in the oft-tortured peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confronting Israeli attempts at the Judaization of
Jerusalem,'' said Arafat, ``land confiscation, the building of
illegal Israeli settlements, the siege imposed upon Bethlehem, and
the lack of honest and accurate implementation of the agreements
signed by Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat went on to characterize Jerusalem as ``the cradle of
Christ and the site of Prophet Mohammed's ascension to heaven,''
leaving out the city's even longer history as the center of Judaism
and accusing Israel of attempts at ``monopolizing'' the ancient
city.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, for his part, stressed the 3,000-year history of Judaism
in Jerusalem, quoting Old Testament scripture, even as he called
upon Arafat to embrace compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerusalem, the eternal capital of Israel, now calls for a
peace of honor, of courage and of brotherhood,'' said Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that Jerusalem is also sacred to Muslims and
Christians the world over and cherished by our Palestinian
neighbors,'' he said. ``A true peace will reflect all these bonds.
Jerusalem will remain united and open to all who love her.''

LIFE CONDENSED INTO A LIST

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Reading the telephone book used to be a joke until
List magazine, also exclusively a collection of lists, appeared in
June. Four thousand copies later (at $15 a pop), the new magazine's
last laugh is the next item on the editors' list: Issue 2 arrives
in October. The white pages, at least, are free.
</P>
<P>
   Detractors and admirers _ along with List's creative directors,
Lisa Ano, 28, and Serge Becker, 39, who are designers by background
_ like to think of List as a kind of literary Armageddon: the
arguments of the traditional magazine piece stripped to a corrosive
litany of disinterested facts. It might be a perfect model for the
new popular magazine: you can't do anything but skim it.
</P>
<P>
   In 40 lists, List/01 includes topics that are better listed than
explained (supermodel day rates), topics explained by their listing
(international illiteracy rates) and topics explained in a list
(death row inmates' last meals: John Wayne Gacy ate four courses of
fried foods, with fresh strawberries for dessert).
</P>
<P>
   Ano and Becker create List at Can Resources, an architecture and
design company, where they work with Derek Sanders, 39, an
architect, on projects like the new Standard hotel in Los Angeles.
Ano, a graphic designer, previously assisted Tibor Kalman at M&AMP;Co.
</P>
<P>
   Becker, a restaurant and club entrepreneur _ List is his idea _
is a list maker from way back, as in guest lists and A-lists. He
helped create MK, Bowery Bar and Joe's Pub. With a resume that
lopes like a velvet rope, Becker understands the power of
exclusivity, from the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list to Tina Brown's
``Talk Magazine Launch'' Liberty Island party list: he published
both in List.
</P>
<P>
   Visited at its Chinatown offices, two flights above a sewing
shop, List previewed its next proudly engineered controversy _
List/02 _ an advertorial vehicle created instead as
``edvertisements.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine will portray 12 personalities, like Bryce P.
Wilson, a music producer, and Lizzie Grubman, a publicist, in
visual lists or trademark litanies based on the brand-name products
they consume, excerpted from responses to a 138-item questionnaire
on items from art to underwear. Makers of the products listed will
be invited, the editors said, to sponsor the magazine by paying a
$3,500 fee for a more adlike depiction of the product. It is either
a bold sales call or a sly social comment. Becker, unsurprisingly,
said it was both _ a Trojan horse with viewing balconies. List/02
has to pay its way, or it's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Are All Lucky,'' a vertical list of Chinese characters left
by the last tenant, was the only sign on List's door.

</P>

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DEREK: Good consumers at an early age _ we had an eye.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why lists?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SERGE: It seemed pure. Very much of the moment. We have less
time right now. They're really easy to kind of glance at. What
about a magazine that condenses everything down to lists? You pick
it up, you check out one or two, you put it down. You pick it up
again. It dispenses with the articles concept.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you come up with the lists?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LISA: Calls, calls, calls.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SERGE: First, we made a list. (Laughter all around.) Blacklist,
wish list, A-list, to-do list. Then wordplays, like socialist,
capitalist. The idea was that it could be a very collaborative
magazine. You can't ask everybody to contribute an article, but you
can ask a lot of people to contribute a list. Lists can be very
boring, but then, a really good list is a really great snapshot
that really captures the moment. A little bit like the cover. (
Becker's 1-year-old daughter, Georgia, is pictured in the arms of
her mother, Jodie Patterson-Becker: the first item on their family
list.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is a magazine of lists with a paying readership a good or a
bad thing?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SERGE: I read The New Yorker. List doesn't replace a really
great researched long-form article. There's not that many great
ones written anyway. There's so much fluff in magazines. This is
cool information that's actually useful.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: How has an architectural office come to publish a magazine?
Is List really a design magazine?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SERGE: I studied communication design in Switzerland. My career
at that point was supposed to be advertising. I hated it. I came
here, got into nightclubs, started designing them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why nightclubs?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SERGE: New York was the city of Studio 54. Clubs were a vital
part of the culture. It's changed. The moment has passed. The
people drawn from the creative world to clubs are focusing on
fields like the Internet. I started designing other places and got
into architecture. Derek and I worked together on the Mercer Hotel.
As you get older, you don't want to be in nightclubs anymore. I had
to create a day job for myself.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Q: Design's such a trendy subject right now, from hotels to Web
sites. Is it is generation's new club scene?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DEREK: There's a glut almost.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SERGE: Design is fashion now. It spreads really fast, because
there's so much media that translate these ideas. From the time
it's a germ until it's some mass product in everybody's house,
everybody's mind, that time lag is so short. These things move like
viruses through the culture.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DEREK: We're talking about something as simple as the radius
curve that you started to see.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SERGE: It started in furniture. Then it went into graphics. One
minute it's in Wallpaper _ the next minute it's at Urban
Outfitters. The next minute . . .
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LISA: Centro-fly.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DEREK: I think our conversations are a little anti-design
sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SERGE: It's not just dealing with the form and the shapes of
things anymore. List is about pure content, and a lot of the design
work that we do is really a little bit like production design,
about scripting _ an environment idea that fits a particular
purpose, then creating a set for it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DEREK: The attempt is to get a little bit of longevity out of
design _ in creating a place that moves you. You go there, to feel
that. It's not a radius curve that you get tired of.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SERGE: We're going through such a transformation of our
information culture _ all these new technologies. They always bring
too much to you. When you first get a cell phone, you're constantly
on the stupid phone. Gradually, you realize, hey _ I can turn this
off. It's the same way with design now: how much design do we
really need? I like the new Jasper Morrison low-pad chair. Do I
need it? Is it exciting? Is it what I want to do with my life?
Absolutely, no.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DEREK: We're still in the infatuation phase with the technology.
You take like Frank Gehry, infatuated with creating shape with it.
It's still new. I think you'll get past that, into something more
content-driven.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's next then?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SERGE: Design becomes less dogmatic, less one style ruling all
and more niche, niche, niche. More people doing their own thing.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do most of us, after 50 years of commercial television,
international advertising strategies and global brands, really have
our own identities to draw upon? Or will individual design just be
an assembly of prefabricated parts? A shoplifter's list?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LISA: It's the theme of our next issue.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SERGE: How we construct personalities as consumers _ all the
consumer choices that people make.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LISA: From clothes to water.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SERGE: The car they drive, the toothpaste they use. We tried to
look at our own lives: what we use, how we make decisions. Do you
ever ask yourself that?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LISA: All the time.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DEREK: All the time! (Laughter all around.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SERGE: When you look at the magazine, you'll think, ``Where are
the ads?'' The magazine is the ad. We won't have a single page of
real advertising, but companies will pay for our endorsement, when
we show their product, in a personality's profile.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: That doesn't seem particularly provocative, or new. Michael
Jordan wears Nikes _ we know that.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SERGE: But Jordan is paid to wear Nikes. The value of our
endorsement is different: it's true. Real people are saying they
really use the product. That's at least as valuable as an ad, to an
advertiser.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it still possible to be in love?

   DEREK: Muhammad Ali and Rem Koolhaas.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SERGE: I have to say Rem. It's the first thing that came to my
mind. He doesn't make value judgments. He deals with a lot of what
we've been talking about. He embraces these changes that are
coming.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: OK, that's one.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

<P>
   LISA: I'm totally blank. I can only think of my mother right
now.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SERGE: I'm trying to think of a person that I find inspiring, in
terms of helping people get past these doubts, all these daunting
changes that are constantly assaulting us, that can inspire you to
say, ``No it's not getting worse, it's getting better,'' and have
trust in that. I met Nelson Mandela, when he got out of jail and
came to New York. He had dinner at TriBeCa Grill. I was totally
blown away by his example, but then, I look at his country. Maybe
it isn't enough, the idea that one person can do it all.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is globalization a good or a bad thing?
</P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SERGE: We're becoming members of, not ethnic tribes, but
cultural tribes, that have their equivalent all around the globe.
When we travel, we travel within that world. You have your
equivalent of the scene that you have here in L.A. When you go to
London, you have your connectors that bring you into the same
world.

arrive at great wisdom by not interacting at all.

</P>
<P>
   Q: What one thing would you change if you could change anything?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DEREK: I'd slow the world down _ just the pace that everything's
progressing at. That's the one thing that's anxiety ridden in me.
If I slowed it down, somehow, inside me, it would calm a lot of
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

BUILDING OUTSIDE THE (GRAY) BOX: A LEGACY OF CURVES AND COLORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BONNIE SCHWARTZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Morris Lapidus, who is 97 and architect of the iconic,
mid-'50s Fontainebleu Hilton and Eden Roc hotels in Miami Beach and
more than 1,000 other projects, was in town recently, he had lunch
with his colleague Philip Johnson as well as his former clients,
the brothers Tisch. Between lunches with friends and meetings with
manufacturers to discuss licensing his product designs, Lapidus sat
briefly in Central Park, recounting for House &AMP; Home some of his
most memorable New York projects and looking back on his life as a
contrarian. Q: What was your most significant New York project? A:
The Summit Hotel on Lexington Avenue [currently the Loews Hotel,
now under renovation and scheduled to reopen as the Metropolitan
Hotel). When it opened in the '60s it was the most hated hotel in
New York. New Yorkers couldn't stand it because I used so much
color. People here like things gray.
</P>
<P>
   It was a beautiful, fresh and bright hotel. One critic said that
you had to put your sunglasses on when you walked in. The exterior
was bright, too, clad with multicolored terra cotta. It was a
beautiful place. Inside, I designed Lucite furniture so it wouldn't
look cluttered, as the lobby was very, very narrow. I used every
trick I knew to make it an exciting place, but New York hated it.
People poked fun at it, but it was a very successful hotel. Q: Your
most unusual project? A: A swimming pool in the Bedford-Stuyvesant
area of Brooklyn. I knew the neighborhood because I went to
Brooklyn Boys' High School. It was actually a whole park _ all
concrete. I built two swimming pools there, a diving pool and a
long, Olympic-size pool, plus a grandstand. The most unusual thing
about it was I created climbing structures for the kids, including
a stepped, pyramid-shaped one that hid the pipes that ventilated
the pool. That was some project. It took years to build. Q: Some of
your largest New York projects? A: I did a very large apartment
complex called Trump Village in Coney Island, with large grounds
and walkways and gardens and a shopping complex. That was for
Donald Trump's father. I also did the Americana Hotel on Seventh
Avenue [now the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers), which has
about 2,000 rooms and is about 600 feet high. That's the largest
single building I have ever done, and though it has been renovated
over the years by other designers, its basic form is still as I
originally designed it.  &QL; 
Q: You have always been an iconoclast in the field of architecture.
What separated you from the pack? A: I study people, not geometry.
I look at how people react to the forms of architecture and have
noticed certain things. People like bright colors. They are drawn
to them. People are also like moths; they are drawn to light.
Without knowing it, people gravitate to the brightest spots in a
room. People like to meander _ we don't walk like soldiers in
straight lines. So I have always created sweeping, curving, organic
interiors, never rectilinear ones. I know that people love
adornment and I give it to them. To me adornment has never been a
dirty word.
</P>
<P>
   I started out as a store designer and I learned everything I
know from that base. When I finally got to do the Fontainebleu, I
was able to incorporate all the things I had learned from my store
work. It was a great success and people loved it. But the
architects thought it was an atrocity; the design was totally
antithetical to the Modernist cube. From that point on, for nearly
30 years, my work was never published. Still, clients loved it. For
many years I had two large offices, one in New York, one in Miami,
and work was always plentiful. Q: What put you and your work back
on the map? A: It was 1990 and I had retired. I had given up trying
to explain what I was doing and had actually thrown away most of my
drawings in a Dumpster. Then a Swiss publisher, Birkhaeuser, called
and said that European architects were clamoring to get their hands
on anything at all I had done. So Birkhaeuser commissioned a book
and I gave the publisher access to all of my photos. In 1992 I was
invited to the Netherlands where an exhibition of these photos had
been mounted. While I was there the first copy of the book arrived
from the publisher. It was called ``Morris Lapidus: The Architect
of the American Dream.'' Suddenly the whole world woke up. Even the
American architects went for it.  &QL; 
Q: Do you feel like your work has substantially influenced the work
of others? A: Absolutely. Now I am seeing buildings done in the
style of my own. Philip Johnson's Lipstick Building is a good
example _ I think even he would admit that I have had an affect on
how he thinks about shapes. Other architects are beginning to round
the corners of their buildings, too. Whether they admit it is
because of my influence or not, I don't know. I do know that now my
work is considered a source that young architects look at and try
to emulate. For me, it's a vindication. Q: What is your prognosis
for the future of architecture? A: The 21st century will once and
for all forget about building huge boxes. Buildings will curve,
they will sweep, they will be colorfully lighted at night and they
will have all sorts of ornament. The human species genetically
reacts to curves. Early men built round huts, not square ones.
Caves curved and swept. &QL; 
Q: Who were your greatest influences? A: Oscar Niemeyer, who curved
all of his buildings. And, of course, Le Corbusier, who did
rectangular buildings, but his greatest building is a sweeping,
curving monastery. And then there is Frank Lloyd Wright, who always
did squares and rectangles, but whose Guggenheim Museum is one huge
spiral. Sooner or later all the great ones lose the boxes and
rectangles.  &QL; 
Q: What have you not had a chance to build that you would like to?
A: I have two projects I have designed that would be a dream to see
built. One is my Helix Building, a round building that is in
constant motion. The other is a hotel that gets larger as it
spirals up. But I don't know that I really want to build anymore. I
will be 98 in November. I'll talk about things and hope to leave an
influence, but no more buildings.

SEX AND THE SITTING ROOM ON TWO CONTINENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MASON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ ``I just hope I don't pick up a fake English accent,''
Candace Bushnell said, reaching for a glass of Champagne proffered
by a dapper butler on hand one evening to serve her and some 25
British and American guests cocktails and blinis laden with caviar.
The setting: Cranley Lodge, the London pied-a-terre of her English
boyfriend, Stephen Morris, where Bushnell now makes herself at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Like the main character in ``Single Process,'' a novella in her
new book, ``Four Blondes'' (Atlantic Monthly Press), Bushnell
appears to have found love at last with a suave gent after years of
exasperation with the dating game in New York. Since the couple
began cavorting romantically 15 months ago, Bushnell has been
sharing his home in London. Morris, a venture capitalist with a
taste for the high life, spends three months a year in England.
</P>
<P>
   ``London's like New York _ there's a lot of funny, fun girls
here,'' Bushnell said. One of them is Imogen Edwards-Jones, a
columnist for The Times of London. With a flourish, Edwards-Jones
entered Cranley Lodge clutching a copy of her own new book, ``My
Canape Hell.'' (``It's about a girl on a downward spiral in
celebrity hell London,'' she said.) The two women embraced with
theatrical effusiveness. For all the withering precision with which
she chronicles the glittering lives of semicelebrities, social
aspirants and moneyed folk, Bushnell, 41, appears to relish being
part of the world she makes seem so harrowing.
</P>
<P>
   Cranley Lodge, despite the grand name, is a tiny two-bedroom
house built in 1860 as a painting studio for an earl's wife.
Essentially a country cottage in Chelsea, in the middle of London,
the house is concealed behind a high brick wall that barely
diminishes the roar of passing double-decker buses.
</P>
<P>
   Morris appeared at the party in a conservative blue suit and tie
that looked incongruous in the silvery stage set designed for him
by Nicholas Haslam, the society decorator. ``I told Nicky I wanted
it to be like a Roman villa, then I pretty much left it to him,''
Morris said. Haslam gave him trompe l'oeil stone walls, plump sofas
and shimmering curtains. ``It's the stuff photographers' umbrellas
are made out of,'' Haslam said. ``It keeps in the heat in winter,
and it's terribly chic.''
</P>
<P>
   During the party _ where the eccentric assortment of guests
included Paul McKenna, a celebrity hypnotist; a bevy of rail-thin
blondes; and raffish bankers chuckling about plans to hit a
lap-dance joint later _ Haslam carried on decorating. With casual
aplomb, he whipped a small tube of gold paint out of his pocket and
proceeded to daub a scuffed fluted column.
</P>
<P>
   Although Haslam sought her opinion, Bushnell had limited input.
She doesn't do decor (even though her parents took her antiquing
almost every Sunday of her childhood, she said) but she makes an
effort to be spectacularly decorative. Bushnell greeted the guests
in a mohair micro-miniskirt with sequins, and glittery knee-high
boots by Jimmy Choo, enthusiastically inhaling Marlboro Lights and
shaking a professionally coiffed golden mane.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly for a chronicler of sexual mores in ``Four Blondes''
and her first book, ``Sex and the City,'' she invariably writes
next to the bed. ``So the only thing I asked for was a little tiny
desk in the bedroom, because that's where I work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After years of struggling as a freelance writer for women's
magazines _ her career began improbably at Ladies' Home Journal and
Good Housekeeping _ she gained recognition five years ago as the
sex columnist for The New York Observer; lucrative book, television
and film contracts followed.
</P>
<P>
   She now flies business class and relishes shopping sprees (but
not in London. ``You find yourself buying a little pair of sweat
pants and it's like $200,'' she said). And she gives imaginative
gifts. For Christmas, she commissioned a painting from Lady Theresa
Chipman _ a painter who is the sister of the Duke of Rutland, as
well as the former lead singer in a rock band. Chipman is also an
ex-New York nightclubbing pal of Bushnell. The subject of the
painting? Morris. The painting is displayed in the Chelsea living
room.
</P>
<P>
   She seems tickled that her travels in the fast lane in New York
and London, including her nighttime peregrinations and even her sex
life, have become the subject of gossip columns on both sides of
the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being an author is really the lowest level of celebrity,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but she has raised it to a high art with a series of
titillating publicity pictures that feature her seemingly infinite
legs and generous portions of honey-toned flesh. Currently, she is
working on a movie script for Universal Studios based on
``Platinum,'' the third novella in ``Four Blondes,'' about an
insecure American girl married to a European prince whose life _
and Cinderella fantasy _ starts to fall apart when she becomes
convinced that her husband is cheating on her.
</P>
<P>
   Bushnell says that Universal executives have been urging her to
make some characters seem more mature, sincere and to have them
exude noble intent. ``I was trying to do it, but I got stuck,''
Bushnell admitted. ``Then I realized, I don't do noble. I do
shallow and superficial.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, she may find material lacking in London, which she
distinguishes from New York as a place where one might actually be
happily married and not have to be constantly in search of
excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not a big deal, being married here,'' Bushnell
marveled. ``It's not this horrifying thing that it is for men in
New York. Here, they don't have the attitude of the old ball and
chain. If you're married, it doesn't mean you're home every night
with your spouse. There's less of that `Oh-my-God-he's out,
what-is-he-doing?' syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   Dinner parties at home in London are the preferred form of
socializing. ``It's not like New York, where you feel like going
out is your second job,'' she said. ``Here, it feels like people go
out not necessarily to have their photograph taken, but to see
their friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that she has given up on New York. Three of the four stories
in her new book are set in Manhattan. She divides her time between
New York, London and a rented house in Kent, Conn. In Manhattan,
she and a girlfriend, Anne Fell, share an Upper East Side apartment
just a few blocks north of the town house Morris, 35, uses when he
is in town. She shares the Connecticut house with Sara Colleton, a
film producer who also lives in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotionally, I think it's healthier to live with other
people,'' Bushnell said. ``If I am working alone in the country, I
feel like I'm going crazy after a few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Morris' business activities frequently take him to
Australia and all over Europe, Bushnell explained, the couple try
to schedule weekends together in Connecticut or flying visits to
London.
</P>
<P>
   ``English guys are fun,'' Bushnell said. ``They're more relaxed
and less afraid of being themselves and being vulnerable. Most of
the English men I know are willing to poke fun at themselves _ it's
less of a macho culture. You don't meet guys here who go to the gym
every day. Men here just don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, she noted: ``In England, character counts for a lot.
You don't have to look like a model to get a guy.'' (Looking like
one herself, she would have to admit that it helps.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about being entertaining and being a good egg,'' she
said. ``Englishmen are entertaining _ they're characters. They can
be flawed and make mistakes and it's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Does she include her new boyfriend in that description? ``I
don't feel that comfortable talking about it much,'' she said. ``He
is terrific. I would say he would fit that model.''
</P>
<P>
   Englishmen are no more likely to discuss their feelings than the
American variety, she observed. ``But unlike New York, this is not
a psychoanalyzed culture,'' she said. ``That idea of English
restraint, which sounds horrifying to Americans, is actually a good
thing, like this culture of manners and being polite. The truth is
that manners and politeness can get you through the rough patches
of a relationship. If you act like nothing happened, sometimes it's
better.''

LONDON: it's better.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bushnell's appreciation for restraint _ at least in men _ seems
to have been instilled when she was growing up in Glastonbury,
Conn. ``I'm from New England,'' she said. ``We're kind of cold.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last three years, she and Colleton have been renting a
small, slightly ramshackle, red-painted clapboard Connecticut house
that sits on nine acres, with a sizable pond. ``Stephen kindly
calls this a cottage,'' she said during a visit in August to her
country place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nonsense,'' Morris countered, grinning. ``It's a shack in the
woods.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly, but its cozy slip-covered sofas and threadbare Yankee
chic are a far cry from the bijou glitz of his designer
beige-and-gray bachelor pad in London. For the Connecticut house,
Bushnell picked the vintage fabric for the living room curtains at
a local antiques store with the risible name R.T. Facts, then just
threw the fabric over the curtain rods. ``Yeah, I say, I'm going to
sew them some day, but I really don't sew,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The books in the living room came with the house, but she has
found places for the antique boxes and lamps her mother has given
her over the years.
</P>
<P>
   On a sunny Sunday afternoon in August, Bushnell wandered around
in a bathing suit and red-and-white striped men's shirt, leading
this reporter on an impromptu tour. ``Henry Kissinger lives up
here, and we share the same plumber,'' she said. ``But that's as
close as I've got to him.''
</P>
<P>
   As she passed through the chaotic kitchen, the casually dressed
Morris gave her a fulsome wink and offered her a beer glass full of
Champagne. ``I always drink Champagne on Saturdays and Sundays,''
Bushnell said, as if imparting the secret of the miracle diet that
keeps her slender and cheerful.
</P>
<P>
   On reaching the abandoned vegetable patch, which has weeds
taller than her 5-foot-6-inch frame, Bushnell issued a confession.
``I'm not much of a gardener and I can't decorate,'' she said,
sounding apologetic. ``I'm so bad at it. I'm just so lucky that
Sara is my roommate, because she's great at all that stuff. I'm the
kind of person who after 15 minutes in a place doesn't notice the
furniture. I don't really notice my environment.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the time she spends in the country, Bushnell seems
quintessentially urban, making no claims to being domesticated.
Asked why he fell for Bushnell, Morris laughed. ``It's not her
chicken wings, I'll tell you that,'' he said.

MURDER ACCUSATIONS SHROUD INDUSTRY STANDARD'S LATIN AMERICA TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAN FOST  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Here's a story you won't read in the Industry
Standard.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tale of how the hot Internet magazine nearly nailed a
deal to acquire or enter a partnership with a new Latin American
monthly.
</P>
<P>
   And it's also a tale of how talks with the new magazine faltered
_ just as the Standard received a background check that tied one of
the new publication's execs to an old murder accusation in
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation was probably spurious, and Standard CEO John
Battelle says it had nothing to do with the deal getting killed.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Standard weighing a potential public stock
offering, a well-placed source at the Standard asserts, ``We feel
at this stage of our life cycle, we need to be whiter than white.
We concluded we would step away from it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Standard premiered in San Francisco in 1998 and quickly
became a must-read for workers in the burgeoning Internet economy.
While it has dipped its toes into Europe and Asia, it has not
established a presence in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, earlier this year, a team of young journalists had
started Punto-com _ the name is Spanish for dot-com _ as a
magazine, Web site and conference business. In the words of a
Punto-com publicist's pitch, ``think of the Industry Standard and
Red Herring ... focused on the Internet economy in Latin America.''
</P>
<P>
   Although executives from the Standard spent months talking to
Punto-com leaders to try to hammer out some sort of joint venture,
with the courtship extending to meetings in Florida and Spain,
numerous factors conspired to squash the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies disagreed over issues such as what to call the
new venture and whether it would be an acquisition or a
partnership. Battelle also said the Standard's board of directors
balked because Punto-com was launched as a ``pan-regional play,''
covering several countries simultaneously, while the Standard
prefers to move into one country at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Standard's board of directors apparently didn't
even know about the explosive background check when they informally
gave the deal a thumbs-down. Two directors, speaking confidentially
and through a spokesperson, expressed surprise at the report; two
others did not return repeated phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Standard executives didn't necessarily believe the murder
accusation when they did find out, the source said. ``Maybe we were
being too conservative,'' the source said. ``No one at Punto-com
was ever charged with any crime. ... Friends of people at Punto-com
were involved in this incident, and that was enough for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The background check, described by Standard executives as part
of their routine ``due diligence,'' unexpectedly turned up
8-year-old allegations that tied Punto-com's founder and chairman,
Isaac Lee, to a shooting death at a Bogota apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mataron a un hombre bueno,'' screamed the headline in the
now-defunct tabloid La Prensa on Aug. 23, 1992. Translation: They
killed a good man.
</P>
<P>
   The article told of a doorman who was killed by police four
months earlier. It alleged that Lee was working in security for a
Cabinet minister at the time and was helping someone in the
building stockpile weapons. The article included assertions that
Lee was part of an Israeli conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who was 20 at the time, vehemently denies any involvement
in the killing of the doorman.
</P>
<P>
   He was not at the building at the time of the incident, and
neither Lee nor his friends or colleagues were ever charged with
any crimes. Lee said the article was an attempt to smear the
Cabinet minister he was working for.
</P>
<P>
   Lee contends that the doorman was drunk and shooting at the
police at the time, and that investigations exonerated even the
police officers who pulled the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Lee and others in the Colombian press maintain that the
journalist who wrote the story accusing Lee has a controversial and
checkered history in Colombia. A Chronicle correspondent
interviewed the journalist, who stands by his story.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the assertions on either side of the story are difficult
to substantiate. It's probably impossible to thoroughly prove or
disprove allegations of an 8-year-old murder in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee did not have a chance to present his case to the
Standard. Executives there never told him what their investigators
turned up until I started making inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Lee gave me a long list of people who could speak to his
integrity.
</P>
<P>
   People like Miguel Silva, the CEO of Publicaciones Semana when
Lee _ as editor in chief of Semana magazine, Colombia's leading
newsweekly _ was one of his employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The editor in chief of Semana has an armored car, he has
bodyguards, he has a driver, and he usually takes very good care in
how or where he moves. It's a very risky job,'' Silva said. ``Every
journalist in Colombia has a risky job. This is a tough place to
write tough stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee never shied from publishing hard-hitting controversial
material, whether about narco-traffickers, leftist guerrillas,
right-wing paramilitaries or the government.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was ``one of most aggressive and leading investigative
journalists,'' said Doug Farah, a reporter for the Washington Post,
who covered Colombia for 10 years and is now based in Africa. ``He
wasn't an investigative journalist himself, but he headed
publications that turned folks loose to do investigations on
drug-trafficking paramilitaries and other things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People I really trusted, really trusted Isaac,'' Farah said.
``That was why I worked with him. People who I knew and who could
have had me killed easily and didn't, trusted him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee rose to prominence at a very young age. He was only 26 when
he was named editor of Semana; he's only 29, at the helm of
Punto-com, a company that's raised $4 million from investors such
as Citicorp Venture Capital and Bank of America. He's got 45
employees already, is trying to raise more than $10 million more
and played host to a glittering launch party last month featuring
author Tom Wolfe and Economist editor Bill Emmot.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's ascendance is ``a fascinating story in Colombian
journalism,'' Silva said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's father was 3 when his family spirited him out of Poland
during the Holocaust. They landed in Colombia, which has only a
small Jewish community, and the family thrived.
</P>
<P>
   His father grew up to run a successful construction supply
business, selling pipes and flooring to the builders of Bogota. Lee
grew up in affluence, but to his father's disappointment, he did
not want to go into his family's business.
</P>
<P>
   He went to work for a Cabinet minister at age 20, handling
everything from errands to political duties to security work.
</P>
<P>
   After the fateful article appeared, however, Lee decided to
become a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, the best revenge is success,'' he said. ``The way
to show people they were doing things wrong is to do them right. I
discovered how powerful the media was, and I wanted to do it
right.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Lee believed that he had put the allegations
behind him after rising to prominence in Colombian journalism
circles.
</P>
<P>
   But then he became an Internet entrepreneur. And the old rumor
surfaced just as his new venture began to take off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel really bad that instead of talking about Punto-com _
the effort we have done, the team we have put together _ instead
I'm having to answer a false rumor that was way, way behind me,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a journalist, you and I know, to dismiss a false rumor is
the hardest thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee said the rumor's resurrection is only stiffening his resolve
to move forward. Punto-com is trying to raise more money this month
and is also seeking partnerships with other U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who is behind this, but it did not work in the
past, and it will not work this time,'' Lee vowed. ``Punto-com will
be a success.''

SON'S MAC AND DAD'S PC CAN BE ONE HAPPY FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   By HENRY NORR  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I want to network my blue-and-white Power Mac G3 to my dad's
PC, but I don't have any idea what to do. We would also like to
share DSL. How can I do this? Is there a book or a Web site out
there that could help me?
</P>
<P>
   A: MacWindows, a site dedicated to peaceful coexistence between
its two namesakes, has an online tutorial on cross-platform
networking (www.macwindows.com/netbasic.html), but it's probably
more complicated than you need, so I'll offer my own advice.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has three levels: getting the two computers
physically connected, enabling them to share files and other
resources, and giving them both access to your DSL line.
Conceptually, each level requires its own solution, though some
products include solutions for several parts of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   -- Making the connection. The first challenge is the easiest. If
your family won't object to having a cable between the two
machines, wired Ethernet is the cheapest solution. It's built into
your Mac, and if your dad's PC is already connected to a DSL line,
it probably already has a network adapter (sometimes known as a
NIC, for network interface card) installed in one of its PCI or ISA
slots. If you don't have DSL yet, the installer who comes to hook
it up will almost certainly offer you a network card as part of the
setup process.
</P>
<P>
   Then just get an ordinary Ethernet hub (they start at around
$30), and connect the Mac, the PC and your DSL device to it with
standard twisted-pair Ethernet cabling, which you should be able to
find at any computer or electronics store. Make sure to get
Category 5 cables, but these days most network cables fit that
description.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want new wires running around your home and both
machines are near phone jacks, Farallon Communications offers
HomeLINE kits that connect Macs and PCs through existing home phone
wiring (www.farallon.com/products/homeline/index.html). Yes, you
can use the phone for voice calls while you're online. A kit with a
single PCI card lists for $65, while an external USB adapter is
$98, and you can get two-packs at a discount.
</P>
<P>
   -- Sharing files. Either HomeLINE or Ethernet solves the first
part of the problem. Sharing files is a bit more complicated. You
can give your dad access to HTML pages on your Mac just by turning
on the Mac OS's built-in Web Sharing feature, via the control panel
of the same name, and selecting a folder to share.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, you want to give him more-complete access to your
Mac, and you want the same on his PC, you will need to buy some
third-party software. Traditionally, the main choices have been
Miramar Systems' $199 PC MacLAN
(www.miramarsys.com/products/pcm.htm) and Thursby Software Systems'
$149 Dave (www.thursby.com/products/dave.htm).
</P>
<P>
   I have Dave installed at home, but I used to use PC MacLAN, and
both have worked well for me. (The former, installed on a PC, adds
support for AppleTalk networking to Windows; the latter, installed
on the Mac side, in effect adds Windows networking technology to
the Mac.) With either one, your dad's PC will show up in your
Chooser, and your Mac in his Network Neighborhood, and you will
have access to each other's drives and, with some limitations,
printers.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is that both products are a bit complicated to
configure and a little pricey for many home users. Fortunately, the
folks at Thursby Software have recognized that, and they are in the
final stages of testing a cross-platform networking product that
makes progress on both fronts. It's called MacSOHO, and it is
scheduled to ship by the end of this month at $99, which means some
outlets are likely to discount it to around $80.
</P>
<P>
   Based on my experience with a beta version, it is hard to
imagine anything simpler _ you don't have to worry about the
technicalities of Internet configuration at all. Just run the
installer on your Mac, answer a few quick questions in an Assistant
application and you're sharing files.
</P>
<P>
   -- Sharing Internet access. That leaves the third level, sharing
access to your DSL line and thus the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest solution to that problem is to get separate, static
IP addresses for each machine from your Internet service provider;
that way, you don't have to install any additional software on
either the Mac or the PC. The downside is that most ISPs charge
extra for additional IP numbers; some offer them only with their
business-oriented service plans, which usually cost a lot more than
consumer plans. With Pac Bell DSL, for example, you would have to
pay $40 more a month to get five IP addresses, even though you
actually need only a couple.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative is hardware or software that lets multiple
machines share a single Internet account; both kinds of products
typically also include a firewall, to protect your mininetwork
against intrusion, and other features.
</P>
<P>
   The software route is a little less expensive, but it has a
definite downside _ the machine hosting the sharing software has to
be running or else the other computer can't get online. My advice
is to use hardware instead, in the form of a product generally
known as an Internet access router.
</P>
<P>
   These devices cost hundreds of dollars when I bought mine, one
called the SonicWall from Sonic Systems (www.sonicsys.com), several
years ago. But prices have dropped sharply _ some first-rate
models, such as the LinkSys EtherFast Cable/DSL Router I recently
tried out (www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?prid20&AMP;grid5), cost
as little as $150, if you shop carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of these devices are listed and evaluated by Mac users
who have tried them (www.macintouch.com/accessrouters.html).
Specific features vary, of course, but nearly all of them include
two technologies, known as NAT (network address translation) and
DHCP (dynamic host configuration protocol), that make it easy for
multiple computers to share a single Internet account.
</P>
<P>
   Their firewall features also provide a strong protection from
hacker attacks _ an important consideration for anyone with DSL or
a cable modem. The devices themselves are typically small (not much
bigger than a modem), silent and fairly easy to set up _ there's
inevitably a bit of configuration involved, so you will need to
look at the instructions, but you don't need to be a networking
expert. In most cases, you can do it all with a Web browser running
on either the Mac or the PC.
</P>
<P>
   And once you have one of these devices set up, it should just
run indefinitely with no further intervention required.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of MACQA907 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  If you can't afford a hardware router, there are several
relatively inexpensive software-only solutions. In fact, if your
dad's PC has Windows 98 Second Edition, a built-in feature called
Internet Access Sharing will do the trick. Microsoft even provides
instructions for getting a Mac online through a PC with this
feature set up _ see
support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q230/5/85.ASP?LNEN-US&AMP;SD
gn&AMP;FR0. Windows Millennium Edition, the consumer version Microsoft
</P>
<P>
   plans to release next week, has a similar feature.
</P>
<P>
   If your dad doesn't have Windows 98 Second Edition or ME there's
a slew of low-cost PC-sharing utilities with names like WinGate and
WinProxy. As far as I know, they all support Mac clients.
</P>
<P>
   If you would prefer to run the access-sharing software on your
Mac, the two main contenders are Sustainable Software's IPNetRouter
(www.sustworks.com/site/prodiprouteroverview.html) and Vicomsoft's
SurfDoubler (www.vicomsoft.com/surfdoubler/surf.main.html).
IPNetRouter, which is priced at $89 or $44.50 for students and
academic organization, is more powerful and versatile; SurfDoubler
is more limited but priced at only $29 for two machines. (It's
included in Farallon's HomeLINE kits).
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WARNING OF THE MONTH &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mac OS 9's Multiple Users feature can be a real convenience in
households and offices where several people share the same Mac. It
enables users, administrators or parents to create up to 40
customized desktop environments _ just log in and you get your own
settings, preferences and favorites. The feature also makes it
possible to limit each user's access to applications and to other
users' documents.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are serious about keeping any or all of your files
away from children, co-workers or anyone else, don't count on
Multiple Users' access controls to do the job, because any slightly
savvy 12-year-old can figure out how to bypass them.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Apple recently posted step-by-step instruction on how
to do so in its online Tech Info Library. The note was listed as
``RESTRICTED: Apple Internal and Support Providers Only _ Not for
General Public Release,'' but for at least several days it was
easily accessible to anyone with a browser, and its availability
was noted on several Mac Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; TIP OF THE MONTH
</P>
<P>
   Tired of wrestling with the hockey-puck mouse that came with
your iMac or USB-equipped Power Mac? There are numerous third-party
alternatives available, not to mention clip-on shells that give the
awful Apple mouse a more-manageable shape.
</P>
<P>
   But you won't find a better mouse than the Apple Pro Mouse, the
sleek, buttonless (or all-button) optical design the company
introduced in July. It's now available, at least from Apple's
online store, as an upgrade for any USB Mac. At $59 it's not
exactly cheap, but it may make your time on the Mac a lot more
pleasant and productive.
</P>
<P>
   While you're at it, you may want to consider ordering Apple's
new Pro Keyboard, which also costs $59. It's a huge improvement
over Apple's previous model, offering full-size navigation and
function keys and a nice solid feel, yet retaining a relatively
compact size.
</P>
<P>
   Just a couple of warnings: In addition to USB, it requires Mac
OS 9.0.4, and four of its keys _ new ones for volume up, volume
down, mute and media eject _ work only with the latest Macs. Apple
says they won't be functional on older models until a software
upgrade scheduled for early 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, Microsoft also makes USB keyboards, and though
they are marketed mainly for Windows PCs, the company now
officially supports two of them _ the Microsoft Natural Keyboard
Pro and Internet Keyboard Pro _ on the Mac. Not surprisingly, they
are not as spiffy as Apple's, but I have found them comfortable and
convenient. You might not find Mac software in the box, or at least
not the latest version, but Microsoft just posted a new release at
www.microsoft.com/products/hardware/keyboard/download/mac/macdownl
oad.htm.  &QL; Mac Q&AMP;A runs the first Thursday of each month. Send
questions to Henry Norr at  &LR; mac &LR; sfchronicle.com.  &LR; Please specify
what Mac model and what version of the Mac OS you're using.

SALINGER PROVES ELUSIVE, EVEN TO HIS DAUGHTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID KIPEN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (set ital)Why are all our heroes so imperfect? ...
</P>
<P>
   William Faulkner, drunk and depressed.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Parker, mean, drunk and depressed.
</P>
<P>
   And that guy, ``Seven Years in Tibet''? Turned out to be a
Nazi.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   _ Jill Sobule, ``Heroes'' &QR;
</P>
<P>
   For those of us to whom J.D. Salinger was ever a hero, his
daughter's book adds another unwelcome verse to Jill Sobule's great
new pop song. That guy, ``The Catcher in the Rye''? Turned out to
be a misogynist, a crackpot and such a perfectionist that he'll
occasionally drink the same beverage twice.
</P>
<P>
   This we needed to know? Margaret A. ``Peggy'' Salinger seems to
think so. ``Dream Catcher'' tells the story of her life as
firstborn daughter to postwar America's most widely read author of
ambitious fiction _ a man who retreated to a mountain home in New
Hampshire in the '50s and whose sole available output since 1965
consists of legal filings to protect his privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dream Catcher'' is really two books in one: a very short, at
times acute critical biography of Peggy's father and an overlong,
provisionally uplifting account of her own life, culminating in
marriage, the birth of her now kindergarten-age son and
long-awaited professional satisfaction as a hospital chaplain.
Curious readers naturally will wish the dimensions of these two
books could be reversed, but that was out of the author's control.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Salinger, as presented here, comes to seem almost as
reclusive to his daughter as he's been to his admirers. From well
before Peggy's birth in the mid-'50s until well past his withdrawal
from publishing, Salinger has apparently put in terribly long hours
at his work _ which he never discussed, at least with his family.
Peggy's parents divorced when she was in her teens and, although
geographically still close, she saw even less of him than before.
When a few years ago her father suggested that she abort her child
in the sixth month of an arduous pregnancy, communication dried up
completely.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly ideal conditions for a tell-all. Presumably for legal
reasons, Peggy can't even quote from Salinger's letters (some to
Hemingway) that she finds at the Library of Congress. Although her
writing has flashes of insightful wit and wordplay, it falls to
Salinger's invalid sister to deliver the most durable summation of
``Sonny's'' character:
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't take any criticism. I'm just sorry I'll be dead and
won't see that book he's been working on all these years. Not
publishing all these years. What a crazy business. It's because he
can't stand any criticism. He sure doles it out, though. I love
him, my brother and I were the best of friends growing up, you
know, but I have to admit that he's a bastard.''
</P>
<P>
   What made Salinger, now in his 80s, such a bastard to every
family member cited except his son and, one hopes, his third wife,
with whom he still lives up that same mountain road? Peggy doesn't
know or pretend to, though she brings to bear (perhaps too much)
research on anti-Semitism in prewar America, coupled with some
fairly astute readings of the still largely uncollected short
stories that grew out of Salinger's traumatic experiences in World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Bastard or no, tidings of another book from Salinger will get
pulses racing among his ever-growing legion of fans, to say nothing
of booksellers everywhere. This is as it should be, even if his
last published novella, ``Hapworth 16, 1924,'' portended an
increasingly fanatical preoccupation with his fictional Glass
family and can't hold a candle to either ``The Catcher in the Rye''
or the underestimated ``Franny and Zooey.'' (``Hapworth'' came out
in a 1965 issue of the New Yorker and has never seen print in book
form, though tiny Orchises Press _ not for the first time _ claims
that an edition is forthcoming, this time in November.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Dream Catcher'' fans our hopes further with word that Salinger
has left instructions for the posthumous publication of at least
some post-1965 work.
</P>
<P>
   The question won't go away _ why (set ital)are(end ital) all our
heroes so imperfect? Bitter as she gets, Peggy knows the answer:
because they're human. To her credit, she remembers good times,
too, the wonderful bedtime stories from a great and _ why do so
many people forget this about Salinger? _ often very funny
storyteller.
</P>
<P>
   And why did Peggy write ``Dream Catcher''? She claims she wrote
it to answer her son's eventual questions about where his family
came from, but that doesn't explain why she felt compelled to
publish it while her father is still alive. It wouldn't have
compromised the book's meager but undeniable worth _ as a piece of
mildly informative insider literary criticism, or as a
better-written-than-most recovery memoir _ to admit that her son's
college fund may benefit along with his emotional well-being.
</P>
<P>
   How people feel about ``Dream Catcher'' may ultimately depend on
how they feel about biographical criticism in general. Is the
writing really all that matters? Or can correlations between a
writer and his work sometimes help us understand how, writers or
not, who we are becomes what we do? Those of us who believe the
latter can finish ``Dream Catcher'' without needing a shower _
though at times, while reading all the interminable notes Peggy's
classmates passed her in junior high, a nap may prove tempting.

SEGA HOPES THE NET CAN KEEP IT FROM FALLING 
</HEADLINE>
   By KELLY ZITO  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If Sega were a character in one of its own video
games, it would be swinging across a bottomless crevasse clinging
to a thin rope.
</P>
<P>
   The rope in this case is the 16-foot telephone cable that comes
with the company's flagship Dreamcast console. The crevasse is the
uncertain future the company faces as it tries to outmaneuver a
horde of formidable competitors with an online service that
launches today.
</P>
<P>
   Sega, the once-dominant maker of the video-game consoles that
hook into television sets, is hoping to jump start sales of the
Dreamcast and take the lead in the fledgling online gaming industry
with the premiere of SegaNet.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of Internet service provider and online gaming
hub, SegaNet is the first time a consolemaker has allowed users to
face off against fellow gamers from across the country _ rather
than across the living room. While gamers have been able to play
over the Web using personal computers for years, no game console
has capitalized on the phenomenon, though most in the industry say
online games are key to the industry's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet can change this business as it has banking and
retailing, but so far it hasn't,'' said Peter Moore, president of
San Francisco's Sega of America. ``This is a watershed moment in
the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Using Dreamcast's built-in modem and the phone cable, users can
log on to SegaNet for 50 free hours of football, mainly, since NFL
2K1 is one of the two online games available now (Sega says about
30 Web-ready titles will premiere in the next several months). If
consumers sign up for the $22-a-month ISP for 18 months, they
receive a free Dreamcast (now at $150, down from $200) and keyboard
for typing smack with their buddies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a great opportunity here to set the standard for
online gaming,'' said Gartner Group senior analyst P.J. McNealy.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there is one major snafu already, he says _
AOL's proprietary technology prevents the company's 23 million
subscribers from logging onto SegaNet directly. However, Sega says
consumers can call a toll-free number and service representatives
will give them a special number to bypass AOL and tap directly into
SegaNet _ also for free. Sega said it is working with AOL to
rectify the situation.
</P>
<P>
   However, a glitch of that magnitude doesn't bode well for the
troubled Sega. In the past several months, Dreamcast sales have
cooled. In addition, independent video gamemakers seem to be
focusing more on on Sony's PlayStation 2 _ the highly anticipated
follow-up to the ubiquitous PlayStation _ as well as new machines
from Microsoft and Nintendo.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Sega is trying to dig itself out of a deep hole it
dug for itself in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Early that year, the company was enjoying a 50 percent market
share in the video-game console market and had a 1,400 head count
at its American headquarters in San Francisco. Then it launched
Saturn. Difficult to develop games for and backed by a weak
marketing campaign, Saturn was a major flop. Sega's market share
plummeted to less than 1 percent and the company reduced its
workforce in San Francisco to about 100. Sony entered the market
later that year with PlayStation, snatched market share from Sega
and Nintendo and hasn't looked back.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say Sega's Dreamcast rebate and free SegaNet
access smack of desperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they go this aggressive and give away a lot of consoles and
SegaNet and people don't buy the software, then they've failed _
and that could represent a terminal failure for Sega,'' said Andy
Eddy, editor at GameWeek magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But Sega says it is simply trying to draw a starker contrast
between Dreamcast and the competition. Dreamcast supports dial-up _
or narrowband _ Internet access, while Sony and Microsoft will
support only broadband connections. What's more, at $150, Dreamcast
costs half as much as PlayStation 2, which is due out Oct. 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story of our demise is a little premature,'' Sega's Moore
told the crowd at a recent game industry conference in Napa.
</P>
<P>
   PlayStation ``will be wildly successful, but unless they back it
up with software, the shine wears off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend that Sony has an unimpressive lineup of games
for PlayStation 2's premiere; and Sony officials conceded recently
that ``some of the launch titles in Japan didn't reinvent the
wheel.'' In addition, there are no online games ready for release
when PlayStation 2 goes on sale.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sony is arguably one of the best-known brands when it
comes to home electronics gadgets. And, the PlayStation 2 has a DVD
player _ considered a major selling point for consumers on the
fence _ and the support of all of the biggest video-game publishers
in the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really Sony's game to lose,'' said David Herschman,
executive vice president for sales and marketing at Flipside.com,
an online gaming division of software giant Havas Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   If Sega sells 5 million Dreamcasts in the United States by the
spring (2.1 million units have been sold since Dreamcast's Sept. 9,
1999, launch), the company says it can rest assured that game
publishers will continue to pump out titles for the console. Sega
says its strength has always been its innovative titles, like
Seaman, the virtual pet man-fish that slings snappy comebacks at
players through voice recognition software.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Sega hopes to use certain titles, such as NFL 2K1,
to establish online leagues and formal competitions where Gap or
Nike pay sponsor fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes a network like ABC, NBC or CBS,'' Moore said.
``It's not that different from people playing fantasy football, but
they get to be the players.''
</P>
<P>
   If Sega falls short of that ``critical mass'' figure, the
assumption is that developers may shift resources to other
platforms. But Sega officials in San Francisco say the firm will
remain financially solvent, largely because CSK Corp., the Japanese
information services company that owns 20 percent of Sega, has
recently invested $1 billion in the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Others aren't so sure Sega will weather this storm _ even though
the online component could give the console and company a nice bump
in revenues. The resurrection of the ``Sega Scream'' ad campaign
could help, and Dreamcasts will make several appearances tonight
during the MTV Video Music Awards.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how much marketing muscle Sega throws behind
Dreamcast, the console market is strictly a three-horse race,
according to many industry insiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you count Xbox, Sony, Nintendo and Sega, that's four,''
said Jay Cohen, director of Ubi Soft, a San Francisco game
publisher. ``Someone's going to take a hit. I don't know who it's
going to be, but it will be interesting to see in a year.''

PLANETOUT EXPANDS UNIVERSE WITH DEAL FOR MAGAZINES 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAN FOST  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;   &LR; It's getting to be a familiar story in the
business world: the Internet upstart buying its offline
predecessors. Think EBay buying Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield or AOL
purchasing Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Now that it's happening in the market serving gays and lesbians,
it's causing some debate about the pros and cons of media
consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, the San Francisco Web firm PlanetOut's pending
acquisition of the company that publishes the Advocate and Out
magazines has sparked criticism. The fear is that PlanetOut may be
able to exercise too much control over what a noisy and diverse
community has to say.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, even PlanetOut's rivals say they're
encouraged by the deal for what it symbolizes: the continued growth
of gay-oriented businesses into a force to be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the maturing of a marketplace where gay and lesbian
business _ five, 10 and 15 years ago _ was very much in the
closet,'' said Lowell Selvin, chief executive of Gay.com. ``Today,
those businesses have stepped out of the closet. They're looking at
ways to grow, not just as community organizations but as true
businesses: acquire capital, expand reach, consolidate. It's part
of a natural progression.''
</P>
<P>
   For PlanetOut, the progression marks a phenomenal growth. The
company started out as the pioneering Digital Queers Web site,
which promoted an online gay community. Then it foundered amid
internal turmoil as an investment bank pulled its funding in a
dispute over serving the transgender community. Today, it has
emerged as a leading venture-backed player on the national gay
media scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal from day one has been to become the leading provider
of information, goods, services, media and entertainment,'' said
Megan Smith, PlanetOut's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, it's no surprise that a gay-oriented dot-com would
swallow up its old media predecessors. Smith said 70 percent of
subscribers to the Advocate and Out magazines get it them plain
wrappers, choosing not to be identified as gay. ``That will always
physically stop and limit distribution,'' said Susan Schuman,
PlanetOut's chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, such barriers don't exist, as people can surf
the Web freely in the privacy of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite exciting that somebody in the Deep South could find
through Google.com stuff about gay people and become connected,''
said comedian and writer Kate Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Web privacy is also no guarantee: Many companies can
tell an awful lot about the people who visit their Web site.
</P>
<P>
   That's the downside of what Clinton describes as a switch from a
movement to market.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sentiment many echo as they mull the combination of
PlanetOut and Liberation Publications, the parent of the Advocate
and Out. (The $30 million merger was announced in March, but has
not yet closed. PlanetOut says that the deal was announced early in
the process and that negotiations are proceeding without any
apparent trouble.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Consolidation in the gay media world will prove a much
stronger business model for PlanetOut,'' said Steven Petrow, a
former editor at Time Interactive who will moderate a panel
discussion on media convergence at the National Lesbian and Gay
Journalists Association convention, which begins today in San
Francisco. ``Without a diversified `empire,' it's very difficult
for a company like PlanetOut to reach profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, consolidation has its downside as well,''
added Petrow, now a Web consultant. ``For writers, especially in
the gay press, it means there are fewer entities to work for, and
the larger an entity becomes, the greater its leverage is against
its writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's also anxiety in the gay community that this
consolidation will mean less diversity of points of view in the gay
press overall as PlanetOut continues on its shopping spree.''
</P>
<P>
   The concerns stem partly from the speed of the consolidation: In
February, the Advocate said it was buying Out, and then the
PlanetOut deal was announced only one month later.
</P>
<P>
   PlanetOut and the magazines insist they will not stifle
different viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start to have it all become one point of view or one
voice, it's not going to work,'' said Judy Wieder, editor in chief
of the Advocate. ``People are going to be bored with it. You need
variety. You need many different people.''
</P>
<P>
   PlanetOut executives say that even with the clout of
consolidation, the newly merged company would be a far cry from a
media monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ``A monopoly comes when you have access to the entire market,
and have 90 percent of that market,'' said Schuman, PlanetOut's
chief operating officer. Smith, the CEO, points out that PlanetOut
reaches 1.5 million people per month, out of an estimated 16
million to 20 million gay and lesbian Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Out is the largest gay magazine, with a monthly circulation of
about 100,000. The Advocate is the second largest, with a
twice-monthly circulation of 93,000.
</P>
<P>
   Smith talks in ambitious terms. She notes that gays and lesbians
spend $450 billion a year, which has helped PlanetOut earn
sponsorships and ads from companies such as IBM, Procter &AMP; Gamble
and Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   PlanetOut raised $3 million in 1996 and another $16.4 million
last year, and now has 80 employees in its new Harrison Street
headquarters. Smith says the company continues to view an initial
public offering as an option, which would be a historic first for a
gay-oriented company.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of growth and ambition fills some in the gay media
with a vicarious pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started, it was a fledgling business sector,'' said
Heather Findlay, editor in chief of Girlfriends magazine, published
in San Francisco. ``Now it's starting to behave as if it's not
marginal any more ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly there's an enormous amount of money in a gay media
company. I hope they take some that money and use it to expand the
quality of journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Findlay is particularly concerned that lesbian issues are often
overshadowed by gay men's issues. ``Lesbians had the back seat of
the bus when it came to attention to our issues,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Schuman said PlanetOut is sensitive to those concerns, and
40 percent of PlanetOut's users are women.
</P>
<P>
   Other issues with PlanetOut have been more contentious.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ian Cummings, a former Advocate reporter who is now
publisher of XY, a national magazine for young gay men, was
embroiled in a dispute with PlanetOut earlier this summer over
censorship. PlanetOut had a deal to post XY's content, but yanked a
controversial story in which Cummings charged that big clothing
advertisers boycott XY for anti-gay reasons. Cummings said he was
told the story was pulled because it was ``potentially libelous ...
not appropriate ... (and of) questionable writing quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Cummings wouldn't talk about the incident. PlanetOut and XY have
reached an agreement in which XY has regained the rights to publish
its own content on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But Cummings did say he was worried by consolidation of the gay
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole function of the gay press was, one, to accomplish
social and cultural and political change and, two, to enable people
to meet and have sex and form relationships,'' he said. ``That was
the whole purpose. Now it's changed to deliver market share to
corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuman, at PlanetOut, said that PlanetOut does cover political
and social aspects of the gay community but that it also emphasizes
opening up economic issues. She also would not talk about the
specific incident with XY.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the growth of the Advocate tells the gay media story
in a nutshell.
</P>
<P>
   Wieder, the Advocate's editor, said the magazine was founded as
a mimeographed sheet in Los Angeles in 1967, two years before the
infamous Stonewall incident, which is seen as the birth of the
gay-rights movement. It has grown more polished and professional
today, with 31 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of years ago, we couldn't have sent a journalist to
cover a terrible murder in West Virginia,'' as she did last month,
she said. ``We didn't have the money to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the Advocate to be as newsy looking as Time magazine.
Time has a lot of little photos, and they cost a lot of money.''

38 CHARGED IN CONTROL OF BUILDING PROJECTS BY MOB AND UNIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Manhattan district attorney charged 38 union
officials, contractors and reputed mobsters Wednesday with bribery,
bid-rigging or other racketeering schemes that he said siphoned
millions of dollars from public and private building projects in
the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   It is the most significant case focusing on organized crime's
role in the construction industry in a decade, the authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those named in a 57-count indictment unsealed Wednesday
were the acting boss of the Lucchese crime family, Steven L. Crea,
53, who prosecutors say has played a role in construction
racketeering schemes for decades, and two of his senior aides,
identified as Lucchese captains. All were charged with enterprise
corruption, restraint of trade and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also charged 11 union officials, including
Michael Forde, who heads both the District Council of Carpenters in
New York City and the carpenters' union Local 608, organizations
long tainted by mob influence. Forde's father headed the local and
was convicted of taking bribes in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, said the
racketeering systematically siphoned millions of dollars from
construction projects throughout the city and diverted it to the
Lucchese family and its partners, corrupt union officials and
contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite law enforcement successes over the years, today's
indictment demonstrates that the fight against organized crime is
far from over,'' Morgenthau said. ``The mob's influence in
construction industry, although not as pervasive as it once was,
still exacts a tremendous cost from the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau said the victims included union trade workers
deprived of jobs by their union leaders; nonunion workers who
replaced them and were paid far below union wage and received no
benefits; and honest contractors frozen out of the bidding by the
mob's corrupt alliance, which allowed their chosen companies to
underbid other firms.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Lucchese family insinuated itself into the
construction of three schools and several road and bridge repair
projects, taxpayers fell victim to the schemes as well, which
levied a 5 percent ``mob tax'' on construction jobs around the
city.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One prosecutor said that the money stolen from the $32 million
that went to build modular classrooms in two schools in Queens and
one in the Bronx could have paid for more classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment, the result of a three-year investigation by
detectives from the Police Department's Organized Crime
Investigative Division and Morgenthau's office, was announced at a
news conference with Morgenthau and Police Commissioner Bernard B.
Kerik.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation used court-ordered wiretaps on 38 telephones
and 24 pagers, and police detectives and the district attorney's
investigators executed 46 search warrants, poring over thousands of
documents detailing the finances of the companies and local unions.
</P>
<P>
   It focused on two Lucchese crews and their representatives on a
special crime family panel devoted to dividing the spoils of the
construction industry. Morgenthau called the panel the Lucchese
Construction Group, and Wednesday, his aides declared it dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lucchese Construction Group no longer exists,'' said
Daniel J. Castleman, the chief of Morgenthau's Investigation
Division, who oversaw the case. ``To the extent that they no longer
exist, it has put a pretty big dent in organized crime's ability to
control these types of job sites.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Crea and two men named as his captains, Dominick
Truscello, 66, and Joseph Tangorra, 51, five named as Lucchese
soldiers, including Joseph Datello, 49, and three as associates
were also charged.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials accused included Santo Lanzafame, 68, the
president of Local 1 of the Builders and Allied Craftsmen, which
represents New York area bricklayers; and three business agents and
three shop stewards from the union. It also named officials from
Laborers International Union Local 20, which represents cement and
concrete workers.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also charges 11 companies and 16 people who owned
or worked for them, including Lawrence Wecker, who prosecutors
identified as a longtime Lucchese family associate and construction
industry racketeer.
</P>
<P>
   Wecker, who was an unindicted co-conspirator in a 1986 case that
struck at the mob's role in the concrete industry, was called ``a
walking ATM machine'' by one mob boss for his money-laundering
prowess. Wecker, who was convicted of federal tax evasion in 1997
in connection with one of the companies named in Wednesday's
indictment, is one of three defendants in the current case who have
not yet been arrested. He is on parole and prosecutors said they
thought he had fled to Malta, in the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Also charged in the case was Joseph Martinelli and his company,
North Berry Corp., which did work on the Trump South development on
the Upper West Side and on several other major projects around the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Martinelli has been involved in the construction business for
more than three decades, and has been identified as an associate of
the Lucchese family and of Crea's since 1990, according to FBI
reports. The documents show that 10 years ago, Martinelli, a
wealthy, successful contractor, received medical benefits through a
Teamsters union local controlled by Crea. Prosecutors also said
that in the current case, six organized crime figures or associates
were collecting benefits as part of the current schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Martinelli was charged with 16 counts of falsifying business
records in the first degree, a felony, in the filing of false
reports to the Cement and Concrete Workers District Council Benefit
Funds.
</P>
<P>
   One man was named in the indictment as a Lucchese associate but
not charged. Investigators said the man, Sean Richard, 35, had
cooperated with the authorities since late last year and was under
police protection.
</P>
<P>
   All of the men taken into custody Wednesday were arraigned at
State Supreme Court in Manhattan, where they were herded into the
jury box to await their appearance before Justice Jeffrey Atlas.
During his arraignment, Crea, his lips pursed, stood with his hands
clasped behind him and uttered only two words, ``Not guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Tangorra, in a brown sweat suit with his hair slicked back, was
unshaven and looked tired. His wife tried to hand him a piece of
chewing gum, but was stopped by a court officer. ``Oh my God, I
need a smoke,'' she said, as the prosecutors rolled in boxes of
documents outlining the case against the men.
</P>
<P>
   Atlas freed all but two of the men, Crea and Tuscello, on bail,
which he set at amounts from $20,000 to $200,000. As the released
defendants left the courtroom, many said they were angered by the
authorities' decision to arrest them in raids rather than simply
ordering them to report to lawyers for court appearances.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move, federal prosecutors in Manhattan on
Wednesday unsealed indictments charging six Lucchese soldiers and
associates, five of whom were charged in the state case, with
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney, Mary Jo White,
said prosecutors in her office were aware of Morgenthau's
investigation, and the FBI assisted in the arrests.

 &HT;    Shaw seeks buyout to Buffett
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -Shaw Industries has offered to sell most of its North
Georgia family carpet dynasty to billionaire Warren Buffett's
holding company for as much as $2.07 billion in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said Wednesday it has agreed to buy
between 80.1 percent and 86 percent of the carpet maker's 126.6
million outstanding shares. The remaining stock would be held by
Shaw Industries management and their families.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise deal values Shaw Industries at $19 a share, a 56
percent premium to its price of $12.19 before trading was halted on
Wednesday. Shaw Industries shares shot up $6.44, or 53 percent, to
$18.63 on news of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Top management at Shaw Industries will stay in charge at the
company's headquarters in Dalton, said Julius Shaw, executive vice
president of investor relations and son of Bud Shaw, chairman
emeritus. Brothers Robert Shaw, chairman and chief executive, and
Bud Shaw own about 11 percent of the company. President Julian Saul
owns about 9 percent. All together, the extended families own about
a third of the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the arrangement, Berkshire Hathaway would favor having
Bob and Julian stay in management for at least a couple of years,''
Julius Shaw said. The Shaw brothers grew up in North Georgia's
carpet industry, which now supplies 80 percent of the nation's
carpets, and took over the family rug dyeing business in the late
'50s. Shaw Industries employs 30,000 people, about two-thirds of
them in Georgia, and runs more than 50 mills in five states.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and investors called the deal a classic Buffett
acquisition. With a portfolio spanning gems, shoes, candy and more,
Buffett is known for buying undervalued businesses with strong
management teams and letting them remain fairly autonomous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warren Buffett is the best value investor that ever walked the
Earth,'' said textile analyst Kay Norwood of Wachovia Securities.
``He looks for value and Shaw certainly represents that.'' The
world's largest carpet maker, Shaw Industries earned $60 million in
the second quarter on about $1.06 billion in revenue. The company
operates 53 plants in five states.
</P>
<P>
   Like other housing suppliers, Shaw Industries has profited from
the boom in residential construction and remodeling in recent
years. But the carpet industry has started to cool with the
economy. Costs of raw materials have gone up, taking a bite out of
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed acquisition needs approval from Shaw Industries'
board of directors. Robert Shaw and Saul, who have approved the
deal, would each keep his 5 percent stake in Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining shares not bought by Berkshire Hathaway would be
held by other Shaw management and members of the Shaw and Saul
families, who would have the option of selling them to the Omaha,
Neb.-based company beginning in March 2002.

 WASHINGTON: a problem. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rep. Heather Wilson, R-N.M., challenged Firestone officials
Wednesday on why the tire maker's safety officials did not take
action if the company's financial staff was aware of a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you looked at it from a financial point of view and not a
consumer safety point of view?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Crigger responded, ``I'm sorry to say that's the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford also gave House investigators Wednesday a copy of an
internal memorandum from March 1999, describing how the company
handled the replacement of problem Firestone tires on Ford
Explorers in Saudi Arabia. A day earlier, Ford had supplied a copy
of the memo with one section blacked out to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   That version showed that Firestone officials had been leery of
sending a letter to tire owners in Saudi Arabia for fear that it
might have to inform the U.S. Department of Transportation and that
it might be banned from the Saudi market. ``They feel that the U.S.
DOT will have to be notified of the program, since the same product
is sold in the U.S.,'' the Ford memo stated.
</P>
<P>
   But the complete memo included a section in which the memo's
author, a Ford official named Chuck Seilnacht, mentioned that a
colleague at Ford shared Firestone's worries.
</P>
<P>
   Corey MacGillivray, an official in Ford's general counsel's
office, ``was concerned about the implications,'' as well, the memo
said. ``He was going to check with one of his colleagues to get
more info.''
</P>
<P>
   Firestone's Crigger said that he had been aware of discussion
within the company's legal department of how to handle tire
problems in Saudi Arabia, but was not familiar with the details.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Firestone, Ford sent a letter to owners of Explorers in
Saudi Arabia several months later that they should get new tires.
Ford also took out advertisements to promote the tire replacement
effort, and covered the program's expense after Firestone refused
to do so on the grounds that the tires were failing because of
customers' misuse.
</P>
<P>
   The tires replaced in Saudi Arabia were 16-inch Wilderness
tires, a size that has not been recalled in the United States,
although some lawyers for consumer contend they should be.
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials repeated Wednesday their contention that they had
asked Firestone repeatedly over the last two years to check the
tires for defects, and had been assured every time that any
problems resulted solely from customers' abuse of the tires.
</P>
<P>
   But senators and representatives were unsympathetic, saying that
Ford had a responsibility to make sure that it put safe tires on
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ford, too, when faced with hundreds of complaints of major
tire defects on the Explorer, failed to respond with the sense of
urgency that one would expect when the safety of so many people
rested on its shoulders,'' said Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers' proposals Wednesday emphasized harsher punishment for
violators of safety rules and closer government monitoring of the
auto industry, with little attention to new safety rules for tires.
A few of the proposals put forward were so far-reaching that even
safety activists spoke against them at the hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., proposed that the Transportation
Department assign inspectors to auto factories much as the
Agriculture Department assigns inspectors to chicken processors,
and that automakers be required to forward their quality-control
data to the government. Joan Claybrook, the nation's top traffic
safety regulator in the Carter administration, said that regulators
did not have the staff necessary for such an ambitious undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said that he planned to introduce
legislation as early as Sept. 13 to establish federal criminal
penalties, possibly enabling a charge such as second-degree
manslaughter, for the executives of companies that knowingly sell
defective products that kill consumers. Automakers barely
successfully lobbied to defeat a similar measure in 1966, when the
nation's auto regulatory system was set up.
</P>
<P>
   Violations of federal auto safety rules are currently punished
with a fine on the manufacturer of no more than $925,000, plus a
mandatory recall of the defective vehicle, auto part or tire.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sen. Shelby, the Alabama Republican who is the chairman of the
Senate Appropriations subcommittee for transportation, which held
one of Wednesday's hearings, said that he would consider an
immediate increase in the budget of the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, which is part of the Department of
Transportation. The agency's budget was cut almost in half at the
beginning of the Reagan administration, and remains one-third lower
than it was in the Carter administration, after adjusting for
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Auto defects have received little attention on Capitol Hill for
many years. Sue Bailey, the safety agency's administrator, pointed
out that the agency recommended on March 24 that Congress enact
tougher laws, including an increase in the limit on civil penalties
to at least $1 million. But no member of Congress has introduced a
bill with these proposals, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The current session of Congress is scheduled to end Oct. 4, with
only 21 more working days. Bills and budget changes introduced this
late in a session usually have little chance of passing, but Sens.
Specter and Shelby said in interviews that Congress and the nation
were so interested in the tire issue that legislative action was
possible. and even likely.
</P>
<P>
   The tire recall appears to have had fairly little effect on
sales of sport utility vehicles. SUV sales rose 5.1 percent in
August from the level of a year earlier, while the overall auto
market was flat. But all of the growth in sport utility sales
occurred in small car-based models like the Chrysler PT Cruiser,
which the auto industry classifies as sport utilities to qualify
for more lenient regulations that cover light trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of larger SUV models like the Ford Explorer, which tend to
be based on pickup truck designs, fell .9 percent in August, partly
because the Explorer itself, the nation's best-selling sport
utility, had a drop of .8 percent. Sales of pickup-based sport
utilities soared in the mid-1990s, but their growth has been
slowing since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., said that he would use the Firestone and
Ford issue to seek quick passage of legislation barring companies
from sealing information relevant to public safety in court
settlements of lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for consumers contend that Ford and Firestone have
hidden many documents with such secrecy orders.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Petrauskas, Ford's vice president for safety and
environmental issues, said Ford only sealed the amounts of
settlements and did not seal engineering information.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for consumers said it does not appear that
Bridgestone/Firestone has softened its litigation stance in the
past week, despite the threat of criminal prosecution in Venezuela,
pressure from federal regulators to recall additional tires and
blistering hearings in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The heightened scrutiny ``has had no effect whatsoever,'' said
Bruce Kaster, a lawyer in Ocala, Fla., who has been a leader in
suing Bridgestone/Firestone over tread separation problems.
``There's no indication of any willingness on their part to soften
their position on discovery or settlements or anything else.''
Firestone is only settling cases, he said, ``when they start
getting nervous.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ President Clinton opened the summit meeting of
world leaders at the United Nations on Wednesday, urging the huge
gathering to prepare the institution for a new age in which
international forces will have to reach regularly and rapidly
inside national boundaries to protect threatened people.
</P>
<P>
   With his own time in the front rank of the 149 world leaders
gathered here drawing to an end, Clinton also used the moment to
try to settle some of the disputes that have dogged his presidency,
from the Middle East to Russia to Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The president met separately into the evening with Prime
Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and then with the Palestinian leader,
Yasser Arafat, in hopes of picking up the broken pieces of the
peace agreement that came tantalizingly close at Camp David in
July. Clinton warned that ``like all life's chances,'' the moment
for an accord ``is fleeting and about to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   And he sparred anew with Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, who
is using the gathering here to propose a ban on military uses of
space, another effort to terminate U.S. efforts to develop a
national missile defense. Clinton's aides gave Putin a summary of
U.S. intelligence gathered during the Kursk submarine disaster,
which suggests that Putin's own naval forces may have misled him in
the days after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was deliberately vague on the question of when the
United Nations should step into civil wars or ethnic and religious
disputes _ an argument that has come up repeatedly during his
presidency. ``These conflicts present us with a stark challenge,''
he said. ``Are they part of the scourge the U.N. was established to
prevent? If so, we must respect sovereignty and territorial
integrity, but still find a way to protect people as well as
borders.''
</P>
<P>
   Just hours before he spoke, three U.N. relief workers were
killed in West Timor, apparently by Indonesian militia forces. The
news, underscoring the risks to U.N. workers as they insert
themselves into uncontrolled disputes, put a chill on the opening
ceremony. As the session began, the U.N. secretary-general, Kofi
Annan, called for a minute of silence to remember the three
international aid workers, as Indonesia's president, Abdurrahman
Wahid, struggling with a clear erosion of his authority at home,
sat in the hall.
</P>
<P>
   With the East Side of Manhattan at a near standstill while a
parade of prime ministers and presidents zoomed through the police
lines, Clinton clearly relished one of his last hurrah's as
president in front of what the United Nations called the largest
gathering of world leaders in history. Rarely has he had a chance
to talk to both adversaries and allies at the same moment, a group
as diverse as President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea and President
Fidel Castro of Cuba, who listened to Clinton but never got close
enough to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stayed in the hall after his speech and, because of an
unexpected change in the order of speakers, heard President
Mohammad Khatami of Iran, with whom the United States still has no
formal dialogue, talk about the clash of Islamic and Western
cultures.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright sat
listening at the back of the huge hall, Khatami declared that in
coming years the world could no longer be ruled by ``monopolies of
power and capital,'' a clear reference to the United States. It was
one of a series of expressions of frustration about America's
global power that emerged as a subtext of the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Clinton spoke of the need to intervene strongly
when a nation's leaders abuse their own people, the president of
China, Jiang Zemin, described a very different concept of how the
world should operate. ``Respect for each other's independence and
sovereignty is vital to the maintenance of world peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Striking a theme often heard from Chinese leaders who fear that
intervention in Kosovo or East Timor could provide the precedent
for one day intervening in Tibet or Taiwan, Jiang added: ``Dialogue
and cooperation in the field of human rights must be conduucted on
the basis of respect for state sovereignty. Without sovereignty,
there will be no human rights to speak of.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of the growing suspicions about America's use of
that power _ or perhaps because of the constant conflict between
the United Nations and Washington over the payment of dues to the
organization _ Clinton did not receive the kind of standing ovation
that greeted him in 1998. During his speech, he made an oblique
reference to Washington's $1.7 billion in arrears to the United
Nations, saying that as the organization expands its missions,
``all these things come with a price tag, and all nations,
including the United States, must pay it.''
</P>
<P>
   He also took a clear shot at conservative Republicans who have
attacked the United Nations, saying, ``Those in my country or
elsewhere who believe we can do without the United Nations, or
impose our will upon it, misread history and misunderstand the
future.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Clinton spoke, he met in the U.N. building with
the president of Vietnam, Tan Duc Luong. He reassured him that a
recent trade accord between the United States and Vietnam would
remain a top priority for the United States, even though he has
decided not to try to win approval of the agreement from Congress
this year. The two men also discussed Clinton's desire to visit
Vietnam before the end of his presidency, which would make him the
first U.S. president to set foot on Vietnamese soil since the end
of the war nearly 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   While the White House made no announcement of such plans, senior
administration officials say that Clinton is likely to visit
Vietnam just before Thanksgiving. He is planning to attend the
annual Asian economic summit in Brunei, and would make a symbolic _
and highly emotional _ visit to Hanoi on the same trip.
</P>
<P>
   Such individual meetings and initiatives always dominate the
opening of the U.N. session in September. But the stated purpose of
this vast summit meeting of leaders is much broader: to set new
priorities and directions for the United Nations, which at age 55
seems creaky and unprepared for a host of new challenges.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the leaders are scheduled to sign a millennium
declaration, calling for a new peacekeeping structure _ a report to
Annan calls for a strengthened corps of commanders in New York,
ready to organize peacekeeping operations in a week or two. It also
sets goals for reducing poverty and illiteracy during the next 15
years, and contains carefully crafted language about guiding
economic globalization so that it benefits the poor as much as the
rich, and small, uncompetitive nations as much as the developed
world.
</P>
<P>
   But as with any document that is signed by so many, the language
is so watered down that discerning its specific meaning is
difficult at best. And it is particularly difficult to pin down the
United Nations' role in managing economic globalization and
development. More and more, that role has fallen to the
institutions that were created at the end of World War II to manage
the world economy _ the World Bank, which focuses on poverty, and
the International Monetary Fund, which seeks to prevent and manage
economic crises.
</P>
<P>
   Their growing role leaves the United Nations increasingly on the
sidelines when it comes to the crucial questions of economic
development _ who gets capital and under what conditions _ and even
their efforts are frequently overshadowed by the billions in
private capital that now slosh through the emerging markets on a
daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   In such an environment, the United Nations' role is chiefly
hortatory. And because the United Nations does not impose the kind
of conditions on its aid that the World Bank and IMF require, from
fiscal prudence to Western-style accounting methods _ it has become
the forum in which many nations want to move the debate over the
rules of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   This has been evident all week on the streets near the United
Nations. There have been globalization teach-ins, and constant talk
inside the United Nations about the growing inequality between rich
and poor nations. But the protests on the streets have been pale
compared to those that rocked the Seattle meeting of the World
Trade Organization late last year, and even those who came here to
make their case were largely drowned out Thursday by the
motorcades, the speeches and the massive security operation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prominent Republicans around the country, including
several who advise Gov. George W. Bush, say they are worried that
his candidacy has floundered in recent weeks, allowing Vice
President Al Gore to build on his velocity from the Democratic
convention in a way they never expected.
</P>
<P>
   While none of these Republicans expressed panic and all said
that Bush could reverse the trend, they acknowledged puzzlement,
frustration and even some distress about the strides that Gore has
made, a degree of progress that they said went beyond an inevitable
tightening in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt about it: There's real worry about the
general state of things,'' said William Bennett, the former
education secretary, who has advised Bush from time to time.
``There's nervousness that was not there before.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews over the past several days, leading Republicans on
Capitol Hill, at state capitals and even at the Bush headquarters
in Austin, Texas, raised concerns beyond poll numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them expressed unease about the way Bush has handled
himself, saying that over the last two and a half weeks there have
been too many instances when he seemed either defensive, bumbling,
weary, detached or peevish.
</P>
<P>
   And there have been too many missteps, several Republicans said.
For starters, they cited Bush's refusal to go along with the debate
schedule proposed by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential
Debates, saying his reluctance had made him look timid and was
diverting attention from issues that he would be better off
discussing.
</P>
<P>
   Others said he was letting Gore drag him into the bogs of a
policy debate, where the vice president is at his best. Still
others said that Bush's choice of Dick Cheney as a running mate had
produced scant excitement on the campaign trail but significant
damage in the news media, manifest in weeks of questions about the
financial details of Cheney's retirement from Halliburton, an
energy services company where he served as chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   And several Republican officials said they had serious
reservations about the party's tongue-in-cheek TV commercial
broadcast last week that challenged Gore's truthfulness and
political consistency.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, chairman of the House Budget
Committee, said the campaign was too preoccupied with trying to
make everyone happy and was not delivering a clear message.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest mistake we can make is to try to be all things to
all people,'' he said. ``We have to be very aggressive and not
engage in any reticence about our philosophy or our positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, dismissed the
worries about the state of the governor's candidacy, which was so
dominant for most of the year. ``Everybody wants to win in a
landslide,'' he said. ``Landslides are rare. We've always known and
said this was going to be a close race.''
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of some Republicans, Bush successfully began the
process of correcting his campaign this week. On Tuesday, he moved
aggressively to neutralize Gore's advantage on the critical issue
of health care by releasing his own plan to give prescription drug
benefits to the elderly. And Bush has been engaging Gore much more
forcefully in his comments and oratory.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans said the combined e1}ect of Gore's surge and
Bush's stumbles had made Gore, for perhaps the first time in the
2000 presidential race, the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Many said they were unnerved by voter surveys showing that Gore
_ who for months lagged in the polls _ had pulled even or ahead of
Bush nationally and in some important states like Florida,
Pennsylvania and Missouri, where campaign officials have long
predicted probable victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody expected a bounce, but not nearly as much as this,''
said Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., referring to Gore. And he said that
it had significantly altered the mood of Republicans in his state,
a crucial battleground.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of chatter at the grass-roots level about how
they're scared of these new numbers,'' he said. ``This has shocked
the system from what looked like a slam dunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, a Republican who has campaigned
with Bush in his state, another battleground, for the last three
days, said: ``I'm at a loss to explain the rather significant
change in the polling numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ridge said he was confident Bush would recover, he said,
``We've got to go a little bit more on the offensive.'' He added of
Gore, ``This guy's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in the nearly three weeks since the end of the
Democratic convention, Gore has been constantly on the offensive,
first declaring himself as the candidate of the little guy and
portraying Bush and Cheney as beholden to big oil and
pharmaceutical companies and then relentlessly attacking Bush over
tax policy and health care.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Gore has managed to use the favorable attention
he received during the convention, particularly the much publicized
kiss he planted on his wife, Tipper, before his acceptance speech,
to give life and personality to his image, which had been stiff and
uninteresting.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican official closely involved in the Bush campaign said
that the Texas governor's aides had readjusted their expectations
for a spate of new polls that will be released over the next few
days.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as two weeks ago, the official said, Bush's aides
were forecasting that these polls would show the race in a dead
heat. But these aides were now predicting that Gore would have, on
average, a 3-to-5-point percent advantage.
</P>
<P>
   An adviser to the Bush campaign in Washington said: ``After the
convention, I thought it was going to be difficult for Gore to come
out better than tied. Today, I think anybody forced to wager on the
race would have to bet on Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   An official of the Republican National Committee, said, ``You're
always on the defensive when your lead evaporates.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interviews, Republicans of all ideological stripes were
hardly unified in dispensing advice for Bush, or in gauging the
health of his candidacy. Several Republicans said that Bush was
merely being buffeted by cyclical forces, which might change
several times again before Election Day. Others said that Bush's
position on debates made at least as much sense to voters as
Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   But some concerns about Bush's campaign were mentioned time and
again.
</P>
<P>
   For example, several Republicans said Bush still needed to be
more aggressive in explaining his proposal for a tax cut of $1.3
trillion over 10 years, more than double the size of Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get very worried about that kind of a tax cut with the
speculative nature of the surplus,'' said Sen. Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania. ``That, I think, has to be spelled out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridge said he was heartened that Bush has begun to cite real
families to explain his tax cut _ but that he could do more. ``You
talk about tax cuts in the abstract,'' he said, ``and people's eyes
glaze over.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter and other Republicans said it was a mistake for the Bush
campaign to sign off on a Republican Party commercial that poked
fun at Gore for appearing at a Buddhist temple fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's wise to do a tongue in cheek,'' Specter
said. ``It's got to be treated very seriously and in a factual way
with no apologies _ but not tongue in cheek.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people close to the campaign even said that officials at
the Republican National Committee warned that the commercial was
inappropriate because it moved the discourse away from issues.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was also cited by many Republicans as a disappointing
choice of a running mate for Bush, especially compared to Sen.
Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, who has helped energize the
Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can recover, but he's not gotten off the dime,'' Upton, the
congressman from Michigan, said of Cheney. ``The focus, rather than
on his solid record of achievement, particularly as the secretary
of defense, and then in the private sector, has been totally
eclipsed by personal finances.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett put it this way: ``The Lieberman pick looks pretty
solid. He's a happy camper out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Imploring Bush to campaign harder, he added, ``They could put
more on their schedule. Gore's certainly been very energetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans also said that despite his proposal for debates
this week, Bush was unwise to make an issue out of the format for
his televised encounters with Gore. ``He is proposing debates that
will arguably reach fewer people,'' said a Bush adviser. ``You
can't sell a Chevy and say it's a Cadillac.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several Republicans said, Bush has at times failed
to muster the sunny geniality and bravado that have always been his
strongest suits.
</P>
<P>
   He has fumbled with his mathematical figures and his words. In
an interview late last week, at a time when he might be expected to
be as pumped up by the gathering frenzy as ever, Bush instead grew
prematurely reflective and slightly teary as he mulled over what he
said was the greatness of American democracy.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Sunday, as he showed snippets of
videotape to support his charge that Gore was backing out of an
agreement to debate anytime and anywhere, he tapped his foot and
occasionally pursed his lips.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Bush, who prizes himself on discipline, was caught
making a vulgar utterance about a reporter into a microphone. While
many political analysts said that the incident would cause no major
damage, others said it could feed into perceptions of Bush as
insufficiently experienced or mature for the task at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still a relative rookie at the national level,'' said
Bruce Buchanan, a government professor at the University of Texas
in Austin, ``and that's showing right now.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the concerns, some Republicans said that while they were
sobered by the situation, they were not scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a period right before and during the Republican
convention where it looked like Bush would sail away with this,''
said Sen. Peter Fitzgerald of Illinois. ``We've all come back to
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Scarborough of Florida said, ``The campaign actually
started yesterday in earnest. If Bush was going to have a problem,
he picked the right time to have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Paxon, a former House member who is an adviser to the
campaign, said Republicans who expected Bush to be ahead now were
guilty of ``Alice in Wonderland'' thinking. ``I believe that it's
going to be a tight race to the finish,'' he said. ``But I am as
confident of victory as I was six month ago. George W. Bush is
going to be the next president.''

CLINTON TALKS WITH BARAK AND ARAFAT, BUT NO PROGRESS REPORTED 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In back-to-back sessions Wednesday evening, President
Clinton met with the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and then
the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, to salvage the progress made
in peace talks last month, but afterward the White House said there
was little movement.
</P>
<P>
   The president's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said that, as expected,
``no breakthrough'' was achieved. ``But the process is not broken
down, it is ongoing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mood was downbeat, after Clinton met with the leaders in the
upper floors of the Waldorf-Astoria in a kind of hasty urban
reprise of the bucolic Camp David talks six weeks ago. To build
pressure on the leaders, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met
with Arafat as he waited for Barak to finish with the president,
and she also met with Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia before
he sat down with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the president had reviewed possible compromises
with the leaders on the main issues, including the future status of
Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees, but he declined to
give details. The session with Barak was quite brief, less than an
hour, and the meeting with Arafat, with whom the Americans feel
they need to do the most work, lasted about 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said there were no proposals Wednesday night for the
next steps in the process. ``I don't want to say there is no hope
for next steps _ I don't know what it is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, administration officials said that once Wednesday's
highly anticipated meetings were over, the president would be
assessing whether it would be worthwhile to bring the leaders
together again in another meeting in the manner of the Camp David
meeting. They said this would be done only if the leaders were
close to signing an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   With a full array of world leaders in town, the White House
seemed to be seeking out Arab leaders in particular in their effort
to persuade Arafat that time was running out for a peace agreement.
Clinton met with Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia after his session
with Arafat and earlier Albright spoke with the Egyptian foreign
minister, Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, both Barak and Arafat spoke from the
rostrum of the General Assembly, stating fairly familiar positions
that included more generous terms than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Barak called Jerusalem ``the eternal capital of Israel'' and
then went on to say: ``We recognize that Jerusalem is also sacred
to Muslims and Christians the world over, and cherished by our
Palestinian neighbors.'' He also stressed the short timetable,
which the United States believes is framed by the return of the
Israeli Parliament at the end of October. Barak has only a one-vote
majority in the Parliament and faces the likelihood of having to
call an election. Without a peace agreement, it would be an
election he could well lose. ``History will judge what we do in the
next days and weeks,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Arafat said: ``We remain committed to our national
rights over East Jerusalem, capital of our state and shelter of our
sacred sites, as well as our rights on the Christian and Islamic
holy sites, maintaining that the city should be accessible to all,
and open onto its western side.''
</P>
<P>
   In a reflection of the touch-and-go dynamics of the peace
process, a senior administration official said before Clinton's
meetings Wednesday that the positions of the parties had slipped
some since Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   There had been some ``forward movement'' in some areas, but in
other areas, ``I would say that they haven't necessarily stayed
exactly where they were,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration said that during Camp David
considerable headway had been made on subjects that had been taboo,
particularly the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   But the senior administration official said that ``it's been
hard to build on the advances that were made.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Palestinian official, Saeb Erekat, who had been quite
optimistic after Camp David, said that more than two dozen meetings
between the two sides in the last six weeks had produced little.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said they expected Arafat to return home
this weekend to meet with the Palestinian Central Council, where a
decision would be made on whether to declare a Palestinian state.
Palestinian officials have indicated that rather than declare a
state on Sept. 13, as they had pledged, November or even later
might be set as a new date.
</P>
<P>
   A number of European and Islamic nations have encouraged Arafat
to delay his declaration of a state and concentrate on a peace
settlement with Israel.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Cherie Booth, the wife of the British prime minister, strode
purposefully into a thicket of unflattering headlines last month
when she wrote a newspaper article praising Britain's Human Rights
Act, a central element of her husband's legislative program and the
basis for much of her work as a high-powered international lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, she demonstrated that even the Tories' efforts to
compare her to Hillary Clinton and Lady Macbeth _ in the same
breath, and not as a compliment _ had not dissuaded her from
pursuing what has become an unprecedented, and increasingly public,
role. At a forum sponsored by New York University, she joined a
panel of lawyers from Britain and the United States in a spirited
debate on human rights, here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Booth, as she is known professionally, was discussing the
revolution taking place in English courts as the country prepares
to adopt the European Convention on Human Rights into domestic law,
effectively giving Britons their first bill of rights ever. But she
was breaking new ground by discussing anything at all.
</P>
<P>
   No Prime Minister's spouse _ including Sir Denis Thatcher,
Margaret Thatcher's discreet and sporting husband _ has ever opened
his or her mouth in public before in anything but the most
innocuous way.
</P>
<P>
   Norma Major, John Major's wife, was best known for her expertise
on the opera. Denis Thatcher, who tended to walk demurely behind
his wife, once observed that ``she runs the country; I run the
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Byron Shafer, the Andrew Mellon professor of American government
at Oxford University said, ``Before Cherie Blair, in some sense the
role model for the prime minister's spouse would have been someone
like Lady Bird Johnson. They could have public causes _ saving
species and beautifying highways _ things that no one could
criticize.''
</P>
<P>
   But Booth, who until recently has deliberately stayed out of
politics and who never speaks to reporters, has taken on a much
more explosive cause: human rights. In an article in the Daily
Telegraph co-written with one of her law partners, Rabinder Singh,
she said that the Human Rights Act, which takes effect on Oct. 2,
would ``bring rights home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Human Rights Act forms an integral part of the
government's program of Constitutional reform, which has the aim of
modernizing Britain to make it a strong a confident democracy in
the 21st century,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But the article provoked an outpouring of sniping from
conservative-minded Britons who believe that the new law will
produce a deluge of lawsuits and upend many of England's traditions
by setting individual rights _ of gays, criminal suspects and the
like _ above the rights of the state.
</P>
<P>
   John Bercow, a home affairs spokesman for the Conservative Party
and a man known for his pungent metaphors, was dispatched to lead
the party's attack. Accusing Booth of suffering from ``Hillary
syndrome,'' Bercow said that ``people in Britain will not put up
with anyone who thinks she can be an unaccountable cross between
first lady and Lady Macbeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaving Lady Macbeth out of it, Booth has gone further than
Hillary Clinton in pursuing her own career, even as her husband
pursues his. Sometimes the two courses seem almost contradictory.
As a lawyer specializing in employment law, she is often called on
to challenge laws enacted by the government or decisions made by
public authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, hers is the more radical departure,'' Shafer of
Oxford said. ``She's said, `I'm having a life of my own, and it's a
public life, and it's going to go on.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the attack seemed to backfire, as even some
Conservatives bristled at Bercow's insinuation that perhaps Booth
should not have a job at all. Even so, said Ann McElvoy, a
columnist for The Independent in London, Booth put herself in a
newly vulnerable position by inserting herself so publicly into
such an explosive issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cherie is a very political person,'' McElvoy said. ``Where
there's perhaps a bit of a conflict is that she was very
deliberately using Blairite language to describe what the human
rights law will achieve. It's very hard, as Hillary Clinton found
out, to go back into the shadows once you've come out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Booth, who temporarily slipped out of the conference
Wednesday, colleagues said, to breast-feed her baby, has proved
remarkably unperturbed by the fuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is very tough, Cherie,'' said Nick Martin, chief executive
of Matrix, the human-rights-minded law firm set up in a blaze of
publicity by Booth and an number of other high-profile lawyers last
spring. ``She wants to get on with it and do her job. Her only
worry would be that her partners would feel that it distracted from
Matrix's work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tories also picked on Booth when it emerged that she had
held legal meetings with clients in the Blair family apartment
above No. 11 Downing Street.
</P>
<P>
   ''The taxpayer pays for Downing Street as a place to live and
work for the prime minister,'' sniffed John Redwood, a top-ranking
Conservative. ``A member of the prime minister's family should not
be using No. 10 or No. 11 for business purposes. It's as simple as
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Booth _ who spoke recently during a case involving parental
leave about the ``culture of discrimination'' forcing women ``to
struggle with the balance of work and family life'' _ was on
maternity leave at the time, a Downing Street spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Downing Street is Mrs. Blair's home,'' the spokesman said.
``As a mother with a small baby, it is not unreasonable for her to
work from home.''

WILL MP3 RULING QUASH INNOVATION?

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If the $118 &UR;  &LR; million verdict against MP3.com buys
Universal Music Group and the music industry anything, it's time --
time to find their way online, analysts said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Upstaged by upstarts like the free song-swapping service Napster
and music downloader MP3.com, the five major labels have fumbled
for the right formula to sell their tunes over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Now with MP3.com reeling from a potentially fatal blow, the
industry has a chance to take make a stronger presence in this
emerging field, industry observers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to keep everyone else on the sidelines as far as
creating legitimate ways of getting music online,'' said Heath
Terry of Credit Suisse First Boston's office in San Francisco.
``MP3.com was by and far the most copyright-conscious service on
the Internet and they got hit with what could be a $250 million
verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   The amount of damages will depend on how many of Universal's
compact discs MP3.com put online for people to listen to if they
could prove they already owned a copy.
</P>
<P>
   While estimates vary on how many discs MP3.com was found to have
willfully infringed upon, each will draw $25,000 in damages.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego-based Web company has already also set aside $150
million to cover legal expenses and the settlements it reached with
the other four major labels before trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way they're going to survive if Universal collects
$250 million,'' said David Bench, an analyst with Arnhold &AMP; S.
Bleichroeder in New York. ``How they will survive is if they cut a
deal with Universal before that. This definitely gives Universal
more leverage in terms of negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts largely said MP3.com blundered in not getting the
labels' permission to post the albums on its controversial
``MyMP3.com'' service.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has shown even less tolerance for Napster, where
people can freely download Top 10 hits, obscure tracks, even whole
albums before they are released. The five major labels banded
together to get Napster shut down in July, but it remains online
pending an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But for all its opposition to these services, the record
industry has not offered any other means of getting music that the
public has embraced. Insiders said the main stumbling block was
preserving copyright, which the rulings in these two cases appear
to bolster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it's all about slamming the brakes on any innovation
out there so they can figure this out first,'' Terry said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Napster and MP3.com cases were also closely watched
because they had broad implications for Internet content.
</P>
<P>
   ``This definitely set a precedence for copyright issues in
general, whether it's music or videos,'' Bench said. ``It shows you
don't step on the toes of the big companies.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, MP3.com will continue to serve as one of the leading
sites for thousands of aspiring musicians who post their songs and
press kits, hoping to gain exposure, Bench said.
</P>
<P>
   One such musician, Brett White, said he doubts MP3.com will fold
even if the staggering damages are enforced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still going to be a warehouse of unknown music and it
doesn't take much money to maintain that server space,'' said
White, 34, of Hollywood. ``But it will probably shut down the ways
they're trying to be innovative.''

SUMMIT WATCHING: WHO WAS THAT MAN IN THE SUIT? 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD WONG and ELISA GOOTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The television cameras and reporters raced across the
marble lobby of the Waldorf-Astoria and swarmed around the Chinese
man in a dark suit. Was he a high-ranking party official? Perhaps
President Jiang Zemin himself?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly. It was William Chiu, chairman of the American Fujian
Association of Commerce and Industry. He had just left a meeting
with President Jiang. On Tuesday morning, more than 300 Chinese
American community leaders, businessmen and scholars gathered at
the hotel to hobnob with the leader of the world's most populous
country. About a third were from the New York area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meeting was just great,'' said Chiu, an insurance agent
who lives in the Long Island community of Setauket. ``It's like
we're in the same family.''
</P>
<P>
   There were even Taiwanese Americans at the meeting, but they
never raised the issue of Taiwan independence because the meeting
was ``a family talk,'' Chiu said.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance agent was among a crowd that welcomed Jiang
earlier this week when he flew in. But a cadre of pro-Tibet
protesters had also shown up, something that Chiu would rather
forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want their freedom, but they should give us our freedom
too,'' he said. ``Don't bother us, don't interrupt us.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Jiang was in town for the rest of the week, would Chiu be
meeting with him again?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's very busy,'' the insurance agent said. ``There
are 1.2 billion people in China. He has a lot of work to do.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Room Service Stampede  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With more than 30 heads of state on the premises, the
Waldorf-Astoria finds itself this week having to provide literally
world-class service in ways it has never done before. Where
gastronomic matters are concerned, such an undertaking would bring
stomachaches to many a chef.
</P>
<P>
   Not so at the Waldorf, said Christophe Le Chatton, director of
food and beverage operations. The hotel has doubled the number of
cooks on duty, and quadrupled the number of room service waiters.
</P>
<P>
   ``To coordinate how to make them happy is important,'' Le
Chatton said of the world leaders. ``They're all equally important
in their own mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The requests are as varied as the languages heard these days in
the hotel lobby. There is, for instance, the state leader who
insists on drinking papaya juice. World affairs being what they
are, Le Chatton remained discreet about that dignitary's identity.
``I  &UR; never &LR;  give out names,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the delegates who asked the hotel to fetch Thai
food from a local restaurant, and those who brought their own
chefs. (China and India, for instance.) Space in the kitchen was
cleared away, woks were provided. But the chefs brought with them
their own knives, strictly for use in the kitchen, not in plenary
sessions or backroom conferences. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In New York to Talk Trash  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most dignitaries converged on the city to ponder things like
world poverty and globalization, but a few arrived with humble
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda's health minister, Dr. Ezechias Rwabuhihi, found time to
to talk about garbage trucks, landfills and sewage treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like New Yorkers have a lot of expertise in these
matters,'' said Isidore Munyiakazi, an official at the Rwandan
mission to the United Nations, who accompanied Rwabuhihi on his
visit Tuesday to the Sanitation Department's Worth Street
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   If New York can cope with its trash, Rwanda should be able to
handle the waste generated by its growing population, Munyiakazi
reasoned. ``People leave their garbage outside, then the city tries
to collect it. But we don't have enough cars, we don't have enough
personnel and we don't have enough landfills,'' Munyiakazi said.
</P>
<P>
   Chief William Jelley, who heads the agency's Bureau of Cleaning
and Collection, briefed the minister, who seemed to have trouble
finding the office, said Peter C. Fenty, a Sanitation Department
spokesman. ``I guess they ran into Gramercy Park, which can be a
surprise.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Northrop Grumman Corp. will pay $302 million to
buy Federal Data Corp., a privately held information systems
supplier for the federal government, Northrop announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction includes approximately $127 million in cash,
$157 million in debt and $18 million in other transaction costs.
The acquisition is not expected to affect Northrop Grumman's
current fiscal-year profits, but will likely add earnings next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Bishop, Northrop's manager of corporate public information
said the company plans to fold Federal Data into its Logicon
information-technology unit. Logicon, based in Herndon, Va., had
sales of $1.5 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Northrop expects the deal to close within 45 days, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Bethesda, Md., Federal Data, currently owned by the
investment firm The Carlyle Group, reported revenues of $584
million last year. Its clients include the Internal Revenue
Service, the Pentagon, the Veterans Administration and the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration. It employs 1,400 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The acquisition of Federal Data is an excellent strategic fit
with Logicon, our information technology sector, which is one of
the company's key engines of growth,'' said Kent Kresa, Northrop's
chairman and chief executive officer, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, Federal Data was awarded an eight-year $260
million NASA contract under which it will develop, build and
operate microgravity research facilities and payloads for space
shuttle missions and the International Space Station.
</P>
<P>
   The Veterans Administration also recently awarded Federal Data a
$55 million contract extension to provide continuing information
technology support for its benefits modernization program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coupled with our recent acquisition of Comptek Research, we
continue to acquire businesses with significant growth prospects
which we believe will provide long-term value for our
shareholders,'' Kresa said.
</P>
<P>
   Northrop Grumman, the fifth-largest U.S. defense contractor,
provides systems integration, defense electronics and information
technology to the United States and international military,
government and commercial clients.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles-based company had revenues of $7.6 billion in
1999 and has a work force of approximately 37,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Northrop fell 12.5 cents, or 0.16 percent, Wednesday
to close at 79.94 on moderate volume of 480,700 shares traded on
the New York Stock Exchange.

DASIBI LANDS CHINA DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MONROE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE _ Dasibi Environmental entered the realm of giants
Wednesday, inking a joint venture to build air quality measurement
equipment in China.
</P>
<P>
   Dasibi's deal with Shenyang Dongyu is worth an estimated $200
million in sales as the two companies supply 680 cities in China
with the equipment. To the officials present at a signing ceremony
Wednesday, it's also a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be big to do business in China,'' said Mary
Delmege, western regional director of the U.S. Department of
Commerce. ``There's a large perception that the big international
trade deals are only for big companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement marks the culmination of six years of negotiations
between Dasibi, which employs 55 people, and Dongyu, which was
drawn to the American company by the relationship it had with trade
officials in the Chinese government. In April 1999, Dasibi launched
a 25-city air quality monitoring project in connection with China's
environmental protection agency.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for Dongyu, based in the city of Shenyang, to
build Dasibi monitoring equipment and distribute among client
cities. Dasibi said air pollution in major Chinese cities rivals or
even exceeds that of Los Angeles. The purchase is indicative of
that government's attempt to update its monitoring capabilities,
said Dasibi Project Engineer Eric Lai.
</P>
<P>
   ``The air quality is getting worse so the government wants to do
whatever we do,'' Lai said.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Gosselin, president and chief executive officer of
Dasibi's parent Pollution Research and Control Corp., said it will
provide the lion's share of his company's business for at least
five years. Given that China has imported $3 billion in pollution
control equipment, the magnitude of the relationship hasn't yet
been realized, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good-sized market no matter how you multiply it,'' said
Gosselin, who jokingly calls his company a ``Fortune 5 million''
firm, a riff on Fortune magazine's Fortune 500 listing of the
United States' biggest companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dasibi has a very good (technology),'' said Dongyu Chairman
and President Zhuang Yuyang at the ceremony. ``If the (technology)
can find a market, everything is possible.''

   Olympic `swim doctor' comes under scrutiny
</P>
<P>
   By DANNY ROBBINS
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ An Austin nutritionist who describes himself as a
Ph.D. in nutritional counseling and has been advising U.S. Olympic
swimmers Dara Torres and Jenny Thompson on the use of dietary
supplements received his doctorate from a school that offers its
courses through the mail and is unaccredited, leading some to
question whether he should be working with Olympic athletes in such
a sensitive area.
</P>
<P>
   Glen R. Luepnitz, who has been labeled an ``expert'' on dietary
supplements by U.S. women's swim coach Richard Quick and is due to
work with U.S. swimmers at the Olympics in Sydney, received his
doctorate from LaSalle University in Mandeville, La., an
institution that was widely known as a so-called ``diploma mill''
at the time of his enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   Records show Luepnitz enrolled in the LaSalle program in April
1995 and was awarded a doctorate in nutrition counseling two years
later after completing eight courses _ all by mail _ and a
``doctoral project.'' He had previously received a bachelor's
degree in education from the University of Texas in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   LaSalle has never been accredited by a recognized accrediting
agency and four years ago was enmeshed in a federal investigation
focusing on the school's founder, Thomas Kirk, and its parent
organization, the World Christian Church.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1996, the LaSalle offices were raided by agents from a
joint task force of the FBI, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and
the Internal Revenue Service. Kirk subsequently pleaded guilty to
one count of conspiring to commit wire fraud, credit-card fraud and
tax evasion. He is now serving a five-year prison sentence at the
federal correctional complex in Beaumont.
</P>
<P>
   The government contended that thousands of students were handled
by a faculty of less than 10, most of whom lacked traditional
academic degrees, and that the accrediting agency listed by the
school was in fact a fictitious entity created by Kirk consisting
of nothing more than a mailing address and an answering service.
</P>
<P>
   The school was reorganized in July 1997 when it came under the
control of a nonprofit corporation, LaSalle Education Corp., and
its name was recently changed to Orion College. As part of the
restructuring, the school stopped offering doctorate degrees.
</P>
<P>
   John Bear, author of Bear's Guide to Earning Degrees
Nontraditionally, said a degree awarded by LaSalle before mid-1997
should be viewed as a ``time bomb'' on any resume, particularly
that of someone in a health-related field.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in a borderline health area, as nutrition is, it's
especially dangerous to go out there as a doctor (with a LaSalle
Ph.D.),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Luepnitz, 41, provides nutritional counseling for cancer
patients as well as athletes. He works out of an office at Lone
Star Oncology, a clinic set up by Austin physician John Costanzi,
and claims affiliation with several other health-care
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Since May, he has served as an unpaid adviser on matters
relating to diet and dietary supplements for Torres, Thompson and
other swimmers who train at Stanford University, a role he assumed
after coming to the attention of Quick, the women's swim coach at
Stanford and a former coach at the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Luepnitz worked with Quick's swimmers at the Olympic trials last
month in Indianapolis and is due to continue in that position at
the Olympics in Sydney, where Quick will serve as head coach of the
U.S. women's team.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, 33, is expected to be one of the Games' biggest stories.
She has qualified for the Olympics in three individual events and a
relay, a remarkable achievement in light of the fact she returned
to competitive swimming last summer after a seven-year layoff. When
she swims in Sydney, she will become the first U.S. swimmer to make
four Olympic appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, 27, has qualified to compete in three events. A third
Quick-trained swimmer _ Stanford senior Misty Hyman _ has qualified
in one.
</P>
<P>
   Luepnitz defended his doctorate, saying it is comparable to
those awarded in a more traditional fashion. He said his work
included a thesis that ran between 300 and 400 typewritten pages
(with another 150 pages of charts) and was on the subject of
``developing wellness programs for long-term health.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he elected to obtain a doctorate from LaSalle because he
was trying to continue his education while working and raising a
family and because he wanted to be involved with a school
accredited by a church-related organization. He said it was his
understanding the school had been ``set up by monks'' and
accredited by a ``theological-type'' organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what their practices were with other students or
what their practices were in general, how they handled other
things,'' he said. ``But for me, it was an extremely positive
experience. It allowed me to accomplish something in my life that
otherwise I wouldn't have been able to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he has made Quick and others associated with the U.S.
Olympic swim team aware of the nature of his academic record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about it,'' Luepnitz said. ``They asked me in
the past where I went to school, and I tried to give them all the
information I possibly can, because it's better to give them the
information and then that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   An attempt to contact Quick through USA Swimming, the governing
body for swimming in the United States, was unsuccessful. The U.S.
swim team left Sunday for Brisbane, Australia, where it will train
prior to the start of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Luepnitz as ``Dr. Luepnitz,'' Quick talked
extensively about the nutritionist at the Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   Quick said he was concerned by the furor over home-run king Mark
McGwire's use of the supplement androstenedione and wanted input
from someone who could help athletes deal with questions regarding
it and other supplements. He said he was in Austin in the spring
visiting his daughter, learned of Luepnitz's work, and decided to
seek the nutritionist's help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an expert in that field,'' Quick said, ``so I wanted
an expert in that field working with my athletes. I didn't want
them relying on the sales person in the local nutritional store.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick said he had created a foundation to raise funds so
Luepnitz and other support personnel involved with the Stanford
swimmers could go to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, speaking to reporters on a conference call before the
trials, cited Luepnitz as a critical factor in the success she and
other swimmers training with Quick had experienced. She said
Luepnitz had given the Stanford swimmers a legal way to keep up
with those using performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather not get into detail about what we're doing, because
you can't give away all your secrets,'' she said, ``but he's really
helped the team a lot in trying to get us to where the cheaters are
without cheating.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of Torres and Thompson at the trials led other
Olympic swimmers and their coaches to seek out Luepnitz for advice.
Luepnitz said last week he had drawn blood from 40 Olympic swimmers
to analyze their nutritional needs and that he is working with all
members of the Olympic team, both men and women, ``in one way of
another.''
</P>
<P>
   Luepnitz identifies himself as Glen R. Luepnitz, Ph.D., on his
resume and business cards. His e-mail address includes the
designation ``drnutrition.'' His resume states that he holds a
doctorate in nutritional counseling from LaSalle University but
makes no mention of the school's location, method of operation or
accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   Luepnitz provided his resume to the Chronicle during an
interview in his office Aug. 29. Three days later, after the
Chronicle had made inquiries regarding his background, he contacted
the newspaper and faxed transcripts showing he had obtained an
undergraduate degree from UT and a doctorate from LaSalle
University in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   The LaSalle transcript shows he received a doctorate in
nutrition counseling by completing 30 hours of course work in two
years. He received 24 credit hours for passing eight courses and
another six hours for completing a ``doctoral project.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctorate program completed by Luepnitz differs markedly
from those offered at conventional colleges and universities, where
earning a Ph.D. typically requires about 90 hours of course and
research credit at the graduate level, the first 30 or so hours
leading to a master's degree. A legitimate doctorate program
generally takes a minimum of four years to complete.
</P>
<P>
   Claire Given, LaSalle's director of marketing, said all courses
offered by the school at the time it was operated by Kirk and the
World Christian Church consisted entirely of reading a book and
writing a paper. She said the school also routinely awarded course
credit based on the previous job experience of students.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the school's direction at the time, she said, its
course credit was subject to inconsistencies in faculty
credentials, grading practices and prerequisite standards.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI affidavit filed in federal court shortly after agents
raided the LaSalle offices said the school employed five people in
1996 to grade the papers of 6,293 students. The affidavit quoted a
former LaSalle employee as saying standards were so lax that papers
were sometimes graded based on weight and length instead of
content.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bear, who has provided expert testimony regarding
phony schools as well as written about them, even if Luepnitz had
the best of intentions in enrolling in the LaSalle program, he
would not have received anything resembling a legitimate doctorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say with absolute certainty there's no way a LaSalle
doctorate from that era can represent real academic work,'' Bear
said, ``no matter what was going on in his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Students who received LaSalle degrees prior to the school's
reorganization in mid-1997 have been given the option of turning in
their diplomas and receiving refunds, but few have taken that step.
Some have been prosecuted for using LaSalle doctorates to obtain
teaching and other doctorate-level positions.
</P>
<P>
   Bear said many individuals with LaSalle doctorates slip through
the cracks because employers and others believe the degrees were
awarded by La Salle University in Philadelphia, a well-known and
respected institution.
</P>
<P>
   Luepnitz's academic credentials are significant because he is
involved with Olympic athletes in an area that has generated
considerable debate.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians involved in sports medicine often warn that dietary
supplements, which are largely unregulated, offer few benefits and
numerous risks. They cite inconsistent manufacturing, poor labeling
and other factors in explaining why supplements should be avoided
for health reasons as well as the possibility of unknowingly
ingesting a banned substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't much you can know about these, because they
haven't been studied,'' said Edward R. Laskowski, a physician who
serves as co-director of the Sports Medicine Center at the Mayo
Clinic in Rochester, Minn. ``And what we do know about some
potential ill effects and the downside of taking a substance you
don't know the purity of, it seems like playing Russian roulette.
You can get away with it for a while, but maybe you won't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care how many degrees you have, if you don't know the
long-term effects, you should be wary. A supplement like creatine,
we don't know what this stuff may do to a guy who's been taking it
10 years, starting at age 15. It's like tobacco. It may take awhile
for the effects to show up.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Bryan W. Smith, team physician for the University
of North Carolina athletic program and chairman of the NCAA's
competitive safeguards committee, most of the positive drug tests
involving college athletes can be tied to substances found in
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It truly is one of those things where I don't know if anybody
can feel safe in saying, `I take this, and I take it in this
quantity,''' he said. ``Most of these things, frankly, for the
majority of individuals are probably OK. But we really don't know
the answer. If you're on the opposite side of the fence, and you
have a bad outcome (positive drug test), well, you're a
statistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Luepnitz said he agrees with the notion that using supplements
comes with risk but doesn't believe they should be avoided
altogether. He said he has developed detailed information about
various brands and vendors and uses it in counseling Torres,
Thompson and the other swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before they take anything, we talk about what brand it is,
where they bought it, whether it's any good or not, the whole
works,'' Luepnitz said. ``It's a lot of pressure. It's a lot of
responsibility.''

DASIBI LANDS CHINA DEAL

   GLENDALE _ Dasibi Environmental entered the realm of giants
Wednesday, inking a joint venture to build air quality measurement

   LOS ANGELES _ Litton Industries announced Wednesday that it beat
analysts' fourth-quarter estimates but was punished on Wall Street
anyway by forward-looking investors.
</P>
<P>
   The military shipbuilder pared down its earnings estimate for
the first quarter of the new fiscal year and watched its stock
value drop 24 percent. Analysts said increasingly skittish
investors have their doubts about the rebound Litton predicted in
succeeding quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What wound up happening was, essentially, that their
(first-quarter) earnings will be 10 (percent) to 20 percent below
last year but they will hit earnings targets in Q2, 3 and 4,'' said
Thomas Meagher of BB&AMP;T Capital Markets. ``There was some healthy
skepticism about their that.''
</P>
<P>
   Litton considers 2001 a rebuilding year. Though it earned $1.52
per share in the fourth quarter and beat Wall Street estimates of
$1.49 per share, it anticipated that earnings would be 10 percent
to 20 percent less in the first quarter of the 2001 fiscal year
than a year entire fiscal year, it forecast earnings growth of only
zero to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company attributed that to a ``changing product mix'' in its
shipbuilding operations, adding more new projects with high
front-end costs as opposed to ongoing projects that improve cash
flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our efforts are focused on building a foundation to
accelerate growth in sales earnings and cash flow,'' said Litton
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Michael R. Brown in a
Wednesday morning conference call to investors.
</P>
<P>
   Litton shares fell 81.25 cents to close at $41.25 on heavy
volume of 2.23 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is just unavailing of any shortcomings these
days,'' said Meagher.

   Litton considers 2001 a rebuilding year. Though it earned $1.52
per share in the fourth quarter and beat Wall Street estimates of
$1.49 per share, it anticipated that earnings would be 10 percent
to 20 percent less in the first quarter of the 2001 fiscal year
than a year entire fiscal year, it forecast earnings growth of only
zero to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company attributed that to a ``changing product mix'' in its
shipbuilding operations, adding more new projects with high
front-end costs as opposed to ongoing projects that improve cash
flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our efforts are focused on building a foundation to
accelerate growth in sales earnings and cash flow,'' said Litton
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Michael R. Brown in a
Wednesday morning conference call to investors.
</P>
<P>
   Litton shares fell 81.25 cents to close at $41.25 on heavy
volume of 2.23 million shares.

   ``The market is just unavailing of any shortcomings these
days,'' said Meagher.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lleyton Hewitt is heir to what was expected to be
Andre Agassi's easy quarter of the draw, but those who think the
flashy Australian teenager is the lesser player should give it some
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt defeated Arnaud Clement, the man who blitzed Agassi in
straight sets in the second round, 6-2, 6-4, 6-3 Wednesday to
become the first man to qualify for the semifinals of the U.S.
Open.
</P>
<P>
   The ninth-seeded Hewitt, who calls himself ``Rock'' because he's
inspired by the Rocky movies, has won four titles this year, tied
for first on the ATP Tour. He's lost only one set here in five
matches.

   ``As soon as I got in the top 10, I think I really started to
believe that I should be there,'' said Hewitt, the youngest top-10
player. ``I want to cement my spot in the top 10 among these guys.
This is just another step in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, at 19 years, 4 months, is the youngest men's
semifinalist here since Pete Sampras in 1990. That was the year
Sampras first won it.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Hewitt became the youngest winner at the
Queen's grass court tournament since Boris Becker when he beat
Sampras in the final.
</P>
<P>
   At 5-foot-11, 148 pounds, Hewitt is one of the tour's quickest
and most spirited players, and he showed Clement a good stick from
the service line, hitting a career-high 18 aces, including eight in
his first four service games.
</P>
<P>
   One of the questions in Hewitt's game has been whether he could
hurt his opponents with more than just his speed and steady
groundstrokes. Hewitt didn't have to do much more than that against
Clement, who wasn't sharp in his first quarterfinal at a Grand
Slam.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't make any mistakes, just put the ball on the court,
and me, I made lots of mistakes,'' Clement said. ``That's it. He
can play better than today.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, supported by a vocal group of flag-waving Australian
fans known as the Fanatics, faces the winner of Wednesday's late
match between Pete Sampras and Richard Krajicek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I'm going to have a few nerves the morning of the
match and that,'' Hewitt said. ``But I like being out there trying
to put on a show for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The final two men's quarters _ Todd Martin vs. Thomas Johansson
and No. 6 Marat Safin vs. No. 14 Nicolas Kiefer _ will be today.
The semifinals begin at 11 a.m. Saturday, and the men's final will
be at 4 p.m. Sunday.

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ President Clinton opened the summit meeting of
world leaders at the United Nations on Wednesday, urging the huge
gathering to prepare the institution for a new age in which
international forces will have to reach regularly and rapidly
inside national boundaries to protect threatened people.
</P>
<P>
   With his own time in the front rank of the 149 world leaders
gathered here drawing to an end, Clinton also used the moment to
try to settle some of the disputes that have dogged his presidency,
from the Middle East to Russia to Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The president met separately into the evening with Prime
Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and then with the Palestinian leader,
Yasser Arafat, in hopes of picking up the broken pieces of the
peace agreement that came tantalizingly close at Camp David in
July. Clinton warned that ``like all life's chances,'' the moment
for an accord ``is fleeting and about to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, the White House spokes- man, Joe Lockhart, gave
no indica- tion that the meetings had resulted in any progress on
the question of con- trol of Jerusalem or other issues dividing
Arafat and Barak. But Lockhart indicated that the White House was
reimposing the news blackout that surrounded the Camp David talks,
and said that as of now no meetings were scheduled this week among
the three leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sparred anew with Russia's president, Vladimir Putin,
who is using the gathering here to propose a ban on military uses
of space, another effort to terminate U.S. efforts to develop a
national missile defense. Clinton's aides gave Putin a summary of
U.S. intelligence gathered during the Kursk submarine disaster,
which suggests that Putin's own naval forces may have misled him in
the days after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was deliberately vague on the question of when the
United Nations should step into civil wars or ethnic and religious
disputes _ an argument that has come up repeatedly during his
presidency. ``These conflicts present us with a stark challenge,''
he said. ``Are they part of the scourge the U.N. was established to
prevent? If so, we must respect sovereignty and territorial
integrity, but still find a way to protect people as well as
borders.''
</P>
<P>
   Just hours before he spoke, three U.N. relief workers were
killed in West Timor, apparently by Indonesian militia forces. The
news, underscoring the risks to U.N. workers as they insert
themselves into uncontrolled disputes, put a chill on the opening
ceremony. As the session began, the U.N. secretary-general, Kofi
Annan, called for a minute of silence to remember the three
international aid workers, as Indonesia's president, Abdurrahman
Wahid, struggling with a clear erosion of his authority at home,
sat in the hall.
</P>
<P>
   With the East Side of Manhattan at a near standstill while a
parade of prime ministers and presidents zoomed through the police
lines, Clinton clearly relished one of his last hurrah's as
president in front of what the United Nations called the largest
gathering of world leaders in history. Rarely has he had a chance
to talk to both adversaries and allies at the same moment, a group
as diverse as President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea and President
Fidel Castro of Cuba, who listened to Clinton but never got close
enough to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stayed in the hall after his speech and, because of an
unexpected change in the order of speakers, heard President
Mohammad Khatami of Iran, with whom the United States still has no
formal dialogue, talk about the clash of Islamic and Western
cultures.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright sat
listening at the back of the huge hall, Khatami declared that in
coming years the world could no longer be ruled by ``monopolies of
power and capital,'' a clear reference to the United States. It was
one of a series of expressions of frustration about America's
global power that emerged as a subtext of the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Clinton spoke of the need to intervene strongly
when a nation's leaders abuse their own people, the president of
China, Jiang Zemin, described a very different concept of how the
world should operate. ``Respect for each other's independence and
sovereignty is vital to the maintenance of world peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Striking a theme often heard from Chinese leaders who fear that
intervention in Kosovo or East Timor could provide the precedent
for one day intervening in Tibet or Taiwan, Jiang added: ``Dialogue
and cooperation in the field of human rights must be conduucted on
the basis of respect for state sovereignty. Without sovereignty,
there will be no human rights to speak of.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of the growing suspicions about America's use of
that power _ or perhaps because of the constant conflict between
the United Nations and Washington over the payment of dues to the
organization _ Clinton did not receive the kind of standing ovation
that greeted him in 1998. During his speech, he made an oblique
reference to Washington's $1.7 billion in arrears to the United
Nations, saying that as the organization expands its missions,
``all these things come with a price tag, and all nations,
including the United States, must pay it.''
</P>
<P>
   He also took a clear shot at conservative Republicans who have
attacked the United Nations, saying, ``Those in my country or
elsewhere who believe we can do without the United Nations, or
impose our will upon it, misread history and misunderstand the
future.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Clinton spoke, he met in the U.N. building with
the president of Vietnam, Tan Duc Luong. He reassured him that a
recent trade accord between the United States and Vietnam would
remain a top priority for the United States, even though he has
decided not to try to win approval of the agreement from Congress
this year. The two men also discussed Clinton's desire to visit
Vietnam before the end of his presidency, which would make him the
first U.S. president to set foot on Vietnamese soil since the end
of the war nearly 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   While the White House made no announcement of such plans, senior
administration officials say that Clinton is likely to visit
Vietnam just before Thanksgiving. He is planning to attend the
annual Asian economic summit in Brunei, and would make a symbolic _
and highly emotional _ visit to Hanoi on the same trip.
</P>
<P>
   Such individual meetings and initiatives always dominate the
opening of the U.N. session in September. But the stated purpose of
this vast summit meeting of leaders is much broader: to set new
priorities and directions for the United Nations, which at age 55
seems creaky and unprepared for a host of new challenges.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the leaders are scheduled to sign a millennium
declaration, calling for a new peacekeeping structure _ a report to
Annan calls for a strengthened corps of commanders in New York,
ready to organize peacekeeping operations in a week or two. It also
sets goals for reducing poverty and illiteracy during the next 15
years, and contains carefully crafted language about guiding
economic globalization so that it benefits the poor as much as the
rich, and small, uncompetitive nations as much as the developed
world.
</P>
<P>
   But as with any document that is signed by so many, the language
is so watered down that discerning its specific meaning is
difficult at best. And it is particularly difficult to pin down the
United Nations' role in managing economic globalization and
development. More and more, that role has fallen to the
institutions that were created at the end of World War II to manage
the world economy _ the World Bank, which focuses on poverty, and
the International Monetary Fund, which seeks to prevent and manage
economic crises.
</P>
<P>
   Their growing role leaves the United Nations increasingly on the
sidelines when it comes to the crucial questions of economic
development _ who gets capital and under what conditions _ and even
their efforts are frequently overshadowed by the billions in
private capital that now slosh through the emerging markets on a
daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   In such an environment, the United Nations' role is chiefly
hortatory. And because the United Nations does not impose the kind
of conditions on its aid that the World Bank and IMF require, from
fiscal prudence to Western-style accounting methods _ it has become
the forum in which many nations want to move the debate over the
rules of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   This has been evident all week on the streets near the United
Nations. There have been globalization teach-ins, and constant talk
inside the United Nations about the growing inequality between rich
and poor nations. But the protests on the streets have been pale
compared to those that rocked the Seattle meeting of the World
Trade Organization late last year, and even those who came here to
make their case were largely drowned out Thursday by the
motorcades, the speeches and the massive security operation.

`WHO'S BEEN EATING MY FOOD?' COLORADANS ASK, AS BEARS FORAGE CLOSER
TO HOMES 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BASALT, Colo. _ It was bad enough when Steve Solomon and his
wife, Bates, found the skunk crawling around under their bed at 2
a.m. That they could deal with. Sooner or later, Solomon figured,
the critter would make its way out the front door, which they
routinely left open for the breeze. But was the door still open?
Solomon had to check.
</P>
<P>
   That's when he froze. It was open, all right. But standing only
20 feet away at the compost bin was a large black bear, chomping on
the remains of a cantaloupe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must have been twice my size,'' Solomon said Wednesday,
guessing the bear's weight at 400 pounds or more. ``I had a skunk
behind me, a bear in front of me. I didn't know which one was
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon is hardly the only Coloradan who of late has lived out a
Goldilocks tale in reverse. Because of a hot, dry summer that has
withered natural food supplies, and with an ever increasing number
of people living closer to forests and wilderness areas, bears have
been meeting up with humans at an alarming rate throughout the
state.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only a smattering of human injuries have been reported,
all of them minor. The encounters have been worse on the bears,
more than 25 of which have been put to death this year under
Colorado's two-strikes-and-you're-out policy for those that forage
too close to people. Over the same period last year, the state
killed only six.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists and state officials say that if there are more
summers like this one, and if home construction near mountainous
areas continues at its feverish pace, more dangerous confrontations
are inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a bear learns where to find human foods, he's likely to
come back,'' said Chuck Schwartz, an expert in bears as the leader
of the United States Geological Survey's Interagency Grizzly Bear
Study Team, in Bozeman, Mont. ``They have very good memory, and
they don't differentiate. If it's edible, they'll eat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Grizzlies are not to be confused with the black bears roaming
Colorado and other states. Grizzlies, larger than black bears and
more threatening to humans, are generally found only in areas
around two national parks in the northwest Rockies, Yellowstone and
Glacier, putting them at greater distances from population centers.
</P>
<P>
   Black bears, which are known to attack humans only when they
feel trapped, are commonly found in dense forests and mountain
terrain at high elevations, where they have encountered unsuitable
conditions in Colorado this year. A late spring frost and endless
summer weeks of uncommonly hot and dry weather have cost them their
usual meals of acorns and berries.
</P>
<P>
   Bears typically eat up to 20 hours a day in the warm months to
put on enough weight to last the winter. Denied their natural
foods, they have been foraging closer to homes and towns to
scavenge landfills, trash cans, even dog dishes, making this year
one of the most active for officials responding to calls from
frightened people throughout the Rocky Mountain West. In Colorado,
reports of bear sightings and encounters now occur almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has a bear story,'' said Solomon, a jewelry maker
who has lived for 15 years in Basalt (pronounced buh-SALT), a
mountain town 20 miles northwest of Aspen. ``One woman on the next
street down was canning in her kitchen with the door open. A bear
wandered in to help her out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know another family,'' he said, ``who eliminated every bit
of food from their house, scrubbed it down and now only eats in
restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   In Aspen, the food is apparently so tasty that for the first
time bears have been spotted poking into garbage bins along Main
Street this year. Other bears have wandered along streets in Grand
Junction. Tom Theobald, a beekeeper near Boulder, said bears had
twice ravaged his colonies, eating the honey and destroying
equipment at a cost that now exceeds $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how they do it,'' he said of the bears'
marauding. ``They must be taking an awful lot of stings.''
</P>
<P>
   Most encounters this summer have ended peacefully, but some have
taken their toll on the bears, especially those that officials have
previously encountered, tranquilized and tagged. Any tagged bear
that returns to where people live is put to death under the state
program if it can be caught. In addition, property owners have a
right to shoot a bear that is threatening human life.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Colorado Department of Wildlife, 74 black bears
were killed in those two ways through Aug. 31, and the number is
climbing so rapidly that officials say this year could easily
become the worst for the bears in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Towns like Aspen and Snowmass Village, near bear habitat, are
taking steps to discourage the scavenging by requiring residents to
upgrade garbage receptacles and bringing misdemeanor charges
against those who do not comply.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Basalt, Solomon has begun storing his trash elsewhere.
For the first time since he moved in all those years ago, he is
locking his front door at night.

5 TEENS ACCUSED OF KILLING FOOD DELIVERYMAN TO AVOID PAYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS with additional details and more background; story grows by
about 800 words and is now 2 takes; single byline becomes double
byline)  
 By DAVID BARSTOW and SARAH KERSHAW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It looked at first like a botched robbery: the owner
of a Chinese takeout place was lured late Friday night to a dark
dead-end street in Queens, where he was jumped and bludgeoned to
death. The killers left him with $600.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators said Wednesday that the real motive was
heartbreakingly mundane: he had been killed by a group of
teen-agers who wanted a free meal.
</P>
<P>
   The five teen-agers, who were all under arrest Wednesday and
scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday night, had no criminal records
and were mostly from solidly middle-class families. Prosecutors
said they were hungry and wanted to eat without paying, so they
used a cell phone to call in their $60 order _ General Tso's
chicken, shrimp egg foo yong, chicken with broccoli and shrimp lo
mein _ to a vacant house on 176th Street in Springfield Gardens,
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   When the deliveryman, Jin-Sheng Liu, 44, arrived shortly before
midnight, he was jumped from behind, covered with a bedsheet and
pummeled to death with repeated head blows from fists and at least
one brick. As police officers converged on the scene, the group _
four boys and a girl, none older than 17 _ fled with a bag of food
to one of the boys' homes to eat, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of days, police, who cracked the case by tracing the
call to the restaurant on the cell phone, began zeroing in on a
group of teen-agers who lived in the neighborhood around the vacant
house at 130-19 176th St. The youngest, a skinny 14-year-old karate
enthusiast named Robert Savage, was arrested Tuesday as he was
riding his bicycle outside his parents' neatly kept home in
Springfield Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   It was Savage, investigators said, who struck the most serious
blows, smashing the skull of Liu with a brick. Liu, the owner of
the Golden Wok at 192-15 Linden Boulevard in St. Albans, Queens,
was pronounced dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just did something, and it turned out ugly,'' said Robert
Eilam, 20, who lives across the street from Savage. Eilam said that
on Tuesday afternoon, a few hours before Savage was arrested, the
boy had started to cry for no apparent reason. ``He was just acting
as if he were so sorry about something,'' Eilam said.
</P>
<P>
   Savage and the other teen-agers are being prosecuted as adults.
Each faces multiple charges of second-degree murder, robbery and
criminal possession of a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a terribly tragic case,'' said Richard A. Brown, the
Queens district attorney, said at a news conference Wednesday.
``Mr. Liu was a hard-working immigrant who leaves behind a wife and
two children. He was killed without provocation and without reason.
It was a shocking crime, which leaves us all shaking our heads and
wondering why these kids would do what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities identified the other teen-agers as James Stone,
16, of 176-31 130th Ave.; Jamel Murphy, 17, of 219-05 131st Ave.;
Darryl Tyson, 17, of 132-07 178th St.; and Stacy Royster, 17, of
257-52 148th Drive. Because of his age, Savage faces a maximum
sentence of nine years to life in prison, prosecutors said. The
other four face up to 25 years to life.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of Savage, Stone and Tyson either would not comment or
did not respond to messages left at their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family just wants their son home _ that's it,'' said a man
sitting on the front steps of James Stone's home, five doors down
from Robert Savage's home.
</P>
<P>
   A man who would not give his name but identified himself as the
father of Jamel Murphy trembled during a brief interview Wednesday
in front of his house. ``I really don't have any words to describe
how I feel right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he planned to attend his son's arraignment, he replied:
``I'm not going to go, no. For me to go and show support for
something I don't support would be hypocritical.''
</P>
<P>
   Royster's grandmother, Anastasia Brown, said in an interview
Wednesday that her granddaughter had struggled in recent years with
mental illness that at times made her ``aggressive and out of
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who raised Royster after the girl's mother died about
eight years ago, said that in recent months Royster had seemed to
get her life back on track. Only last week, Brown said, she signed
up for classes at Queensborough Community College.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Investigators described Liu's death as the senseless outcome of
an amateurish scheme. The group had already eaten once on Friday
from another Chinese restaurant, but they decided they wanted
seconds. Only this time, they came up with a plan to avoid paying,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, officials said they told the police, was for Royster
to call the Golden Wok with her cell phone and place an order.
Then, investigators said, Royster was to wait on the front steps of
the vacant house, ideally situated for a robbery across a dead-end
street from thick woods. The teen-agers later told investigators
that they chose Royster to place the order and wait for the
delivery because they figured that she would be perceived as less
of a potential threat, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   When the delivery man arrived, the idea was for the boys to jump
out of hiding places in the bushes by the front door, cover him
with the sheet and then flee with the food, investigators said. But
they also were armed with a couple of bricks taken from one of
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   According to the authorities, the plan unfolded as planned about
11 p.m. on Friday when Royster called the Golden Wok. Royster
barely knew most of the boys. She had become involved with the
group through her friendship with Tyson, whom she had known from
high school. She keeps a photograph of Tyson by her bedroom mirror,
not far from her posters of Snoop Doggy Dog and Mariah Carey and
her collection of stuffed animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't find a nicer guy,'' Brown said of Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   According to her grandmother, Royster had been at home much of
Friday, listening to CDs _ hip hop and Spanish music _ writing
e-mail messages, watching television. About 5 p.m. she told her
grandmother she was going over to Tyson's house, in Springfield
Gardens several miles away, and said she would not be out late.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said that about 9 p.m., she beeped her granddaughter, who
called her back on the cell phone Brown had bought for her a few
months ago. Brown said she told her not to stay out late, but
Royster did not come home until about 2 a.m., and she was agitated
and nervous, staying up until 3:30 a.m. and acting strange ``and
hyper'' the rest of the weekend. She told her grandmother over the
weekend that she had lost her cell phone, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Liu was already dead. Plans for a simple robbery of
food had spiraled out of control, investigators said, when Robert
Savage used one of the bricks to begin hitting Liu. An autopsy
found that he had been struck in the skull at least three times.
</P>
<P>
   Liu had operated the Golden Wok for at least 10 years. It is a
modest storefront operation. There are no tables for dining, and
Liu, a Chinese immigrant who spoke little English, made most of the
deliveries himself. He worked long days side by side with his wife,
a son and a daughter, and they lived in an apartment fashioned from
partitions and bunk beds at the rear of the restaurant, said the
former property manager for the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Golden Wok remained closed and the Liu family
remained in seclusion. ``He was an asset to the community,'' said
Morris Greene, owner of a realty company a few doors down from the
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   In the days after Liu's death, the teen-agers carried on as if
all were normal. They went to a nearby mall. They rode their
bicycles in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Royster went to her first day of classes at
Queensborough, and while she was at the college a detective showed
up at the house with questions about a call placed to the
restaurant from a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   According to Brown, she quickly admitted to calling the
restaurant and then described the attack. Several people who live
in the neighborhood said Royster also returned there and helped
point out some of her alleged accomplices to detectives.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said her granddaughter told detectives that she and Tyson
had waited on the steps, with the other boys in the bushes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stacy had nothing to do with that man being killed,'' Brown
said, beginning to cry. ``She's not involved in anything like
that.''

</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Friday, September
1 about the finances of Dick Cheney, the Republican candidate for
vice president, misstated his reason for having rejected $89,500 in
honorariums from 1992 to 1999 and having directed them to charity.
The action was voluntary, not required.
</P>
<P>
   The article also misstated the relationship of Cheney's wife,
Lynne, to the board of Union Pacific Resources. She was a board
member until the company was taken over this year by the Anadarko
Petroleum Corp., an independent oil and gas exploration company.
She is not now a member.

TURKISH POLICE BAR GAY AMERICANS FROM VISITING AEGEAN PORT 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Turkish police Wednesday barred several hundred
gay Americans from visiting tourist sites near an Aegean port,
Kusadasi, and ordered them back aboard their cruise ship, prompting
complaints from the State Department, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the tourists, who are on what travel operators say is
the largest gay cruise to visit Turkey, were rounded up from
locations ashore, ordered to board their buses and escorted by the
police back to the ship, according to State Department and White
House officials, as well as people who spoke with passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Other passengers were prevented from leaving the area where
their ship, the Olympic Voyager, was docked. About 800 gay tourists
are on the cruise.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats protested to the Turkish Foreign Ministry and
raised the concern that the Americans were being mistreated because
of their sexual orientation. ``We asked that the tourists be
allowed to continue their tour of Turkey unencumbered,'' said
Philip Reeker, a spokesman for the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Although Reeker said the facts surrounding the incident were
sketchy, he confirmed the police actions. ``Obviously,'' he said,
``we're dismayed at the actions. That's why we contacted the
Turkish officials.''
</P>
<P>
   The tour operator decided to continue the cruise, which is
scheduled to reach Istanbul on Thursday. The State Department has
asked the U.S. consul general to meet the travelers and to help
ensure that there are no further problems, Reeker said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Turkish Embassy in Washington, Sensu
Yemisci, said she did not have specific information about the
incident. But she disputed a suggestion that Turks were not
tolerant of gays and noted that the beach resort of Bodrum, not far
from Kusadasi, also near Samos, was popular among homosexual
tourists. She called the allegations of police bias absurd.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are hundreds of thousands of gays in Turkey,'' Yemisci
said. ``Probably, ordinary people don't like it very much. But it
doesn't make any difference.''
</P>
<P>
   David Mixner, a gay Democratic Party campaigner who spoke by
telephone with the tour organizer in Turkey, said the Turkish
police had told the tourists that they were not allowed ashore
because of their homosexuality. Mixner said he spoke with Rich
Campbell of Atlantis Events, the operator, which has its
headquarters in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were not allowed off the ship because they were gay,''
Mixner said. ``This was not a secret. There was no issue other than
that. There was no inappropriate behavior or confrontation. They
were tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   The weeklong luxury cruise was to include stops to see the
Parthenon in Greece, the Pyramids in Egypt and Israeli holy sites.
In promotional material, Atlantis, the largest American tour
operator that caters to gays, described the trip as ``unlike any
Atlantis has ever offered.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident was the third time that Atlantis has faced a
significant confrontation abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Cayman Islands, a Caribbean destination renowned
for its scuba diving, notified Atlantis that it would not allow its
cruise ship to dock. The tour was rerouted to Belize.
</P>
<P>
   Also that year, members of an Atlantis group faced small public
protests in Costa Rica. Government officials subsequently
apologized, Atlantis officials said.

SCHOOL BOARD, FACING SUIT, AGREES TO RECOGNIZE GAY CLUB 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Calif., Utah)  By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A suburban Los Angeles school district has reached
an agreement to recognize a group of gay students and their
supporters. The decision would settle a federal lawsuit challenging
the district's refusal to allow it to meet as a student club.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange Unified Board of Education in Orange is expected to
complete the agreement on Thursday to allow the meetings at El
Modena High School, which had been taking place under court order
since February. The planned settlement comes after the Salt Lake
City School District in Utah voted on Tuesday to end a four-year
ban on noncurricular clubs that had been instituted after a gay
tolerance group tried to form at a high school there. Salt Lake
schools had also been sued over their ban.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange board approved the settlement by a 5-2 vote at a
closed session in August. On Thursday, the board plans to adopt
changes in policies involving clubs that will allow the agreement
to take effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``This settlement agreement would allow us to bring this to
closure and move ahead with the business of the district, which is
offering quality education to the children of Orange Unified,''
said Judy Frutig, director of communications for the district.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the parallel decisions in Orange and Salt Lake
City, Jon W. Davidson, a supervising lawyer with the Lambda Legal
Defense and Education Fund, which represented students in both
districts, said, ``I think the message of both of these districts
is it's a losing battle for school districts to try and prevent
students from forming the clubs they want, including gay-straight
alliances.''
</P>
<P>
   In voting last year to deny the Gay-Straight Alliance's
application to meet, the Orange board cited the state education
code, which it said strictly defined how sex education and related
courses were to be taught. The board maintained that it would be
inappropriate for students to lead discussions on sexuality and
sexual conduct.
</P>
<P>
   A federal lawsuit filed in behalf of the club and a student
organizer, Anthony Colin, accused the district of violating the
Equal Access Act, a federal law prohibiting schools from
selectively denying noncurricular clubs on the basis of content.
The suit also contended that the board's denial violated students'
constitutional rights to free speech and equal protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have basically won, no matter what's said,'' Colin said.
``The gay and lesbian community now knows the board has made the
right decision to welcome this club onto their campus. It sets a
precedent for organizations all over the country, California and
the rest of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson of the legal defense fund said it remained uncertain
whether the change in Salt Lake City would mean that the
gay-straight alliance would be allowed to meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lawyers for the school district have suggested that it
would,'' he said. ``However, there are a number of requirements in
policy they adopted that we find troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those were stipulations that any club can be denied
authorization if it advocated or approved of sexual activity
outside marriage or violated state laws regarding sex education.
The policy also stipulates that the district can disapprove club
names and requires parental consent for membership in clubs.
</P>
<P>
   John Robson, a lawyer representing the Salt Lake City School
District, said he expected that the lifting of the ban on
noncurricular clubs would result in a gay-straight alliance being
allowed to meet.
</P>
<P>
   In Orange, the board stopped short of banning all noncurricular
clubs in February following a preliminary injunction ordering the
district to allow the Gay-Straight Alliance, which had about 50
members, to meet at El Modena High School. Instead, the board voted
to restrict clubs at elementary and middle schools to those related
to studies.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement announced on Tuesday, Orange Unified will
continue to allow the group to meet, but will change some rules
regarding noncurricular clubs. The new rules will include a
restriction on discussions of sexual activities and will provide
parents with an opportunity to prevent their children from
participating in specified clubs.

RAMPAGING MOB IN WEST TIMOR KILLS THREE U.N. AID WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs for rewriting thruout) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A mob led by militiamen brandishing automatic
rifles and homemade firearms attacked a U.N. refugee office in West
Timor Wednesday, killing three staff members: one from Puerto Rico,
one from Ethiopia and one from Croatia..
</P>
<P>
   A fourth may have also been killed, according to a U.N.
statement later, but no details were provided.
</P>
<P>
   The attack prompted outrage halfway around the world at a
meeting of world leaders here.
</P>
<P>
   The 149 leaders included Indonesia's president, Abdurrahman
Wahid, who, embarrassed by the failure of his army and police based
on the troubled island to prevent the rampage, attributed it on
grieving supporters of a local militia leader who died under
mysterious circumstances on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid promised to send two battalions of troops to reassert
control, but it did not placate the fury at the United Nations,
which has seen 193 of its peacekeepers and civilian workers serving
there killed since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who was to have met with Wahid
later this week, instead confronted him at a meeting Wednesday.
Annan condemned the attack and told Wahid that the security
situation in West Timor was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, addressing the opening of the summit meeting, Annan
said: ``This tragedy underlines once again the dangers faced by
unarmed humanitarian workers serving the United Nations in conflict
or post-conflict situations. The Security Council, and I myself,
have repeatedly expressed concern about the safety of United
Nations personnel in the field, both military and civilian.''
</P>
<P>
   The refugee agency identified the dead as Carlos Caceres-Collazo
from Puerto Rico, Sampson Areghegn from Ethiopia and Pero Simundza
from Croatia. A statement issued later by the Security Council
referred to the possible death of a fourth international aid
worker, but did not give any details.
</P>
<P>
   The council was briefed on the attack by Bernard Miyet, the head
of U.N. peacekeeping operations, and Sadako Ogata, the U.N. high
commissioner for refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Ogata read to the council an e-mail message that Caceres-Collazo
had tapped out shortly before he was killed. According to a
diplomat present, it said in part:
</P>
<P>
   ``You should see this office. Plywood on the windows, staff
peering out through openings in the curtains hastily installed a
few minutes ago. We are waiting for this enemy. We sit here like
bait, unarmed, waiting for wave to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am glad to be leaving this island for three weeks,''
Caceres-Collazo wrote. ``I just hope I will be able to leave
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Ogata ordered the evacuation of the refugee agency's workers in
West Timor, in effect suspending aid to more than 100,000 refugees
in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Barely suppressing her anger at a briefing for journalists, she
called the rampage the worst security incident that her office had
witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   Ogata said she protested the attack in ``an encounter'' with
Wahid on Wednesday. She reported that he had expressed feelings of
mourning for the slain refugee workers, and had told her that one
of the two promised battalions was already on its way to West
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But after the meeting, Ogata said: ``I would like to insist that
the president of Indonesia implement security measures. Words are
not enough anymore. I want facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Violence has ravaged the divided island of Timor since last
year, when militias opposed to independence from Indonesia attacked
residents of East Timor who had voted for secession, killing or
wounding many of them and razing some villages. Nearly 300,000 East
Timorese fled for safety to the western part of the island. An
estimated 170,000 of the refugees have since returned home, but up
to 125,000 remain in West Timor, where militias have continued to
prey on them, despite appeals by the United Nations and others for
the Indonesian government to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something that happened all of a sudden,'' Ogata said
of Wednesday's rampage. ``It's just expressed in the worst possible
way.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ogata's staff, the attack on the refugee office in
the impoverished town of Atambua was prompted by a funeral for
Olivio Mendonca, a militia leader also known as Moruk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man killed was the head of one of the most notorious and
criminal militia groups of East Timor,'' Caceres-Collazo wrote in
his e-mail: ``These guys act without thinking and can kill a human
as easily (and painlessly) as I kill mosquitoes in my room.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, dozens of militants from the funeral
procession of more than 1,000 mourners stormed the refugee office,
beat Caceres-Collazo and his two colleagues to death, set fire to
their vehicles and stole equipment, including radios needed for
contact with other U.N. offices on the island.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said the refugee agency suspended operations for
six days in West Timor last month after several employees were
stoned and attacked with machetes, but resumed work following
assurances of security from the Indonesian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday evening, 14 U.N. employees and 30 workers for other
relief organizations, including some local employees in Atambua,
were evacuated out by helicopter and flown to Dili, the capital of
East Timor. Others were reported still hiding from the mob.
</P>
<P>
   Frederic Eckhard, the secretary-general's spokesman, declined to
give details to avoid putting their lives at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has more than 8,000 military peacekeepers
deployed in East Timor, but their mandate restricts them to
providing security and supporting reconstruction in that territory
in preparation for formal independence from Indonesia, probably
next year. Two peacekeepers were killed in a clash with militiamen
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Ogata said her agency's employees still in West Timor, including
about 50 in its capital, Kupang, would be evacuated on Thursday,
and would not go back until their security was guaranteed.

GORE DRILLS FICK WITH BATTING-PRACTICE PITCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Presidential candidate Al Gore made a campaign stop at
Comerica Park on Wednesday, throwing batting practice to the
Detroit Tigers for about five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   He hit Tigers infielder and Cal State Northridge product Robert
Fick with a pitch on the hip but otherwise threw strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw good,'' said pitcher Tim Belcher, who was one of four
Anaheim Angels players to shake hands with Gore. ``If he's elected,
I will have shaken hands with the last four presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher said he met Ronald Reagan at the White House after the
Dodgers won the World Series in 1988 and also met George Bush and
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made it a point to visit the Angels' dugout before the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``His briefing coordinator told us he told Gore, `Get a picture
with the Angels, California's a swing state,' '' Belcher said.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers Jarrod Washburn, Ramon Ortiz and Seth Etherton also met
Gore while dozens of Secret Service agents swarmed the field.
</P>
<P>
   __ Belcher needed: Belcher has spent more time on the disabled
list than on the mound during his two seasons with the Angels but
will try to make a contribution at a time the Angels need it most.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher, who has made only four starts this year after
recovering from offseason elbow surgery, will start tonight against
Detroit. It will be his first start since July 2 and comes at a
time when the starters are reeling: Going into Wednesday's game, no
starter had won since Matt Wise beat the Indians on Aug. 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the youth in the rotation, I feel I can be a nice
addition, provided I can pitch well,'' Belcher said. ``If I don't
pitch well, it doesn't matter. . . . What we need is not going to
center around the addition or subtraction of one player. You'd like
to think I can help the team in the next four weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher won his first two starts this season before his elbow
began to flare up. His next two were horrible and he landed back on
the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the club holds an option to bring Belcher back next
season for $5.1 million, it's more likely they will buy him out for
$1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just thinking about Thursday,'' Belcher said when asked
about next season. ``I just want to get through the last month, be
productive and healthy and I'll think about next year after that. I
can't lie and say I don't think about it, but I don't want to talk
about it and make it an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Batting optional: The Angels did not take batting practice on
the field or infield practice Wednesday. Some players hit in the
underground batting cage, but it was optional.
</P>
<P>
   It was manager Mike Scioscia's way of trying to help his players
relax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely sense the dog days, see the guys trying too hard
as opposed to letting it happen,'' Scioscia said. ``It's also a way
to save some energy. It gives them a little more time to relax and
keep them in a good frame of mind.''

COUPLES FOUND AT LOST CANYON

<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. _ Boom Boom always knew how to pick his
spots.
</P>
<P>
   If that huge chunk of the calendar between January and October
proved unkind, the short days of late autumn and early winter
beckoned. Health permitting, he's always an A-list invitee to those
lucrative limited-field events after all the year's official
record-keeping is complete but the bank account isn't.
</P>
<P>
   He has understated flair in abundance, once finding a patch of
Velcro on a slippery Augusta National slope during the 1992 Masters
and career opportunities everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Now Fred Couples, one of the sport's most popular practitioners,
sees a big one in the city known as Coptown, USA. He's putting up a
big chunk of his money, as well as his name, on the proposition
that Simi Valley will also become known as a premier golf
destination.
</P>
<P>
   It could be a new career in the making, too.
</P>
<P>
   Couples is the ``course consultant'' at Lost Canyons, the new
36-hole complex being molded into the wilds at the north end of
Tapo Canyon Road. It is a Pete Dye project, but there is a little
bit of Couples in it, too.

   Of course, not many will be able to play either of the 18-hole
layouts like Couples.
</P>
<P>
   Dye asked him some pointed questions that would indicate trouble
for the recreational players who will pay more than $100 a round to
test their games. For example, does Couples like 480-yard holes
uphill into the wind, and tough par 3s? The theory is longer is
better.
</P>
<P>
   And we all know Boom-Boom has no problem with length. But that
is from the professional's perspective. Couples says the complex
will also suit the recreational player. The course will show them
the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``What (Dye) is trying to make you do is to go in a direction
where it is safe and if you hit a really horrible shot, you are
going to pay the price,'' Couples said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fairways look narrower, especially with the mountains on the
Shadow Course, but you can hit a really horrible shot and kick it
back into play.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples is known for his relaxed demeanor, but he is also a
smart businessman, evident by his Cadillac-sponsorship deal. And he
associates himself with winners.
</P>
<P>
   So it is with Dye.
</P>
<P>
   For Couples, this association is like being atop the leaderboard
at the end of Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking at being able to work with Pete Dye, who I
think is the world's number-one designer,'' Couples said on a
recent tour of Lost Canyons, which is scheduled to open in
November. ``Right now I couldn't be any more thrilled to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   His main contribution will be deciding how the course should be
played and then passing that knowledge on to the forecaddies, who
will lead players around. And he can't wait to play Lost Canyons,
especially since Dye has already said it will rank among his most
notable projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Pete, I feel like I've been thrown in there with a great
starting quarterback like Steve Young or Joe Montana. He just asked
me a bunch of questions and that is how we got to this point.
Basically, Pete designed this and I've just had real quick input on
it,'' Couples said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he's done here is build a remarkable golf course with
some really incredible views.''
</P>
<P>
   This might turn out to be a new career for Couples, but there is
some unfinished businesses on the regular tour.
</P>
<P>
   The season is pretty much over except for the postseason events,
which will include Couples' appearance in the annual Skins Game.
</P>
<P>
   He is already looking ahead to next year and his goal is to once
again get in the winner's circle _ where the money is official.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, Couples has played 17 events and won $889,915.
His last win came at the 1998 Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, which
makes the competitive juices flow a little quicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like doing this, but I still want to pay attention to what I
am doing golf-wise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That will involve practice, some of which will be done be done
at Los Canyons after the facility opens. Once again Boom Boom
thinks he found a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this place is a gold mine. And I've put my money on
it,''
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: Though it's not open, Lost Canyons is in the running
to take over as host of the LPGA stop in Greater Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Robert B. Collins, vice president of Group Dynamics, one of the
tournament's organizers, joined Couples on a tour of the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Five courses are under consideration: two in the Ventura County
area, two in the eastern portion of Los Angeles and one in Orange
County, Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to narrow the choice to two by month's end. The final
choice rests with the LPGA. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Meg Mackenzie, Lost Canyons' director of sales and marketing,
said the course is sold out for the opening week. Two tournaments
have also been booked.

 &HT;    A FLAWED FATHER'S PERFECT SON(a)

<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - It took guts to pick up the telephone and dial. The
phone number is at the bottom of the newspaper column, inviting
people - almost daring them - to call. But he had to figure the guy
on the other end of the line is most likely what George W. Bush
would call a ``major league (expletive).''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he called.
</P>
<P>
   The column was about his father, and it troubled him. He's 19
years old, trying to get through a very tough college and having to
deal with the fact that his dad is locked up in a federal
penitentiary. Now along comes this writer saying things about his
old man he just can't accept or go along with.
</P>
<P>
   He loves and admires his dad. He always has, even during the
many years his father lived a lie, calling himself Gary Tredway and
pretending he wasn't a fugitive named Howard Mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   The writer doesn't admire Mechanic much. At least he doesn't
admire the fact that Mechanic chose to run.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tough time. Mechanic had been tried and convicted of
tossing a cherry bomb during a student demonstration in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence against him was shaky at best, and the sentence he
received, five years in prison, was outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he'd made choices based on his convictions. He'd assumed
risks. And when the time came to pay the consequences, he ran,
changing his name and living a fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Five years in federal prison seems like a terrible price to pay
for your convictions. Then again, it seems a lot easier than the 5
1/2 years the future Sen. John McCain spent in North Vietnam's
Hanoi Hilton for the way he exercised (beginitalic)his
(enditalic)convictions.
</P>
<P>
   A man and woman at Washington University in St. Louis put up
their house to bail Mechanic out of jail. He left them holding the
bag.
</P>
<P>
   He says he was young and foolish, only 22. But nothing changed
by the time he turned 32 or 42. Nothing changed until he was
exposed by a reporter at 50, and even then, he didn't want to come
forward with the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's in prison, and there are a lot of people trying to get
him a presidential commutation. They call him a persecuted man and
even a martyr. But he's not. A martyr doesn't run.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanic is only a man serving too much time for too little
crime. Among American prisoners, this hardly makes him unique.
</P>
<P>
   These are the kinds of things the writer said about the
19-year-old's father. The young man could have let them pass,
ignored them, but he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   He called. It's not always wise to telephone a newspaper writer.
A string of quotes from the son of a high-profile newsmaker is
fairly irresistible to a major league expletive like me.
</P>
<P>
   You won't read any here, through.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a flawed father with a son of my own. I figure Howard
Mechanic worries, as we all do, that our flaws will define our
children's future.
</P>
<P>
   They won't with Mechanic's son, about whom his parents should be
very proud.
</P>
<P>
   He is articulate and passionate. He speaks with confidence and
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about what Howard Mechanic's son said, however, but
about what he did.
</P>
<P>
   He was confronted with a difficult and intimidating situation,
and he stood his ground. He didn't run.

THIS GAME PERSONAL FOR MANNING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When UCLA sophomore cornerback Ricky Manning takes
the field Saturday against hometown Fresno State, he'll be carrying
more than the responsibility of being a game captain. He'll be
carrying a chip on his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Manning, a three-year star in baseball and football at Fresno
Edison, believes he's been denigrated by Fresno State coach Pat
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know coach Hill feels some animosity toward me,'' Manning
said. ``He'll say stuff and downtalk my skills. I don't know if he
doesn't like me or what. I'm ready for this game.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this has left Hill dumbfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It amazes me that he'd say that,'' said Hill, who says he's
known Manning for five years. ``If that's the way he feels, I feel
bad about that. I've never gotten into a (war of words) about Ricky
Manning. I'm not going to brownnose him, but I think he's a great
player. He's a humble kid. I've got nothing but good things to say
about him as a player and a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning concedes that Hill has never said anything to him
personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hear things, rumors,'' said Manning, who is close to
about a half-dozen Bulldogs, including former high school teammates
Atnaf Harris, Tierre Sams and Deandre Gilbert. ``He probably says
it to get his players going. I know he wants to beat me. If I make
a play, they're going to come right back at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning, one of the best players to come out of Fresno in years,
told Hill early in the recruiting process that he was going to
leave town for college. ``Very rarely will a kid be that honest,''
Hill said. ``We knew we had no chance.''
</P>
<P>
   On signing day, Manning's decision to attend UCLA dominated the
front pages of Fresno-area papers. Hill remarked the next day that
it would be nice if some of the local kids who stayed home were
given more publicity. His comments caused a flap with Manning's
high school coach, Ray Reyes, and Hill called both Manning and
Reyes to apologize for any misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a lot of pub. They blew me up in high school,'' Manning
said. ``Maybe he didn't like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Manning made a critical play in UCLA's 35-21
victory over the Bulldogs. With the Bruins leading 17-7, Fresno
State was driving for a touchdown in the final minute of the first
half. But Manning intercepted a pass and returned it 83 yards to
the Fresno State 11-yard line with 12 seconds left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins kicked a field goal on the final play of the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people wanted me to say (bad) things about him last
year, but I never got caught up in that,'' Hill said. ``Why he'd
say that I have no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Faster feet: On his interception last season, Manning was run
down by Harris, his former high school teammate. In fact, Manning,
a quarterback at Edison, used to throw to Harris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him now I'm not 4.6 (in the 40-yard dash), I'm 4.4,''
Manning said. ``He won't catch me now.''

JURY SIDES WITH FIRED SOUTHWEST BAPTIST COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNN FRANEY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A jury on Wednesday agreed with a former
coach that Southwest Baptist University fired her because she sued
the school, claiming sex discrimination and unequal treatment of
women's teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a happy day, but also a sad day,'' Anne Julian said after
the jury announced its verdict in U.S. District Court in Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   After hugs from her attorney and friends and family, Julian said
she is glad a jury sided with her. But she also has been deeply
wounded during the past two years, she said, because people she
thought respected her now question her integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. (Pat) Taylor (university president) asked me if I wanted
to hurt SBU. I didn't. I want to help SBU,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Retaliation was the only charge the jury considered, because
Julian's claims of sex discrimination were dismissed by U.S.
District Judge Fernando Gaitan.
</P>
<P>
   Julian graduated from Southwest Baptist, a small school in
Bolivar, Mo., in 1990. She was hired in 1996 to coach volleyball
and softball. In 1997 she filed a complaint with the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, claiming she was paid less than
male coaches and was given fewer resources than coaches of male
teams.
</P>
<P>
   She coached softball until 1998. In 1998 she also filed suit for
sex discrimination. She was fired in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Kirksey, the university's attorney, said he was shocked by
the jurors' decision because they had heard school administrators
say they fired Julian because she mistreated her players by not
feeding them when they lost on road trips. They also said she acted
unprofessionally by discussing her lawsuit with her players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' Kirksey said. ``Would we make the same
decision again (to fire her)? Yes. We chose to fight rather than
lie down. We made the best choice. We stood up for the students.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury awarded Julian $1,800 in lost wages for the three
months it took her to find a job after she was fired. The jury also
directed the university to pay her $75,000 for her emotional
anguish.
</P>
<P>
   Julian coaches and teaches at a Kentucky high school.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Kilkenny, a juror from Kansas City, said the testimony
showed the university had ``nitpicked'' at Julian's performance
after she filed suit.
</P>
<P>
   In her first year of coaching, Julian was lauded on campus for
vastly improving the volleyball and softball teams. She received a
job evaluation of ``exceeds some expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   In later seasons, after she complained to the EEOC, the
university questioned her about potential NCAA violations, refusing
to allow athletes to tape their ankles, and making her players go
without food.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe that someone could go from being so good to
so bad in such a short period of time,'' Kilkenny said.
</P>
<P>
   Julian's attorney, Denise Henning, said the lawsuit has prompted
Southwest Baptist to improve conditions in women's athletics. She
hopes the verdict will prompt even more improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked the jury for fair play, and that's what they gave
us,'' she said.

<P>
   ``Retrieving the Tradition and Renewing Evangelicalism'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By D.H. Williams &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Eerdmans, $16) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, a blurb for a Six Flags roller coaster went something
like this: ``The only way out is backward.'' D.H. Williams'
prescription for what he sees as an amnesiac conservative
Protestantism is strikingly similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tradition is not something evangelicals can take or leave,''
he writes in ``Retrieving the Tradition and Renewing
Evangelicalism.'' ``To make any claim for orthodox Christianity
means that the evangelical faith must go beyond itself to the
formative eras of that faith, apostolic and patristic.''
</P>
<P>
   Them's fightin' words among people to whom terms such as
``tradition'' and ``creed'' are cause for caution, if not flat-out
opposition. But Williams makes a strong case for reconsidering the
repudiation of practically everything that went on between A.D. 100
and 1500, although his book is certainly no valentine to the
Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retrieving the Tradition'' challenges stereotypes of not just
the post-apostolic church but the Reformation as well. It's a good
starting point for some welcome thinking. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Word Entertainment/Epic Records &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now well into her 60s _ although her most recent bio doesn't say
just how well _ and showing no signs of slowing down, Shirley
Caesar rolls on like a force of nature.
</P>
<P>
   If you saw her recent show at Bass Performance Hall in Fort
Worth, you know what I mean: On that night, Caesar hollered and
cooed her ageless gospel and her ageless message of salvation,
giving a bravura performance that a woman half her age might have
envied for its immediacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You Can Make It'' is her 35th CD since going solo in 1967 with
``I'll Go.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it sounds like it: There are a number of songs that
are cookie-cutter slices of traditional gospel that never go beyond
the average; one of the weakest is ``Lift Him Up,'' which is
basically Caesar and her background singers shouting ``Lift him
up!'' and ``Praise his name!'' over and over.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the time, though, ``You'' is a powerful testament to
Caesar's 50-plus years as a performer. The CD features her working
with a variety of performers and choirs, including gospel superstar
Bobby Jones &AMP; The Nashville Super Choir Cast and the Mount Calvary
Word of Faith Choir. And, of course, horn sections and the organ
are often deployed to deliver extra punch.
</P>
<P>
   Caesar works her magic with all of them, whether she's doing an
up-tempo song such as ``What Joy'' (a duet with Jones) or a ballad
such as the title song. ``You Can Make It'' is classic Caesar: It
starts quietly, with just piano and her voice, and then builds to a
powerful, stately climax with the help of Jones and his crew.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, ``You Can Make It'' is a worthy addition to Caesar's
legacy, if not her best work. &QL;

COWBOYS OWNER TELLS AIKMAN TO SIT OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ A consenting Troy Aikman will follow owner Jerry
Jones' directive not to suit up Sunday night for the Cowboys' game
at Arizona, because of the medical risks associated with multiple
concussions.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman suffered his eighth-known concussion over a 12-year NFL
career in the season opener Sunday against Philadelphia. It was his
third concussion in his past 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy \Rto accept\S ... but logically, it's probably
the right decision, the smart decision,'' said Aikman, who was
sacked four times and knocked down four more times in a total of 15
plays against the blitz-happy Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Aikman learns that his next concussion, according to
medical opinion, could sideline him ``four to six weeks, minimum.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining his frustration and the nature of concussions, Aikman
added, ``It's just difficult not to go out and play when you feel
like you can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Retirement is not a consideration, Aikman said, ``\Rbecause\S I
don't feel the risks outweigh the enjoyment that I still get from
playing right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, going on the advice of Aikman's two neurosurgeons,
specialists in sports-related head traumas, as well as members of
the Cowboys' medical staff, issued his no-play mandate to his
33-year-old quarterback when the latter showed up Wednesday at
Valley Ranch for business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that this is the best thing,
short-term and long-term, for Troy _ and for the team,'' Jones
said.
</P>
<P>
   Randall Cunningham will get a chance to make his first start in
a Cowboys uniform on prime-time national television. Since his
release by Minnesota three months ago, the 37-year-old Cunningham
has had limited reps with the Cowboys until this week. He
experienced bursitis in his throwing shoulder last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are 0-1 and embarrassed. Aikman is eager to ``erase
what happened'' and remains ``hopeful'' that he will play a week
from Monday night against Deion Sanders and the Washington
Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   There is no timetable, however. Aikman will be re-evaluated at
the start of each week until he returns.
</P>
<P>
   Because he incurred back-to-back concussions last season (Oct.
31 at Indianapolis and Nov. 8 at Minnesota) and missed the ensuing
two games, Aikman said, ``I think that's why there's some real
caution right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman had lingering headaches (''they're pretty consistent'')
Wednesday, although he has no memory loss of those Eagles' blitzes,
and his nausea subsided Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He has had lingering headaches with his sixth, seventh and
eighth concussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take head trauma lightly,'' said Aikman, who has
studied concussions extensively the past two years] with Steve
Young and agent Leigh Steinberg, and knows that the major concern
becomes the cumulative effect of multiple concussions.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman was asked if there is any length of time away from
football that would lessen the chance of the next concussion
sidelining him ``four to six weeks, minimum,'' or is he just that
far along with eight concussions?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good question,'' Aikman said. ``I think if you have
concussions in consecutive weeks \Ryou don't play\S, that's what
the logic is. That's why I'm not playing this week.''
</P>
<P>
   So, why did he play against Minnesota on Nov. 8 after suffering
a concussion eight days earlier at Indianapolis?
</P>
<P>
   `` I don't know that one, either,'' Aikman said.
</P>
<P>
   His latest head injury against Philadelphia was listed as a
``mild concussion,'' to which Aikman said, ``I'm not naive enough
to think that trauma to head is `mild' in any respect.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Aikman took a ``why not?'' approach to playing
this week because 1) he felt good enough, 2) a season of high
expectations still has 15 games remaining, and 3) there's no
prescribed recovery time for a concussion, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be risk two weeks from now \Ragainst
Washington\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman was honest with the situation and with himself, saying,
``I had a voice in the \Rdecision\S as well. But if it had been
left solely up to me, I would've played.''
</P>

   He doesn't know if he can help Cunningham, who gets a
personalized game plan, but he will try. Aikman will attend
meetings, but hasn't decided if he will join the team in Arizona.

 GAY NEWS COVERAGE NOT GOOD, JOURNALISTS SAY  &HT;     By DAN FOST  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Gay journalists have made great strides over the
years but still have a long way to go, according to a survey by the
University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   The survey results were scheduled to be released Thursday at the
National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association conference in San
Francisco, where an estimated 500 attendees will gather at the
Argent Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the gay and lesbian journalists surveyed find the
mainstream news organizations that they work for don't do a good
job of covering issues of importance to the gay community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Journalism these days is more concerned with high drama,
conflict and entertainment value,'' said Leroy Aarons, the study's
co-author and director of the Program for the Study of Sexual
Orientation Issues in the News at USC's Annenberg School for
Communication. ``We're seeing the hot-button stories get a lot of
attention, perhaps at the expense of ongoing day-to-day local
coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   But Aarons is encouraged that today's debate is about the
quality of coverage. Ten years ago, major news organizations did
not cover gay issues as substantially.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a substantial explosion of news about gay and
lesbian issues,'' said Aarons.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that, Aarons said, is owed to gay journalists feeling
able to advocate for their stories in newsrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heterosexual journalists looked to their right and left, and
people who they respected for years came into focus as gays and
lesbians,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It helped that gay stories became important in everyday American
life, from the AIDS epidemic to civil rights pushes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story is still a major story in our society today, perhaps
even more than before,'' Aarons said. ``You see the way its
injected itself into presidential politics, family issues,
adoption, gay marriage and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   The NLGJA did not release specific numbers in the survey,
holding those until Thursday's news conference.

CAMPO GIVES THUMBS UP TO CUNNINGHAM'S WORKOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys coach Dave Campo said Wednesday he
couldn't have been more pleased with what he saw from quarterback
Randall Cunningham in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, who will replace the injured Troy Aikman against the
Arizona Cardinals on Sunday, took all of the repetitions with the
first-team offense. He also showed no ill effects from the sprained
right thumb he suffered against the Philadelphia Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he had a good practice,'' Campo said. ``He was very
upbeat. I felt good about the way he handled himself today. This
guy is excited about jumping out there and playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Campo didn't envision Cunningham playing this soon, he
said the Cowboys signed the two-time MVP quarterback in the
off-season because they wanted someone to win games for them if
Aikman were unable to play.
</P>
<P>
   Campo said the Cowboys have started to add some wrinkles in the
offense to take advantage of Cunningham's scrambling ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we will see what Randall will do under these
circumstances,'' Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys also are preparing for a possible loss of Cunningham
to an injury. Rookie Clint Stoerner took snaps as the backup
quarterback. He will be promoted from the practice squad to the
active roster this week and serve as Cunningham's understudy
against the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Also taking snaps from center Wednesday was running back Emmitt
Smith, who has been tabbed as the team's emergency quarterback in
the event that Cunningham and Stoerner are injured.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who needs 8 rushing yards to reach 14,000 for his career,
could be a couple of ankle sprains away from throwing the first
pass of his NFL career. \Nsubheds:No sympathy from Cardinals The
injuries to receiver Joey Galloway and quarterback Troy Aikman are
making headlines in Dallas. However, the Cowboys won't get any
sympathy from the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona opened the season with nine players on the injured
reserve list, including star receiver Rob Moore and expected
contributors such as defensive tackles Rashod Swinger and Jerry
Drake, and cornerbacks J.J. McCleskey and Coby Rhinehart.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals also are waiting for defensive end Andre Wadsworth
and linebacker Zack Walz to return from off-season knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Things got worse in the season opener against the New York
Giants when starting offensive tackle L.J. Shelton sprained his
left knee. He is out indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the worse things that can happen to a team,''
Cardinals quarterback Jake Plummer said of the injuries. ``We don't
feel much remorse'' for the Cowboys. \Nsubheds:He said it Cowboys
running back Emmitt Smith on the difference between quarterbacks
Randall Cunningham and Troy Aikman: ``Obviously, his skin color . .
. and he's more mobile, too.'' \Nsubheds:Briefly Cowboys cornerback
Dwayne Goodrich returned to practice for the first time since
suffering a strained hamstring Aug. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys cornerback Charlie Williams, out since the beginning of
training camp because of knee surgery and a staph infection,
practiced on a limited basis.
</P>
<P>
   News on whether Erik Williams is fined by the NFL could come
from the league office today. Williams was ejected in the fourth
quarter of Sunday's game after punching an Eagles player.

LAUNCHING OF SHUTTLE WILL BEGIN PUSH TO COMPLETE SPACE OUTPOST 
</HEADLINE>
  By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The space shuttle Atlantis is set to head for the
International Space Station on Friday, beginning an intense push to
finish the long-delayed orbital research outpost.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantis and its seven-member crew are to blast off at 8:45
a.m. EDT on Friday, beginning an 11-day mission to outfit the
growing station for the arrival of its first permanent residents in
November. The flight begins a surge of 15 station-related missions
by American and Russian rockets over the coming year that will
greatly increase the station's size and functions.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
said Wednesday that no major problems stood in the way of the
Atlantis' launch, although there were some concerns about weather.
U.S. Air Force forecasters said there was a 60 percent chance that
weather would not interfere, but coastal showers and low clouds
around the Kennedy Space Center in Florida could pose problems,
particularly with the mission's unusually small launch window.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle managers are giving the shuttle only a 2 1/2-minute
period to lift off starting at 8:45 a.m., about half the time
usually allotted for missions to the space station. A 2-to-3-hour
launch window is common to other shuttle missions.
</P>
<P>
   By launching when the shuttle's ground position is aligned
perfectly with the space station's orbit, officials can, they said,
save fuel normally used to steer the rising shuttle at its moving
target. Having more fuel will make it easier for the shuttle to
deal with any unexpected thrust shortfalls in its three main
engines, they say. It also makes it more likely that the spacecraft
could return to an American landing strip if engine problems
develop, instead of going to one of the emergency sites in Spain or
North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials say the upcoming flurry of flights, after more
than two years of delays in constructing the station, will be one
of the most intense periods of human space flight ever.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Dittemore, NASA's shuttle program manager, said that until
the Russian service module Zvezda docked with the station on July
26, ``we were in a holding pattern.'' Zvezda, containing the living
quarters and control room for the station during its early
construction stages, arrived two years behind schedule because of
Russian financial problems and booster rocket difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``This mission begins a series of station-assembly flights
aboard the shuttle during the next year that will be as complex as
anything NASA has ever done, including landing a man on the moon,''
Dittemore said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantis' mission of hauling equipment and supplies to the
station, and getting the living quarters ready for occupancy by the
first station crew of three, will be followed in October by a
flight by the shuttle Discovery to haul up the first segment of a
scaffolding-like truss on which other segments will be built.
Endeavour is to go up in November with the first segment of
American solar power panels, after the arrival of a Russian Soyuz
ship carrying the first crew.
</P>
<P>
   Eight shuttle flights are scheduled for 2001, starting with
delivery of the American science laboratory Destiny. The last time
NASA flew eight shuttles in one year was 1997, and an all-time
record of nine went up in 1985, the year before the Challenger
explosion, which resulted in cutting back the ambitious shuttle
program.
</P>
<P>
   Because of studies raising safety concerns about launching so
many flights, NASA last year reversed years of workforce reductions
and began hiring hundreds of new people, particularly safety
engineers. And space shuttle contractors have added hundreds more
to help with the accelerated flight rate.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantis' crew of five American and two Russian astronauts will
start this renewed activity by unloading 2 tons of supplies and
equipment it is carrying, and another 1,300 pounds of material from
an unmanned Russian Progress cargo ship which docked with the
station last month. The crew will outfit Zvezda, which was launched
virtually empty of equipment, with food, clothing, exercise
equipment, computers, medical kits, food warmers, gas masks, fire
extinguishers and other necessities. The astronauts also will
install the station's first toilet, a Russian model similar to one
used aboard the Mir space station.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle, commanded by Col. Terrence Wilcutt of the Marines
on his fourth trip into space, and piloted by Cmdr. Scott D. Altman
of the Navy on his second shuttle flight, will dock with the
station on the third day of the mission. The crew will wait almost
two days before entering the station, first conducting a critical
space walk to connect segments of the outpost electronically.
</P>
<P>
   An American astronaut, Edward T. Lu, and a Russian counterpart,
Yuri I. Malenchenko, are to spend 6 1/2 hours scaling the
140-foot-tall station secured to the Atlantis' cargo bay. The
astronauts, climbing 110-feet up the structure, will connect nine
communications and power cables on the most distant spacewalk ever
from a shuttle. Afterward, the crew, including the Americans
Richard A. Mastracchio and Daniel C. Burbank and the Russian Boris
V. Morukov, will enter the station and transfer the supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle is to return to the Kennedy Space Center on Sept.
19.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Executive apologizes in tire deaths
 &HT;    Senate, House hold hearings
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By JENNIFER HOYT
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The CEO of Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. apologized
Wednesday and accepted blame for his company's role in dozens of
fatal crashes linked to faulty tires.
</P>
<P>
   The apology came during tense Senate and House hearings in which
Firestone, Ford Motor Co. and federal safety regulators were
blasted for not sounding the alarm quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   Citing evidence that the two companies had received complaints
from around the world over the past decade, lawmakers challenged
claims by Firestone and Ford officials that they were unaware that
tires were defective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me alarm bells were ringing, but that the people
in a position to do something weren't listening,'' said Sen.
Richard Shelby, R-Ala.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the National Highway Transportation Safety
Administration began investigating accidents in which Firestone
tires suddenly lost their tread or suffered blowouts.
</P>
<P>
   The problem tires, many of them on Ford's popular Explorer, have
been blamed for 88 deaths and at least 250 injuries in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   At back to back Senate and House hearings Wednesday, Firestone
CEO Masatoshi Ono said he was appearing ``to apologize to you, the
American people and especially to the families who have lost loved
ones in these terrible rollover accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Ono, who rarely appears in public, told lawmakers he had ``come
to accept full and personal responsibility on behalf of
Bridgestone/Firestone for the events that led to this hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Nasser, president and CEO of Ford, denied his company
was responsible. ``We know this is a Firestone issue, not a Ford
issue,'' he testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``My one main regret is that we did not ask Firestone the right
questions sooner,'' Nasser said. ``We did everything we possibly
could to replace bad tires with good tires as quickly as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday, The Associated Press cited documents indicating
that Bridgestone/Firestone officials were aware of safety problems
years before its Aug. 9 recall of 6.5 million tires.
</P>
<P>
   The documents also indicate that the ATX II tires included in
the recall account for more than half the injury and property
damage claims Firestone received from 1997 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The confidential documents contradict claims by Ford and
Firestone that no analysis was done on the tires until July and
August, according to the AP.
</P>
<P>
   The tires Firestone has recalled are the P235/75R15-size ATX and
ATX II models, as well as similarly sized Wilderness AT tires. Most
of the tires were made at its plant in Decatur, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The recall by Firestone was issued a year after a similar effort
to replace faulty tires in Saudi Arabia and 16 other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, NHTSA issued a warning about the safety of an
additional 1.4 million tires. Firestone insists there is no reason
to expand the recall to include those tires.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time. Venezuela's consumer protection agency has
recommended that Ford and Firestone be held criminally responsible
for 46 deaths in that country.
</P>
<P>
   Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook told the Senate
transportation subcommittee that Firestone and Ford had covered up
tire safety problems for almost 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the companies knew they had a problem
and they kept it a secret,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Crigger, Bridgestone/Firestone's executive vice president
of business planning, said the company believed tires had failed
because of outside influences such as punctures and not because of
a defect in the tire design.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reviewing the cases, no, there was nothing to indicate
there was a tire defect,'' Crigger said. A pattern did not become
apparent until this, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under heated questioning from lawmakers, NHTSA Administrator Sue
Bailey said Ford had no obligation to tell her agency about its
effort to replace suspect tires outside the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ford would have been required to notify NHTSA of such an
action if it had occurred in the United States, but our regulations
do not apply to actions taken outside the United States,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   From 1991 to 1999, Firestone produced 47 million of the tires
now under investigation. NHTSA received only 46 complaints about
those tires during that time, Bailey said, explaining it was not a
large enough number to trigger an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``In view of the large number of tires that had been produced,
the variety of possible causes of tire failure and the fact that
all types of tires can fail in use, the reports that we received
did not indicate a problem that would warrant opening a defect
investigation regarding these tires,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That changed, she said, after KHOU-TV in Houston broadcast a
report about safety problems with Firestone tires.
</P>
<P>
   By Aug. 1, the agency had received 193 complaints, and that
number has since risen to 1,400. On Aug. 4, NHTSA recommended a
recall, which Firestone announced on Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone's Ono said he still does not know what
caused the tire problems but the company is investigating. ``You
have my word that we will continue until we find the cause,'' Ono
said.

SENATE DEBATES BOND'S PLAN TO PROTECT BARGE TRAFFIC ON THE
MISSOURI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Wednesday night debated whether the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers should be able to change the flow of
the Missouri River to protect three types of endangered birds and
fish.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kit Bond, a Missouri Republican, is trying to keep the
corps from having that option. Under the proposal, the corps could
release extra water at a South Dakota dam at least once every third
spring to improve wildlife habitat downstream.
</P>
<P>
   Bond said that releasing more water could flood farm fields and
hamper barge traffic in Missouri and other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a risky scheme that we cannot afford to gamble on,'' Bond
said. Missouri saw in 1993 and 1995 the devastating effects floods
can have on farms and cities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation groups say higher river levels could enhance
habitats for the pallid sturgeon, a bottom-dwelling fish, and two
endangered birds _ the interior least tern and the piping plover.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife recommended the higher
levels to improve chances for the species' survival, but Bond said
the Missouri Department of Natural Resources and other groups
disagreed that the plan would help.
</P>
<P>
   Bond wants to withhold funding that would allow the Corps of
Engineers to revise its manual, in effect since 1960, so that river
flow could be altered. A Senate vote is expected today.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Daschle, a South Dakota Democrat who is the Senate
minority leader, wants the Bond language removed from the
legislation to finance the corps.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle argued in favor of allowing the flow to be changed,
saying it would give the corps flexibility to adapt to wildlife,
agricultural and recreational needs.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the corps' manual too heavily favors barge operators,
Daschle said. Barges, he said, account for only 0.3 percent of
transportation of farm products.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the tip of the tail wagging the tail and the dog
itself,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   Bond replied that barge traffic was important for farmers
because it provided competition for rail shippers and helped keep
prices down.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle also said concern about flooding was unfounded because
extra water would not be released if flooding seemed likely. But
Bond said that in the 11 days it takes for water to get from South
Dakota to St. Louis, heavy rain could fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only one mistake is all it takes to introduce a
government-controlled flood,'' Bond said. He said that Missouri
Gov. Mel Carnahan, a Democrat, also opposed letting the corps
release more water upstream.

MARKET PLACE: RISE IN RATES NOT STEMMING EURO'S SLIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Higher interest rates don't seem to be helping.
</P>
<P>
   The euro, born amid optimism some 20 months ago, suffered the
worst day of its young life Wednesday, as it lost 2.3 percent of
its value against the dollar, settling at 87.01 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The European currency also hit a record low against the Japanese
yen as it briefly traded below 92 yen.
</P>
<P>
   It was just over a week ago, on Aug. 31, that the European
Central Bank raised interest rates for the sixth time in a year.
The central bank then expressed concern over the ``protracted
depreciation'' of the euro, which is down 26.5 percent against the
dollar since Jan. 4, 1999, the first business day for the euro _
the currency of 11 European countries.
</P>
<P>
   The euro has long since come to seem quite cheap by many
measures, like purchasing power parity, but that has not helped the
currency to rally. Nor have higher interest rates helped.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that higher interest rates help to bring in money
to an economy, but while that may be true in some circumstances, it
is not helping now.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the story is that the United States has also been
raising interest rates as well, but the other part of the story is
that it is not debt investments that now drive investment flows. It
is the equity investments, both through stock purchases and direct
foreign investments, that have driven the dollar up and the euro
down.
</P>
<P>
   It is in that environment that the dollar has performed well
despite a high and growing current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
   That deficit, largely driven by the trade deficit, must be
financed by foreigners willingly reinvesting the money in
dollar-denominated assets. So far they have been more than willing
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Given that current reality, the best course if Europe wants to
support its common currency would seem to be to make itself more
attractive for equity investors, and to some extent it has done so.
European growth is at its highest levels in a decade, albeit still
below growth in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very impressed by European corporate restructuring,''
said Nicholas P. Sargen, global market strategist for J.P. Morgan's
private clients. He compared the restructuring to that embarked
upon by many United States companies in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Germany is overhauling its tax structure in a way
that is widely viewed as attractive to foreign investment and is
likely to be imitated by other European countries.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that has been enough to make European investments
seem more attractive than American ones, and raising interest rates
may hurt if it threatens to slow growth and thereby make equity
investments less attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are tightening because your currency is weak, and your
real economy and markets are also weak, it is not going to work,''
Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig Securities, said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The euro has not been helped by the fact that while it is one
currency, it has 11 governments. There have been efforts to get
those 11 governments to show solidarity in defense of the currency,
but in fact some Europeans like a weak currency. European exports
are booming, in part because of the falling euro, and that eases
pressures for structural reforms to European economies that are
strongly resisted by European unions, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current euro-dollar rate is more of a reason to be happy
than concerned,'' said Gerhard Schroeder, the German chancellor, in
a speech on Monday that helped to provoke the latest decline.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's German economic data showed some of the results of
the weak euro. Unemployment fell to its lowest level in five years,
although it still remains at 9.5 percent of the work force, in part
because of strong factory orders from abroad. ``The export orders
were very strong,'' noted John McCarthy, director of foreign
exchange at ING-Barings Capital Markets.
</P>
<P>
   But McCarthy said there was nonetheless a wave of selling of the
euro from Americans after it became clear that the currency was
moving decisively below 89 cents, the area where it bottomed in May
before rallying back above 96 cents in June. The currency had ended
Tuesday's trading at 89.06 cents.
</P>
<P>
   When the euro was introduced, there were widespread predictions
it would be a strong currency, continuing the historic role of the
German mark.
</P>
<P>
   But the current level of the euro is equivalent to a value of
2.24 marks to the dollar _ the highest level for the dollar since
1986, when the dollar was falling from historically overvalued
levels.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, interest-rate-denominated investments were much
more important in driving currency flows, and U.S. interest rates
had fallen sharply. In addition, the U.S. economy was slowing.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the euro's weakness may end only when U.S.
investments come to seem less attractive, either because U.S.
markets are falling rapidly or because the U.S. economy appears to
be in danger of a recession. Neither possibility seems very likely
to investors at the moment.

LIEBERMAN VISITS KANSAS CITY, SPRINGFIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE and SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A blue-jeaned Joseph Lieberman wandered amid
newly assembled motorcycles Wednesday before rolling out parts of a
Democratic economic plan that he said would keep Americans on the
road to prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut senator's second day of campaigning through
Missouri took him in the early morning to the Harley-Davidson plant
near Kansas City International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this works as we hope and believe it will, maybe someday
the names `Gore' and `Lieberman' will enjoy as much respect as the
names `Harley' and `Davidson,' &UR; '' he told workers.
</P>
<P>
   He later moved on to Springfield and the campus of Southwest
Missouri State University, where he read a speech echoing Vice
President Al Gore's economic address Wednesday in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' plan calls for paying off the national debt by
2012, prohibiting lawmakers from spending Social Security and
Medicare funds on other needs and raising the average family's
income by one-third over the next decade, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman talked of how the proposal includes the creation of
tax-free 501(j) accounts that workers could use to cover the cost
of training and new tax credits for companies that retrain workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As good as the last eight years have been, if we work
together, the next eight can be even better,'' the
vice-presidential nominee said.
</P>
<P>
   Before his talk, the senator toured the state-of-the-art plant
in faded denims and steel-toed boots. He admired the sleek
motorcycles and sat aboard a 1200 custom Sportster.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a beautiful operation,'' he told about three dozen
workers who assembled to hear the candidate. ``I told my wife this
morning...where I was going,'' he said. ``She got nervous, because
now she figures I'm going to want to buy a bike.''
</P>
<P>
   And something else caught his attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``This group of workers has the strongest handshakes that I've
met in one place in America.''
</P>
<P>
   His appearance drew different responses from workers.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Hines, who works in the paint department and who plans to
vote for Texas Gov. George W. Bush, said Lieberman's comments on
Medicare troubled him. ``He just started throwing numbers out. I
wanted to hear the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Reiley, a production technician, had a different reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he answered the questions real well,'' said Reiley,
depicting Lieberman as sincere and down to earth. And he
appreciated Lieberman's attire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a Harley look to him,'' Reiley said. ``But there wasn't
a lot of leather.''
</P>
<P>
   The visit came one day after a new poll commissioned by The
Kansas City Star showed Gore leading Bush in Missouri by 45 percent
to 41 percent. The GOP nominee had led by 11 points in an early
July survey.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said he was eager to visit Springfield. ``We're going
to go everywhere in Missouri,'' he said in an interview with The
Star. ``We think we've got a program...that should appeal across
the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Once in the Republican stronghold, Lieberman read his economic
speech to an appreciative but restrained audience of more than 300
people on the Southwest Missouri State campus. There, he pushed the
Democratic ticket's proposal for focused tax cuts for retirement
savings and spending on college and job training.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a moment in time to make real what two centuries of
Americans could only dream about: to empower every American, to
lift up every citizen,'' Lieberman said. ``Let our descendants look
back to this time and place and say, `We were up to the
challenge.' &UR; ''
</P>
<P>
   He depicted the 10-point Gore plan as a more fair way of using
the federal budget surplus than that proposed by the GOP ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush looks at the surplus and wants to give most of
it away in one fell swoop,'' Lieberman said, arguing that most of
the Republicans' tax cuts help the rich. ``We shouldn't used our
hard-earned prosperity to give the most to those who need it least,
and the least to those who need it most.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman used about a fourth of his talk to bash Bush's
proposals. He even ad-libbed a line to say that low interest rates
have saved Americans more money on their home and car loans than
they could expect to reap from Bush's tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Clipping through the Democrats' ambitious set of promises, he
pledged significant tax breaks for the middle class for expenses
such as sending a child to college or caring for an elderly parent.
And he continually added assurances:``We can do it...You better
believe we can change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman did little to tailor his speech to either Springfield
or Missouri, other than to add to his prepared remarks ``at
universities like this'' when referring to education. The roughly
three hours he spent in Springfield after his speech were occupied
not in meeting Missouri voters or even raising money but conducting
satellite interviews with TV networks about the Gore plan.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Mel Carnahan, a candidate for the U.S. Senate, appeared
with Lieberman. Carnahan, adopting much of the tone sounded by
Lieberman, said the deficit reduction under the Clinton
administration may not be the focus of grateful kitchen table
conversation, but it is responsible for America's widespread
prosperity. And he attacked Bush's ideas as ``flawed plans that
give most of the (tax) relief to the elites.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's speech of about 40 minutes, he later told local
party officials, was by far his longest of the campaign. And
although he drew occasional applause, it was clear he was reading
nearly every word and his audience responded in similarly
restrained fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the most exciting speech I've seen in my life,''
said Andrea Margel, a Southwest Missouri State student from St.
Charles, Mo. ``But it sounded like he was trying to be responsible
with the money.''

 &HT;    Issuance of marriage license makes historic union official
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By JOHN W. GONZALEZ
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A love-struck couple from Houston made history on
Wednesday by obtaining the first marriage license issued in Texas
to two lesbians _ a union that will be legal under current state
law because one of them used to be a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody keeps talking about us making history. We just want
to get married,'' said transsexual Jessica Wicks, who plans to wed
Robin Wicks here on Sept. 16 now that Bexar County Clerk Gerry
Rickoff has issued them a license.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love her with all my heart and soul and we deserve to be
married,'' said Jessica Wicks, who was born a male, Grady Roland
Wicks. ``I pray that somehow, some way, this will open the doors
for gays and lesbians everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   License in hand, standing on the county courthouse steps with
her fiance, Robin Wicks _ who already changed her surname as a sign
of devotion to her partner of four years _ said ``love is all there
is. It shouldn't matter who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These two people make a very lovely couple and there's nothing
wrong with them, other than the fact that they're head over heels
in love,'' said their lawyer, Phyllis Randolph Frye, also of
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Frye exhorted similar couples from around the nation to come to
San Antonio to be married here under an appellate court ruling that
applies only to Bexar and 31 surrounding counties. The decision by
the state's 4th Court of Appeals said a person's chromosomes, not
genitalia, determine their gender for the purposes of determining
whether they are legally married.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm inviting any trans-man _ that is, a female to male
transsexual _ who has a boyfriend and they are in a gay male
relationship, as well as any trans-woman who is male to female and
is now living with a woman and they're in a lesbian relationship,
to come to the 4th Court's jurisdiction,'' Frye said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what state you live in you can take a week's
vacation, fly in, get a marriage license that day, wait 72 hours
and get married,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Wicks, 53, a retired state employee, and Robin Wicks,
44, a social worker, initially sought the $36 license in Harris
County, but were rejected. Officials there said Texas law doesn't
permit same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   However, due to the regional appellate court's ruling, which
does not affect Harris County, Rickoff said he had no choice but to
grant the license.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 ruling, which has been appealed to the U.S. Supreme
Court, was a setback for transsexual Christie Lee Cavazos
Littleton, whose seven-year marriage to a San Antonio man, now
deceased, was ruled invalid as part of a wrongful death damage
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told Christie she couldn't be married to a man and
they're (Harris County) telling Jessica that she can't be married
to a woman. So what they're saying, in effect, is that transsexuals
can't be married to anyone,'' Frye, herself a transsexual, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We notified the (Bexar) county clerk and we asked them to
study the law and they agreed in these 32 counties that if a woman
has an `M' (male) on her original birth certificate, she can marry
another woman who has an `F' (female) on her original birth
certificate,'' Frye said.
</P>
<P>
   Although news accounts of the impending marriage set off a
bitter debate among religious conservatives,
gay-lesbian-transgender activists and others, Rickoff said he had
very few critical calls from the public about his decision to grant
the license.
</P>
<P>
   The Wickses apparently will be only the second lesbian couple in
the nation to legally wed. A Vermont couple with similar
circumstances were the first to tie the knot, Frye said.

NO WORKER CAN CAST A `TYPICAL' BALLOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ What difference will it make to the typical worker
whether it's Al Gore or George W. Bush with his hand on the Bible
next January?
</P>
<P>
   Psst. Don't answer. It's a trick question.
</P>
<P>
   Who's a typical worker?
</P>
<P>
   Look at just one issue important to workers: Social Security.
Now think of all the individual variables: income, lifetime
savings, life expectancy, inheritance, length of time in and out of
the workplace, health, marital status, disability and so on.
</P>
<P>
   So who's a typical worker?
</P>
<P>
   If the question were easy, you'd find human resource experts
trumpeting the candidate with the better plan to make retirement
funds available. (Hint: There's no consensus.)
</P>
<P>
   And even if you think candidates' campaign promises come true,
you can only go with the guy who seems to best connect with your
self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   Back to Social Security. Both candidates say they're against
cutting benefits. Great, says the ``typical'' near-retired worker
who has planned his or her retirement around the expectation that
the check will be in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Not so great, says the ``typical'' younger worker, who may never
work anywhere long enough to get vested pension rights. What about
a needs test? Why should that Cadillac-driving country club member
get money he doesn't need when there may be none left for me?
</P>
<P>
   Except for some on the political fringe, the ``typical'' worker
agrees with both candidates that the Social Security trust fund
must be supplemented to handle the retirement tidal wave.
</P>
<P>
   But what's the best supplement for the ``typical'' worker?
</P>
<P>
   Gore wants to give individual workers refundable tax credits to
help create private, voluntary, tax-free savings accounts
independent from the Social Security fund. The $2,000 annual
accounts would be built partly with individual savings and partly
with tax credits, with lower-income workers getting a larger
government share.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan would give workers a choice to invest part of their
Social Security payroll taxes in private, personally controlled
retirement accounts. Individuals would make free-market investment
decisions for some of the money that now is managed by the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Does the ``typical'' worker want to manage his or her own
retirement money?
</P>
<P>
   Financial surveys often indicate that when it comes to savings
and investments decisions, many U.S. workers aren't educating
themselves and aren't making wise decisions now.
</P>
<P>
   They're spending more and saving less. They're not enrolling in
company employee stock ownership programs. They're letting valuable
stock options expire unexercised.
</P>
<P>
   So does the ``typical'' worker understand the Social Security
debate and know its individual implications?
</P>
<P>
   Remember, too, the candidates' Social Security platforms cover
much more ground than how to supplement the trust fund. And Social
Security is just one among many workplace issues.
</P>
<P>
   Will ``typical'' workers do more than listen to sound bites
about which candidate is better for them?
</P>
<P>
   That's a question you can try to answer.

CO-FOUNDERS OF AFRICANA.COM SELL VENTURE TO TIME WARNER 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Facing an uncertain climate for Internet start-ups, the founders
of Africana.com Inc., the Harvard University professors Henry Louis
Gates Jr. and Kwame Anthony Appiah, have sold their venture to Time
Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Gates said the deal would help keep the Web site alive. ``The
revenue model was slow to develop, let's put it that way,'' he
said. ``I would have become worried about its future by next year
unless there was some dramatic turnaround.'' Terms of the deal were
not announced.
</P>
<P>
   Africana.com is one of many Web sites seeking a worldwide
audience of African descent but takes a uniquely pedagogical
approach. It concentrates on educational content, from cultural
history lessons to advice on dental hygiene and investing,
sometimes offering advice on generic subjects like health or
finance from experts who are African-American. Other features, like
links to music from radio stations around the world, address the
``African diaspora.'' Gates and Appiah started the site to promote
an encyclopedia that they edited, Africana.
</P>
<P>
   Gates said Africana.com still records far less traffic than
others in its market, like NetNoir.com, which focuses on
celebrities, or BlackVoices.com, which features chat rooms.
Africana.com is for-profit but does not sell banner advertisements,
seeking sponsorships instead. ``We didn't want a lot of cheap ads
that would dilute the brand,'' Professor Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Adler, a spokesman for Time Warner, said the company
hoped to use the portal to exploit its extensive library of film,
television and music of interest to African-Americans. The company
also envisions cooperation between Africana.com's management and
its traditional media units like Time magazine and CNN, he said.
When Time Warner's proposed merger with America Online Inc. is
completed, Adler said, the company may include Africana.com with a
version of AOL distributed free to schools.
</P>
<P>
   Gates said he and Appiah would continue to work on the site as
``consultants and idea people.'' The site has about 20 employees,
who will continue operating it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other partners have included the music entrepreneur Quincy
Jones, the former Time Warner executive Martin Payson and Harry M.
Lasker III, a computer consultant.

NEW DNA TESTS ARE SEEN AS KEY TO VIRGINIA CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. _ Lawyers for Earl Washington Jr., a model
prisoner with the mental development of a 10-year-old, filed a
petition Wednesday for a full pardon after 17 years in prison, 6
years after a DNA test raised strong doubts about his conviction in
a rape and homicide.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the petition was filed, the lawyers were awaiting
results of a more definitive DNA test that they said in the
petition they were certain would clear Washington of the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The new DNA test was ordered by the governor in the spring.
Though Washington's lawyers maintain that the test usually takes a
month or less to complete, a spokesman for the governor said the
test was not concluded.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers, who specialize in the increasingly successful DNA
challenges of criminal convictions, describe Washington as an
amiable, passive farmhand with an IQ of 69 who has a weakness for
agreeing with authority figures. They maintain his case is a
summary of the main problems prompting the rising national concern
about fairness in capital convictions: race, mental incapacity,
prosecutions based solely on confessions, appeal limitations and
the inevitable pressures of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was only days from execution in 1994 when his death
sentence was commuted to life by then- Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, a
Democrat, after the initial DNA test. That test raised the
possibility that someone else might have been involved in the
crime, but state officials insisted it was not conclusive.
Washington accepted the offer of life without parole, but a battery
of lawyers has continued to fight to overturn his conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earl's case has it all, beginning with bad lawyering and a
false confession,'' said Barry C. Scheck, a professor at the
Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University, who is
co-director of the Innocence Project, the pro bono DNA defense
program.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers expressed concern that Gov. James Gilmore, a
Republican close to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican
presidential candidate, might choose to ``split the baby''
politically and keep Washington in prison as part of a 30-year
sentence in an assault case not connected to the murder. Typically,
the assault conviction by itself would have merited parole by now,
they noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a ridiculous and unsubstantiated thing to say,'' Mark
A. Miner, Gilmore's spokesman, responded in rejecting any
suggestion that politics was a factor in the case. He noted that
Gilmore had ordered the new DNA test in the first place. ``The
governor takes each petition very seriously and personally reviews
the details,'' Miner said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was convicted of raping and murdering Rebecca L.
Williams, a 19-year-old mother of two, in Culpeper in 1982. Across
years of legal criticism, police and prosecutors have defended
their methods, noting that a federal appeals court upheld the
conviction in 1991. The court did so while finding that Washington
was ``easily led'' by the police and that the prosecution evidence
_ the confession _ presented ``difficulties for any fair-minded
jury.''
</P>
<P>
   The Culpeper police chief, C.B. Jones, who headed the Williams
investigation, emphasized that it was a jury, not the police, who
found Washington guilty. ``Even if he didn't do the rape, there's
still a possibility he did the other,'' Jones said when asked about
the latest DNA appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Police began questioning Washington about the unsolved murder
and three other sexual assaults when he was arrested in 1983 after
a drunken family dispute in which he assaulted a neighbor. Agreeing
to waive his right to an attorney, Washington initially confessed
to all four unsolved crimes, but three of the inquiries were later
dropped when evidence and witnesses contradicted his confessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I told them what they wanted to hear,'' Washington
said in an interview this summer at Keen Mountain Correctional
Center in southern Virginia. ``I didn't commit the murder,'' he
gently added. When asked why he nevertheless confessed, Washington
was almost inaudible in answering with a smile and a shrug, ``I
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   His conviction was based on a confession constructed of one-word
``yes'' answers to a series of leading questions. The transcript
showed detectives repeatedly correcting, if not coaching Washington
when he offered erroneous details, such as misidentifying the crime
scene, confessing at first to two stab wounds when the body bore
38, and identifying the victim as black.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, a 40-year-old black man, quickly corrected himself
when contradicted. ``Well that's wrong, Earl, she was white,'' a
detective informed him about the victim after one crucial answer,
according to the interrogation transcript that appeal lawyers
underlined after his conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, she was white,'' Washington amended.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get Earl Washington to agree he shot President Kennedy
or did just about anything else,'' said Eric M. Freedman, a
professor at Hofstra University. He has helped Washington across 15
years of court and executive appeals, arguing that his retardation
was exploited repeatedly in the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's original defense did not challenge the confession
or bring to light serology evidence that no trace of the defendant
was found on a blanket used in the rape and homicide. The lawyers
who later took up his cause emphasized that their task was greatly
burdened by the fact that Virginia has one of the most restrictive
appeal procedures in the nation, allowing only 21 days after
sentencing to present new evidence. In contrast, the most liberal
states set no time limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This necessarily politicizes the appeal process by leaving it
solely in the governor's hands,'' said Peter Neufeld, co-director
of the Innocence Project. Neufeld conceded that part of the reason
for making the pardon petition public was to openly press the
governor to reject keep Washington in prison solely for an assault
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The new DNA test is more sophisticated than the original in
being able to check at least 13 genetic markers for a possible
match rather than the single marker studied six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the last nine years, there have been 67 DNA exonerations
across the country of prison and death row inmates. Of these, 1 in
5 involved convictions based solely on confessions, according to
the Innocence Project, which was involved in 41 of the 67
exonerations.
</P>
<P>
   Before DNA was used as an appeals tool, Virginia was the first
state in the nation to use genetic technology in creating a DNA
identity bank to which state felons are required to provide blood
samples. The decade-old program contains more than 120,000 samples
and has been used to find suspects who matched DNA evidence in
about 30 killings and more than 150 other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In their optimism, Washington's lawyers have speculated that the
DNA bank might be powerful enough now to identify another party as
Williams' murderer, providing Gilmore with a dramatic outcome for
the Washington case.  &QL;

 &HT;    `ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE'
 &HT;    104-year-old tells how she survived 1900 hurricane
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By KEVIN MORAN
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lorraine Hofeller was only 4 years old when she lived through
the Great Storm that devastated Galveston in 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Now 104, she still fears hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been scared all my life'' of threatening weather, she
confided Wednesday from the southwest Houston retirement center
where she recently moved.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 8, 1900, she and her family _ parents Ben and Belle
Isaacs and brother Mortimer, 10 _ lived in a frame house at 2012
Broadway in Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   The house, built with its first floor about 10 feet above
ground, stood in the highest part of the city, about 8 feet above
sea level.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of the storm, she and her mother visited a
neighbor a block over.
</P>
<P>
   When rains started about noon, Hofeller recalls, her mother
decided it was best to head home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't even take an umbrella,'' she said. ``Instead of
going around the block, we went the back way through the alley.
When we got home, it really started to rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father, a grocery broker, came home for lunch, and her
brother brought in the family pet, a fox terrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``They brought the dog in, and then all hell broke loose,'' she
said Wednesday, recalling that the family sat in the dining room in
the middle of the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat on my mother's lap all night, it seems to me,'' she
said. ``My mother was so scared, and my father was scared, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The house withstood the storm.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the family discovered the second-floor ceilings
were sagging from water that had leaked through where shingles were
blown from the roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father took his walking cane and punched a hole through it,
and all the water came down, and it scared me to death,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After the storm, the little girl, her mother and her brother
took a wagon to Dickinson and then caught a train to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But soon they returned and were part of the effort to rebuild
Galveston, which had suffered more than 6,000 deaths and saw nearly
4,000 homes destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1913 she graduated from Ball High School, after beating four
boys to be elected senior class president. She notes that was in
the days when women didn't have the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
   She married Sigmar Hofeller in 1919, and in 1934 they moved to
Houston, where he sold insurance. They reared two daughters, Elaine
Kuper, now 77, and Marion Levi, 75, both Houston residents.
</P>
<P>
   Sigmar died in the mid-1960s, after 45 years of marriage. The
family now includes four grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, as Hofeller told her story, Kuper and a
granddaughter, Houston school trustee Laurie Bricker, 51, were
there to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Storm lore of many families is preserved in written or
oral accounts collected from survivors who have since died.
</P>
<P>
   Houstonian Margaret Ray tells one such story. Because her
grandmother fainted in front of just the right house, Ray's mother
survived the storm.
</P>
<P>
   As a child in the 1920s, Ray, now 80, heard the tale many times
from her mother, Grace Fine Stenzel, who was 11 when the storm
struck.
</P>
<P>
   Grace Stenzel died in 1979, but Ray put the story of Alice
Atkins Fine's fortuitous faint in writing.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Fine, who had been ill, was alone with her children,
Grace, Enos, Edith and Mary, when they discovered water in their
front yard on the morning of the storm. Fine's husband, Joseph, was
out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that the family lived at 722 Church Street.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's grandmother decided to move her children to higher ground
_ a good thing because the area where they lived was wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were walking through the water when, all of a sudden, my
grandmother fainted,'' Ray said. ``Fortunately, they happened to be
in front of a two-story house where a man was looking out of a
window at the storm and saw her faint. He rushed out and brought
the whole family into his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind was so strong that it had blown part of their clothes
right off their backs,'' Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   As the storm tore the city apart, water drove everyone to the
second level, but the house and those inside survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother said she never knew the name of the man who took them
in,'' Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's family lore isn't all so pleasant. ``When the tin roofs
flew through the air, Mother said, they sometimes beheaded horses
that were struggling in the water,'' Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   Her grandmother also told of looters who went to work
immediately after the storm, taking jewelry from bodies, even
cutting off fingers to get rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother said the authorities announced that if anyone were
caught looting, they would be made to dig their own grave and would
be shot on the spot,'' Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly wiping out Galveston, the storm swept toward
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In League City, Alison Adams, his wife, Nora, and their five
children lived in the caretaker's cottage at a cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Leatie Adams, born Aug. 28, 1900, was too young to remember the
storm. But she left a letter before she died, relating what her
parents and oldest brother, Grover, told her.
</P>
<P>
   Her family was huddled on a feather bed and her father held a
kerosene lamp when the roof blew off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mattress went sailing out and landed on a small peach tree
on the bank of Clear Creek, which was by now a raging torrent,''
Leatie Adams wrote. ``We were all still on the mattress, and Papa
still had the lamp in his hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleo Robinson, 79, Grover's daughter and a retired Houston
schoolteacher, said: ``Dad always remembered that his daddy tied
his wife and the five children to trees with bedsheets, and that is
the way they survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was so remarkable that five children, including
the baby, were all saved,'' said Robinson, who lives in Hillcrest
Village near Alvin.
</P>
<P>
   Some survivors' tales include humor.
</P>
<P>
   Galvestonian Linda Macdonald's grandfather, Clarence LaCoume,
was 6 when the storm struck. Until his death at 88, LaCoume told
her the family's survival tale, describing winds ``like a thousand
demons screaming in the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, she smiles when she recalls another of his memories. Of
French descent, his father operated a Galveston bakery.
</P>
<P>
   Venturing outside the morning after the storm, family members
found a barrel of unspoiled wine in the bakery doorway.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather told me,'' Macdonald said, ``that his father
turned to him and said: `See, son? Don't ever forget that, even in
times like these, the good Lord remembers the needs of a
Frenchman.'''

CLINTON TALKS WITH BARAK AND ARAFAT, BUT NO PROGRESS REPORTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (changes dateline from New York to United Nations) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ In back-to-back sessions Wednesday evening,
President Clinton met with the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak,
and then the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, to salvage the
progress made in peace talks last month, but afterward the White
House said there was little movement.
</P>
<P>
   The president's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said that, as expected,
``no breakthrough'' was achieved. ``But the process is not broken
down, it is ongoing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mood was downbeat, after Clinton met with the leaders in the
upper floors of the Waldorf-Astoria in a kind of hasty urban
reprise of the bucolic Camp David talks six weeks ago. To build
pressure on the leaders, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met
with Arafat as he waited for Barak to finish with the president,
and she also met with Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia before
he sat down with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the president had reviewed possible compromises
with the leaders on the main issues, including the future status of
Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees, but he declined to
give details. The session with Barak was quite brief, less than an
hour, and the meeting with Arafat, with whom the Americans feel
they need to do the most work, lasted about 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said there were no proposals Wednesday night for the
next steps in the process. ``I don't want to say there is no hope
for next steps _ I don't know what it is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, administration officials said that once Wednesday's
highly anticipated meetings were over, the president would be
assessing whether it would be worthwhile to bring the leaders
together again in another meeting in the manner of the Camp David
meeting. They said this would be done only if the leaders were
close to signing an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   With a full array of world leaders in town, the White House
seemed to be seeking out Arab leaders in particular in their effort
to persuade Arafat that time was running out for a peace agreement.
Clinton met with Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia after his session
with Arafat and earlier Albright spoke with the Egyptian foreign
minister, Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, both Barak and Arafat spoke from the
rostrum of the General Assembly, stating fairly familiar positions
that included more generous terms than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Barak called Jerusalem ``the eternal capital of Israel'' and
then went on to say: ``We recognize that Jerusalem is also sacred
to Muslims and Christians the world over, and cherished by our
Palestinian neighbors.'' He also stressed the short timetable,
which the United States believes is framed by the return of the
Israeli Parliament at the end of October. Barak has only a one-vote
majority in the Parliament and faces the likelihood of having to
call an election. Without a peace agreement, it would be an
election he could well lose. ``History will judge what we do in the
next days and weeks,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Arafat said: ``We remain committed to our national
rights over East Jerusalem, capital of our state and shelter of our
sacred sites, as well as our rights on the Christian and Islamic
holy sites, maintaining that the city should be accessible to all,
and open onto its western side.''
</P>
<P>
   In a reflection of the touch-and-go dynamics of the peace
process, a senior administration official said before Clinton's
meetings Wednesday that the positions of the parties had slipped
some since Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   There had been some ``forward movement'' in some areas, but in
other areas, ``I would say that they haven't necessarily stayed
exactly where they were,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration said that during Camp David
considerable headway had been made on subjects that had been taboo,
particularly the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   But the senior administration official said that ``it's been
hard to build on the advances that were made.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Palestinian official, Saeb Erekat, who had been quite
optimistic after Camp David, said that more than two dozen meetings
between the two sides in the last six weeks had produced little.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said they expected Arafat to return home
this weekend to meet with the Palestinian Central Council, where a
decision would be made on whether to declare a Palestinian state.
Palestinian officials have indicated that rather than declare a
state on Sept. 13, as they had pledged, November or even later
might be set as a new date.
</P>
<P>
   A number of European and Islamic nations have encouraged Arafat
to delay his declaration of a state and concentrate on a peace
settlement with Israel.

CONFERENCE TO ADDRESS CONCERNS ABOUT PRICE AND DELIVERY OF
PROPANE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The fifth annual Rural Energy Conference is
set to open Sunday in Kansas City amid concerns about the price and
delivery of propane, the heating fuel for much of small-town and
rural America.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, which will continue through Tuesday, comes as
wholesale propane prices have risen about 60 percent from a year
ago. Consumers could spend $200 to $300 more to heat their homes
with propane this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Propane customers have been waiting for a break in prices this
summer but, unlike past summers, it hasn't happened. Now the
industry worries that consumers will continue to delay filling
their tanks until the last minute. That could swamp the fleets of
trucks owned by propane companies to deliver the propane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hearing some real concerns out there,'' said Pat Westhoff,
program director of the Food and Agriculture Policy Research
Institute at the University of Missouri-Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Propane prices already have begun to affect farmers who use
propane to dry grain. Some crops are being left longer in the field
in the hope they will become drier naturally, Westhoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts say there are sufficient supplies of propane for
the coming winter. Instead, questions are being raised about the
distribution network that gets the fuel to the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is getting it out to the marketplace,'' said Bard
Black, a consultant at Propane Resources, an energy consulting
company in Mission that is sponsoring the energy conference.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns may not become reality, but propane companies and
their trade associations are urging consumers to fill their propane
tanks as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The next few weeks are considered crucial. ``We need to be
moving on this now,'' said Daniel Myers, executive vice president
of the National Propane Gas Association.
</P>
<P>
   The association is telling consumers they shouldn't delay the
purchase because of a possible decline in propane prices. While
predictions about future prices are difficult to make, the
association says any price relief is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrellgas LP in Liberty, the largest propane retailer in the
United States, is taking a proactive approach before any problems
develop, said Pam Blase, a company spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   She said customers were being urged to talk to their propane
representative about filling their tanks. One program available to
help budget the cost is a level-payment plan.
</P>
<P>
   Propane is a byproduct of crude oil and natural gas, which have
risen in price. Natural gas, a popular heating fuel in the Midwest,
is also expected to cost consumers an extra $200 to $300 to heat
their homes this winter.
</P>
<P>
   But propane customers are among the first to get sticker shock.
</P>
<P>
   Propane customers have to buy the fuel and store it for future
use. A typical storage tank for residential use holds 250 gallons
of propane that at today's retail prices can cost up to $300 and
more to fill. Over the winter, the tank may need to be refilled
three times.
</P>
<P>
   The Rural Energy Conference, which will be held at the Hyatt
Regency Crown Center hotel, expects to attract 250 persons. Besides
general sessions about rural energy, there will be workshops on
several issues, including propane prices and the infrastructure to
deliver the fuel. For more information, go to www.ruralenergy.com
or call (913) 262-1545.

BUSH VOWS HE WILL STICK TO HIS DEBATING SCHEDULE 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The wrangling over the presidential debates intensified
Wednesday, as Vice President Al Gore continued to insist that Gov.
George W. Bush accept an independent commission's schedule of
debates, while Bush vowed to show up next week for a television
debate he helped to set up regardless of whether Gore was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to Washington, you bet,'' Bush said on NBC's
``Today'' show, in response to a question about his proposed debate
on ``Meet the Press,'' with Tim Russert, on Tuesday at 10 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's on my schedule. And I hope he's there,'' Bush said of
Gore. ``After all, it was on Mr. Russert's show, where he clearly
said that he would show up if I showed up, and I'm showing up.''
</P>
<P>
   But NBC officials said there would be no prime-time edition of
``Meet the Press'' on Tuesday if Gore was not on hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offer of a debate has always been contingent upon
acceptance by both candidates,'' said Barbara Levin, an NBC
spokeswoman. ``We have no interest in favoring one candidate or
another.''
</P>
<P>
   All the maneuvering has left the staging of any debates up in
the air. The Commission on Presidential Debates, a bipartisan group
that has been running the candidate showdowns since 1988, has a
longstanding invitation to both contenders to appear in three
debates on college campuses in October, an offer Gore accepted
months ago. On Sunday, Bush countered with his own plan, which
included one of the 90-minute commission debates but replaced the
others with one-hour forums on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' next week
and CNN's ``Larry King Live'' on Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has invited the campaigns to meet to settle their
differences, but thus far only the Gore campaign has agreed to go.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who denounced Bush's offer as an effort to duck the
commission debates because he was trying to limit the viewers, has
said he is amenable to debating on the two programs. But he added
that Bush must first consent to the commission's debates, which
traditionally are broadcast live across the spectrum of major
broadcast and cable news networks.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's plan would make it impossible for the candidates to
adhere to the commission's schedule, because the date for the
proposed encounter on King's program _ Oct. 3 _ is the same as the
first commission debate, at the University of Massachusetts in
Boston. Aides to Bush last week had expressed particular opposition
to that debate, because of the university's proximity to the John
F. Kennedy Library, an institution honoring a Democratic president.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether CNN had been made a party, perhaps unwittingly, to
efforts to scuttle the Boston debate, CNN said that it was the
candidates who had the power over the schedule and that the Bush
campaign itself chose the Oct. 3 date.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are in control of when and where they debate,'' said
Christa Robinson, a CNN spokeswoman. ``What CNN did was put an
offer on the table that did not have a specific date on it.'' But,
she added that no debate would occur without Gore's participation.
</P>
<P>
   The degree to which Bush is pushing his counterproposal was
underscored Wednesday, when the Bush campaign introduced a new
commercial taunting the vice president for not accepting Bush's
debate plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was politically convenient, Gore said he'd debate
`anytime, anyplace, anywhere,''' an announcer says, concluding,
``If we can't trust Al Gore on debates, why should we trust him on
anything?''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial drew an immediate condemnation from the Gore
campaign, which contended that it was Bush who was avoiding
debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the latest act of political chicanery,'' said Chris
Lehane, the Gore campaign press secretary. ``The bottom line is,
he's bobbing and weaving and dodging by not putting the debates
before the largest number of people possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's alternative plan drew complaints from other corners.
Ralph Nader, the Green Party nominee for president, sent letters to
all the major cable and broadcast networks Wednesday, asking that
he be included in any debates they show. Nader wrote that the
inclusion of him and the Reform Party candidate, Pat Buchanan,
would, among other things, make the debates more entertaining.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Documents released Wednesday provided additional
evidence that Bridgestone/Firestone and possibly Ford Motor Co.
knew about a pattern of tire failures long before a recall was
announced in August, and lawmakers began calling for tighter
regulation of the auto and tire industries.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosures came in a long day of hearings on Capitol Hill
in which Masatoshi Ono, the chairman and chief executive of
Bridgestone/Firestone, the American unit of Bridgestone Corp. of
Japan, read apologies in halting English. ``I come before you to
apologize to you, the American people and especially to the
families who have lost loved ones in these terrible rollover
accidents,'' Ono told senators in the morning, squeezing in a
reference to what some tire industry officials describe as an
excessive tendency of Ford Explorers to roll over when they lose a
tire.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats alike refused to accept Firestone's
apologies or each company's efforts to blame the other. One after
another, members of Congress accused both corporations of having at
least blithely ignored public safety, and perhaps of having
conspired to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ford and Firestone had at a minimum a moral obligation to make
sure that the products they sell to the American public and other
people in other countries are safe,'' said Sen. Richard Shelby,
R-Ala. ``And yet they both failed to bring this issue to consumers'
and the federal government's attention, at the cost of dozens of
lives, I am afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also called for a larger budget for safety regulators
and proposed federal criminal penalties for any future cases in
which companies might be found to have knowingly sold products with
lethal defects.
</P>
<P>
   After Ono's statement, Ford's chief executive, jabbed back at
Firestone. Jacques Nasser, Ford's chief executive, said in prepared
remarks, ``This is a tire issue, not a vehicle issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But the central issue of the hearings was the question of what
each company know and when.
</P>
<P>
   House investigators showed reporters a Firestone financial
statement indicating that the tire maker had found a pattern of
tire problems earlier than the company has admitted in the past. In
the document, dated Jan. 19, 2000, Firestone's financial managers
calculated that $1.84 million of the $2.88 million in legal claims
against the company for tread separation problems were for tires
made at one of its 10 North American tire factories.
</P>
<P>
   The statement identified Firestone's factory in Decatur, Ill.,
as making the problem tires. Previously, Firestone said it had not
noticed the problems in Decatur until early August, when Ford
conducted an analysis of Firestone quality data.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone is now recalling and replacing 6.5 million light truck
tires installed mainly on Ford Explorers, including all 15-inch
Wilderness tires made in Decatur for the Explorer since 1996. The
Firestone data shows that the Decatur plant had its worst quality
problems from 1994 through 1996, when hundreds of replacement
workers were employed there during a long dispute between Firestone
and its unionized workers.
</P>
<P>
   Before that statement was disclosed, Gary Crigger, Firestone's
executive vice president of business planning, told a Senate panel
that Firestone had immediately notified regulators in early August
upon becoming aware of a problem.

 WASHINGTON: a problem. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rep. Heather Wilson, R-N.M., challenged Firestone officials
Wednesday on why the tire maker's safety officials did not take
action if the company's financial staff was aware of a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you looked at it from a financial point of view and not a
consumer safety point of view?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Crigger responded, ``I'm sorry to say that's the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford also gave House investigators Wednesday a copy of an
internal memorandum from March 1999, describing how the company
handled the replacement of problem Firestone tires on Ford
Explorers in Saudi Arabia. On Tuesday, congressional investigators
gave reporters a copy of the memo with one section blacked out.
</P>
<P>
   That version showed that Firestone officials had been leery of
sending a letter to tire owners in Saudi Arabia for fear that it
might have to inform the U.S. Department of Transportation and that
it might be banned from the Saudi market. ``They feel that the U.S.
DOT will have to be notified of the program, since the same product
is sold in the U.S.,'' the Ford memo stated.
</P>
<P>
   But the complete memo included a section in which the memo's
author, a Ford official named Chuck Seilnacht, mentioned that a
colleague at Ford shared Firestone's worries.
</P>
<P>
   Corey MacGillivray, an official in Ford's general counsel's
office, ``was concerned about the implications,'' as well, the memo
said. ``He was going to check with one of his colleagues to get
more info.''
</P>
<P>
   Firestone's Crigger said that he had been aware of discussion
within the company's legal department of how to handle tire
problems in Saudi Arabia, but was not familiar with the details.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Firestone, Ford sent a letter to owners of Explorers in
Saudi Arabia several months later that they should get new tires.
Ford also took out advertisements to promote the tire replacement
effort, and covered the program's expense after Firestone refused
to do so on the grounds that the tires were failing because of
customers' misuse.
</P>
<P>
   The tires replaced in Saudi Arabia were 16-inch Wilderness
tires, a size that has not been recalled in the United States,
although some lawyers for consumer contend they should be.
</P>
<P>
   If Ford and Firestone knew of problems and did nothing, federal
regulators could impose up to $925,000 in fines. But the two
companies and possibly their executives could face criminal charges
by state and local prosecutors, who could accuse them of
culpability in deaths that occurred after the companies clearly
became aware of problems, said Joan Claybrook, who was the
administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
under President Jimmy Carter, and is now the president of Public
Citizen, an advocacy group. A local prosecutor in Indiana tried to
charge Firestone officials with criminal negligence after the
company's huge tire recall in 1978, but was unsuccessful, she said.
</P>
<P>
   If the public comes to perceive Ford and Firestone as culpable,
that could also help lawyers for consumers win larger punitive
damages in lawsuits against the companies. The biggest potential
damage to both companies, however, is that their images could be so
sullied that customers start shying away from their products. Ford
and Firestone both say that their August sales showed little effect
from the recall, but some independent tire dealers say that many
customers are now avoiding Firestone tires.
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials repeated Wednesday their contention that they had
asked Firestone repeatedly over the last two years to check the
tires for defects, and had been assured every time that any
problems resulted solely from customers' abuse of the tires.
</P>
<P>
   But senators and representatives were unsympathetic, saying that
Ford had a responsibility to make sure that it put safe tires on
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ford, too, when faced with hundreds of complaints of major
tire defects on the Explorer, failed to respond with the sense of
urgency that one would expect when the safety of so many people
rested on its shoulders,'' said Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers' proposals Wednesday emphasized harsher punishment for
violators of safety rules and closer government monitoring of the
auto industry, with little attention to new safety rules for tires.
A few of the proposals put forward were so far-reaching that even
safety activists spoke against them at the hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., proposed that the Transportation
Department assign inspectors to auto factories much as the
Agriculture Department assigns inspectors to chicken processors,
and that automakers be required to forward their quality-control
data to the government. Claybrook said that regulators did not have
the staff necessary for such an ambitious undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said that he planned to introduce
legislation as early as Sept. 7 to establish federal criminal
penalties, possibly enabling a charge such as second-degree
manslaughter, for the executives of companies that knowingly sell
defective products that kill consumers. Automakers lobbied
successfully to defeat a similar measure in 1966, when the nation's
auto regulatory system was set up.
</P>
<P>
   Violations of federal auto safety rules are currently punished
with a fine on the manufacturer of no more than $925,000, plus a
mandatory recall of the defective vehicle, auto part or tire.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sen. Shelby, the Alabama Republican who is the chairman of the
Senate Appropriations subcommittee for transportation, which held
one of Wednesday's hearings, said that he would consider an
immediate increase in the budget of the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, which is part of the Department of
Transportation. The agency's budget was cut almost in half at the
beginning of the Reagan administration, and remains one-third lower
than it was in the Carter administration, after adjusting for
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Auto defects have received little attention on Capitol Hill for
many years. Sue Bailey, the safety agency's administrator, pointed
out that the agency recommended on March 24 that Congress enact
tougher laws, including an increase in the limit on civil penalties
to at least $1 million. But no member of Congress has introduced a
bill with these proposals, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The current session of Congress is scheduled to end Oct. 4, with
only 21 more working days. Bills and budget changes introduced this
late in a session usually have little chance of passing, but Sens.
Specter and Shelby said in interviews that Congress and the nation
were so interested in the tire issue that legislative action was
possible, and even likely.
</P>
<P>
   The tire recall appears to have had fairly little effect on
sales of sport utility vehicles. SUV sales rose 5.1 percent in
August from the level of a year earlier, while the overall auto
market was flat. But all of the growth in sport utility sales
occurred in small car-based models like the Chrysler PT Cruiser,
which the auto industry classifies as sport utilities to qualify
for more lenient regulations that cover light trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of larger SUV models like the Ford Explorer, which tend to
be based on pickup truck designs, fell .9 percent in August, partly
because the Explorer itself, the nation's best-selling sport
utility, had a drop of .8 percent. Sales of pickup-based sport
utilities soared in the mid-1990s, but their growth has been
slowing since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., said that he would use the Firestone and
Ford issue to seek quick passage of legislation barring companies
from sealing information relevant to public safety in court
settlements of lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for consumers contend that Ford and Firestone have
hidden many documents with such secrecy orders.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Petrauskas, Ford's vice president for safety and
environmental issues, said Ford only sealed the amounts of
settlements and did not seal engineering information.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for consumers said it does not appear that
Bridgestone/Firestone has softened its litigation stance in the
past week, despite the threat of criminal prosecution in Venezuela,
pressure from federal regulators to recall additional tires and
blistering hearings in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The heightened scrutiny ``has had no effect whatsoever,'' said
Bruce Kaster, a lawyer in Ocala, Fla., who has been a leader in
suing Bridgestone/Firestone over tread separation problems.
``There's no indication of any willingness on their part to soften
their position on discovery or settlements or anything else.''
Firestone is only settling cases, he said, ``when they start
getting nervous.''

COMMENTARY: GUARDING YOUR IDENTITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS ``North'' to ``South'' in 3rd graf) 
By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A stalker paid only $45 to an Internet research service to get
Amy Boyer's Social Security number. That supposedly private,
personal information led her former suitor to the workplace of the
20-year-old New Hampshire woman. He murdered her and killed
himself.
</P>
<P>
   That's the sort of horror story that moves officials to make a
pass at action. The Senate Appropriations Committee, at the behest
of the New Hampshire Republican Judd Gregg, sent to the floor a
bill prohibiting individuals from ``displaying to the public''
anybody's Social Security number without consent.
</P>
<P>
   His weak bill exempts ``information brokers'' that led the
stalker to his prey. But it's a start, and could be toughened by
the Democrat Fritz Hollings on the appropriations panel; that South
Carolinian has been topping John McCain's privacy protection at the
Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Over in House Ways and Means, a privacy bill with teeth in it is
sponsored by the chairman of the Social Security subcommittee,
Florida's Clay Shaw. Not only would it outlaw the sale of the
identifying number, but would brand as an ``unfair trade practice''
the withholding of services from a consumer who declines to reveal
his Social Security number.
</P>
<P>
   No longer would a merchant be able to say ``no Social Security
number, no credit _ even if you have a good credit card.'' That
number of yours has a resale value to other companies eager to
target you for dinnertime telemarketing, charitable solicitations
or employee monitoring. It is the key to the door of your identity.
As in Amy Boyer's case, professional snoops can also offer your
unique government identifier to a stalker.
</P>
<P>
   But even symbolic bills like Gregg's can open the way to
stronger protection. A law passed last year, excoriated in this
space as ``the Gramm-Summers sellout,'' allowed merged banks and
insurance companies to pass around personal data on clients and
patients without their consent. The banking lobby's triumph,
however, contained one good deed for consumers: it enabled the
Federal Trade Commission to curb the easy ``redisclosure'' of
nonpublic, personal information by what calls itself ``the lookup
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The FTC two months ago issued a rule that is enraging credit
reporting services, skip-tracing divorce lawyers and some
journalists. No longer can ``credit header'' information be bandied
about cheaply and quickly. To obtain your name and address, Social
Security and telephone number, and mother's maiden name, the buyer
of your personal information must now plunk down the money for an
entire consumer report.
</P>
<P>
   That may be meager protection, but it's drawn court challenges
from irate snoops. The willingness of the FTC chairman, Robert
Pitofsky, to withstand the wrath of the online marketers is a straw
of hope in the winds of privacy violation.
</P>
<P>
   Another straw can be seen in the envelopes you have been getting
from the Internal Revenue Service for the past couple of years: The
plastic windows showing your address are smaller. Why? It's so that
any neighbors and postal workers who may be identity thieves won't
be able to see your Social Security number without steaming open
the envelope and thereby breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
   This idea was adopted last week by the Treasury Department,
stung by harangues that Secretary Larry Summers' see-through
worship of financial transparency was adding to worries about
identity theft. ``By removing Social Security numbers from the
windows of the mailings of Social Security checks,'' an underling
announced proudly, ``we will help safeguard the privacy of millions
of Americans.'' That's 14 million fewer times each month that our
SSN's will not be on public display.
</P>
<P>
   I push this envelope because it shows that even bureaucrats have
begun to feel the groundswell against invasions of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   So do presidential candidates. George W. Bush was first to
specify his support of ``opt-in,'' requiring sellers to seek
informed consent of buyers before trading in personal information.
And Al Gore, standing beside Amy Boyer's parents, said, ``I will
make it a federal crime to buy or sell anyone's Social Security
number.''
</P>
<P>
   There's time before the election to see which man's party is
serious about the privacy issue. It goes into the decision mix.
</P>

 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have found what they say is the first direct evidence
of cannibalism among prehistoric Indians in the American Southwest,
belying the image of these people as steadfastly peaceful farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The finding may well reignite a long-smoldering controversy over
whether ancestral Indians ever made it a practice to eat human
flesh, a conclusion deeply resented by their descendants.
</P>
<P>
   The latest evidence sprang from the site of an ancient Anasazi
settlement near Mesa Verde in southwestern Colorado, where
archaeologists came upon butchered human bones and stone cutting
tools stained with human blood. A ceramic cooking pot held residues
of human tissues. But the most telling of the evidence was found in
human feces: biochemical tests revealed clear traces of digested
human muscle protein in the dried coprolite, or fossilized
prehistoric feces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Analysis of the coprolite and associated remains at last
provides definitive evidence for sporadic cannibalism in the
Southwest,'' Dr. Brian R. Billman, an archaeologist at the
University of North Carolina, said Wednesday in an announcement of
the discovery.
</P>
<P>
   The biochemist who conducted the tests, Dr. Richard A. Marlar of
the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver, said the
only way this particular human protein, myoglobin, would be present
in the feces was if the person had eaten human flesh. The tests and
other research were repeated many times over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we had to be absolutely sure on such a sensitive and
controversial issue,'' Marlar said in an interview. ``I have no
doubt about this data.''
</P>
<P>
   The research team _ Marlar, Billman and colleagues _ described
and interpreted the findings in a report being published in
Thursday's issue of the journal Nature. In an accompanying
commentary, Dr. Jared M. Diamond, an anthropologist at the
University of California at Los Angeles, called the research
``compelling evidence'' of the practice of cannibalism by some
ancestral Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The chief descendants of the Anasazi are the Hopi and Zuni
tribes, which have never practiced cannibalism and object to
archaeologists' inferences of cannibalism by their prehistoric
ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Donald Grayson, an anthropologist at the University of
Washington who specializes in prehistoric people of the American
West, said in an interview that he was not surprised by the
biochemical finding. ``I was already convinced by the evidence of
butchering marks and bones from archaeological sites'' elsewhere,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists think that cannibalism among people in the
American Southwest occurred between A.D. 900 and 1150 but was then
fairly rare, probably happening when a community was faced with
starvation.
</P>
<P>
   After that, for about 50 years, the evidence suggests, there was
an outbreak of what is known among anthropologists as ``customary
cannibalism.'' Diamond described this consumption of human flesh,
from either deceased relatives or slain enemies, as a nonemergency
practice, rather than what a group might resort to in the face of
starvation as the Donner party of American pioneers did in the
winter of 1846-47.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings are hardly the first indication of cannibalism
among the Anasazi. Butchered human bones and other mounting
evidence were described by Dr. Christy Turner II, an anthropologist
at Arizona State University, in his book, ``Man Corn: Cannibalism
and Violence in the Prehistoric American Southwest.'' Turner is on
an expedition to Siberia and could not be reached for comment on
the new findings.
</P>
<P>
   But the evidence is still disputed by some anthropologists and
especially by modern Indians. Archaeologists who previously
reported suspected cannibalism have said they were sometimes
accused of contributing to racism and genocide; some early European
colonists used stories of Indian cannibalism as justification for
their conquests.
</P>
<P>
   The debate, now decades old, intensified in 1979 when Dr.
William Arens, an anthropologist at the State University of New
York at Stony Brook, argued in an influential book, ``The
Man-Eating Myth,'' that there had been no reliable firsthand
accounts of cannibalism. So he doubted the very existence of the
practice, except perhaps in circumstances of near-starvation.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach Arens for comment Wednesday were unsuccessful.
But in a 1998 article in The New Yorker, he was quoted as having
apparently changed his mind. Asked about Turner's research, Arens
said cannibalism was a ``possible interpretation, even a good
interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, all previous evidence of occasional Indian cannibalism,
though increasingly persuasive, was circumstantial. It was the
discovery of the human feces, in an ancient dwelling at the site in
Colorado, that opened the way to gathering direct evidence, through
biochemical analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The prehistoric feces were found as a result of a preservation
effort by the Ute tribe. When archaeological sites in the foothills
of Sleeping Ute Mountain were about to be destroyed by newly
irrigated agricultural fields, the Utes called in Soil Systems
Inc., an archaeological excavation company in Phoenix. Billman, who
worked for the company then, led the investigation of a community
of 70 to 125 people that existed there between A.D. 1130 and 1150.
</P>
<P>
   It was a time of severe drought, one of the worst in the
American West in the last 2,000 years, and this provoked conflicts
between farmers who had settled in the community and intruders from
surrounding areas. ``We believe the entire community was
extinguished in a single episode of violence and terroristic
cannibalism during a period of social chaos brought on by the
drought,'' Billman said.
</P>
<P>
   The raiders responsible for the killing may have considered the
local farmers themselves to be intruders on withered farming land
who had to be driven away. After killing, cooking and eating seven
people in that one dwelling, one of the raiders squatted over the
cold ashes of the hearth and defecated, a parting sign of contempt.
</P>
<P>
   When Billman gave that account at an archaeological meeting,
Marlar, an amateur archaeologist as well as a biochemist, offered
to try to develop a technique for testing the feces for any traces
of human tissues. Biochemical assay techniques had been used before
to identify animal meat residues in cooking pots at archaeological
sites. And the presence of the human myoglobin, the headline on
Nature's commentary said, was ``Incontrovertible Evidence of
Cannibalism.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Nature report, Markar, Billman and their colleagues
concluded, ``With the presentation of the first direct evidence of
cannibalism in the American Southwest in the prehistoric era, we
hope that the debate will shift from the question of whether or not
cannibalism occurred to questions concerning the social context,
causes and consequences of these events.''

FTC INVESTIGATES 2 COMPANIES' GENERIC-DRUG ACTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission said Wednesday that it was
investigating whether Bristol-Myers Squibb and a small California
company called American Bioscience might have illegally colluded to
keep the lower-cost, generic version of Bristol's top-selling
cancer drug, Taxol, off the market.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC said in court papers filed in U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles that the terms of the agreement between Bristol-Myers and
American Bioscience ``raise potential competitive issues,''
including questions about whether the two companies were trying to
keep generic Taxol off pharmacy shelves, potentially harming
consumers. Taxol, a drug discovered by the federal government,
generated $1.5 billion in sales for Bristol-Myers last year.
</P>
<P>
   Generic drug companies often charge about 30 percent less than
the price of a brand-name drug during the first six months that the
generic drug is on the market. After the first six months, the
price sometimes falls to less than 50 percent of the price charged
by the brand-name drug manufacturer. Over all, generic drugs save
consumers billions of dollars a year, according to the
Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration gave Ivax, a generic drug maker
based in Miami, tentative approval last month to sell generic
Taxol. But while the FDA said that Ivax's drug was just as
effective and safe as Taxol, the regulators said they could not let
Ivax sell the drug because of a complex legal agreement between
Bristol-Myers and American Bioscience. Under that agreement,
Bristol-Myers had listed a patent owned by American Bioscience that
is related to Taxol in a publication maintained by the FDA, which
is known as the orange book.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Bristol-Myers said, ``Since we just learned of
the investigation, it would be inappropriate for us to comment at
this time.'' American Bioscience did not return repeated calls
asking for comment on the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC's inquiry is part of a broader effort to stop brand-name
drug companies from illegally trying to keep lower-cost generic
drugs from being sold.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers and American Bioscience had asked Judge William
Matthew Byrne Jr. of the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles to
approve the agreement between them and to order Bristol-Myers to
keep American Bioscience's patent listed with the FDA. Under
federal law, the listing of that patent could have blocked Ivax
from selling generic Taxol for as long as 30 months. Such a delay
would have allowed Bristol-Myers to maintain its monopoly on Taxol,
a coup that could have been worth more than $2 billion in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, when Ivax learned of the agreement between
Bristol-Myers and American Bioscience, company executives called it
just ``another scheme'' to keep them from selling the lower-cost
drug.
</P>
<P>
   But both Bristol-Myers and American Bioscience denied Ivax's
accusations. American Bioscience said that it was asserting its
legitimate rights to a patent granted to it by the U.S. Patent
Office. To go ahead with development of a drug covered by that
patent, American Bioscience said it needed Bristol-Myers to list
the patent in the orange book.
</P>
<P>
   American Bioscience had filed suit against Bristol-Myers
demanding that Bristol list the patent with the FDA Byrne had
issued a temporary restraining order last month, ordering
Bristol-Myers to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Byrne said that he should not have issued the
restraining order because he did not have jurisdiction over the
matter. But it was not clear Wednesday night whether Bristol-Myers
would remove the patent from the orange book, which would free Ivax
to sell the lower-cost drug.

DEBATES PICKED BY BUSH WOULD DRAW SMALL AUDIENCES 
</HEADLINE>
 (With CAMPAIGN-DEBATES) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the presidential debates were held on the networks and days
chosen by George W. Bush, the Republican candidate, they would
almost surely be seen by the fewest number of people ever.
</P>
<P>
   The shows and networks chosen by Bush have never reached even
half as many viewers as the least-watched previous debate. That
took place four years ago, when the second Clinton-Dole debate _
carried by the three major networks and CNN _ reached a total of
36.3 million viewers. The ratings were diminished by the
competition from the Fox network, which that night chose to
broadcast a Major League Baseball playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that audience represents more than twice the viewers of
CNN's ``Larry King Live'' the night in 1993 when Al Gore debated
Ross Perot about the North American Free Trade Agreement. That
debate reached 16 million viewers, by far the most-watched night
ever for that cable program.
</P>
<P>
   It is also about nine times as many people who saw Gore debate
Bill Bradley on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' last December, which
reached 4.71 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has chosen the King and Russert programs as substitutes for
two debates set by the Commission on Presidential Debates, which
would be broadcast by all the networks.
</P>

   If the CNN and NBC debates take place, they would be the first
in a presidential election not carried by more than one network.
ABC and CBS have said they would not broadcast debates conducted as
part of programs on another network.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Taylor, the executive director of the Alliance for Better
Campaigns, a group arguing for a rise in free media time devoted to
the presidential race, called the system of debates covered by
every network, ``something that needs to be defended for the sake
of the democracy.'' He did not fault the news organizations for
proposing more debates, but said that ``jockeying by candidates is
imperiling the debates that can be seen by the entire country.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor questioned how a debate limited to coverage on a cable
network like CNN could substitute for a debate covered by every
network. ``You should not have to pay a subscription fee to have a
front-row seat at democracy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was only in the past two presidential elections that debates
were not broadcast live by every major network. Contracts with
Major League Baseball compelled CBS in 1992 and the Fox network in
1996 to broadcast playoff games rather than presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a drop in the number of viewers for the debates.
But the drop was much more significant in 1996, when ratings for
the two debates that year hit a historical low. They averaged 40.6
million people, down from an average of 66 million for the three
debates in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, two Bush-Dukakis debates reached 65.1 million and 67.3
million viewers. The most-watched debate of all time was the only
debate of the 1980 campaign, between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy
Carter, which reached more than 80 million people.
</P>
<P>
   NBC offered to move ``Meet the Press'' to prime time Tuesday,
replacing the 10 p.m. program, ``Dateline NBC.'' That program
averages about 11 million viewers a week. CNN and the Fox News
cable network have said they would carry the debate, as would the
NBC-owned cable channels MSNBC and CNBC. But that might add only 2
million to 3 million more viewers.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has not committed to broadcasting the debate agreed to by
CNN on Oct. 3 because it has a commitment to a baseball playoff
game.

COURT TO CONSIDER BAIL FOR SCIENTIST IN SECRETS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES STERNGOLD

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ An appeals court announced Wednesday that it would
hold a hearing on Monday on whether Wen Ho Lee, the former Los
Alamos scientist accused of mishandling nuclear weapons secrets,
could be released from prison on bail pending trial.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes after prosecutors last week persuaded the
court to block a federal judge's decision granting Lee bail after
more than eight months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
in Denver, ordered the hearing closed to the public because it
might involve the discussion of classified material.
</P>
<P>
   The court has told the lawyers for the two sides that they
should be prepared to make 15-minute presentations. It was unclear
when the judges might render a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was arrested and indicted last December on charges that he
illegally downloaded a complete library of nuclear secrets to
portable computer tapes with the intent of harming the United
States. James A. Parker, a federal judge in Albuquerque, N.M.,
where the case is being heard, ruled at that time that he could not
be released on bail because of government charges that he posed a
grave threat to national security.
</P>
<P>
   But at a hearing last month, an FBI agent admitted that he had
provided misleading testimony about Lee in December, and several
experts disputed government assertions that the information Lee
downloaded amounted to the ``crown jewels'' of the nuclear program.
Parker ordered Lee released to a highly restrictive form of home
detention on $1 million bail. Prosecutors appealed and sought a
stay of the bail decision until the appeal was heard.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court granted the government a temporary stay on
Friday. If the appeals court lifts that stay, Lee would be released
to home detention while the appeal of the bail order worked its way
through the legal process, which can take months. Lee's trial is
scheduled to begin on Nov. 6.
