	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ Mark McGwire is hitting home runs so fast,
he's rewriting history with almost every prodigious swing of his
bat.
	   McGwire hit his 53rd homer to become the first National League
players to hit that many in 49 years Sunday as St. Louis lost 4-3
to the Pittsburgh Pirates.
	   McGwire became just the third NL player to hit as many as 53
homers in a season, joining the Pirates' Ralph Kiner (54 in 1949)
and the Chicago Cubs' Hack Wilson, who hit a league-record 56
homers in 1930.
	   McGwire, who broke Babe Ruth's record for homers over three
consecutive seasons with a tape-measure homer Saturday, hit a 2-2
pitch from Ricardo Rincon deep into the left-field seats with two
outs in the eighth inning.
	   McGwire's sixth homer in five days left him eight short of tying
Roger Maris' record of 61 in 1961 with 32 games to play, and it
rated him the rarest of ovations _ a curtain call on the road.
 &UR; Astros 13, Cubs 3 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Sammy Sosa's 50th and 51st homers carried far over
the ivy-covered walls at Wrigley Field. The just couldn't carry the
Cubs.
	   Sosa's 51 homers are the second-most in the club history and
left him trailing McGwire by two in the race to overtake Roger
Maris' 61.
	   The Cubs' club and NL record is 56 homers by Hack Wilson in
1930.
	   Craig Biggio hit a pair of three-run homers and Brad Ausmus had
four hits, including a three-run homer, and five RBIs as the Astros
increased their NL Central lead to 9{ games over Chicago.
	   Sosa had gone nine at-bats since his last homer Friday when he
drove a 3-2 pitch from Houston's Jose Lima (13-6) completely over
the bleachers in left-center field in the fifth inning.
	   The drive, that cut Houston's lead to 4-2, was estimated at 440
feet.
	   With a crowd of 38,714 at Wrigley Field standing and chanting
his name, Sosa stepped out of the dugout for a curtain call.
	   That was about all the fans had to cheer about until Sosa came
to bat again in the eighth. Then he hit a 1-0 pitch from Lima deep
into the left-field bleachers.
 &UR; Padres 13, Brewers 11 &QC; 
	   In Milwaukee, Jim Leyritz's two-run double in the 10th helped
San Diego win a wild one.
	   The teams combined for 33 hits against 12 pitchers in a game
that took 2 hours, 3 minutes to complete the first four innings.
Both teams had identical scorelines _ 8 runs, 10 hits and 3 errors
going into the fifth.
	   In the 10th, Steve Finley walked leading off and took third on a
single by Greg Vaughn before Leyritz doubled to right-center off
Bob Wickman (6-7). The Padres scored a run to tie it 10-10 in the
ninth when Andy Sheets grounded into a double play.
	   Trevor Hoffman (4-1) pitched two innings for the victory.
	   Vaughn set a career-high with his 42nd homer, a 455-foot
(138-meter) shot in the third inning that was the longest homer at
County Stadium this season. He his 41 homers in 1996.
 &UR; Diamondbacks 4, Mets 3 &QC; 
	   In New York, the host Mets blew a bases-loaded threat in the
ninth inning.
	   Trailing by two runs, the Mets loaded the bases with no outs
against Gregg Olson on singles by Brian McRae and pinch-hitter
Lenny Harris and a bunt single by Luis Lopez.
	   But Olson struck out pinch-hitter Matt Franco, got pinch-hitter
Carlos Baerga on an RBI grounder and retired Tony Phillips on a
game-ending groundout. Olson got his 22nd save.
	   Al Leiter (12-5), who has the second-lowest ERA in the majors at
2.36, lost for only the second time in 11 decisions since May 17.
	   Brian Anderson (9-12) won for only the second time in a month
despite allowing his major league-leading 33rd homer, a leadoff
drive in the fourth by Edgardo Alfonzo.
 &UR; Giants 10, Marlins 5 &QC; 
	   In Miami, Barry Bonds homered to become the first player to hit
400 home runs and steal 400 bases.
	   Bonds reached the unprecedented milestone in the second inning
with his 26th homer of the year against Kirt Ojala. It gave Bonds
400 in a 13-year career to go with 438 steals.
	   Three other players hit 300 homers and stole 300 bases _ Willie
Mays (660 homers, 338 stolen bases), Andre Dawson (436 and 314) and
Bonds' father, Bobby (332 and 461).
	   Bill Mueller and Charlie Hayes also homered off Ojala (1-3).
Kirk Rueter (13-9) allowed five hits and three runs in seven
innings for the Giants, 8-0 this year against Florida.
	   San Francisco closed to within three games of the New York Mets,
the NL wild-card leaders.
 &UR; Reds 10, Expos 0 &QC; 
	   In Montreal, Sean Casey hit a three-run homer and drove in five
runs and Jason Bere pitched seven shutout innings for Cincinnati.
	   Casey, who went 3-for-4, had an RBI double in the first and a
run-scoring single in the second. He hit his fourth homer in the
fourth to chase Montreal starter Javier Vazquez (4-13).
	   Bere (1-0) allowed three hits and combined with two relievers on
a four-hitter as the Reds blanked the Expos for the second straight
day.
	   Montreal has lost four straight and 11 of 13.
	   Barry Larkin scored runs and was driven in by Casey the first
three times he reached base.
 &UR; Rockies 5, Phillies 2 &QC; 
	   In Philadelphia, Mike Lansing hit a three-run homer and John
Thomson won his third consecutive decision for Colorado.
	   Thomson (8-8) allowed nine hits and two runs in seven innings.
	   Chuck McElroy pitched the eighth and Jerry Dipoto finished for
his 16th save.
	   Mike Grace (4-7) took the loss.
 &UR; Braves 12, Dodgers 7 &QC; 
	   In Atlanta, Greg Maddux became the NL's first 17-game winner
despite one of the worst starts of his career as Atlanta beat Los
Angeles.
	   Andres Galarraga hit his 40th homer in his first at-bat since
being ejected Saturday for charging the mound as the Braves came up
with enough runs to give Maddux (17-6) the shakiest of wins.
	   The four-time Cy Young Award winner, coming off his 200th win
and leading the majors with a 1.65 ERA, was pounded for 10 hits and
seven earned runs but managed to hang on until the fifth because
Dodgers starter Carlos Perez was even worse.

Two polls gauge impact of Diana's death as anniversary nears
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A new opinion poll published Monday in a tabloid
newspaper indicates the majority of Britons are still in mourning
nearly a year after Princess Diana's death, while a poll for a
competing newspaper suggests her death has not had a lasting effect
on most people.
	   Asked whether they still felt sorrow over her death, 77 percent
of women in a telephone poll conducted for The Mirror newspaper
said they did, while 56 percent of men agreed. One in 10 women said
her death has changed the way they live their lives.
	   But the results of the poll, conducted on 500 people Aug. 17 and
Aug. 18 by ICM Research, were in contrast to a similar survey
carried out for The Independent newspaper, which also published
results Monday.
	   In that poll, 80 percent said Diana's death had not had any
lasting effect on them, and 75 percent thought the nation is no
different as a result of her death.
	   The poll of 1,064 people surveyed between Aug. 7 and Aug. 11
found that 17 percent overall _ 21 percent of women and 14 percent
of men _ said it had ``changed the way I think about life.''
	   The poll also found that 53 percent believe the Aug. 31
anniversary of the Paris car crash that killed Diana should not be
marked each year. Forty-one percent said it should, while the rest
expressed no opinion.
	   Both polls gauged public attitudes to the remaining members of
the royal family.
	   In the Mirror poll, 54 percent criticized the royal family's
public reaction to Diana's death as lacking emotion. Thirty-four
percent said their reaction was about right, while five percent
said it was too emotional.
	   Three quarters said Charles should not marry Camilla and 54
percent said the throne of England should bypass him and go
directly to his son, William.
	   Although 43 percent said Charles has been a better father since
Diana's death, only 11 percent said they like him more than they
did a year ago. Eighty-three percent said their opinion had not
changed and six percent said they like him less.
	   Princess Anne, the queen's only daughter, topped the poll's
league table of favorite royals, followed by William. Charles came
bottom of the list, but when asked who they liked least, the
queen's husband, Prince Philip topped the list, followed by
Charles.
	   In the Independent poll, respondents were divided over whether
Diana's death has made the royal family more in touch with the
public, with 44 percent saying they are more in touch and the same
number saying there has been no change. Eight percent said they
were less in touch.
	   Neither poll stated a margin of error.
	   The two polls came a day after another survey found that public
attitudes to the Prince Charles and his relationship with Camilla
Parker Bowles have softened significantly in the year since his
former wife's death.

Chernomyrdin back atop Russian government, Kiriyenko out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Chernomyrdin holding consultations, fresh quote
from Ryzhkov, ADDS background on economy, Chernomyrdin. Will be led
after Chernomyrdin arrives at government headquarters, scheduled
for 10 a.m. (0600 GMT). &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Dumped unceremoniously five months ago, former
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was back in power Monday and
facing one of the worst crises to confront Russia since the Soviet
collapse.
	   President Boris Yeltsin dismissed the government of Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko on Sunday, displaying a capriciousness
that has begun to worry people here and abroad.
	   Without explanation, he fired the young prime minister he had
fought so hard to appoint five months ago and named Chernomyrdin as
acting premier in his place. Chernomyrdin was already holding
consultations on the make-up of the new government early Monday,
Russian television reported.
	   The surprise announcement came one week after the Russian
government effectively devalued its national currency, the ruble,
and announced it would restructure the country's short-term debts.
	   The government had been scheduled to announce the terms of
restructuring those debts on Monday. It had already postponed the
announcement for five days under pressure from foreign investors
who fear Russia will offer them a worse deal than Russian banks,
and was expected to delay the decision again.
	   The lower house of parliament was scheduled to meet this week to
consider the Kiriyenko government's anti-crisis measures, including
long-delayed bills to boost government revenues and cut state
spending. It was unclear how that draft legislation would be
affected by Kiriyenko's departure.
	   The government's dismissal came a little more than a week before
Yeltsin is to host U.S. President Bill Clinton at a summit meeting
in Moscow. White House officials with Clinton in Edgartown,
Massachusetts, said the trip would go forward as planned and would
focus on Russia's efforts at economic reform.
	   ``Those policies are not specifically based on personality,''
said P.J. Crowley, spokesman for Clinton's National Security
Council.
	   Kiriyenko is a 36-year-old former banker who had won respect
from Western economists and some Russians even as he failed to stem
the collapse of the Russian stock market and the steady degradation
of the economy.
	   The president, on the last day of a five-week vacation, issued a
terse statement through his press service announcing the changes.
	   Although Chernomyrdin is generally respected in political and
business circles, the sudden change seemed likely to further
undermine confidence in Yeltsin's leadership.
	   Yeltsin has a long history of firing top aides when things
aren't going well. He has fired dozens of ministers during his
years in the Kremlin.
	   ``This is totally consistent with his past strategy of blaming
his government for all the problems in the country,'' said William
Browder, head of Hermitage Capital Management in Moscow. ``It will
be interesting to see whether the Russian public doesn't hold him
responsible this time.''
	   ``It's simply comical,'' said Vladimir Lukin, a leader of the
liberal Yabloko bloc in parliament. The ITAR-Tass news agency
quoted him as saying the decision ``reveals the deep confusion and
uncertainty at the center of executive power.''
	   But Vladimir Ryzhkov, first deputy speaker of the lower house of
parliament and a member of Chernomyrdin's Our Home is Russia party,
said the change would help persuade people that ``the authorities
in Russia are able.
	   ``Our foreign partners and the Russian people need to see
this,'' he told the NTV television station.
	   Chernomyrdin, who headed the Gazprom national gas monopoly
during the Soviet era, was Yeltsin's prime minister and steady
right-hand man from December 1992 until this March, when the
president said Russia needed new, more energetic leadership.
	   Chernomyrdin's government failed to pass comprehensive tax laws,
or stamp out rampant tax evasion among Russian companies.
	   Kiriyenko took the news of his dismissal calmly and continued
working well into the evening, ITAR-Tass reported. At one point, he
left his office to say farewell to striking miners who have been
camped outside the government building all summer, and whom
Kiriyenko had previously ignored.
	   Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov said he welcomed Yeltsin's
decision to fire Kiriyenko, whose government was ``not capable of
working efficiently,'' the Interfax news agency reported. However,
he criticized the reappointment of Chernomyrdin.
	   ``This endeavor is unlikely to succeed since Kiriyenko's
government, which survived just over 100 days, continued what the
former Cabinet was doing,'' Seleznyov was quoted as saying.
	   Russians who heard the news on an otherwise quiet Sunday evening
expressed resignation at the president's mercurial leadership.
	   ``How can I possibly make sense of it?'' asked Sergei Tikhonov,
a sports magazine editor. ``It's impossible. In America, your
leaders give you reasons for things _ here we're told nothing. What
are we supposed to think?''

Thousands protest against Cambodia's Hun Sen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ More than 3,000 people demonstrated
in a Phnom Penh stadium Monday against election fraud, with protest
leaders denouncing Cambodian strongman Hun Sen as a killer.
	   Opposition leader Sam Rainsy called on the Cambodian People's
Party to remove Hun Sen, whom he called ``stupid, a traitor and a
murderer.''
	   Sam Rainsy told protesters at Olympic Stadium they should rally
day and night in front of the National Assembly ``until Hun Sen
steps down. Down with Hun Sen the murderer.''
	   Hun Sen's CPP won 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in the July
26 national election, short of the two thirds majority needed to
form a government. The CPP needs to forge a coalition with one of
the opposition parties.
	   Despite international observers pronouncing the polls free and
fair, the opposition refuses to retract allegations the elections
were marred by massive fraud perpetrated by the CPP.
	   It was the second demonstration against election fraud in as
many days, with 10,000 attending Sunday's rally.
	   Organizers officially canceled Monday's rally late Sunday,
saying they wanted to give the government one more week to address
complaints. Still, over 3,000 people turned out.
	   Sam Rainsy arrived at the stadium early Monday to tell them to
disband, but apparently caught up in the moment, he kept the rally
going for over two hours.
	   ``If our complaints are not settled we will stage another
protest 10 times bigger than yesterday (Sunday),'' he said.
	   Protesters took turns attacking Hun Sen over the microphone,
drawing shrieks of laughter and applause.
	   ``Down (with the) despicable Yuon puppet Hun Sen,'' one woman
cried. Yuon is a derogatory word for Vietnam.
	   The July 26 parliamentary elections were held one year after Hun
Sen ousted Prince Norodom Ranariddh as his co-prime minister in a
violent coup. Hundreds of the prince's supporters were killed in
the months that followed.
	   Hun Sen organized new polls to win back legitimacy and aid lost
after his takeover, but the opposition has accused him of rigging
the process in his favor by stacking the electoral machinery with
his own supporters to ensure victory.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party and Ranariddh's Funcinpec party _ which
together won 58 seats _ have threatened to boycott the new
parliament and block the formation of a government unless their
claims that Hun Sen won by massive fraud are investigated.
	   They have demanded recounts for hundreds of areas, but the Hun
Sen-controlled National Election Committee has dismissed their
complaints as ``baseless.''
	   Several hundred of the Monday protesters marched to the National
Assembly to complain about irregularities in the vote.
	   About 20 police armed with AK-47 rifles awaited the
demonstrators, who plopped themselves in the middle of the road.
	   ``We will bring woven mats, mosquito nets, and pillows and we
will not go anywhere until Hun Sen steps down,'' said Sam Rainsy.
	   In March last year, Sam Rainsy was the apparent target of a
grenade attack when he was leading a demonstration outside
parliament. Sixteen people were killed and more than 100 wounded in
the attack. No one was arrested.
	   Sam Rainsy, whose life was saved when he was shielded by a
bodyguard, said at the time that he suspected Hun Sen, his bitter
political rival, was behind the attack.

Charges of assassination, coup plots abound in troubled Haiti
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL NORTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haiti's ever-fractious political
groups have heightened their war of charges and counter-charges
while the country wallows in instability and poverty.
	   In the latest of many unsubstantiated claims, former police
chief Dany Toussaint has accused two senators of trying to kill
former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide this spring by ramming a
car into the presidential limousine.
	   There also have been arrests of people accused of plotting to
restore former dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier, and claims that
feared thugs of the ex-military dictator have regrouped.
	   ``We're on the threshold of a coup d'etat,'' Toussaint warned
recently.
	   Last week, police arrested seven people they said were found
with arms and uniforms of the Tonton Macoute militia that supported
the 29-year Duvalier family dictatorship, which was toppled in a
popular uprising in 1986.
	   And last month, the New York magazine Emerge published an
interview with exiled militia leader Emmanuel Constant, who claimed
that fighters for the Front for the Advancement and Progress of
Haiti _ disbanded when the United States invaded four years ago _
were still active.
	   Police have arrested 16 people for plotting subversive acts in
the past month, but many Haitians wonder whether the charges are
well-founded or an excuse to suppress dissent as the Caribbean
nation flounders.
	   Haiti has not had an effective government since June 1997, when
Premier Rosny Smarth resigned to protest partial legislative
elections he said were loaded in favor of Aristide candidates.
	   The power struggle between Smarth's Struggling People's
Organization party and the Lavalas Family Party of Aristide, who is
expected to seek re-election in 2000, has blocked the approval of a
new premier.
	   Western nations have frozen payment of millions of dollars in
assistance and the U.S. Congress is threatening to cut all aid.
	   Haitians, already the poorest people in the Western hemisphere,
hoped their lot would improve after the United States sent troops
in 1994 to disband the military that had ousted Aristide in 1990.
But political instability and poverty continued under Aristide and
his hand-picked successor, Rene Preval.
	   On Thursday, Toussaint told reporters that two senators
attempted to kill Aristide in April on the road to the southern
city of Port Salut.
	   ``Filled with armed men, the vehicle of Sen. Paul Denis rammed
into the presidential limousine,'' he said. Aristide had traveled
by helicopter, which the senators did not know, he said.
	   Toussaint also accused Senate President Edgard Leblanc, saying
he appeared on the scene minutes afterward with armed bodyguards.
Both senators belong to Smarth's party.
	   Aristide has said nothing about the incident, which Denis
described as ``a banal accident.'' He asked why Toussaint had
waited four months to accuse them.
	   The charges of plots, he said, ``are scarecrows, designed to
frighten people away from the truth.''

Salmon scarce, anger abundant in British Columbia fishing towns
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT HARDY, British Columbia (AP) _ The fishing fleet bobs at
the town wharf like a postcard come to life, giving no hint of the
anger and despair building among those who sail the boats.
	   They are angry at American fishermen, accusing them of
overfishing. They rail at Canada's government, viewing it as
callous and ill-informed.
	   Above all, they are bitter that their way of life _ as
self-reliant, small-town, salmon fishermen _ seems almost on the
verge of extinction, much like coho salmon.
	   ``severely limited all salmon fishing
along Canada's Pacific coast to protect the endangered coho. Fish
stocks have slumped from a variety of causes, from unusually warm
water from El Nino disrupting the Pacific food chain to erosion on
logged slopes choking salmon spawning beds inland.
	   And for the first time, salmon raised on fish farms is
outselling salmon caught in the wild.
	   The result, in towns like Port Hardy, has been devastating, so
wrenching, in fact, that suicide rates have jumped.
	   ``Fish stocks come and go, and fishing communities learn to roll
with the punches,'' said Perkovich, 41. ``But what we're
experiencing now is vastly different than what anyone has
experienced before. This is the toughest.''
	   There are roughly 3,000 boats in British Columbia's commercial
salmon fleet. With stocks so low, about 1,200 owners accepted a
government offer to sit out the season this summer for a payment of
6,500 Canadian dollars, or about dlrs 4,300.
	   In the Port Hardy area, only 120 boats _ half the normal turnout
_ showed up this month when a limited salmon catch was authorized.
	   The town also has been hurt by a slump in the forestry industry.
Mayor Russ Hellberg says the jobless rate this summer _ normally
the busiest time of year _ has been about 20 percent.
	   ``It was pretty good living up here in the '80s, but glory days
will never be back,'' Hellberg said.
	   Fishermen and politicians in the coastal towns accept the need
for radical changes in the salmon fishery. They know the fleet and
the catch must be reduced, but they want a say in the
decision-making and worry that large, corporate-owned boats from a
few major ports will dominate after the industry is restructured.
	   One of the government's strategies is to buy back the licenses
of several hundred boat owners. Perkovich says the process amounts
to ``a hostile takeover'' _ struggling independent owners will
decide the buyout is their best option, while the corporate boats
will remain in business.
	   ``Communities like Port Hardy won't benefit,'' he said. ``There
will be fish at their doorstep, and they won't benefit.''
	   So bleak is the mood that the provincial government formed a
special suicide-prevention team earlier this year after suicide
rates jumped in coastal towns.
	   Port Hardy has been one of the hardest-hit communities, with
four suicides and about 30 suicide attempts in the first half of
the year. The victims were all men between 20 and 50, the coroner's
office says.
	   Yet Anthony Sutton, a former salmon-boat crewman now struggling
to get a federal license to harvest mussels, said there is defiance
as well as despair.
	   ``There's almost an under-siege mentality,'' said Sutton, 40.
``There's a fighting spirit _ a feeling of `We're not going to move
to Vancouver and get a job in data processing.'''
	   Last year, the prime targets of the fishermen's wrath were the
Americans. At one point, Canadian fishing boats blockaded a ferry
from Alaska to drive home the claim that Americans were taking too
many salmon.
	   This year, though some anti-American bitterness lingers, the
principal villain is the Canadian government.
	   Port Hardy fishermen were outraged when federal officials failed
to attend an emergency meeting Aug. 9.
	   ``Our livelihoods, our lives, are at stake _ and their phones
are off the hook,'' said fisherman Dan Edwards.
	   Perkovich, who said more money is needed for retraining
out-of-work fishermen, said federal authorities seem biased for
recreational and corporate boats at the expense of small coastal
towns.
	   With a trace of disgust, he showed a visitor a federal
questionnaire that at one point asks out-of-work fishermen: ``Are
you past the anger-mourning stage?''
	   ``We're bordering right now on outright civil disobedience,'' he
said.

Lack of jobs sends Singapore graduates back to school
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ With fewer job prospects in the midst of the
Asian economic crisis, recent Singaporean university graduates are
returning to school for higher degrees, putting off their entry
into the work force until better times.
	   ``We are seeing quite a number of students who, because of the
economic crisis, are staying on to further their studies,'' Lily
Kong, a vice-dean at the National University of Singapore Graduate
School of Arts and Social Sciences, was quoted as saying Monday.
	   Singapore's unemployment rate in June was 2.3 percent, up from
2.2 percent in March. Government leaders have said it could reach 7
percent next year, with more than 120,000 people out of work, if a
recession sets in.
	   Enrollment for graduate school courses at Singapore's two
universities has increased dramatically this year, compared to the
last two years, The Straits Times reported.
	   At the National University's Graduate School of Science, there
were 1,011 applications for advanced study this year, a 72 percent
increase over 1996, when there were 588 applications.
	   Applications to the Nanyang Technical University increased to
3,000 this year, up by 50 percent from 1996.
	   The newspaper said recent graduates have been taking part-time
or lower paying jobs because of fierce competition with laid-off
and experienced workers in the dwindling job market.

Japanese police battle obesity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese police have begun a pitched battle against
an enemy in their own ranks: obesity.
	   Leading the fight are Japan's finest on the northern island of
Hokkaido. After routine check ups revealed about 60 percent of
officers were overweight, headquarters began handing out ``red
cards'' in June to those needing exercise, a police spokesman said
Monday.
	   It also announced a campaign to encourage officers to walk
10,000 steps a day for the next 100 days _ or one million steps by
the end of summer.
	   ``There are obvious problems to having overweight officers,''
said spokesman Yoshiharu Nakano. ``They can't carry out their jobs
as well.''
	   Police departments in at least six other prefectures have also
identified obesity as a problem and are taking steps to get
officers back in shape, Kyodo News reported Sunday.
	   The National Police Agency refused to comment on the report.

Former Thai premier praises minister who tried to topple him
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's former prime minister Prem
Tinsulananda celebrated his 78th birthday Monday by praising the
leadership of the interior minister, the man who tried to depose
him in a 1981 coup d'etat.
	   Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart presented Prem with the
traditional gift of floral bouquets at his home on behalf of the
government of Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai.
	   Prem, a former general who is privy councillor to Thailand's
constitutional monarch King Bhumibol Adulyadej, served as prime
minister from 1980-88.
	   ``I know these are tough times and that all of us have to do
sacrifice,'' Prem said, referring to Thailand's economic crisis.
``But I believe the leadership of Sanan will help guide us through
this troubled period.''
	   Sanan is one of the most powerful members of the ruling Democrat
Party.
	   In April 1981, Sanan was part of a clique of officers called the
``Young Turks'' that attempted to topple Prem in a coup d'etat.
	   The coup collapsed when the royal family came out in support of
Prem.
	   Sanan was imprisoned for his role in the attempted takeover.

Indonesians protest outside U.S. Embassy in anti-bombing rally
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - About 50 demonstrators rallied outside
the U.S. Embassy on Monday to protest the U.S. missile strikes on
alleged terrorist targets in Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   The protesters said the United Nations should censure U.S.
President Bill Clinton for what they called criminal acts.
	   Clinton ordered the attacks last week in retaliation for the
Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in which
some 270 people were killed.
	   ``We condemn the terrorist action against the two U.S.
Embassies, but we also abhor what America has done in Sudan and
Afghanistan,'' read a statement issued by the protesters. They
identified themselves as members of the Indonesian Anti-Terrorist
Committee.
	   Dozens of police stood guard outside the embassy gates, but the
protest was peaceful.
	   Some Muslim groups around the world view the U.S. strikes as an
attack on their faith. Reaction has been muted in predominately
Muslim Indonesia, and President B.J. Habibie has said the U.S.
retaliation was not an assault on Islam.

Police hunt for gang which destroyed Test cricket pitches
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Police in southern Sri Lanka are
looking for a gang which destroyed 10 cricket pitches at a brand
new international cricket stadium last week, a local newspaper
reported Monday.
	   One gang member, Lal Amarasinghe, was remanded till Sept. 3
after his arrest over the weekend, giving police time to gather
evidence, the Daily News said.
	   The three-member gang broke into the Galle International Cricket
stadium on Thursday night, dug up the pitches and poured engine oil
on them.
	   Police believe the vandalism is the result of rivalry between
two gangs for control of gambling operations in the area.
	   In June the stadium became the world's newest Test cricket
venue, when New Zealand played a match versus Sri Lanka.

Thai farmers break off negotiations with the government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai farmers organization has broken
off talks with the government, accusing the authorities of
insincerity in solving their longstanding problems, the group said
Monday.
	   The decision to end talks came after three days of meetings by
over 120 community leaders throughout the country, said Pasittiporn
Kan-onsri, a senior advisor to the Forum of the Poor, the farmers
group.
	   He said the organization will continue its campaign to educate
rural people about their rights and the lack of sincerity from the
government.
	   ``We will also be calling on all political parties to make known
their agenda on the plight of Thailand's poor,'' he said.
	   He blasted the government of Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai for
suspending the 1.2 billion baht (dlrs 29 million) compensation
payment for villagers who have been forced to relocate because of
construction of state projects.
	   The Forum is also calling on the government to come up with
clear-cut measures on granting ownership rights to villagers who
have lived on land without deeds for generations.
	   The Forum will submit a petition on the issue to the president
of Parliament in two months after collecting at least 150,000
signatures.
	   Last year, the Forum organized nearly 20,000 poor rural people
to camp outside of the executive office building for three months
demanding action on a range of issues from the government of former
Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh.

Chernomyrdin back atop Russian government, Kiriyenko out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yeltsin formally nominating Chernomyrdin,
Chernomyrdin meeting with regional leaders, fresh Chernomyrdin
quote. Will be led after Chernomyrdin-Yeltsin meeting, scheduled
for Monday morning. &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Dumped unceremoniously five months ago, former
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was back in power Monday and
facing one of the worst crises to confront Russia since the Soviet
collapse.
	   President Boris Yeltsin dismissed the government of Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko on Sunday, displaying a capriciousness
that has begun to worry people here and abroad.
	   Without explanation, he fired the young prime minister he had
fought so hard to appoint five months ago and named Chernomyrdin as
acting premier in his place. Yeltsin forwarded the nomination to
the parliament early Monday morning, his press service said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Chernomyrdin was already holding consultations on the make-up of
the new government early Monday. He spoke with regional leaders,
including Gen. Alexander Lebed, the presidential hopeful who is
governor of the Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia, and the governors of
the Perm region and of the republic of Tatarstan, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   The surprise announcement came one week after the Russian
government effectively devalued its national currency, the ruble,
and announced it would restructure the country's short-term debts.
	   The government had been scheduled to announce the terms of
restructuring those debts on Monday. It had already postponed the
announcement for five days under pressure from foreign investors
who fear Russia will offer them a worse deal than Russian banks,
and was expected to delay the decision again.
	   The lower house of parliament was scheduled to meet this week to
consider the Kiriyenko government's anti-crisis measures, including
long-delayed bills to boost government revenues and cut state
spending. It was unclear how that draft legislation would be
affected by Kiriyenko's departure.
	   ``The first thing I will do as acting head of government is to
analyze the situation on Russia's financial and stock markets,''
Chernomyrdin was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency.

Police crack down on ring making fake anti-impotence drug
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Police in southern Vietnam confirmed
reports Monday that they have cracked a ring producing counterfeit
medicines, including the anti-impotence drug Viagra.
	   Six people were arrested Aug. 16, when police confiscated 1,000
fake Viagra tablets, 10,000 counterfeit Viagra logos and 25,000
sham logos of other medicines that are supposed to improve sexual
performance, the Labor newspaper reported Monday.
	   The ring was uncovered when police in Long An province on July
17 intercepted Pham Van Luy and seized 25,000 tablets of Glifanan,
banned by the Health Ministry since 1992, as Luy was to sell them
to Cambodian dealers.
	   Luy's reported confession led to the Aug. 11 arrest of Le Quang
Minh, who allegedly sold him the banned medicine. Minh's subsequent
confession led to the arrests of his six associates.
	   Minh allegedly told police that they had sold about a ton of
fake medicine to Cambodians.
	   The Health Ministry has yet to allow the use of Viagra in
Vietnam, although it is available at inflated prices, mainly in
Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.

China moves people out of harm's way as Yangtze rises again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese flood control officials evacuated areas
along the upper Yangtze River Monday as waters surged to their
highest levels in over a month of disastrous flooding.
	   Yangtze tributaries swelled by torrential rains that killed at
least 19 people in southwestern Sichuan province last week
converged near the city of Chongqing over the weekend and swelled
into a new flood crest, the river's seventh since early July.
	   Officials warned that record high waters _ up to 4.7 meters (15
1/2 feet) above the emergency line _ would lash the upper Yangtze
for the next two days, the state-run China Youth Daily reported.
	   To prevent more casualties in the Yangtze's worst flood season
in 44 years, all people and movable property were ordered away from
a 600-kilometer (350-mile) stretch of the river, the newspaper
said.
	   As the latest flood crest bears down on central China, slightly
receding waters from the last surge of flood waters opened cracks
and undermined waterlogged dikes that protect vital cities and
fertile farmland, state media reported.
	   More than 2,000 people have died in flooding nationwide and
millions others left homeless, according to two-week-old official
figures. Government officials were due to release revised tallies
Tuesday.
	   In an indication that the death count would climb, the tightly
controlled state media stopped using the official figure and
reported deaths in the ``thousands.''
	   To care for the victims and contain any political fallout,
Chinese leaders ordered a crackdown on profiteering and misuse of
relief donations. Chinese have contributed 2.7 billion yuan (dlrs
326 million) to relief efforts, more than ten times the amount of
aid already distributed by flood control officials.
	   The State Council, China's Cabinet, warned that fraud seemed to
be following the flow of donations and ordered stricter supervision
of funds. Failure to stop the corruption could ``frustrate normal
social order,'' the State Council said in a decree carried by the
official Xinhua News Agency.
	   Major national newspapers highlighted the arrest of company
manager Liu Xiaoqiang in northeast Harbin city for making and
selling substandard life vests. He sold 1,080 of them in
flood-struck Harbin before being caught.
	   While the threat of renewed flooding reemerged along the
Yangtze, officials declared imminent victory in the north in saving
the country's largest oil field from inundation.
	   Twenty thousand soldiers completed construction of a new dike to
protect the Daqing oil field from the raging Nen and Songhua
rivers, the China Daily reported. Built after the rivers breached
three other levees, the dike stands a meter (3 feet) above the
flood waters.

AOC seeks upgrade of sports doping penalties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian Olympic Committee chief John
Coates has called on governments to raise the penalties for serious
sports drug offences to match penalties for dangerous narcotics
such as heroin.
	   If the AOC plan is adopted, those guilty of trafficking
commercial quantities of sports drugs such as anabolic steroids
could face life imprisonment.
	   Coates released a report Monday which he has sent to national
and state governments and leading sports figures including
International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch.
The document backed, with details, a call by Australian IOC Kevan
Gosper last week in Lausanne for governments to join the war
against sports drugs.
	   ``Australia has an opportunity to lead the world in this regard
with the staging of the 2000 Olympics in Sydney and the current
international focus on doping in sport,'' Coates told a news
conference. ``Now is the time to act. If we're to ensure that the
2000 (Sydney) Olympics are not remembered as the drug games
immediate action is required.''
	   The AOC has discussed its plan with the Sydney Olympic
Organizing Committee and with IOC members Gosper and Phil Coles. It
sent a copy of its proposal to Prime Minister John Howard and the
leaders of all Australian states and territories.
	   The AOC has focussed on three areas of sports drugs and says
penalties for possession, manufacture and trafficking of these
drugs should draw the same penalties as serious narcotics such as
heroin and cocaine.
	   Coates said the three hard drug classes were anabolic androgenic
steroids, Beta 2 agonists (other than asthma medications) and
peptide and glycoprotein hormones and analogues.
	   The current ceiling for fines for importation of sports drugs is
about U.S. dlrs 30,000 while the maximum for narcotics is life.
Chinese swimmer Yuan Yuan attempted to illegally import enough
growth hormones to supply 20 athletes before the world
championships earlier this year but escaped without a fine and was
allowed to enter the country.
	   Under the AOC plan Yuan would have faced a maximum penalty of 25
years jail.
	   ``She should have at least faced the courts,'' Coates said.
	   The AOC report said a magistrate in the Victoria state recently
applied the maximum allowable peanlty of Aust dlrs 5,000 (U.S. dlrs
3,000) on two men caught importing steroids worth Aust dlrs 900,000
(U.S. dlrs 525,000).
	   ``That makes it a worthwhile risk for these dealers to deal in
the sports drugs instead of risking the penalties from narcotics,''
said AOC lawyer Simon Rofe.
	   Rofe said the governments could add the hard sports drugs into
the same category as narcotics within legislation. He said the laws
could be drafted within a month, with the biggest delay being
getting the laws into the parliamentary agenda.

Asian markets slide on weakened yen, Russia turmoil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets mostly fell early Monday,
pushed down by a weakened Japanese currency, political turmoil in
Russia, retreating markets in Latin America and Wall Street's
losses last Friday.
	   Japan's yen and stocks tumbled as investors scrambled to buy the
U.S. dollar, regarded as a safe haven to park money amid
international uncertainties.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Sunday dismantled his Cabinet
and reappointed former Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin, who was
fired five months ago, to pull Russia out of one of its worst
economic crises since the Soviet collapse.
	   The move sparked fears that the International Monetary Fund _
already bailing out South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand _ will not
have enough funds to recue Russia, or will be unable to support
bigger bailouts for member countries if a new regional financial
crisis breaks out.
	   At midday in Tokyo, the dollar bought 145.06 yen, up 2.12 yen
from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its New York rate of
144.91 yen late Friday.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped below the
psychologically-significant 15,000-point level, falling 408.69
points, or 2.67 percent, to 14,889.51 at the midday close. On
Friday, the average fell 93.21 points, or 0.61 percent.
	   ``It's yet to be seen whether the market has already factored in
Russia's instability,'' said Ryohei Muramatsu, treasury manager at
Commerzbank in Tokyo.
	   In Jakarta, the JSX Composite Index opened down 4.7 percent at
370.000 points, as investors dumped stocks of companies related to
the banks closed by the government last week.
	   To revive the crippled banking sector, the government announced
Friday that four state-owned banks will be merged, the several
others frozen, nationalized or recapitalized.
	   In Kuala Lumpur, the key Composite Index dropped 2.6 percent to
315.7 points, as investors remained cautious over new economic
measures the government says it will introduce to help the
country's embattled economy.
	   Last Thursday, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad urged Malaysian
to be prepared when the government announces the new economic
measures, but didn't say what they will be, or when the package
will be presented.
	   In Taiwan, the Weighted Price index plunged 3.5 percent to close
at a 17-month low of 6,957.75 points, amid concerns about the
deterioration in the global economy and listed companies lowering
their earnings forecasts for 1998.
	   In Manila, the key Philippine Stock Exchange index finished 3.6
percent lower at 1,323.11. Singapore's key index, the Straits Times
Industrials Index, closed the morning session 2 percent lower at
914.58 points.
	   Bangkok's Stock Exchange of Thailand index also fell 2 percent
to 234.02 points.
	   In South Korea, a compromise reached by management and union
officials of strike-bound Hyundai Motor Co., which ended a 36-day
labor dispute at the nation's largest automaker, failed to lift the
stock market.
	   The Korea Composite Stock Price Index opened down 2.09 points to
303.24.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index closed the choppy
morning session just 5.55 points lower at 7,255.06.
	   The government was seen intervening for the sixth consecutive
trading session in an attempt to fend off speculators.

Brown out for season
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ All Black prop Olo Brown has been
ruled out of the rest of the 1998 rugby season after suffering a
serious back injury during the tri-nations test against South
Africa in Durban on Aug. 15.
	   Brown complained of back soreness after the test match and the
injury was diagnosed Monday as a disc prolapse.
	   The loss of Brown was covered last week when Otago tighthead
Kees Meeuws was added to the All Blacks squad for this Saturday's
Bledisloe Cup test against Australia in Sydney.
	   All Blacks coach John Hart said the loss was yet another blow in
an injury-plagued season.
	   ``It's tough for Olo and tough for us, especially when he was
part of such a great scrum performance in Durban,'' Hart said.
``Olo's been a real stalwart throughout our rebuilding phase and we
will miss him enormously in Sydney.''

Pro-democracy demonstration erupts in Myanmar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ More than 80 pro-democracy activists
spilled into the streets of Yangon as the first protest in nearly
two years against military rule erupted on Monday.
	   Waving red flags with a yellow fighting peacock _ the symbol of
the Myanmar democracy movement and the political party of
opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi _ the protesters blocked traffic
at the Hledan Junction near Yangon University.
	   ``Down with the totalitarian government,'' they chanted. ``Our
cause must succeed.''
	   Others sang the national anthem.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military
since 1962. The army brutally crushed street protests during a
nationwide democracy uprising in 1988, gunning down as many as
3,000.
	   The authorities, caught unaware of Monday's protest, had yet to
send riot police to break up the demonstration. Angry motorists
honked their horns in frustration.
	   Many of the protesters appeared young, and were perhaps
university students.
	   The last street protests took place in Dec. 1996 and were
organized by students demanding more civil rights and the right to
form a student union.
	   The military used water cannon to break up those demonstrations.
It later sentenced dozens of student leaders and members of the
youth wing of Suu Kyi's party to long prison terms.
	   Monday's demonstration erupted as political tensions were rising
in Myanmar.
	   Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner, is in the 13th day
of a roadside standoff with the military over its restrictions on
her right to travel freely.
	   Her party, the National League for Democracy, has said it will
convene the parliament elected in 1990, after the military refused
to meet the NLD's Aug. 21 deadline to do so.
	   The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in parliament but the
military refused to honor the result. It has warned the NLD that
any attempt to convene parliament is illegal and will jeopardize
possible talks with military leaders.
	   The military has also prevented doctors from treating Suu Kyi,
who is reportedly suffering from kidney problems, low blood
pressure, dizziness and urinary tract problems.
	   She and three colleagues are encamped in a van on a bridge 32
kilometers (19 miles) west of Yangon in their fourth attempt in two
months to travel to the city of Bassein to meet party members.

Dollar soars on Russian turmoil, Tokyo stock prices drop
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stock, mid-afternoon bond and currency;
Okura and Co. in 8th graf takes an ampersand

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The dollar soared against the yen Monday after
political turmoil in Russia prompted world investors to seek a safe
haven in the U.S. currency. Tokyo stocks tumbled.
	   The dollar bought 144.69 yen in mid-afternoon trading, up 1.75
yen from late Friday in Tokyo but below its New York rate of 144.91
yen late Friday.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average dropped below the psychologically-significant
15,000-point level, falling 309.84 points, or 2.03 percent, to
close at 14,988.36. On Friday, the average fell 93.21 points, or
0.61 percent.
	   Both Tokyo stocks and the yen tumbled after Russian President
Boris Yeltsin dismissed his government Sunday, traders said.
	   In the surprise announcement, Yeltsin reappointed former Prime
Minister Victor Chernomyrdin, who was fired five months ago, to
pull Russia out of one of its worst economic crises since the
Soviet collapse.
	   The news boosted the dollar, often regarded a safe place to park
money in times of international unrest, against world currencies
like the yen and the German mark.
	   ``It's yet to be seen whether the market has already factored in
Russia's instability or the mark will be sold further on a view
that Chernomyrdin's appointment will add to the uncertainty,'' said
Ryohei Muramatsu, treasury manager at Commerzbank in Tokyo.
	   The yen also suffered from concerns about the health of Japan's
economy. On Friday, the medium-sized trading company Okura and Co.
filed for bankruptcy with debts totaling 257.7 billion yen (dlrs
1.8 billion), becoming Japan's third-largest corporate failure this
year.
	   Political uncertainty also faces the government's plans to
stabilize the nation's shaky banking system. While Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi has promised more than 500 billion yen (dlrs 3.4
billion) to help ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. merge
with Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co., opponents have vowed to derail
the effort.
	   ``Investors are cautious about whether Parliament will smoothly
pass bills designed to restructure the financial system, including
bills that would allow the use of public funds to support LTCB,''
said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of the stock division at Chuo
Securities Co.
	   The prospect of delays in the bank-clean up bills weighed on the
stock market, where banks are the market's biggest components.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange dropped 18.21 points, or 1.55
percent, to 1,158.30. The TOPIX closed down 5.16 points, or 0.44
percent, on Friday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.135 percent from Friday's finish of 1.180 percent,
driving its price up to 112.19 yen from 111.87 yen.

Australian government under pressure for inquiry into Timor deaths
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS final four grafs to UPDATE with department and foreign
minister comments &QL; 
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The Australian government Monday
faced renewed pressure to start an inquiry into the killing of five
journalists during Indonesia's 1975 invasion of East Timor, after a
newspaper reported that the foreign service knew the attack was
coming.
	   In a front-page story Monday, The Sydney Morning Herald said
Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has for 23
years covered up foreknowledge of the Indonesian invasion and its
failure to warn the newsmen.
	   Citing government documents and accounts by Australian
officials, the paper said the department was given a detailed
briefing by Indonesian officials on their plans for their attack on
the village of Balibo three days before it occurred.
	   The report says the attack was part of an invasion by about
3,200 Indonesian troops which intended to wrest control of all East
Timor, and not a border skirmish as the Australian department
portrays it.
	   The paper reported that the department knew the Australians were
outside East Timor's capital, Dili, but made no effort to check if
any Australians were in the attack zone or to warn the journalists'
employers of the attack.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, in
1975 and annexed it the next year. Australia recognizes the
annexation, but the United Nations does not.
	   Reporter Malcolm Rennie, 28, and cameraman Brian Peters, 29,
both British citizens; reporter Greg Shackleton, 27, and soundman
Tony Stewart, 21, both Australians; and cameraman Gary Cunningham,
27, a New Zealander, were killed in the attack on Balibo on Oct.
16.
	   Another Australian reporter, Roger East, was killed in the East
Timorese capital, Dili, on Dec. 8, 1975.
	   Widow Shirley Shackleton said on Monday that she believed all
along that there had been a government cover-up, and renewed her
calls for a judicial inquiry into the deaths.
	   Meanwhile, the Australian section of the Geneva-based
International Commission of Jurists condemned a 1996 inquiry into
the deaths by former government lawyer Tom Sherman, saying it had
not done enough.
	   The group is also pressing for a judicial inquiry.
	   In a statement, the department denied any cover-up and said
Sherman's inquiry had been given access to all government documents
relating to the deaths.
	   ``The deaths have been the subject of intensive scrutiny during
the years since 1975,'' the statement said.
	   ``In these circumstances, the suggestion of a departmental
cover-up is entirely unfounded.''
	   Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said that to the best of his
knowledge there was no cover-up, but said he had ordered the
department to systematically review the allegations made in the
newspaper report.

Two more bags with stimulants found floating off Japan coast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Police in western Japan said Monday they found two
more bags containing illegal stimulant drugs floating in waters off
the coast of southwestern Japan.
	   Each of the two bags picked up separately in Tosa Bay contained
20 kilograms (44 pounds) of stimulants, Kochi prefecture, or state,
police spokesman Kyusaku Nishioka said, based on a preliminary
analysis.
	   Police estimated the combined street value of the stimulants at
2.4 billion yen (dlrs 16.7 million), media reports said.
	   On Sunday, a pair of similar bags, also containing 20 kilograms
(44 pounds) each, were found in nearby waters by a local fisherman
and police later seized them, Nishioka said.
	   He said 250 police personnel _ joined by two coast guard
vessels, several rubber boats, 30 local fishing boats and two
aircraft _ were searching the Pacific coastal area in Kochi
prefecture, about 625 kilometers (387 miles), southwest of Tokyo.
	   The contents of the stimulants were to be analyzed later by
experts to determine what kind of drugs were found, Nishioka said.
	   Police suspect the drugs, all in polyethylene bags, might have
been dumped into the waters in a smuggling attempt.
	   On Aug. 15, a local junior high school student in a boat
reported that about 10 mysterious bags were floating in the area.

Police raid Muslim rebel hideout, rescues kidnapped doctor, aide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) - Police raided a suspected Muslim
rebel hideout in a southern Philippine island and rescued a
kidnapped female doctor and an aide from four days of captivity,
police said Monday.
	   The surprised extremist Abu Sayyaf rebels abandoned their
captives after a brief gun battle Saturday on Tapiantana island, a
few kilometers (miles) south of this port city, said regional
police chief Dominador Resos.
	   Resos said the raiding policemen found Dr. Placida Ballan and an
aide in an abandoned rebel hut. The two were kidnapped Aug. 18 in
Sumipsip town in nearby Basilan island, a known rebel lair.
	   The Abu Sayyaf, which means ``Father of the Executioner,'' is
the more militant of two Muslim rebel groups fighting the
government. The government has not officially started peace talks
with the Abu Sayyaf.
	   Police are closely monitoring the group for its alleged links
with international terrorists.
	   Last week, police alerted security against possible terrorist
attacks in the southern Philippines following bomb explosions
outside U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Tanzania.
	   In 1995, the group was accused of killing 50 people and razing
the town center of Ipil in Zamboanga del Sur province.
	   The group also has been suspected of involvement in bombing
attacks. It announced its formation in 1991 by bombing the
missionary ship Doulos, killing a New Zealander and a Swede and
injuring 30 other missionaries.
	   The largest Muslim rebel group, the Moro National Liberation
Front, signed a peace pact with the government in 1996. The other
group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, is scheduled to begin
peace talks with the government this week.

America's Unocal will invest dlrs 1.4 billion in Thai gas fields
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Unocal Thailand Ltd., a unit of Unocal
Corp., plans to invest dlrs 1.4 billion during the next five years
on natural gas exploration and production in the Gulf of Thailand,
the company said Monday.
	   Brian Marcotte, president of Unocal Thailand, said the main
investment would be for development of the Pailin gas field.
	   During the first phase of the Pailin development, dlrs 400
million will be injected for installation of a central processing
platform, five well-head platforms and a living unit. Another dlrs
200 million will be for project development after the platform
installation.
	   The platform installation will start in September. The company
expects to commence producing gas around next July.
	   The remaining investment budget will be allocated for the second
phase of the Pailin gas field development, which includes
installing another eight platforms as well as the development of 11
gas fields in the Gulf of Thailand.
	   Unocal plans to drill 145 wells per year for its 11 gas fields
in the Gulf of Thailand.
	   Pailin gas field is 35 percent-owned by Unocal Thailand, which
is also an operator of the project. PTT Exploration and Production
PCL holds a 45 percent stake, Amerada Hess International
Exploration 15 percent and Moeco Thai Oil Development Co., an
affiliate of Mitsui and Co., 5 percent.

Officials: More flexibility for Singapore dollar policy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; FOR RELEASE AT 0800 GMT, AUG. 24, TIME SET BY SOURCE

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Monetary Authority of Singapore, the
country's de facto central bank, said Monday it will continue to
manage the Singapore dollar with more flexibility as currencies
across Southeast Asia grow more volatile.
	   In its annual report, the MAS said its primary policy goal is to
maintain price stability and confidence in the Singapore dollar
while safeguarding export competitiveness.
	   Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said Sunday night that the
depreciation of the Singapore dollar is not a solution in the
current currency crisis.
	   The monetary authority report said, ``Given the volatility and
uncertainty stemming from the regional crisis, (the) MAS has
managed the exchange rate of the Singapore dollar with greater
flexibility.''
	   It said that despite a sharp decline in the Singapore dollar
against the U.S. dollar, on a trade-weighted basis the Singapore
currency has appreciated slightly since the regional crisis erupted
in July 1997.
	   ``The economy's overall competitiveness, as measured by the real
effective exchange rate, was relatively stable in 1997, thanks to
higher manufacturing productivity growth, which has kept
Singapore's unit labor cost increases lower than in our major
trading partners,'' the report said.
	   At the beginning of 1997, the Singapore economy was already
under pressure from a slump in the global electronics sector, the
MAS said, and the crisis made it more difficult to predict the
extent and duration of the slowdown.
	   The country's strong economic fundamentals kept the Singapore
dollar from falling as low as other regional currencies, the report
said.
	   ``Given the lingering uncertainty from the regional currency
crisis, (the) MAS will continue to manage the Singapore dollar
flexibly against a trade-weighted basket of currencies,'' it said.

Pro-democracy demonstration erupts in Myanmar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New thruou to UPDATE with protesters asking other people to
join them in the streets, military no where to be seen.

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ More than 150 student pro-democracy
activists spilled into the streets of Yangon Monday in the first
demonstration against the military junta in nearly two years.
	   Blocking traffic at Hledan Junction near Yangon University, the
protesters waved red flags with a yellow fighting peacock, the
symbol of the democracy movement and the political party of
opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   ``Down with the totalitarian government!'' the demonstrators
chanted. ``Our cause must succeed!''
	   Others sang the national anthem.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military
since 1962. The army brutally crushed protests during a nationwide
democracy uprising in 1988, gunning down as many as 3,000 people.
	   Monday's demonstration erupted as political tensions were rising
in Myanmar. Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner, was in the
13th day of a roadside standoff with the military outside Yangon
over its restrictions on her right to travel freely.
	   Her party, the National League for Democracy, also has said it
will convene the parliament elected in 1990, after the military
refused to meet the NLD's Aug. 21 deadline to do so.
	   The party won 82 percent of the seats in parliament but the
military refused to honor the result. It has warned the NLD that
any attempt to convene parliament is illegal and will jeopardize
possible talks with military leaders.
	   The protest Monday began shortly after noon when a young man ran
to the middle of the junction in downtown Yangon and began clapping
his hands. About 80 protesters then joined him.
	   After a short while, the crowd swelled to more than 150 as more
students marched into the intersection. They asked onlookers to
take part, and cheered when a Buddhist monk joined in.
	   The young protesters distributed pamphlets signed by the Yangon
Students Union that said:
	   ``The student union fully supports the NLD demand for a
parliament, and we urge the public to fight for the restoration of
a civilian government to replace the authoritarian regime.''
	   Student unions have been illegal in Myanmar since the military
seized power in 1962. Students have traditionally been at the
forefront of the Myanmar independence movements and the struggle
for democracy.
	   The authorities, apparently caught unaware of Monday's protest,
didn't immediately send riot police to break up the demonstration.
Angry motorists honked their horns in frustration.
	   The last street protests in Myanmar took place in December 1996,
and were organized by students demanding more civil rights and the
right to form a student union.
	   The military used water cannon to break up those demonstrations.
It later sentenced dozens of student leaders and members of the
youth wing of Suu Kyi's party to long prison terms.
	   Meanwhile, the military has prevented doctors from treating Suu
Kyi, who is reportedly suffering from kidney problems, low blood
pressure, dizziness and a urinary tract infection during her
standoff.
	   She and three colleagues are encamped in a van on a bridge 32
kilometers (20 miles) west of Yangon in their fourth attempt in two
months to travel to the city of Bassein to meet party members.

Sleepy Paris in summertime is more awake than in the past
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ From caffeine-free diet drinks to oversized
envelopes, a lot is missing this month from the shelves of Paris
shops _ if they're open at all.
	   But the penury isn't what it once was when, come Aug. 1, the
French would pack up and flee the capital in droves.
	   Many still do, of course, but statistics show that the French _
for whom ``les conges annuels'' or, paid vacation, is something of
a national institution _ are taking shorter summer holidays.
	   Gone are the days when Parisians would shutter their apartments
and bundle off to the seaside, mountains or country home for four
straight weeks _ or more, if they could afford it.
	   ``The French are staggering their vacations more than in the
past,'' said Marie-Anne Brignol, a spokeswoman for the French
Office of Tourism. ``They go away for shorter periods of time in
the summer, but they're taking more vacations during the year.''
	   Don't expect the French to relinquish a single moment of the
paid holidays they've enjoyed since 1936, when the government
granted all salaried workers the right to two weeks paid leave.
	   Today, they get a minimum of five weeks off _ the most in Europe
_ and can take four weeks consecutively.
	   According to a report by the Tourism Ministry, two out of three
French went on holiday last year _ 57 percent of them during July
or August.
	   But with the growing awareness that closing down in August may
be counterproductive, many employers are encouraging workers to
stay on the job in summer and take their holidays off-season.
	   The French media, for example, get an extra week off if the time
is taken between Oct. 1 and May 31.
	   Yet, long-established vacation habits are slow to change. Paris
shopkeepers who remain open complain they run out of some goods
because their suppliers and dealers are on vacation.
	   A shopper looking recently for an oversized envelope was told
the new shipment wouldn't arrive until ``la rentree'' _ Sept. 1,
which marks the return to work and school.
	   These days Paris in August is pleasantly paced but still sleepy
enough to lure film crews to the capital.
	   According to Le Parisien newspaper, more than 15 films are shot
on location somewhere in the capital every day in August.
	   ``It's the ideal time for us,'' said Antonin Depardieu, a set
manager for a German production. ``The Parisians are gone so we
don't disrupt things so much, even when we have to block off a
street.''
	   Yet, life is far busier than a decade ago when you couldn't get
a haircut or buy a newspaper in some neighborhoods.
	   The annual closure of bakeries and pharmacies are regulated so
Parisians aren't left stranded, and outdoor markets, with only a
few stalls shuttered, do a brisk business,
	   ``There was a time when I couldn't even find an open cafe or buy
a newspaper in my quarter during the month of August,'' said
Dominique Perrin, a retired publicist, who lives near the posh Parc
Monceau. ``Now I can.''
	   Working Parisians say commuting is painless as traffic jams thin
to a trickle.
	   ``Our work load is much lighter because our clients are on
vacation,'' said Nadege Legros, 48, an insurance broker, who breaks
up her seven weeks' paid leave and goes away several times during
the year.
	   She takes off two weeks in July and two in August in order to
have ``different kinds of vacation, time with children, and time
alone'' with her husband.
	   ``Paris is marvelous in August. There are no lines anywhere _
banks, movie theaters, museums, even the post office,'' Legros
said.

Opposition lawmaker prepares for prison

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with defense requesting less prison time, Lim eating
symbolic last meal, human rights groups attending hearing

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ An opposition lawmaker convicted
of sedition for criticizing the Malaysian judiciary appealed to
federal judges Monday for a reconsideration of his prison sentence.
	   If his appeal fails, Lim Guan Eng will be the first sitting
Malaysian Parliament member to be sent to prison.
	   Lim, 38, deputy secretary-general of the Democratic Action Party
and a Parliament member for 12 years, was convicted last year of
printing ``false news'' in a 1995 pamphlet entitled, ``The True
Story.'' He was sentenced to a year and a half in prison.
	   The case is being watched closely by human rights activists and
representatives of Amnesty International and the International
Community of Jurists attended the hearing.
	   In his pamphlet, Lim criticized the government's decision not to
press statutory rape charges against Abdul Rahim Tamby Chik, a
former chief minister of Lim's home state, Malacca.
	   The pamphlet questioned why the 15-year-old girl involved in the
scandal was detained, but not Abdul Rahim, a leading member of the
ruling United Malays National Organization.
	   A three-judge panel of the Federal Court of Appeal on Monday was
to decide whether to uphold Lim's sentence set by a lower appellate
court. In the morning, they denied Lim's request for the case to be
heard by a larger panel.
	   Hundreds of Lim supporters surrounded the federal courthouse
Monday dressed in white T-shirts printed with the word ``Freedom''
and caps that read ``Justice.'' They stood silently, some with DAP
decals taped across their mouths.
	   Lim said he was prepared to go to prison.
	   ``I'm very hopeful that justice will prevail,'' he told The
Associated Press during a break in the hearing. ``Even if it
doesn't, I'm prepared to go down for justice and women's rights.
That's a cause worth fighting for, worth going down for.''
	   During the courtroom lunch break, photographers crowded around
Lim as he ate a symbolic last meal of fried rice and vegetables
from a Styrofoam takeout box.
	   ``It's a show of solidarity and we fear it may his last meal
with us,'' said one defense attorney, Gobind Singh Deo.
	   Lim's original sentence called for a 15,000 ringgit (dlrs 3,570)
fine. It was dismissed and replaced with a jail term by the Court
of Appeal in April, when Lim lost his first appeal.
	   Judge Gopal Sri Ram, in announcing that court's decision, said:
``It is time that the court sends a clear message that it cannot
tolerate any attack on the judiciary.''
	   Lim's father, Lim Kit Siang, is head of the DAP and the
opposition leader of Parliament. In a statement Saturday, he called
on the Federal Court to reconsider his son's application for a
bench of nine judges to hear the appeal.
	   That application was denied last month. Attempts for an even
smaller bench of five judges were denied Monday.
	   Lim's lead defense attorney Karpal Singh asked the court to set
aside or reduce the prison term. Eighteen months, he said, ``is a
clear case of overkill.''
	   The elder Lim said the refusal of a hearing by a larger panel of
judges heightened ``grave concern'' that his son was ``a victim of
selective prosecution.''
	   ``On Aug. 24, it is not only Guan Eng who will be on trial, the
system of justice in Malaysia will also be on trial _ not only in
the eyes of Malaysians, but also in the eyes of the world.''

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The Cambodian opposition raised the
stakes Monday in protests against strongman Hun Sen, staging a
sit-in outside the National Assembly at the same site of a
murderous grenade attack against a demonstration in 1997.
	   The sit-in built on the momentum of a protest by 10,000 people
Sunday demanding that Hun Sen open investigations into allegations
of fraud in National Assembly elections a month ago won by his
Cambodian People's Party.
	   Close to 1,000 people turned up in front of the National
Assembly on Monday following a rally three times that size at the
city's main sports stadium, where opposition leader Sam Rainsy
denounced Hun Sen as a killer.
	   At the assembly, some protesters sat in the road, blocking
traffic, and others were packed into a park. Some perched in trees
or on their friends' shoulders. About 20 police armed with
Kalashnikov rifles kept watch.
	   Sam Rainsy jumped on the hood of a pickup truck to address the
crowd, saying the people would remain 24 hours a day on mats under
mosquito nets.
	   ``If they want this protest to stop they should deal with our
complaints,'' Sam Rainsy said. ``If they do not we have no
alternative but to express our discontent through demonstrations
and sit-ins.''
	   The park was the site of a grenade attack by a protest Sam
Rainsy was leading March 30, 1997, that killed 16 people and
wounded more than 100, including him. No one was ever arrested, but
the attack has widely been blamed on Hun Sen.
	   A grenade was thrown and shots were fired Thursday at the
headquarters of the National Election Committee as Sam Rainsy tried
to lead a sleep-in at the compound. One person was killed.
	   The government has accused unspecified terrorists, but the Sam
Rainsy Party and the other chief opposition group, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC, have said responsibility lies with Hun Sen.
	   Ranariddh, who was toppled as co-prime minister in a bloody coup
by Hun Sen last year, returned Monday from a private visit in
Bangkok, Thailand.
	   The prince, whose party finished second in the vote, and Sam
Rainsy, who placed a distant third, complain that Hun Sen resorted
to massive cheating to win the polls and changed the formula under
which parliamentary seats were allotted.
	   Under the official count, Hun Sen has 64 seats in the 122-member
assembly, a slight majority but short of the two-thirds needed to
form a new government by Sept. 24, when the new assembly is
scheduled to meet for the first time.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy are boycotting the assembly and the
prince has so far refused offers to join a coalition.
	   Earlier, in a rally at the stadium, Sam Rainsy called on the
Cambodian People's Party to remove Hun Sen, whom he called
``stupid, a traitor and a murderer.''
	   ``Down with Hun Sen the murderer!'' he told cheering supporters.
	   Organizers had officially canceled the rally, saying they wanted
to give the government one more week to address complaints. But
more than 3,000 still turned out.
	   Sam Rainsy arrived to tell them to disband, but apparently
caught up in the moment, he kept the rally going for two hours and
threatened to call a protest of 100,000 people.
	   Hundreds of Ranariddh's supporters were killed in the months
that followed last year's coup. Hun Sen organized new polls to win
back legitimacy and aid lost after his takeover. International
observers endorsed them as credible.
	   However, they looked mostly at voting day and the first day of
counting, which were relatively peaceful and well-run, and largely
downplayed pre-election violence against the opposition and delays
in counting the ballots, which took 10 days.

Kosovo rebel fighters reassemble across border in Albania
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TROPOJA, Albania (AP) _ Olive drab tents and campfires dot the
white pine forests that provide refuge for Kosovo guerrillas. Young
recruits learn combat skills, while veterans share stories of
fallen comrades.
	   Thousands of ethnic Albanian rebels from Kosovo have gathered
across the border in northern Albania, regrouping after the intense
Serb offensive that pushed them from their homeland last month.
	   The tough talk prevalent during their lightning victories
earlier this year when the rebels captured up to 40 percent of the
province is absent now. Instead, members of this makeshift army
wait _ quietly confident of ultimate victory in their independence
war, but reflecting caution about the difficult months ahead.
	   ``We are waiting for a high number of recruits,'' said a senior
commander who fled to Albania with his fighters last week after
Serb forces unleashed heavy firepower to push them out of most of
their strongholds.
	   ``We must make our offensive before the winter comes,'' said the
commander, who uses the nom de guerre Rrufeja, or Lightning.
	   The guerrillas say the border crossings will become more
difficult in a couple of months as rains, and then snow, obliterate
the mountain trails that currently support pack mules with weapons
and supplies.
	   The towering mountains separating Albania from the secessionist
Serbian province are only one of the huge obstacles facing the
outgunned, outmanned, loosely organized Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   A Serb counter-offensive that began in mid-July killed hundreds
and pushed the KLA out of strategic border towns. The routes once
used to smuggle weapons in from northern Albania are no longer
secure.
	   With much of the KLA force in northern Albania, they must now
launch sporadic attacks on Yugoslav army border patrols to prevent
the Serbs from completely sealing the border.
	   ``A lot of our people have been killed in this Serb offensive,''
said Rrufeja, who claimed to command about 1,500 rebels who fled
Kosovo in the last two weeks.
	   Among the dead were senior KLA officers, including 32-year-old
Abi Berisha, who participated in the daring capture of the
Belacevac coal mine in June before being killed Aug. 17 in Junik,
he said.
	   Continued backing by allies outside the country _ supplying
officers, recruits and weapons alike _ will be crucial.
	   Rrufeja pointed to dozens of fresh-faced recruits, mostly native
ethnic Albanians recently arrived from manual labor jobs in
Germany, Switzerland and other countries. He said he sent more than
600 through the mountain passes under cover of darkness over the
weekend and was waiting to send more.
	   Rrufeja said thousands of veterans and recruits are available.
	   He said his forces, who walk confidently in uniform on the
Albanian side of the border, include one native Finnish volunteer,
three from Holland, 17 Muslim fighters from Egypt, Syria and Libya,
20 from Bosnia, five Croatians, an Italian and 13 Turks. He said at
least 120 more Middle Eastern fighters, whom he called mujahadeen,
are currently fighting Serbs in Kosovo.
	   Despite international calls on Albania to prevent the use of its
territory by the rebels, Albanian police and army do little to stop
the guerrillas from seeking refuge or launching attacks.
	   Bill Foxton, the head of an international observer mission to
watch the border between Kosovo and Albania, said several KLA
veterans who live in western Europe have given up the fight in
recent weeks, frustrated at poor planning.
	   ``They're coming here, selling their guns at a loss, and going
back home,'' said Foxton, head of the mission of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe. ``They're frustrated
because they wait one, two, three weeks for any orders to result in
actual movement.''

Perkins worried about illness
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Dual Olympic swimming champion Kieren
Perkins expressed concern over his Commonwealth Games campaign
Monday following an energy-sapping illness.
	   Perkins, the Olympic 1500-meter gold medalist at the 1992 and
1996 Olympics, has been forced out of the pool by the flu.
	   Australia's team for the Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur will
go into camp in Perth Tuesday before traveling to Singapore and
then on to KL for the Sept. 11 start.
	   ``The biggest problem we've got at the moment is that if I get
back into it too hard, too fast, I could have a relapse,'' Perkins,
25, said Monday. ``We don't want that. We're going to try to do
everything we can to make sure that doesn't happen and really now
is just a matter of easing back into some work. I haven't done any
hard work since I've been sick.''
	   Australia is sending a 41-member team to KL and is expected to
again dominate the pool. Australia claimed 53 medals in Victoria,
Canada, in 1994, including 25 gold.
	   Perkins swam a fast 800-meter earlier this month after failing
to make Australia's team for the world titles in January. His
biggest rivals in KL will be fellow Australians Grant Hackett, the
world champion, and Olympic and world silver medalist Daniel
Kowalski.
	   ``Getting sick was disappointing,'' Perkins said. ``It's meant
that I've missed a week of improvement. Probably a little bit more
it'll end up being. But I'm not upset at this stage.''
	   The triple world record holder won the 1994 Commonwealth
1500-meter title in dramatic fashion, setting two world records in
the one race _ for 800- and 1500-meters. He still holds both marks.

Police break up pro-democracy demonstration in Myanmar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with police breaking up protest. Adjust number of
protesters to more than 200 throughout.

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar police broke up the first
demonstration against military rule in nearly two years Monday as
more than 200 student pro-democracy activists spilled into the
streets of Yangon.
	   Blocking traffic at Hledan Junction near Yangon University, the
protesters waved red flags with a yellow fighting peacock, the
symbol of the democracy movement and the political party of
opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   ``Down with the totalitarian government!'' the demonstrators
chanted. ``Our cause must succeed!''
	   Others sang the national anthem.
	   They quickly dispersed, running down side streets, as soon as
trucks carrying about 50 baton-wielding policeman arrived on the
scene almost an hour after the protest began.
	   Although they chased the students, it appeared most, if not all
of them, got away. Police then closed off the busy intersection to
traffic.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military
since 1962. The army brutally crushed protests during a nationwide
democracy uprising in 1988, gunning down as many as 3,000 people.
	   Monday's demonstration erupted as political tensions were rising
in Myanmar. Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner, was in the
13th day of a roadside standoff with the military outside Yangon
over its restrictions on her right to travel freely.
	   Her party, the National League for Democracy, also has said it
will convene the parliament elected in 1990, after the military
refused to meet the NLD's Aug. 21 deadline to do so.
	   The party won 82 percent of the seats in parliament but the
military refused to honor the result. It has warned the NLD that
any attempt to convene parliament is illegal and will jeopardize
possible talks with military leaders.
	   The protest Monday began shortly after noon when a young man ran
to the middle of the junction in downtown Yangon and began clapping
his hands. About 80 protesters then joined him.
	   After a short while, the crowd swelled to more than 200 as more
students marched into the intersection. They asked onlookers to
take part, and cheered when a Buddhist monk joined in.
	   The young protesters distributed pamphlets signed by the Yangon
Students Union that said:
	   ``The student union fully supports the NLD demand for a
parliament, and we urge the public to fight for the restoration of
a civilian government to replace the authoritarian regime.''
	   Student unions have been illegal in Myanmar since the military
seized power in 1962. Students have traditionally been at the
forefront of the Myanmar independence movements and the struggle
for democracy.
	   The authorities were apparently caught unaware of Monday's
protest. Angry motorists honked their horns in frustration.
	   The last street protests in Myanmar took place in December 1996,
and were organized by students demanding more civil rights and the
right to form a student union.
	   The military used water cannon to break up those demonstrations.
It later sentenced dozens of student leaders and members of the
youth wing of Suu Kyi's party to long prison terms.
	   Meanwhile, the military has prevented doctors from treating Suu
Kyi, who is reportedly suffering from kidney problems, low blood
pressure, dizziness and a urinary tract infection during her
standoff.
	   She and three colleagues are encamped in a van on a bridge 32
kilometers (20 miles) west of Yangon in their fourth attempt in two
months to travel to the city of Bassein to meet party members.

Chernomyrdin back atop Russian government, Kiriyenko out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with Yeltsin-Chernomyrdin meeting, parliament
not to meet until next week, Zyuganov demanding appointment be
withdrawn, Lebed quote, other details. Trims. CHANGES byline. WILL
BE UPDATED after Yeltsin's televised address, scheduled for noon
(0800 GMT). &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin returned
Monday to the office he was forced to abandon five months ago, when
President Boris Yeltsin entrusted the government to a technocrat
little more than half his age.
	   Chernomyrdin faces an unprecedented economic crisis, a feisty
parliament and a public skeptical that any change at the top can
improve its lot. His reappointment came one week after the Russian
government effectively devalued its national currency, the ruble,
and announced it would restructure the country's short-term debts.
	   Yeltsin dismissed the government of Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko on Sunday without explanation and named Chernomyrdin
acting premier. Yeltsin asked the parliament on Monday morning to
approve his candidate, but parliamentary leaders announced
immediately that they would not convene a plenary session for at
least a week and asked for more time to consider the appointment.
	   Yeltsin met with Chernomyrdin in his Kremlin office while
Kiriyenko held a farewell meeting with his colleagues in the
government headquarters known as the White House.
	   Chernomyrdin started consultations on the make-up of the new
government early Monday. He spoke with regional leaders, including
Gen. Alexander Lebed, the presidential hopeful who is governor of
the Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia. Chernomyrdin was expected to
consult with parliamentary leaders later in the day.
	   ``The first thing I will do as acting head of government is to
analyze the situation on Russia's financial and stock markets,''
Chernomyrdin was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The government's dismissal came a little more than a week before
Yeltsin is to host U.S. President Bill Clinton at a summit meeting
in Moscow. White House officials with Clinton in Edgartown,
Massachusetts, said the trip would go forward as planned and would
focus on Russia's efforts at economic reform.
	   ``Those policies are not specifically based on personality,''
said P.J. Crowley, spokesman for Clinton's National Security
Council.
	   Kiriyenko is a 36-year-old former banker who had won respect
from Western economists and some Russians even as he failed to stem
the collapse of the Russian stock market and the steady degradation
of the economy.
	   Although Chernomyrdin is generally respected in political and
business circles, the sudden change seemed likely to further
undermine confidence in Yeltsin's leadership.
	   ``This is totally consistent with his past strategy of blaming
his government for all the problems in the country,'' said William
Browder, head of Hermitage Capital Management in Moscow. ``It will
be interesting to see whether the Russian public doesn't hold him
responsible this time.''
	   ``It's simply comical,'' said Vladimir Lukin, a leader of the
liberal Yabloko bloc in parliament. The ITAR-Tass news agency
quoted him as saying the decision ``reveals the deep confusion and
uncertainty at the center of executive power.''
	   But Lebed, the Krasnoyarsk governor, said he supported the move.
	   ``Today the situation is such that the prime minister of Russia
must be someone from among the political heavyweights. Another
person, even the most talented and smart, can't cope with the
situation since he doesn't have time to gather political weight,''
Lebed said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Chernomyrdin, who headed the Gazprom national gas monopoly
during the Soviet era, was Yeltsin's prime minister and steady
right-hand man from December 1992 until this March, when the
president said Russia needed new, more energetic leadership.
	   Chernomyrdin's government failed to pass comprehensive tax laws,
or stamp out rampant tax evasion among Russian companies.
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said the Chernomyrdin
nomination notwithstanding, the Communist-led majority in the
parliament was still calling for Yeltsin himself to step down and
for wide-ranging discussions on the formation of a coalition
government.
	   Russians who heard the news on an otherwise quiet Sunday evening
expressed resignation at the president's mercurial leadership.
	   ``How can I possibly make sense of it?'' asked Sergei Tikhonov,
a sports magazine editor. ``It's impossible. In America, your
leaders give you reasons for things _ here we're told nothing. What
are we supposed to think?''
	   The ruble dropped 0.135 against the U.S. dollar on the interbank
currency exchange on Monday, to close at 7.14 rubles to the dollar.
	   The government was expected to announce the terms of
restructuring the country's short-term debts on Monday. It had
already postponed the announcement for five days under pressure
from foreign investors who fear Russia will offer them a worse deal
than Russian banks.

Australia almost split South Pacific Forum: chairman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   POHNPEI, Federated States of Micronesia (AP) _ Australia pushed
the South Pacific Forum to the brink of collapse with its hardline
stance on greenhouse gases at last year's annual meeting, the
outgoing chairman said Monday.
	   Opening the 1998 meeting, Cook Islands Prime Minister Sir
Geoffrey Henry said the forum's unity had been ``sorely tested''
for the first time in its 27-year history when Australia insisted
on watering down calls for binding international gas emission
targets.
	   ``It was only after a great deal of thought and a desire on the
part of some leaders not to split the forum _ perhaps irrevocably _
that a minimum forum position was ultimately arrived at,'' Henry
said. ``One that virtually all forum leaders would have wanted to
see strengthened.''
	   After a tense diplomatic standoff, Pacific island nations gave
in to Australia in 1997 and agreed not to endorse binding targets
for greenhouse gas emissions.
	   Australia, a major oil and coal producer and big aid donor in
the region, threatened to divide the forum by refusing to budge on
its global warming position despite concerns by low-lying Pacific
states about the threat of global warming.
	   The low-lying Pacific states, some of them only one or two
meters (3 to 6 feet) above sea level, fear they could be wiped out
by rising ocean levels caused by global warming.
	   Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer Monday played down
Henry's remarks.
	   ``He makes his own judgments,'' Downer told reporters. ``Last
year was a tough meeting; this year the atmosphere's a lot easier,
a lot more relaxed a lot more positive.''
	   The dominant issue of the meeting will be economic reform,
Downer said.
	   The forum is discussing an economic action plan aimed at helping
struggling island nations ease their dependency on aid and develop
sustainable economies.
	   Australia has opposed a proposed South Pacific Free Trade area,
advocating instead a lowering of trade protection tariffs in the
region.
	   Also Monday, Australia announced an aid program to help nations
in the South Pacific, which lie near the International dateline,
deal with the so-called Millennium bug.
	   There are 16 forum member states: Australia, Cook Islands, the
Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, New Zealand,
Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon
Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.

	   KANSAS CITY, Missouri (AP) _ Digital Takawira scored in the
first half Chris Snitko posted his first career shutout as the
Kansas City Wizards defeated the Miami Fusion 2-0 Sunday.
	   The win put the Wizards (11-14) in a tie for third place with
the Colorado Rapids in the Western Conference.
	   Takawira scored the game winning goal in the 36th minute. He got
an assist from defender Scott Vermillion, who also scored his
first-ever MLS goal with only five minutes left in the game.
	   Preki also had two assists, giving him 10 for the season and
moving him into the league's top 15 point producers.
	   Wizards coach Ron Newman removed starting defender Matt McKeon
and goalkeeper Mike Ammann, two of Kansas City's top producers,
from starting lineup, giving Snitko a chance to play.
	   The strategy paid off, as Snitko earned his first career shutout
in just his second game of the season and the sixth of his MLS
career. He also earned an assist on Vermillion's 85th-minute goal.
	   Kansas City and Colorado are tied in the division at 29 points,
with Dallas at 28 points. Kansas City holds a tiebreaker advantage
over both teams in the race for the final two playoff spots.
	   Miami (12-13) remained five points ahead of Tampa Bay for the
final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.

and goalkeeper Mike Ammann, two of Kansas City's top producers,
from starting lineup, giving Snitko a chance to play.
	   The strategy paid off, as Snitko earned his first career shutout
in just his second game of the season and the sixth of his MLS
career. He also earned an assist on Vermillion's 85th-minute goal.
	   Kansas City and Colorado are tied in the division at 29 points,
with Dallas at 28 points. Kansas City holds a tiebreaker advantage
over both teams in the race for the final two playoff spots.
	   Miami (12-13) remained five points ahead of Tampa Bay for the
final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.

Indonesian military fires son-in-law of Suharto in kidnappings case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A senior general who is the son-in-law
of former President Suharto was fired on Monday amid suspicion he
ordered the kidnappings of political activists.
	   Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto is a former chief of Indonesia's
special forces, which have been implicated in abductions and
torture of Suharto's opponents since last year.
	   ``He will not be active anymore within the armed forces,'' armed
forces chief Gen. Wiranto said at a news conference after assessing
a report by military investigators.
	   Wiranto did not rule out a trial of Prabowo if more evidence of
wrongdoing emerges in the case against 10 lower-ranking soldiers
arrested in connection with the kidnappings. They will be tried in
a military court.
	   In recent weeks, Prabowo had testified behind closed doors
before a military tribunal of seven generals, known as an ``honor
council.''
	   He had been suspended from duty pending the investigation.
	   Prabowo has said he was ready to take responsibility for the
kidnappings if it were proven his troops were responsible.
	   Human rights activists have accused top military brass of
ordering the abductions.
	   Under new, reform-minded President B.J. Habibie, the military
has pledged to pursue those implicated in human rights abuses.
	   More than two dozen activists were allegedly kidnapped. At least
14 are still missing and are feared dead.
	   Those that have been released said they were abducted, tortured
and questioned about their political activities.
	   The ambitious and brash Prabowo is a controversial figure whose
fast-rising career was sidelined after the sudden downfall of his
autocratic father-in-law.
	   Soon after Suharto resigned amid riots and student protests in
May, Wiranto transferred Prabowo, who was considered a rival, from
his powerful command to head a military college.
	   A separate government team investigating May's riots is also
expected to question Prabowo on allegations of military involvement
in the violence, in which 1,200 people were killed and thousands of
building were looted, damaged or burned.

Deputy prime minister: Speculators plot to overthrow us
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Malaysian government resumed
its attack on foreign currency speculators Monday, saying Southeast
Asian economies had allowed the currency traders to ``plot and
scheme behind our backs.''
	   Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who is also finance
minister, called on Southeast Asian economies to band together to
protect their interests, the national news agency Bernama reported.
	   Anwar said the regional economies had been too trusting.
	   ``When (foreign speculators) talk of friendship and cooperation,
we believe them without reservations,'' he told the ASEAN
Inter-Parliamentary Organization conference, which opened in the
Malaysian capital on Monday.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has repeatedly blamed Western
currency speculators for triggering the Asian financial crisis and
has called for clampdowns on global currency trading.
	   Anwar said that because Southeast Asian economies had no hidden
agenda, they also did not suspect ``anyone else had any of their
own and we allowed them to plot and scheme behind our backs.''
	   Anwar said Southeast Asian economies had been hurt because
certain excesses in a free-market system had been overlooked amid
the desire to ensure rapid development of societies.
	   More than 300 delegates and observers were attending the
five-day conference of the Association for Southeast Asian Nations
inter-parliament.
	   The delegates included representatives from Singapore, the
Philippines, Vietnam, Laos and Malaysia. Observers have come from
Australia, Cambodia, China, the European Union Parliament, Japan,
Korea, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Canada.

Indonesians protest outside U.S. Embassy in anti-bombing rally
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads with legislators criticizing United States, other
detail.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 50 demonstrators in the world's
most populous Muslim country rallied outside the U.S. Embassy on
Monday to protest the U.S. missile strikes in Sudan and
Afghanistan.
	   The protesters said the United Nations should censure U.S.
President Bill Clinton for what they called criminal acts.
	   Clinton ordered the attacks on alleged terrorist sites last week
in retaliation for the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania in which some 270 people were killed.
	   ``We condemn the terrorist action against the two U.S.
Embassies, but we also abhor what America has done in Sudan and
Afghanistan,'' read a statement issued by the protesters. They
identified themselves as members of the Indonesian Anti-Terrorist
Committee.
	   Dozens of police stood guard outside the embassy gates, but the
protest was peaceful.
	   One protester, a young girl wearing a Muslim shawl, hoisted a
sign that read, ``Don't be sad, Afghanistan.''
	   Some Muslim groups around the world view the U.S. strikes as an
attack on their faith. Reaction has been muted in Indonesia, where
90 percent of the 202 million people are Muslim.
	   President B.J. Habibie has said the U.S. retaliation was not an
assault on Islam.
	   Some Indonesian legislators have also criticized the U.S.
action, the official Antara news agency said.
	   ``(The United States) took the law into its own hands to take
revenge,'' Antara quoted lawmaker Aisyah Amini as saying.
	   Another legislator said the strikes may have been a ploy by
Clinton to distract attention from the scandal surrounding his
affair with Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern.

Governments told to clear up funding for security's sake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sydney Olympic security planning,
including the protection of VIPs, may be impeded by tension between
Australian governments over funding, an official report warned
Monday.
	   The Auditor-General's report into the Commonwealth's security
arrangements for the Olympics said lengthy and often bitter talks
on cost-sharing for the games may be hampering security planning
between the federal and New South Wales state governments.
	   The report, tabled out of session in parliament Monday, said
overall security planning had so far been effective, ``but there is
scope for improvement in respect of specific issues.''
	   ``The absence of a memorandum of understanding between the
commonwealth and NSW governments is seen as an important threshold
issue,'' the report said. ``Similarly, the lack of agreement on
cost-sharing arrangements may be impeding the ability of agencies
to plan effectively.''
	   The governments were urged to try harder.
	   ``More work should be done to integrate the criminal and
national security intelligence functions and to maximize the
opportunities for analytical interaction and coordination at the
Commonwealth level,'' the report said.
	   Pointing to Sydney Airport as a key security concern, the report
said greater liaison was needed on counter-terrorism responses at
the airport. Closer ties were also required for border control and
the protection of visiting dignitaries.
	   The federal government, in its May budget, made a provisional
allocation of up to Australian dlrs 32 million (U.S. dlrs 18.5
million) to the Olympics organizers but tied it to the outcome of
talks with the NSW government.
	   A spokesman for Sports Minister Andrew Thomson said funding
negotiations had recently been resumed after a seven week silence
from the NSW government.
	   A spokesman for NSW Olympics Minister Michael Knight refused to
comment on the funding issue, but said the minister welcomed the
report.
	   ``There are some very good relationships in place between
federal security services and the NSW police,'' the spokesman said.
	   ``(Knight's) very confident that these connections will make
Sydney as safe as it needs to be without our turning it into an
armed camp.''

Yeltsin congratulates Ukraine on Independence Day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin on Monday congratulated
Ukraine on its Independence Day and called for closer ties between
the two largest former Soviet republics.
	   ``Development of relations with Ukraine _ a friendly country and
a strategic partner _ is a main priority of Russia's foreign
policy,'' Yeltsin said in a letter to Ukrainian President Leonid
Kuchma.
	   Yeltsin expressed hope that his summit with Kuchma, scheduled
for Sept. 18-19 in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, will ``give a
powerful impulse'' to Russian-Ukrainian relations.
	   In February, the two leaders signed an ambitious economic
cooperation plan, and Yeltsin said that there were ``no unsettled
problems'' left between their nations.
	   However, there has been discord over Russian customs taxes on
Ukrainian goods. Fictions likewise remain over control of the Black
Sea naval bases from the Soviet era and Ukraine's natural gas debts
to Russia.
	   Also, the Russian parliament has failed to ratify a friendship
treaty that was signed last year.
	   Ukraine declared its independence on Aug. 24, 1991, several days
after the failed hard-line coup against Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev. Along with similar moves by other ex-Soviet republics,
it paved the way for the collapse of the Soviet Union in December
of that year.

Report: Israel increases security at airports following threats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOD, Israel (AP) _ Israel is tightening security at its airports
in response to threats by Islamic militants to attack Israeli and
U.S. targets, including airlines, Israel radio said Monday.
	   Israel Airport Authority officials were in a meeting Monday
morning and not immediately available for comment.
	   Threats against U.S. and Israeli targets emerged after last
week's U.S. air strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan that were aimed at
Osama bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire and Islamic militant linked to
the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa this month.
	   On Sunday, a leading Muslim activist close to bin Laden said
Islamic militants are preparing to retaliate for the air strikes by
targeting U.S. and Israeli strategic sites and airliners.
	   Israel radio said security was being tightened at Ben Gurion
International Airport near Tel Aviv and at airfields in Eilat and
Tel Aviv. At Ben Gurion, cars entering the airport were being
checked more closely and some delays were being reported in getting
into the airport, the radio said.
	   In a related development, the Haaretz daily said that metal
detectors at Ben Gurion do not pick up certain items that contain
metal, including kitchen knives and big key chains.
	   Haaretz tested the five metal detectors in the departure hall
twice and found that the equipment did not pick up on metal items
weighing about 350 grams, or a little over half a pound.
	   Security measures at Ben Gurion are among the most stringent
worldwide. Motorists are stopped at checkpoints at the airport
entrances, with some passengers _ generally Palestinians _ being
questioned there and having their luggage checked.
	   In the departure lounge, tourists, Palestinians and Israeli Arab
citizens are questioned at length, while Jewish Israelis usually
undergo only a perfunctory check.

Capital's airport wants direct flights to Angkor sites stopped
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The manager of the international
airport in Cambodia's capital has urged the government to halt
direct foreign flights to Siem Reap, home to the ancient Angkorian
temples, a newspaper said Monday.
	   Flights to Siem Reap from Thailand by the small Thai carrier
Bangkok Airways have bitten into the revenues of the capital's
Pochentong airport, managed by a French-Malaysian joint venture.
	   The direct flights from Bangkok opened last year in an attempt
to revitalize the tourism industry, which plummeted after a coup in
the capital by strongman Hun Sen against his co-prime minister.
	   Eric Chalon, the general manager of Cambodia Airport Management
Services, which runs Pochentong, was quoted by the Cambodian Daily
as saying that the direct flights to Siem Reap violate the
government's contract with his company.
	   The contract stipulated that Pochentong would be the sole
international air gateway in the small Southeast Asian nation for
20 years.
	   ``Pochentong is a very visible symbol of international
investment, and if we want the confidence of international
investors, there need to be clear rules,'' Chalon was quoted as
saying.
	   The company is the commercial management arm of a venture
between France's Dumez GTM and Malaysia's Muhibbah Masteron Bhd,
which signed a multi-million dollar deal with the Cambodian
government in 1995 to upgrade Pochentong airport.
	   But when tourism to Cambodia came to a screeching halt following
the coup last year _ accompanied by massive looting of the airport
by Hun Sen's victorious soldiers _ the government decided to open
direct flights between Siem Reap and Bangkok.
	   One year later, flights are still bypassing Phnom Penh. Chalon
said the contract violation sends a poor signal to foreign
investors, whose capital the country badly needs.
	   The paper quoted Tourism Secretary of State Thong Khon as saying
that the government has not yet decided if the Bangkok Airways
chartered flights between Thailand and Siem Reap should be stopped.
	   So far, Thon Khon was quoted as saying, the move has proved a
good one, bringing a large number of tourists to Cambodia.

World's biggest weaving machinery maker announces net profit drop
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WINTERTHUR, Switzerland (AP) _ The world's biggest manufacturer
of weaving machinery, Sulzer Technology Corporation, on Monday
announced a 26 percent drop in first half net profit to 53 million
Swiss francs (dlrs 35 million).
	   Over the same period, net profit at subsidiary Sulzer Medica
dropped slightly to 32 million Swiss francs (dlrs 21 million) from
33 million Swiss francs (dlrs 22 million).
	   Sulzer Medica is a orthopedics group which produces pacemakers
and cardiovascular prostheses.
	   Exceptional charges of 55 million Swiss francs (dlrs 36.6
million) pressured both operating and net income, Sulzer said.
	   They resulted from foreseeable integration costs of the
acquisition of Italy's Nuovo Pignone's weaving machinery activities
and divestiture of the company's SLM locomotive business.
	   Despite the slump in first half profit, the group's chief
executive officer remains cautiously optimistic about Sulzer
prospects for the full year.
	   ``The net effects of acquisitions and divestitures on net income
can't yet be forecast. However, rapid implementation of these
strategic steps creates a good basis for sustainable profit
growth,'' Fritz Fahrni said in a press release, referring to
various internal efficiency-boosting measures.
	   So far, the Asian crisis has only affected Sulzer indirectly,
the company said.
	   While newly developed business activities in China and India
showed ``encouraging'' sales growth, orders received from South
East Asia declined to 2.8 percent from 4 percent of the total order
intake.

Indonesian military fires son-in-law of Suharto in kidnappings case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with military stripping authority from two other
officers under investigation. ADDS byline.
 &UR; By IRWAN FIRDAUS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A senior general who is the son-in-law
of former President Suharto was fired on Monday amid suspicion he
ordered the kidnappings of political activists.
	   Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto is a former chief of Indonesia's
special forces, which have been implicated in abductions and
torture of Suharto's opponents since last year.
	   ``He will not be active anymore within the armed forces,'' armed
forces chief Gen. Wiranto said at a news conference after assessing
a report by military investigators.
	   Wiranto did not rule out a court-martial of Prabowo if evidence
of his involvement emerges in the case against 10 lower-ranking
soldiers arrested in connection with the kidnappings. They will be
tried in a military court.
	   Two other senior officers who were under investigation, Maj.
Gen. Muchdi Purwopranjono and Col. Chairawan, were stripped of
their authority but allowed to stay in the army.
	   Muchdi was also a former chief of the special forces, known as
Kopassus, while Chairawan was in charge of the unit's intelligence
unit.
	   Without elaborating, Wiranto said the three officers had made a
mistake but praised their ``service to the nation.''
	   In recent weeks, Prabowo had testified behind closed doors
before a military tribunal of seven generals, known as an ``honor
council.''
	   He had been suspended from duty pending the investigation.
	   Prabowo has said he was ready to take responsibility for the
kidnappings if it were proven his troops were responsible.
	   Human rights activists have accused top military brass of
ordering the abductions.
	   Under new, reform-minded President B.J. Habibie, the military
has pledged to pursue those implicated in human rights abuses.
	   More than two dozen activists were allegedly kidnapped. At least
14 are still missing and are feared dead.
	   Those that have been released said they were abducted, tortured
and questioned about their political activities.
	   The ambitious and brash Prabowo is a controversial figure whose
fast-rising career was sidelined after the sudden downfall of his
autocratic father-in-law.
	   Soon after Suharto resigned amid riots and student protests in
May, Wiranto transferred Prabowo, who was considered a rival, from
his powerful command to head a military college.
	   A separate government team investigating May's riots is also
expected to question Prabowo on allegations of military involvement
in the violence, in which 1,200 people were killed and thousands of
building were looted, damaged or burned.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Students protesting against military
rule in Myanmar defied Thai government requests and police warnings
that they move further away from the Myanmar embassy in Bangkok on
Monday.
	   More than a hundred students, mostly exiles from Myanmar, have
been demonstrating outside the walls of the embassy for more than
two weeks. About 30 of them have been on a hunger strike since
Saturday.
	   Myanmar, which has been ruled by the military since 1962, is
also known as Burma.
	   The All Burma Students Democratic Front, one of the student
groups organizing the demonstration, said that 12 students had been
arrested Sunday and Monday morning by the Thai police.
	   The Thai police have denied arresting anybody.
	   The Thai government issued a statement over the weekend asking
the students to move their protest across the street from the
embassy.
	   ``The Burmese students should move their protest from in front
of the embassy to another side so that the protest does not block
the diplomats' work,'' Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said on
Sunday.
	   The students sent a letter to Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
saying, however, they weren't blocking the embassy's entrance,
which is on a side street.
	   Chuan said that Thailand, being a democratic country, provides
the students with the right to protest and freedom of expression,
but urged them to obey Thai laws.
	   The students are demanding that the military allow the
parliament elected in 1990 to convene, echoing a demand by the
National League for Democracy, the party of opposition leader and
Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   The NLD won 392 of the 485 seats in parliament, but the military
refused to honor the election results.
	   The NLD has said it will convene parliament itself, but the
military has warned that the move would be illegal.

Dollar soars on Russian turmoil, Tokyo stock prices drop

currency; ADDS trader comment in graf 8

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks tumbled Monday amid concern about
delays in government efforts to clean up the nation's bad
debt-ridden banking system. The dollar jumped against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped below the
psychologically-significant 15,000-point level for the first time
in a week, falling 309.84 points, or 2.03 percent, to close at
14,988.36. On Friday, the average fell 93.21 points, or 0.61
percent.
	   On currency markets, the dollar bought 144.40 yen as of late
afternoon, up 1.46 yen from late Friday in Tokyo but below its New
York rate of 144.91 yen late Friday.
	   Political uncertainty surrounds the government's plans to clean
up the banking system. While Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi has
promised a series of bills aimed at using public funds to speed up
write-offs of defaulted loans, opposition parties have vowed to
fight what they call a waste of taxpayers' money.
	   Criticism has focused on the prime minister's promise of more
than 500 billion yen (dlrs 3.4 billion) in public aid to help
ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. merge with Sumitomo
Trust and Banking Co.
	   ``Investors are cautious about whether parliament will smoothly
pass bills designed to restructure the financial system, including
bills that would allow the use of public funds to support LTCB,''
said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of the stock division at Chuo
Securities Co.
	   LTCB, once one of Japan's most prestigious lenders, announced
extensive restructuring steps late Friday. Traders say the plan
raised even more more questions about the bank's health, such as
whether it has enough assets to cover its enormous liabilities.
	   ``Investors want to see how LTCB's restructuring progresses,''
said Yoshihiro Ito, general manager of the equity department at
Okasan Securities Co.
	   An estimated 295 million shares changed hands on the first
section, down from Friday's 358 million. Declining shares
outnumbered advancers 9-to-2.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange dropped 18.21 points, or 1.55
percent, to 1,158.30. The TOPIX closed down 5.16 points, or 0.44
percent, on Friday.
	   Meanwhile, the dollar soared against the yen after political
turmoil in Russia prompted world investors to seek a safe haven in
the U.S. currency.
	   In a surprise announcement, Russian President Boris Yeltsin
dismissed his prime minister Sunday amid intense criticism for
failing to pull Russia out of one of its worst economic crises
since the Soviet collapse.
	   Concerns about Russia helped drive the dollar as high as 145.25
yen in the morning, but the greenback slipped to as low as 144.30
yen as Japanese officials said they may intervene to prop up their
nation's currency.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.135 percent from Friday's finish of 1.180 percent,
driving its price up to 112.19 yen from 111.87 yen.

Shevardnadze hopes Russia will remain stable after government

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze
said Monday that he hoped Russia would remain stable following
President Boris Yeltsin's ouster of the Russian Cabinet.
	   ``Stability in (Russia) is of paramount importance, especially
for Georgia,'' Shevardnadze said in his weekly radio address.
	   Yeltsin abruptly dismissed his government on Sunday in the midst
of a serious financial crisis, replacing his young prime minister,
Sergei Kiriyenko, with Viktor Chernomyrdin, who was booted from the
post only five months ago.
	   ``The most important thing for Georgia and the whole world is
that Russia should preserve and strengthen its stability,''
Shevardnadze said. ``My wish is that the decision of the Russian
president will meet this goal.''
	   Georgia, a former Soviet republic on the Black Sea, is dependent
on Russian troops to help maintain peace in the breakaway province
of Abkhazia. The peacekeepers were deployed in 1994 following a war
in which Abkhazian separatists drove out Georgian government troops
and civilians.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo's Angolan allies have driven rebel
forces from a string of Atlantic coast towns in a stunning reversal
of rebel gains, a senior government adviser said Monday.
	   Buoyed by recent successes, the government rejected a weekend
cease-fire proposal, insisting all Rwanda and Ugandan troops must
first withdraw from Congolese territory.
	   ``What we have said all along is that this rebellion is an
invasion by Rwanda and Uganda,'' said Ferdinand Mwana Naga, the
agriculture minister and one of President Laurent Kabila's closest
confidants. ``We cannot stop fighting until those foreign
aggressors are gone.''
	   South Africa and other member state of the South African
Development Community called for the cease-fire during a hastily
called weekend peace summit in Pretoria.
	   ``What we are concentrating upon is that there should be
cease-fire, there should be a standstill, followed by a process of
political negotiation,'' South African President Nelson Mandela
said.
	   In Kinshasa, a second ministry-level official said Angolan
forces fighting on Kabila's behalf had taken control of the oil
port town of Muanda and the nearby town of Banana.
	   Angolan reinforcements were moving toward Matadi, a vital Congo
river port town about 280 kilometers (175 miles) southwest of the
capital, Kinshasa, the official said on condition of anonymity.
	   The claims could not be independently confirmed, but a rebel
leader over the weekend acknowledged the loss of Kitona and its
airstrip, just a few kilometers (miles) east of Muanda.
	   Kitona, one of the first western towns to fall to the
insurgents, was used by the rebels to shuttle in reinforcements
airlifted across the country from their main bases in eastern
Congo.
	   The rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsi fighters and
disenchanted members of Kabila's army _ had make remarkable
progress toward Kinshasa in their three-week-old drive to topple
the government. Many of those same rebels helped put Kabila into
power after ousting longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last
year.
	   The insurgents, who accuse Kabila of power-grabbing, tribalism
and mismanagement, have pushed to within 30 kilometers (18 miles)
of Kinshasa and still control the town of Mbanza-Ngungu, the last
major obstacle before the capital.
	   Still, rebels forces in the west now appear to be caught between
two foreign forces at either end of a narrow corridor of Congolese
territory that links Kinshasa to the Atlantic coast.
	   The Angolans to the southwest and Zimbabwean soldiers deployed
last week who are defending Kinshasa's southern outskirts.
	   The rebels, however, countered by saying they had taken the
eastern city of Kisangani and were aiming at Kinshasa.
	   ``The Ituri district commissioner, Mr. Richard Dejju Mugenyi, in
collaboration with the operational office of the regional
chief-of-staff, announces to the public that since yesterday,
Kisangani has been under the control of the rebel Congolese Rally
for Democracy Front,'' rebel-controlled Radio Candip said.
	   Those claims also could not be independently confirmed.
	   Rwanda and Uganda _ in support of the rebels _ have repeatedly
warned Zimbabwe and Angola not to get involved, threatening direct
retaliatory intervention if they don't withdraw.
	   Zimbabwe, having extended more than dlrs 200 million in military
credits to Congo, has a financial stake in Kabila's government.
Angola's involvement may be partially driven by a concern that
Congo's rebels could link up with Angola's UNITA insurgent
movement.

Hong Kong government stock market intervention continues amid
</HEADLINE>
criticism
 &UR; By TARA SUILEN DUFFY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The government, eager to ward off speculators,
intervened in the stock markets for the sixth consecutive session
Monday in a move that has sparked heated debate in the territory.
	   Traders said aggressive government buying of Hong Kong blue
chips and futures contracts sent the market soaring Monday,
offsetting bearish factors ranging from the weaker Japanese yen and
Russian economic and political turmoil to grim domestic economic
data expected this week.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index gained 317.87 points, or 4.2
percent to finish the volatile day at 7,845.48. Most other stock
markets in the region plunged more than 2 percent in early trading
on a host of negative international and domestic market-moving
news.
	   Although some support the intervention, it has met with
widespread criticism from bankers, economists and politicians, who
say the move contradicts the government's long-standing
non-intervention policy and damages both the market's credibility
and public confidence.
	   Government officials say it is necessary to drive up the market
_ which plummeted to a five-year low earlier this month _ to ward
off speculators who have been betting the market would continue to
fall and driving up interest rates.
	   Joseph Yam, the chief executive of Hong Kong Monetary Authority,
the territory's quasi-central bank, wrote in a commentary Monday in
the South China Morning Post that buying shares does not contradict
the government's hands-off policy.
	   ``There's simply no better alternative for Hong Kong'' to deter
currency manipulation, he said. Hong Kong's dollar is pegged to the
U.S. dollar.
	   By buying shares, the government is targeting those who were
short selling the stock and futures markets and the currency.
Investors who sell the market short borrow shares, sell them hoping
the prices will fall, and then buy them back at the lower price,
pocketing the difference.
	   But political commentator C.K. Lau, writing in Sunday Morning
Post, said the intervention is against Hong Kong's free market
principle, a pillar of the territory's success.
	   ``A market cannot be considered free when a dominant player is
the government,'' he said.
	   The intervention also has created a false market, and long term
institutional investors are not sure of the real value of the
market since the government has started buying shares, said Mark
Simpson, head of Hong Kong and China Research for Nomura
International (HK) Ltd.
	   Analysts also warn that as soon as the government steps back
from the market, the index will fall sharply, further damaging
investor's confidence.
	   After the market closed 8.5 percent higher on Aug. 14, the
government announced it had intervened in the stock market that
day, and officials have said they will continue to be do so to
stabilize the market.
	   The main index had lost 60 percent of its value since its peak
last August before the intervention.
	   Officials have declined to say how much of the territory's huge
reserves have been spent in the market or how long they will
continue to intervene. Analysts estimate it has spent between 6-8
billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 772 million to U.S. dlrs 1.03
billion) since Aug. 14.
	   The intervention is the many measures the government has taken
to combat the territory's ailing economy.
	   These measures include credit guarantees to small businesses, to
ease the burdens stemming from high interest rates and a 15-year
high unemployment rate. The program was launched Monday
	   Meanwhile, Malaysia avidly supported the intervention and
followed the Hong Kong government's example by buying shares in its
own stock market last week.

Indonesian rights groups sue government, alleging inaction during
</HEADLINE>
riots

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Human rights groups sued the
government on Monday, alleging it failed to protect ethnic Chinese
during rioting that helped oust former President Suharto.
	   The lawsuit, filed in Central Jakarta district court, named
President B.J. Habibie, military chief Gen. Wiranto and other
security officials as defendants.
	   About 1,200 people died in the unrest in Jakarta in May, and
thousands of shops and homes were looted or burned. There were
widespread reports of mass rapes of ethnic Chinese girls and women.
	   Chinese, resented for their relative affluence, are often
targeted in times of social upheaval in Indonesia. They constitute
4 percent of the population of 202 million, but control large
sectors of the now paralyzed economy.
	   The Anti-Discrimination and Anti-Violence Committee, an umbrella
group of five human rights organizations, said the government
should pay hundreds of millions of dollars to people who lost
property or suffered psychological distress.
	   ``State officials did not give any protection to the people,
including Indonesian Chinese,'' said Jhonson Panjaitan, a committee
lawyer.
	   The human rights groups, which are unlikely to win their bid to
make the government pay reparations, indicated they would settle
for an apology from the authorities.
	   During the rioting, security forces responded slowly in many
areas of the city and looters were able to plunder at will.
	   A panel including human rights workers and government officials
is investigating whether elements in the military were involved in
the riots.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The mystery surrounding the
pharmaceutical plant attacked by the United States remains, perhaps
hidden with the melted packets of pain relievers and bottles of
antibiotics strewn among the rubble of red brick, splintered wood
and white plaster.
	   The United States says the plant was making precursors for
chemical weapons. Sudan says no such work occurred.
	   But interviews with Sudanese officials, doctors, lawyers and
plant employees suggest some of Sudan's claims are true: The plant
produced antibiotics and drugs for diseases like malaria and
tuberculosis, it planned to export to Iraq under U.N. approval, it
was privately owned and it was not a secret installation.
	   The plant, El Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co., was in an
industrial area near a relatively upscale neighborhood of Khartoum.
	   Four main buildings were on the site: three one-story factories
and a four-story administration building that is now half-standing.
The factories were destroyed, and fires still smoldered on Sunday,
emitting a stench of burning plastic.
	   The plant began production in December 1996. It offered a line
of 87 products, 12 of them for veterinary use, said Adam Umbadi, a
production engineer at the factory who helped install the
machinery.
	   El Shifa was the biggest of six pharmaceutical plants in the
Sudanese capital, employing 306 people, according to Umbadi and
Khartoum pharmacists.
	   Its main products were the antibiotic amoxicillin, which can be
used to treat malaria, and the pain reliever paracetamol, Umbadi
said.
	   All those products, packaged in El Shifa's blue and white
cartons, are available at Khartoum pharmacies. So are other El
Shifa antibiotics and drugs to treat ulcers and tuberculosis.
	   ``The spectrum of drugs they produce is very wide. No other
factory can produce all of it. There will be a loss,'' said Mona
Hamid, a doctor at Khartoum's Radiation and Isotope Center.
	   Among its products was Shifazole, an antibiotic to treat
parasites in animals. In January, the factory won a dlrs 199,000
contract to ship 100,000 cartons to Iraq under a U.N. exemption to
sanctions imposed in 1990, U.N. documents show. White cartons of
the antibiotic were scattered in the rubble.
	   The shipment was to be sent to Iraq by October, said Alamaddin
Al Shibli, the factory's export manager. The company began
exporting medicine this year to nearby Yemen and was scheduled to
send a shipment of veterinary medicine to Chad by month's end, he
said.
	   On Sunday, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger was asked on
CNN why no evidence of anything but commercial pharmaceuticals is
evident in the wreckage of the plant.
	   To protect intelligence methods and sources, Berger refused to
describe ``physical evidence'' the government has of a dual role
but said, ``I have no question, the intelligence community has no
question, that that factory was used to manufacture a chemical used
in making nerve gas.''
	   The plant was owned by Salah Idris, a Sudanese businessmen who
has homes in London, Saudi Arabia and Khartoum, according to his
lawyer, Ghazi Suleiman. He denies Idris ever met Osama bin Laden,
the exiled Saudi millionaire the United States says is connected to
the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   U.S. officials contend the Khartoum factory belonged to a
corporation in which bin Laden had a stake.
	   Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, a suspect in the embassy bombings,
reportedly told investigators he worked for bin Laden. Odeh was
arrested in Pakistan the day of the bombings and was returned to
Nairobi a week later.
	   ``He is my leader, and I obey his orders,'' Odeh was quoted as
saying in this week's edition of Newsweek magazine.
	   Idris was, 16th graf pvs

Cash-strapped zoo offers naming rights on animals

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ For 170,000 Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 21,795) a
year, you can be the proud sponsor of a panda _ named after
yourself.
	   Cash-strapped Guangzhou Zoo in southern China is offering animal

	   Sponsors also would be allowed ``private'' time to play with or
photograph their animals, and would have exclusive rights to use
them in advertisements, the report said.
	   But the sponsor cannot claim a refund if the animal dies, and
does not have a say in how the animal should be cared for, the Post
quoted zoo manager Liang Runtian as saying.
	   Annual sponsorship for an elephant is 100,000 Hong Kong dollars
(dlrs 12,821) and a tiger 80,000 Hong Kong dollar (dlrs 10,256),
according to initial estimates, the paper said.
	   The zoo has about 6,000 animals and attracts about three million
visitors a year, the Post said.

Nairobi boy flies to Britain for treatment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A Kenyan boy whose eyes were severely injured by
flying glass in the Aug. 7 bombing of the U.S. embassy in Nairobi
arrived Monday for treatment.
	   Stanley Matuma, 14, will be examined by doctors at Moorfields
Eye Hospital in central London, said Christine Miles, director of
operations at the hospital.
	   ``We believe the youngster's eyes were both blinded during the
explosion,'' said Ms. Miles. ``He suffered severe lacerations from
flying glass and there is severe hemorrhaging.''
	   The embassy bombing killed 247 people and injured more than
5,000. Ten people died in a nearly simultaneous blast at the U.S.
Embassy in Dar es Salaam, in neighboring Tanzania.
	   Ms. Miles said the Kenyan boy will be examined by consultant
Zdenek Gregor, who has close links with the Nairobi hospital where
he was being treated.

Communist rebels kill two soldiers in northern Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Communist rebels killed two army
soldiers and wounded another during a gunfight in the northern
Philippines, police said Monday.
	   Police said soldiers from the army's 54th infantry battalion
were on patrol Saturday in Bontoc town in Mountain Province when
they were fired upon by communist New People's Army guerrillas.
	   The two killed were 2nd Lt. Pericles Tirasol and an enlisted
man, police said.
	   Police said the army troopers claimed some of the rebels were
also hit but were carried off by their comrades.
	   Occasional clashes between the government and communist rebels
have been reported but have become less frequent in recent weeks.
The two sides will resume peace talks early next month.
	   Communist negotiators said the recent approval of a human rights
accord by President Joseph Estrada was a major boost to the talks.
	   The rebels had refused to resume negotiations without
presidential approval of the agreement on human rights and
international humanitarian law signed by negotiators in March.
Estrada approved the accord last early this month.
	   The communists said they will announce a unilateral cease-fire
between September and December following the approval of the
accord.
	   The accord also supports the indemnification of 9,539 Filipinos
who won a class action suit for human rights abuses under the late
dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
	   The peace negotiations began in September 1992 and have been
stalled several times, partly because of the arrest of several
rebel leaders said to have been involved in the talks.
	   When they resume, the two sides will attempt to craft an
agreement on economic and social reforms, the second of four
accords leading to a political settlement of the 29-year-old
insurgency.
	   The two others cover political and constitutional reforms and
disposition of armed forces.

Tainted liquor kills 45, blinds 25 in southern India
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS : RAISES number of dead, blinded. CORRECTS day of accident to
Saturday sted Sunday in 2d graf. ADDS details; minor editing; No

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Tainted liquor served at a village party
killed 45 people, blinded 25 and put at least 100 others in
hospital in south India, domestic news agencies reported Monday.
	   The dead included eight women in Paruveedhi village in the state
of Tamil Nadu where potent locally brewed liquor bought from a
village shop was served to a large gathering Saturday night, Press
Trust of India quoted police as saying.
	   Five people died Monday and 20 more were in serious condition,
United News of India said.
	   The drink was believed to be a locally made arrack laced with
methyl alcohol to make it more potent, PTI quoted senior police
official Shakeel Akhtar as saying.
	   Eight people have been arrested for manufacturing and selling
the liquor. At least 30 policemen have been suspended in connection
with the tragedy, PTI said, but did not give details of the charges
against them.
	   Liquor poisonings occur frequently in India. Unauthorized
manufacturers mix methyl alcohol with their homemade brew to give
it more punch, but too much can affect the nervous system, causing
blindness or death.
	   Homemade liquor is cheaper than the cheapest brand sold at
authorized shops. Increasing alcohol deaths have also provoked a
violent movement for prohibition in several states in recent years.
	   Village women armed with brooms have publicly thrashed drunkard
husbands and picketed liquor shops, but two provinces which
officially banned liquor had to withdraw the move last year after
huge tax losses to the government.

Police fear Chinese underworld gangs thriving in Japan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Chinese gangs are a growing threat in Japan,
smuggling illegal workers into Japan and carrying out auto theft,
credit-card fraud, muggings and other crimes, police say.
	   Concern over the presence of Chinese underworld gangs has been
heightened by a string of recent arrests.
	   In one, a 40-year-old Chinese man arrested in late June on
charges of violating immigration laws is a suspected leader of the
``Shanghai mafia,'' based in Tokyo's seedy Kabukicho area, the
Yomiuri newspaper reported Monday.
	   The Shanghai mafia is divided into smaller groups, each
specializing in a criminal activity, including thefts, kidnappings
and passport forgery, the report said.
	   One such group tampered with machines for pachinko, or Japanese
pinball, so players could win more money, it said.
	   Police refused to comment on that report, but acknowledge they
have reason to be concerned.
	   Crimes by foreigners in Japan have climbed nearly fivefold in
the last five years, from 4,277 in 1992 to 19,128 last year,
according to a recent report by the National Police Agency.
	   The report, called ``The Quiet Invasion of International
Organized Crime,'' said Chinese gangs are suspected of engineering
much of the smuggling of those seeking better-paying jobs, running
the operation as a lucrative and relatively safe business.
	   It said they charge about 4 million yen (dlrs 28,000) a head.
	   Last week, the Japanese Coast Guard found 98 suspected illegal
immigrants, all believed to be Chinese, hidden in a sweltering
container on board a freighter from Hong Kong.
	   Reports of such stowaways have grown increasingly common.
	   Osamu Ishida, a Tsukuba Women's University professor who has
written books about the Chinese mafia in Japan, says their
influence is swelling.
	   ``This is not something that's happening far, far away. It's
going on right next-door in our neighborhoods,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
	   Ishida estimated the number of Chinese gangs living and working
in Japan in the thousands, perhaps totaling 10,000 or 20,000.
	   ``The Chinese gangs see Japan as the final uncultivated mass
market, after the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe,'' he
said.

 &UR; BAHAMAS: Hurricane strengthens, could threaten eastern United
States &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ Hurricane Bonnie is winding up a 115-mph
(184-kph) punch that might be aimed at the United States.
	   The storm is creeping northwestward across the Atlantic Sunday
on a tack that could threaten the eastern United States,
forecasters are saying.
	   The 115-mph (184-kilometer) winds mean Bonnie is now a Category
3 hurricane and is capable of extensive damage.
	   The storm was moving slowly northwest about 180 miles (290
kilometers) east-northeast of San Salvador in the central Bahamas
Sunday night. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said it might
issue a hurricane watch for the southeast U.S. coast today.
	   ``Bonnie could threaten the east coast of the United States
within the next few days,'' the National Hurricane Center said in a
statement Sunday. The storm's winds were expected to increase.
	   Rough seas caused by the storm slammed three sailboats onto a
beach in Grand Turk, about 220 miles (350 kilometers) southeast of
the storm's center. Residents rescued all 14 people on the boats,
Turks and Caicos police reported.
 &UR; DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Castro meets with old foes, old friends
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Fidel Castro is letting
bygones be bygones.
	   On Sunday, he was visiting and sharing memories with none other
than Joaquin Balaguer, a former Dominican strongman who once
symbolized Castro's isolation in the Caribbean.
	   The two aging foot soldiers of the Cold War spent nearly an hour
jammed into a tiny tan sofa at Balaguer's simple Santo Domingo
home. A small army of security agents and machine gun-toting
soldiers stood guard outside.
	   ``Sitting here, I feel like one of your soldiers,'' Balaguer,
91, joked.
	   On the fourth day of his first visit to the Dominican Republic,
Castro also met with an old friend, former President Juan Bosch,
and Peggy Cabral, widow of the late leftist politician Jose
Francisco Pena Gomez.
	   In the south coast city of Bani late Sunday, Castro paid tribute
to Dominican Gen. Maximo Gomez, who fought for Cuba's independence
from Spain in the late 19th century. Gomez, he declared, is an
example for Caribbean peoples seeking strength through unity and
for small countries still struggling against great world powers _ a
not-so-subtle jab at the United States.
 &UR; DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Lionized, Castro finds satisfaction in lesser
role
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ They've been writing
off Fidel Castro for years. But the old revolutionary is still very
much around.
	   This weekend, the Cuban dictator's saw a crowning as the elder
statesman of the Caribbean _ a region that longs for a role, and
possibly a leader, in a post-Cold War era where it feels adrift.
	   Castro, who three weeks ago toured Jamaica, Barbados and
Grenada, was invited to observe a Caribbean Community summit in the
Dominican Republic _ a country that shares a fascination with Cuba
but shunned Castro during his four decades in power.
	   His real role was far greater. The 72-year-old Castro cast an
imperious shadow over the summit, projecting benign authority as he
lectured against U.S. domination. Aides even distributed pamphlets
of his recent speeches.
	   In the streets of Santo Domingo, people delighted in professing
support for Castro even when opposing communism. The thousands of
Cuban exiles here limited their protest to newspaper advertisements
while some streets filled with signs welcoming ``El Comandante.''
 &UR; BAHAMAS: Women's corpses found on resort island
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ Police on a Bahamian resort island say
they have found corpse of a British tourist and another body that
may be a missing Virginia schoolteacher.
	   The two bodies were found Saturday afternoon on Paradise Island,
a resort area near Nassau. They were in an area of bushes that
separates the island's golf course from a secluded part of Cabbage
Beach.
	   Police identified one of the women as Joanne Clarke, 24, who
disappeared Friday afternoon. Police said she was from Britain but
were unsure of her home town.
	   The other corpse was badly decomposed, and officials said they
would not be able to identify it until after an autopsy on Monday
or Tuesday. However, police superintendent Arnold Josey said it
might be 32-year-old Lori Fogleman, a second grade teacher from
Richmond, Virginia who disappeared July 20.
	   Fogleman's purse was found in late July about a mile from where
the body was discovered. She was last seen driving a silver Nissan
Sentra rental car on Paradise Island.
 &UR; HAITI: Charges of assassination, coup plots multiplying
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ From assasination rumors to
accusations of terrorism, Haiti's political groups are fielding
charges and counter-charges of subversion.
	   In the latest of many unsubstantiated claims, former police
chief Dany Toussaint is accusing two senators of trying to kill
former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide this spring by ramming a
car into the presidential limousine.
	   Last week, police arrested seven people they said were found
with arms and uniforms of the Tonton Macoute militia that supported
the 29-year Duvalier family dictatorship, which was toppled in a
popular uprising in 1986.
	   And last month, the New York magazine Emerge published an
interview with exiled militia leader Emmanuel Constant, who claimed
that fighters for the Front for the Advancement and Progress of
Haiti _ disbanded when the United States invaded four years ago _
were still active.
	   Police have arrested 16 people for plotting subversive acts in
the past month, but many Haitians wonder whether the charges are
well-founded or an excuse to suppress dissent as the Caribbean
nation flounders.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: As hurricane technology improves, human element
still crucial
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Dr. Richard Pasch sits in front of his 25-inch
(64-centimeter) computer monitor, most of which is filled with the
swirling image of Hurricane Bonnie.
	   With a click of his mouse, he centers on the storm's eye, which
has moved very little over the past few hours. To his right,
monitors are running some predicted paths of the hurricane.
	   Pasch, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center
for nine years, puts out advisories every three hours, based on
what he sees.
	   The images Pasch relies on for his forecast come from satellites
and data compiled from reconnaissance planes. It is all part of the
ever-improving technology available to meteorologists.
	   But with all of this technology, the need for an actual person
receiving and deciphering all of the data is crucial.
	   ``There's a human factor that can never be eliminated,'' Naomi
Surgi, a research meteorologist with the National Hurricane Center,
said Sunday. ``You can have the best observing systems out there
and the most advanced modeling systems, but ultimately it's the
forecaster who looks at the data and makes a judgment call.''

Asian markets slide on weakened yen, Russia turmoil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with closing figures; new quotes

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets mostly fell early Monday,
pushed down by a weakened Japanese currency, political turmoil in
Russia, retreating markets in Latin America and Wall Street's
losses on Friday.
	   But Hong Kong stocks soared as the government intervened for the
sixth straight session in an attempt to punish speculators betting
against the market.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index jumped 317.87 points, or 4.2
percent, to 7,845.48. Most of the gains came within 20 minutes of
the market's close.
	   In Japan, concerns about Russia helped drive the dollar as high
as 145.25 yen in the morning, but the greenback slipped to as low
as 144.30 yen as Japanese officials said they may intervene to prop
up their nation's currency.
	   Tokyo stocks also tumbled amid concern about delays in
government efforts to clean up the nation's bad debt-ridden banking
system.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped below the
psychologically-significant 15,000-point level for the first time
in a week, falling 309.84 points, or 2.03 percent, to close at
14,988.36. On Friday, the average fell 93.21 points, or 0.61
percent.
	   ``It's yet to be seen whether the market has already factored in
Russia's instability,'' said Ryohei Muramatsu, treasury manager at
Commerzbank in Tokyo
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Sunday dismantled his Cabinet
and reappointed former Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin, who was
fired five months ago, to pull Russia out of one of its worst
economic crises since the Soviet collapse.
	   The move sparked fears that the International Monetary Fund _
already bailing out South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand _ will not
have enough funds to recue Russia, or will be unable to support
bigger bailouts for member countries if a new regional financial
crisis breaks out.
	   ``There're a lot of short-term investors in the region and
they're getting pretty nervous,'' over Russia, said James Lee, a
derivatives researcher at Lippo Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong.
	   David Shairp, chief economist of Asia at Paribas Asia Equity
Ltd. in Hong Kong, said recent problems in Russia and Latin America
are ``souring industrial opinion of emerging markets,'' prompting
investors to pull out of Asia.
	   He said although direct trade links between Asia and Russia are
limited, investors fear that Asia's banking system will be hurt if
the markets in Europe, Russia's biggest creditor, are further hit
by Russia's financial problems.
	   Shairp added that weaknesses in Latin American markets are also
cutting into the competitiveness of Asian exports in the vast U.S.
markets.
	   In Seoul, the Korea Composite Index closed down 0.18 points at
305.15.
	   ``Although the domestic situation improved with Hyundai's labor
dispute ending, outside factors such as Russia's woes dragged down
market sentiment in the day,'' said Park Yong-bae, an analyst at
KFB Securities Co.
	   Management and workers at Hyundai Motor Co., the nation's
largest automaker, agreed overnight to lay off 277 workers, instead
of the 1,538 workers the automaker originally laid off at the end
of July, ending the monthlong standoff.
	   In Jakarta, the JSX Composite Index opened down 4.7 percent at
370.000 points, as investors dumped stocks of companies related to
the banks closed by the government last week.
	   To revive the crippled banking sector, the government announced
Friday that four state-owned banks will be merged, the several
others frozen, nationalized or recapitalized.
	   In Kuala Lumpur, the key Composite Index dropped 2.6 percent to
315.7 points, as investors remained cautious over new economic
measures the government says it will introduce to help the
country's embattled economy.
	   Last Thursday, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad urged Malaysian
to be prepared when the government announces the new economic
measures, but didn't say what they will be, or when the package
will be presented.
	   In Taiwan, the Weighted Price index plunged 3.5 percent to close
at a 17-month low of 6,957.75 points, amid concerns about the
deterioration in the global economy and listed companies lowering
their earnings forecasts for 1998.
	   In Manila, the key Philippine Stock Exchange index finished 3.6
percent lower at 1,323.11. Singapore's key index, the Straits Times
Industrials Index, closed the morning session 2 percent lower at
914.58 points.
	   Bangkok's Stock Exchange of Thailand index also fell 2 percent
to 234.02 points.

Jordanian Prime Minister to brief King Hussein in Washington
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordanian Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh
left Monday for Washington to meet with King Hussein during a break
in the monarch's treatment for cancer.
	   Tarawneh will brief the king on the latest problems in the
country, a government official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. The prime minister was accompanied by Jawad Anani, chief
of the Royal Court.
	   Hussein has completed his second session of chemotherapy, which
went very well, the official said.
	   The state-run Petra news agency quoted sources at the Mayo
Clinic in Rochester Minnesota, as saying doctors have allowed
Hussein to leave for a few days rest before starting his third
treatment.
	   Hussein entered the Mayo Clinic on July 14 after suffering
persistent bouts of fever. He was diagnosed as suffering from
lymphoma, or cancer of the lymphatic tissue. A hospital statement
said Hussein would receive six chemotherapy treatments, each
lasting four days.

UPDATE with flood waters receding in Harbin, appeal to care for
200,000 flood victims; no pickup.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese flood control officials evacuated areas
along the upper Yangtze River Monday as waters surged to their
highest levels in more than a month of disastrous flooding.
	   Yangtze tributaries swelled by torrential rains that killed at
least 19 people in southwestern Sichuan province last week
converged near the city of Chongqing over the weekend and surged
into a new flood crest, the river's seventh since early July.
	   Officials warned that record high waters _ up to 4.7 meters (15
1/2 feet) above the emergency line _ would lash the upper Yangtze
for the next two days, the state-run China Youth Daily reported.
	   To prevent more casualties in the Yangtze's worst flood season
in 44 years, all people and movable property were ordered away from
a 600-kilometer (350-mile) stretch of the river, the newspaper
said.
	   As the latest flood crest bears down on central China, slightly
receding waters from the last surge of flood waters opened cracks
and undermined waterlogged dikes that protect vital cities and
fertile farmland, state media reported.
	   More than 2,000 people have died in flooding nationwide and
millions others left homeless, according to two-week-old official
figures. Government officials were due to release revised tallies
Tuesday.
	   In an indication that the death count would climb, the tightly
controlled state media stopped using the official figure and
reported deaths in the ``thousands.''
	   To care for the victims and contain any political fallout,
Chinese leaders ordered a crackdown on profiteering and misuse of
relief donations. Chinese have contributed 2.7 billion yuan (dlrs
326 million) to relief efforts, more than 10 times the amount of
aid already distributed by flood control officials.
	   The State Council, China's Cabinet, warned that fraud seemed to
be following the flow of donations and ordered stricter supervision
of funds. Failure to stop the corruption could ``frustrate normal
social order,'' the State Council said in a decree carried by the
official Xinhua News Agency.
	   Major national newspapers highlighted the arrest of company
manager Liu Xiaoqiang in northeast Harbin city for making and
selling substandard life vests. He sold 1,080 of them in
flood-struck Harbin before being caught.
	   Although Harbin, provincial capital of Heilongjiang and a major
industrial center, withstood a week of record high waters in the
Songhua River, rural areas nearby were swamped. Waters receded
slightly overnight as the flood crest moved toward Jiamusi city 300
kilometers (180 miles) down river, Xinhua said.
	   Officials declared imminent victory in saving the country's
largest oil field, 150 kilometers (100 miles) northwest of Harbin,
from inundation.
	   Twenty thousand soldiers completed construction of a new dike to
protect the Daqing oil field from the raging Nen and Songhua
rivers, the China Daily reported. Built after the rivers breached
three other levees, the dike stands a meter (3 feet) above the
flood waters.
	   While the threat to the oil fields diminished, Water Resources
Minister Niu Maosheng reminded Daqing officials they must make sure
200,000 flood victims have food, shelter and medicine, Xinhua
reported.

Siege eased, but tensions still simmering in Hebron
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israel on Monday eased its siege of
Hebron, but Israeli troops enforced a curfew in the downtown area
for a fourth day and fired rubber bullets at Palestinian stone
throwers.
	   Tensions in the divided city have been running high since a
Palestinian stabbed to death a well-known rabbi Thursday night in a
Jewish enclave of Hebron. Israel believe the assailant fled to the
Palestinian-controlled part of Hebron and have demanded that
Palestinian security forces track him down.
	   However, the Palestinians' security chief in the West Bank, Col.
Jibril Rajoub, said Monday he would not help the Israelis.
	   ``It is not our job to protect them (the settlers). The crime
did not happen in an area under our control, so it is not our
responsibility,'' Rajoub told The Associated Press.
	   Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation is one of the
cornerstone of the autonomy agreements, but has flagged during the
17-month deadlock in negotiations on a further Israeli troop
withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   After Thursday night's killing, the army imposed a curfew on the
30,000 Palestinians living in the Israeli-controlled sector.
	   On Monday, troops detained 12 Palestinians after they broke
curfew and lined them up against a wall outside the Jewish enclave
of Beit Romano for an identity check.
	   About a dozen Palestinian children threw stones from rooftops
onto Israeli soldiers in the streets below. Troops fired two rounds
of rubber bullets towards the protesters. There were no reports of
injuries.
	   After Thursday's killing, the army also sealed off all of
Hebron, barring Palestinians from entering on leaving the city. The
army eased the siege Monday, permitting some 6,000 workers and
merchants to leave town and get to jobs in Israel.
	   Hebron is the tensest town in the West Bank and there is
frequent friction between the 450 Jewish settlers and Hebron's
130,000 Palestinian residents.
	   Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, on
Monday published a list of 11 attacks by settlers against
Palestinians in the Hebron area, including beatings and shootings.
	   Tibi said the information was contained in complaints submitted
by victims to Israeli-Palestinian liaison offices in the area.
	   The Jewish community in Hebron is home to several far-right
extremists, including Baruch Marzel, an activist in the outlawed
anti-Arab Kach group. A leader of the Jewish settlement movement,
Aharon Domb, demanded Sunday that Marzel leave Hebron after he
accosted visiting President Ezer Weizman during a condolence visit
and called him a spy.

Chernomyrdin back atop Russian government, Kiriyenko out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yeltsin quotes, Chernomyrdin aide saying
reformers Chubais, Nemtsov unlikely to be in new government.
Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin said Monday he recalled Viktor
Chernomyrdin to head the government because an experienced leader
was needed to tackle Russia's burgeoning crisis and restore
political and economic stability.
	   Chernomyrdin faces an unprecedented economic crisis, a feisty
parliament and a public skeptical that any change at the top can
improve its lot. His reappointment came one week after the Russian
government effectively devalued its national currency, the ruble,
and announced it would restructure the country's short-term debts.
	   A day after he dismissed the government of Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko on Sunday and named Chernomyrdin acting premier, Yeltsin
spoke to the nation in a televised address. He suggested
Chernomyrdin might be the best candidate to succeed him when his
term expires in 2000.
	   ``Today we need those whom we call heavy-weights. I consider
Chernomyrdin's experience and weight essential,'' he said.
	   ``There is another important reason for that proposal, that is,
to ensure continuity of the government in the year 2000,'' Yeltsin
said. ``Viktor Stepanovich's main advantages are decency, honesty,
and thoroughness. I think these qualities will be the decisive
argument in the presidential elections.''
	   Yeltsin asked the parliament to approve his candidate, but
parliamentary leaders announced immediately that they would not
convene a plenary session for at least a week and asked for more
time to consider the appointment.
	   Yeltsin met with Chernomyrdin in his Kremlin office while
Kiriyenko held a farewell meeting with his colleagues in the
government headquarters known as the White House.
	   ``Come to work, come to battle,'' Yeltsin said to Chernomyrdin
as television cameras recorded the start of their meeting.
	   Kiriyenko asked his fellow ministers and deputies ``not to leave
their workplaces and to continue working until replacements are
found'' for them, Interfax reported.
	   ``We simply don't have the right to pauses and intermissions,''
Kiriyenko was quoted as saying.
	   Chernomyrdin started consultations on the make-up of the new
government early Monday. He spoke with regional leaders, including
Gen. Alexander Lebed, the presidential hopeful who is governor of
the Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia. Chernomyrdin was expected to
consult with parliamentary leaders later in the day.
	   ``The first thing I will do as acting head of government is to
analyze the situation on Russia's financial and stock markets,''
Chernomyrdin was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The parliamentary leader of Chernomyrdin's Our Home is Russia
party, Alexander Shokhin, said it was unlikely that prominent
economic reformers Anatoly Chubais and Boris Nemtsov would be in
the new government.
	   Kiriyenko is a 36-year-old former banker who had won respect
from Western economists and some Russians even as he failed to stem
the collapse of the Russian stock market and the steady degradation
of the economy.
	   Although Chernomyrdin is generally respected in political and
business circles, the sudden change seemed likely to further
undermine confidence in Yeltsin's leadership and do nothing to pick
up the spirits of Russians who have gone months without wages.
	   ``The changes in the government will not make the slightest
difference in the situation of Russia's miners, because what we are
going through now is the direct result of the work of Chernomyrdin
and his team,'' said Viktor Semyonov, the leader of a months-long
picket by miners outside the White House.
	   But Lebed, the Krasnoyarsk governor, said he supported
Chernomyrdin's return.
	   ``Today the situation is such that the prime minister of Russia
must be someone from among the political heavyweights. Another
person, even the most talented and smart, can't cope with the
situation since he doesn't have time to gather political weight,''
Lebed said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Chernomyrdin, who headed the Gazprom national gas monopoly
during the Soviet era, was Yeltsin's prime minister and steady
right-hand man from December 1992 until this March, when the
president said Russia needed new, more energetic leadership.
	   Chernomyrdin's government failed to pass comprehensive tax laws,
or stamp out rampant tax evasion among Russian companies.
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said the Chernomyrdin
nomination notwithstanding, the Communist-led majority in the
parliament was still calling for Yeltsin himself to step down and
for wide-ranging discussions on the formation of a coalition
government.
	   Russians who heard the news on an otherwise quiet Sunday evening
expressed resignation at the president's mercurial leadership.
	   ``How can I possibly make sense of it?'' asked Sergei Tikhonov,
a sports magazine editor. ``It's impossible. In America, your
leaders give you reasons for things _ here we're told nothing. What
are we supposed to think?''
	   The ruble dropped 0.135 against the U.S. dollar on the interbank
currency exchange on Monday, to close sharply down at 7.14 rubles
to the dollar.
	   The government was expected to announce the terms of
restructuring the country's short-term debts on Monday. It had
already postponed the announcement for five days under pressure
from foreign investors who fear Russia will offer them a worse deal
than Russian banks.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The government, eager to ward off speculators,
intervened in the stock markets for the sixth consecutive session
Monday in a move that has sparked heated debate in the territory.
	   Traders said aggressive government buying of Hong Kong blue
chips and futures contracts sent the market soaring Monday,
offsetting bearish factors ranging from the weaker Japanese yen and
Russian economic and political turmoil to grim domestic economic
data expected this week.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index gained 317.87 points, or 4.2
percent to finish the volatile day at 7,845.48. Most other stock
markets in the region plunged more than 2 percent in early trading
on a host of negative international and domestic market-moving
news.
	   Although some support the intervention, it has met with
widespread criticism from bankers, economists and politicians, who
say the move contradicts the government's long-standing
non-intervention policy and damages both the market's credibility
and public confidence.
	   Government officials say it is necessary to drive up the market
_ which plummeted to a five-year low earlier this month _ to ward
off speculators who have been betting the market would continue to
fall and driving up interest rates.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The manager of the international
airport in Cambodia's capital has called on the government to halt
direct foreign flights to Siem Reap, home of the ancient Angkorian
temples, a newspaper said Monday.
	   Flights to Siem Reap from Thailand by the small Thai carrier
Bangkok Airways have bitten into the revenues of the capital's
Pochentong airport, managed by a French-Malaysian joint venture.
	   The flights opened last year in an attempt to revitalize the
tourism industry, which plummeted after a coup in the capital by
strongman Hun Sen against his co-prime minister.
	   The general manager of Cambodia Airport Management Services,
which runs Pochentong, was quoted by the Cambodian Daily as saying
during a recent tourist industry meeting that the direct flights to
Siem Reap violate the government's contract with his company.
	   The contract stipulated that Pochentong would be the sole
international air gateway in the small Southeast Asian nation for
20 years.
	   ``Pochentong is a very visible symbol of international
investment, and if we want the confidence of international
investors, there need to be clear rules,'' Eric Chalon was quoted
as saying.
	   The company is the commercial management arm of a venture
between France's Dumez GTM and Malaysia's Muhibbah Masteron Bhd,
which signed a multi-million dollar deal with the Cambodian
government in 1995 to upgrade Pochentong airport.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Unocal Thailand Ltd., a unit of Unocal
Corp., plans to invest dlrs 1.4 billion during the next five years
on natural gas exploration and production in the Gulf of Thailand,
the company said Monday.
	   Brian Marcotte, president of Unocal Thailand, said the main
investment would be for development of the Pailin gas field.
	   During the first phase of the Pailin development, dlrs 400
million will be injected for installation of a central processing
platform, five well-head platforms and a living unit. Another dlrs
200 million will be for project development after the platform
installation.
	   The platform installation will start in September. The company
expects to commence producing gas around next July. Unocal said the
figures and timetables were its best estimates and were subject to
change.
	   The remaining investment budget will be allocated for the second
phase of the Pailin gas field development, which includes
installing another eight platforms as well as the development of 11
gas fields in the Gulf of Thailand.
	   Unocal plans to drill 145 wells per year for its 11 gas fields
in the Gulf of Thailand.
	   Pailin gas field is 35 percent-owned by Unocal Thailand, which
is also an operator of the project. PTT Exploration and Production
PCL holds a 45 percent stake, Amerada Hess International
Exploration 15 percent and Moeco Thai Oil Development Co., an
affiliate of Mitsui and Co., 5 percent.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ What Japanese youngsters want the most now is a
personal computer, according to a think-tank survey released
Monday.
	   In a survey by the Nikkei Research Institute of Industry and
Markets, 41 percent of the respondents said they wanted a personal
computer. A similar survey two years ago found the most wanted item
was a car, the institute said.
	   ``More and more young people are starting to use the Internet,''
said Kunihiko Nagao, a researcher who carried out the study.
	   The survey of 888 people, ages 12 through 29 living in
metropolitan Tokyo, conducted in June, also found that a mini disc
_ a Walkman-type digital disc player _ was also popular among
youngsters, followed by cars and motorcycles.
	    &UR; ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's nationwide supermarket sales in July
totaled 1.480 trillion yen (dlrs 10.4 billion) down 1.4 percent
from the year-earlier month, adjusted for changes in the number of
stores, the Japan Chain Stores Association announced Monday.
	   The association consists of 121 member companies, comprising
7,075 stores throughout Japan.
	   It was the second straight month that supermarket sales had
dropped on the year. Sales fell 2 percent on year in June, after
rising 0.9 percent in May, and 1.8 percent in April. They fell for
twelve straight months through March 1998 following the April 1,
1997 increase in the national sales tax to 5 percent from 3
percent.
	   Food, which makes up the highest proportion of supermarket
sales, totaled 712.62 billion yen (dlrs 4.9 billion), down 0.5
percent from the previous year.

	   ULSAN, South Korea (AP) _ Management and union officials of
strike-bound Hyundai Motor Co. reached a compromise Monday, ending
a 36-day labor dispute at the nation's largest automaker.
	   The compromise allowing ``a minimum level of layoffs'' came in
government-mediated negotiations carried out over the past week. A
breakthrough came when both sides agreed on terms of the layoffs in
overnight talks.
	   ``The past one month was truly agonizing. I hope this will be an
opportunity for both labor and management to live together
peacefully,'' union leader Kim Kwang-shik told a news conference.
	   Labor Minister Lee Ki-ho, who led the last-minute mediations,
praised the compromise, calling it ``a great victory achieved
through dialogue and concessions.''
	   Hyundai's 26,000-strong union walked off their jobs July 20 in
protest of the company's plan to lay off 1,538 workers. Hyundai had
shed 6,100 workers earlier this year through early retirements.
	   But the compromise raised questions about South Korea's ability
to ensure a flexible labor market, a key to wooing back much-needed
foreign investment. It was criticized by some as being too
pro-labor.
	   Major business organizations, including the Korea Managers'
Federation, blasted the government, accusing it of siding with the
union because of the political risks involved in using police force
to break up strikes.

Share prices surge

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices rose sharply Monday, with the key
index soaring 4.2 percent as the Hong Kong government continued to
prop up the market in its battle with speculators.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
rose 317.87 points to close at 7,845.48. On Friday, the index had
214.92 points.
	   Turnover rose to 9.80 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.2
billion), up from Friday's 4.97 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 637 million).
	   Brokers said share prices surged in the last 20 minutes of
trading after hovering in negative territory for most of the
session.
	   ``It's very obvious there has been government invervention''
after most Asian markets fell on news of political and financial
turmoil in Russia, said Steve Lo, dealing director at OSK Asia
Securities Ltd.
	   Brokers said the government wants to move the index higher ahead
of the August futures contract expiry on Friday to hurt
speculators, who have been betting the market would continue to
fall.
	   Among properties, Cheung Kong rose 1 Hong Kong dollar to 34.00,
and Sun Hung Kai Properties rose 60 cents to 25.65.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings rose 13 dollars to 178.00,
and Hang Seng Bank rose 3.30 dollars to 43.70.
	   Elsewhere, Swire Pacific ``A'' rose 1.35 dollars to 23.70, and

flames Monday as clashes between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian
rebels moved the closest yet to the capital of the secessionist
province in southern Serbia.
	   Loud booms of tank fire resounded from Agura and smoke enveloped
the village 5 kilometers (3 miles) off the southwestern edge of
Pristina. Houses were burning, apparently targeted in a Serb attack
that could be heard from the capital starting late Sunday.
	   The area was blocked off by Serb police, making it impossible to
determine if rebels were fighting back or whether it was part of
the Serbs' scorch-and-burn tactics after overrunning KLA
strongholds.
	   The assault appeared to be part of a new offensive launched
southwest of the capital on Sunday by Serb forces, hoping to crush
a rebellion by militant ethnic Albanians.
	   Pristina has escaped the escalated fighting that has killed
hundreds of people and displaced an estimated 230,000 from their
homes since the Serbs launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian
rebels early this year.
	   Serb forces have also sent Kosovo Liberation Army fighters
fleeing in an all-out push since mid-July, forcing the heavily
outmanned KLA to regroup and change tactics.
	   In an interview published Monday, a rebel representative
acknowledged that the KLA will now rely on guerrilla warfare to win
the province's independence from Serbia, adding ``We will strike in
every corner of Kosovo.''
	   Adem Demaci told the Vienna news magazine Profil that the rebels
had made the ``fatal mistake'' of trying to ``defend a territory
they cannot defend.'' Instead, they want to launch surprise
strikes.
	   He said he is ready to start negotiations with Serb authorities
``when certain conditions are fulfilled'' _ primarily the end of
Serb attacks.
	   But the Serbian government says it will never negotiate with the
Kosovo ``terrorists.''
	   Ethnic Albanians comprise about 90 percent of the population of
Kosovo, where most want independence from Serbia, the dominant
republic in the Yugoslav Federation.
	   On Sunday, in the southwestern town of Studencane, KLA
commanders said Serb fighters were targeting villages across a
15-kilometer (nearly 10-mile front) southwest of Pristina.
	   The attacks were thought to be in retaliation for reported KLA
attacks Saturday and early Sunday on Serb police and a Yugoslav
army unit in the same region.
	   Civilians in the area _ which includes the villages of Pecane,
Recane, Studencane, and Samodraza _ fled Sunday's shelling. Dozens
of tractors moved along a dirt road toward nearby Pirane, pulling
trailers overloaded with women and children, blankets and other
household goods.
	   Meanwhile, in Skopje, Macedonia, the premiers of Macedonia and
Albania, both concerned with a spillover of violence from nearby
Kosovo, pledged to preserve peace in their countries.
	   ``The crisis in Kosovo has caused concern, and Macedonia and
Albanian have most reasons to worry,'' Macedonian Prime Minister
Branko Crvenkovski said Sunday, wrapping up a two-day visit by his
Albanian counterpart, Fatos Nano.

Siege eased, but tensions still simmering in Hebron
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israel on Monday eased its siege of
Hebron, but Israeli troops enforced a curfew in the downtown area
for a fourth day and fired rubber bullets at Palestinian stone
throwers.
	   Tensions in the divided city have been running high since a
Palestinian allegedly killed a well-known rabbi Thursday night in a
Jewish enclave of Hebron. Israeli authorities believe the assailant
fled to the Palestinian-controlled part of Hebron and have demanded
that Palestinian security forces track him down.
	   However, the Palestinian security chief in the West Bank, Col.
Jibril Rajoub, said Monday he would not help the Israelis.
	   ``It is not our job to protect them (the settlers). The crime
did not happen in an area under our control, so it is not our
responsibility,'' Rajoub told The Associated Press.
	   Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation is one of the
cornerstones of the autonomy agreements, but has flagged during the
17-month deadlock in negotiations on a further Israeli troop
withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   After Thursday night's killing, the army imposed a curfew on the
30,000 Palestinians living in the Israeli-controlled sector.
	   On Monday, troops detained 12 Palestinians after they broke
curfew and lined them up against a wall outside the Jewish enclave
of Beit Romano for an identity check.
	   About a dozen Palestinian children threw stones from rooftops
onto the Israeli soldiers. Troops fired two rubber bullets toward
the protesters. There were no reports of injuries.
	   After Thursday's killing, the army also sealed off all of
Hebron, barring Palestinians from entering on leaving the city. The
army eased the siege Monday, permitting some 6,000 workers and
merchants to leave town and go to jobs in Israel.
	   Hebron is the tensest town in the West Bank and there is
frequent friction between the 450 Jewish settlers and Hebron's
130,000 Palestinian residents.
	   Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, on
Monday published a list of 11 attacks by settlers against
Palestinians in the Hebron area, including beatings and shootings.
	   Tibi said the information was contained in complaints submitted
by victims to Israeli-Palestinian liaison offices in the area.
	   The Jewish community in Hebron is home to several far-right
extremists, including Baruch Marzel, an activist in the outlawed
anti-Arab Kach group. A leader of the Jewish settlement movement,
Aharon Domb, demanded Sunday that Marzel leave Hebron after he
accosted visiting President Ezer Weizman during a condolence visit
and called him a spy.

</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Suu Kyi's party urging end to
standoff

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's
political party urged her Monday to end a 13-day roadside standoff
with authorities because of her failing health.
	   The appeal came as political pressure increased against the
military regime when some 200 students in Yangon staged the first
anti-government street protest in two years. The crowd fled when
truckloads of police arrived. No arrests were reported.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, was last seen by her personal physicians Friday on
a bridge 32 kilometers (19 miles) outside Yangon where her van has
been halted since Aug. 12. They said she was suffering low blood
pressure, kidney and urinary tract problems and dizziness.
	   The National League for Democracy said in a statement Monday
that the military regime had since refused permission for doctors
and the party chairman, Aung Shwe, to visit her.
	   ``Since Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's health is of concern, members of
the NLD and sympathizers of the NLD strongly wish the general
secretary to return to Yangon,'' the statement said. Daw is an
honorific.
	   It was unclear how the message, signed by the party's central
executive committee, would reach Suu Kyi.
	   Last week, the party had demanded that the government release
party members jailed since May as a condition for Suu Kyi to end
the the standoff. As of Sunday, party officials said none had been
freed.
	   Suu Kyi had set a deadline of last Friday for the government to
convene the parliament elected in 1990. The vote was overwhelmingly
won by the opposition, and the military never allowed the
legislature to meet.
	   The deadline passed without action. The party then said it would
call the parliament without permission, an action that the
government said Monday would be illegal.
	   Past attempts by the NLD to gather members of parliament have
been met with mass arrests.
	   Earlier Monday, the government warned the opposition that its
plans would jeopardize possible talks with military leaders. The
military has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962.
	   ``Such an action by any individual party would be in
contravention of Myanmar law, and seems designed to derail the
ongoing discussions between the government and the National League
for Democracy,'' said a government spokesman on condition of
anonymity.
	   Suu Kyi's roadside protest has highlighted the restrictions on
her movements. The Nobel Peace Prize winner and three colleagues
were trying to travel to the western city of Bassein to meet party
members for the fourth time in two months. They have never been
allowed to proceed.
	   The military held out an olive branch to the NLD earlier this
month when Gen. Khin Nyunt, one of the ruling junta's most powerful
generals, met face to face with Aung Shwe.
	   Previous attempts at furthering discussions failed, however,
when the general refused to include Suu Kyi, something her party _
and the international community _ has demanded.
	   ``The government hopes sincerely to continue meetings started
last week with the NLD,'' said the spokesman, but warned against
any ``radical and provocative actions by NLD leaders.''

Malaysian opposition MP prepares for prison

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ An opposition member of Parliament
appealed to a federal court Monday to overturn his prison sentence
on charges of sedition for having criticized the Malaysian
judiciary.
	   Lim Guan Eng, deputy secretary-general of the Democratic Action
Party and a member of Parliament for 12 years, would be the first
sitting Malaysian MP to be sent to prison.
	   The case is being watched closely by human rights activists and
representatives of Amnesty International and the International
Community of Jurists attended the hearing.
	   Lim, 38, was convicted last year of sedition and printing
``false news'' in a pamphlet distributed in 1995 entitled, ``The
True Story.''
	   In it, he criticized the government's decision not to press
statutory rape charges against Abdul Rahim Tamby Chik, a former
chief minister of Lim's home state, Malacca.
	   The pamphlet questioned why the 15-year-old girl involved in the
scandal was detained for more than two years, but not Abdul Rahim,
a leading member of the ruling United Malays National Organization.
	   A three-judge panel of the Federal Court of Appeal on Monday
adjourned the hearing until Tuesday, when the defense will have its
final rebuttal.
	   The panel must decide whether to uphold a sentence of two
concurrent 18-month prison terms, set by a lower appellate court.
	   Public prosecutor Azhar Mohamad argued the stiff sentence would
send a message to Malaysians that they could not spread false news
and get off lightly.
	   ``His words could be exploited by irresponsible elements and
could cause chaos,'' Azhar said of Lim. He said a reversal of the
lower court ruling would ``undermine the credibility and the
integrity of the judiciary.''
	   Hundreds of Lim supporters surrounded the federal courthouse
dressed in white T-shirts printed with the word ``Freedom'' and
caps that read ``Justice.'' Some stood silently with DAP decals
taped across their mouths.
	   Lim said he was prepared to go to prison.
	   ``I'm very hopeful that justice will prevail,'' he told The AP
during a break in the hearing. ``Even if it doesn't, I'm prepared
to go down for justice and women's rights. That's a cause worth
fighting for, worth going down for.''
	   The grandmother of the alleged victim attended the hearing. She
said her granddaughter had been detained for a month in jail and
then sent to a home for juveniles for two years.
	   The police maintain the girl was in protective custody, but the
grandmother said the girl was being held to keep her quiet.
	   ``Those who have done wrong have not been arrested,'' said the
woman who asked not to be identified to protect her granddaughter.
``Those who are wrong are free.''
	   Lim's original sentence called for a 15,000 ringgit (dlrs 3,570)
fine. It was dismissed and replaced with a jail term by the Court
of Appeal in April, when Lim lost his first appeal.
	   Judge Gopal Sri Ram, in announcing that court's decision, said:
``It is time that the court sends a clear message that it cannot
tolerate any attack on the judiciary.''
	   Lim's father, Lim Kit Siang, is head of the DAP and the
opposition leader of Parliament. He called on the Federal Court to
reconsider his son's appeal before a bench of at least five judges.
	   The three-member panel denied the request Monday.
	   ``On Aug. 24, it is not only Guan Eng who will be on trial, the
system of justice in Malaysia will also be on trial -- not only in
the eyes of Malaysian's, but also in the eyes of the world,'' the
elder Lim said.
	   Lim's lead defense attorney Karpal Singh asked the court to set
aside or at least reduce the prison term. Eighteen months, he said,
``is a clear case of overkill.''

Magistrate acquits two defendants of charges of killing Briton
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYERI, Kenya (AP) _ A magistrate on Monday aquitted two
defendants charged with killing a British tourist on the grounds of
insufficient evidence.
	   Magistrate Julius Mushelle said there was only circumstantial
evidence linking the defendants to the slaying and could not
convict them.
	   ``In this case, it stands that the circumstantial evidence is
not sufficient to convict the accused persons. There is no direct
evidence,'' he said. ``I therefore acquit them.''
	   Both defendants had signed confessions admitting the Feb. 15
stabbing death of Roy Chivers during a robbery at the Aberdare
Country Club in central Kenya.
	   But Peter Hiuhu Gachau and Simon Njoroge Wairimu later retracted
the confessions, claiming police had tortured them into admitting
guilt.
	   Both men represented themselves during the trial.
	   Chivers' wife, Sandra Christine, who was with her husband at the
time of the attack, was unable to identify the defendants in a
police lineup before the trial opened May 7. She said she had been
in a state of shock and everything happened quickly.
	   On July 17, police testified that blood samples taken from the
clothing of one of the defendants did not match the victim's blood
type.
	   Chivers, 50, of Orpington, Kent, was stabbed in the chest while
strolling with his wife on the grounds of the the country club, 130
kilometers (80 miles) north of Nairobi. He died while being flown
to a Nairobi hospital.
	   The defendants were also charged with robbing the Chivers' of
two cameras and a pair of binoculars.
	   Last month, Mushelle convicted the same two men for the robbery
and murder of a Kenyan farmer.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Top officials from four former Soviet republics in
Central Asia have agreed to coordinate efforts to defend their
countries against the influence of the Taliban Islamic army in
nearby Afghanistan, a news agency reported Monday.
	   The defense and foreign ministers from Uzbekistan, Kazakstan,
Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan met in the Uzbek capital of Tashkent on
Saturday to discuss ``possible scenarios, measures, and assistance,
including military assistance,'' among the Central Asian states,
Tajik Ambassador to Uzbekistan Tadzhitdin Mardonov told the
Interfax news agency.
	   The leaders also debated how to combat Islamic extremism and
``forces that cover themselves with Islamic slogans,'' Mardonov
said.
	   Russia and the former Soviet republics in Central Asia fear an
influx of refugees and weapons across their borders from
Afghanistan, and possibly a spillover of fighting.

	   Government officials said Monday that Suu Kyi returned to Yangon
of her own free will with her two physicians accompanying her.
	   The appeal from Suu Kyi's party for her to end her protest came
as political pressure was stepped up against the military regime
when some 200 students in Yangon staged the first anti-government
street protest in two years. The crowd fled when truckloads of
police arrived. No arrests were reported.

 &UR; YANGON: extremely rare

<TEXT>
	   Before Monday, Suu Kyi, 53, was last seen by her personal
physicians Friday on a bridge 32 kilometers (19 miles) outside
Yangon where her van has been halted since Aug. 12. They said she
was suffering low blood pressure, kidney and urinary tract problems
and dizziness.
	   The National League for Democracy said in a statement Monday
that the military regime had since refused permission for doctors
and the party chairman, Aung Shwe, to visit her.
	   ``Since Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's health is of concern, members of
the NLD and sympathizers of the NLD strongly wish the general
secretary to return to Yangon,'' the statement said. Daw is an
honorific.
	   It was unclear how the message, signed by the party's central
executive committee, would reach Suu Kyi.
	   Last week, the party had demanded that the government release
party members jailed since May as a condition for Suu Kyi to end
the the standoff. As of Sunday, party officials said none had been
freed.

<TEXT>
	   Suu Kyi had set a deadline of last Friday for the government to
convene the parliament elected in 1990. The vote was overwhelmingly
won by the opposition, and the military never allowed the
legislature to meet.
	   The deadline passed without action. The party then said it would
call the parliament without permission, an action that the
government said Monday would be illegal.
	   Past attempts by the NLD to gather members of parliament have
been met with mass arrests.
	   Earlier Monday, the government warned the opposition that its
plans would jeopardize possible talks with military leaders. The
military has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962.
	   ``Such an action by any individual party would be in
contravention of Myanmar law, and seems designed to derail the
ongoing discussions between the government and the National League
for Democracy,'' said a government spokesman on condition of
anonymity.
	   Suu Kyi's roadside protest has highlighted the restrictions on
her movements. The Nobel Peace Prize winner and three colleagues
were trying to travel to the western city of Bassein to meet party
members for the fourth time in two months. They have never been
allowed to proceed.
	   The military held out an olive branch to the NLD earlier this
month when Gen. Khin Nyunt, one of the ruling junta's most powerful
generals, met face to face with Aung Shwe.
	   Previous attempts at furthering discussions failed, however,
when the general refused to include Suu Kyi, something her party _
and the international community _ has demanded.
	   ``The government hopes sincerely to continue meetings started
last week with the NLD,'' said the spokesman, but warned against
any ``radical and provocative actions by NLD leaders.''

New airport handles all air cargo for first time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's troubled new airport on Monday
began handling all air cargo for the first time since it opened in
early July, the main cargo handler said.
	   The start of full cargo services came eight days ahead of the
schedule arranged by Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Ltd. and the
government.
	   Serious computer and mechanical glitches at the new Chek Lap Kok
airport had crippled air cargo transport, forcing the cargo handler
to move parts of the operation back to the old Kai Tak airport.
	   Anthony Charter, the company's manager director, has said the
terminal is well-prepared for the start of the territory's peak
cargo handling in September.
	   Officials estimated the cargo problems might have cost the
territory 0.35 percent of this year's gross domestic product.
	   Cathay Pacific Airways, which reported earlier this year its
first ever loss, said the cargo problems cost it 250 million Hong
Kong dollars (dlrs 32 million) in revenue in July alone.
	   The airport problems sparked serious public criticism of both
government officials and the cargo handler. The company said it was
under extreme pressure from officials to open even before it was
ready.
	   Three separate investigations are under way to find out what
went wrong and who was responsible.

Kohl confident about new Russian premier
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Russia-Politics &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl voiced trust in
Russia's new premier Monday and urged him to press ahead with
economic reforms to stem the nation's financial crisis.
	   Kohl ``has faith that Viktor Chernomyrdin can push through the
necessary decisions in view of the dramatic and serious situation
in Russia,'' his spokesman Otto Hauser said in a statement.
	   He said Kohl has confidence in Chernomyrdin after ``years of
good cooperation'' in the past.
	   Separately, a leading International Monetary Fund official was
quoted as blaming the Russian crisis on Kohl's refusal to seek an
international bailout.
	   The situation in Russia became ``untenable'' after leading
industrial nations refused to rush to its aid, IMF deputy director
Stanley Fischer told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
	   ``Without the Germans, of course no other European country was
prepared to support Russia financially,'' he said.
	   ``I'm not sure whether Chancellor Helmut Kohl wouldn't have
acted differently if elections were two years away and not six
weeks,'' he said.
	   Kohl is trailing his Social Democratic Part challenger, Gerhard
Schroeder, in opinion polls ahead of federal elections on Sept. 27.
Germany has enormous exposure in Russia, largely in the form of
direct credit and credit guarantees.

Forest fire in Canary Islands chars pine forest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTA CRUZ DE TENERIFE, Canary Islands (AP) _ Hundreds of
firefighters backed by helicopters battled Monday to put out a
blaze that has charred 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres) of pine forest
on the Spanish island of Tenerife.
	   Some 300 firemen from all over the Canary Islands archipelago
joined Red Cross workers and volunteers battling the flames in
rugged, hilly terrain in the south of the island, a spokeswoman for
the Tenerife government said.
	   Six helicopters were dropping water on the fire, which broke out
Sunday for unknown reasons.
	   The blaze is not threatening any town, but officials did
evacuate a camp ground called Madre del Agua, or Mother of Water.
	   In July, a forest fire in the Catalonia region of northeast
Spain charred 27,000 hectares (67,000 acres) of forest, scrubland
and crops.

 &UR; Suu Kyi ends protest
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series, edits

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Her health failing, Nobel laureate Aung
San Suu Kyi heeded an appeal from her political party and returned
home Monday afternoon ending a 13-day roadside standoff with the
military government over her right to travel outside Yangon.
	   Leaders of Suu Kyi's political party, the National League for
Democracy, urged her earlier in the day to end the protest because
of concerns over her health which had been deteriorating in recent
days.
	   Suu Kyi's doctors said she was suffering from kidney problems,
low blood pressure, dizziness and urinary tract problems when they
were allowed to examine her Friday.
	   Government officials said Monday that Suu Kyi returned to Yangon
of her own free will with two personal physicians accompanying her
in her van.
	   The appeal from Suu Kyi's party for her to end her protest came
as political pressure was stepped up against the military regime
when some 200 students in Yangon staged the first anti-government
street protest in two years. The crowd fled when truckloads of
police arrived. No arrests were reported.
	   Also on Monday, the Minister of Home Affairs met with two
members of the NLD's central executive committee, the party said.
	   Minister Tin Hlaing had requested a meeting NLD Chairman Aung
Shwe. Aung Shwe sent two unidentified central committee members his
place.
	   The NLD said only that the two sides met and ``expressed their

Yangon where her van has been halted since Aug. 12. The government
denied the doctors access to Suu Kyi on Saturday and Sunday.
	   The National League for Democracy said in a statement Monday
that the military regime had since refused permission for doctors

	   ``Since Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's health is of concern, members of

	   Last week, the party had demanded that the government release

	   The NLD had set a deadline of last Friday for the government to

percent of the seats. The military refused to honor the vote.
	   The deadline passed without action. The party then said it would

Indonesian intelligence chief finds no evidence of rapes during
</HEADLINE>
riots

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Investigators have failed to find any
evidence that rapes occurred during riots in Jakarta in May and
reports of sexual abuse may have been fabricated, a top military
official said Monday.
	   Women's rights groups have alleged that at least 168 women and
girls, mainly from Indonesia's Chinese minority, were raped during
the riots, in which 1,200 people were killed.
	   But Lt. Gen. Moetojib, chief of state intelligence, said his
agents visited the sites of alleged rapes and had inquired at many
hospitals around the city that may have treated victims.
	   ``None can provide evidence that the incidents occurred in the
middle of May,'' Moetojib said after meeting President B.J.
Habibie. Not one woman reported to security officials that she had
been raped, he said.
	   Thousands of Chinese-owned homes, stores and buildings were
burned and looted in the violence which led to the resignation of
autocratic President Suharto.
	   The reports of rapes helped galvanize outrage against Indonesia
among ethnic Chinese worldwide. Anti-Indonesian protests have been
held in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, the United
States and elsewhere.
	   Habibie publicly condemned the alleged rapes after Beijing
demanded that his government bring those responsible to justice.
	   Moetojib, however, said he believed the reports were fabricated.
	   ``I have come to the conclusion that the rumors were spread for
political purposes to defame Indonesia in the international arena
and to disintegrate national unity,'' he said.
	   He added that some rumors may have been spread through the
Internet.
	   Investigators probing deadly riots last May have cast doubt on
the authenticity of some graphic photographs on the Internet
showing Muslim men and soldiers raping Chinese women. Chinese are
mostly Christian or Buddhist.
	   Marzuki Darusman, who heads Indonesia's National Commission on
Human Rights as well as a government-ordered inquiry into May's
violence, said Thursday that some pictures could be fakes.
	   Chinese make up only about four percent of Indonesia's 202
million population. However, they dominate the country's economy
and have been made scapegoats for the worst economic crisis in 30
years.

June retail sales fall 16 percent for eighth consecutive month

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Retail sales fell 16 percent in June from the
same month last year, marking the eighth consecutive monthly
decline since October when consumer confidence began to falter, the
government announced Monday.
	   Retail sales fell to an estimated 15.9 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 2.05 billion). Volume also fell by 16 percent compared
with last June.
	   A government statement attributed the continued double-digit
decline to ``the prevailing subdued consumer sentiment'' and a
decline in tourism to the territory. High consumer spending in June
1997 also made for a relatively high base of comparison, the
statement said.
	   The sales volume of commodities in department stores posted the
biggest fall, losing 29 percent in value and 30 percent in volume
year-on-year, followed by sales of clothing and footwear, which
fell 29 percent in both volume and value.
	   Motor vehicle sales fell 34 percent in value and 28 percent in
volume year-on-year, while miscellaneous consumer goods lost 9
percent in value and 13 percent in volume year-on-year.
	   Hong Kong's economy, hit the Asian financial crisis, contracted
2.8 percent in the first quarter. The government is expected to
announce a further contraction in the second quarter Friday when it
releases its first half economic report.
	   Unemployment in the territory is at a 15-year high at 4.8
percent. A survey earlier this month conducted by the Hong Kong
Department Stores and Commercial Staff General Union indicated
unemployment in the retail sector had reached 17 percent.
	   Tourist arrivals jumped out of the red in July for the first
time this year. Arrivals were up 26.5 percent compared with July
last year when the tourist slump began.

Israel softens position on key issue, progress on pullback seen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a sign of behind-the-scenes progress, Israel
has softened its position on a key precondition for withdrawing
from more land in the West Bank, an official said Monday.
	   The report of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's new
flexibility on procedure comes as U.S. envoy Dennis Ross is
exploring the possibility of a new round of mediation to wrap up
the long-stalled withdrawal agreement.
	   Hardliners in Netanyahu's coalition, meanwhile, renewed threats
to topple the government if he acceded to a U.S. proposal to hand
over an additional 13 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian
control.
	   According to an Israeli official who spoke on condition of
anonymity, Israel told U.S. negotiators that it would now agree to
start the withdrawal process without a new meeting of the
545-member Palestine National Council.
	   Netanyahu has demanded the PNC be reconvened to remove ambiguity
about whether it had canceled clauses in the PLO founding charter
which call for Israel's destruction. Palestinians have maintained
the PNC already took action to revoke the charter.
	   The official said Israel was now willing to accept a statement
from the 18-member PLO executive committee as a condition for
starting the withdrawal as long as a date for reconvening the PNC
would fall within the four-month period of phased pullbacks.
	   Netanyahu's office issued a statement denying an Israeli
newspaper report that the prime minister had reversed his stand on
the PLO charter.
	   It said that Netanyahu spoke to U.S. President Bill Clinton
about the issue Friday and said that amending the charter ``is a
basic condition of the agreement with the Palestinians.''
	   In the Norwegian capital of Oslo, Ross was expected to meet with
Palestinian Authority president Yasser Arafat and Netanyahu's
advisers. Afterwards, U.S. officials are expected to weigh the
feasibility of a new Mideast shuttle mission.
	   ``We've had a stalemate for a very long time, and it's very
important that we overcome that stalemate,'' Ross said in an
interview with the Norwegian state broadcast network NRK.
	   A Palestinian official said a secret channel had been opened
between Netanyahu confidant Yitzhak Molcho, and Ahmed Qureia, the
speaker of the Palestinian legislative council.
	   The official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said a
compromise on the PLO charter had been proposed by Israel.
	   But the official suggested there was no progress on another key
issue _ Israeli restrictions on Palestinian use of 3 percent of the
land targeted for withdrawal. Israel insists that Palestinians not
be allowed to build in the area, the official said.
	   Netanyahu said in an interview with Fox News television that the
process had reached a ``critical stage.''
	   A group of 11 hard liners in Netanyahu's coalition, meanwhile,
called a meeting in the Knesset Monday in response to Israeli media
reports of progress in the negotiations.
	   The group, known has the Greater Land of Israel Front, has
pledged to topple Netanyahu's government should he agree to a 13
percent pullback.
	   ``We are holding this meeting to signal to the prime minister,
in case he has a short memory, that his coalition will not allow
him to do something against the wishes of the people who elected
him,'' Michael Kleiner, head of the group and a member of the
Gesher Party, told The Associated Press.
	   Netanyahu controls 66 of 120 seats in parliament, and the
Kleiner group could topple him.

U.S. asks security cooperation with Sudan, el-Bashir says
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The United States has asked to open
security cooperation with Sudan and assured it last week's attack
on a Khartoum factory was aimed at terrorism, not at the Sudanese
government, the country's president said Monday.
	   President Omar Hassan el-Bashir made the comments in his first
news conference since Thursday's strike on a factory that U.S.
officials said manufactures chemical weapons agents but Sudan
insists makes only medicines.
	   He said that the U.S. government had communicated with Sudan
through a third party, which he would not name, to say that his
country was ``not targeted in the attack, but terrorism.''
	   ``They also said that they wanted cooperation between the
Sudanese and the American security apparatus, and this happens for
the first time although they have refused a similar request we made
in the past,'' el-Bashir said.
	   U.S. officials have not said anything publicly about renewing
cooperation with Sudan, which it accuses of being a terrorist
sponsoring state. America officials have not made clear if they are
accusing Sudan of being linked to the targeted factory.
	   President Clinton tied the factory to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi
dissident blamed for the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania that killed 257 people on Aug. 7. A second U.S. attack was
carried out Thursday against bin Laden's bases in Afghanistan.
	   But el-Bashir said that bin Laden ``has no shares at all in the
factory,'' adding bin Laden left Sudan before the factory was
opened in 1996. Bin Laden lived in Sudan in the early 1990s but was
forced out under Western pressure in 1995.
	   El-Bashir said the Americans based the attack on wrong
information supplied by dissidents who have opposed his Islamic
rule since he came to power in a coup in 1989.
	   ``The American agencies have counted on erroneous information
from some groups ... in return for giving them money,'' he said,
calling the opposition groups ``traitors and agents working against
their homeland.''
	   He also said the attack was carried out ``to cover up for the
Monica scandal,'' a reference to Clinton's affair with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky.
	   Despite his criticism of the Clinton administration, el-Bashir
insisted private U.S. enterprises were not threatened in his
country.
	   ``We have no animosity towards the American people and
non-government agencies,'' he said. ``Our measures are aimed at the
American government and not the people.'' He declined to elaborate
on what measures he might take against the government.
	   El-Bashir repeated an invitation to a U.N. fact-finding mission
to inspect the factory, said to have supplied 50 percent of Sudan's
drugs.
	   But he said no other site would be open to inspection since
``the issue at hand is to investigate American allegations of
chemical materials being produced at the factory.''
	   El-Bashir said the third party dealing with the United States
has suggested asking the U.S. government to ``apologize for its
crime and pledge a considerable compensation for all those harmed
in the aggression.''
	   He did not say what Khartoum's response was, but Information
Minister Ghazi Salah el-Din told reporters Sunday that Sudan
insists on a ``public apology'' from the United States.

Hyundai's compromise creates more problems for Korea Inc.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: With BC-SKorea-Hyundai &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A prolonged labor dispute at Hyundai
Motor Co. ended with a controversial government-mediated deal
Monday but it created more problems for Korea Inc. as a whole,
analysts said.
	   Many analysts saw the deal as a major victory for South Korea's
militant unions which have been fighting against layoffs,
guaranteed by a new law adopted early this year.
	   The new law was a key part of reforms South Korea promised to
make in return for a record dlrs 58 billion bailout of its economy
by the International Monetary Fund in December.
	   The deal that limited Hyundai's layoffs to ``a minimum level''
cast serious doubts on South Korea's ability to ensure a flexible
labor market promised to the IMF, a key to wooing back badly needed
foreign investment.
	   An exodus of foreign investors late last year fueled a currency
crisis in South Korea, forcing the country to turn to outside help
to bail out its economy.
	   ``How can we expect foreign investment when layoffs are so
difficult?'' asked Lee Woo-yong, an economics professor at Sogang
University.
	   After shedding 6,100 workers through early retirement early this
year, Hyundai wanted to lay off 1,538 more. Under Monday's
compromise, it was allowed to lay off only 277 workers, with the
remaining 1,261 put on 1 1/2 years of unpaid leave.
	   Analysts criticized the government-mediated compromise as an
open invitation for Korean unions to freely choose to strike in any
future industrial disputes.
	   ``This is very promising for labor unions. The lesson they
learned from the strike is: do it, we have nothing to lose,'' said
Tae Chung, head researcher at French brokerage SG Securities in
Seoul.
	   ``Labor unions will use it as a tool to resist layoff plans and
now management has weaker bargaining power,'' he said.
	   Analysts were also critical of the government's heavy
involvement in mediating, although it earlier had declared the
strike to be illegal.
	   Major business organizations, including the Korea Managers'
Federation, blasted the government, accusing it of siding with the
union because of the political risks involved in using police force
to break up strikes.
	   ``The compromise is expected to negatively affect South Korea's
foreign credibility, because it has set a bad precedent, in which
the legally guaranteed layoffs can be blocked by a union's illegal
acts of violence,'' the federation said in a statement.
	   Hyundai Motor, the nation's largest automaker with an annual
production capacity of 1.65 million vehicles, was the first major
business to shed redundant workers. Observers saw Hyundai as a test
of South Korea's will to keep its promise to ensure a flexible
labor market.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A village outside Pristina was in
flames Monday as clashes between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian
rebels moved the closest yet to the capital of the secessionist
province in southern Serbia.
	   Loud booms of tank fire resounded from Agura and smoke enveloped
the village 5 kilometers (3 miles) off the southwestern edge of
Pristina. Houses were burning, apparently targeted in a Serb attack
that could be heard from the capital starting late Sunday.
	   The area was blocked off by Serb police, making it impossible to
determine if rebels were fighting back or whether it was part of
the Serbs' scorch-and-burn tactics after overrunning KLA
strongholds.
	   But the Kosovo Information Center, close to the province's
ethnic leadership, said Serb tanks positioned in the hills were
shelling an extended area along the main road southwest of
Pristina. The center said two ethnic Albanians were killed in
Sunday's fighting near the town of Suva Reka.

U.S.troops flying from Alaska to parachute on Thai monkey town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ U.S. troops based in Alaska will fly 16
hours to Thailand and parachute Wednesday into a province famed for
its large monkey population.
	   Forty-two Thai paratroopers will join the 408 U.S. troops from
the 1st Battalion, 501st Parachute Infantry Regt., from Alaska's
Fort Richardson, the U.S. Embassy said in a press statement.
	   The exercise, dubbed Black Tiger, includes parachuting the
troops into a drop zone in Lopburi province, 115 kilometers (72
miles) north of Bangkok, where the Thai army maintains a special
warfare command.
	   Lopburi is famed for its monkeys, which freely wander the
streets of the provincial capital of the same name, as well as the
surrounding countryside.
	   Lt. Col. James Moon of the U.S. Army was cited as saying that
the exercise would sharpen flexibility in meeting contingencies
that range from humanitarian assistance to evacuation of U.S.
citizens.
	   The U.S. troops will return to Alaska the same day.

Israel increases security at airports following threats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOD, Israel (AP) _ Israel is tightening security at its airports
in response to threats by Islamic militants to attack Israeli and
U.S. targets, including airlines, officials said Monday.
	   Threats against U.S. and Israeli targets emerged after last
week's U.S. air strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan that were aimed at
Osama bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire and Islamic militant linked to
the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa this month.
	   On Sunday, a leading Muslim activist close to bin Laden said
Islamic militants are preparing to retaliate for the air strikes by
targeting U.S. and Israeli strategic sites and airliners.
	   Pini Shis, a spokesman for Israel's Airport Authority, said
security was being tightened at Ben Gurion International Airport
near Tel Aviv and at airfields in Eilat and Tel Aviv.
	   ``Since the American activity in Afghanistan and Sudan, security
measures have been increased in Israeli airports,'' Shis told The
Associated Press. He would not specify what measures had been
taken.
	   Israel radio said cars entering Ben Gurion airport were being
checked more closely and some delays were reported in getting into
the airport.
	   In a related development, the Haaretz daily said that metal
detectors at Ben Gurion do not pick up certain items that contain
metal, including kitchen knives and big key chains.
	   Haaretz tested the five metal detectors in the departure hall
twice and found that the equipment did not pick up on metal items
weighing about 350 grams, or a little over half a pound.
	   Shis said security officials are aware that metal detectors
cannot alert security to every metal object.
	   ``Metal detectors are not the final answer in preventing terror
attacks,'' Shis told The Associated Press. ``The machines are only
one link in an entire chain of security measures.''
	   Shis would not specify which other means are used to check if a
person is carrying weapons.
	   Security measures at Ben Gurion are among the most stringent
worldwide. Motorists are stopped at checkpoints at the airport
entrances, with some passengers _ generally Palestinians _ being
questioned there and having their luggage checked.
	   In the departure lounge, tourists, Palestinians and Israeli Arab
citizens are questioned at length, while Jewish Israelis usually
undergo only a perfunctory check.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a sign of behind-the-scenes progress, Israel

Renewal of sanctions is baseless, says Iraqi paper
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In Iraq's first reaction to the U.N.
decision to extend sanctions on the country, a government daily
said Monday that the Security Council move was made out of habit,
not from an investigation of the facts.
	   Al-Thawra, the newspaper of the ruling Baath Party, also said
Iraq would not back down from its decision to refuse to deal with
U.N. arms inspectors until all U.N. sanctions on the country are
lifted.
	   On Friday, the Security Council decided in its bi-monthly review
of the sanctions to extend the trade embargo for two months and
complained about Iraq's failure to deal with the inspectors.
	   ``The decision which is repeated for the last few years does not
have any logical basis and was not taken after deep and serious
discussions,'' said the editorial in Al-Thawra.
	   It said the Security Council did not consider ``the fact that

ACB monitors Pakistan security
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Australia's Cricket Board (ACB) has
sought advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs about next
month's tour of Pakistan because of United States bombings in
neighboring Afghanistan.
	   Australia's cricketers are due to arrive in Pakistan on Sept. 23
for three tests and three limited overs matches with another
limited overs series in between in Bangladesh.
	   Security concerns have heightened since the U.S. undertook
military strikes against alleged terrorist facilities in
Afghanistan and Sudan.
	   ``We've sent a letter off to foreign affairs although we had
been in touch with them last week before the bombings when the
Americans began pulling their people out,'' team manager Steve
Bernard said. ``Right now things are in train and we will be guided
by any information from foreign affairs, the high commission, the
Pakistani board and so on.''
	   A foreign affairs spokesman said the situation in Pakistan and
Afghanistan was being monitored and reviewed on a daily basis.
	   The current advice was to defer all nonessential travel to
Pakistan.
	   ``Our travel advices are under constant review and we will
monitor the situation in the coming days,'' the spokesman said.
	   Australia refused to travel to Sri Lanka for the first game of
the 1996 cricket World Cup after seeking advice from foreign
affairs and the high commission in Colombo after bombings in that
city.
	   Bernard said it was unlikely the Pakistan tour would be called
off but that the safety of the players and team management was
paramount.
	   He said a decision on the tour could be left as late as a few
days before departure.
	   ``I'd imagine that it's not something they would pull out of
immediately but you'd have to watch it fairly closely,'' Bernard
said. ``I would think they will monitor it until fairly close to
the tour before making a decision.''
	   The second test will be played in Peshawar near the Afghanistan
border and Khyber Pass.
	   Australia has had trouble in Peshawar before when players were
belted with projectiles, including bottles and a padlock, during a
one-day game against South Africa the last time they traveled to
Pakistan in 1994.
	   Bernard and ACB operations manager Richard Watson went to
Pakistan earlier this month to seek assurances from Pakistan
cricket chief Majid Khan that the players would be safe. Bernard
said they were happy with all tour details.

Pakistan cautious on report missile found
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The Pakistani government was cautious
Monday in the face of reports an unexploded U.S. missile had been
found in western Pakistan, after a similar report turned out to be
false.
	   Local officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
missile was found in a remote area Sunday and handed over to the
military the same day, four days after U.S. missiles struck a
suspected militant training camp in neighboring Afghanistan. They
said the missile fell in Kharan, some 600 kilometers (375 miles)
south of the U.S. target near Khost, Afghanistan.
	   No injuries or damage was reported. Few other details were
available.
	   Spokesmen for the foreign ministry and the military said Monday
that the report could not be confirmed.
	   Pakistan had protested the presumed violation of its air space
in the U.S. attack, and said earlier a missile had mistakenly
fallen in Pakistan and killed several people. The government fired
its intelligence chief, Manzoor Ahmed, for passing on that false
report to the prime minister.
	   The United States fired 73 Tomahawk missiles at six targets in a
camp in eastern Afghanistan linked to Saudi dissident Osama bin
Laden. Bin Laden is accused of directing worldwide terror attacks
from Afghanistan, including the Aug. 7 bombings of two U.S.
embassies in East Africa that killed a total of 257 people.
	   The 18-foot (5-meter) Tomahawk is capable of carrying up to
1,000 pounds (450 kilograms) of explosives.
	   The attack on a neighboring, fellow-Muslim country has prompted
daily anti-American protests around Pakistan. Monday, about 200
Afghan refugee schoolgirls led by their veiled teachers chanted
``destroy America!'' in a peaceful march in the Pakistani border
city of Peshawar, which has seen the largest and most violent
protests.
	   Also Monday, an Italian military plane picked up the body of a
U.N. military observer killed by unknown gunmen in Afghanistan a
day after the attacks. An international honor guard of other
military observers escorted the coffin, draped in a blue U.N. flag,
onto the plane in the Pakistani capital.
	   Most foreign workers for the U.N. mission to Afghanistan and
other groups have left Afghanistan, where anti-Western
demonstrations have been held in several cities since the attack.

Myanmar domestic airliner missing with 39 passengers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ A Myanmar Airways domestic flight
carrying 39 passengers disappeared Monday while flying to the
northern city of Tachilek, government officials said.
	   No further details were available from the government.
	   Tachilek, 560 kilometers (350 miles) north of Yangon, straddles
the border with Thailand. It sits in the mountainous region of Shan
State in the opium-rich Golden Triangle, the area where the borders
of Myanmar, Thailand and Laos converge.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, is currently in its monsoon season
although it is not known if weather played a part in the plane's
disappearance.

Renewal of sanctions is baseless, says Iraqi paper
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In Iraq's first reaction to the U.N.
decision to extend sanctions on the country, a government daily
said Monday that the Security Council move was made out of habit,
not from an investigation of the facts.
	   Al-Thawra, the newspaper of the ruling Baath Party, also said
Iraq would not back down from its decision to refuse to deal with
U.N. arms inspectors until all U.N. sanctions on the country are
lifted.
	   On Friday, the Security Council decided in its bimonthly review
of the sanctions to extend the trade embargo for two months and
complained about Iraq's failure to deal with the inspectors.
	   ``The decision which is repeated for the last few years does not
have any logical basis and was not taken after deep and serious
discussions,'' said the editorial in Al-Thawra.
	   It said the Security Council did not consider ``the fact that
Iraq has complied with the commitments forced on it for the lifting
of the sanctions.''
	   The sanctions, imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait,
prohibit the country from freely exporting oil, its most valuable
commodity. Under U.N. resolutions, the sanctions cannot be lifted
until arms inspectors certify Iraq has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction.
	   The government of President Saddam Hussein has long maintain it
has complied with the resolutions, but arms inspectors accuse Iraq
of hiding weapons and the means to make more.
	   Al-Thawra added the government would stand by its Aug. 5
decision to refuse to cooperate with arms inspectors, accusing
chief arms inspector Richard Butler of working ``as hard as
possible to hid the truth about Iraq's compliance.''
	   ``Our stand is solid and unchangeable as long as Butler refuses
to tell the Security Council that ... Iraq is empty of prohibited
weapons and cannot resume production of such weapons after the
destruction of the machines and factories related to the
production,'' said Al-Thawra.
	   The Security Council was expected to meet Monday to be brief by
U.N. special envoy Prakash Shah, who visited Baghdad last week but
said he failed to convince the Iraqis to change their stand on arms
inspections.

U.S. asks security cooperation with Sudan, el-Bashir says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos planned &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The United States has asked to increase
security cooperation with Sudan and assured the country's leaders
that last week's attack on a Khartoum factory was aimed at
terrorism, not at the government, the country's president said
Monday.
	   President Omar Hassan el-Bashir made the comments in his first
news conference since Thursday's strike on a factory that U.S.
officials said manufactured chemical weapons agents. Sudan insists
the plant made only medicines.
	   He said that the U.S. government had communicated with Sudan
through a third party, which he would not name, to say that his
country was ``not targeted in the attack, but terrorism.''
	   ``They also said that they wanted cooperation between the
Sudanese and the American security apparatus, and this happens for
the first time although they have refused a similar request we made
in the past,'' el-Bashir said.
	   U.S. officials have not said anything publicly about renewing
cooperation with Sudan, which it accuses of being a sponsor of
terrorism. American officials have not made clear if they are
accusing the Sudanese government of being linked to the targeted
factory.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton tied the factory to Osama bin Laden,
the Saudi dissident blamed for the bombings of U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania that killed 257 people on Aug. 7. A second U.S.
attack was carried out Thursday against bin Laden's bases in
Afghanistan.
	   But el-Bashir said that bin Laden ``has no shares at all in the
factory,'' adding bin Laden left Sudan before the factory was
opened in 1996. Bin Laden lived in Sudan in the early 1990s but was
forced out under Western pressure in 1995.
	   El-Bashir said the Americans based the attack on wrong
information supplied by dissidents who have opposed his Islamic
rule since he came to power in a coup in 1989.
	   ``The American agencies have counted on erroneous information
from some groups ... in return for giving them money,'' he said,
calling the opposition groups ``traitors and agents working against
their homeland.''
	   Despite his criticism of the Clinton administration, el-Bashir
insisted private U.S. enterprises were not threatened in his
country.
	   ``We have no animosity towards the American people and
non-government agencies,'' he said. ``Our measures are aimed at the
American government and not the people.'' He declined to elaborate
on what measures he might take against the government.
	   El-Bashir repeated an invitation to a U.N. fact-finding mission
to inspect the factory, said to have supplied 50 percent of Sudan's
drugs.
	   But he said no other site would be open to inspection since
``the issue at hand is to investigate American allegations of
chemical materials being produced at the factory.''
	   El-Bashir said the third party dealing with the United States
has suggested asking the U.S. government to ``apologize for its
crime and pledge a considerable compensation for all those harmed
in the aggression.''
	   He did not say what Khartoum's response was, but Information
Minister Ghazi Salah el-Din told reporters Sunday that Sudan
insists on a ``public apology'' from the United States.

Two killed in explosion in Georgian administration building
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ A bomb exploded in a regional
administration building near the border with breakaway Abkhazia on
Monday, killing a woman and child and injuring 30 other people,
officials said.
	   The blast in the town of Zugdidi occurred shortly after noon in
a four-story building that houses the regional government and
several other offices. At least two people were killed, said
regional police chief Col. Shakro Berishvili.
	   The force of the explosion was equivalent to at least five
kilograms (11 pounds) of TNT, he said.
	   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.
	   Following the blast, authorities were tightening security in
street markets, the post office and other administration buildings
in Zugdidi.
	   The region has been plagued by violence since Abkhazia's
13-month war for independence ended in 1993. Sporadic clashes
between separatists and forces loyal to Georgia's central
government have also continued, despite the Russian peacekeepers
stationed in the region.

Asian markets slide on weakened yen, Russia turmoil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing figures for all markets, TRIMS

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets slumped Monday on the
back of a weakened Japanese currency, political turmoil in Russia,
retreating markets in Latin America and Wall Street's losses on
Friday.
	   But Hong Kong stocks soared as the government intervened for the
sixth straight session in an attempt to punish speculators betting
against the market.
	   Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng Index jumped 317.87 points, or
4.2 percent, to 7,845.48. Most of the gains came in the last 20
minutes of trading.
	   Indonesian shares tumbled, with the key Composite Index falling
4.6 percent, or 17.800 points, to close at 370.545.
	   In Japan, concerns about Russia pushed the U.S. dollar higher.
It was trading at 144.40 yen in late afternoon, up 1.46 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo but below its New York rate of 144.91 yen late
Friday.
	   Tokyo stocks also tumbled amid concern about delays in
government efforts to clean up the nation's bad debt-ridden banking
system.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped below the
psychologically-significant 15,000-point level for the first time
in a week, falling 309.84 points, or 2.03 percent, to close at
14,988.36. On Friday, the average fell 93.21 points, or 0.61
percent.
	   ``It's yet to be seen whether the market has already factored in
Russia's instability,'' said Ryohei Muramatsu, treasury manager at
Commerzbank in Tokyo
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Sunday dismantled his Cabinet
and reappointed former Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin, who was
fired five months ago, to pull Russia out of one of its worst
economic crises since the Soviet collapse.
	   The move sparked fears that the International Monetary Fund _
already bailing out South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand _ will not
have enough funds to rescue Russia, or will be unable to support
bigger bailouts for member countries if a new regional financial
crisis breaks out.
	   ``There are a lot of short-term investors in the region and
they're getting pretty nervous,'' over Russia, said James Lee, a
derivatives researcher at Lippo Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong.
	   David Shairp, chief economist of Asia at Paribas Asia Equity
Ltd. in Hong Kong, said recent problems in Russia and Latin America
are ``souring industrial opinion of emerging markets,'' prompting
investors to pull out of Asia.
	   In Taiwan, the Weighted Stock Price Index plunged 3.5 percent to
close at a 17-month low of 6,957.75, amid concerns about the
deterioration in the global economy.
	   Elsewhere:
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower as news of political
uncertainty in Russia and retreating markets of Latin America shook
investor confidence. The Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 49.49
points, or 3.6 percent, to 1,323.11.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares closed lower on growing anxiety
of the stability of global stock markets. The benchmark Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 6.86 points, or 2.1
percent, to 317.20.
	   BANGKOK: Thai stock prices closed lower on uncertainty over
Russia's economic and political instability. The Stock Exchange of
Thailand index fell 4.77 points, or 2.4 percent, to 233.15.
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed lower. The Straits Times Industrial
Index fell 1.7 percent, or 15.85 points, to 917.31.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower in reaction to
a rise in short-term interest rates and deteriorating global
economic conditions. The NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 45.72 points,
or 2.2 percent, to 1,955.78.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower. The All Ordinaries
Index fell 33.2 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,601.8.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed mixed after management and union
officials of strike-bound Hyundai Motor Co. reached a compromise,
ending a 36-day labor dispute at South Korea's largest automaker.
The Korea Composite Stock Price Index slipped 0.18 point to 305.15.

Japanese journalists complaint to government over grenade attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Journalists from four Japanese news
organizations launched a complaint Monday with Cambodia's Interior
Ministry for refusing to return a camera, film and videotape seized
after a deadly grenade attack last week.
	   A Cambodian driver for Japan's Kyodo News Service was killed in
the attack Thursday, when a grenade was thrown by unknown
assailants in front of the ministry as opposition politician Sam
Rainsy was staging a protest against alleged election fraud.
	   After the attack, police trained their guns at the Phnom Penh
correspondents of Kyodo, Yomiuri Shimbun, NHK and Nihon Denpa News,
forcing them to hand over videotape, a camera and several rolls of
film.
	   The Japanese journalists, who were covering Sam Rainsy's
protest, said much of the immediate aftermath of the grenade attack
was captured. Repeated efforts to retrieve the camera, film and
tape have failed.
	   ``We consider that action a clear violation of the press law,''
the four journalists wrote Monday to the co-interior ministers, Sar
Kheng and You Hockry.
	   Authorities have so far agreed only to giving back censored
versions of the film and tape. The offer has been refused by the
Japanese correspondents.
	   Ministry officials said Monday they will not return the film and
tape until they determine if the correspondents were trespassing.
They also said they may need it as evidence if the assailants are
ever found.
	   The journalists said they showed their press passes to Interior
Ministry guards before they were admitted onto the premises
Thursday.
	   Sam Rainsy and the country's other main opposition leader,
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, have protested strongman Hun Sen's
victory in parliamentary elections last month.
	   Sam Rainsy has alleged that people close to Hun Sen's ruling
political party were behind Thursday's attack, meant as a warning
against anyone challenging the results.

Mubarak meets with U.S. Senator Biden
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALEXANDRIA, Egypt (AP) _ President Hosni Mubarak met Monday with
U.S. Senator Joseph Biden, a Delaware Democrat, to discuss the U.S.
strikes against Sudan and Afghanistan and the Middle East peace
process.
	   Biden, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told
reporters that the two men also talked about Mubarak's idea for
convening an international conference on terrorism. Biden said he
thought it to be a positive suggestion.
	   Egypt has not joined several other Arab states in condemning the
U.S. attack, which hit a Khartoum factory and suspected training
camps for Muslim militants in Afghanistan. But it has said such
actions should be taken through the United Nations, not
unilaterally.
	   U.S. officials maintain the targeted factory makes chemical
weapons agents, while Sudan insists it manufactures only medicines.
U.S. officials linked the factory to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi
dissident blamed for the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania.
	   Biden said that he listened to Mubarak's ``advice on a number of
issues,'' mostly about the Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations.
He said they also discussed Egyptian-U.S. relations.
	   The senator expressed hope that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu would accept a U.S. initiative calling for an Israeli
withdrawal from 13.1 percent of the West Bank.
	   Reaffirming the U.S. commitment to the peace process, he said
U.S. Mideast peace coordinator Dennis Ross was in Oslo for talks
between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli negotiators.

Philippine peso, stocks down

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine peso closed lower
against the U.S. dollar Monday as early losses by the yen dampened
trading, dealers said.
	   A modest recovery in the yen in trading later Monday failed to
pull up the local currency, according to dealers.
	   The dollar averaged 43.173 pesos in the Philippine Dealing
System, up 51.9 centavos from Friday's rate of 42.654 pesos. The
dollar was last traded at a day-high rate of 43.30 pesos.
	   Volume of trading reached dlrs 122.6 million compared to
Friday's dlrs 140.1 million.
	   Weakness in the yen caused by political uncertainties in Russia
prompted market participants to hold on to their dollars said a
trader with a foreign bank.
	   Dealers said the peso would likely remain near its current level
unless there was a sharp declines in other Asian currencies.
	   A stable peso-dollar rate last week enabled the Philippine
Central Bank effective Monday to cut its overnight borrowing and
lending rates by two percentage points each to 16 percent and 18
percent.
	   Philippine shares, meanwhile, ended sharply lower Monday, hurt
by news of Russia's troubles and retreating markets in Latin
America, traders said. The peso's early retreat also contributed to
the decline.
	   Preliminary figures showed the 3-share Philippine Stock Exchange
dropped 49.49 points, or 3.6 percent, to 1323.11 following an
18.33-point retreat to 1372.60 on Friday.
	   The broader All Shares Index was off 11.97 points to 433.42
after losing one point to 445.39 Friday.
	   Losers beat gainers 67 to 13, with 29 issues unchanged.
	   Helen Alvarez, research director at All Asia Securities Corp.,
said the Russian ruble's devaluation raised fears on the future of
large European banks with exposures in Russia. The retreat of
markets in Latin America also contributed to the pessimism.
	   Hansley See, analyst for Abacus Securities Corp., said the
market's advance last week now appears to have been temporary.
	   ``Investors are more averse to risk. They're putting their funds
in safer havens such as treasuries and the dollar,'' he said.
	   See said a weakening peso and anticipation of poor second
quarter economic earnings were also weighing on the market.
	   The Philippine government will release second quarter economic
data on Friday, which is expected to show a further slowdown in the
economy.

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets mostly fell early Monday,
pushed down by a weakened Japanese currency, political turmoil in
Russia, retreating markets in Latin America and Wall Street's
losses on Friday. But Hong Kong stocks soared as the government
intervened for the sixth straight session in an attempt to punish
speculators betting against the market. The blue-chip Hang Seng
Index jumped 317.87 points, or 4.2 percent, to 7,845.48. Most of
the gains came within 20 minutes of the market's close. In Japan,
the dollar slipped to as low as 144.30 yen as Japanese officials
said they may intervene to prop up their nation's currency. Tokyo
stocks also tumbled amid concern about delays in government efforts
to clean up the nation's bad debt-ridden banking system. The
benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped below the
important 15,000-point level for the first time in a week, falling
309.84 points, or 2.03 percent, to close at 14,988.36. (ASIAN

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin said Monday he recalled Viktor
Chernomyrdin to head the government because Russia needed an
experienced leader to restore political and economic stability.
Chernomyrdin faces an unprecedented economic crisis, a feisty
parliament and a public skeptical that any change at the top can
improve its lot. His reappointment came one week after the Russian
government effectively devalued its national currency, the ruble,
and announced it would restructure the country's short-term debts.
A day after he dismissed the government of Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko on Sunday and named Chernomyrdin acting premier, Yeltsin
suggested Chernomyrdin might be the best candidate to succeed him
when his term expires in 2000. Yeltsin asked the parliament to
approve his candidate, but parliamentary leaders announced
immediately that they would not convene a plenary session for at
least a week and asked for more time to consider the appointment.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Monetary Authority of Singapore, the
country's de facto central bank, said Monday it will continue to
manage the Singapore dollar with more flexibility as currencies
across Southeast Asia grow more volatile. In its annual report, the
MAS said its primary policy goal is to maintain price stability and
confidence in the Singapore dollar while safeguarding export
competitiveness. Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said Sunday night
that the depreciation of the Singapore dollar is not a solution in
the current currency crisis. The report said that despite a sharp
decline in the Singapore dollar against the U.S. dollar, on a
trade-weighted basis the Singapore currency has appreciated
slightly since the regional crisis erupted in July 1997. The
country's strong economic fundamentals kept the Singapore dollar
from falling as low as other regional currencies, the report said.

	   DENVER (AP) _ A 13-state strike against U S West has entered its
second week, while a strike against another U.S. telephone company
_ Southern New England Telecommunications Corp. _ entered its first
day. Talks continued into the evening Sunday without a settlement
between US West and the union representing 34,000 workers who
walked off the job Aug. 16. The country's sixth-largest telephone
company said the Communication Workers of America has refused to
discuss any of the issues that forced the walkout. The union denied
the charge. Federal mediator Jim Mahon had ordered the negotiations
to resume Sunday. Both sides met for five hours before breaking.
They gave no word on when they would meet next. Strikers walked off
their jobs over forced overtime, health benefits and a plan to tie
pay to job performance. U S West has about 25 million customers.
More than 6,000 workers walked off their jobs at SNET, which serves
nearly 3 million residents in the northeastern state of
Connecticut. (US-US WEST STRIKE)
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine expects the approval of a dlrs 2.2
billion IMF loan next week that would help the country overcome a
financial crisis, President Leonid Kuchma said Sunday. Kuchma
quoted IMF managing director Michel Camdessus as telling him in a
weekend telephone conversation that ``the IMF shall not leave
Ukraine alone with its problems at this difficult time.'' Ukraine
is experiencing a deep financial crisis caused by its massive
foreign borrowing, the lack of foreign investors and inability to
collect billions of dollars in tax debts. The crisis has been
aggravated by the ruble devaluation in Russia, which in turn pushed
the Ukrainian hryvna down against the U.S. dollar and raised fears
of further investor exodus and damage to trade with Moscow,
Ukraine's principal trade partner. Kuchma, speaking on the eve of
Ukraine's Independence Day, vowed that the former Soviet republic
would overcome the crisis, the Interfax news agency reported.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo's Angolan allies have driven rebel
forces from a string of Atlantic coast towns in a stunning reversal
of rebel gains, a senior government adviser said Monday. Buoyed by
recent successes, the government rejected a weekend cease-fire
proposal, insisting all Rwanda and Ugandan troops must first
withdraw from Congolese territory. South Africa and other member
state of the South African Development Community called for the
cease-fire during a hastily called weekend peace summit in
Pretoria. In Kinshasa, a second ministry-level official said
Angolan forces fighting on Kabila's behalf had taken control of the
oil port town of Muanda and the nearby town of Banana. The
insurgents, who accuse President Laurent Kabila of power-grabbing,
tribalism and mismanagement, have pushed to within 30 kilometers
(18 miles) of Kinshasa and still control the town of Mbanza-Ngungu,
the last major obstacle before the capital. (CONGO)
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan _ The United States has asked to increase
security cooperation with Sudan and assured it that last week's
attack on a Khartoum factory was not aimed at the government but at
fighting terrorism, Sudan's president says Monday. President Omar
Hassan el-Bashir made the comments in his first news conference
since Thursday's strike on a factory that U.S. officials said
manufacturmn tied the factory
to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi dissident blamed for the bombings of
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 257 people on Aug.
7. El-Bashir said bin Laden had no links to the factory and said
the attack was based on wrong information supplied by dissidents
opposed to his Islamic rule. (SUDAN-US)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A village outside Pristina was in
flames Monday as clashes between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian
rebels moved closer to the capital of the secessionist province in
southern Serbia. Loud booms of tank fire resounded from Agura and
smoke enveloped the village five kilometers (three miles) southwest
of Pristina. The area was blocked off by Serb police, making it
impossible to determine if rebels were fighting back or whether it
was part of the Serbs' scorch-and-burn tactics after overrunning
strongholds of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. Pristina has so
far escaped the escalated fighting that has killed hundreds of
people and displaced an estimated 230,000 from their homes since
the Serbs launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian rebels early this
year. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Her health failing, Nobel laureate Aung
San Suu Kyi heeded an appeal from her political party and returned
home Monday afternoon ending a 13-day roadside standoff with the
military government over her right to travel outside the capital.
Leaders of Suu Kyi's political party, the National League for
Democracy, urged her earlier in the day to end the protest because
of concerns over her health which had been deteriorating in recent
days. The appeal from Suu Kyi's party for her to end her protest
came as some 200 students in Yangon staged the first antigovernment
street protest in two years. The crowd fled when truckloads of
police arrived. Last week, the party had demanded that the
government release party members jailed since May as a condition
for Suu Kyi to end the standoff. As of Sunday, party officials said
none had been freed. (MYANMAR-SUU KYI)
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The Clinton administration has agreed to
allow two Libyans charged in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103
over Lockerbie to be tried by a Scottish court convened in the
Netherlands, the Los Angeles Times reported Monday. Moammar Kadafi
has refused to turn over the two men accused in the bombing that
killed all 259 passengers and crew, saying they would not receive a
fair trial in the U.S. or Britain. His regime has long sought a
compromise location and an international panel of judges. Officials
said they have held behind-the-scenes discussions with the Dutch
government and other third parties for months. The British agreed
to the new approach, the newspaper reported. Libya, however, has
not yet accepted the arrangement, the Times said. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright was to notify families of the victims of
the decision in a conference call Monday, according to families who
have been told of the plan, the Times reported. (US-PAN AM BOMBING)

Angola's former rebels cut ties with US, Russia, Portugal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The former rebel movement UNITA said
Monday it was ceasing all contact with U.S., Russian and Portuguese
observers who are monitoring Angola's peace process for the United
Nations.
	   UNITA's policy committee accused the three nations of showing
bias towards the Angolan government, UNITA's foe during the
country's civil war, in the implementation of a 1994 peace accord.
	   The countries were acting in their own economic interests in
this oil- and diamond-rich country, UNITA said in a written
statement issued from its central highland stronghold Bailundo and
faxed to The Associated Press.
	   UNITA said the observer nations had ``disqualified themselves
totally (from the peace process) by not abiding by the criteria of
neutrality ... and impartiality.''
	   The observer countries participate in meetings of the
Luanda-based Joint Commission, which monitors the implementation of
the U.N.-brokered 1994 peace accord which ended two decades of
fighting between the government and UNITA.
	   The Joint Commission also includes representatives of the
government, UNITA and the United Nations.
	   UNITA Secretary-General Paulo Lukamba Gato said by telephone
from Bailundo that his group would still attend Joint Commission
meetings but would not talk to officials from the observer
countries.
	   Officials of the three observer nations had no immediate
comment.
	   The United Nations Security Council has accused UNITA of
dragging its feet in implementing the peace deal and has imposed
sanctions against the group.
	   The peace agreement established the three countries as observers
because of their historic involvement in this southwest African
nation.
	   Portugal was the colonial ruler before granting independence in
1975. During the Cold War, the U.S. supported UNITA and the Soviet
Union backed the then-Marxist government, providing funds and
military equipment.
	   UNITA said in the statement that it remained committed to the
peace pact which has been stymied by lingering hostility between
the former foes. Its implementation is more than a year behind
schedule.
	   The U.S. last month imposed new economic sanctions on UNITA,
including a freeze on their bank accounts, to force the former
rebels to fulfill all terms of the peace accord. UNITA stills
controls four central highland towns which it was supposed to hand
back to the government.
	   UNITA said U.S. policy was ``simply ridiculous and unwise.''
	   The movement said Russia had flaunted the so-called
``triple-zero option'' of the peace accord under which the three
observer nations pledged not to sell arms to either side. The
Angolan government recently signed a military cooperation deal,
including weapons maintenance, with Russia.
	   The statement accused Portugal of siding with the government
against UNITA.

Vietnam still preparing with two days to go
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam, a late choice to host the Tiger
Cup, is still wrapping up a flurry of preparations with only two
days left before the regional soccer tournament begins, officials
said Monday.
	   ``They have done their very best to organize this tournament in
such a short time,'' ASEAN Football Federation spokesman Windsor
John told a news conference. ``There is still some work to be
done.''
	   A deal on hosting the eight-nation competition was only
concluded in early July. It originally was to be held in Indonesia,
but the country's economic and political turmoil led organizers to
seek a new site.
	   The Tiger Cup is challenging Vietnam's organizational skills for
an international gathering, especially on such short notice.
	   It is believed to be the country's biggest-ever sporting event
and will be the first soccer doubleheader here. About 3,000 foreign
spectators are expected, along with 37 foreign reporters.
	   The competition will be televised live in the region, including
the opening ceremonies that will be delayed until after the first
match is over Wednesday to provide greater exposure.
	   Vietnam Football Federation officials said that despite a dlrs
400,000 infusion from the ASEAN federation, they will lose money
because of all the work that has been required to upgrade the host
stadiums in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.
	   But they said it is worth it if the competition spurs teams _
particularly Vietnam's _ to raise the level of their play in
advance of the 2002 World Cup, the first to be held in Asia.
	   Soccer is a national obsession in Vietnam, even though the
country never has qualified for the World Cup. The sport has been a
financial and organizational success in Asia that has not
translated into success on the field, just the opposite of Africa's
situation.
	   Malaysia and Singapore will kick off the tournament at 4:15 p.m.
(0915 GMT) Wednesday in Hanoi, with Laos and Vietnam wrapping up
the first day of Group B in a night match.
	   Thailand, Myanmar, Indonesia and the Philippines start Group A
play Thursday in Ho Chi Minh City.
	   Matches will be played almost daily until the championship and
consolation matches Sept. 5.
	   Security will be tight. About 300 police would be deployed for a
regular match in Vietnam, but the number will be four to five times
as high for the Tiger Cup.
	   Bottles and cans are banned from the stadiums, each of which

Arrest of Turkish mafia boss reveals further state-underworld

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit has
confirmed that a prominent crime figure avoided arrest and traveled
freely around the world using a diplomatic passport, reports said
Monday.
	   Alaattin Cakici, wanted in Turkey on charges of murder, was
nabbed Aug 17 in a hotel in Nice by French police . Turkey is
preparing to ask for his extradition.
	   Ecevit said the diplomatic passport was given to Cakici by an
intelligence official at the Turkish embassy in Beijing, China,
Milliyet newspaper reported.
	   The disclosure was the latest episode in a wider scandal
surrounding state-underworld links and raised calls for a deeper
investigation to unravel state officials links to the crime world.
	   Last year a government report concluded that the state had hired
right-wing terrorists to carry out covert operations against
national threats. The document said the death squads later grew out
of control, carrying out attacks on their own initiatives and
dabbling in mafia-style crime.
	   The scandal has so far involved two parliamentary deputies, a
dozen policemen and an army sergeant. Many more are believed to be
involved.
	   The opposition center-right True Path Party has claimed Cakici
was in contact with two lawmakers of the ruling Motherland Party.
	   Social democrat politician Fikri Saglar said he would ask
Parliament to probe Cakici's relationships with state officials.
	   ``It is a serious concern to us that certain state officials or
institutions who gave Cakici the diplomatic passport and other
facilities will try and cover up the issue and destroy key
evidence,'' newspapers quoted Saglar as saying.
	   Cakici was allegedly hired in the early 1980's to fight an
Armenian organization that launched attacks on Turkish embassy
staff. He made headlines more recently confessing on television
from his hiding place that he ordered his men to carry out attacks.
	   News reports suggested France may refuse to extradite him
because faces possible death penalty in Turkey.

Ukraine marks Independence Day with military parade

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Thousands of jubilant Ukrainians thronged
the capital's central avenue Monday as armed vehicles and tactical
missiles rolled by to celebrate the seventh anniversary of
Ukraine's independence.
	   Though modest, the parade was Ukraine's largest military show
since the former Soviet republic declared independence on Aug. 21,
1991, days after the failed hard-line Communist putsch.
	   ``The seven years that have passed since that day are a whole
epoch ... during which we have created all the elements of
statehood,'' Defense Minister Oleksandr Kuzmuk told the troops.
	   Kuzmuk stood next to President Leonid Kuchma and watched some
5,000 soldiers march through the recently renovated, chestnut-lined
Khreshchatik. Kiev's central avenue was destroyed in World War II,
then rebuilt under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.
	   Children waved small blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flags and
marchers in historical Cossack dress stood at attention as 129
military vehicles and mobile rocket launchers made their
appearance.
	   The military displayed Giatsint-B artillery pieces, 11-meter
(yard) long R-300 missiles that can hit a target 300 kilometers
(186 miles) away, Osa anti-aircraft missiles and the S-300
anti-aircraft rocket launcher, the Soviet answer to the U.S.
Patriot.
	   Of particular interest were the Ukrainian-made precision
tactical Tochka (Point) missiles, which entered service in the
mid-1990s.
	   Many Ukrainians saw the parade as a tangible symbol of the
independence of their country of more than 50 million people.
	   But independence has brought economic and social hardship. The
country still is struggling with its deep post-Soviet economic
decline and is suffering a financial crisis.
	   Socialist leaders held a small rally Monday next to a Lenin
monument in downtown Kiev, assailing independence as a ``mockery.''
	   ``Ukraine shall be independent, Soviet and socialist,''
Socialist Party leader Vasyl Arestov told the gathering.
	   About 1,000 activists of the Ukrainian Chernobyl Union,
representing those afflicted by the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear
disaster, rallied to protest Kuchma's recent decision to slash
employers' obligatory payments to the Chernobyl Fund, which deals
with the accident's consequences, and start financing it directly
from the state budget as of 1999.
	   Government officials then agreed to negotiate planned legal
changes with the union, its chairman Yuri Andreyev told the
Interfax news agency.

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ The recent devaluation of the ruble
will not affect Ethiopia's outstanding military debt to the Russian
Federation, a senior Ethiopian official said Monday.
	   Guetachew Eschete, a senior advisor on fiscal and monetary
policy to Finance Minister Sufian Ahmed said Ethiopia and the
Russian Federation had agreed on the amoount of the military debt
to the former Soviet Union long before the Aug. 17 devaluation of
the ruble.
	   In a surprise announcement a week ago, Russian President Boris
Yeltsin said his government was letting the ruble's value drop by
one-third.
	   Ethiopia's outstanding military debt was finally fixed at 3.3
billion rubles or nearly drls 5 billion at the exchange rate to the
dollar before the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
	   The Russian Federation agreed to reduce all military debt to
developing countries by 80 percent when it joined the Paris Club of
creditors.
	   After four rounds of talks, Russia also agreed to reduce
Ethiopia's remaining outstanding military debt by nearly 93
percent, Guetachew said.
	   ``In effect, Ethiopia would be paying about 7 percent of the
outstanding 3.3 billion ruble debt _ nearly 5 billion dollars at
the former e exchange rate _ and the current ruble exchange rate
fluctuations will not affect the Ethiopian debt,'' Guetachew said.
	   A fifth round of talks between the two sides will be held in
Addis Ababa in the near future mainly to discuss the mode and
duration of the debt payment and other details, Guetachew said.

Protest swells to 2,000 against strongman Hun Sen

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The Cambodian opposition raised the
stakes Monday in protests against strongman Hun Sen as 2,000 people
mounted a sit-in outside the National Assembly, the same site as a
murderous grenade attack against a demonstration in 1997.
	   The sit-in built on the momentum of a protest by 10,000 people
Sunday demanding that Hun Sen open investigations into allegations
of fraud in National Assembly elections a month ago won by his
Cambodian People's Party.
	   Close to 1,000 people initially turned up in front of the
assembly Monday following a rally three times that size at the
city's main sports stadium, where opposition leader Sam Rainsy
denounced Hun Sen as a killer.
	   The sit-in numbers swelled to 2,000 by late afternoon, taking on
a festive atmosphere. They sat on straw mats and shielded
themselves from the sun with blue tarpaulins. Many wore yellow
ribbons _ symbol of peace and non-violence _ tied around their
foreheads.
	   The street in front of the assembly was blocked by barricades
manned by police armed with Kalashnikov rifles, but the protesters
set up their own barricades _ apparently to blunt any police charge
_ made of pedicabs and motorbikes tied together.
	   Sam Rainsy drew wild cheers each time he spoke and vowed the
protesters would remain 24 hours a day.
	   ``If they want this protest to stop they should deal with our
complaints,'' Sam Rainsy said. ``If they do not, we have no
alternative but to express our discontent through demonstrations
and sit-ins.''
	   The park was the site of a grenade attack by a protest Sam
Rainsy was leading March 30, 1997, that killed 16 people and
wounded more than 100, including him. No one was ever arrested, but
the attack has widely been blamed on Hun Sen.
	   A grenade was thrown and shots were fired Thursday at the
headquarters of the National Election Committee as Sam Rainsy tried
to lead a sleep-in at the compound. One person was killed.
	   The government has accused unspecified terrorists, but the Sam
Rainsy Party and the other chief opposition group, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC, have said responsibility lies with Hun Sen.
	   Ranariddh, who was toppled as co-prime minister in a bloody coup
by Hun Sen last year, returned Monday from a private visit in
Bangkok, Thailand.
	   The prince, whose party finished second in the vote, and Sam
Rainsy, who placed a distant third, complain that Hun Sen resorted
to massive cheating to win the polls and changed the formula under
which parliamentary seats were allotted.
	   Under the official count, Hun Sen has 64 seats in the 122-member
assembly, a slight majority but short of the two-thirds needed to
form a new government by Sept. 24, when the new assembly is
scheduled to meet for the first time.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy are boycotting the assembly and the
prince has so far refused offers to join a coalition.
	   Earlier, in a rally at the stadium, Sam Rainsy called on the
Cambodian People's Party to remove Hun Sen, whom he called
``stupid, a traitor and a murderer.''
	   Hundreds of Ranariddh's supporters were killed in the months
that followed last year's coup. Hun Sen organized new polls to win
back legitimacy and aid lost after his takeover. International
observers endorsed them as credible.
	   However, they looked mostly at voting day and the first day of
counting, which were relatively peaceful and well-run, and largely
downplayed pre-election violence against the opposition and delays
in counting the ballots, which took 10 days.

U.S. F-16 jet crashes, pilot rescued
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jet
crashed off South Korea's east coast Monday but the lone pilot
ejected by parachute and was rescued, news reports said.
	   The national Yonhap news agency said the jet from Osan air base
south of Seoul went down 1,000 meters (yards) off Anin port, 200
kilometers (125 miles) east of Seoul, shortly after 6 p.m. (0900
GMT).
	   The agency identified the pilot as David Murphy, 31. It said the
pilot was plucked by a South Korean fishing boat nearby and was
transferred to South Korean police.
	   U.S. military officials were not immediately available for
confirmation of the report.
	   About 37,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea under a
mutual defense treaty.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo's Angolan allies have driven rebel
forces from a string of Atlantic coast towns in a stunning reversal
of rebel gains, a senior government adviser said Monday. Buoyed by
recent successes, the government rejected a weekend cease-fire
proposal, insisting all Rwanda and Ugandan troops must first
withdraw from Congolese territory. South Africa and other member
state of the South African Development Community called for the
cease-fire during a hastily called weekend peace summit in
Pretoria. In Kinshasa, a second ministry-level official said
Angolan forces fighting on Kabila's behalf had taken control of the
oil port town of Muanda and the nearby town of Banana. The
insurgents, who accuse President Laurent Kabila of power-grabbing,
tribalism and mismanagement, have pushed to within 30 kilometers
(18 miles) of Kinshasa and still control the town of Mbanza-Ngungu,
the last major obstacle before the capital. (CONGO)
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan _ The United States has asked to increase
security cooperation with Sudan and assured it that last week's
attack on a Khartoum factory was not aimed at the government but at
fighting terrorism, Sudan's president says Monday. President Omar
Hassan el-Bashir made the comments in his first news conference
since Thursday's strike on a factory that U.S. officials said
manufactures chemical weapons agents but Sudan insists makes only
medicines. U.S. officials have not said anything publicly about
renewing cooperation with Sudan, which it accuses of being a
terrorist sponsoring state. President Bill Clinton tied the factory
to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi dissident blamed for the bombings of
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 257 people on Aug.
7. El-Bashir said bin Laden had no links to the factory and said
the attack was based on wrong information supplied by dissidents
opposed to his Islamic rule. (SUDAN-US)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A village outside Pristina was in
flames Monday as clashes between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian
rebels moved closer to the capital of the secessionist province in
southern Serbia. Loud booms of tank fire resounded from Agura and
smoke enveloped the village five kilometers (three miles) southwest
of Pristina. The area was blocked off by Serb police, making it
impossible to determine if rebels were fighting back or whether it
was part of the Serbs' scorch-and-burn tactics after overrunning
strongholds of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. Pristina has so
far escaped the escalated fighting that has killed hundreds of
people and displaced an estimated 230,000 from their homes since
the Serbs launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian rebels early this
year. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Her health failing, Nobel laureate Aung
San Suu Kyi heeded an appeal from her political party and returned
home Monday afternoon ending a 13-day roadside standoff with the
military government over her right to travel outside the capital.
Leaders of Suu Kyi's political party, the National League for
Democracy, urged her earlier in the day to end the protest because
of concerns over her health which had been deteriorating in recent
days. The appeal from Suu Kyi's party for her to end her protest
came as some 200 students in Yangon staged the first antigovernment
street protest in two years. The crowd fled when truckloads of
police arrived. Last week, the party had demanded that the
government release party members jailed since May as a condition
for Suu Kyi to end the standoff. As of Sunday, party officials said
none had been freed. (MYANMAR-SUU KYI)
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The Clinton administration has agreed to
allow two Libyans charged in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103
over Lockerbie to be tried by a Scottish court convened in the
Netherlands, the Los Angeles Times reported Monday. Moammar Kadafi
has refused to turn over the two men accused in the bombing that
killed all 259 passengers and crew, saying they would not receive a
fair trial in the U.S. or Britain. His regime has long sought a
compromise location and an international panel of judges. Officials
said they have held behind-the-scenes discussions with the Dutch
government and other third parties for months. The British agreed
to the new approach, the newspaper reported. Libya, however, has
not yet accepted the arrangement, the Times said. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright was to notify families of the victims of
the decision in a conference call Monday, according to families who
have been told of the plan, the Times reported. (US-PAN AM BOMBING)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets mostly fell early Monday,
pushed down by a weakened Japanese currency, political turmoil in
Russia, retreating markets in Latin America and Wall Street's
losses on Friday. But Hong Kong stocks soared as the government
intervened for the sixth straight session in an attempt to punish
speculators betting against the market. The blue-chip Hang Seng
Index jumped 317.87 points, or 4.2 percent, to 7,845.48. Most of
the gains came within 20 minutes of the market's close. In Japan,
the dollar slipped to as low as 144.30 yen as Japanese officials
said they may intervene to prop up their nation's currency. Tokyo
stocks also tumbled amid concern about delays in government efforts
to clean up the nation's bad debt-ridden banking system. The
benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped below the
important 15,000-point level for the first time in a week, falling
309.84 points, or 2.03 percent, to close at 14,988.36. (ASIAN

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin said Monday he recalled Viktor
Chernomyrdin to head the government because Russia needed an
experienced leader to restore political and economic stability.
Chernomyrdin faces an unprecedented economic crisis, a feisty
parliament and a public skeptical that any change at the top can
improve its lot. His reappointment came one week after the Russian
government effectively devalued its national currency, the ruble,
and announced it would restructure the country's short-term debts.
A day after he dismissed the government of Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko on Sunday and named Chernomyrdin acting premier, Yeltsin
suggested Chernomyrdin might be the best candidate to succeed him
when his term expires in 2000. Yeltsin asked the parliament to
approve his candidate, but parliamentary leaders announced
immediately that they would not convene a plenary session for at
least a week and asked for more time to consider the appointment.
(RUSSIA-POLITICS)
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Monetary Authority of Singapore, the
country's de facto central bank, said Monday it will continue to
manage the Singapore dollar with more flexibility as currencies
across Southeast Asia grow more volatile. In its annual report, the
MAS said its primary policy goal is to maintain price stability and
confidence in the Singapore dollar while safeguarding export
competitiveness. Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said Sunday night
that the depreciation of the Singapore dollar is not a solution in
the current currency crisis. The report said that despite a sharp
decline in the Singapore dollar against the U.S. dollar, on a
trade-weighted basis the Singapore currency has appreciated
slightly since the regional crisis erupted in July 1997. The
country's strong economic fundamentals kept the Singapore dollar
from falling as low as other regional currencies, the report said.

	   DENVER (AP) _ A 13-state strike against U S West has entered its
second week, while a strike against another U.S. telephone company
_ Southern New England Telecommunications Corp. _ entered its first
day. Talks continued into the evening Sunday without a settlement
between US West and the union representing 34,000 workers who
walked off the job Aug. 16. The country's sixth-largest telephone
company said the Communication Workers of America has refused to
discuss any of the issues that forced the walkout. The union denied
the charge. Federal mediator Jim Mahon had ordered the negotiations
to resume Sunday. Both sides met for five hours before breaking.
They gave no word on when they would meet next. Strikers walked off
their jobs over forced overtime, health benefits and a plan to tie
pay to job performance. U S West has about 25 million customers.
More than 6,000 workers walked off their jobs at SNET, which serves
nearly 3 million residents in the northeastern state of
Connecticut. (US-US WEST STRIKE)
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine expects the approval of a dlrs 2.2
billion IMF loan next week that would help the country overcome a
financial crisis, President Leonid Kuchma said Sunday. Kuchma
quoted IMF managing director Michel Camdessus as telling him in a
weekend telephone conversation that ``the IMF shall not leave
Ukraine alone with its problems at this difficult time.'' Ukraine
is experiencing a deep financial crisis caused by its massive
foreign borrowing, the lack of foreign investors and inability to
collect billions of dollars in tax debts. The crisis has been
aggravated by the ruble devaluation in Russia, which in turn pushed
the Ukrainian hryvna down against the U.S. dollar and raised fears
of further investor exodus and damage to trade with Moscow,
Ukraine's principal trade partner. Kuchma, speaking on the eve of
Ukraine's Independence Day, vowed that the former Soviet republic
would overcome the crisis, the Interfax news agency reported.

Police raid Muslim rebel hideout, rescues kidnapped doctor, aide

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Police raided a suspected Muslim
rebel hideout in a southern Philippine island and rescued a
kidnapped female doctor and an aide from four days of captivity,
police said Monday.
	   The surprised extremist Abu Sayyaf rebels abandoned their
captives after a brief gun battle Saturday on Tapiantana island, a
few kilometers (miles) south of this port city, said regional
police chief Dominador Resos.
	   Resos said the raiding policemen found Dr. Placida Ballan and an
aide in an abandoned rebel hut. The two were kidnapped Aug. 18 in
Sumipsip town in nearby Basilan island, a known rebel lair.
	   Also Monday, suspected Abu Sayyaf rebels attacked a police
detachment and a nearby house in Isabela town in Basilan, killing
two civilians and wounding two others, police said.
	   The attackers fled on board a wooden pump boat after the
policemmen in the detachment returned fire during a five-minute gun
fight, police said. There were no casualties in the government
defenders.
	   The Abu Sayyaf, which means ``Father of the Executioner,'' is
the more militant of two Muslim rebel groups fighting the
government. The government has not officially started peace talks
with the Abu Sayyaf.
	   Police are closely monitoring the group for its alleged links
with international terrorists.
	   Last week, police alerted security against possible terrorist
attacks in the southern Philippines following bomb explosions
outside U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Tanzania.
	   In 1995, the group was accused of killing 50 people and razing
the town center of Ipil in Zamboanga del Sur province.
	   The group also has been suspected of involvement in bombing
attacks. It announced its formation in 1991 by bombing the
missionary ship Doulos, killing a New Zealander and a Swede and
injuring 30 other missionaries.
	   The largest Muslim rebel group, the Moro National Liberation
Front, signed a peace pact with the government in 1996. The other
group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, is scheduled to begin
peace talks with the government this week.

Arabs give strong backing to Sudan in standoff with U.S
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) - The Arab League on Monday denounced last
week's U.S. military strikes against Sudan as an aggression against
an Arab country and gave strong political backing to the Islamic
government in Khartoum.
	   In a resolution following an emergency meeting of its council,
the 22-member league also urged Washington to refrain from any
further actions ``which may arouse public outrage'' in the Arab
world.
	   ``The council decides to condemn the American attack against the
pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum as an aggression against Sudan
and a grave violation of its sovereignty and its territorial
integrity,'' said the resolution.
	   The council, made up of Arab ambassadors to the league, adopted
the resolution after a two our debate.
	   Sudan has asked for the emergency meeting last week to seek Arab
support in its confrontation with the United States over the attack
on a Khartoum factory which Sudan insists makes medicines but
Washington claims produces ingredients for chemical weapons.
	   U.S. officials tied the factory to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi
dissident it blames for the twin bombings on U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7. Thursday attack in Khartoum was
accompanied by strikes on bases for bin Laden in Afghanistan.
	   The league's council also urged ``the United States as a
permanent member of the Security Council and as a superpower to
respect international legitimacy and refrain from these actions
which constitute an aggression against the sovereignty of states.''
	   It also pledged ``material an moral backing to eradicate the
effects of the American strikes and support Sudan in international
organizations. Sudan also has urged a meeting of the U.N. Security
Council to discuss the air strikes.
	   On Saturday, Sudan's President Omar el-Bashir played down the
importance of the league's meeting, saying Sudan did not expect
much from the discussions.
	   But the league's resolution gives Sudan significant symbolic
backing, especially given that most Arab states have failed to
publicly condemn the U.S. attack. The resolution also endorses
Sudan's claim that the site was a pharmaceutical plant.
	   After Thursday's air strike Sudan received strong backing from
some of Washington's staunchest Middle East opponents, including
Iraq, Libya and Iran _ which roundly condemned the U.S. military
strikes.
	   Most other Arab states remained silent, though Egypt and Kuwait
indirectly criticized the attack by saying the fight against
international terrorism should be conducted through the United
Nations.
	   The leading Arabic daily Al-Hayat, based in London, said in an
editorial Monday that ``although Arabs are not reluctant to condemn
terrorism, most Arab governments find it embarrassing to support an
American policy which lacks wisdom and insight.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Several villages outside Pristina
were in flames Monday as clashes between Serb forces and ethnic
Albanian rebels moved the closest yet to the capital of the
secessionist province in southern Serbia.
	   Loud booms of tank fire resounded from Recak and other villages
and smoke enveloped an area starting just 5 kilometers (3 miles)
off the southwestern edge of Pristina. Houses were burning,
apparently targeted in a Serb attack that could be heard from the
capital starting late Sunday.
	   The area was partly blocked off by Serb police, making it
difficult to determine whether there was strong rebel resistance or
if it was part of the Serbs' scorched-earth tactics after
overrunning KLA strongholds.
	   Fleeing the area, local residents said Serb tanks positioned in
the hills near Stimjle and elsewhere were shelling an extended area
along the main road southwest of Pristina.
	   Blerim Sadiku, driving a horse-drawn carriage with his family
members, mattresses and other belongings piled in the back, said,
``It was too dangerous to stay.''
	   Asked where they were headed, he replied: ``We have no idea. We
have to ask someone for shelter.''
	   The assault appeared to be part of a new offensive launched
southwest of the capital on Sunday by Serb forces, hoping to crush
a rebellion by militant ethnic Albanians.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the ethnic Albanian
leadership, said two ethnic Albanians were killed in Sunday's
fighting near the town of Suva Reka. It also said Serb police
overnight had brought 10 bodies into a morgue in Djakovica _
victims of fighting near the Albanian border.
	   The Serb-run Media Center said one Serb policeman was killed
Sunday in the fighting southwest of the capital.
	   Pristina has so far escaped the escalated fighting that has
killed hundreds of people and displaced an estimated 230,000 from
their homes since the Serbs launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian
rebels early this year.
	   Ethnic Albanians comprise about 90 percent of the population of
Kosovo, where most want independence from Serbia, the dominant
republic in the Yugoslav Federation.
	   Serb forces have sent Kosovo Liberation Army fighters fleeing in
an all-out push since mid-July, forcing the heavily outmanned KLA
to regroup and change tactics.
	   In an interview published Monday, a rebel representative
acknowledged that the KLA will now rely on guerrilla warfare to win
the province's independence from Serbia, adding ``We will strike in
every corner of Kosovo.''
	   Adem Demaci told the Vienna news magazine Profil that the rebels
had made the ``fatal mistake'' of trying to ``defend a territory
they cannot defend.'' Instead, they want to launch surprise
strikes.
	   He said he is ready to start negotiations with Serb authorities
``when certain conditions are fulfilled'' _ primarily the end of
Serb attacks.
	   But the Serbian government says it will never negotiate with the
Kosovo ``terrorists.''
	   The latest Serb actions are thought to be in retaliation for
reported KLA attacks Saturday and early Sunday on Serb police and a
Yugoslav army unit in the same region.
	   Meanwhile, in Skopje, Macedonia, the premiers of Macedonia and
Albania, both concerned with a spillover of violence from nearby
Kosovo, pledged to preserve peace in their countries.
	   ``The crisis in Kosovo has caused concern, and Macedonia and
Albanian have most reasons to worry,'' Macedonian Prime Minister
Branko Crvenkovski said Sunday, wrapping up a two-day visit by his
Albanian counterpart, Fatos Nano.

Kiriyenko: Debt will be converted under equal conditions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's domestic government debt will be
converted into new paper under equal conditions for foreign and
local investors, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted outgoing Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko as saying Monday.
	   Otherwise, ``we will lose investors,'' Kiriyenko was quoted as
saying.
	   The acting government, headed by former Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, is due to announce the restructuring plan later
Monday.
	   Kiriyenko's government announced the restructuring of the debt a
week ago, after the government ran out of cash to prop up the ruble
amid a burgeoning financial crisis.
	   The debt swap was to have been announced Wednesday, but foreign
investors said it was delayed after they cried foul over the terms
for foreign investors in the original plan.
	   The outstanding bond issues to be swapped for longer-term paper
total dlrs 40 billion in value. More than dlrs 11 billion of the
treasuries are held by foreign investors.
	   It isn't clear whether the government will be offering investors
face value or market value for their treasuries. However, investors
are expecting the government to offer them three swap plans.
	   One plan would offer five-year, dollar denominated paper
offering a coupon of 6 percent, while another plan would offer
three-year, ruble-denominated paper with a much higher coupon in
excess of 50 percent. A last option would allow investors to keep
their existing treasuries, and, after two years, cash them in for
paper exchangeable into dollars.

Opposition accuses Kohl of laxness toward Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl bears part of the
blame for Russia's financial crisis because he put his friendship
with Boris Yeltsin above the need for tough reforms, the opposition
Social Democrats charged Monday.
	   With German elections due in less than five weeks, party
chairman Oskar Lafontaine said a Social Democratic government would
keep tighter tabs on what happens to financial aid to Russia than
Kohl has.
	   Kohl, lagging in polls ahead of the Sept. 27 vote, has recently
touted his experience as a statesman and his influence with Moscow
as a reason Germans should elect him at a time of financial crisis
in Russia and Asia.
	   But Lafontaine implicated him in Russia's problems, alluding to
Kohl's friendly ties with the Russian president.
	   ``Betting on the Russian president cannot remain Germany's only
response,'' he told a news conference. ``It's not us who have been
sitting in the sauna with Yeltsin.''
	   Kohl has ruled out fresh financial aid for now and has urged
Yeltsin to push ahead with economic reforms.
	   He used the crisis manager theme when he kicked off the final
phase of his campaign at a rally of his conservative Christian
Democrats on Sunday.
	   Kohl also accused the Social Democrats of duping voters by
talking up chances of a joint government after the election as a
way too appeal to centrist voters.
	   ``Is that all he could cook up?'' Lafontaine retorted. ``I saw a
very tired and labored performance.''
	   Lafontaine said the Social Democrats would prefer to govern with
the sometimes radical Greens, but he did not rule out a ``grand
coalition'' of the two big parties.
	   Lafontaine, tapped to be finance minister if the Social
Democrats win, said the Russian crisis underlines the need for
measures to stabilize exchange rates.
	   He said Yeltsin's ``not very consistent'' running of Russia
hurts the confidence of financial markets, and he charged that
German financial aid to Russia has not been well spent in the past.
	   ``Kohl's government seems to have lacked strictness on this
point purely out of friendship,'' he said.

New Zealand considers buying ``near-new'' U.S. fighters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Defense Minister Max Bradford
said Monday that New Zealand may buy a squadron of U.S. F/16 attack
fighters held back from Pakistan out of concerns over its nuclear
testing program.
	   Bradford said the planes could meet air combat requirements to
replace New Zealand's 28-year-old Skyhawk fighter-bombers, but that
a decision had not yet been made.
	   ``If there was to be any interest at all by the New Zealand
government ... it would have to be a particularly attractive
financial proposal that meets our needs,'' Bradford said.
	   The squadron of barely-used Lockheed Martin F/16s is being
looked at by New Zealand air force and defense personnel in the
United State.
	   The Pakistani Air Force ordered the 28 planes in 1990 and paid
U.S. dlrs 658 million (New Zealand dollars 1.3 billion) for them.
But delivery was blocked by the U.S. Congress out of concerns over
Pakistan's nuclear testing program.
	   Nine of the planes were then ordered by Indonesia for about U.S.
dlrs 200 million (New Zealand dollars 400 million) but the
Southeast Asian country canceled the deal last year after the
United States criticized its human rights record.
	   Wellington's Evening Post newspaper reported over the weekend
that in May the planes were offered as last-minute bait to Pakistan
to persuade it to refrain from testing nuclear weapons in response
to India's nuclear tests.
	   The efforts reportedly failed when Pakistan conducted a series
of underground nuclear explosions.
	   New Zealand's Deputy Secretary of Defense Robin Johansen is
reportedly in the United States looking at the planes.
	   The Skyhawks, due to be dropped by 2007, are limited to daytime
operations.

Cost-sharing agreement to be signed for nuclear reactors in North
</HEADLINE>
Korea

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ An international consortium set up to
build two nuclear reactors in North Korea under a historic 1994
accord will sign a cost-sharing agreement for the project this
weekend, Seoul officials said Monday.
	   The agreement, to be signed in Seoul on Saturday, will set
detailed guidelines for the cost burdens of each of the four key
members of the consortium, called the Korean Peninsula Energy
Development Organization, the Unification Ministry officials said.
	   South Korea has already promised to take up 70 percent, or dlrs
3.22 billion, of the projected dlrs 4.6 billion costs for the two
reactors with a projected capacity of 1,000 megawatts each.
	   Japan has committed to dlrs 1 billion. The balance has yet to be
filled by the United States and other countries. The United States
also is committed to provide North Korea with 500,000 tons of
substitute fuel oil a year until the first reactor is build by
2003.
	   The Western-developed light-water reactors are a reward for
North Korea's promise to freeze and eventually dismantle its
graphite-moderated reactors under a 1994 accord with the United
States.
	   The light-water reactors produce far less weapons-grade
plutonium than the North's Soviet-developed reactors.
	   The new reactors will be built in Sinpo, a remote seaside
village in a northeastern part of North Korea. Ground-leveling for
the project has been completed, with main construction work
scheduled to begin in October.

Thousands of Romanian miners protest layoffs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Almost 28,000 miners in Romania went
on a one-day strike Monday to protest layoffs and unpaid salaries
and what they called the government's failure to reform the mining
system, national radio reported.
	   ``We want to keep our jobs,'' said Nicolae Jegau, a leader of
coal miners in Jiu Valley in southwestern Romania, which has 45,000
miners. Speaking on national radio, he appealed to the government
to intervene in the crisis.
	   Miners are demanding immediate negotiations with the government.
They said they will go on indefinite strike if their demands are
not met.
	   In June, the government ordered 108 mines to be closed down as
part of its economic reforms. The closures would jeopardize 110,000
miners' jobs.
	   The government did not immediately comment about the strike.
	   Coal, copper, lignite and metal miners took to the streets in
the localities of Motru, Rovinari, Hunedoara, and Campulung Muscel
to underscore their claims, radio reported.
	   Tens of state companies have not paid their debts to the
national electricity company, Renel, which has said it will cut off
their energy. As a result, Renel has not had the money to pay the
mines. Mines have not paid salaries on time.
	   Miners traditionally were among the best-paid workers in
Romania. Since communism fell in 1989, miners twice have rampaged
through Bucharest, violently attacking residents and causing the
downfall of one premier, Petre Roman.
	   Last summer, the center-right reform government began a massive
program of layoffs. Almost 100,000 miners have been laid off since
September 1997 in a scheme in which the government gives each miner
up to 20 months' salaries.
	   Initially, miners were happy to accept payoffs, but now seem to
be realizing their lives have not improved. Miners' leaders said
that most of the miners have spent this money and only 10,000 have
found new jobs.

Protest swells to 2,000 against strongman Hun Sen

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with many protesters leaving due to rain, 8th graf.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The Cambodian opposition raised the
stakes Monday in protests against strongman Hun Sen as 2,000 people
mounted a sit-in outside the National Assembly, the same site as a
murderous grenade attack against a demonstration in 1997.
	   The sit-in built on the momentum of a protest by 10,000 people
Sunday demanding that Hun Sen open investigations into allegations
of fraud in National Assembly elections a month ago won by his
Cambodian People's Party.
	   Close to 1,000 people initially turned up in front of the
assembly Monday following a rally three times that size at the
city's main sports stadium, where opposition leader Sam Rainsy
denounced Hun Sen as a killer.
	   The sit-in numbers swelled to 2,000 by late afternoon, taking on
a festive atmosphere. They sat on straw mats and shielded
themselves from the sun with blue tarpaulins. Many wore yellow
ribbons _ symbol of peace and non-violence _ tied around their
foreheads.
	   The street in front of the assembly was blocked by barricades
manned by police armed with Kalashnikov rifles, but the protesters
set up their own barricades _ apparently to blunt any police charge
_ made of pedicabs and motorbikes tied together.
	   Sam Rainsy drew wild cheers each time he spoke and vowed the
protesters would remain 24 hours a day.
	   ``If they want this protest to stop they should deal with our
complaints,'' Sam Rainsy said. ``If they do not, we have no
alternative but to express our discontent through demonstrations
and sit-ins.''
	   However, early evening rains persuaded most people to leave the
park. Sam Rainsy said earlier he planned to sleep with the crowd,
but it was unclear if the rain would make him change his mind.
	   The park was the site of a grenade attack by a protest Sam
Rainsy was leading March 30, 1997, that killed 16 people and
wounded more than 100, including him. No one was ever arrested, but
the attack has widely been blamed on Hun Sen.
	   A grenade was thrown and shots were fired Thursday at the
headquarters of the National Election Committee as Sam Rainsy tried
to lead a sleep-in at the compound. One person was killed.
	   The government has accused unspecified terrorists, but the Sam
Rainsy Party and the other chief opposition group, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC, have said responsibility lies with Hun Sen.
	   Ranariddh, who was toppled as co-prime minister in a bloody coup
by Hun Sen last year, returned Monday from a private visit in
Bangkok, Thailand.
	   The prince, whose party finished second, and Sam Rainsy, who
placed a distant third, complain that Hun Sen resorted to massive
cheating to win the polls and changed the formula under which
parliamentary seats were allotted.
	   Under the official count, Hun Sen has 64 seats in the 122-member
assembly, a slight majority but short of the two-thirds needed to
form a new government by Sept. 24, when the new assembly is
scheduled to meet for the first time.
	   Sam Rainsy called on the Cambodian People's Party to remove Hun
Sen, whom he called ``stupid, a traitor and a murderer.''
	   Hundreds of Ranariddh's supporters were killed in the months
that followed last year's coup. Hun Sen organized new polls to win
back legitimacy and aid lost after his takeover. International
observers endorsed them as credible.
	   However, they looked mostly at voting day and the first day of
counting, which were relatively peaceful and well-run, and largely
downplayed pre-election violence against the opposition and delays
in counting the ballots, which took 10 days.

Security forces in state of ``extreme vigilance''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece Monday said its security forces
were in a state of ``extreme vigilance'' to thwart any retaliatory
terrorist attacks against American interests here.
	   ``They are measures of extreme vigilance,'' said government
spokesman Dimitris Reppas.
	   Although Reppas would not say what steps had been taken to
protect possible targets, he said they were implemented following
last week's strike by the United States against a suspected
militant training camp in Afghanistan and a chemical plant in
Sudan.
	   Reppas did confirm a report published in the Athens daily Ta Nea
about bolstered security at the United States embassy, and American
diplomatic and business interests.
	   Ta Nea also reported increased security at the country's
airports and other points of entry, with police focusing on
travelers of north African and Arab origin.
	   Greece also has its own home-grown terror groups to worry about.
	   The deadliest, November 17, earlier this year claimed
responsibility for a spate of attacks against American targets,
including an anti-tank rocket blast at a Citibank branch.
	   It has killed 21 people since it first emerged in 1975 with the
murder of Richard Welch, the CIA station chief in Athens. Since
then, it has killed other Americans, Greeks and Turks.

Hungary's forint falls to record lows on news from Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The Hungarian forint fell briefly to
record lows against the dollar and the Deutsche mark Monday, as
nervousness about Russia's government shakeup swept through
markets.
	   The National Bank of Hungary said it might intervene on the
foreign exchange market to stabilize the currency. It said that the
forint's weakening was too sharp and too fast, and that the
currency's movements didn't reflect Hungary's underlying economic
stability.
	   At one point in early trading Monday the forint was bid at 1.8
percent on the weak side of its trading band, a record low. The
currency was sharply weaker from about 0.7 percent on the weak side
of the band at Wednesday's close, prior to a two-day national
holiday Thursday and Friday.
	   But the forint staged a gradual rebound by midday, rising to
around 1.15 percent on the soft side of the trading band.

Chinese general pledges to support Pakistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ One of China's most senior generals pledged
unwavering support for Pakistan Monday and expressed concern over
tensions with India, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   Gen. Fu Quanyou, chief of the general staff of the People's
Liberation Army, told his Pakistani counterpart, Gen. Jehangir
Karamat, that Beijing was worried about the situation in South
Asia, including the disputed territory of Kashmir, Xinhua said.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over the mountainous
territory, which abuts China-held Tibet. Regular exchanges of
gunfire across the Kashmir border have intensified in the past
month.
	   The increased tensions follow India and Pakistan's explosions of
nuclear bombs in May, an escalation of their long, but mostly
covert nuclear arms race.
	   Xinhua did not mention whether Fu and Karamat discussed the
nuclear tensions. China has been a loyal supporter of Pakistan and
has transferred nuclear and missile technology to Islamabad.
	   Fu noted that China will continue to support Pakistan ``however
the international situation changes,'' Xinhua reported.

Hydrofoil suspended after fatal accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A hydrofoil operating from Ho Chi Minh
City has been suspended after an accident in which one person was
killed and three injured, a Waterways Transport Department said
Monday.
	   The 116-passenger hydrofoil, which travels to My Tho and Can Tho
in the Mekong Delta, collided last Thursday with a boat carrying 32
people to a wedding.
	   Proshipser, a local company that began the hydrofoil service in
April, was asked to suspend its operation by last Saturday to
improve safety and submit a route plan.
	   A second Proshipser hydrofoil route from Ho Chi Minh City to
Vung Tau was not affected by the suspension.

Angola's former rebels cut ties with US, Russia, Portugal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The former rebel movement UNITA said
Monday it was ceasing all contact with U.S., Russian and Portuguese
observers who are monitoring Angola's peace process for the United
Nations.
	   UNITA's policy committee accused the three nations of bias
toward the Angolan government, UNITA's foe during the country's
civil war, in implementing a 1994 peace accord.
	   The countries were acting in their own economic interests in
this oil- and diamond-rich country, UNITA said in a written
statement issued from its central highland stronghold Bailundo and
faxed to The Associated Press.
	   UNITA said the observer nations had ``disqualified themselves
totally (from the peace process) by not abiding by the criteria of
neutrality ... and impartiality.''
	   Officials of the three observer nations had no immediate
comment.
	   The U.N. Security Council has accused UNITA of dragging its feet
in implementing the peace deal and has imposed sanctions against
the group.
	   UNITA said in the statement that it remained committed to the
peace pact which has been stymied by lingering hostility between
the former foes. Its implementation is more than a year behind
schedule.
	   The observer countries, chosen because of their historic
involvement with the Southwest African nation, participate in
meetings of the Luanda-based Joint Commission.
	   The Joint Commission monitors implementation of the
U.N.-brokered 1994 peace accord that ended two decades of fighting
between the government and UNITA. It also includes representatives
of the government, UNITA and the United Nations.
	   UNITA Secretary-General Paulo Lukamba Gato said by telephone
from Bailundo that his group would still attend Joint Commission
meetings but would not talk to officials from the observer
countries.
	   The UNITA statement accused Portugal of siding with the
government against UNITA.
	   Portugal was the colonial ruler before granting independence in
1975. During the Cold War, the U.S. supported UNITA and the Soviet
Union backed the then-Marxist government, providing funds and
military equipment.
	   The U.S. last month imposed new economic sanctions on UNITA,
including a freeze on their bank accounts, to force the former
rebels to fulfill all terms of the peace accord. UNITA stills
controls four central highland towns which it was supposed to hand
back to the government.
	   UNITA said U.S. policy was ``simply ridiculous and unwise.''
	   The movement said Russia had flouted the so-called ``triple-zero
option'' of the peace accord under which the three observer nations
pledged not to sell arms to either side. The Angolan government
recently signed a military cooperation deal, including weapons
maintenance, with Russia.

Kremlin spokesman: Moscow summit `useful' for both Yeltsin,
</HEADLINE>
Clinton &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government shakeup and U.S. President
Bill Clinton's domestic problems make the upcoming Russian-U.S.
presidential summit even more important than usual for both
leaders, the Kremlin spokesman said Monday.
	   ``Taking into account the circumstances in Russia and in the
United States for the U.S. president, such a visit will be
extremely useful for both presidents and for Russian-U.S. relations
as a whole,'' President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman Sergei
Yastrzhembsky said at a news conference.
	   Yastrzhembsky rejected allegations that the summit, scheduled
for Sept. 1-3, would be a waste of time while the Russian
government is in limbo following Yeltsin's decision Sunday to oust
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko's Cabinet.
	   ``Such contacts, meetings and exchanges of opinion are
particularly important and valuable in times of crisis and
upheaval,'' he said.
	   Clinton is scheduled to arrive in Moscow early on Sept. 1,
Yastrzhembsky said. Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, whom
Yeltsin nominated Sunday, will meet him at the airport.
	   Later that day, Yeltsin and Clinton will hold talks attended by
officials on both sides. In the evening, Yeltsin will honor his
guest with a state dinner in the Kremlin.
	   More talks will take place the next day, Yastrzhembsky said.
	   The summit will provide an ``excellent opportunity for
discussing the whole agenda of Russian-U.S. relations after a long
break, the whole spectrum of issues the two nations face on the
world arena,'' Yastrzhembsky said.

Children's center in Paris to be named after Diana

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A children's center in Paris will be named after
Princess Diana, and the city eventually plans to name a street
after her, the mayor of Paris said Monday.
	   Mayor Jean Tiberi also said in an interview on RTL radio that
any moves to name a street or square after the princess required
the agreement of the British Embassy.
	   The first anniversary of the car crash in a Paris traffic tunnel
that killed Diana is just a week away. A poll earlier this month
showed that 70 percent of French people want a street or square to
be named after her.

Dolphins 21, 49ers 20
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DENNIS GEORGATOS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Jimmy Johnson is concerned about the Miami
Dolphins' depth at quarterback. His team's suspect running game is
starting to come around, though.
	   Rookie John Avery's two-touchdown performance in his Dolphins
debut, a 21-20 victory over San Francisco on Sunday, was an
encouraging sign for Johnson.
	   ``I was pleased to get Avery into the ball game,'' Johnson said.
``He's just like what I thought he was going to be. It's what we
saw in college. If he has a crack, he's liable to go the
distance.''
	   Avery, the Dolphins' first-round pick out of Mississippi, missed
the first two exhibitions with a hamstring strain, but showed no
ill effects from the injury in an impressive debut. He rushed for
99 yards on 13 carries, including touchdown runs of 2 and 71 yards
in the second half.
	   Miami remained unbeaten in three preseason games. A botched
extra-point by San Francisco (2-2) was the difference.
	   In exhibition games Saturday, it was San Diego 33, Indianapolis
3; Cincinnati 33, Detroit 19; New England 20, Washington 17;
Minnesota 25, Carolina 22, in overtime; Pittsburgh 28, Atlanta 22;
St. Louis 22, Dallas 14; Kansas City 22, Jacksonville 21; Tennessee
26, New Orleans 24; and Seattle 31, Arizona 24.
	   Three games were on tap Monday _ Philadelphia at Baltimore,
Green Bay at Denver and Tampa Bay at Oakland.
	   Dan Marino, who was 12-of-23 for 158 yards and a touchdown in a
little over a half of play, said Avery should give the Dolphins a
boost.
	   ``That shows his ability in the open field,'' Marino said. ``I
think that's what coach Johnson is looking for.''
	   Johnson also is looking for more out of backup quarterbacks
Craig Erickson and Damon Huard. The two combined to complete just
one pass in four throws.
	   ``I'm still a little troubled with our backup quarterback
situation,'' Johnson said. ``I wasn't too happy with what I saw out
there.''
	   Meanwhile, 49ers coach Steve Mariucci was pretty happy with what
he saw from Steve Young and Terrell Owens. They teamed for three
touchdowns.
	   ``It was a good test for us and I was pleased to get out front
20-7,'' Mariucci said. ``I thought Steve Young was sharp and
Terrell Owens certainly had a good day.''
	   He couldn't say the same for his backup quarterbacks. Jim
Druckenmiller threw an interception preceding Avery's first
touchdown run and Ty Detmer also had trouble moving the team.
	   No decision has been made on which one will be the top backup to
Young, who completed 13 of 21 for 232 yards, including scoring
passes of 72, 1 and 26 yards to Owens.
	   Young's last throw, his third scoring pass to Owens early in the
third quarter, left him hurting when his hand struck defensive end
Trace Armstrong's helmet on the follow-through.
	   He trotted off the field grimacing and holding his left wrist
and watched the rest of the game from the sidelines with his hand
wrapped in a bandage. But Young said afterward the injury wasn't
serious.
	   Both the Dolphins and 49ers were hit with other injuries.
	   Charles Jordan, who caught a 37-yard touchdown pass from Marino
early in the second quarter, had to leave later in the period with
a strained left groin. Fellow wide receiver O.J. McDuffie sustained
a bruised left knee and left in the third quarter.
	   Miami already has lost wideout Yatil Green, who will miss his
second straight season after reinjuring his knee during practice
last week.
	   Dolphins safety Calvin Jackson was forced from the game in the
first half with a left groin strain and San Francisco backup center
Harris Barton was knocked out with 7:45 left with a right ankle
sprain. Barton may be the most seriously injured and was listed as
questionable for Friday's game at Seattle.
	   On Saturday, Ryan Leaf was 15 for 24 for 172 yards, set up one
touchdown and ran for a score as San Diego beat Indianapolis for
its third straight preseason victory.
	   Neil O'Donnell made his claim on Cincinnati's starting
quarterback job, completing 15 of 18 passes for 147 yards,
including a 40-yard touchdown pass to Darnay Scott, as the Bengals
beat the Lions.
	   Phil Dawson, claimed off waivers Friday, kicked a 41-yard field
goal with 2:30 left to lead New England past Washington. Gary
Anderson made a 26-yard field goal with 7:59 left in overtime as
Minnesota beat Carolina to improve to 3-0 in the preseason.
	   Richard Huntley rushed for 120 yards and two touchdowns on six
carries in the Steelers' victory over the Falcons. St. Louis'
backups outscored Dallas' subs 13-0 in the second half, with the
winning touchdown a 1-yard run by Greg Hill with 5:42 left in the
third quarter.
	   Backup quarterback Rich Gannon threw for one second-half
touchdown and ran for one as Kansas City beat Jacksonville. Steve
McNair was 11-of-24 for 200 yards and had two runs for 24 yards as
Tennessee beat New Orleans.
	   Warren Moon, seeing game action for the first time since he
ended his holdout Aug. 12, beat Arizona's secondary for two long
touchdown passes as Seattle edged Arizona.

Malaysian PM lashes out at foreign press
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on
Monday said that Malaysia won't seek a bailout from the
International Monetary Fund and accused the foreign press of
exaggerating his country's financial problems.
	   Blasting what he views as the negative influence of the Western
media, Mahathir said: ``Our economy is not as bad as the foreigners
say. But our opinion will change if we go to the IMF. But we are
not going to the IMF.''
	   He was speaking at the launch of a new, four-wheel drive car
made by Perodua, Malaysia's second national automobile producer.
	   Mahathir asked his audience how, if the economy was so bad,
Malaysia could afford to launch a new vehicle.
	   The brusque prime minister compared foreign reporters to soccer
fans who think they can play the game better than the players.
	   Malaysia's economy this year has been rocked by the aftershocks
of the Asian financial crisis. Gross Domestic Product shrank 1.8
percent in the first quarter of the year compared with 6.9 percent
the previous quarter.
	   The second quarter figures are due out this week, and economists
fear a year-on-year contraction of up to 6 percent, sending
Malaysia into official recession.
	   However, the government, after increasing its budget by 20
percent and loosening monetary policy, hopes the third and fourth
quarters will show a slower rate of decline.

Arabs give strong backing to Sudan in standoff with United States
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Arab League on Monday denounced last
week's U.S. military strikes against Sudan as an aggression against
an Arab country and gave strong political backing to the Islamic
government in Khartoum.
	   In a resolution following an emergency meeting of its council,
the 22-member league also urged Washington to refrain from any
further actions ``which may arouse public outrage'' in the Arab
world.
	   ``The council decides to condemn the American attack against the
pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum as an aggression against Sudan
and a grave violation of its sovereignty and its territorial
integrity,'' said the resolution.
	   The council, made up of Arab ambassadors to the league, adopted
the resolution after a two-hour debate.
	   Sudan has asked for the emergency meeting last week to seek Arab
support in its confrontation with the United States over the attack
on a Khartoum factory which Sudan insists makes medicines but
Washington claims produces ingredients for chemical weapons.
	   U.S. officials tied the factory to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi
dissident it blames for the Aug. 7 twin bombings on U.S. embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania. The U.S. attack in Khartoum was accompanied
Thursday by strikes on bin Laden's bases in Afghanistan.
	   The league's council also urged ``the United States as a
permanent member of the Security Council and as a superpower to
respect international legitimacy and refrain from these actions
which constitute an aggression against the sovereignty of states.''
	   It also pledged ``material and moral backing to eradicate the
effects of the American strikes and support Sudan in international
organizations. Sudan also has urged a meeting of the U.N. Security
Council to discuss the air strikes.
	   On Saturday, Sudan's President Omar el-Bashir played down the
importance of the league's meeting, saying Sudan did not expect
much from the discussions.
	   But the league's resolution gives Sudan significant symbolic
backing, especially given that most Arab states have failed to
publicly condemn the U.S. attack. The resolution also endorses
Sudan's claim that the site was a pharmaceutical plant.
	   After Thursday's air strike Sudan received strong backing from
some of Washington's staunchest Middle East opponents, including
Iraq, Libya and Iran _ which roundly condemned the U.S. military
strikes.
	   Most other Arab states remained silent, though Egypt and Kuwait
indirectly criticized the attack by saying the fight against
international terrorism should be conducted through the United
Nations.
	   The leading Arabic daily Al-Hayat, based in London, said in an
editorial Monday that ``although Arabs are not reluctant to condemn
terrorism, most Arab governments find it embarrassing to support an
American policy which lacks wisdom and insight.''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to clarify 39 people on board, no foreigners

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ A Myanmar Airways domestic flight
carrying 39 people disappeared Monday while flying to the northern
city of Tachilek, government officials said.
	   There were no foreigners on board, government officials said.
Two of the passengers were infant children. Search and rescue
efforts were under way.
	   Tachilek, 560 kilometers (350 miles) north of Yangon, straddles
the border with Thailand in the mountainous region of Shan State in
the opium-rich Golden Triangle, where the borders of Myanmar,
Thailand and Laos converge.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, is currently in its monsoon
season. It is unknown if weather played a part in the plane's
disappearance.

Spaniard does high-tech research into the secret life of hams
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ In an odd marriage of science and
gastronomy, Spanish researchers are using a CAT scan to see what
goes on inside ham.
	   Not just any ham, but some of Spain's finest _ 'jamon iberico',
a pricy cut that is roughly like Italian prosciutto, only darker
and chewier.
	   The project is the brainchild of physicist Juan Atanasio
Carrasco, who hails from the north-central town of Guijuelo, known
for its Iberian ham, the newspaper El Pais reports.
	   The delicacy is produced by covering a raw pork leg with rock
salt for several days, washing it off then hanging it from a
warehouse roof for as long as two and a half years.
	   Carrasco has been probing the technical side of ham-curing _ how
the salt spreads through the ham, optimum temperature and humidity
and so forth. He's even come up with a computer model.
	   His goal is to help producers improve quality and minimize the
number of hams that spoil before reaching store shelves.
	   With funding from ham producers, Carrasco and his team have
attached sensors to four hams in Guijuelo to monitor them as they
cure.
	   And under an agreement with the Spanish health ministry,
periodically he takes the hams to the October 12th Hospital in
Madrid to have a peek at their innards with a CAT scan.
	   This diagnostic tool -- which renders cross-sectional images
using computerized axial tomography -- allows doctors to examine
tissues without cutting into them. So it's perfect for ham
research.
	   ``It is a non-intrusive technique,'' radiologist Alberto Munoz,
who is working with Carrasco, told the newspaper.
	   Munoz said he's used to CAT-scanning dead things, like skulls
dug up by archeologists.

Sudan factory &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RETRANSMITTING to delete periods from slugline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Despite strong British support, the United States
has not shared with Britain evidence that the Sudan factory it
bombed was producing weapons of mass destruction, the chairman of
Parliament's committee on foreign affairs said Monday.
	   ``That evidence, as I understand it, has not been produced by
the U.S. to its allies,'' Donald Anderson, a governing Labor Party
legislator who is chairman of the House of Commons all-party
committee, said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview.
	   Anderson added that Britain and the United States should stand
together against world terrorism.
	   ``But when we go out on a limb, as we have done, the U.S. owes
us the position that they should tell us the evidence they have,''
he said.
	   Britain was one of the few countries informed in advance by
Washington about last week's attacks on the Sudan factory and on a
suspected terrorist training facility in Afghanistan in retaliation
for Aug. 7 bombings of the American embassies in two east African
capitals, Nairobi and Tanzania.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair immediately expressed full support.
	   On Sunday, Defense Secretary George Robertson said Britain had
``independent evidence'' that the Osama bin Laden, the Saudi
millionaire blamed by Washington for the embassy bombings, is
seeking to acquire weapons of mass destruction and shares the U.S.
view that further attacks are planned.
	   Robertson gave no further details.
	   Committee chairman Anderson said there was clear evidence that
the Afghan targets were used for terror purposes.

Talks begin to keep CNN on Amsterdam cable
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Crisis talks began Monday aimed at
keeping CNN's round-the-clock news coverage on the Dutch capital's
cable television service.
	   The discussions between representatives of Amsterdam cable
provider A2000, the city council and the influential consumer
watchdog group Consumentenbond, were intended to head off a legal
battle to keep CNN International on the air.
	   Turner Broadcasting System announced last week it was refusing
to pay a 725,000 (dlrs 362,500) fee to A2000. The cable company
responded by ordering the plug pulled on the 24-hour news service
as of Tuesday.
	   The decision, which would make Amsterdam the only major European
city without CNN, prompted thousands of people to complain to
Consumentenbond.
	   Representatives for CNN were not involved in the talks, said
Matthijs Spits, spokesman for Turner Broadcasting Systems Europe.
	   Former Amsterdam city councilor Walter Etty, who takes over the
chairmanship of Consumentenbond in October, said television viewers
should not become victims of the fee dispute between A2000 and CNN.
The consumers' group set up a telephone line Monday to log
complaints from irate viewers.
	   If a solution was not found to the conflict at Monday's talks,
the Consumentenbond was planning to take out an injunction
preventing A2000 from dumping CNN.
	   With its decision to fade to black in Amsterdam, CNN follows
music channel MTV Europe, Eurosport and The Discovery Channel, all
of which have gone off the air for the same reasons.
	   Although CNN still would be available through a satellite dish
and decoder, relatively few Dutch households have them.

Assailants steal weapons, files from Dagestan police

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yeltsin ordering Stepashin to take situation
under personal control, criminal case launched against leaders of
separatist villages. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) _ Masked assailants forced their way
into the police headquarters of the violence-wracked republic of
Dagestan early Monday and stole weapons and files.
	   The armed attackers tied up police officers at the republic's
Interior Ministry building in the capital Makhachkala before
collecting their haul and making their escape, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported. A regional police alert has not turned up any
suspects.
	   Meanwhile, Russian President Boris Yeltsin met with acting
Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin on Monday and told him to ``take
the situation in Dagestan under personal control,'' Yeltsin
spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.
	   Stepashin, who has been supervising the investigation into last
week's killing of Dagestan's highest-ranking Muslim spiritual
leader, told Yeltsin that investigators have found several suspects
in the killing of Mufti Said-Mohammad Abubakarov.
	   Abubakarov was killed in a car-bombing Friday, along with his
brother and driver. Authorities believe that the Wahhabis, a
fundamentalist Islamic sect, could have been involved in the
attack.
	   In another development, a regional prosecutor has opened a
criminal case against Islamic fundamentalists in Dagestan who have
declared their three villages independent from the republic's
government, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   The fundamentalists in the villages of Karamakhi, Chabanmakhi
and Kadar are accused of religious extremism for proclaiming
themselves a ``separate Islamic territory'' and planning to set up
their own government.
	   Bombings, kidnappings and other violent crimes have kept
Dagestan on edge for months. Various ethnic and religious groups
have been vying for power in the republic, which borders on
secessionist Chechnya.

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The front-running design for Germany's planned
national Holocaust Memorial could cost almost twice as much to
build as has been budgeted, Berlin's construction chief said
Monday.
	   A day before the city government was to debate the three
finalists, building minister Juergen Klemann said even the recently
scaled-down design by U.S. architect Peter Eisenmann could cost 29
million marks (dlrs 16 million) to realize.
	   Culture ministry spokesman Axel Wallrabenstein insisted,
however, that engineers have examined the three models and
determined that all could be built with the 15 million marks (dlrs
8.3 million) budgeted for the project.
	   Half of the money is to come from the federal and city
governments, the rest from private donations.
	   Eisenmann's design _ some 2,500 pillars resembling a cemetery _
is favored by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the project's private
backers, but the city has yet to make its decision.
	   Mayor Eberhard Diepgen and several other council members have
recently said they don't like any of the finalists and questioned
whether such a sweeping memorial can or should be built at all.
	   Kohl, one of the memorial's strongest backers, has been
pressuring Diepgen, a fellow Christian Democrat, to bring the
matter to a vote before national elections on Sept. 27.
	   A national Greens party leader, Juergen Trittin, said Monday the
decision should not be put off. ``We think this entire fight is
unworthy,'' he said.

Ceausescu villas to open for foreign tourists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Want to sleep in a dictator's bed?
Swim in a mosaic-lined swimming pool? A spot of hunting before
breakfast?
	   Romania's cash-strapped government is lining up a luxury package
for foreign tourists with cash to spare and a taste for something
off the beaten track to stay at palaces and villas belonging to
late Communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu.
	   A night at one of Ceausescu's abodes likely will cost dlrs 3,000
to dlrs 4,000, Mihai Nica, the government commercial director of
the houses, said Monday.
	   ``Guests will get a really special reception,'' he said. ``They
will be able to relax and at the same time think this belonged to
Ceausescu, who was a dictator.''
	   The tours, which will include hunting and excursions at some of
the villas, will likely start next spring. Palaces in Bucharest,
the upscale resort of Snagov and two villas in Transylvania are
among those that may be included.
	   Ceausescu, who was executed during the 1989 anti-Communist
revolt, kept luxury villas and palaces in almost every county. Many
are near woods so the former dictator could indulge his passion for
hunting.
	   Nica said the government will use the funds for the upkeep of
the palaces and the dozens of government guest houses used for
foreign dignitaries.

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ An unexploded U.S. missile reportedly
has been found in western Pakistan, but Pakistani officials would
not comment Monday after a similar report last week turned out to
be wrong.
	   Local officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
missile was found in a remote area Sunday and handed over to the
military the same day, four days after U.S. missiles struck a
suspected militant training camp in neighboring Afghanistan. They
said the missile fell in Kharan, 600 kilometers (375 miles) south
of the U.S. target near Khost, Afghanistan.
	   No injuries or damage was reported.
	   Spokesmen for the foreign ministry and the military said Monday
the report could not be confirmed.
	   Pakistan had protested the presumed violation of its air space
in the U.S. attack, and said earlier that a missile had mistakenly
fallen in Pakistan and killed several people. The government fired
its intelligence chief, Manzoor Ahmed, for passing on that false
report to the prime minister.
	   The United States shot 73 Tomahawk missiles at six targets in a
camp in eastern Afghanistan linked to Saudi dissident Osama bin
Laden, whom U.S. officials suspect is linked to the Aug. 7 bombings
of two U.S. embassies in East Africa. Those attacks killed 257
people and wounded 5,500.
	   The U.S. attack on a neighboring Muslim country has prompted
daily anti-American protests around Pakistan. Monday, 200 Afghan
refugee schoolgirls led by their veiled teachers chanted ``Destroy
America!'' in a peaceful march in the Pakistani border city of
Peshawar.
	   Also Monday, an Italian military plane picked up the body of a
U.N. military observer killed by gunmen in Afghanistan a day after
the attacks. An international honor guard of other military
observers escorted the coffin, draped in a blue U.N. flag, onto the
plane in the Pakistani capital.
	   Most foreign aid workers have left Afghanistan.
	   On Monday, the U.S. State Department warned Americans against
traveling to Afghanistan, and called on any Americans still there
to leave as soon as they can.
	   There have been no American diplomats in Afghanistan since the
United States closed down its embassy there in 1989. All Americans
with the United Nations also were evacuated from Afghanistan on the
advice of the State Department following the Africa bombings.

Player given 11-week ban after positive drug test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Representative winger Adam MacDougall
received a 11-week ban for returning a positive test to a banned
stimulant at an Australian rugby league hearing Monday.
	   MacDougall, who played for New South Wales in this year's State
of Origin series, might be eligible to play in this season's final,
having spent eight weeks on the sideline pending his hearing.
	   MacDougall, who was found guilty of taking the stimulant
amfepramone and received a warning for a positive test to
ephedrine, may also face a further, more serious steroid charge.
	   However, he is still awaiting a third test to determine his
naturally occuring levels of epitestosterone to testosterone after
returning a ratio greater than the normally acceptable 6:1 ratio
during the same drug test on June 6.

Anti-apartheid leader Boesak pleads innocent in fraud trial

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Allan Boesak, once a prominent
figure in the struggle against white rule, on pleaded innocent
Monday to charges he stole money intended for the anti-apartheid
cause.
	   At the start of a trial expected to last at least three months,
Boesak sat impassively in the dock as state prosecutor J. C. Gerber
read out 32 charges of fraud and theft totalling nearly 1.1 million
rand _ worth nearly dlrs 300,000 at the time.
	   His lawyer, Mike Maritz, entered Boesak's innocent plea.
	   Boesak, a former minister who once headed the World Alliance of
Reformed Churches, is accused of stealing cash from the Foundation
for Peace and Justice, which he operated from 1988 to 1994.
	   Donations came from singer Paul Simon, the Coca-Cola Foundation,
Scandinavian aid agencies and others.
	   Freddie Steenkamp, Boesak's bookkeeper at the foundation, was
sentenced last year to six years in jail after pleading guilty to
embezzling cash. During his trial Steenkamp testified he was only
following Boesak's example.
	   Boesak has paid back some of the missing money.
	   Once a top African National Congress official in the Cape Town
area, Boesak played a prominent role in the anti-apartheid struggle
that ended in the country's first all-race elections in 1994.
	   He gave up an appointment as ambassador to the United Nations in
Geneva when the scandal involving his charity emerged, and left
South Africa to lecture in the United States for a year.
	   When he returned to South Africa last year, he was greeted at
the airport by Justice Minister Dullah Omar and a crowd of cheering
supporters. The incident provoked uproar among opposition
politicians who accused the ANC of covering up for Boesak.
	   An ANC investigation cleared him of wrongdoing, but Scandinavian
donors criticized the probe and prosecutors later filed charges.
	   Speaking to reporters on the steps of Cape Town's High Court,
Boesak said he was relieved the case had started after long delays
over funding for his defense.
	   ``It has been a long, dark haul. Now the case has finally
started I am very happy,'' he said, wearing a dark blue suit and
surrounded by cheering supporters.
	   The prosecution's first witness, Dawn King, a forensic
accountant, led off an explanation of the church alliance's
accounts that is expected to dominate court proceedings for the
next three weeks.

Korean woman forced into sexual slavery by Japanese returns to
</HEADLINE>
Taiwan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ More than 50 years after being forced into
sexual slavery by the Japanese army, South Korean Lee Yong-soo says
returning to the site of her wartime brothel in Taiwan has
strengthened her resolve to extract compensation and an apology
from the Japanese government.
	   ``Taiwan is my second home. I hope everyone will remember what
happened here, and I hope the Taiwanese and Korean people can join
in fighting for our rights against the Japanese,'' Lee said through
a translator on Monday before returning to Seoul.
	   During her three-day trip, Lee, 70, visited the former Japanese
air force base at Taoyuan, 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) south of
Taipei where she viewed the site of the brothel _ now replaced by
an officers club _ and said prayers for victims of Japanese wartime
sex slavery.
	   Recruited at age 16 as a cook and washer woman for the Japanese
army, Lee was forced to provide sex for flyers assigned to Kamikaze
suicide squadrons, an experience she says made her a pariah when
she returned home after the war.
	   Lee, now a student of international law at a South Korean
university, said she hoped her visit would convince Korean's to pay
more attention to the plight of former sex slaves.
	   ``So far Japanese and Taiwanese have given us more support than
the Korean people have. When I return to Korea, I plan to do my
best to cooperate with all international organizations to continue
to push for compensation and an apology,'' Lee said.
	   A Japanese colony from 1895 to 1945, Taiwan was a launching site
for the imperial army's southern advances and Taiwanese women,
particularly girls from aboriginal tribes, were also coerced into
service in battlefield brothels.
	   Historians estimate that as many as 200,000 women _ mostly from
Korea and other Asian countries _ were taken to front-line Japanese
brothels, of whom at least 300 are thought to remain alive.
	   Japan has offered U.S. dlrs 760,000 through a private Asian
Women's Fund to all surviving ``comfort women,'' as they were
called by the Japanese army.
	   But most victims have refused the offer, saying they want the
money and apology to come directly from the Japanese government to
force it to acknowledge its role in running the battlefield
brothels. Some 46 former comfort women have sued the government in
Japanese courts and are now awaiting a verdict in Tokyo District
Court.

United Nations pulls non-essential foreign nationals from
</HEADLINE>
Tajikistan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ The United Nations decided Monday to
withdraw all non-essential foreign staff from its missions in the
former Soviet republic of Tajikistan.
	   The announcement by U.N. envoy Jan Kubis was in response to the
killing last month of four U.N. workers. The group was ambushed
July 20 while on a regular patrol in the mountains about 90 miles
(140 kilometers) east of the capital Dushanbe. All were shot in the
head.
	   International staffers in the U.N. military observers' mission
and U.N. Development Program have been told not to travel to
Tajikistan, Kubis said. He said that there was no political motive
behind the travel ban and that it should not be interpreted as a
suspension of U.N. operations in the Central Asian country.
	   About 70 U.N. observers are stationed in Tajikistan to monitor a
peace deal reached last year that ended the five-year civil war.
	   Despite the accord, Tajikistan remains restive. There are
periodic clashes between the hard-line government and the mostly
Islamic opposition. Also, many warlords do not recognize the peace
deal and wage turf battles with one another.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission on Monday
approved the planned dlrs 66 billion merger of NationsBank Corp.
and BankAmerica Corp. saying it will not harm fair trade in the
15-nation European Union.
	   ``The primary effects of the merger will be found in the United
States,,'' the commission said in a statement.
	   The approval clears one of the last remaining regulatory hurdles
to a merger that will create the largest commercial banking
organization in the United States and the third largest in the
world, with assets of dlrs 580 billion and 4,800 branches in 27 U.S
states.
	   The two banks needed pproval for their merger of the EU
executive Commission if they want to do business in Western Europe.
	   On Aug. 17, the Federal Reserve Board voted 6-to-0 to approve
the merger of San Francisco-based BankAmerica Corp. and NationsBank
Corp., headquartered in Charlotte, N.C., provided they sell off 17
bank branches in Texas and New Mexico, the only states where the
two banks have overlapping operations.
	   The banks want to complete the merger by the end of September so
they can report combined third-quarter results in October. Two
separate shareholders meetings will be held Sept. 24 by the two
banks to approve the alliance.
	   Also Monday, the European Commission cleared Canadian
telecommunications company Northern Telecom Ltd.'s dlr 9.1 billion
takeover of California-based Bay Networks Inc. That clearances
follow approval from U.S. regulators.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, the
youngest premier in Europe after Russia's weekend government shift,
visited Poland on Monday to discuss the Russian crisis and
impending NATO membership.
	   Sergei Kiriyenko, the Russian prime minister dismissed Sunday,
was a year younger than the 35-year-old Orban, who met separately
with Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek and President Aleksander
Kwasniewski.
	   Summarizing their talks, Buzek said he and Orban believed
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's dramatic firing of the entire
government to bring back Viktor Chernomydrin as prime minister
would stabilize economic volatility in Russia.
	   Chernomyrdin ``has always been regarded as supporter of
reforms,'' Buzek said.
	   Russia last week devalued the ruble and froze debt payments,
prior to the weekend dismissal of the government.
	   The Russian crisis appeared to hurt the Hungarian forint
currency, which fell to record lows against the U.S. dollar on
Monday. Hungary's central bank said it might intervene to stabilize
the currency.
	   Poland's zloty currency, which fell from an artificially strong
position last week due to the Russian crisis, strengthened in early
trading Monday.
	   Orban said Hungary would set up a special telephone hot line
with Poland because ``in Poland, there is broader knowledge about
what is going in Russia and what may happen.''
	   But Buzek said there was no reason to panic.
	   ``The Polish and Hungarian economies seem to be pretty well
prepared for the situation which has arisen in Russia,'' he said.
	   The meetings also discussed plans for Poland and Hungary to join
NATO next year, and their efforts to become European Union members.

	   LONDON (AP) _ A Kenyan boy whose eyes were severely injured by
flying glass in the Aug. 7 bombing of the U.S. embassy in Nairobi
arrived Monday for treatment.
	   Stanley Matuma, 14, will be examined by doctors at Moorfields
Eye Hospital in central London, said Christine Miles, director of
operations at the hospital.
	   ``We believe the youngster's eyes were both blinded during the
explosion,'' said Ms. Miles. ``He suffered severe lacerations from
flying glass and there is severe hemorrhaging.''
	   The embassy bombing killed 247 people and injured more than
5,000. Ten people died in a nearly simultaneous blast at the U.S.
Embassy in Dar es Salaam, in neighboring Tanzania.
	   Ms. Miles said the Kenyan boy will be examined by consultant
Zdenek Gregor, who has close links with the Nairobi hospital where
he was being treated.

Suu Kyi ends standoff; students take to streets in protest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES BC-Myanmar-Suu Kyi and BC-Myanmar-Street Protests;
UPDATES with govt saying no protesters arrested, most NLD
sympathizers, grafs 7-8.

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Students risked their first street
protest against Myanmar's military regime in nearly two years
Monday, while Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi bowed to failing
health and ended a 13-day roadside standoff with the government.
	   Leaders of Suu Kyi's political party, the National League for
Democracy, had urged her to end the standoff at a bridge 32
kilometers (19 miles) outside Yangon, where her van had been
stopped since Aug. 12.
	   Suu Kyi's doctors said she was suffering from kidney and urinary
tract problems, low blood pressure and dizziness when they last
were allowed to see her Friday. Government officials said she
returned to the capital of her own free will in their care.
	   Earlier in Yangon, some 200 students, watched by about 400
bystanders, staged the first anti-government protest since December
1996. The crowd fled when truckloads of riot police arrived about
an hour later.
	   Blocking traffic at Hledan Junction near Yangon University, they
waved red flags with a yellow fighting peacock, the symbol of the
democracy movement and Suu Kyi's party.
	   ``Down with the totalitarian government!'' some chanted. ``Our
cause must succeed!'' Others sang the national anthem.
	   They ran down side streets as soon as the first truckload of
riot police appeared. Police chased them, but government officials
said later that none had been arrested. The intersection was closed
to traffic.
	   A government spokesman, on condition of anonymity, said that
most of the students were NLD sympathizers and said that Suu Kyi's
vehicle visited at the protest site on the way back from the
bridge, hours after the demonstration ended.
	   The protest was the most open act of discontent this month,
which has marked the 10th anniversary of a national uprising
against military rule that was eventually crushed by the army and
in which as many as 3,000 people died.
	   Anti-government groups _ including 18 foreign activists who were
deported after a week in detention for distributing leaflets _ have
been stepping up their activities and renewing demands for an end
to military rule.
	   The protesters distributed pamphlets signed by the Yangon
Students Union. Student unions have been illegal in Myanmar, also
known as Burma, since the military seized power in 1962.
	   The last street protests in Myanmar took place in December 1996,
and were organized by students demanding more civil rights and the
right to form a student union. The government closed the
universities to quell the protests. They remain shut.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, whose movements are tightly restricted, made a
fourth attempt Aug. 12 to drive to the western city of Bassein to
meet party members. As in previous attempts, she was stopped at a
checkpoint and not allowed to proceed.
	   The ruling State Peace and Development Council has asserted that
she risked assassination. The organization accused of plotting her
death, the Karen National Union, an ethnic insurgent group that
supports Suu Kyi, called the claims ``a calumny.''
	   ``If there is any danger of assassination to Daw Aung San Suu
Kyi, there is no doubt it must come from the SPDC or its loyal
lackeys,'' the KNU said in a statement. Daw is an honorific.
	   Meanwhile, Home Affairs Minister Col. Tin Hlaing met with two
members of the NLD's central executive committee. He had sought a
meeting with party Chairman Aung Shwe, who sent the lower-level
members instead.
	   The NLD said that the two sides ``expressed their respective
points of view.'' The government described the talks as ``frank and
cordial.'' Neither side disclosed the contents.
	   Meetings between the NLD and military are extremely rare.
Previous attempts at furthering discussions have foundered on the
party's insistence _ echoed by the international community _ that
the military reverse its refusal to include Suu Kyi.
	   Suu Kyi had set a deadline of last Friday for the government to
convene the parliament elected in 1990, in which the NLD won 82
percent of the seats. The military refused to honor the vote.
	   The deadline passed without action. The party then said it would
call the parliament without permission, an action that the
government said Monday would be illegal and sink hopes of further
talks.
	   Past attempts by the NLD to gather members of parliament have
been met with mass arrests.

Israel softens position on key issue, progress on pullback seen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath saying Israel
backed away from previous positions, grafs 11-14. Quote from
Israeli spokesman saying Palestinians have not submitted action
plan on preventing terrorism
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a sign of behind-the-scenes progress, Israel
has softened its position on a key precondition for withdrawing
from more land in the West Bank, an official said Monday.
	   The report of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's new
flexibility on procedure comes as U.S. envoy Dennis Ross is
exploring the possibility of a new round of mediation to wrap up
the long-stalled withdrawal agreement.
	   Hardliners in Netanyahu's coalition, meanwhile, renewed threats
to topple the government if he acceded to a U.S. proposal to hand
over an additional 13 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian
control.
	   According to an Israeli official who spoke on condition of
anonymity, Israel told U.S. negotiators that it would now agree to
start the withdrawal process without a new meeting of the
545-member Palestine National Council.
	   Netanyahu has demanded the PNC be reconvened to remove ambiguity
about whether it had canceled clauses in the PLO founding charter
which call for Israel's destruction. Palestinians have maintained
the PNC already took action to revoke the charter.
	   The official said Israel was now willing to accept a statement
from the 18-member PLO executive committee as a condition for
starting the withdrawal as long as a date for reconvening the PNC
would fall within the four-month period of phased pullbacks.
	   Netanyahu's office issued a statement denying an Israeli
newspaper report that the prime minister had reversed his stand on
the PLO charter.
	   It said that Netanyahu spoke to U.S. President Bill Clinton
about the issue Friday and said that amending the charter ``is a
basic condition of the agreement with the Palestinians.''
	   In the Norwegian capital of Oslo, Ross was expected to meet with
Palestinian Authority president Yasser Arafat and Netanyahu's
advisers. Afterwards, U.S. officials are expected to weigh the
feasibility of a new Mideast shuttle mission.
	   ``We've had a stalemate for a very long time, and it's very
important that we overcome that stalemate,'' Ross said in an
interview with the Norwegian state broadcast network NRK.
	   Palestinian officials said a new, exploratory channel had been
opened between Netanyahu confidant Yitzhak Molcho, and Ahmed
Qureia, the speaker of the Palestinian legislative council. They
also said Israel was backing away from previous positions.
	   ``The Israelis called us and said we have something new we want
to show you. They said, `we have abandoned our demand for the
convening of the PNC' and said that they are willing to withdraw
from 13 percent ...,'' said Nabil Shaath, a minister in Arafat's
Cabinet and a top negotiator.
	   That would not resolve all the issues, however.
	   Palestinian officials said they were not ready to accept Israeli
conditions on the use of 3 percent of the land targeted for the
next withdrawal. They also said Arafat would not drop his
insistence on a further pullback beyond the 13 percent.
Palestinians also refuse to give up demands for further prisoner
releases.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Netanyahu, said Israel was
awaiting a detailed plan from the Palestinians on how they were
going to crack down on militants and prevent terrorism.
	   ``At this point, they haven't presented a plan of action, and
they are resisting doing so,'' Bar-Illan told The Associated Press.
	   Netanyahu said in an interview with Fox News television that the
process had reached a ``critical stage.''
	   A group of 11 hard liners in Netanyahu's coalition, meanwhile,
called a meeting in the Knesset Monday in response to Israeli media
reports of progress in the negotiations.
	   The group, known has the Greater Land of Israel Front, has
pledged to topple Netanyahu's government should he agree to a 13
percent pullback.
	   ``We are holding this meeting to signal to the prime minister,
in case he has a short memory, that his coalition will not allow
him to do something against the wishes of the people who elected
him,'' Michael Kleiner, head of the group and a member of the
Gesher Party, told The Associated Press.
	   Netanyahu controls 66 of 120 seats in parliament, and the
Kleiner group could topple him.

Ferguson: Solskjaer is staying put
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Norwegian striker Ole Gunnar
Solskjaer is staying at Manchester United, manager Alex Ferguson
said Monday.
	   The international striker was linked with a 5.5 million pound
(dlrs 9 million) transfer to Tottenham Hotspur after Manchester
United signed Tobagan striker Dwight Yorke from Aston Villa for
12.6 million pounds (dlrs 20 million) last week.
	   But Ferguson insisted that Solskjaer, who has slipped to fifth
choice striker at Old Trafford, was not for sale despite Tottenham
officials saying United had accepted its bid.
	   ``Ole is going nowhere. He is not for sale and I'm happy he is
staying here,'' Ferguson said Monday.
	   Solskjaer is expected to be included in United's squad, which
flies out to Poland on Tuesday for the Champions' League game
against LKS Lodz on Wednesday.

Ceausescu villas to open for foreign tourists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Want to sleep in a dictator's bed?
Swim in a mosaic-lined swimming pool? A spot of hunting before
breakfast?
	   Romania's cash-strapped government is lining up a luxury package
for foreign tourists with cash to spare and a taste for something
off the beaten track to stay at palaces and villas belonging to
late Communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu.
	   A night at one of Ceausescu's abodes likely will cost dlrs 3,000
to dlrs 4,000, Mihai Nica, the government commercial director of
the houses, said Monday.
	   ``Guests will get a really special reception,'' he said. ``They
will be able to relax and at the same time think this belonged to
Ceausescu, who was a dictator.''
	   The tours, which will include hunting and excursions at some of
the villas, will likely start next spring. Palaces in Bucharest,
the upscale resort of Snagov and two villas in Transylvania are
among those that may be included.
	   Ceausescu, who was executed during the 1989 anti-Communist
revolt, kept luxury villas and palaces in almost every county. Many
are near woods so the former dictator could indulge his passion for
hunting.
	   Nica said the government will use the funds for the upkeep of
the palaces and the dozens of government guest houses used for
foreign dignitaries.

AOC seeks upgrade of sports doping penalties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; ADDS details, quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian athletes will face jail
terms for testing positive to sports drugs such as steroids if the
federal government heeds a call by Australian Olympic Committee
chief John Coates.
	   The AOC wants governments to raise the penalties for serious
sports drug offences to match penalties for dangerous narcotics,
such as heroin.
	   If the AOC plan is adopted, those guilty of trafficking
commercial quantities of sports drugs, such as anabolic steroids,
could face life imprisonment. A positive test or possession of hard
sports drugs could result in two-year jail sentences.
	   Coates released a report Monday which he has sent to national
and state governments and leading sports figures including
International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch.
The document backed, with details, a call by Australian IOC Kevan
Gosper last week in Lausanne for governments to join the war
against sports drugs.
	   ``Australia has an opportunity to lead the world in this regard
with the staging of the 2000 Olympics in Sydney and the current
international focus on doping in sport,'' Coates told a news
conference. ``Now is the time to act. If we're to ensure that the
2000 (Sydney) Olympics are not remembered as the drug games
immediate action is required.''
	   The AOC has discussed its plan with the Sydney Olympic
Organizing Committee and with IOC members Gosper and Phil Coles. It
sent a copy of its proposal to Prime Minister John Howard and the
leaders of all Australian states and territories.
	   The AOC has focussed on three areas of sports drugs and says
penalties for possession, manufacture and trafficking of these
drugs should draw the same penalties as serious narcotics such as
heroin and cocaine.
	   Coates said the three hard drug classes were anabolic androgenic
steroids, Beta 2 agonists (other than asthma medications) and
peptide and glycoprotein hormones and analogues.
	   The current ceiling for fines for importation of sports drugs
into Australia is about U.S. dlrs 30,000 while the maximum for
narcotics is life in jail. Chinese swimmer Yuan Yuan attempted to
illegally import enough growth hormones to supply 20 athletes
before the world championships earlier this year but escaped
without a fine and was allowed to enter the country.
	   Under the AOC plan Yuan would have faced a maximum penalty of 25
years jail.
	   ``She should have at least faced the courts,'' Coates said.
	   The AOC report said a magistrate in the Victoria state recently
applied the maximum allowable penalty of Aust dlrs 5,000 (U.S. dlrs
3,000) on two men caught importing steroids worth Aust dlrs 900,000
(U.S. dlrs 525,000).
	   ``That makes it a worthwhile risk for these dealers to deal in
the sports drugs instead of risking the penalties from narcotics,''
said AOC lawyer Simon Rofe.
	   Rofe said the governments could add the hard sports drugs into
the same category as narcotics within legislation. He said the laws
could be drafted within a month, with the biggest delay being
getting the laws into the parliamentary agenda.
	   A spokesman for Sports Minister Andrew Thomson said no comment
would be made by the government until they had read the full AOC
report.
	   Coates said he believed sports drugs posed as serious a social
risk to the community as narcotics.
	   He said the non-medical use of anabolic steroids in Australia
was now greater than heroin and cocaine and a survey of 11 to
17-year-old schoolchildren in New South Wales showed about four
percent were using anabolic steroids.
	   ``Criminal laws must be more stringent to deter those who would
otherwise engage in illegal dealing in drugs and to appropriately
punish those who are so engaged,'' Coates said.
	   He revealed that Australian athletes on the 2000 Olympic team
will have to sign agreements forcing them to repay all government
funding they have received in their careers if they test positive
during the Sydney games.

French foreign minister says Russia deserves support
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said Monday
that Russia deserves French support and that he believed Russia was
capable of rebuilding itself.
	   ``Russia has already confronted, with a great deal of composure,
energy and tenacity, considerable upheavals for the last 10
years,'' Vedrine said in an interview on France Inter radio.
	   `Therefore, I rather believe that in the medium and long-term
this country is up to building and building and deserves our
confidence,'' Vedrine said.
	   The French president and government had no immediate reaction to
the latest political developments in Russia.

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix slug &QL; 
 &UR; Toms River, New Jersey 13, Jenison, Michigan 9 &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS and UPDATES with late games &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID KINNEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WILLIAMSPORT, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Brad Frank capped the longest
game in Little League World Series history with an RBI single in
the top of the 11th inning as Toms River, New Jersey, beat Jenison,
Michigan, 13-9 Sunday night.
	   The 3-hour, 11 minute-game topped in both time and innings the
2-hour, 51-minute, nine-inning marathon in 1971 between Tainan,
China, and Gary, Indiana.
	   Jenison's Derek Stempin hit two home runs, including a two-out,
two-strike solo shot to force extra innings.
	   In Sunday's other game, 12-year-old Sayaka Tsushima became the
first girl to play for the Far East team in the World Series, going
1-for-2 with a single, walk and two runs scored as Kashima, Japan,
defeated the defending champions from Guadalupe, Mexico, 6-1.
	   Jenison and Toms River went back and forth early, and Jenison
led 8-7 after the third.
	   Frank had an RBI single in the fifth to tie the game 8-8 and Joe
Franceschini's RBI hit gave Toms River the lead in the sixth. After
Stempin's homer tied it again, both teams went on a four-inning
drought.
	   Toms River finally took the lead for good in the 11th. Frank's
single up the middle drove in Chris Cardone with the go-ahead run
and two more scored when shortstop Sean Markle allowed Gabe
Gardner's grounder to go through his legs.
	   Casey Robrahn walked Casey Gaynor with the bases loaded to force
in the final run.
	   Billy Miller hit a two-run homer for Jenison, and Toms River's
Todd Frazier hit a 250-foot grand slam in the third.
	   While Toms River and Jenison were slugging it out, Sayaka was
beaming over her accomplishments.
	   ``I'm very happy,'' Sayaka said through an interpreter.
	   Sayaka has played baseball for about 2 1/2 years and is one of
the team's best athletes. She also plays golf and soccer.
	   ``She's the No. 1 fighter on the team,'' manager Atsushi Ohkawa
said also through an interpreter.
	   Starting pitcher Tetsuya Furukawa was the best player Sunday. He
gave up four hits, struck out seven and tripled, doubled and drove
in a run.
	   ``The whole game I was satisfied,'' Ohkawa said. ``The pitcher
pitched the whole game with patience.''
	   Kashima scored two runs in the second on a passed ball and two
wild pitches by Guadalupe's Daniel Lopez. A pair of throwing errors
on a sacrifice bunt in the fifth made it 3-0, before Furukawa's RBI
double.
	   Another passed ball and Tomoyuki Okawa's RBI single gave Kashima
a 6-0 lead.
	   ``Sometimes, when they're down, they can come back, but today
wasn't one of those days,'' manager Jose Valdez said.
	   Jose Oregel's sixth-inning home run provided the only run for
Guadalupe.
	   The Latin American champions stranded seven runners. They
threatened in the fourth and fifth, but Furukawa ended both innings
with strikeouts.
	   Guadalupe returns three players from the 1997 championship team,
and a coach, Jose Valadez, is now the manager. Only one team has
won consecutive titles on the field: Monterrey, Mexico _ a town
just a few miles from Guadalupe _ in 1957-58.
	   In 1992, after losing 15-4, Long Beach, California, was credited
with a 6-0 championship victory when the Philippines was stripped
of the title for using over-age and ineligible players. Long Beach
defeated Panama in the finals one year later to reclaim the crown.
	   The top two teams in both the U.S. pool and international pool
meet Thursday with a trip to the finals at stake. The championship
is Saturday.
	   ``The first win is very valuable,'' Ohkawa said. ``If we win in
the first game it makes it much easier to keep the pitchers in
rotation and keep the kids animated.''

Vatican: Probe of cardinal raises church-state problems
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAPLES, Italy (AP) _ The Vatican on Monday said the
loan-sharking probe of Naples' cardinal raised problems of
church-state relations, but prosecutors were going ahead with their
investigation of the prelate's personal financial dealings.
	   ``Obviously, the way in which a respected bishop and cardinal
was treated touches on problems of church-state relations,''
Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said in statement issued in
Vatican City.
	   On Saturday, about 30 agents from Italy's tax police branch went
through files in the offices of Cardinal Michele Giordano,
archbishop of this city, one of the country's major dioceses.
	   Because the cardinal has a diplomatic passport and because Italy
and the Vatican have an elaborate treaty governing relations,
including legal matters, the probe immediately raised questions
about whether the prosecutors were acting properly.
	   Navarro-Valls did not indicate whether the Vatican would
formally raise objections to the prosecutors, but he reiterated
that the Holy See was following the case.
	   The probe of the cardinal is linked to that of the prelate's
brother, Mario Lucio Giordano, who was arrested last week for
investigation of loan sharking, extortion and criminal association.
	   Loan sharking is a major racket for the Camorra crime syndicate,
which holds sway in the Naples area.
	   The probe of the cardinal is part of a wider investigation of a
suspected multimillion dollar loan-shark business.
	   RAI state TV said prosecutors from the neighboring region of
Basilicata, who are conducting the probe, were going ahead with
their work despite the reservations of the Vatican and objections
by the cardinal himself, who has denounced what he called dangers
to church sovereignty.
	   He particularly objected to telephone taps, which were
reportedly carried out.
	   However, in an interview with RAI TV on Monday, the cardinal
said that in accordance with the Vatican-Italy pacts, ``as an
Italian citizen, I'll stand up to the charges.''
	   The cardinal has said he wrote blank checks from his personal
funds to his brother, who had business problems.
	   Italian newspapers reported Monday that some funds that the
cardinal kept in the Vatican's bank are suspected of ending up in
his brother's bank account.
	   Meanwhile, experts debated how much leeway prosecutors had when
investigating a church leader.
	   ``It's an area that's really not well-charted,'' said Giovanni
Conso, a leading jurist and former justice minister. ``We're
walking a very fine line between legal and illegal.''
	   Conso noted that the Vatican-Italian concordat protects places
of worship from outside interference but also added that the search
of the cardinal's financial records took place in the archbishop's
office, not in a church.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The Jordanian government is offering Amman
residents water free of charge for three months, an official said
Monday.
	   The previous government resigned last week amid a scandal over
polluted drinking water.
	   Munther Khleifat, secretary-general of the Water Authority, said
the decision to offer water free of charge was made by Crown Prince
Hassan, who is running the affairs of the country in the absence of
his brother, King Hussein. Hussein is receiving cancer treatment in
the United States.
	   Residents of the upscale suburbs of western Amman had complained
that water flowing out of taps for three weeks had an odor and
contained worms and larvae.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The Jordan Hotels and Tourism Company
earned a profit of 839,000 Jordanian dinars (dlrs 1.2 million)
during the first six months of this year, Al Arab Al Yowm daily
reported Monday.
	   The profit margin was 28 percent lower than that during the same
period last year, the paper added.
	   The company owns the largest hotels in Amman, including the
five-star Intercontinental Hotel. Its total assets total an
estimated 32.8 million dinars (dlrs 46.2 million).
	   The hotel business in the Kingdom has suffered a 10-percent
decline _ or 1.6 million dinars (dlrs 2.2 million) _ this year, due
to a fall in foreign tourism. The drop is blamed on the
deteriorating political situation in the Middle East.
 &UR; ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The new National Mobile Telecommunications Co.
said Monday it expected to start offering its services in April. It
said it has chosen Germany's Detecon to operate its network.
	   An NMTC statement said the company has signed a memorandum of
understanding with Detecon, a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom AG. It
did not provide the value of the agreement. A company official said
the figure will not be made public before the contract is sealed.
	   NMTC will break the monopoly of the Mobile Telecommunications
Co., which has been the sole provider of mobile phone and pager
services in this oil-rich state.
	   The new company is 24 percent owned by the government. Its
paid-up capital is 30 million dinars (dlrs 98.03 million). The
government also owns 49 percent of MTC.

Muslims protest strikes outside U.S. Embassy

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ In a protest Monday outside the U.S.
Embassy, leaders of the Islamic movement in Israel condemned the
American air strikes against suspected terrorist strongholds in
Sudan and Afghanistan as an attack on all Muslims.
	   The protest drew about 30 people, including Mohammed Damashe,
the deputy leader of the Islamic movement which is becoming
increasingly influential among Israel's 1 million Arab citizens.
	   About 50 police officers guarded the embassy but did not try to
push back the demonstrators who held banners reading ``We won't
forgive and we won't forget'' and ``Clinton kills innocent people
in cold blood.''
	   ``We are here to protest the American attack. We see it as an an
attack against all Muslims,'' Damashe said.
	   In a separate protest, about 70 members of the radical Islamic
Jihad group chanted ``Death to America'' and burned four U.S. and
two Israeli flags in Gaza City.
	   Nafiz Azzam, the spiritual leader of Islamic Jihad in the
Palestinian areas, said the United States could expect retribution
for the strikes. ``It is natural and necessary that there be
revenge for the blood of Muslims,'' Azzam said.
	   The anti-American rallies in the Palestinian areas have been
relatively small in scale _ in sharp contrast to earlier this year
when thousands of Palestinians to the streets in support of Iraq in
its showdown with the United States over weapons inspections.
	   Iraq's confrontation with the United States was widely perceived
as an Arab issue, while the Palestinians don't feel such close ties
to Sudan and Afghanistan which are Muslim but not considered key
players in the Arab world.

Thai govt struggles to prop up automobile industry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The government issued seven measures
Monday to bolster the flagging automobile industry and prevent more
layoffs.
	   The local industry has suffered plummeting sales since
Thailand's once-booming economy shriveled as the Asian crisis took
hold last year. Few Thais are buying cars and the crisis has dried
up export markets in neighboring countries.
	   Akapol Sorasuchart, a government spokesman, said the measures
include a plan to provide low-interest loans through a Thai
development bank to small- and medium-sized and operators in the
automobile and related industries.
	   The government approved a loan worth dlrs 122.9 million,
received from the Asian Development Fund to relend to automobile
operators and manufacturers in supporting industries seeking to
restructure, and another 100 million baht (dlrs 2.5 million) loan
for those seeking to upgrade production technology.
	   The finance and industry ministries were ordered to consider
increasing tax benefits for automobile exporters.
	   The Thai automobile industry has already slashed the pre-crisis
workforce of 85,000 people by 30 percent. Employers are threatening
to eliminate all but skeleton staffs.
	   During January to June, Thailand produced just 15 percent of
full-year forecast of 150,000 units. In the same period, local car
sales plunged 72 percent year-on-year.
	   Before the crisis, Thailand was ranked as the world's
second-largest producer of pick-up trucks and fourth-largest maker
of motorcycles.

Illegal foreign workers unwelcome in Thailand: Survey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Many Thais believe illegal foreign
workers should be sent home to free up jobs for Thais unemployed
because of the economic crisis, a poll showed Monday.
	   A recent survey of 2,173 people conducted by the Rajabhat
Institute in Bangkok and the surrounding area showed that 78
percent believed that the country no longer needs foreign workers,
who were in demand two years ago when the economy was still
booming.
	   Nearly 69 percent of those surveyed favored repatriating illegal
foreign workers back to their countries.
	   More than 53 percent said such workers are hired because they
are willing to work longer hours for lesser pay than Thais, while
20 percent believe it is because they do not complain about poor
working conditions.
	   Thailand is an economic magnet for much of Southeast Asia,
drawing poor workers from impoverished neighbors Myanmar, also
known as Burma, Cambodia and Laos.
	   The government has begun expelling illegal foreign workers in an
effort to free up jobs for unemployed Thais.
	   As is customary with Thai polls, no margin of error was given.

Ukrainian president hopes for Chernomyrdin's approval
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma expressed
hope Monday that the Russian parliament would confirm Viktor
Chernomyrdin as prime minister.
	   ``We cannot remain indifferent to what is happening in a
neighboring country,'' Kuchma said.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin reappointed Chernomyrdin as
acting prime minister on Sunday after dismissing the Cabinet of
Sergei Kiriyenko, a young reformer who was unable to contain
Russia's financial crisis.
	   Ukraine has been worried about the crisis, which in addition to
leading to a de facto devaluation of the Russian ruble has brought
down its own hryvna currency. Ukrainian officials are concerned
that the Russian crisis might aggravate the exodus of foreign
investors from Ukraine and harm trade with Russia, the country's
largest economic partner.
	   The events in Russia demonstrate how important it is to have a
``strong and stable government,'' Kuchma said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   ``We are also looking at the situation in Ukraine from this
angle,'' the president said.

Spaniard does high-tech research into the secret life of ham
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ In an odd marriage of science and
gastronomy, Spanish researchers are using a CAT scan to see what
goes on inside ham.
	   A Spanish physicist has been probing the technical side of
ham-curing _ how the salt spreads through the ham, optimum
temperature and humidity and so forth. He's even come up with a
computer model.
	   The project is the brainchild of Juan Atanasio Carrasco, who is
trying to help producers minimize the number of hams that spoil
before reaching store shelves, the newspaper El Pais reported.
	   Not just any ham, but some of Spain's finest _ 'jamon iberico',
a pricy cut that is roughly like Italian prosciutto, only darker
and chewier.
	   The delicacy is produced by covering a raw pork leg with rock
salt for several days, washing it off then hanging it from a
warehouse roof for as long as 2 1/2 years.
	   With funding from ham producers, Carrasco and his team have
attached sensors to four hams in Guijuelo to monitor them as they
cure.
	   And under an agreement with the Spanish health ministry,
periodically he takes the hams to the October 12th Hospital in
Madrid to have a peek at their innards with a CAT scan.
	   This diagnostic tool -- which renders cross-sectional images
using computerized axial tomography -- allows doctors to examine
tissues without cutting into them.

Human rights group reports on dead and missing in Indonesian
</HEADLINE>
province

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Almost 800 people have been killed
during military operations over the last decade in the northern
province of Aceh, a human rights panel said Monday.
	   A team from Indonesia's National Human Rights Commission
returned Sunday from the Sumatra island province, where
investigators dug up bodies of people believed killed by the
military.
	   In Jakarta, the government-sponsored team released data about
alleged atrocities in Aceh, where soldiers put down a separatist
insurgency in the late 1980s and 1990s.
	   At least 160 people are missing and as many as 368 were
tortured, said commission member Baharuddin Lopa. The figures were
compiled from local human rights groups in Aceh.
	   Lopa said his team dug up 17 skeletons as well as bones from
dozens of other victims in mass graves during a three-day trip.
	   The inquiry by the national human rights commission is the
latest sign of a new openness since former President Suharto
resigned in May after nationwide riots and student protests.
	   Indonesia's military commander, Gen. Wiranto, has publicly
apologized for human rights violations in Aceh and ordered the
withdrawal of about 1,000 troops. However, thousands remain
deployed in the province, which lies 1,750 kilometers (1,100 miles)
northwest of Jakarta.

Dehydrated Suu Kyi ends standoff; students hold protest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with senior NLD figure saying Suu Kyi dehydrated,
hypoglycemic shock feared, grafs 4-5. Trims

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Students risked their first street
protest against Myanmar's military regime in nearly two years
Monday, while Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi bowed to failing
health and ended a 13-day roadside standoff with the government.
	   Suu Kyi's political party, the National League for Democracy,
had urged her to come home from a bridge 32 kilometers (19 miles)
outside Yangon, where her van had been stopped since Aug. 12.
	   Suu Kyi's doctors said she was suffering from kidney and urinary
tract problems, low blood pressure and dizziness when they last
were allowed to see her Friday. Government officials said she
returned to the capital of her own free will in their care.
	   Tin Oo, an NLD vice chairman, reported that the doctors told Suu
Kyi on Monday she was suffering from dehydration and possible
hypoglycemic shock. She was persuaded to voluntarily return.
	   ``Her health hasn't improved,'' Tin Oo said. ``The jaundice
hasn't improved. She's suffering from dehydration. They were
worried she might be suffering from hypoglycemia.''
	   Earlier in Yangon, some 200 students, watched by about 400
bystanders, staged the first anti-government protest since December
1996. It appeared to catch authorities by surprise and lasted an
hour before riot police arrived.
	   Blocking traffic at Hledan Junction near Yangon University, they
waved red flags with a yellow fighting peacock, the symbol of the
democracy movement and Suu Kyi's party.
	   ``Down with the totalitarian government!'' they chanted. ``Our
cause must succeed!''
	   They ran down side streets as soon as the first truckload of
riot police appeared. Police chased them, but government officials
said later that none had been arrested. The intersection was closed
to traffic.
	   A government spokesman, on condition of anonymity, said that
most of the students were NLD sympathizers and said that Suu Kyi's
vehicle visited the protest site on the way back from the bridge,
hours after the demonstration ended.
	   The protest was the most open act of public discontent this
month, which has marked the 10th anniversary of a national uprising
against military rule that was eventually crushed by the army and
in which as many as 3,000 people died.
	   Anti-government groups _ including 18 foreign activists who were
deported after a week in detention for distributing leaflets _ have
been stepping up their activities and renewing demands for an end
to military rule.
	   The protesters distributed pamphlets signed by the Yangon
Students Union. Student unions have been illegal in Myanmar, also
known as Burma, since the military seized power in 1962.
	   The last street protests in Myanmar took place in December 1996
and were organized by students demanding more civil rights. The
government closed the universities to quell the protests. They
remain shut.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, whose movements are tightly restricted, made a
fourth attempt Aug. 12 to drive to the western city of Bassein to
meet party members. As in previous attempts, she was stopped at a
checkpoint and not allowed to proceed.
	   The ruling State Peace and Development Council has asserted that
she risked assassination. The organization accused of plotting her
death, the Karen National Union, an ethnic insurgent group that
supports Suu Kyi, called the claims ``a calumny.''
	   ``If there is any danger of assassination to Daw Aung San Suu
Kyi, there is no doubt it must come from the SPDC or its loyal
lackeys,'' the KNU said in a statement. Daw is an honorific.
	   Meanwhile, Home Minister Col. Tin Hlaing met two members of the
NLD's central executive committee. He had sought a meeting with
party Chairman Aung Shwe, who sent the lower-level members instead.
	   The NLD said that the two sides ``expressed their respective
points of view.'' The government called the talks ``frank and
cordial.'' Neither disclosed the contents.
	   Such meetings are extremely rare. Previous attempts at
furthering discussions have foundered on the party's insistence _
echoed by the international community _ that the military reverse
its refusal to include Suu Kyi.
	   Suu Kyi had set a deadline of last Friday for the government to
convene the parliament elected in 1990, in which the NLD won 82
percent of the seats. The military refused to honor the vote.
	   The deadline passed without action. The party then said it would
call the parliament without permission, an action that the
government said Monday would be illegal and sink hopes of further
talks.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ A small air force plane carrying supplies to a
remote community in Peru's Amazon jungle made an emergency landing
shortly after taking off Sunday, injuring the five people on board.
	   The single-motor plane landed amid houses outside the jungle
capital of Iquitos, 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) northeast of Lima,
minutes after taking off from Iquitos' airport, an air force
communique said.
	   Two crew members and a mother and father with their child
sustained light injuries in the forced landing. There were no
reports of injuries on the ground.
	   The plane was carrying blankets, food and ammunition to the
village of Angamos and its army post near the Brazilian border.
	   The air force is investigating the cause of accident, the
communique said.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ An Israeli implicated in an attempt to

outside Bogota with a false Belgian passport, authorities said
Sunday.
	   Avi Salach was captured Saturday night after a five-year manhunt
by Colombian and Israeli police and Interpol, the international
police agency, Colombia's domestic security agency announced.
	   Another Israeli, Elias Cohen, was arrested when the cocaine was
seized before it left Colombia, and is serving a jail term in
Bogota, the agency said in a statement.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A bus driver fled from an accident

	   The Federal Highway Police said officials were looking for the

a vehicle carrying the seven family members.
	   Police said he was driving the bus to Iguacu Falls on the border
with Paraguay, about 670 miles (1,075 kilometers) west of Rio.
	   The tourists on the bus were not injured.
	   ___
	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) _ The government's human rights
ombudsman Sunday criticized Panama's deportation of 13 Cubans who
reportedly used false passports in a bid to travel to Miami.
	   A pregnant woman and three minors were among the 13 people
deported, human rights official Italo Antinori said. He said the
deportees might face reprisals when they return to Cuba.
	   The government acknowledged the Cubans were deported, but would
not say why.
	   Press reports said the Cubans used false passports when they
entered Panama. They were reportedly held at Panama City's
international airport, then sent back to Havana on Thursday.
	   Antinori, whose post has no enforcement power, recommended that
both governments allow the Cubans to return to Panama.

Israel increases security at airports following threats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITS to RESTORE EDS' NOTE &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPGRADES attribution throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LOD, Israel (AP) _ Israel is tightening security at its airports
in response to threats by Islamic militants to attack Israeli and
U.S. targets, including airlines, officials said Monday.
	   Threats against U.S. and Israeli targets emerged after last
week's U.S. air strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan that were aimed at
Osama bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire and Islamic militant linked to
the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa this month.
	   On Sunday, a leading Muslim activist close to bin Laden said
Islamic militants are preparing to retaliate for the air strikes by
targeting U.S. and Israeli strategic sites and airliners.
	   Pini Shis, a spokesman for Israel's Airport Authority, said
security was being tightened at Ben Gurion International Airport
near Tel Aviv and at airfields in Eilat and Tel Aviv.
	   ``Since the American activity in Afghanistan and Sudan, security
measures have been increased in Israeli airports,'' Shis told The
Associated Press. He would not specify what measures had been
taken.
	   Israel radio said cars entering Ben Gurion airport were being
checked more closely and some delays were reported in getting into
the airport.
	   In a related development, the Haaretz daily said that metal
detectors at Ben Gurion do not pick up certain items that contain
metal, including kitchen knives and big key chains.
	   Haaretz tested the five metal detectors in the departure hall
twice and found that the equipment did not pick up on metal items
weighing about 350 grams, or a little over half a pound.
	   Shis said security officials are aware that metal detectors
cannot alert security to every metal object.
	   ``Metal detectors are not the final answer in preventing terror
attacks,'' Shis told The Associated Press. ``The machines are only
one link in an entire chain of security measures.''
	   Shis would not specify which other means are used to check if a
person is carrying weapons.
	   Security measures at Ben Gurion are among the most stringent
worldwide. Motorists are stopped at checkpoints at the airport
entrances, with some passengers _ generally Palestinians _ being
questioned there and having their luggage checked.
	   In the departure lounge, tourists, Palestinians and Israeli Arab
citizens are questioned at length, while Jewish Israelis usually
undergo only a perfunctory check.

Former East German national team coach confesses to doping
</HEADLINE>
swimmers &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ In the latest confession of doping from former
East German sports figures, the former national women's swim team
coach admitted in court Monday that he secretly gave his athletes
banned performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Rolf Glaeser, 58, who has worked as a coach in Austria since
1990, also apologized to his former swimmers, including 1980
Olympic medalist Christiane Sommer, who won the medal under her
maiden name, Knacke.
	   Sommer testified against Glaeser during the trial, and said
after his confession that she wasn't sure how to react, but
suspected Glaeser was hoping to reduce his sentence.
	   Following the confession, Glaeser's case was separated from his
co-defendants, all of whom are charged with causing bodily harm for
administering steroids to minors. A verdict could come as soon as
Wednesday.
	   The charge carries a maximum of three years in prison, but other
coaches and sports doctors similarly charged received only fines
last week after confessing in a separate trial.
	   Glaeser coached the showcase Dynamo Berlin team from 1971-1984.
He told the court he first got the pink and blue pills in 1976 from
a co-defendant, Dr. Dinus Binus, who told him they helped muscle
regeneration.
	   He insisted he was not informed about possible dangers, and said
he never linked the side-effects he saw, such as acne or weight
gain, to the drugs.
	   Glaeser mentioned an interview during the 1976 Montreal
Olympics, when he was asked about his team's deep voices, and he
replied they were there to swim, not sing.
	   After coming home, he said he was told his young charges were
getting over colds. ``Today I reproach myself for not questioning
that,'' he said.
	   Binus confessed last month to a role in East Germany's
systematic doping. A second doctor and three other coaches on trial
have refused to make any statements.

Police offer reward for capture of talk show host assailants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Police and a radio station jointly posted a
reward of 4 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 512,820) Monday
for information leading to the arrest of two men who attacked a
popular talk show host with meat cleavers last week.
	   The two assailants escaped in a car after the attack, which
occurred last Wednesday outside Hong Kong's Commercial Radio
moments before Albert Cheng was to begin his talk show.
	   Cheng was hospitalised with severe cuts to his arms and legs.
	   Police said they were offering 1 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 128,205) in reward, and Commercial Radio was putting up the
rest of the money.
	   Although the 52-year-old Cheng has alienated many people with
his outspoken comments, police said the motive for the attack was
not known.
	   Well-known for outrageous attacks on officials and government
policies, Cheng hosts the morning talk show, Teacup in a Storm. He
is popular among blue-collar workers, many of whom enyoy venting
their anger at the government on air.

Congo delegate rejects talks until Uganda, Rwanda withdraw
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Congo's justice minister on
Monday rejected a cease-fire proposal, saying Uganda and Rwanda
must first withdraw their troops from Congolese territory.
	   ``Congo will refrain from attacking the withdrawing troops,''
said Mwenze Kongolo at a Pretoria press conference.
	   A summit convened by President Nelson Mandela, who heads the
14-member Southern African Development Community, proposed a
cease-fire Sunday.
	   Congo President Laurent Kabila sent Kongolo to the meeting. But
the presidents of Zimbabwe and Angola, who have sent troops to help
Kabila, did not attend.
	   Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni and Rwanda's President
Pasteur Bizimungu, who deny Kabila's charges that they are behind
rebels seeking to unseat him, attended the summit and agreed to the
cease-fire proposal.
	   Kongolo defended intervention by Zimbabwe and Angolan troops,
saying the Congo had the right to invite foreign troops as a signal
to Rwanda and Uganda that ``Congo is not alone and has friends.''
	   ``They will think twice about their aggression,'' Kongolo said.
	   Angolan troops drove rebel forces from a string of Atlantic
coast towns in a reversal of rebel gains, a senior Congolese
government advisor said Monday in Kinshasa.
	   Kabila has ruled with an iron fist since he ousted dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko from the former Zaire last year, and has alienated
ethnic groups _ mainly Tutsis with close ties to Uganda and Rwanda
_ that helped him.
	   The bitterness has fueled the rebel insurrection that Kabila is
trying to stem.
	   Kongolo accused South Africa of ``behind the curtain
maneuvers,'' alleging that South African Airlines had landed a
plane in Goma, Congo's eastern region where the insurgents are
concentrated.
	   ``We informed the South African government and we are still
waiting for their explanation,'' Kongolo said.
	   Foreign Affairs spokesman Machiel van Niekerk said officials
knew of ``no such plane in Goma.''
	   Mandela was mandated by SADC to contact the Organization of
African Unity and set up a mechanism for carrying out the
cease-fire proposal.
	   ``We should lose no time in ensuring that the cease-fire takes
place,'' Mandela said Monday.

 &UR; Former interior minister signs peace pact with opposition paper

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Former Interior Minister Hassan el-Alfy on
Monday signed an agreement withdrawing libel and defamation charges
against seven journalists and editors of a leading opposition
newspaper, police officials said.
	   The out-of-court settlement, signed in the office of Ragaa
el-Arabi, Egypt's prosecutor general, effectively ends a court
battle of more than one year of law suits filed by el-Alfy and his
son, Alaa, against the Islamic-oriented Al-Shaab newspaper.
	   It comes after senior government officials attempted to work out
an agreement between the two parties and evidence presented in
court by Al-Shaab's lawyers may have undermined the cases by the
former interior minister.
	   Under the agreement, el-Alfy agreed to drop all criminal and
civil suits against Al-Shaab editor-in-chief Magdi Hussein and six
other journalists, including Ibrahim Shukri, the paper's board
chairman and head of the opposition Al-Shaab party, said the
officials.
	   The officials, who spoke on customary condition of anonymity,
said the paper also agreed not to write more stories accusing
el-Alfy of misdoings.
	   El-Alfy resigned last November when President Hosni Mubarak
publicly criticized him for the lack of security at an ancient
temple near Luxor in southern Egypt where 58 tourists were
massacred. The interior minister is in charge of the police in
Egypt.
	   The cases against Al-Shaab stem from a series of reports that
focused on el-Alfy, accusing him and his family of abusing his
position for financial gain. The articles also targeted alleged
corruption in the ministry.
	   In February, Hussein was convicted of libeling el-Alfy and his
family. He was sentenced to two years in prison at hard labor, but
the sentence was reduced by an appeals court. Then the verdict was
overturned in July by Egypt's highest court.
	   The court freed Hussein and journalist Mohammed Helal from
prison and said ordered el-Alfy had to pay the trial costs.
	   The journalists had argued throughout the trials that they did
not violate any law and that their criticisms fell within the
limits of free expression.
	   Both parties signed the agreement separately and at different
times so as not to run into each other, according to the officials.
	   The text of the settlement stated that the journalists had no
malicious intention in printing the articles about el-Alfy. It also
said that el-Alfy acknowledged the right of free speech.
	   Six cases against Al-Shaab, all related to libel and defamation
charges, will be dropped under the agreement.
	   The five other journalists named in the settlement are Adel
Hussein, Salah Bedawi, Mohammed el-Shamy, Hoda Mekkawi and Essam
el-Sherkani.

Former East German national team coach confesses to doping

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ In the latest confession of doping from former
East German sports figures, the former national women's swim team
coach admitted in court Monday that he secretly gave his athletes
banned performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Rolf Glaeser, 58, who has worked as a coach in Austria since
1990, also apologized to his former swimmers, including 1980
Olympic medalist Christiane Sommer, who won the medal under her
maiden name, Knacke.
	   Sommer testified against Glaeser during the trial, and said
after his confession that she wasn't sure how to react, but
suspected Glaeser was hoping to reduce his sentence.
	   Following the confession, Glaeser's case was separated from his
co-defendants, all of whom are charged with causing bodily harm for
administering steroids to minors. A verdict could come as soon as
Wednesday.
	   The charge carries a maximum of three years in prison, but other
coaches and sports doctors similarly charged received only fines
last week after confessing in a separate trial.
	   Glaeser coached the showcase Dynamo Berlin team from 1971-1984.
He told the court he first got the pink and blue pills in 1976 from
a co-defendant, Dr. Dinus Binus, who told him they helped muscle
regeneration.
	   He insisted he was not informed about possible dangers, and said
he never linked the side-effects he saw, such as acne or weight
gain, to the drugs.
	   Glaeser mentioned an interview during the 1976 Montreal
Olympics, when he was asked about his team's deep voices, and he
replied they were there to swim, not sing.
	   After coming home, he said he was told his young charges were
getting over colds. ``Today I reproach myself for not questioning
that,'' he said.
	   Binus confessed last month to a role in East Germany's
systematic doping. A second doctor and three other coaches on trial
have refused to make any statements.

Israel softens position on key issue, progress on pullback seen

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath saying Israel
backed away from previous positions; Quote from Israeli spokesman
saying Palestinians have not submitted action plan on preventing
terrorism &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a sign of behind-the-scenes progress, Israel
has softened its position on a key precondition for withdrawing
from more land in the West Bank, an official said Monday.
	   The report of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's new
flexibility comes as U.S. envoy Dennis Ross is exploring the
possibility of a new round of mediation to wrap up the long-stalled
withdrawal agreement.
	   Hardliners in Netanyahu's coalition, meanwhile, renewed threats
to topple the government if he acceded to a U.S. proposal to hand
over an additional 13 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian
control.
	   According to an Israeli official who spoke on condition of
anonymity, Israel told U.S. negotiators that it would now agree to
start the withdrawal process without a new meeting of the
545-member Palestine National Council.
	   Netanyahu has demanded the PNC be reconvened to remove ambiguity
about whether it had canceled clauses in the PLO founding charter
which call for Israel's destruction. Palestinians have maintained
the PNC already took action to revoke the charter.
	   The official said Israel was now willing to accept a statement
from the 18-member PLO executive committee as a condition for
starting the withdrawal as long as a date for reconvening the PNC
would fall within the four-month period of phased pullbacks.
	   Netanyahu's office issued a statement denying an Israeli
newspaper report that the prime minister had reversed his stand on
the PLO charter.
	   It said that Netanyahu spoke to U.S. President Bill Clinton
about the issue Friday and said that amending the charter ``is a
basic condition of the agreement with the Palestinians.''
	   In the Norwegian capital of Oslo, Ross was expected to meet with
Palestinian Authority president Yasser Arafat and Netanyahu's
advisers. Afterwards, U.S. officials are expected to weigh the
feasibility of a new Mideast shuttle mission.
	   ``We've had a stalemate for a very long time, and it's very
important that we overcome that stalemate,'' Ross said in an
interview with the Norwegian state broadcast network NRK.
	   Palestinian officials said a secret channel had been opened
between Netanyahu confidant Yitzhak Molcho, and Ahmed Qureia, the
speaker of the Palestinian legislative council.
	   ``The Israelis called us and said we have something new we want
to show you. They said, `we have abandoned our demand for the
convening of the PNC' and said that they are willing to withdraw
from 13 percent ...,'' said Nabil Shaath, a minister in Arafat's
Cabinet and a top negotiator.
	   Palestinian officials said they were not ready to accept Israeli
conditions on the use of 3 percent of the land targeted for the
next withdrawal. They also said Arafat would not drop his
insistence on a further pullback beyond the 13 percent.
Palestinians also refuse to give up demands for further prisoner
releases.
	   As well, David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Netanyahu, said Israel
was awaiting a detailed plan from the Palestinians on how they were
going to crack down on militants and prevent terrorism.
	   ``At this point, they haven't presented a plan of action, and
they are resisting doing so,'' Bar-Illan told The Associated Press.
	   Netanyahu said in an interview with Fox News television that the
process had reached a ``critical stage.''

Malaysian won't protest U.S. film on prison life and legal system
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia has decided not to
protest a U.S. film that the government claims gives an inaccurate
portrayal of the country's legal system and prisons, a news report
said Monday.
	   Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said the false depiction
of Malaysian prisons in Polygram Films ``Return to Paradise'' would
be best addressed by explaining the actual situation in the media.
	   ``If it's the government (that made such allegations) then we
can issue an official protest, but if they are contained in
magazines, films and so on, then it becomes a bit difficult to do
so,'' Abdullah was quoted by the national news agency Bernama.
	   On Saturday, the Prisons Department lodged a police report
against the movie, which also has an official internet webpage in
which the director is quoted as saying that the film is a
fictionalised account based on the truth.
	   Abdullah said Malaysian commentators and intellectuals should
actively express their views in the media and on the Internet, and
not wait until they are ``provoked'' to do so.
	   Polygram Films ``Return to Paradise'' tells the tale of an
American man jailed on drug charges in Malaysia after a reckless
vacation with two friends in the northern state of Penang.
	   Some scenes in the film, recently released in the United States,
falsely, depict wardens torturing prisoners who are locked up in
cells infested with mice and cockroaches and refused medical
treatment.
	   Omar said the movie's producers were using the film to criticise
Malaysia's prison and justice system, particularly its law that
imposes the death penalty on drug traffickers.

Netanyahu: Jewish setters will never leave Hebron

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu quotes &QL;

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israel on Monday eased its siege of
Hebron, but Israeli troops enforced a curfew in the downtown area
for a fourth day and fired rubber bullets at Palestinian stone
throwers.
	   Tensions in the divided city have been running high since a
well-known rabbi was stabbed to death Thursday night in a Jewish
enclave of Hebron. The Israeli army has said the rabbi was killed
by a Palestinian and that the assailant fled to the Palestinian-run
part of Hebron.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded Monday that
Palestinian security forces do everything in their power to find
the killer.
	   However, the Palestinians' security chief in the West Bank, Col.
Jibril Rajoub, said Monday he would not help the Israelis.
	   ``It is not our job to protect them (the settlers). The crime
did not happen in an area under our control, so it is not our
responsibility,'' Rajoub told The Associated Press.
	   Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation is one of the
cornerstones of the autonomy agreements, but has flagged during the
17-month deadlock in negotiations on a further Israeli troop
withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   Netanyahu reiterated Monday that he would not move Jewish
settlers out of Hebron in an attempt to defuse the tension, as
demanded by the Palestinians and Israeli liberals.
	   ``We won't flee. We'll build. We won't evacuate,'' Netanyahu
said. On Sunday, Netanyahu's Cabinet approved plans to replace
trailers in the settler enclave where the rabbi was killed with
permanent homes.

him,'' Michael Kleiner, head of the group and a member of the
Gesher Party, told The Associated Press.
	   Netanyahu controls 61 of 120 seats in parliament, and the
Kleiner group could topple him.

Former interior minister signs peace pact with opposition paper

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to remove extraneous material in slug &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Former Interior Minister Hassan el-Alfy on
Monday signed an agreement withdrawing libel and defamation charges
against seven journalists and editors of a leading opposition
newspaper, police officials said.
	   The out-of-court settlement, signed in the office of Ragaa
el-Arabi, Egypt's prosecutor general, effectively ends a court
battle of more than one year of law suits filed by el-Alfy and his
son, Alaa, against the Islamic-oriented Al-Shaab newspaper.
	   It comes after senior government officials attempted to work out
an agreement between the two parties and evidence presented in
court by Al-Shaab's lawyers may have undermined the cases by the
former interior minister.
	   Under the agreement, el-Alfy agreed to drop all criminal and
civil suits against Al-Shaab editor-in-chief Magdi Hussein and six
other journalists, including Ibrahim Shukri, the paper's board
chairman and head of the opposition Al-Shaab party, said the
officials.
	   The officials, who spoke on customary condition of anonymity,
said the paper also agreed not to write more stories accusing
el-Alfy of misdoings.
	   El-Alfy resigned last November when President Hosni Mubarak
publicly criticized him for the lack of security at an ancient
temple near Luxor in southern Egypt where 58 tourists were
massacred. The interior minister is in charge of the police in
Egypt.
	   The cases against Al-Shaab stem from a series of reports that
focused on el-Alfy, accusing him and his family of abusing his
position for financial gain. The articles also targeted alleged
corruption in the ministry.
	   In February, Hussein was convicted of libeling el-Alfy and his
family. He was sentenced to two years in prison at hard labor, but
the sentence was reduced by an appeals court. Then the verdict was
overturned in July by Egypt's highest court.
	   The court freed Hussein and journalist Mohammed Helal from
prison and said ordered el-Alfy had to pay the trial costs.
	   The journalists had argued throughout the trials that they did
not violate any law and that their criticisms fell within the
limits of free expression.
	   Both parties signed the agreement separately and at different
times so as not to run into each other, according to the officials.
	   The text of the settlement stated that the journalists had no
malicious intention in printing the articles about el-Alfy. It also
said that el-Alfy acknowledged the right of free speech.
	   Six cases against Al-Shaab, all related to libel and defamation
charges, will be dropped under the agreement.
	   The five other journalists named in the settlement are Adel
Hussein, Salah Bedawi, Mohammed el-Shamy, Hoda Mekkawi and Essam
el-Sherkani.

Chernomyrdin back atop Russian government, Kiriyenko out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Nemtsov resigning, fresh quotes. Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin said Monday he recalled Viktor
Chernomyrdin to head the government because an experienced leader
was needed to tackle Russia's burgeoning crisis and restore
political and economic stability.
	   Chernomyrdin faces an unprecedented economic crisis, a feisty
parliament and a public skeptical that any change at the top can
improve its lot. His reappointment came one week after the Russian
government effectively devalued its national currency, the ruble,
and announced it would restructure the country's short-term debts.
	   A day after he dismissed the government of 36-year-old Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and named Chernomyrdin acting premier,
Yeltsin spoke to the nation in a televised address. He suggested
Chernomyrdin might be the best candidate to succeed him when his
term expires in 2000.
	   ``Today we need those whom we call heavy-weights. I consider
Chernomyrdin's experience and weight essential,'' he said.
	   ``There is another important reason for that proposal, that is,
to ensure continuity of the government in the year 2000,'' Yeltsin
said. ``Viktor Stepanovich's main advantages are decency, honesty,
and thoroughness. I think these qualities will be the decisive
argument in the presidential elections.''
	   Yeltsin thanked Kiriyenko for his ``courageous efforts to
improve the situation.''
	   Yeltsin asked the parliament to approve his candidate, but
parliamentary leaders asked for more than the customary seven days
to consider the appointment.
	   Yeltsin met with Chernomyrdin in his Kremlin office while
Kiriyenko held a farewell meeting with his colleagues in the
government headquarters known as the White House.
	   ``Come to work, come to battle,'' Yeltsin said to Chernomyrdin
as television cameras recorded the start of their meeting.
	   Chernomyrdin started consultations on the make-up of the new
government early Monday. He spoke with regional leaders, including
Gen. Alexander Lebed, the presidential hopeful who is governor of
the Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia.
	   The acting prime minister chaired the Cabinet meeting on Monday
afternoon, setting out his economic ideas and discussing the
government's relations with the parliament.
	   He said one priority of the new government should be support of
the country's commercial banking system, Interfax reported.
	   Viktor Chernomyrdin didn't offer details, but suggested that the
officials may select the fittest lenders to which they extend their
support.
	   ``Some (banks) won't take part, some won't fit and some will go
gradually under, this is what will happen,'' Chernomyrdin said.
	   Boris Nemtsov, a prominent economic reformer who was serving as
first deputy prime minister, tendered his resignation. While in
government, Nemtsov had fought to rein in the country's natural gas
monopoly, RAO Gazprom. That put him in conflict with Chernomyrdin,
who once headed the company.
	   The parliamentary leader of Chernomyrdin's Our Home is Russia
party, Alexander Shokhin, said it was unlikely that another
high-profile reformer, Anatoly Chubais, would be in the new
government.
	   Although Chernomyrdin is generally respected in political and
business circles, the sudden change seemed likely to further
undermine confidence in Yeltsin's leadership and do nothing to pick
up the spirits of Russians who have gone months without wages.
	   ``Chernomyrdin back in power is just the same thing. It doesn't
change anything,'' said Alexander Bazanov, a 40-year-old miner
taking part in a months-long picket outside the White House.
	   ``The government is a feed trough for government officials. The
Italian mafia doesn't have such feed troughs as we've got in
Russia.''
	   Chernomyrdin, who headed the Gazprom national gas monopoly
during the Soviet era, was Yeltsin's prime minister and steady
right-hand man from December 1992 until this March, when the
president said Russia needed new, more energetic leadership.
	   Chernomyrdin's government failed to pass comprehensive tax laws,
or stamp out rampant tax evasion among Russian companies.
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said the Chernomyrdin
nomination notwithstanding, the Communist-led majority in the
parliament was still calling for Yeltsin himself to step down and
for wide-ranging discussions on the formation of a coalition
government.
	   The ruble dropped 0.135 against the U.S. dollar on the interbank
currency exchange on Monday, to close sharply down at 7.14 rubles
to the dollar. Stocks in Gazprom, the company formerly headed by
Chernomyrdin, jumped 15 percent on Monday morning, Interfax
reported. Other blue-chip stocks dropped 6 percent to 9 percent by
afternoon.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan is lodging a complaint with
the U.N. Security Council after confirming that a U.S. missile
aimed at neighboring Afghanistan landed by mistake on its
territory, the Foreign Ministry said Monday.
	   The discovery over the weekend of an unexploded missile
supported Pakistan's presumption that the United States violated
its airspace to attack a neighbor, the ministry statement said.
	   Pakistan's representative to the United Nations has been
instructed to take up the matter with the Security Council,
according to the statement.
	   Local officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
missile was found in a remote area Sunday and handed over to the
military the same day, four days after U.S. missiles struck a
suspected militant training camp in neighboring Afghanistan. They
said the missile fell in Kharan, some 600 kilometers (375 miles)
south of the U.S. target near Khost, Afghanistan.
	   No injuries or damage was reported.
	   ``The government of Pakistan had informed us about this and we
are looking into it,'' U.S. Embassy spokesman Richard Hoagland
said.
	   The government earlier had to retract a similar report that a
U.S. missile fired at Afghanistan had landed in Pakistan and killed
several people. Pakistan fired its intelligence chief, Manzoor
Ahmed, for passing on the false report to the prime minister.
	   The United States fired 73 Tomahawk missiles at six targets in a
camp in eastern Afghanistan linked to Saudi dissident Osama bin
Laden. Bin Laden is accused of directing worldwide terror attacks
from Afghanistan, including the Aug. 7 bombings of two U.S.
embassies in East Africa that killed a total of 257 people.
	   The U.S. attack on a neighboring Muslim country has prompted
daily anti-American protests around Pakistan. Monday, 200 Afghan
refugee schoolgirls led by their veiled teachers chanted ``Destroy
America!'' in a peaceful march in the Pakistani border city of
Peshawar.
	   Also Monday, an Italian military plane picked up the body of a
U.N. military observer killed by gunmen in Afghanistan a day after
the attacks. An international honor guard of other military
observers escorted the coffin, draped in a blue U.N. flag, onto the
plane in the Pakistani capital.
	   Most foreign aid workers have left Afghanistan.
	   On Monday, the U.S. State Department warned Americans against
traveling to Afghanistan, and called on any Americans still there
to leave as soon as they can.
	   There have been no American diplomats in Afghanistan since the
United States closed down its embassy there in 1989. All Americans
with the United Nations also were evacuated from Afghanistan on the
advice of the State Department following the Africa bombings.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The United States has asked to open
security cooperation with Sudan and assured it last week's attack
on a Khartoum factory was aimed at terrorism, not at the Sudanese
government, the country's president said Monday.
	   President Omar Hassan el-Bashir made the comments in his first
news conference since Thursday's strike on a factory that U.S.
officials said manufactured chemical weapons agents but Sudan
insists made only medicines.
	   He said that the U.S. government had communicated with Sudan
through a third party, which he would not name, to say that his
country was ``not targeted in the attack, but terrorism.''
	   ``They also said that they wanted cooperation between the
Sudanese and the American security apparatus, and this happens for
the first time although they have refused a similar request we made
in the past,'' el-Bashir said.
	   Later, in an interview with The Associated Press, el-Bashir said
he was recalling Sudan's ambassador to Britain and would ask the
Foreign Office in London to recall its ambassador from Khartoum.
	   El-Bashir said he was reducing diplomatic representation to the
level of charge d'affaires in response to Britain's support for the
U.S. missile strike on the factory last week.
	   The president earlier called all Sudanese diplomats back from
Washington. On Monday he said American diplomats, who have been
working out of neighboring Kenya and Egypt since 1996, ``will not
be allowed to return to their work in Khartoum.''
	   He added that ambassadors from European countries who supported
the missile strike would be summoned ``to inform them of our strong
protest for their positions.''

President of Italian Olympic Committee questioned
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Questioned in an anti-doping investigation, the
president of Italy's Olympic committee said Monday he believes
there is no use of performance-enhancing substances among the
nation's soccer players.
	   ``I'm sure the word ``doping'' doesn't exist in soccer,'' Mario
Pescante told reporters after a two-hour meeting with the
prosecutor for the city of Turin, Raffaele Guariniello.
	   Guariniello is looking into allegations that top players in
Italy's first-division soccer league, Serie A, took illegal
substances.
	   Pescante also dismissed allegations that Italian Olympic
committee officials hid evidence that would prove the use of doping
substances by Serie A players.
	   The Italian Olympic committee's anti-doping commission is
carrying out a separate inquiry.
	   Both of the investigations stem from comments by AS Roma coach
Zdenek Zeman, who said he was amazed by the quick muscular
development of some players, including Gianluca Vialli and
Alessandro Del Piero.
	   Vialli and Del Piero both denied the allegations, and sued Zeman
for libel.
	   Over the weekend, a top doping investigator for the nation's
Olympic committee, Ugo Longo, said they have ``not found any
elements which makes it seem that doping exists in soccer.''
	   ``On the contrary, I'd say that we can rule it out,'' he said.
	   The investigations, however, continue.
	   Longo said he might go to London to question Chelsea's Italian
players, Pierluigi Casiraghi, Roberto Di Matteo and Gianfranco
Zola, who were summoned by Italy's Olympic committee but didn't
show up.
	   On Tuesday, AS Roma's and Italy's national team midfielder,
Luigi Di Biagio, is scheduled to appear before the Italian Olympic
committee.

Taiwan independence drive to go on, but China contacts welcomed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's main opposition party will
continue its drive for the island's formal independence, but also
encourages more contact with Chinese officials hostile to Taiwanese
sovereignty, the party's chairman said Monday.
	   In comments apparently intended to distance himself from the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party's more extreme anti-China
wing, Lin Yi-hsiung said the party was willing to ``engage in all
forms of exchange with those who hold contrary views.''
	   Lin said that includes eventually sending an official party
delegation to visit China, which claims Taiwan as a renegade
province and threatens to answer a declaration of independence with
invasion.
	   But he added that interaction with China would never be
permitted to compromise the DPP's basic commitment to maintaining
Taiwan's sovereignty and security.
	   ``Taiwan is a sovereign independent country. This is the DPP's
policy,'' Lin said in a meeting with members of the international
media.
	   Lin was installed as chairman of the DPP on Aug. 1 for a
two-year term. He was jailed for five years in the 1980s for
pro-democracy and independence activities under martial law imposed
by the Nationalist government that fled here in 1949 ahead of the
communist takeover of mainland China.
	   After twelve years as a political party, the DPP has toned down
its demands for independence as it edges towards the political
center. The party now says any change in Taiwan's status must first
be approved by a plebiscite.
	   But Lin said the development of vastly different social,
economic and political systems in Taiwan and China mandate
continued separation.
	   ``The reality is that Taiwan and China have been formally
separate for almost 100 years, and before that had little contact.
To change the reality artificially would create major problems,''
Lin said.
	   Made a Chinese province in 1885, Taiwan was ruled as a colony by
Japan from 1895 to 1945, and handed over to Chiang Kai-shek's
Nationalists at the end of World War II.
	   The Nationalists, who held on to power during a ten-year
transition to full democracy, advocate eventual reunification. But
surveys suggest that the vast majority of Taiwanese favor
maintaining the status quo of de-facto independence.
	   Recent remarks by U.S. President Bill Clinton which appeared to
favor China's policy of seeking eventual reunification only
reinforce the need for Taiwan to press its case overseas, Lin said.
	   Following major gains in local contests last year, Lin said the
DPP would consider an unprecedented power sharing deal with the
Nationalists if no party gained an outright majority of seats in
elections for the legislature in December.
	   The DPP now controls over a third of those seats, along with the
capital Taipei. The mayors of Taipei and the southern port city of
Kaohsiung will also be elected on December 5.

Netanyahu: Jewish setters will never leave Hebron
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu quotes &QL;

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israel on Monday eased its siege of
Hebron, but Israeli troops enforced a curfew in the downtown area
for a fourth day and fired rubber bullets at Palestinian stone
throwers.
	   Tensions in the divided city have been running high since a
well-known rabbi was stabbed to death Thursday in a Jewish enclave
of Hebron. The Israeli army has said the rabbi was killed by a
Palestinian who fled to the Palestinian-run part of Hebron.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded Monday that
Palestinian security forces do everything in their power to find
the killer.
	   However, the Palestinians security chief in the West Bank, Col.
Jibril Rajoub, said Monday he would not help the Israelis.
	   ``It is not our job to protect them (the settlers). The crime
did not happen in an area under our control, so it is not our
responsibility,'' Rajoub told The Associated Press.
	   Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation is one of the
cornerstones of the autonomy agreements, but has flagged during the
17-month deadlock in negotiations on a further Israeli troop
withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   Netanyahu reiterated Monday that he would not move Jewish
settlers out of Hebron in an attempt to defuse the tension, as
demanded by the Palestinians and Israeli liberals.
	   ``We won't flee. We'll build. We won't evacuate,'' Netanyahu
said. On Sunday, Netanyahu's Cabinet approved plans to replace
trailers in the settler enclave where the rabbi was killed with
permanent homes.
	   After Thursday night's killing, the army imposed a curfew on the
30,000 Palestinians living in the Israeli-controlled sector.
	   On Monday, troops detained 12 Palestinians after they broke
curfew and lined them up against a wall outside the Jewish enclave
of Beit Romano for an identity check.
	   About a dozen Palestinian children threw stones from rooftops
onto the Israeli soldiers. Troops fired two rubber bullets toward
the protesters. There were no reports of injuries.
	   After Thursday's killing, the army also sealed off all of
Hebron, barring Palestinians from entering on leaving the city. The
army eased the siege Monday, permitting some 6,000 workers and
merchants to leave town and go to jobs in Israel.
	   Hebron is the tensest town in the West Bank and there is
frequent friction between the 450 Jewish settlers and Hebron's
130,000 Palestinian residents.
	   Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, on
Monday published a list of 11 attacks by settlers against
Palestinians in the Hebron area, including beatings and shootings.
	   Tibi said the information was contained in complaints submitted
by victims to Israeli-Palestinian liaison offices in the area.
	   The Jewish community in Hebron is home to several far-right
extremists, including Baruch Marzel, an activist in the outlawed
anti-Arab Kach group. A leader of the Jewish settlement movement,
Aharon Domb, demanded Sunday that Marzel leave Hebron after he
accosted visiting President Ezer Weizman during a condolence visit
and called him a spy.

EU approves Nationsbank, BankAmerica merger; OKs Nortel takeover of

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS (AP) _ The European Union Commission has approved the
planned dlrs 66 billion merger of NationsBank Corp. and BankAmerica
Corp.
	   ``The primary effects of the merger will be found in the U.S.,''
the commission said in a statement Monday.
	   The approval clears one of the last remaining regulatory hurdles
to a merger that will create the largest commercial banking
organization in the U.S. and the third largest in the world, with
assets of dlrs 580 billion and 4,800 branches in 27 U.S. states.
	   On Aug. 17, the Federal Reserve Board voted 6-0 to approve the
merger of San Francisco-based BankAmerica Corp. and NationsBank
Corp., headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, on condition
that they divest 17 bank branches in Texas and New Mexico, the only
two states in which the two banks had overlapping operations.
	   The banks said earlier in August they wanted to complete the
merger by the end of September so they can report combined
third-quarter results in mid-October.
	   Two separate shareholders meetings will be held simultaneously
Sept. 24 by the two banks to approve the alliance.
	   Also Monday, the EU confirmed it had cleared Canadian
telecommunications company Northern Telecom Ltd.'s dlrs 9.1 billion
takeover of California-based Bay Networks Inc.
	   The companies said Friday that EU and Canadian regulators had
given them the green light for the merger. The clearances follow
earlier approval from U.S. regulators.

China plans tougher adoption law for foreigners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Adopting Chinese children will become tougher for
foreigners but easier for Chinese under a draft law the government
submitted to the legislature Monday.
	   The decision to screen foreigners more rigorously is designed to
provide greater protection and ``maximum safety'' for adopted
children, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Civil Affairs
Minister Doje Cering as telling the legislature.
	   The revisions, if approved into law, appear to mark a change
from policies that encouraged foreign adoptions. The United States
accounted for more than 2,500 adoptions in 1995 alone.
	   Under the draft law, foreigners wishing to adopt Chinese
children will need their own government's approval, and must submit
health records and proof that they do not have a criminal record,
Xinhua reported.
	   But the new law would relax restrictions on domestic adoptions
``since an increasing number of Chinese families have the economic
means to support more children,'' Xinhua said.
	   By excessively restricting domestic adoptions, the existing law
``prolonged overcrowding in government institutions for orphans and
handicapped minors,'' Xinhua said.
	   ``Welfare institutions are less than ideal places to promote the
healthy growth of unfortunate children because of poor living
conditions and the lack of family warmth,'' it quoted the minister
as saying.
	   The new law will no longer require that Chinese who want to
adopt have no children of their own. It also will remove the
current restriction that lets Chinese only adopt one child, Xinhua
said. The minimum age for prospective parents also will be lowered
to 30 from 35, it said.
	   China's strict family planning policy that limits most families
to one child has led to a rise in abandoned babies, mostly girls.
Families, especially in the countryside, traditionally prefer boys
to carry on the family name and work the land.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The United States has asked to open
security cooperation with Sudan and assured it last week's attack
on a Khartoum factory was aimed at terrorism, not at the Sudanese
government, the country's president said Monday.
	   President Omar Hassan el-Bashir made the comments in his first
news conference since Thursday's strike on a factory that U.S.
officials said manufactured chemical weapons agents but Sudan
insists made only medicines.
	   He said that the U.S. government had communicated with Sudan
through a third party, which he would not name, to say that his
country was ``not targeted in the attack, but terrorism.''
	   ``They also said that they wanted cooperation between the
Sudanese and the American security apparatus, and this happens for
the first time although they have refused a similar request we made
in the past,'' el-Bashir said.
	   Later, in an interview with The Associated Press, el-Bashir said
he was recalling Sudan's ambassador to Britain and would ask the
Foreign Office in London to recall its ambassador from Khartoum.
	   El-Bashir said he was reducing diplomatic representation to the
level of charge d'affaires in response to Britain's support for the
U.S. missile strike.
	   The president earlier called all Sudanese diplomats back from
Washington. On Monday he said American diplomats, who have been
working out of neighboring Kenya and Egypt since 1996, ``will not
be allowed to return to their work in Khartoum.''
	   He added that ambassadors from European countries who supported
the missile strike would be summoned ``to inform them of our strong
protest for their positions.''

Chinese, Japanese legal experts discuss help for war victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Japan has an obligation to apologize and pay
compensation to victims of its military aggression in World War II,
Chinese and Japanese legal experts said in a statement Monday.
	   Lawyers and scholars from the two countries met at a conference
to discussed lawsuits filed in Japan by Chinese victims of wartime
atrocities during Japan's occupation of parts of China before and
during World War II.
	   Among them are Chinese women who were forced into sex slavery
and victims of germ and chemical warfare.
	   China abandoned its right to seek government compensation when
it established diplomatic relations with Japan in 1972. In recent
years the Chinese government has restrained non-government groups
trying to seek compensation for victims.
	   But Japanese lawyers representing the victims in courts in Japan
have been conducting research in China and meeting with their
Chinese counterparts since 1992, the statement said. Monday's
conference was the third held annually between the lawyers and
legal experts from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

Source: British Airways to shift toward smaller long-haul jets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Airways plans to revamp its aircraft fleet
and eventually will emphasize the use of slightly smaller jets on
long-haul routes, a source said Monday.
	   British Airways now flies to dozens of cities all over the world
using Boeing 747 jumbo jets, but will shift more services to
smaller jets such as the Boeing 777, the source said, speaking to
The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
	   The strategy is perhaps new for a European airline, but mirrors
the thinking of former American Airlines boss Robert Crandall, who
stayed away from jumbo jets and flew smaller models such as Boeing
767s on routes such as New York-London.
	   Jumbo jets make enormous profits for airlines when they are full
of passengers, but cost lots of money to operate and can be a
burden when they fly empty during slow seasons.
	   Crandall believed it was better to offer more flights every day
on popular routes, using littler airplanes.
	   By using more and smaller jets, airlines can add or subtract the
number of flights they make to individual cities as demand
warrants. And by offering more flights, the airlines become more
attractive to business travelers, who are more concerned about the
timing of their flight than the price of their ticket.
	   British Airways declined comment on its fleet plans _ at a time
when the carrier is still apparently deciding whether to choose
Boeing or Airbus jets for short-haul routes such as those within
Europe.
	   There have been several reports this summer that British Airways
would for the first time break ranks with Boeing Co., based in
Seattle, by ordering jets directly from Airbus Industrie, the
European plane-making consortium based in Toulouse, France.
	   British Airways has refused to say which way it is leaning on
that order, which it hopes to announce sometime soon.
	   The Wall Street Journal Europe first reported in Monday's
editions that British Airways will shift its long-haul strategy
away from the big jumbo jets.
	   The source who spoke to the AP said the move ``is certainly not
a case of seeing the end of the 747 as we know it.''
	   The big jumbos are still the best way to serve such markets as
London to Australia and parts of Asia, or southern Africa and the
western United States, the source said, adding that those markets,
too, could eventually change and make smaller aircraft the way to
go.

	   WOLFSBURG, Germany (AP) _ Police overpowered and arrested an
armed, unemployed 57-year-old man as he left his in-laws' home with
his two young children after shooting to death two relatives and
wounding several others, authorities said Monday.
	   The man shot and killed his father-in-law and a brother-in-law
Sunday night when they tried to prevent him from entering the
building where his wife was hiding. Another brother-in-law was
wounded.
	   The man's 24-year-old wife was seriously injured jumping from a
fourth-story window.
	   After reaching the apartment, the man then shot and seriously
wounded his mother-in-law and another relative, before leaving with
the children, ages 3 and 1. The 1-year-old was lightly injured,
police said.
	   Prosecutors were preparing murder and attempted murder charges
against the suspect. They said the man had previously been
convicted of weapons charges, and that he illegally possessed the
revolver used in the shooting spree.

Israel increases security at airports following threats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with airport spokesman saying security agents have

 &UR; By DANNY BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOD, Israel (AP) _ Israel is adding security personnel at its
international airport in response to threats by Islamic militants
to attack Israeli and U.S. targets, including airlines, officials
said Monday.
	   Threats against U.S. and Israeli targets emerged after last
week's U.S. air strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan that were aimed at
Osama bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire and Islamic militant linked to
the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa this month.
	   On Sunday, a leading Muslim activist close to bin Laden said
Islamic militants are preparing to retaliate for the air strikes by
targeting U.S. and Israeli strategic sites and airliners.
	   Pini Shis, a spokesman for Israel's Airport Authority, said more
security workers had been added at Ben Gurion International Airport
near Tel Aviv, and that security was also being tightened at
airfields in Eilat and Tel Aviv.
	   ``Since the American activity in Afghanistan and Sudan, security
measures have been increased in Israeli airports,'' Shis told The
Associated Press. He would not specify what other measures had been
taken.
	   Israel radio said cars entering Ben Gurion airport were being
checked more closely and some delays were reported in getting into
the airport.
	   But reporters at the scene said they did not notice longer lines
at the police checkpoints near the airport.
	   An Israeli tour guide who passes through the airport often said
his group did not notice any real differences in security on
Monday. ``Security appears to have been stepped up behind the
scenes if you know where to look,'' said the guide, Ilan Bar.
	   In a related development, the Haaretz daily said that metal
detectors at Ben Gurion do not pick up certain items that contain
metal, including kitchen knives and big key chains.
	   Haaretz tested the five metal detectors in the departure hall
twice and found that the equipment did not pick up on metal items
weighing about 350 grams, or a little over half a pound.
	   Shis said security officials are aware that metal detectors
cannot alert security to every metal object.
	   ``Metal detectors are not the final answer in preventing terror
attacks,'' Shis told The Associated Press. ``The machines are only
one link in an entire chain of security measures.''
	   Shis would not specify which other means are used to check if a
person is carrying weapons.
	   Security measures at Ben Gurion are among the most stringent
worldwide. Motorists are stopped at checkpoints at the airport
entrances, with some passengers _ generally Palestinians _ being
questioned there and having their luggage checked.
	   In the departure lounge, tourists, Palestinians and Israeli Arab
citizens are questioned at length, while Jewish Israelis usually
undergo only a perfunctory check.

Former regional administration chief leads Odessa race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A former regional administration chief is
leading the race for the top municipal post in Odessa, a major
Ukrainian Black Sea port, election officials said Monday.
	   Initial results showed Ruslan Bodelan, an ally of President
Leonid Kuchma, ahead of 32 other contestants with 29.6 percent of
the vote following Sunday's election. His chief rival Oleksiy
Kostusev received 14.4 percent of the vote, the city electoral
commission said.
	   Some 37.5 percent of registered voters cast ballots on Sunday,
it said. Final results were expected Tuesday.
	   The election capped months of violence and political turmoil in
the city, one of Ukraine's major business centers and the site of a
key oil export terminal. The central government wants to use the
port to transport Caspian Sea oil to Europe and long has sought to
increase control over Odessa.
	   In a previous mayoral election last March, incumbent Eduard
Hurvits beat Bodelan, his long-time rival. But Ukraine's Supreme
Court invalidated the election results after a campaign punctuated
by violence.
	   In the current race, the city election commission has refused to
register Hurvits, now a lawmaker in the new Ukrainian parliament,
but did register his rival Bodelan. Government auditors, meanwhile,
have accused Hurvits' former administration of financial
wrongdoing.
	   Hurvits said the low turnout was ``evidence that voters in the
city did not believe that the elections were honest and that their
ballots could matter,'' Odessa's Pivdyen news agency reported.
	   ``There is no doubt that the president of Ukraine has done
everything to secure the victory of one contender _ Ruslan
Bodelan,'' he said.

Tuapse in the Krasnodar region, about 1200 kilometers (750 miles)
south of Moscow.
	   Most suffered fractures and their lives were out of danger,
Russian news reports said, quoting emergency officials.
	   The driver apparently lost control of the bus on a slippery road
under heavy rain. After breaking through a metal barrier, the bus
fell 15 meters (50 feet) down the slope.

U.S. envoy urges Angola to spur peaceful end to Congo fighting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ A U.S. envoy trying to mediate an end to
the fighting in Congo met Monday with Angolan President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos and said the talks were ``very positive and
constructive.''
	   Howard Wolpe, the U.S. special envoy to Africa's Great Lakes
Region, said he and Dos Santos discussed prospects for a peaceful
solution to the insurrection against Congo's President Laurent
Kabila.
	   ``We are looking for a political framework for this to happen,''
Wolpe told reporters before leaving for South Africa where he said
he would continue his efforts.
	   Dos Santos is close to Kabila, having aided his toppling of
President Mobutu Sese Seko last year, and has sent troops and tanks
across Angola's northern border to buttress Congo government forces
against the insurgents.
	   Those Angolan troops drove rebel forces from a string of
Atlantic coast towns in a reversal of rebel gains, a senior
Congolese government advisor said Monday in Kinshasa.
	   Zimbabwe has also sent troops to aid Kabila, while Uganda and
Rwanda have denied reports that they are aiding the rebels. The
involvement of Congo's neighbors in the fighting has sparked fears
of a wider regional conflict.
	   Wolpe said that during his 30-minute meeting with Dos Santos
they discussed withdrawal of foreign troops but he declined to give
details.
	   Wolpe said the U.S. is seeking to ``maintain the regional
integrity'' of Congo and find a solution to the country's internal
problems.

Laos looks to strengthen ties with South America
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Laos is looking to strengthen ties with
South American countries with a trip to Brazil and Argentina by its
foreign minister, the official KPL news agency said Monday.
	   Foreign Minister Somsavat Lengsavad is leading a delegation to
the two countries after attending a meeting of the Non-Aligned
Movement in Durban, South Africa, from Aug. 29 to Sept. 3.
	   Somsavat is the highest ranking official from the Southeast
Asian country ever to visit Latin America.
	   He is scheduled to meet Brazilian and Argentine corporate
leaders after holding talks with government officials.
	   Laos, ruled by a communist government since 1975, joined the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations last year as part of an
effort to end international isolation.
	   The landlocked country of 4.6 million people, following the lead
of close ally Vietnam, shifted from a centrally planned to a more
market-oriented economy about a decade ago.
	   The rigid communist political system remains intact.

Foster's to sell two Chinese breweries as losses mount
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australia's Foster's Brewing Group
Ltd. revealed plans Monday to sell off two of its three breweries
in China amid climbing multi-million dollar losses and an
investment writedown of U.S. dlrs 97 million (Australian dollars
168 million).
	   Foster's said it was involved in talks to divest its Tianjin and
Guangdong breweries, but would keep its biggest plant in Shanghai
as its production center.
	   Foster's president and chief executive officer Ted Kunkel said
three breweries were too expensive to run in China's overcrowded
and intensely competitive market.
	   He said the company hoped it could halve the U.S. dlrs 24
million (Australian dollars 42 million) Asian losses booked in
1997-98 within 12 months of the two brewery sales.
	   Kunkel said Foster's remained committed to China and to its
developing businesses in India and Vietnam.
	   ``The demographics alone overwhelmingly support having a
presence there, with India, Vietnam and China together accounting
for more than half the world's population,'' Kunkel said.
	   The brewery divestment was announced as Foster's unveiled a 78
percent jump in net profit for the 12 months to June 30, 1998, to
U.S. dlrs 260 million (Australian dollars 447 million), up from
U.S. dlrs 145 (Australian dollars 250 million) in 1996/97.

 &UR; Eruption of volcano on tiny Italian island touches off fires &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Firefighters dumping water from helicopters and an
airplane above the tiny volcanic island of Stromboli Monday put out
blazes sparked by a powerful eruption of flaming lava stones.
	   ``The situation is under control, and there's no danger to the
population,'' said Franco Barberi, deputy minister of civil
defense, after taking a helicopter tour of the island, which is 80
kilometers (50 miles) north of Messina, Sicily.
	   Two houses were set afire by the shower of red-hot stones that
came raining halfway down the slope after two strong explosions
from the volcano Saturday evening, RAI state TV reported.
	   Local authorities banned excursions up the slope as well as
boats from getting too close to the part of the island where the
lava was flowing.
	   Stromboli is highly active, and nightly excursions with mountain
guides to the crater's edge to see flames shooting from the top are
a popular activity on the sleepy island with black-lava beaches.
Tourists also pay fishermen to take them out at night just off
shore to see bursts of red fire piercing the black sky.

Kiriyenko: More unpopular measures ahead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo MOSB109 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia may still undertake tough economic measures
even though the government has been replaced for taking unpopular
steps to combat the country's crisis, outgoing Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko said Monday.
	   Kiriyenko has struggled to overcome the economic slump since his
appointment five months ago. He was fired by President Boris
Yeltsin on Sunday, one week after the government gave up its
attempts to support the ruble and effectively devalued the national
currency 34 percent.
	   ``We made our choice, despite realizing that our tough,
unpopular decisions would lead to our dismissals,'' Kiriyenko was
quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   The firings are widely seen as Yeltsin's attempt to shift the
blame for the devaluation.
	   Unpopular measures are likely to continue because the economic
crisis is ``extremely severe,'' Kiriyenko said.
	   Kiriyenko refused to criticize his predecessor Viktor
Chernomyrdin for the latest crisis, which hit Russia as soon as
Kiriyenko took office this spring. A plunge in world oil prices and
the Asian economic crisis have strongly contributed to Russia's
troubles.
	   ``Nothing is more tempting than criticizing the predecessor,''
Kiriyenko told reporters. ``I'm proud I have never succumbed to
that temptation.''
	   Yeltsin had fought hard to push Kiriyenko's appointment through
parliament this spring, arguing strenuously that Russia needed new,
vigorous leadership. Not long after Kiriyenko took office, the
Russian stock market went into a nose dive, beginning an
unremitting series of economic crises.
	   Kiriyenko said his eventual dismissal ``was predictable.''
	   ``What was unpredictable was the time span allotted to my
government,'' he said.

Taiwan Patriot bases battle-ready: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Patriot anti-missile defenses around
Taipei are partially battle-ready following the completion of new
military bases, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   Five bases for the PAC-2 missiles, an upgraded version of the
Patriots used by U.S. forces against Iraqi Scuds during the 1991
Gulf War, have been completed, and two more are still under
construction, the United Daily News said.
	   The missiles are presently at a ``considerable stage'' of battle
readiness, the paper said. It published a photo of a completed base
that it claimed showed two PAC-2 units in place.
	   Taiwan's Defense Ministry would not confirm the report, but said
the publication of sensitive military information was
``regrettable,'' Taiwan Television reported.
	   The Patriots are intended to protect the capital from attack by
Chinese M-series missiles of the type Beijing lobbed into waters
near the island in 1995 and 1996 as part of a campaign of
intimidation aimed at deterring Taiwanese moves for international
recognition.
	   Taiwan is spending over U.S. dlrs 385 million to deploy 200 of
the fourth generation Patriot missiles, and is also adapting
homemade ground to air missiles to shoot down incoming ballistics.
	   Despite spending billions over the past few years to update its
decrepit defense capability with cutting edge weaponry from France
and the United States, Taiwan is still considered highly vulnerable
to a Chinese missile attack.
	   China claims Taiwan as a breakaway province to be reunified with
by force if necessary. The island's Nationalist rulers, who fled
the communist takeover of the mainland in 1949, say they want
eventual reunification, but not on Beijing's terms.

India pushes for terrorism talks at upcoming nonaligned meeting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India will seek a discussion of
international terrorism at the upcoming 113-nation summit of the
Non-Aligned Movement in South Africa, a Foreign Ministry spokesman
said Monday.
	   The bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Zimbabwe heightened
international concern about terrorism. India, which describes
itself as a victim of Pakistan-based terrorism in the northern
Kashmir provitions cannot be identified.
	   At the summit, to be held Aug. 19 through Sept. 3, the
nonaligned countries also were likely to consider requests by Arab
nations for the United Nations to investigate U.S. claims that a
Sudanese pharmaceutical company it destroyed was making chemicals
that could be used in weapons.
	   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was likely to meet his
Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, during the Durban conference,
but it was not clear if they would hold direct talks, the spokesman
said. At their last meeting during a regional summit in Sri Lanka,
the two men failed to agree on how to resume negotiations on
Kashmir.
	   India has been battling an insurgency in the disputed territory
of Kashmir, in which more than 15,000 people have been killed since
1989. New Delhi accuses Pakistan of backing separatist militants,
but Pakistan denies actively aiding the militants.
	   The summit is scheduled before the regular session of the U.N.
General Assembly and will help members reach a consensus on such
issues as economic cooperation among developing countries and
nuclear disarmament.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) - The Arab League on Monday denounced last
week's U.S. military strikes against Sudan as an aggression against
an Arab country and gave strong political backing to the Islamic
government in Khartoum.
	   In a resolution following an emergency meeting of its council,
the 22-member league also urged Washington to refrain from any
further actions ``which may arouse public outrage'' in the Arab
world.
	   ``The council decides to condemn the American attack against the
pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum as an aggression against Sudan
and a grave violation of its sovereignty and its territorial
integrity,'' said the resolution.
	   The council, made up of Arab ambassadors to the league, adopted
the resolution unanimously after a two our debate. Sudan's
ambassador to the league, Ahmed Abdel-Khalim, is the current
rotating chairman, but this is not believed to have affected the
vote.
	   Sudan has asked for the emergency meeting last week to seek Arab
support in its confrontation with the United States over the attack
on a Khartoum factory which Sudan insists makes medicines but
Washington claims produces ingredients for chemical weapons.
	   U.S. officials tied the factory to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi
dissident it blames for the twin bombings on U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7. Thursday attack in Khartoum was
accompanied by strikes on bases for bin Laden in Afghanistan.
	   The league's council also urged ``the United States as a
permanent member of the Security Council and as a superpower to
respect international legitimacy and refrain from these actions
which constitute an aggression against the sovereignty of states.''
	   It also pledged ``material an moral backing to eradicate the
effects of the American strikes and support Sudan in international
organizations.'' Sudan also has urged a meeting of the U.N.
Security Council to discuss the air strikes.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Marine Police rescued 14
illegal Indonesian immigrants in the Straits of Malacca after their
boat sank in rough seas, a news report said Monday.
	   The Indonesians, aged between 6 and 52, are being held at a
police station in Lumut, 280 kilometers (168 miles) north of Kuala
Lumpur, and will be investigated by the Immigration Department,
said police officer Jamaluddin Kudin.
	   Also Monday, the Marine Police rescued a boatload of 19
Indonesians found drifting near Teluk Batik beach near Lumut, after
their fuel ran out.
	   On Friday, a man drowned after a boat filled with at least 20
Indonesian illegal immigrants sank in the Straits of Malacca. A
rescue squad saved 11 survivors from the rough sea near Port Klang,
but eight were still missing.

Taiwan Patriot bases battle-ready: report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS that location of bases not given, 2nd graf

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Patriot anti-missile defenses around
Taipei are partially battle-ready after the completion of new
bases, the United Daily News reported Monday.
	   Five bases for launching the PAC-2 missiles are complete, and
two more are still under construction, the newspaper said, without
identifying specific locations.
	   The missiles, upgraded versions of the Patriots used by U.S.
forces against Iraqi Scuds during the 1991 Gulf War, are presently
at a ``considerable stage'' of battle readiness, the paper said. It
published a photo of a completed base that it claimed showed two
PAC-2 units in place.
	   Taiwan's Defense Ministry would not confirm the report, but said
the publication of sensitive military information was
``regrettable,'' Taiwan Television reported.
	   The Patriots are intended to protect the capital from attack by
Chinese M-series missiles of the type Beijing lobbed into waters
near the island in 1995 and 1996, as part of a campaign of
intimidation aimed at deterring Taiwanese moves towards greater
international recognition.
	   Taiwan is spending over U.S. dlrs 385 million to deploy 200
PAC-2s, and is also adapting homemade ground to air missiles to
shoot down incoming ballistics.
	   Despite spending billions over the past few years to update its
decrepit defense capability with cutting edge weaponry from France
and the United States, Taiwan is still considered highly vulnerable
to a Chinese missile attack.
	   China claims Taiwan as a breakaway province to be reunified with
by force if necessary. The island's Nationalist rulers, who fled
the communist takeover of the mainland in 1949, say they want
eventual reunification, but not on Beijing's terms.

Bangladesh appeals for international help to deal with floods
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo DHA102 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Bangladesh appealed Monday for
international help to deal with a devastating flood that has caused
550 deaths and disrupted the lives and livelihood of 20 million
people.
	   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's cabinet reviewed the flood
situation and asked for assistance to cope with the damage,
estimated at dlrs 220 million, an official said.
	   The government said it lacked food, medicine. Also needed were
funds to reclaim agricultural land, for housing material, to
rebuild and repair schools, for roads and rail tracks, and for
dredging rivers.
	   Since the floods began last month, all the country's rivers
overflowed their banks, submerging 60 percent of the land. Crops,
roads, railways and homes were washed away or destroyed.
	   Some 100,000 people were ill with diarrhea and at least 65 had
died from water borne diseases.
	   Weather experts said the flooding may continue until the middle
of September when the seasonal monsoon rains end.
	   Bangladesh, a delta region, is plagued by floods and other
natural calamities every year which claim many lives and cause
widespread damage to the infrastructure.

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Viktor Chernomyrdin's return as Russian
prime minister could stabilize the Russian economic crisis, the
Polish and Hungarian prime ministers agreed Monday.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin fired Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko on Sunday and brought back Chernomyrdin, who was replaced
by Kiriyenko earlier this year.
	   Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban visited Poland on Monday
to discuss the Russian crisis and impending NATO membership. He met
separately with Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek and President Aleksander
Kwasniewski.
	   Summarizing their talks, Buzek said he and Orban believed
Chernomyrdin would calm Russia's economic turmoil.
	   Chernomyrdin ``has always been regarded as a supporter of
reforms,'' Buzek said.
	   He noted Poland and Hungary now trade mostly with the West
instead of their former Soviet bloc allies and said their economies
``seem to be pretty well prepared for the situation which has
arisen in Russia.''
	   Orban said Hungary would set up a special telephone hot line
with Poland because ``in Poland, there is broader knowledge about
what is going in Russia and what may happen.''
	   Russia last week devalued the ruble and froze debt payments,
prior to the weekend dismissal of the government.
	   The Russian crisis appeared to hurt the Hungarian forint, which
fell to record lows against the U.S. dollar before coming back
Monday. Hungary's central bank said it might intervene to stabilize
the currency.
	   Poland's zloty, which fell from an artificially strong position
last week due to the Russian crisis, strengthened Monday, though
share prices on the Warsaw Stock Exchange fell 1 percent to
14,123.0 points from 14,264.3 points Friday.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Arab League on Monday denounced last
week's U.S. military strikes against Sudan as an aggression against
an Arab country and gave strong political backing to the Islamic
government in Khartoum.
	   In a resolution following an emergency meeting of its council,
the 22-member league also urged Washington to refrain from any
further actions ``which may arouse public outrage'' in the Arab
world.
	   ``The council decides to condemn the American attack against the
pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum as an aggression against Sudan
and a grave violation of its sovereignty and its territorial
integrity,'' said the resolution.
	   The council, made up of Arab ambassadors to the league, adopted
the resolution unanimously after a two-hour debate. Sudan's
ambassador to the league, Ahmed Abdel-Khalim, is the current
rotating chairman.
	   Sudan asked for the emergency meeting last week to seek Arab
support in its confrontation with the United States over the attack
on a Khartoum factory which Sudan insists makes medicines but
Washington claims produces ingredients for chemical weapons.
	   U.S. officials tied the factory to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi
dissident it blames for the Aug. 7 twin bombings on U.S. embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania. The U.S. attack in Khartoum was accompanied
Thursday by strikes on bin Laden's bases in Afghanistan.
	   The league's council also urged ``the United States as a
permanent member of the Security Council and as a superpower to
respect international legitimacy and refrain from these actions
which constitute an aggression against the sovereignty of states.''
	   It also pledged ``material and moral backing to eradicate the
effects of the American strikes and support Sudan in international
organizations.'' Sudan also has urged a meeting of the U.N.
Security Council to discuss the air strikes.

Prosecutors investigate oil leak into Oder river
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Prosecutors opened an investigation Monday
into an oil leak from a factory that caused a five kilometer (three
mile) slick in the Oder river.
	   Three teams of firefighters trained in dealing with toxic
substances were still trying to contain the refined oil that leaked
Sunday from the Rockwool-Polska factory in Cigacice, 430 kilometers
(260 miles) west of Warsaw and 60 kilometers (35 miles) from the
German border.
	   Barbara Baran, deputy head of a regional prosecutor's office,
said the wrong valve was opened on a container of refined oil,
causing the spill of an estimated 20 tons (about 140 barrels or
5,800 gallons).
	   The amount that reached the main stream of the river remained
unknown, she said.
	   ``We must know if someone wanted to do it intentionally,'' Baran
said in a telephone interview.
	   She said about 40 tons (280 barrels or 11,600 gallons) of oil
were unaccounted for, but it was not clear how much of that was
used in production and how much remained in the factory's storm
reservoirs or got into the river.
	   Firefighters so far have retrieved six tons (about 40 barrels or
1,680 gallons) of oil mixed with water from the river and three
tons (about 20 barrels or 840 gallons) of oil from the factory
area, according to Capt. Boguslaw Lewicki, spokesman for the
provincial firefighters' headquarters.
	   Two barriers have been placed down river from the leak to catch
the oil, Lewicki said.

Greece calls for removal of American weapons from northern Cyprus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece Monday said American weapons were
propping up Turkish forces in northern Cyprus and called on the
United States to demand their removal.
	   ``There is no Turkish military entity without American
weapons,'' said Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos.
	   He added that although Greece also depended on U.S. arms,
removing ``illegally deployed'' American weapons from northern
Cyprus would help reduce tension on Cyprus.
	   Greece and Cyprus last week accused Turkey of shipping 50
American-made tanks to the island. Turkey has not officially
commented on the accusation, but military sources denied a
build-up.
	   Pangalos called on the U.S. to ``persuade Turkey to remove
immediately from Cyprus these illegal weapons which were given by
the United States.''
	   Cyprus and Greece say American legislation forbids such
deployments, an apparent reference to a 1988 foreign aid bill that
gave hundreds of millions of dollars to Greece and Turkey. It
included a provision that American weapons purchased with the money
not be transferred to Cyprus.
	   Foreign military aid to Greece and Turkey was phased out this
year.
	   But American-made Greek weapons have also been on the island,
with four F-16 jets visiting Cyprus in June.
	   Turkey fears Russian-made S-300 missiles which Cyprus plans to
deploy will be used to protect Greek jet fighters at a newly-built
air base, shifting the balance of forces on the island. Ankara has
warned it will prevent their deployment, an action Athens says will
mean war.
	   Pangalos defended Cyprus' decision to deploy the missiles in
November, claiming they will reduce tension by balancing out
forces.
	   Cyprus has been divided into Greek- and Turkish-speaking sectors
since Turkey invaded its northern third in 1974 following a failed
Athens-backed coup. Turkey keeps about 35,000 troops in the north.
	   U.S.-led efforts to defuse the crisis have led nowhere and a
proposal for a no-fly zone over Cyprus was rejected by Turkey last
week.

Vietnamese president arrives in Moscow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Vietnam is eager to expand economic ties with
Russia, Vietnamese President Tran Duc Luong said Monday as he began
a visit that will include the creation of a joint oil-refining
venture.
	   Luong and Russian President Boris Yeltsin plan to discuss
bilateral relations and international problems on Tuesday. The two
nations are also expected to sign agreements on legal assistance
and bank settlements during Luong's visit, which is scheduled to
run through Saturday.
	   Russia and Vietnam also plan to sign an agreement creating a
joint oil-refining venture in central Vietnam, the ITAR-Tass and
Interfax news agencies reported.
	   The dlrs 1.3 billion project is expected to take two to three
years to complete, Interfax said. The plant would be capable of
refining 6.5 tons of oil a year, it said.
	   Luong is also scheduled to lay a wreath at a monument to Ho Chi
Minh and visit the Russian Academy of Sciences, where he will be
made an honorary professor. He also plans to visit Russia's
second-largest city and imperial capital, St. Petersburg, Interfax
said.
	   This is the first visit by a Vietnamese president to Moscow
since the 1991 Soviet collapse.

Split confident despite first round draw
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Even though his team was held to a surprising draw
in the first leg, Hadjuk Split striker Mate Baturina has no doubt
the Croatian side will beat Malmo in Sweden Tuesday and advance to
the first round of the UEFA Cup.
	   Split, stunned by a 1-1 tie at home two weeks ago to Malmo, was
highly favored to win the second-round qualifying series after
eliminating the Swedish club at the same stage in last year's
tournament.
	   ``We are better than Malmo and I have no doubts that we'll
defeat them,'' Baturina said Monday.
	   Hajduk is coming off a 2-2 tie with Cibalia in the Croatian
league, while Malmo suffered a 4-0 defeat to Elsborg in the Swedish
league over the weekend.
	   Osijek coach Milan Djuricic rested key players from a vital
local derby match in Croatia this weekend in a bid to beat
Anderlecht and advance in the European competition.
	   Osijek holds a 3-1 lead over the Belgians going into the
return-leg match at Brussels.
	   Osijek captain Stjepan Vranjes said any Anderlecht attack would
be met with a fierce counter attack.
	   ``We'll have to play as we played in Osijek _ aggressively...
courageously,'' he said. ``We shouldn't allow ourselves to be
afraid and defend for the whole 90 minutes. That could be fatal for
us.''
	   Rapid Vienna will have to overcome a 3-1 deficit when it takes
on Omonia of Cyprus at home.
	   Omonia striker Costas Malekos, a goalscorer in the first-leg
encounter, said his team was not going to become over-confident
because the Austrians were playing for national pride.
	   Glasgow Rangers coach Dick Advocaat has closely studied
Arsenal's losing UEFA Cup campaign against PAOK Salonika last
season as he prepares for an away clash against the Greek side.
	   Rangers has a 2-0 lead after the first leg at Ibrox but the
players have been warned that playing in Salonika, on a ground
known as ``The Tomb,' will be a real test of character.
	   PAOK was banned from European competition for two years in 1994
when fans rioted during a game against Paris St. Germain.
	   Arsenal, the FA Cup and League double titlist last season, lost
1-0 in Salonika and then tied 1-1 at home to go out of the UEFA
Cup.
	   Rangers go into the match fresh from a 3-1 win over Kilmarnock
in the Scottish Premier Division.
	   Salonica's Ukrainian coach Oleg Blachin's main concern is his
team's form after a 1-0 defeat to Ionikos Nikea in the opening
round of the Greek first division Sunday.
	   ``I'm not a magician to change things overnight. But if we are
also undisciplined with Rangers, then forget about Europe,''
Blachin said.
	   Kilmarnock must claw back a 2-0 deficit against Sigma Olomouc in
its return match at Rugby Park to continue in the European
tournament.
	   The Scots struggled in hot conditions in the Czech Republic in
the first leg two weeks ago.
	   Two Turkish teams will be playing second leg UEFA Cup qualifying
matches Tuesday.
	   Istanbulspor, scheduled to play Romanian team Arges-Dacia
Pitesti, has moved its match to Thursday due to a clash of venue
with fellow Turkish side Fenerbahce.
	   Feberbahce will play IFK Goteborg Tuesday and goes into the
match trailing 2-1 after the first leg.
	   Trabzonspor will be launching an all-out attack Tuesday as it
attempts to overcome Wilsa Krakow's 5-1 lead.
	   Trabzonspor manager Gordon Milne said his team had nothing to
lose as it was already four goals down to the Polish side and was
playing without star striker Abdullah Ercan, who was sent off in
the first-leg match.
	   Wisla Krakow coach Franciszek Smuda said his team showed
defensive lapses in its 2-1 Polish league win over Lech over the
weekend but he was confident the problems would be rectified
against Trabzonzpor.
	   Smuda said his players would encounter hot conditions and a
hostile crowd but were focused on scoring the first goal and
winning the match.
	   Red Star travels to Russia to defend a 2-1 lead over Rotor
Volgograd after the first-leg match at Belgrade.
	   Red Star coach Milorad Kosoanovic said he expected the
Yugoslavians to be at an advantage despite playing away in

Summer forest fires caused dlrs 70 million in damage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Damages from summer wildfires that
ravaged forests and vineyards along Croatia's southern coastline
are estimated at dlrs 70 million, national forest officials said
Monday.
	   The fires burned down roughly 13,000 hectare (32,500 acres) of
mostly pine forests, fields and vineyards. Worst hit was the island
of Korcula, but other islands and areas around the country's
southern tourist center of Dubrovnik were also badly scorched,
state-run news agency HINA reported Monday.
	   Dozens of homes were also razed and two people killed in the
more than 200 fires that swept the south of the country in early
August.
	   Ivan Tolic, an official at the state Croatian Forests
institution, told HINA that about half of the forests damaged were
state-owned and their recovery will be financed by the government.
	   Owners of the privately-owned forests will have to cover their
damages themselves, Tolic said.
	   Olive and wine growers on Korcula, whose crops provided a
substantial source of income, have already appealed to the
government for help.
	   One German tourist was recently fined for igniting a fire on
Zlarin Island, however, police said most of the fires were sparked
by natural causes.

Taliban claim battlefield victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ The Taliban religious militia that
controls most of Afghanistan claimed another battlefield victory
Monday in a northern town, but the report could not be
independently confirmed.
	   Taliban fighters captured the town of Kiyan in northern Baghlan
province, a Taliban source claimed in the Pakistani border city of
Peshawar. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The militants have pushed their northern-based opposition into a
small corner of the country. A series of recent victories earlier
this month includes the seizure of Mazar-e-Sharif, the largest city
in the north.
	   Now they are trying to gain control of a north-south highway
through Baghlan that links Mazar-e-Sharif to Kabul, the capital,
which they seized two years ago.
	   The Taliban have been shaken by a U.S. missile attack last week
on alleged terrorist training camps near the city of Khost in
southern Afghanistan.
	   Washington said it had evidence the camps were run by Osama bin
Laden, an exiled Saudi militant who is Washington's No. 1 suspect
in the Aug. 7 bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa that
killed a total of 257 people, 12 of them Americans.

New Japan economic policy council seeks to steer clear of
</HEADLINE>
bureaucracy

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The head of Japan's new economic policy council
pledged Monday to tackle problems such as the troubled banking
system without relying on prescriptions drawn up by the country's
powerful bureaucracy.
	   ``It's up to us whether we want to use the ideas of the
bureaucrats,'' said Hirotaro Higuchi, chairman of Asahi Breweries
Ltd. and head of the Economic Strategy Council, after the group's
first meeting convened.
	   The special advisory task force, dominated by leading academics
and business leaders, was set up last week by Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi.
	   The council, a ten-member Japanese version of the United States'
Council of Economic Advisers, will work to come up with a set of
policy recommendations for jump-starting Japan's stagnant economy
as soon as December, Higuchi said.
	   Those appointed to the group include Hiroshi Okuda, president of
Toyota Motor Corp. and Motoshige Ito, a professor at the
prestigious Tokyo University.
	   Bureaucrats are represented in the council's secretariat, which
includes officials from the Bank of Japan, Finance Ministry and
Economic Planning Agency.
	   Among the issues discussed Monday were the accuracy of Japan's
economic statistics, steps for ailing small and medium-size firms
and urban land policy reforms.

Dehydrated Suu Kyi ends standoff; students hold protest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reported tensions between crowd, police, 10th
graf; NLD members warned in meeting, 18th graf

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Students risked their first street
protest against Myanmar's military regime in nearly two years
Monday, while Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi bowed to failing
health and ended a 13-day roadside standoff with the government.
	   Suu Kyi's political party, the National League for Democracy,
had urged her to come home from a bridge 32 kilometers (19 miles)
outside Yangon, where her van had been stopped since Aug. 12.
	   Suu Kyi's doctors said she was suffering from kidney and urinary
tract problems, low blood pressure and dizziness when they last
were allowed to see her Friday. Government officials said she
returned to the capital of her own free will in their care.
	   Tin Oo, an NLD vice chairman, reported that the doctors told Suu
Kyi on Monday she was suffering from dehydration and possible
hypoglycemic shock. She was persuaded to voluntarily return.
	   ``Her health hasn't improved,'' Tin Oo said. ``The jaundice
hasn't improved. She's suffering from dehydration. They were
worried she might be suffering from hypoglycemia.''
	   Earlier in Yangon, some 200 students, watched by about 400
bystanders, staged the first anti-government protest since December
1996. It appeared to catch authorities by surprise and lasted an
hour before riot police arrived.
	   Blocking traffic at Hledan Junction near Yangon University, they
waved red flags with a yellow fighting peacock, the symbol of the
democracy movement and Suu Kyi's party.
	   ``Down with the totalitarian government!'' they chanted. ``Our
cause must succeed!''
	   They ran down side streets as soon as the first truckload of
riot police appeared. Police chased them, but government officials
said later that none had been arrested. The intersection was closed
to traffic.
	   Tensions were later reported between a crowd of local residents
north of the intersection and police, but could not be confirmed.
	   A government spokesman, on condition of anonymity, said that
most of the students were NLD sympathizers and said that Suu Kyi's
vehicle visited the protest site on the way back from the bridge,
hours after the demonstration ended.
	   The protest was the most open act of public discontent this
month, which has marked the 10th anniversary of a national uprising
against military rule that was eventually crushed by the army and
in which as many as 3,000 people died.
	   Anti-government groups _ including 18 foreign activists who were
deported after a week in detention for distributing leaflets _ have
been stepping up their activities and renewing demands for an end
to military rule.
	   The protesters distributed pamphlets signed by the Yangon
Students Union. Student unions have been illegal in Myanmar, also
known as Burma, since the military seized power in 1962.
	   The last street protests in Myanmar took place in December 1996
and were organized by students demanding more civil rights. The
government closed the universities to quell the protests. They
remain shut.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, whose movements are tightly restricted, made a
fourth attempt Aug. 12 to drive to the western city of Bassein to
meet party members. As in previous attempts, she was stopped at a
checkpoint and not allowed to proceed.
	   The ruling State Peace and Development Council has asserted that
she risked assassination. The organization accused of plotting her
death, the Karen National Union, an ethnic insurgent group that
supports Suu Kyi, called the claims ``a calumny.''
	   Meanwhile, Home Minister Col. Tin Hlaing met two members of the
NLD's central executive committee. He had sought a meeting with
party Chairman Aung Shwe, who sent the lower-level members instead.
	   State-run television showed the meeting, which included Brig.
Gen. Kyaw Win, deputy military intelligence chief, and said that
the NLD members were told ``to avoid any action that would disrupt
peace and stability.''
	   Such meetings are extremely rare. Previous attempts at
furthering discussions have foundered on the party's insistence _
echoed by the international community _ that the military reverse
its refusal to include Suu Kyi.
	   Suu Kyi had set a deadline of last Friday for the government to
convene the parliament elected in 1990, in which the NLD won 82
percent of the seats. The military refused to honor the vote.
	   The deadline passed without action. The party then said it would
call the parliament without permission, an action that the
government said Monday would be illegal and sink hopes of further
talks.

Decision on German Holocaust Memorial delayed till after elections

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Worried that the ``sensitive subject'' of
Germany's planned Holocaust Memorial was being distorted by
politics, Chancellor Helmut Kohl agreed Monday to put off a final
decision on the project until after national elections next month.
	   The delay, announced by Mayor Eberhard Diepgen, raises more
doubt about whether the 10-year-old project will ever get off the
drawing board. Kohl's challenger, Social Democrat Gerhard
Schroeder, has expressed skepticism about the plans and said he
would reopen a nationwide debate if he wins the Sept. 27 national
election.
	   The project has already gone through two artistic competitions
and three symposiums with international experts. The field was
narrowed to four finalists last year, but a winner has yet to be
announced.
	   Construction was supposed to begin in Berlin next year, when the
federal government starts its move from Bonn back to its historic
capital.
	   But this summer, Schroeder's pick as cultural adviser told
interviewers he found the memorial idea too cold and grandiose. He
suggested the memory of the Holocaust would be better preserved for
future generations by spending more on upkeep at decaying
concentration camps or on a research center.
	   His comments were later echoed by Schroeder and other critics,
including Diepgen.
	   Kohl, one of the memorial's strongest backers, had been pressing
Diepgen, a fellow Christian Democrat, to bring the memorial project
to a vote at a city government meeting Tuesday.
	   But after talking Monday, they decided that ``it would be
irresponsible to allow the decision over the erection of a Memorial
for the Murdered Jews of Europe to become a campaign issue,'' said
city government spokesman Michael-Andreas Butz.
	   ``Unfortunately, the necessary atmosphere of objectivity for a
sensitive subject like this is not there at the present time,'' he
said.
	   Kohl has already donated a large plot federal land in the heart
of Berlin for the project, and hoped to announce the winning design
before the Sept. 27 parliamentary election.
	   The 15 million mark (dlrs 8.3 million) memorial is a joint
project of the federal and city government and a private
initiative, all of whom have to sign off on the final plans.
	   Kohl and the private backers have already indicated they favor a
design by U.S. architect Peter Eisenmann, a labyrinth of 2,500
pillars resembling a cemetery.
	   Diepgen, though, has said he found all the proposals too
``monumental'' and thought the chosen site southeast of the
Brandenburg Gate was wrong as well. He also has said he does not
want Berlin to become a ``city of mourning,'' with one memorial
after another.
	   Other critics, like Schroeder's intended culture czar, Michael
Naumann, question whether a crime as sweeping as the Holocaust can
be effectively expressed in any work of art.
	   Journalist Lea Rosh, who first proposed the memorial in 1988,
attacked critics in a bitter essay published Monday in the Berliner
Zeitung.
	   ``I thought until now that we would at least regret the murder
of six million people,'' she wrote. ``Does a current politician
want, does he dare, to simply slink away from it?''

Colonial and Cold War past fuels anti-West anger in Congo

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Rich but exploited, independent but
dogged by its colonial past, suspicions ignited by war in the Congo
have unleashed a seething hostility aimed at the West.
	   French diplomats have been expelled and student protesters march
on France's embassy. Americans fearing violence in the capital made
a hasty retreat more than a week ago.
	   ``It is important that any foreigner who arouses suspicion
should be expelled,'' Information Minister Didier Mumengi said of
the French diplomats.
	   Battling a rebel army in the east and west that President
Laurent Kabila calls an invasion by Rwanda and Uganda, Kinshasa's
population is increasingly convinced of Western complicity in the
war.
	   State-controlled media feed public anger with reports that
Washington and Paris are in league with Rwanda and the rebels are
trying to destabilize, divide and re-colonize the country.
	   Suspicion and anger directed at the West has clear roots in this
vast central African country's turbulent past.
	   ``You need to see where we have been to understand why this is
happening today,'' says Munsoko Wabombe, a professor of sociology
at Kinshasa University. ``The Congo has been a pawn in geopolitics,
it has been robbed of its natural wealth.''
	   Colonial ruler Belgium and later European and American
businesses have long exploited Congo first for its ivory and now
its abundant stores of precious stones, cobalt, copper and other
minerals.
	   Both economically and politically, from diamonds to military
bases, this strategic country has been a treasure trove for the
West. For the Congolese, it remains a country of squalid poverty.
	   ``When you look at us you think we are poor and pathetic thieves
and beggars,'' says Fidel Ngaiaba, a self-employed shoe cobbler.
``But you Europeans have been robbing us of our riches forever.''
	   The idea that the United States and France have for decades
thrust meddling hands into the Congo is nurtured by Kabila's
government, Wabombe said.
	   For most of his 32 years in power, U.S.-backed despot Mobutu
Sese Seko ran roughshod over the country. Kabila ousted Mobutu last
year.
	   An American and French ally against Soviet influence in Africa,
Mobutu was supported for his politics and ignored, if not forgiven,
for his human rights abuses, dictatorial rule and ``kleptocracy''
that deprived the people of revenues from lucrative foreign mining
contracts.
	   The Kamina military camp, a former U.S. base in Congo's southern
Katanga province, is evidence of the past close military links
between Mobutu and the United States.
	   Also, French forces more than once intervened to help Mobutu
during revolts and secessionist movements. French soldiers now
deployed in neighboring Brazzaville _ for the evacuation of foreign
residents from Kinshasa _ have raised eyebrows.
	   Angry student groups jeer westerners in Kinshasa. Shouting,
waving fists and spitting, they say France and the United States
are to blame for their problems.
	   ``You have knowledge of how to do things, but you don't share it
with us,'' says Jean-Rene Basele, a waiter. ``You just use us.''
	   Kabila has seized on reports that the United States has military
personnel in neighboring Rwanda. The U.S. forces are there on an
unrelated military training mission, but local media has
interpreted the link as Pentagon support for the Rwandan-backed
rebels in Congo.
	   ``The West's affairs with Mobutu are remembered here,'' says
Wabombe.

More middle-aged women are smoking, WHO reports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ An increasing number of middle-aged women
are smoking, which could boost heart attack rates, officials from
the World Health Organization said at a conference Monday.
	   Preliminary results of a decade-long study conducted in 38
countries and presented at the European Congress of Cardiology show
a growing number of women smokers between ages 35 and 64.
	   In many parts of the world, particularly Asia and Russia, the
number of women who smoke has risen by 10 percent to 20 percent,
said Dr. Kurt Huber, a Vienna cardiologist. More specific overall
figures were not immediately available.
	   ``Nobody has the answer'' as to why more women are smoking,
Huber said.
	   In many industrialized countries, fewer people are suffering
heart attacks and more people with heart disease are living longer,
thanks to improved medical care.
	   As living standards improve in less developed countries, people
are gaining weight and smoking more _ two factors known to
contribute to heart disease. But medical care hasn't reached
Western levels, Huber said.
	   In those countries, more educational programs are needed to
explain the dangers of smoking and provide advice on how to kick
the habit. ``I think this is the first step to reduce this risk
factor,'' Huber said.

Thousands of Romanian miners protest layoffs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Almost 28,000 miners in Romania went
on a one-day strike Monday to protest layoffs and unpaid salaries
and what they called the government's failure to reform the mining
system, national radio reported.
	   ``We want to keep our jobs,'' said Nicolae Jegau, a leader of
coal miners in Jiu Valley in southwestern Romania, which has 45,000
miners. Speaking on national radio, he appealed to the government
to intervene in the crisis.
	   Miners are demanding immediate negotiations with the government.
They said they will go on indefinite strike if their demands are
not met.
	   In June, the government ordered 108 mines to be closed down as
part of its economic reforms. The closures would jeopardize 110,000
miners' jobs.
	   The government did not immediately comment about the strike.
	   Coal, copper, lignite and metal miners took to the streets in
the towns of Motru, Rovinari and Hunedoara to underscore their
claims, radio reported.
	   Tens of state companies have not paid their debts to the
national electricity company, Renel, which has said it will cut off
their energy. As a result, Renel has not had the money to pay the
mines. Mines have not paid salaries on time.
	   Last summer, the center-right reform government began a massive
program of layoffs. Almost 100,000 miners have been laid off since
September 1997 in a scheme in which the government gives each miner
up to 20 months' salaries.
	   Initially, miners were happy to accept payoffs, but now seem to
be realizing their lives have not improved. Miners' leaders said
that most of the miners have spent this money and only 10,000 have
found new jobs.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Pakistan's foreign minister visiting Uzbekistan,
new grafs 4-6. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Top officials from four former Soviet republics in
Central Asia have agreed to coordinate efforts to defend their
countries against the influence of the Taliban Islamic army in
nearby Afghanistan, a news agency reported Monday.
	   The defense and foreign ministers from Uzbekistan, Kazakstan,
Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan met in the Uzbek capital of Tashkent on
Saturday to discuss ``possible scenarios, measures, and assistance,
including military assistance,'' among the Central Asian states,
Tajik Ambassador to Uzbekistan Tadzhitdin Mardonov told the
Interfax news agency.
	   The leaders also debated how to combat Islamic extremism and
``forces that cover themselves with Islamic slogans,'' Mardonov
said.
	   Later on Monday, Pakistan's Foreign Minister Mohammed Siddique
Kanju also arrived in Uzbekistan for a two-day visit, as part of
his tour of Central Asia, Interfax reported.
	   Pakistan is widely believed to be the force behind the Taliban
movement, but both Pakistan and the Taliban have denied such
accusations.
	   Kanju is expected to meet with his Uzbek counterpart Abdulazizi
Kamilov to discuss the situation in Afghanistan and surrounding
regions, the report said, citing Pakistani embassy officials.
	   Russia and the former Soviet republics in Central Asia fear an
influx of refugees and weapons across their borders from
Afghanistan, and possibly a spillover of fighting.

El-Bashir: Clinton guilty of `ugly crime' in missile strike

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's president said Monday that if the
United States truly believed a Khartoum factory made chemical
weapons, it committed ``an ugly crime'' by bombing it in the midst
of a city and endangering thousands of lives.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, President Omar Hassan
el-Bashir argued this was evidence U.S. officials knew the Khartoum
plant made only medicines _ as Sudan maintains.
	   El-Bashir also said he was recalling Sudan's ambassador to
Britain and would ask London to withdraw its ambassador in response
to Britain's support for the U.S. missile strike on the factory
Thursday night.
	   The president last week called back all Sudanese diplomats from
Washington. On Monday he said American diplomats, who have been
working out of neighboring Kenya and Egypt since 1996, ``will not
be allowed to return to their work in Khartoum.''
	   He added that ambassadors from European countries that supported
the missile strike would be summoned ``to inform them of our strong
protest for their positions.''
	   At least a half-dozen missiles struck the Al-Shifa
Pharmaceutical Industries Co. factory in North Khartoum on
Thursday, largely destroying it.
	   President Clinton tied the factory to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi
dissident blamed for the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania on Aug. 7 that killed 257 people. A second U.S. attack was
carried out Thursday against bin Laden's bases in Afghanistan.
	   U.S. officials said the factory made precursors for the deadly
VX chemical. Sudan insists that it made only pharmaceuticals and
supplied half the nation's needs.
	   In the interview, el-Bashir argued that U.S. officials ``know
that Sudan has no capabilities to manufacture chemical weapons.''
	   But he added that if Americans really believed the factory made
chemical weapons, then bombing it would have released deadly poison
into the air and put at risk the thousands of Sudanese people who
live around it.
	   ``Then this is a crime, an ugly crime,'' el-Bashir added.
	   He accused Clinton of being ``a war criminal of the first
degree'' for the strike.
	   At a news conference earlier in the day, el-Bashir repeated an
invitation to have a U.N. fact-finding mission inspect the factory.
	   He also told reporters that the United States has asked to open
security cooperation with Sudan and assured it through a third
party that his government was ``not targeted in the attack, but
terrorism.''
	   ``They also said that they wanted cooperation between the
Sudanese and the American security apparatus, and this happens for
the first time, although they have refused a similar request we
made in the past,'' el-Bashir said.
	   He would not name the third party who communicated the U.S.
positions. American officials have said nothing publicly about
opening a channel with Sudan.
	   The United States accuses Sudan of being a terrorist-sponsoring
state, but did not directly accuse it of being tied to the targeted
factory.
	   El-Bashir insisted that bin Laden ``has no shares at all in the
factory,'' adding bin Laden left Sudan before the factory was
opened in 1996. Bin Laden lived in Sudan in the early 1990s but was
forced out under Western pressure in 1995.
	   He also said the attack was carried out ``to cover up for the
Monica scandal,'' a reference to the grand jury investigation into
Clinton's relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.

Council discussions expected on Sudan's request for technical team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.S. deputy ambassador said Monday
that it was unnecessary to investigate U.S. claims that the
Sudanese pharmaceutical factory it bombed was a chemical plant
linked to terrorist groups.
	   ``We don't see any point to it,'' Peter Burleigh said Monday,
three days after Sudan asked the council to send a U.N. technical
team to investigate. Burleigh didn't elaborate.
	   Sudan's letter, sent Friday to council president Danilo Turk of
Slovenia, also requested an urgent meeting. The 15-member council
could discuss the matter Monday, said officials from the United
Nations and Slovenia.
	   The Organization of Islamic Conference and the Arab Group of
states sent Turk letters backing Sudan's requests.
	   On Thursday, the United States launched a cruise missile attack
on the Khartoum plant, and a simultaneous strike against extremist
camps in Afghanistan, in retaliation for the Aug. 7 bombings of
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Washington says the El Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co. plant
and the Afghanistan camps were linked to Osama bin Laden, whom U.S.
officials suspect in the embassy blasts.
	   The pharmaceutical plant produced half of the country's
medicines and vaccines, according to Sudan, including antibiotics
and drugs for diseases like malaria and tuberculosis. Washington
says the plant also produced an ingredient for the deadly nerve gas
VX.
	   China's deputy ambassador, Shen Guofang, said China wanted
evidence that the plant was indeed used for developing chemical
agents.
	   ``We understand their position, and we hope that the United
States will give some strong evidence to prove that this factory
produced some poison gas for terrorism,'' he said.
	   In its letter to Turk, Sudan asked the council to ``take its
responsibility under the Charter of the United Nations by
condemning this barbarous and iniquitous aggression and holding the
United States of America responsible for all the material damage
and human casualties of this aggression.''
	   It called the U.S. strikes a ``clear and blatant violation of
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a member state.''

Arafat will rally support for statehood at U.N. General Assembly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will use the
U.N. General Assembly in September to win international support for
plans to declare a Palestinian state in May 1999, a senior
Palestinian negotiator said Monday.
	   The Palestinian Authority has already begun such contacts,
seeking pledges of recognition once a state is declared in parts of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip on May 4, 1999, said Palestinian
Planning Minister Nabil Shaath.
	   ``The most important contacts will be in September in the
meeting of the General Assembly,'' Shaath said.
	   During his trip to the United States, Arafat will also meet with
U.S. President Bill Clinton, Shaath said.
	   Under the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements, the period of
Palestinian autonomy ends May 4, 1999. The accords stipulated that
by then, Israel and the Palestinians should have negotiated a
permanent peace accord which would, among other things, determine
the final status of the West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem.
	   However, the negotiations have not even begun, and it is
unlikely they will in the near future.
	   Arafat said he would declare statehood by the deadline,
regardless of whether a peace agreement with Israel has been
reached. Israel says this would constitute a violation of the
accords and hinted that in retaliation for a unilateral declaration
of statehood, it might annex parts of the West Bank.
	   The United States has tried to discourage Arafat from going
ahead with a unilateral declaration of statehood.
	   However, the Palestinians are determined to go ahead, Shaath
said. ``Even if we have control over 1 percent of the land, we will
declare the state.''
	   ``What we want is international recognition that our sovereignty
is on all land occupied in 1967,'' Shaath said, referring to the
1967 Mideast war in which Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and
east Jerusalem.
	   Palestinians have full control over 3 percent and partial
control over 24 percent of the West Bank and Gaza.

 &UR; Taiwan pilots walkout over pay cuts

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Protesting pay cuts of up to 40 percent,
67 pilots working for Taiwan's TransAsia Airways handed in their
resignations en masse Monday.
	   The pilots, all assigned to French-Italian ATR42 and ATR72
turboprops on the airline's domestic routes, said they were also
protesting what they called the unwarranted firings of four of
their colleagues.
	   Taiwan's crowded domestic airline market was rocked by a sudden
drop in passenger levels following a pair of fatal air crashes and
other accidents earlier this year. Few airlines are considered to
be profitable, and the government has strongly sought to encourage
consolidation in the industry.
	   TransAsia employs about 245 pilots to fly 48 planes of all
types.

More middle-aged women are smoking, WHO reports

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING BC-Austria-Women Smokers to broaden slug &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ An increasing number of middle-aged women
are smoking, which could boost heart attack rates, officials from
the World Health Organization said at a conference Monday.
	   Preliminary results of a decade-long study conducted in 38
countries and presented at the European Congress of Cardiology show
a growing number of female smokers between ages 35 and 64.
	   In many parts of the world, particularly Asia and Russia, the
number of women who smoke has risen by 10 percent to 20 percent,
said Dr. Kurt Huber, a Vienna cardiologist. More specific overall
figures were not immediately available.
	   ``Nobody has the answer'' as to why more women are smoking,
Huber said.
	   In many industrialized countries, fewer people are suffering
heart attacks and more people with heart disease are living longer,
thanks to improved medical care.
	   As living standards improve in less developed countries, people
are gaining weight and smoking more _ two factors known to
contribute to heart disease. But medical care hasn't reached
Western levels, Huber said.
	   In those countries, more educational programs are needed to
explain the dangers of smoking and provide advice on how to kick
the habit. ``I think this is the first step to reduce this risk
factor,'' Huber said.

Yeltsin on government firings: Russia needed a `heavyweight' at the

 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS and UPDATES thruout with reaction on street, from
analyst, Chernomyrdin telling parliament to set aside austerity
plan. CHANGES byline. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ While Russians wondered aloud whether their
government was out of control, President Boris Yeltsin said Monday
he had reinstated his old prime minister because the country needed
a ``heavyweight'' at the helm.
	   Yeltsin also hinted that he expected Viktor Chernomyrdin, back
on top as acting prime minister, to be Russia's next president. But
a Kremlin spokesman refused to rule out the possibility that
Yeltsin would run again.
	   ``You ask the president,'' Sergei Yastrzhembsky said at a news
conference when asked if Yeltsin was bowing out.
	   Yeltsin dismissed his entire government on Sunday, including
young Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, and called back his old
subordinate, Chernomyrdin.
	   Chernomyrdin began his new stint as premier by holding out an
olive branch to parliament _ but one that might be regarded as
something closer to a bouquet of poison ivy to international
investors.
	   Chernomyrdin asked the State Duma, the lower house of
parliament, to set aside a package of economic austerity measures
demanded by international lenders. He said they ``do not play a
decisive role for financial stabilization,'' the ITAR-Tass news
agency said.
	   Russians appear to be growing increasingly tired of the chaos in
the Kremlin, where scarcely a month passes without Yeltsin firing a
high-ranking official. The entire government has been dismissed
twice this year.
	   ``Our country has everything but a brain,'' grumbled Alexander
Yumka, the manager of a Moscow construction company, in a typical
street-level assessment.
	   ``I personally feel ashamed,'' said Galina Velikzhanena, a
retiree pushing a baby stroller through a park. ``Our leaders can't
even put two words together. They can't even speak the language
grammatically.''
	   Yeltsin went on national television to explain, slowly and
glumly, the decisions he had announced in a terse statement on
Sunday. While he praised the ousted prime minister, the 36-year-old
Kiriyenko, he said the situation in the country demanded more
experienced hands at the wheel.
	   ``Today we need those whom we call heavyweights,'' he said. ``I
consider Chernomyrdin's experience and weight essential.''
	   The 60-year-old Chernomyrdin, a physically large man who
resembles Germany's Helmut Kohl, was ousted in March in favor of
Kiriyenko. At the time, Yeltsin said the country needed ``fresh
ideas and unorthodox approaches'' to tackle its deepening problems.
	   But Kiriyenko spent his five months in office trying to plug
leaks in a crumbling ceiling that finally came crashing down last
week, when he was forced to effectively devalue the national
currency, the ruble. If he had fresh ideas, he never had a chance
to implement them.
	   ``When you have a fire in your house, you don't think about how
to rebuild it, you just try to save it,'' said Yevgeny Volk, a
political analyst with the Heritage Foundation in Moscow. He added
that he considered the appointment of Chernomyrdin to be
``cosmetic.''
	   ``Unfortunately, the roots of the Russian financial problems are
too deep, and remain in the nature of the unreformed economy. ... I
don't expect a rapid improvement,'' he said.
	   Yastrzhembsky, Yeltsin's spokesman, agreed that the appointment
did not represent a change in direction.
	   ``The overall economic course will be unchanged and will aim at
developing a market economy, but there will be serious
transformations in terms of carrying out concrete policies,'' he
told reporters.
	   Chernomyrdin has not yet said what he intends to do. ``The first
thing I will do as acting head of government is to analyze the
situation on Russia's financial and stock markets,'' Chernomyrdin
was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   He faces a disastrous economic situation, in which the ruble's
value is sinking, Russia's banks are teetering on the brink of
collapse and foreign investors are fleeing the stock and money
markets in droves.
	   The ruble dropped 0.135 against the U.S. dollar on the interbank
currency exchange on Monday, to close sharply down at 7.14 rubles
to the dollar.
	   Stocks rallied, however, closing up 6.3 percent in light
trading. Gazprom, the national gas monopoly that Chernomyrdin used
to head, soared 24 percent.
	   While Chernomyrdin has, in the past, inspired some confidence in
Western governments and investors, he never undertook the tough
measures they thought were necessary to reform the Russian economy.
These include collecting taxes from the rich ``oligarchs'' who
support him politically and cutting government spending.
	   Yeltsin's statements about Chernomyrdin are sure to set off a
fresh round of political speculation.
	   The president said he was acting, in part, ``to ensure
continuity of the government in the year 2000. Viktor Stepanovich's
main advantages are decency, honesty, and thoroughness. I think
these qualities will be the decisive argument in the presidential
elections.''
	   Although it sounded like an endorsement, few people believe
Yeltsin has given up on the idea of running for another term
himself. And, given Yeltsin's popularity, which rarely rises above
5 percent in polls, an endorsement from Yeltsin could well be the
political kiss of death.

U.N. experts: Taliban should be refused diplomatic recognition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Governments should refuse diplomatic recognition
to Afghanistan's Taliban rulers and firms should avoid doing
business with them until the regime ends its discriminatory
treatment of women, a U.N. panel of experts has said.
	   The Taliban's policies toward women in areas of the country
under its control are a ``flagrant violation of the principles of
Islam and international law,'' members of the Sub-Commission on the
Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities said.
	   The sub-commission, which has been meeting in Geneva this month,
voted on Friday to urge religious leaders and scholars in
Afghanistan to give the plight of women special attention.
	   The Taliban religious army has come under heavy international
criticism after imposing its strict version of Islamic law when it
took over the Afghan capital Kabul in September 1996.
	   Within days of the takeover, the Taliban stopped women working,
closed schools for girls and made it mandatory for women to wear
the all enveloping burqa.
	   Women are prevented from traveling without a male relative.
Strict Taliban followers say street level windows should be painted
black to protect women from prying eyes.
	   Sub-commission members said in their resolution adopted by
consensus that they were dismayed by the Taliban's claim that Islam
supports their policies concerning women. They urged it to bring
its policies into line with the ``true spirit of Islam and human
rights law.''

Arafat will rally support for statehood at United Nations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will use the
U.N. General Assembly in September to win international support for
plans to declare a Palestinian state in May 1999, a senior
Palestinian negotiator said Monday.
	   The Palestinian Authority has already begun such contacts,
seeking pledges of recognition once a state is declared in parts of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip on May 4, 1999, said Palestinian
Planning Minister Nabil Shaath.
	   ``The most important contacts will be in September in the
meeting of the General Assembly,'' Shaath said.
	   During his trip to the United States, Arafat will also meet with
U.S. President Bill Clinton, Shaath said.
	   Under the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements, the period of
Palestinian autonomy ends May 4, 1999. The accords stipulated that
by then, Israel and the Palestinians should have negotiated a
permanent peace accord which would, among other things, determine
the final status of the West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem.
	   However, the negotiations have not even begun, and it is
unlikely they will in the near future.
	   Arafat said he would declare statehood by the deadline,
regardless of whether a peace agreement with Israel has been
reached. Israel says this would constitute a violation of the
accords and hinted that in retaliation for a unilateral declaration
of statehood, it might annex parts of the West Bank.
	   The United States has tried to discourage Arafat from going
ahead with a unilateral declaration of statehood.
	   However, the Palestinians are determined to go ahead, Shaath
said. ``Even if we have control over 1 percent of the land, we will
declare the state.''
	   ``What we want is international recognition that our sovereignty
is on all land occupied in 1967,'' Shaath said, referring to the
1967 Mideast war in which Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and
east Jerusalem.
	   Palestinians have full control over 3 percent and partial
control over 24 percent of the West Bank and Gaza.

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Seeking to shed his country's
pariah past, Nigeria's new military ruler met Monday with President
Nelson Mandela to pledge closer ties that will benefit Africa.
	   Nigeria's Abdulsalam Abubakar arrived Sunday in Pretoria for his
first high-profile trip abroad since assuming power in June.
	   Abubakar's predecessor, Gen. Sani Abacha, died of a heart attack
in June, ending five years of brutal rule and defiance of world
condemnation for usurping democratic elections.
	   Abubakar welcomed Mandela's support for his efforts to return
Africa's most populous country of 105 million to civilian rule.
	   ``I hope, come May 29, 1999, we will hand over to an elected
government,'' Abubakar told Mandela and reporters.
	   Mandela said he expected the two countries to become closer,
especially after the elections.
	   ``It is important for us to renew our relationship because those
ties can only be in the interest of the continent of Africa,''
Mandela said.
	   Abubakar's three-day visit will include a speech before
Parliament on Tuesday and a visit to Robben Island near Cape Town,
where Mandela was jailed for most of 27 years under apartheid rule.
	   In 1995, Mandela's envoys tried to prevent the executions of
nine Nigerian opposition activists, including Ogoni playwright Ken
Saro-Wiwa.
	   When Abacha's regime hanged them anyway, an angry Mandela called
for immediate sanctions by the Commonwealth and Western powers.
	   The Commonwealth suspended Nigeria that same year over the
executions and said expulsion would follow if it had not made
demonstrable progress toward civilian rule and improved human
rights.

Did Yeltsin name his successor?

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ It sounded like an endorsement when President
Boris Yeltsin on Monday described Viktor Chernomyrdin, ousted and
reinstated as Russia's premier, as a potential presidential
candidate in 2000.
	   But as his senior aide reminded reporters, Yeltsin's warm words
about Chernomyrdin having the right stuff didn't mean that Yeltsin
himself had decided not to run.
	   The statements, coming just hours apart, provided the latest
example of a long series of conflicting signals from the Kremlin
about Yeltsin's possible bid for a third term.
	   Yeltsin told a television audience on Monday that his decision
to bring Chernomyrdin back to power was to a large extent motivated
by the need to ``ensure continuity of the government in the year
2000.''
	   ``Viktor Stepanovich's main advantages are decency, honesty, and
thoroughness. I think these qualities will be the decisive argument
in the presidential elections,'' he said.
	   When asked whether the statement meant the president had decided
not to run again, his spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky hedged.
	   ``You ask the president,'' he said at a news conference.
	   In the past, Yeltsin himself has repeatedly denied the
possibility of running again, but Yastrzhembsky and other aides
always insist the president has never said the final ``no.''
	   Yeltsin's uncertain health and a constitutional limit of two
terms would appear to rule out another bid, but aides occasionally
hint that the 67-year-old leader might run again anyway.
	   They claim that Yeltsin's first term began during Soviet times
and should not count toward the two-term limit. Russia's
Constitutional Court is expected to rule on the issue later this
year.
	   The Kremlin has also insisted that Yeltsin has fully recovered
after a November 1996 heart bypass surgery and is in good health.
The Communist-led opposition in the Russian parliament denies that
claim, saying the president is physically unable to govern.
	   There have been voices of dissent even inside the Kremlin. Igor
Shabdurasulov, Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff, said in an
interview last month that the president had trouble maintaining a
full-time work schedule due to poor health, and that he should not
even think about running for a third term.
	   Many political observers say that Yeltsin is likely to cling to
power as long as he can and was jealously watching the hopefuls as
his own popularity sank.
	   In fact, Chernomyrdin's ouster in March was widely seen as
motivated by Yeltsin's annoyance about the premier's growing
political ambitions.
	   When he was asked last month whether he hopes to be the next
Russian president, Chernomyrdin answered in just two words.
	   ``I will,'' he said.
	   Other potential candidates include Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov,
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, who came in second in the
1996 election, and former national security chief Gen. Alexander
Lebed.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain announced Monday that it has joined with
the United States in agreeing to allow two Libyans charged in the
1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland to be tried by a
Scottish court in the Netherlands.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook urged Libya to cooperate
``quickly and without equivocation,'' and asked U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan to inform Libya of the agreement and seek
arrangements for the transfer of the two men accused.
	   Abdel Basset Ali Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, described as
Libyan intelligence officers, would be tried by a panel of Scottish
judges under Scottish law at The Hague.
	   ``If the accused are innocent, they have nothing to fear from
Scottish justice,'' Cook said. ``While our preference is a Scottish
trial in Scotland, equally we have nothing to fear from conducting
a Scottish trial in a third country.''
	   Cook said that if the two accused were handed over quickly,
Britain would support action in the U.N. Security Council to
immediately suspend sanctions against Libya.
	   ``If Libya should refuse, international support for sanctions
will be redoubled,'' he said.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan is lodging a complaint with
the U.N. Security Council after confirming that a U.S. missile
aimed at neighboring Afghanistan landed by mistake on its
territory, the Foreign Ministry said Monday.
	   The discovery over the weekend of an unexploded missile
supported Pakistan's presumption that the United States violated
its airspace to attack a neighbor, the ministry statement said.
	   Pakistan's representative to the United Nations has been
instructed to take up the matter with the Security Council,
according to the statement.
	   Local officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
missile was found in a remote area Sunday and handed over to the
military the same day, four days after U.S. missiles struck a
suspected militant training camp in neighboring Afghanistan. They
said the missile fell in Kharan, some 600 kilometers (375 miles)
south of the U.S. target near Khost, Afghanistan.
	   No injuries or damage was reported.
	   ``The government of Pakistan had informed us about this and we
are looking into it,'' U.S. Embassy spokesman Richard Hoagland
said.
	   The government earlier had to retract a similar report that a
U.S. missile fired at Afghanistan had landed in Pakistan and killed
several people. Pakistan fired its intelligence chief, Manzoor
Ahmed, for passing on the false report to the prime minister.
	   The United States fired 73 Tomahawk missiles at six targets in a
camp in eastern Afghanistan linked to Saudi dissident Osama bin
Laden. Bin Laden is accused of directing worldwide terror attacks
from Afghanistan, including the Aug. 7 bombings of two U.S.
embassies in East Africa that killed a total of 257 people.
	   Pakistan has condemned the United States for its missile
strikes, but its criticism has been fairly muted. While standing by
fellow Muslim countries and describing angry anti-American protests
by its citizens as justified, Pakistan has also strongly condemned
terrorism.
	   The United States is Pakistan's longtime ally and important
donor. The Taliban religious militia that rules most of Afghanistan
is also Pakistan's ally, but its reputation for harboring
terrorists has presented problems for its friends.

Germany talks up military option for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany on Monday sought to step up
pressure on Yugoslavia to stop the fighting in Kosovo, saying it
would consider military intervention in the province even without
U.N. approval.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government also called on Germany's
European Union partners to agree to a catalog of sanctions on
Yugoslavia, including a ban on Yugoslav commercial flights,
freezing the assets of banks and companies, and visa restrictions.
	   The statements came after Kohl's Cabinet discussed the Kosovo
crisis Monday. They suggested Germany is losing hope that Russia
will drop its objections to a U.N. military mission in Kosovo.
	   ``If the situation worsens, military intervention may become
necessary,'' Kohl's spokesman Otto Hauser. If the U.N. Security
Council blocks it, other options could be studied, he said.
	   He apparently meant the possibility of NATO action.
	   ``The German government is extremely concerned about the
escalation of violence in Kosovo, especially from the Yugoslav
side,'' Kohl's spokesman Otto Hauser said.
	   He warned of a looming ``humanitarian catastrophe'' and a wave
of refugees into western Europe it would trigger. Germany wants to
avoid becoming a refugee haven as it did during the Bosnian war,
Hauser said.

Cummunist Party offers to freeze opposition to Japan-US security

ties &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Japan Communist Party is prepared to suspend
its demand that the Japan-U.S. security treaty be scrapped and join
a coalition of opposition parties aiming to topple the government,
says party chairman Tetsuzo Fuwa.
	   Fuwa's announcement marks a major policy turnaround for the
Communist party and his comments were carried in an an interview to
be published Tuesday in the official Communist Party newspaper,
Shimbun Akahata.
	   Fuwa proposed the Communist Party ``suspend problems involving
the Japan-U.S. security treaty'' in order to seek an ``interim''
coalition government aimed at breaking the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party's grip on power.
	   The Associated Press received and advance copy of the interview
on Monday.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's ruling Liberal Democratic Party
suffered a major setback in upper house elections in July and
maintains power only by virtue of its majority in the more powerful
lower house.
	   Many opposition parties have been urging a united front to block
key LDP proposals in Parliament's upper house and force early
general elections.
	   The communists' longstanding call for the termination of the
Japan-U.S. security pact _ the agreement that outlines the two
countries' military ties _ has been a central party policy. The
demand is seen as radical in Japan and an impediment to the party
joining other opposition parties against the ruling party.
	   Fuwa was quoted as saying that while his party would refrain
from working to scrap the treaty it would maintain its policy of
voting against bills for implementing the proposed Japan-U.S.
defense cooperation guidelines.
	   Japan has promised to implement the guidelines which outline
when, and to what extent, it would cooperate with the United States
during military conflicts in Asia.

 &UR; Decision of Ionian Bank tender postponed following surprise bids &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ One Greek and two foreign banking groups
submitted bids Monday for the purchase of a 51 percent stake of
Ionian Bank, Greece's fourth-largest bank.
	   But a decision on the sale was postponed until at least Tuesday
in order for the government to investigate the credibility of the
two top bidders.
	   Ionian is the largest bank to be privatized and a key element in
the socialist government's effort to meet targets for participation
in the European Union's single currency by 2001.
	   The highest bid was submitted by U.S. law firm Jan Morton Heger
representing an unknown American consortium offering dlrs 1.12
billion.
	   An Italian-American holding company called Exchange Finance
Overseas offered dlrs 1 billion. No other details on the identity
of the bidders was immediately available.
	   ``We must examine the solvency of the candidates and then we
will announce our decision as soon as possible, probably tomorrow
(Tuesday),'' said National Economy and Finance Minister Yannos
Papantoniou.
	   Greek billionaire Spyros Latsis' Eurobank group, one of the
favorites for purchasing Ionian, submitted a bid far below the
bank's current stock market value of 250 billion drachmas (dlrs 825
million).
	   According to local media, Eurobank offered 135.6 billion
drachmas (dlrs 447 million) for Ionian, despite statements by
Papantoniou that he would annul the tender if offers fell below
Ionian's stock market value.
	   Greece's Alpha Credit Bank, which had been considered a certain
bidder along with Eurobank, did not submit an offer.
	   Papantoniou did not rule out the possibility of the tender being
annulled, telling journalists that in this case, ``it will be
repeated within a logical period of time.'' He did not provide any
further details.
	   The government's plans to privatize Ionian prompted violent
reactions from the bank's staff in May, leading to a six-week
strike by employees seeking to maintain benefits and the guarantee
of a job until the retirement age of 62.

El-Bashir: Clinton guilty of `ugly crime' in missile strike

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's president said Monday that if the
United States truly believed a Khartoum factory made chemical
weapons, it committed ``an ugly crime'' by bombing it in the midst
of a city and endangering thousands of lives.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, President Omar Hassan
el-Bashir argued this was evidence U.S. officials knew the Khartoum
plant made only medicines _ as Sudan maintains.
	   El-Bashir also said he was recalling Sudan's ambassador to
Britain and would ask London to withdraw its ambassador in response
to Britain's support for the U.S. missile strike on the factory
Thursday night.
	   The president last week called back all Sudanese diplomats from
Washington. On Monday he said American diplomats, who have been
working out of neighboring Kenya and Egypt since 1996, ``will not
be allowed to return to their work in Khartoum.''
	   He added that ambassadors from European countries that supported
the missile strike would be summoned ``to inform them of our strong
protest for their positions.''
	   At least a half-dozen missiles struck the Al-Shifa
Pharmaceutical Industries Co. factory in North Khartoum on
Thursday, largely destroying it.
	   President Clinton tied the factory to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi
dissident blamed for the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania on Aug. 7 that killed 257 people. A second U.S. attack was
carried out Thursday against bin Laden's bases in Afghanistan.
	   U.S. officials said the factory made precursors for the deadly
VX chemical. Sudan insists that it made only pharmaceuticals and
supplied half the nation's needs.
	   In the interview, el-Bashir argued that U.S. officials ``know
that Sudan has no capabilities to manufacture chemical weapons.''
	   But he added that if Americans really believed the factory made
chemical weapons, then bombing it would have released deadly poison
into the air and put at risk the thousands of Sudanese people who
live around it.
	   ``Then this is a crime, an ugly crime,'' el-Bashir added.
	   He accused Clinton of being ``a war criminal of the first
degree'' for the strike.
	   El-Bashir said, however, that he would consider resuming
relations with the United States if it ``compensates all those who
were harmed in the factory attack and it publicly apologizes.''
	   He added that he expected the owners of the factory to file
lawsuits against Washington, but did not say where or suggest a
figure for damages. One factory manager put the loss at dlrs 100
million.
	   At a news conference earlier in the day, el-Bashir repeated an
invitation to have a U.N. fact-finding mission inspect the factory.
	   He also told reporters that the United States has asked to open
security cooperation with Sudan and assured it through a third
party that his government was ``not targeted in the attack, but
terrorism.''
	   ``They also said that they wanted cooperation between the
Sudanese and the American security apparatus, and this happens for
the first time, although they have refused a similar request we
made in the past,'' el-Bashir said.
	   He would not name the third party who communicated the U.S.
positions. American officials have said nothing publicly about
opening a channel with Sudan.
	   The United States accuses Sudan of being a terrorist-sponsoring
state, but did not directly accuse it of being tied to the targeted
factory.
	   El-Bashir insisted that bin Laden ``has no shares at all in the
factory,'' adding bin Laden left Sudan before the factory was
opened in 1996. Bin Laden lived in Sudan in the early 1990s but was
forced out under Western pressure in 1995.
	   He also said the attack was carried out ``to cover up for the
Monica scandal,'' a reference to the grand jury investigation into
Clinton's relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.

Nine ethnic Albanian students sentenced to prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Nine ethnic Albanian students were
sentenced to prison after being found guilty of working for the
secession of Kosovo from Serbia and Yugoslavia, an ethnic Albanian
human rights group reported.
	   The Board for Protection of Human Rights and Freedoms said the
students received prison terms ranging from one year to seven and a
half years. The students included three young women, who each were
sentenced to two-year terms.
	   The sentencing occurred in the southern Kosovo town of Prizren,
some 60 kilometers (37 miles) southwest of Pristina, where the nine
were ethnic Albanian student leaders.
	   There was no immediate confirmation of the sentencing from Serb
sources in Kosovo. Hundreds of ethnic Albanians have been sentenced
on similar charges.
	   Most of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority want independence from
Serbia and Yugoslavia. A militant separatist group and government
forces are fighting over the control of the province.
	   The nine students were arrested earlier this year in a Serb
police raid in Prizren.

Cross controversy exposes rift in Polish leadership

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek's government
asked President Aleksander Kwasniewski on Monday if he made any
deals with Jewish groups involving crosses near the Auschwitz World
War II death camp.
	   While phrased in diplomatic language, the question appeared
intended to raise suspicion about the former communist president's
role in the escalating dispute.
	   A presidential aide said later that all correspondence between
Kwasniewski and Jewish groups was turned over to the government.
The aide said the letters encouraged dialogue but made no promises.
	   Conservative Catholics have placed scores of crosses next to a
larger papal cross in a field that borders Auschwitz to try to
prevent the papal cross from being removed, as demanded by Jewish
groups.
	   The papal cross, erected almost a decade ago, was used in a 1979
Mass celebrated at nearby Birkenau death camp by Polish-born Pope
John Paul II. It commemorates the 152 Poles killed by Nazis in 141
on the site.
	   Jewish groups oppose any crosses near Auschwitz, particularly
the papal cross, which can be seen from inside the camp. They say
the cross disturbs the memory of the more than 1 million Jews
killed at Auschwitz and Birkenau.
	   Kwasniewski hosted talks last year with Jewish groups that
reached agreement on a dlrs 93.5 million preservation plan for the
Auschwitz-Birkenau complex.
	   But the Jewish groups refused to sign the deal this year,
complaining about the cross. That prompted conservative Catholics
inspired by religious activist Kazimierz Switon to set up more
crosses at the site.
	   More than 50 new crosses were erected Sunday, bringing the total
to well over 100.
	   Government spokesman Jaroslaw Sellin said Monday the government
needed to know what Kwasniewski had told Jewish groups to avoid any
discrepancies over Poland's stance on the issue.
	   ``We want to know if any arrangements were made with the
Presidential Chancellery,'' Sellin said. ``This way we will avoid
differences between agreements made with the president and our own
postulates.''
	   He repeated that Buzek's government supported keeping the papal
cross at the site but removing all the other ones set up their in
the past month. That also is the position of Poland's powerful
Catholic church.
	   Buzek and Cardinal Jozef Glemp, the nation's top church leader,
met Monday to discuss the cross controversy before Catholic bishops
hold a two-day conference on several issues, including the crosses.
	   The bishops' conference was unlikely to alter the church's
position on the crosses, extending the dispute with Jewish
organizations and delaying any decisions on further steps to
preserve the Auschwitz-Birkenau complex.
	   Buzek's rightist coalition government has been weakened by
defections over other issues in recent months that reduced its
majority in the 460-seat Sejm, or lower house of parliament, to 17.
Some of the defectors were conservative Catholics, and further
defections over the cross issue could erase the coalition's
majority.

	   LOD, Israel (AP) _ Israel is adding security personnel at its
international airport in response to threats by Islamic militants
to attack Israeli and U.S. targets, including airlines, officials
said Monday.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's senior adviser, David
Bar-Illan, said Israel would use all measures it deemed necessary
to fight terrorism.
	   Asked whether this included pre-emptive strikes, Bar-Illan told
The Associated Press: ``I don't want to be specific about anything

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ With a fallen missile as proof,
Pakistan is going to the U.N. Security Council to accuse the United
States of violating its airspace when Washington struck neighboring
Afghanistan.
	   The government earlier had had to retract a report that one of
the missiles in the barrage on alleged terrorist training camps in
Afghanistan last week landed accidentally in Pakistan and killed
several people. But the discovery over the weekend of an unexploded
missile that did no damage supported Pakistan's presumption that
the United States violated its airspace to attack a neighbor,
according to a Foreign Ministry statement Monday.
	   Pakistan's representative to the United Nations was instructed
to take up the matter with the Security Council, the ministry said.
	   Pakistan has condemned the United States for its missile strikes
on Afghanistan and on Sudan the same night, but its criticism has
been fairly muted. While standing by fellow Muslim countries and
describing angry anti-American protests by its citizens as
justified, Islamabad has also strongly condemned terrorism.
	   The United States is Pakistan's longtime ally and important
donor. The Taliban religious militia that rules most of Afghanistan
is also Pakistan's ally, but its reputation as a harborer of
terrorism has presented problems for its friends.
	   Among those killed and injured in the U.S. attacks on
Afghanistan were Pakistanis training to join a Muslim separatist
war in neighboring India. India has long accused the Pakistani
government of fomenting the insurrection in Indian-held Kashmir, a
charge Islamabad denies. Pakistan and predominately Hindu India
have fought two wars over the Himalayan territory of Kashmir, which
is now divided between them.
	   Local officials in western Pakistan who spoke on condition of
anonymity said the U.S. missile was found in a remote area Sunday
and handed over to the military the same day, four days after U.S.
missiles struck a suspected militant training camp in neighboring
Afghanistan. They said the missile fell in Kharan, some 600
kilometers (375 miles) south of the U.S. target near Khost,
Afghanistan.
	   ``The government of Pakistan had informed us about this and we
are looking into it,'' U.S. Embassy spokesman Richard Hoagland
said.
	   Pakistan fired its intelligence chief, Manzoor Ahmed, for
passing on to the prime minister the false report that Pakistanis
had been killed by a missile in Pakistan to the prime minister.
	   The United States fired 73 Tomahawk missiles at six targets in a
camp in eastern Afghanistan linked to Saudi dissident Osama bin
Laden. Bin Laden is accused of directing worldwide terror attacks
from Afghanistan, including the Aug. 7 bombings of two U.S.
embassies in East Africa that killed a total of 257 people.
	   The 18-foot (5-meter) Tomahawk is capable of carrying up to
1,000 pounds (450 kilograms) of explosives.
	   The attack on a neighboring, fellow-Muslim country has prompted
daily anti-American protests around Pakistan. On Monday, about 200
Afghan refugee schoolgirls led by their veiled teachers chanted
``Destroy America!'' in a peaceful march in the Pakistani border
city of Peshawar, which has seen the largest and most violent
protests.
	   Also Monday, an Italian military plane picked up the body of a
U.N. military observer killed by unknown gunmen in Afghanistan a
day after the attacks. An international honor guard of other
military observers escorted the coffin, draped in a blue U.N. flag,
onto the plane in the Pakistani capital.
	   Most foreign workers for the U.N. mission to Afghanistan and
other groups have left Afghanistan, where anti-Western
demonstrations have been held in several cities since the attack.
	   On Monday, the U.S. State Department warned Americans against
traveling to Afghanistan, citing reaction to the missile attack and
continued civil war fighting in Afghanistan.
	   There have been no American diplomats in Afghanistan since the
United States closed down its embassy there in 1989. All Americans
with the United Nations also were evacuated from Afghanistan on the
advice of the U.S. State Department after the Africa bombings.

Report on Nazi gold conference notes Vatican failure to open
</HEADLINE>
archives &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Nazi Gold-Box &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The final report on a 41-nation conference that
tried to unravel the jigsaw of looted Nazi gold called Monday for
greater openness of historical records _ and pointedly noted that
the Vatican has not responded to calls to open its World War II
archives.
	   Lord Mackay, the conference chairman, also announced that a fund
launched at the December meeting to compensate victims of Nazi
persecution has pledges of dlrs 57 million from 11 countries, and
promises of additional funds from other nations.
	   At the London conference, participants agreed to seek moral and
financial restitution for the victims of Nazi persecution.
	   The United States set an end-of-the-century deadline for
completing investigations into the atrocities and distributing cash
to Holocaust survivors, many nearing the end of their lives.
	   ``I think all present were agreed that the international
community must look urgently and imaginatively for ways to bring
relief to such people,'' Mackay wrote in the 834-page final report
published Monday.
	   ``The strong feeling of our conference was that we must all do
our utmost to get there by the end of the present century,'' he
wrote.
	   Mackay said there had been progress since the conference,
including the dlrs 1.25 billion Holocaust settlement by
Switzerland's two biggest commercial banks, and noted that a Swiss
government fund was helping victims ``wherever they may be,
principally in former Eastern Europe.''
	   Noting that 16 nations have set up commissions to investigate
their countries' roles in the Nazi era, Lord Janner, chairman of
The Holocaust Educational Trust, said: ``It is in no small part due
to the international determination symbolized by the London
conference that some measure of justice is starting to be done.''
	   At a news conference launching the report, Mackay said one of
the conference's key themes was the need to open government and
private archives so information can be made available to those
researching the history of gold looted by the Nazis.
	   ``We still do not know precisely how much gold the Nazis
stole,'' he said, citing estimates ranging from dlrs 650 million to
dlrs 7 billion.
	   Mackay announced that the archives of the Tripartite Gold
Commission, created by the Allies after the war to distribute
looted Nazi gold, will be opened after its operations are wound up.
	   ``I understand that this is expected to take place within the
next few weeks,'' he said.
	   The conference report, which includes papers tracing the history
of Nazi gold from 31 countries, three banks, four organizations and
the Tripartite Commission, ``is an important step to encouraging
just that,'' Mackay said.
	   During the closed conference meetings, there were a number of
calls for the Vatican to open its Nazi-era and post-war archives.
But the two-member Vatican delegation, which switched from
participant to observer status before the conference began, sat
mute.
	   Several days after the conference ended, the Vatican denied
allegations by the World Jewish Congress that it had received gold
looted from Gypsy concentration camp victims, and stood by its
refusal to open archives covering the Nazi period.
	   In his final conclusions, Mackay singled out the Vatican's
failure to respond to calls to open its archives.
	   Asked whether he was saying there was a need for openness from
the Vatican, he replied: ``You may wish to say that. There's a
general need for openness.''

Colonial and Cold War past fuels anti-West anger in Congo

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Rich but exploited, independent but
dogged by its colonial past, a wary and embattled Congo is seething
with hostility aimed at the West.
	   French diplomats have been expelled and student protesters march
on France's embassy. Americans fearing violence in the capital made
a hasty retreat more than a week ago.
	   ``It is important that any foreigner who arouses suspicion
should be expelled,'' Information Minister Didier Mumengi said of
the French diplomats.
	   Battling a rebel army in the east and west that President
Laurent Kabila calls an invasion by Rwanda and Uganda, Kinshasa's
population is increasingly convinced of Western complicity in the
war.
	   State-controlled media feed public anger with reports that
Washington and Paris are in league with Rwanda and the rebels are
trying to destabilize, divide and re-colonize the country.
	   Suspicion and anger directed at the West has clear roots in this
vast central African country's turbulent past.
	   ``You need to see where we have been to understand why this is
happening today,'' says Munsoko Wabombe, a professor of sociology
at Kinshasa University. ``The Congo has been a pawn in
geo-politics, it has been robbed of its natural wealth.''
	   Colonial ruler Belgium and later European and American
businesses have long exploited Congo first for its ivory and now
its abundant stores of precious stones, cobalt, copper and other
minerals.
	   Both economically and politically, from diamonds to military
bases, this strategic country has been a treasure trove for the
West. For the Congolese, it remains a country of squalid poverty.
	   ``When you look at us you think we are poor and pathetic thieves
and beggars,'' says Fidel Ngaiaba, a self-employed shoe cobbler.
``But you Europeans have been robbing us of our riches forever.''
	   The idea that the United States and France have for decades
thrust meddling hands into the Congo is nurtured by Kabila's
government, Wabombe said.
	   For most of his 32 years in power, U.S.-backed despot Mobutu
Sese Seko ran roughshod over the country. Kabila ousted Mobutu last
year.
	   An American and French ally against Soviet influence in Africa,
Mobutu was supported for his politics and ignored, if not forgiven,
for his human rights abuses, dictatorial rule and ``kleptocracy''
that deprived the people of revenues from lucrative foreign mining
contracts.
	   The Kamina airfield in Congo's southern Katanga province, once a
covert CIA transit point to supply Angola's UNITA rebels, reflects
the past close military links between Mobutu's Zaire and the United
States.

Decision on German Holocaust Memorial delayed till after elections

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Worried that the ``sensitive subject'' of
Germany's planned Holocaust Memorial was being distorted by
politics, Chancellor Helmut Kohl agreed Monday to put off a final
decision on the project until after national elections next month.
	   The delay, announced by Mayor Eberhard Diepgen, raises more
doubt about whether the 10-year-old project will ever get off the
drawing board. Kohl's challenger, Social Democrat Gerhard
Schroeder, has expressed skepticism about the plans and said he
would reopen a nationwide debate if he wins the Sept. 27 national
election.
	   The project has already gone through two artistic competitions
and three symposiums with international experts. The field was
narrowed to four finalists last year, but a winner has yet to be
announced.
	   Construction was supposed to begin in Berlin next year, when the
federal government starts its move from Bonn back to its historic
capital.
	   But this summer, Schroeder's pick as cultural adviser told
interviewers he found the memorial idea too cold and grandiose. He
suggested the memory of the Holocaust would be better preserved for
future generations by spending more on upkeep at decaying
concentration camps or on a research center.
	   His comments were later echoed by Schroeder and other critics,
including Diepgen.
	   Kohl, one of the memorial's strongest backers, had been pressing
Diepgen, a fellow Christian Democrat, to bring the memorial project
to a vote at a city government meeting Tuesday.
	   But after talking Monday, they decided that ``it would be
irresponsible to allow the decision over the erection of a Memorial
for the Murdered Jews of Europe to become a campaign issue,'' said
city government spokesman Michael-Andreas Butz.
	   ``Unfortunately, the necessary atmosphere of objectivity for a
sensitive subject like this is not there at the present time,'' he
said.
	   Kohl has already donated a large plot federal land in the heart
of Berlin for the project, and hoped to announce the winning design
before the Sept. 27 parliamentary election.
	   The 15 million mark (dlrs 8.3 million) memorial is a joint
project of the federal and city government and a private
initiative, all of whom have to sign off on the final plans.
	   Kohl and the private backers have already indicated they favor a
design by U.S. architect Peter Eisenmann, a labyrinth of 2,500
pillars resembling a cemetery.
	   Diepgen, though, has said he found all the proposals too
``monumental'' and thought the chosen site southeast of the
Brandenburg Gate was wrong as well. He also has said he does not
want Berlin to become a ``city of mourning,'' with one memorial
after another.
	   Other critics, like Schroeder's intended culture czar, Michael
Naumann, question whether a crime as sweeping as the Holocaust can
be effectively expressed in any work of art.
	   Michel Friedman, board member of the Central Council of Jews in
Germany, said he regretted the latest delay and blamed Schroeder
and Diepgen for ``this undignified drawing out of the decision.''
	   Journalist Lea Rosh, who first proposed the memorial in 1988,
attacked critics in a bitter essay published Monday in the Berliner
Zeitung.
	   ``I thought until now that we would at least regret the murder
of six million people,'' she wrote. ``Does a current politician
want, does he dare, to simply slink away from it?''

Degussa shares down after U.S. lawsuit filed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Shares of Degussa AG were 4.5 percent
down Monday, the first trading session after a lawsuit targeting
the German chemicals, precious-metals and pharmaceuticals group and
its U.S. unit, Degussa Corp., was filed in New Jersey.
	   The class-action suit charges that Degussa willingly helped the
Nazi regime to manufacture gas used for death-camp executions and
to process gold seized from Holocaust victims. It seeks all of the
group's assets, which totaled about 3.8 billion marks (dlrs 2.1
billion) at the end of the 1997 fiscal year.
	   Although the overall Frankfurt stock market was up slightly,
Degussa shares were down 4.30 marks (dlrs 2.40) on the day at 91.50
marks (dlrs 50.83) in electronic trading Monday afternoon.
	   Degussa on Monday declined to comment on the lawsuit. A
spokeswoman said the company hadn't received official notice of the
legal action.

Omagh quietly tries to return to normal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The shopkeepers returned,
businesses opened and hundreds of people milled quietly down Market
Street on Monday, as Omagh attempted to restore some feeling of
normality in the wake of Northern Ireland's deadliest terrorist act
in three decades.
	   But despite urgings from the town's Chamber of Commerce for
retailers to reopen their shops, the memory of the Real IRA's Aug.
15 car bomb was still too fresh for most residents _ leaving the
mood somber and trading quiet.
	   Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Tony Blair prepared to meet
again with his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern on Tuesday to discuss
security issues.
	   Since the bombing, which killed 28 people and injured 330, the
Irish government has announced plans to recall its Parliament to
pass ``draconian'' anti-terrorist legislation.
	   Blair said he would announce Tuesday whether he would recall the
British Parliament to pass new legislation.
	   The Real IRA, the dissident group that claimed responsibility
for the Omagh bomb, has since apologized for the deaths and
suspended its terrorist activities.
	   The scene of the blast remained closed off by a huge metal fence
Monday, but most stores capable of opening were trading, among them
Watterson's Drapers, which lost three shop assistants in the blast.
	   Lawrence Rush, whose wife Libby, 57, died in her Pine Emporium
shop, said the shop openings showed the resilience of the people of
Omagh.
	   ``They have shown the bombers `What have you gained from this?
You have gained death and heartache in Omagh but we're still
staying and what you're doing is completely useless and obscene,'
'' he said.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo rejected a proposed cease-fire on
Monday as its allied forces captured former rebel strongholds in
the country's west and opposing Ugandan troops were seen deploying
in the northeast.
	   What began three weeks ago as an armed rebellion against
President Laurent Kabila has now drawn three of Congo's neighboring
countries _ Rwanda and Uganda for the rebels and Angola for the
government _ into the conflict. Nearby Zimbabwe has also sent
troops to shore up government defenses.
	   Although Uganda and Rwanda both deny involvement in the war, at
least 500 Ugandan troops, two tanks and anti-aircraft guns were
spotted by a British tourist about 170 kilometers (105 miles)
inside Congolese territory.
	   At least 2,000 Angolan and 600 Zimbabwean troops are now in the
country, a ministry-level government official said on condition of
anonymity.
	   Rwanda is believed to be the main sponsor of the rebel movement
_ a coalition of ethnic Tutsis and former members of Kabila's
military.
	   Efforts in South Africa to halt in fighting were blocked when
Congo's delegate to peace talks there and the government in
Kinshasa rejected a proposed cease-fire.
	   ``What we have said all along is that this rebellion is an
invasion by Rwanda and Uganda,'' said Ferdinand Mwana Naga, the
agriculture minister and one of Kabila's closest confidants. ``We
cannot stop fighting until those foreign aggressors are gone.''
	   Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo, representing Kabila at the
talks in Pretoria, said his government would allow foreign troops
to leave the country unfettered.
	   ``Congo will refrain from attacking the withdrawing troops,''
Kongolo said.
	   The peace talks were convened by President Nelson Mandela, who
heads the 14-member Southern African Development Community and who
proposed the cease-fire Sunday.
	   The call for a cessation of hostilities came after Angolan
forces in Congo's southwestern Atlantic Ocean corridor retook a
string of coastal towns in a stunning reversal of rebel gains.
	   Angolans are now in control of the oil port town of Muanda and
the nearby town of Banana.
	   Angolan reinforcements were moving toward Matadi, a vital Congo
river port town about 280 kilometers (175 miles) southwest of the
capital, Kinshasa, the ministry official said on condition of
anonymity.
	   The claims could not be independently confirmed, but a rebel
leader over the weekend acknowledged the loss of Kitona and its
airstrip, just a few kilometers (miles) east of Muanda.
	   Kitona, one of the first western towns to fall to the
insurgents, was used by the rebels to shuttle in reinforcements
airlifted across the country from their main bases in eastern
Congo.
	   On Monday, a U.S. envoy trying to mediate an end to the fighting
met in the Angolan capital with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
and said the talks were ``very positive and constructive.''
	   Howard Wolpe, the U.S. special envoy to Africa's Great Lakes
Region, said he and Dos Santos discussed prospects for a peaceful
solution to the insurrection.
	   ``We are looking for a political framework for this to happen,''
Wolpe told reporters in Luanda before leaving for South Africa,
where he said he would continue his efforts. He said he discussed
withdrawal of foreign troops with Dos Santos, but declined to
provide details.
	   Before the Angolans' entry, the Congolese rebels had make
remarkable progress toward Kinshasa in their three-week-old drive
to topple the government. Many of those same rebels helped put
Kabila into power after ousting longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu
Sese Seko last year.
	   The insurgents, who accuse Kabila of power-grabbing, tribalism
and mismanagement, have pushed to within 30 kilometers (18 miles)
of Kinshasa and still control the town of Mbanza-Ngungu, the last
major obstacle before the capital.
	   In Kinshasa there were varying accounts of fighting near the
town of Kasangulu, just south of Kinshasa, but no reports of gains
on either side.
	   Rebels in the west now appear to be caught between two foreign
forces at either end of a narrow corridor of Congolese territory
that links Kinshasa to the Atlantic coast.
	   The Angolans are to the southwest of the rebels and Zimbabwean
soldiers deployed last week are defending Kinshasa's southern
outskirts.
	   The rebels claim to be in control of the eastern city of
Kisangani.
	   Those claims also could not be independently confirmed.

President of Italian Olympic Committee questioned in doping probe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: ADDS quotes from Pescante, allegations by another official
from the Olympic Committee, photo line &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Questioned in an anti-doping investigation, the
president of Italy's Olympic committee said Monday he believes
there is no use of performance-enhancing substances among the
nation's soccer players.
	   ``I'm sure the word `doping' doesn't exist in soccer,'' Mario
Pescante told reporters after a two-hour meeting with the
prosecutor for the city of Turin, Raffaele Guariniello.
	   Guariniello is looking into allegations that top players in
Italy's first-division soccer league, Serie A, took illegal
substances.
	   Pescante also dismissed allegations that Italian Olympic
committee officials hid evidence that would prove the use of banned
substances by Serie A players.
	   In an interview with Italy's Corriere della Sera newspaper on
Saturday, committee official Sandro Donati said that the banned
drug EPO, or erythropoietin, is widely used in soccer. EPO, which
boosts oxygen absorption in the bloodstream, is the same substance
that several cyclists in the Tour de France are alleged to have
taken.
	   Donati also complained that a single group, the federation of
sports doctors, oversees all aspects of Serie A doping controls, a
system that ``seems to have been set up with the intent of
hindering transparency.''
	   ``This is fantasy,'' Pescante said Monday. ``The transparency of
(anti-doping) tests has never been questioned before.''
	   In another interview with France's Journal du Dimanche, Donati
insisted that Bologna prosecutor Giovanni Spinosa, who also is
looking into the allegations, has a ``very important dossier with
convincing elements'' to prove the use of EPO and even stronger
substances.
	   The Italian Olympic committee's anti-doping commission also is
conducting an inquiry.
	   All the investigations stem from comments by AS Roma coach
Zdenek Zeman, who said he was amazed by the quick muscular
development of some players, including Gianluca Vialli and
Alessandro Del Piero.
	   Vialli and Del Piero both denied wrongdoing, and sued Zeman.
	   Over the weekend, a top doping investigator for the nation's
Olympic committee, Ugo Longo, said they have ``not found any
elements which makes it seem that doping exists in soccer.''
	   ``On the contrary, I'd say that we can rule it out,'' he said.
	   The investigations, however, continue.
	   Longo said he might go to London to question Chelsea's Italian
players, Pierluigi Casiraghi, Roberto Di Matteo and Gianfranco
Zola, who were summoned by Italy's Olympic committee but didn't
show up.
	   On Tuesday, AS Roma's and Italy's national team midfielder,
Luigi Di Biagio, is scheduled to appear before the Italian Olympic
committee.

Council briefed on envoy's failed meetings with Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. chief's envoy told the Security
Council on Monday that he failed to persuade Baghdad to resume
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors after two rounds of
discussions with the Iraqi deputy prime minister, a U.S. diplomat
said.
	   The council wasn't expected to take any immediate action
following Prakash Shah's briefing on his meetings earlier this
month with Tariq Aziz. But the United States and Britain have
informally floated a proposal that the council consider suspending
future reviews of sanctions against Iraq unless it eases its
stance, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The council took such a move last year after Baghdad refused to
allow inspectors access to presidential palaces, which Iraq ruled
off limits citing its sovereignty.
	   The council has so far only called Baghdad's Aug. 5 announcement
that it was suspending cooperation with inspectors ``totally
unacceptable.'' On Thursday, council members decided to extend
sanctions against Iraq for at least another two months.
	   Iraq announced it was breaking off cooperation with the United
Nations because the chief weapons inspector, Richard Butler,
refused to certify that Baghdad had destroyed its banned weapons.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan dispatched Shah to try to persuade
Baghdad to back down. Butler has also asked for Iraq to resume
cooperation, but his request was rejected by Aziz last week.
	   The Security Council will continue the sanctions, imposed after
Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, until it is convinced that Iraq no
longer has long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons.
	   A suspension of regular sanctions reviews would scrap a
six-month review scheduled for October, when Iraq and its council
supporters were expected to push for the measures to be eased.
	   Iraq claims it has complied with U.N. resolutions and says
Washington is manipulating the inspections regime to maintain
sanctions.

 &UR; Kosovo fighting moves nearer to Pristina, sending refugees fleeing

	   VELIKA RIBORA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Stone-faced or crying, hundreds
of new refugees fled Serb tank fire Monday, as the drive to snuff
out the ethnic Albanian guerrilla movement fighting for Kosovo's
independence moved nearer to the capital of the Serbian province.
	   Dirt roads meandering through the cornfields south of Pristina
were dotted with tractors or horses pulling trailers piled with
women and children trying to find safety from the newest assault.
	   Smoke from burning villages thrust into the azure skies, and the
boom of explosions mingled with roosters crowing and other barnyard
sounds. At one point, jets, apparently of the Yugoslav air force,
were heard screaming overhead.
	   The attacks by Serb police and the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army
began late Sunday.
	   Refugees and villagers in Velika Ribora, just a few kilometers,
(miles) from the latest front rattled off a list of villages that
were being targeted by Serb tanks positioned in the hills near
Stimjle. The shelling extended in an area between 15 and 35
kilometers (about 10 and 20 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   Blerim Sadiku, driving a horse-drawn carriage with his family
members, mattresses and other belongings piled in the back, was
fleeing the area. ``It was too dangerous to stay,'' he said.
	   Asked where they were headed, he replied: ``We have no idea. We
have to ask someone for shelter.''
	   In Velika Ribora, women with children were sheltered in a
mosque. A nearby house with two rooms was crowded with more than 40
refugees. Residents said more than 1,000 refugees had arrived since
the shelling began Sunday.
	   One of them, Mehmet Olluri, said nearly 5,000 other refugees had
been camped out in forests and hills near Krajmirovca, roughly
halfway between Pristina and Prizren, without food for three weeks.
	   Humanitarian agencies estimate that about 50,000 Kosovo refugees
are trying to survive in the open.
	   There were sketchy reports of casualties from the most recent
bouts of fighting. Velika Ribora villagers said two people were
wounded, one seriously, by a shell that hit a house on the
outskirts of their community Sunday.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the ethnic Albanian
leadership, said two ethnic Albanians were killed in Sunday's
fighting near the town of Suva Reka. It also said Serb police
overnight had brought 10 bodies into a morgue in Djakovica _
victims of fighting near the Albanian border.
	   Ragip Zekolli, an Albanian official in Suva Reka said heavy
fighting continued in the region Monday.
	   The center also said a 19-year-old female fighter was killed
Sunday near Klina, 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Pristina, and a
man died in Pristina hospital from the after-effects of police
torture. The center identified some of the victims by name.
	   The Serb-run Media Center said one Serb policeman was killed
Sunday in the fighting southwest of the capital.
	   A journalist from Serb radio Pristina and his driver, who
disappeared Saturday in the Orahovac region, were still missing
Monday. Colleagues from the radio station appealed to international
organizations and human rights groups for help finding them.
	   Pristina has so far escaped the escalated fighting that has
killed hundreds of people and displaced an estimated 230,000 from
their homes since the Serbs launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian
rebels early this year.
	   Ethnic Albanians comprise about 90 percent of the population of
Kosovo, where most want independence from Serbia, the dominant
republic in the Yugoslav Federation.
	   The latest Serb actions are thought to be in retaliation for
reported KLA attacks Saturday and early Sunday on Serb police and a
Yugoslav army unit in the same region.
	   Serb forces have sent Kosovo Liberation Army fighters fleeing in
an all-out push since mid-July, forcing the heavily outmanned KLA
to regroup and change tactics.
	   In an interview published Monday, a rebel representative
acknowledged that the KLA will now rely on guerrilla warfare to win
the province's independence from Serbia, adding ``We will strike in
every corner of Kosovo.''
	   Adem Demaci told the Vienna news magazine Profil that the rebels
had made the ``fatal mistake'' of trying to ``defend a territory
they cannot defend.'' Instead, they want to launch surprise
strikes.
	   He said he is ready to start negotiations with Serb authorities
``when certain conditions are fulfilled'' _ primarily the end of
Serb attacks.
	   But the Serbian government says it will never negotiate with the
Kosovo ``terrorists.'' It considers Ibrahim Rugova, the pacifist
Kosovo Albanian leader who has U.S. and other foreign support, a
potential negotiating partner.

European champions head team for World Cup

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ All of Britain's six male gold medalists at the
European Championships in Budapest were named Monday to the British
team for next month's World Cup in South Africa.
	   Britain's two gold medal-winning relay teams were also named to
the 27-strong team for the Sept. 11-13 World Cup in Johannesburg.
	   The squad will be spearheaded by recently-crowned European
champions Jonathan Edwards (triple jump), Colin Jackson (110-meter
hurdles), Steve Backley (javelin), Darren Campbell (100 meters),
Doug Walker (200 meters) and Iwan Thomas (400 meters).
	   Edwards and Jackson are world record-holders and Backley is a
former world record-holder.
	   Britain won a championship-leading nine gold medals in Budapest
and finished with a total of 16 medals, including four silver and
three bronze.
	   Germany won eight gold, seven silver and eight bronze for a
total of 23, with Russia claiming six gold, nine silver and seven
bronze for a total of 22 medals.
	   British newspapers and television were saturated with images
glorifying the athletes and headlines boasting the dawn of a new
era in British athletics.
	   The ``Conquering Brits'' were billed as world-beaters.
	   The Daily Mail newspaper headline said it all: ``Britain's
golden boys take Europe by storm...now for the world.''
	   Even Queen Elizabeth II weighed in, saying she was ``delighted
to hear of the outstanding success of the British team.''
	   The Queen said she was looking forward to meeting some of the
athletes at the Commonwealth Games in Malaysia next month.
	   The British men's team qualified for the World Cup by winning
the European Cup in St. Petersburg in June.
	   As winners of the European Cup, Britain gains entry in the men's
competition and Russia competes in the women's events. Germany
qualified in both men's and women's divisions for the World Cup by
finishing second in both categories at the European Cup.
	   The United States is the only other nation competing in its own
right at the World Cup, with teams selected from various nations to
represent Asia, Africa, the Americas, Europe and Oceania.

Polish official says 2006 Olympic bid to proceed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland's government would give money to
Zakopane's bid to host the 2006 Winter Olympics, officials said
Monday.
	   Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz announced the Cabinet
Economic Committee supported the bid to host the Games at the
mountain resort near the border with Slovakia, 330 kilometers (200
miles) south of Warsaw.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Jerzy Miller said the government was
prepared to spend scores of millions of zlotys (dollars) for the
Zakopane bid. A formal government decision was expected Tuesday.
	   Miller said holding the Olympics in Zakopane would cost dlrs 850
million, and that the International Olympic Committee would put up
dlrs 415 million.
	   Winning the competition to host the Olympics would give Poland a
major boost in international exposure and also would bring needed
improvements to infrastructure in the Zakopane area.
	   Since the end of communist rule in 1989, Poland has enjoyed
steady economic growth and development but still lags behind major
Western countries in its infrastructure, services and technology.
	   The IOC will choose the host of the 2006 Winter Games in June
1999. There are six bids so far: Zakopane; Sion, Switzerland;
Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia; Turin, Italy; Helsinki, Finland, together
with Lillehammer, Norway; and Klagenfurt, Austria, making a
three-country bid that includes regions of Slovenia and Italy.
	   Sion is considered an early front-runner. The Swiss city was
among the finalists in the race for the 2002 Winter Games, which
were awarded to Salt Lake City.

Greene, Boldon resume quest for 100 world record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Maurice Greene and Ato Boldon are
back in Europe to resume their quest for the 100-meter world record
on the lightening-quick track of the Pontaise stadium.
	   Greene, the American world champion, and training partner
Boldon, the Trinidadian who has the fastest time in the world this
year, headline a top-flight 100-meter field for Tuesday's
Athletissima meet.
	   Also competing will be Namibia's Frankie Fredericks, who has run
more sub-10-seconds races than any other sprinter in history,
Americans Tim Montgomery and John Drummond and Canada's Bruny
Surin.
	   Darren Campbell, who won the European 100-meter title in
Budapest last week, will get a chance to see how he fares against a
much higher level of competition.
	   Missing from the field, however, will be Olympic champion and
world record-holder Donovan Bailey of Canada. He pulled a thigh
muscle at the Golden League meet in Zurich earlier this month and
will likely be out for the season.
	   Greene's last competition dates back to the Grand Prix meet in
Stockholm on Aug. 5. Greene and Boldon, who has twiced clocked a
season-best 9.86 this year, bypassed the Golden League meet in
Zurich, deemed the biggest one-day track event, due to a money
dispute with organizers.
	   Greene, who won the 100 in Lausanne last season in 9.90 seconds,
is convinced he can threaten Bailey's record of 9.84.
	   ``You can't program a record,'' Greene said. ``It could be
tomorrow like it could be next year. But I feel good.
	   ``On the track in Lausanne, which is very favorable for great
performances, the task is always possible,'' he said. ``I'm not
promising a world record at the Pontaise, but...''
	   The Pontaise track's reputation of being fast is well-earned.
	   It was on the Lausanne track that American Leroy Burrell set the
previous world record of 9.85 in 1994, before it was broken by
Bailey at the Atlanta Olympics.
	   Two years ago, Fredericks won here in 9.86.
	   While Greene's trainer John Smith acknowledges the American
might not lower the record on Tuesday, he is convinced his sprinter
will eventually succeed.
	   ``Who would have thought, a few weeks ago, that someone could
run the 1,500 in 3:26 minutes?'' Smith said, referring to Hicham El
Guerrouj's world record. ``You'll see, Maurice will at some point
reach his goal.''
	   The women's 100 on Tuesday will feature American star Marion
Jones, who is unbeaten at the distance this year.
	   But Jones won't be facing Christine Arron of France, the new
European champion who became the third fastest woman in history
with her time of 10.73 in Budapest.
	   Fans will have to wait until the Golden League meet in Brussels
on Friday for a showdown between Jones and Arron.
	   Jones, who has run under 11 seconds 12 times this year, will
attempt to improve on her personal best of 10.71, and inch closer
to Florence Griffith-Joyner's record of 10.49.
	   Double Olympic champion Michael Johnson will compete in the 400
along with fellow Americans Tyree Washington and Jerome Young. The
race will also include Britain's Jamie Baulch and Mark Richardson,
part of the winning 1,600-meter relay team at the European
Championships.
	   Three other British European champions will also be present.
World record-holder Jonathan Edwards will compete in the triple
jump, Colin Jackson in the 110-meter hurdles and Steve Backley in
the javelin.
	   France's Olympic champion Jean Galfione and European champion
Maksim Tarasov of Russia will lead the pole vault field.

Talks begin to keep CNN on Amsterdam cable
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with talks ending without solution; more discussions
scheduled for Tuesday &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Crisis talks Monday produced no
breakthrough in a dispute that looks like driving CNN's
round-the-clock news coverage off the Dutch capital's cable
television service.
	   The discussion between representatives of Amsterdam cable
provider A2000, the city council and the influential consumer
watchdog group Consumentenbond, were intended to head off a legal
battle to keep CNN International on the air.
	   But after an hour-long meeting at Amsterdam city hall, all the
delegations could agree on was another round of discussions
Tuesday.
	   Turner Broadcasting System announced last week it was refusing
to pay a 725,000 (dlrs 362,500) fee to A2000. The cable company
responded by ordering the plug pulled on the 24-hour news service
as of Tuesday.
	   The decision, which would make Amsterdam the only major European
city without CNN, prompted thousands of people to complain to
Consumentenbond.
	   An A2000 spokesman identified as A. Simmons told Dutch
television news that the company wanted to keep CNN on the air but
only if the news channel paid its way.
	   Representatives for CNN were not involved in the talks, said
Matthijs Spits, spokesman for Turner Broadcasting Systems Europe.
	   Former Amsterdam city councilor Walter Etty, who takes over the
chairmanship of Consumentenbond in October, said television viewers
should not become victims of the fee dispute between A2000 and CNN.
The consumers' group set up a telephone line Monday to log
complaints from irate viewers.
	   The Consumentenbond is planning to take out an injunction
preventing A2000 from dumping CNN if the talks fail to break the
deadlock but first they will meet both sides Tuesday in a last gasp
attempt to settle the dispute.
	   With its decision to fade to black in Amsterdam, CNN follows
music channel MTV Europe, Eurosport and The Discovery Channel, all
of which have gone off the air for the same reasons.
	   Although CNN still would be available through a satellite dish
and decoder, relatively few Dutch households have them.
	   ``Given that we have a good cable network in Amsterdam, it is
not a solution for everyone to go and buy a satellite dish,'' said
Consumentenbond spokesman Ap Zwinkels.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The final report on a 41-nation conference that
tried to unravel the jigsaw of looted Nazi gold called Monday for
greater openness of historical records _ and pointedly noted that
the Vatican has not responded to calls to open its World War II
archives.
	   Lord Mackay, the conference chairman, also announced that a fund
launched at the December meeting to compensate victims of Nazi
persecution has pledges of dlrs 57 million from 11 countries, and
promises of additional funds from other nations.
	   At the London conference, participants agreed to seek moral and
financial restitution for the victims of Nazi persecution.
	   The United States set an end-of-the-century deadline for
completing investigations into the atrocities and distributing cash
to Holocaust survivors, many nearing the end of their lives.
	   ``I think all present were agreed that the international
community must look urgently and imaginatively for ways to bring
relief to such people,'' Mackay wrote in the 834-page final report
published Monday.
	   ``The strong feeling of our conference was that we must all do
our utmost to get there by the end of the present century,'' he
wrote.
	   Mackay said there had been progress since the conference,
including the dlrs 1.25 billion Holocaust settlement by
Switzerland's two biggest commercial banks, and noted that a Swiss
government fund was helping victims ``wherever they may be,
principally in former Eastern Europe.''
	   Noting that 16 nations have set up commissions to investigate
their countries' roles in the Nazi era, Lord Janner, chairman of
The Holocaust Educational Trust, said: ``It is in no small part due
to the international determination symbolized by the London
conference that some measure of justice is starting to be done.''
	   At a news conference launching the report, Mackay said one of
the conference's key themes was the need to open government and
private archives so information can be made available to those
researching the history of gold looted by the Nazis.
	   ``We still do not know precisely how much gold the Nazis
stole,'' he said, citing estimates ranging from dlrs 650 million to
dlrs 7 billion.
	   Mackay announced that the archives of the Tripartite Gold
Commission, created by the Allies after the war to distribute gold
looted from central banks by the Nazis, will be opened after its
operations are wound up.
	   ``I understand that this is expected to take place within the
next few weeks,'' he said.
	   Since the conference, the commission has been returning the
final 5.5 tons of gold under its control to the nations whose
central banks were looted.
	   The three commission members _ the United States, Britain and
France _ had asked the countries entitled to gold to donate their
share to the new fund. Eight of the 11 contributors to the fund
were entitled to gold, but it was not clear whether their pledges
were related to the gold they received.
	   The conference report, which includes papers tracing the history
of Nazi gold from 31 countries, three banks, four organizations and
the Tripartite Commission, ``is an important step to encouraging''
openness, Mackay said.

Ballesteros ready to offer support to Mark James
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former European Ryder Cup captain Seve Ballesteros
says he's ready to offer any help _ if asked _ to Mark James, who
is widely expected to be named his successor this week.
	   The PGA European Tour is scheduled to announce the new Ryder Cup
captain on Wednesday in Munich, site of the BMW International Open.
There's little doubt that James, a member of seven Ryder Cup teams,
will be the choice.
	   ``Mark has played several times and has watched other captains _
Brian Huggett, John Jacobs, Tony Jacklin, Bernard Gallacher and
me,'' Ballesteros said Monday. ``I am sure he will pick up the best
from everybody. I wish him good luck.''
	   ``I was spoken to informally about who should be captain, but I
said I didn't want to be involved in that because whoever I say I
will automatically create enemies,'' the Spaniard said. ``I am not
going to give any advice here. If Mark asks anything I will give
him answers, but to volunteer things through the newspapers is not
fair.''
	   Ballesteros, who gave up the captaincy after guiding Europe to
victory over the United States at Valderrama in Spain last year,
said he doesn't ever expect to take the job again.
	   ``I have had no second thoughts about giving up the job and I
don't think I will ever be captain again,'' he said. ``I will never
say never, but 99.9 percent is no for sure.''
	   Looking back at his tenure, Ballesteros said there were some
difficult times.
	   ``When I was named captain I had one mission _ to win the Ryder
Cup,'' he said. ``That was achieved. There were a few
disappointments along the way and a couple of bitternesses, but the
mission was done.''
	   Balleteros had said he wanted to concentrate on earning a place
as a player on the European team for the 1999 Ryder Cup in
Brookline, Mass. But that remains a long shot.
	   Ballesteros, 41, slumped to a career-low 136th place in the
European Tour rankings last season. He has missed eight cuts this
year and currently lies 118th.
	   ``I want to play and to enjoy the game,'' he said. ``If I do, I
think I can make the team. But playing in the Ryder Cup is not my
goal. I've played many times, been captain and been very proud of
what I've done.''

Yeltsin on government firings: Russia needed a `heavyweight' at the

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ While Russians wondered aloud whether their
government was out of control, President Boris Yeltsin said Monday
he had reinstated his old prime minister because the country needed
a ``heavyweight'' at the helm.
	   Yeltsin also hinted that he expected Viktor Chernomyrdin, back
on top as acting prime minister, to be Russia's next president. But
a Kremlin spokesman refused to rule out the possibility that
Yeltsin would run again.
	   ``You ask the president,'' Sergei Yastrzhembsky said at a news
conference when asked if Yeltsin was bowing out.
	   Yeltsin dismissed his entire government on Sunday, including
young Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, and called back his old
subordinate, Chernomyrdin.
	   Chernomyrdin began his new stint as premier by holding out an
olive branch to parliament _ but one that might be regarded as
something closer to a bouquet of poison ivy to international
investors.
	   Chernomyrdin asked the State Duma, the lower house of
parliament, to set aside a package of economic austerity measures
demanded by international lenders. He said they ``do not play a
decisive role for financial stabilization,'' the ITAR-Tass news
agency said.
	   Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov said Chernomyrdin also agreed to
consider the formation of a coalition government with leading
parliamentary factions, Interfax reported. The Communist Party is
the largest faction in the Duma.
	   Russians appear to be growing increasingly tired of the chaos in
the Kremlin, where scarcely a month passes without Yeltsin firing a
high-ranking official. The entire government has been dismissed
twice this year.
	   ``Our country has everything but a brain,'' grumbled Alexander
Yumka, the manager of a Moscow construction company, in a typical
street-level assessment.
	   ``I personally feel ashamed,'' said Galina Velikzhanena, a
retiree pushing a baby stroller through a park. ``Our leaders can't
even put two words together. They can't even speak the language
grammatically.''
	   Yeltsin went on national television to explain, slowly and
glumly, the decisions he had announced in a terse statement on
Sunday. While he praised the ousted prime minister, the 36-year-old
Kiriyenko, he said the situation in the country demanded more
experienced hands at the wheel.
	   ``Today we need those whom we call heavyweights,'' he said. ``I
consider Chernomyrdin's experience and weight essential.''
	   The 60-year-old Chernomyrdin, a physically large man who
resembles Germany's Helmut Kohl, was ousted in March in favor of
Kiriyenko. At the time, Yeltsin said the country needed ``fresh
ideas and unorthodox approaches'' to tackle its deepening problems.
	   But Kiriyenko spent his five months in office trying to plug
leaks in a crumbling ceiling that finally came crashing down last
week, when he was forced to effectively devalue the national
currency, the ruble. If he had fresh ideas, he never had a chance
to implement them.
	   ``When you have a fire in your house, you don't think about how
to rebuild it, you just try to save it,'' said Yevgeny Volk, a
political analyst with the Heritage Foundation in Moscow. He added
that he considered the appointment of Chernomyrdin to be
``cosmetic.''
	   ``Unfortunately, the roots of the Russian financial problems are
too deep, and remain in the nature of the unreformed economy. ... I
don't expect a rapid improvement,'' he said.
	   Yastrzhembsky, Yeltsin's spokesman, agreed that the appointment
did not represent a change in direction.
	   ``The overall economic course will be unchanged and will aim at
developing a market economy, but there will be serious
transformations in terms of carrying out concrete policies,'' he
told reporters.
	   Chernomyrdin has not yet said what he intends to do. ``The first
thing I will do as acting head of government is to analyze the
situation on Russia's financial and stock markets,'' Chernomyrdin
was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   He faces a disastrous economic situation, in which the ruble's
value is sinking, Russia's banks are teetering on the brink of
collapse and foreign investors are fleeing the stock and money
markets in droves.
	   The ruble dropped 0.135 against the U.S. dollar on the interbank
currency exchange on Monday, to close sharply down at 7.14 rubles
to the dollar.
	   Stocks rallied, however, closing up 6.3 percent in light
trading. Gazprom, the national gas monopoly that Chernomyrdin used
to head, soared 24 percent.
	   While Chernomyrdin has, in the past, inspired some confidence in
Western governments and investors, he never undertook the tough
measures they thought were necessary to reform the Russian economy.
These include collecting taxes from the rich ``oligarchs'' who
support him politically and cutting government spending.
	   Yeltsin's statements about Chernomyrdin are sure to set off a
fresh round of political speculation.
	   The president said he was acting, in part, ``to ensure
continuity of the government in the year 2000. Viktor Stepanovich's
main advantages are decency, honesty, and thoroughness. I think
these qualities will be the decisive argument in the presidential
elections.''
	   Although it sounded like an endorsement, few people believe
Yeltsin has given up on the idea of running for another term
himself. And, given Yeltsin's popularity, which rarely rises above
5 percent in polls, an endorsement from Yeltsin could well be the
political kiss of death.

Norway's state bank hikes interest rates again to defend currency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The state central Bank of Norway raised its
key interest rates by 1.0 percentage point on Monday in a bid to
boost the value of the Norwegian currency.
	   The central bank has raised interest rates seven times this
year, including a dramatic 1.5 percentage point increase on Friday
that failed to fend off speculation against the Norwegian kroner.
	   The bank said it does not plan further immediate rate hikes,
which practice means it will allow the Norwegian krone to float,
with its value determined by the currency market. Until now, the
bank has attempted to maintain a stabile kroner exchange rate in
comparison to a basket of European currencies.
	   After Monday's rate hike, the bank's overnight lending rate to
other banks will be 10 percent and it rate on deposits will be 8
percent. The new rates take effect on Tuesday, the bank said in a
news release.
	   The value of the Norwegian krone has plunged in recent months to
its lowest level in the 1990s. Experts fear that the country's
economy is on the verge of overheating and that a minority
coalition government does not have the political strength needed to
tighten government spending.
	   Norway is the world's second largest oil exporter, and
government budget projections have been hard hit by a low oil
prices.

Hundreds of antiquities unearthed in planned parking lot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Archaeologists working on excavations at
the site of a planned parking lot in the courtyard of the
parliament building discovered hundreds of antiquities dating from
the Classical period to the Ottoman Empire, the culture ministry
announced Monday.
	   The finds include 145 graves dating from the early Mycenian to
the late Roman eras, as well as a unique bust depicting the fifth
century B.C. comic poet Eupolis, a contemporary and rival to
renowned playwright Aristophanes.
	   Up to eight archaeologists worked on the 18-month long project,
which covered an area of 8,000 square meters (86,114 square feet).
	   The parliament building is located in the center of Athens and
is within walking distance of the Acropolis.
	   The ministry did not say what it would do with the finds.
	   Archaeologists have in the past year stumbled across remarkable
finds during surveys of construction areas around the capital,
currently the site of many public works, including new subway lines
running through the heart of the ancient city.
	   Last year, they found a cemetery dating back to Pericles and the
golden age of Athens, as well as the Lyceum founded by Aristotle in
335 BC.

Gorbachev: Yeltsin wanted `insurance' in case he steps down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin brought back his old prime
minister because he could be trusted if Yeltsin has to step down,
former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was quoted as saying
Monday.
	   Yeltsin replaced his young prime minister, Sergei Kiriyenko,
with the more seasoned Viktor Chernomyrdin on Sunday.
	   ``I think he is trying to insure himself,'' Gorbachev told the
Interfax news agency, ``because the president has exhausted himself
both politically and physically and may step aside at any time.
Apparently, he could not rely on ... Kiriyenko.''
	   Gorbachev added that Chernomyrdin ``stands no chance'' of
winning the presidential election in 2000. Yeltsin made statements
Monday that some people interpreted as endorsing Chernomyrdin's
candidacy.
	   Gorbachev and Yeltsin are old and bitter rivals, and Gorbachev
frequently criticizes Yeltsin. His views receive almost no
attention in Russia, where he is widely reviled as the man
responsible for the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Source: British Airways plans first-ever purchase of Airbus jets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: LEADS with source saying British Airways will buy Airbus;
details, quotes throughout, no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Airways will loosen its ties with
long-time supplier Boeing Co. and order its first batch of jets
from Europe's Airbus Industrie, a source said Monday.
	   British Airways plans to buy 59 short-haul jets from Airbus,
including A319, A320 and A321 models while keeping Boeing as its
supplier for larger jets as it orders more Boeing 777s in a 3
billion pound (dlrs 5 billion) revamp of its fleet, said the
source, an industry executive who would speak only on condition of
anonymity.
	   Neither Airbus nor British Airways would confirm the deal _
which would be a huge blow to Boeing in the always intense rivalry
between the two big planemakers.
	   Airbus said British Prime Minister Tony Blair was set to speak
at a joint news conference with Airbus President Noel Forgeard
shortly after noon on Tuesday at Airbus headquarters in Toulouse,
France.
	   ``We never comment on speculation regarding possible
acquisitions, alliances, mergers or alliances,'' said Iain Burns, a
British Airways spokesman. ``If we had an announcement to make,
then we would do so.''
	   There has been much speculation recently that British Airways
would finally buy some Airbus jets. It now has 10 in its fleet that
came with the acquisition of a smaller airline several years ago _
but long has been considered one of Boeing's most loyal customers.
	   A Boeing spokesman, Scott Battishill, said from the company's
Seattle headquarters that he was unable to comment on how the
long-awaited British Airways order was shaping up.
	   British Airways announced in February that it would be buying a
new batch of short-haul jets to replace airplanes now flown from
its bases in Manchester, Birmingham and London Gatwick, as well as
for its French and German subsidiaries, Air Liberte and Deutsche
BA.
	   Although any defection to Airbus would be a big loss for Boeing,
British Airways is not completely giving up on the Seattle
planemaker.
	   British Airways plans to rearrange its mix of large Boeing jets,
using slightly smaller versions on some long-haul routes, according
to the industry source.
	   British Airways now flies to dozens of cities all over the world
using Boeing 747 jumbo jets, but in the future it will shift more
services to smaller jets such as the Boeing 777, the source said.
	   The strategy is perhaps new for a European airline, but it
mirrors the thinking of former American Airlines boss Robert
Crandall _ who stayed away from jumbo jets and flew smaller models
such as Boeing 767s on routes such as New York-London.
	   Jumbo jets make enormous profits for airlines when they are full
of passengers _ but they cost lots of money to operate and can be a
burden when they fly empty during slow seasons.
	   Crandall believed it was better to offer more flights every day
on popular routes, using smaller airplanes, and British Airways
chief executive Bob Ayling apparently now agrees that is the best
way forward in long-haul aviation.
	   By using more and smaller jets, airlines can add or subtract the
number of flights they make to individual cities as demand
warrants. And by offering more flights, the airlines become more
attractive to business travelers who are more concerned about the
timing of their flight than the price of their ticket.
	   The Wall Street Journal Europe first reported in Monday's
editions that British Airways will shift its long-haul strategy
away from the big jumbo jets.
	   The source who spoke to the AP said that the move ``is certainly
not a case of seeing the end of the 747 as we know it.''
	   The big jumbos are still the best way to serve such marks as
London to Australia and parts of Asia, or southern Africa and the
western United States, the source said, adding that those markets,
too, could eventually change and make smaller aircraft the way to
go.

	   VELIKA RIBORA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Stone-faced or crying, hundreds
of new refugees fled Serb tank fire Monday, as the drive to snuff
out ethnic Albanian guerrillas fighting for Kosovo's independence
moved nearer to the capital of the Serbian province.
	   Dirt roads meandering through the cornfields south of Pristina
were dotted with tractors or horses pulling trailers piled with
women and children trying to find safety from the newest assault.
	   Blerim Sadiku, driving a horse-drawn carriage with his family,
mattresses and belongings piled in the back, was fleeing the area.
``It was too dangerous to stay,'' he said.
	   Asked where they were headed, he replied: ``We have no idea. We
have to ask someone for shelter.''
	   Smoke from burning villages thrust into the azure skies, and the
boom of explosions mingled with roosters crowing and other barnyard
sounds. At one point, jets, apparently of the Yugoslav air force,
were heard screaming overhead.
	   The attacks by Serb police and the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army
began late Sunday.
	   Refugees and villagers in Velika Ribora, just a few kilometers,
(miles) from the latest front rattled off a list of villages that
were being targeted by Serb tanks positioned in the hills near
Stimjle. The shells landed between 15 and 35 kilometers (about 10
and 20 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   Pristina has so far escaped the escalated fighting that has
killed hundreds of people and displaced an estimated 230,000 from
their homes since the Serbs launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian
rebels early this year.
	   Ethnic Albanians comprise about 90 percent of the population of
Kosovo, where most want independence from Serbia, the dominant
republic in the Yugoslav Federation.
	   The latest Serb actions are thought to be in retaliation for
reported KLA attacks Saturday and early Sunday on Serb police and a
Yugoslav army unit in the same region.
	   Serb forces have sent Kosovo Liberation Army fighters fleeing in
an all-out push since mid-July, forcing the heavily outgunned KLA
to regroup and change tactics.
	   Humanitarian agencies estimate that about 50,000 Kosovo refugees
are trying to survive in the open.
	   In Velika Ribora, women with children were sheltered in a
mosque. A nearby house with two rooms was crowded with more than 40
refugees. Residents said more than 1,000 refugees had arrived since
the shelling began Sunday.
	   One of them, Mehmet Olluri, said nearly 5,000 other refugees had
been camped out in forests and hills near Krajmirovca, roughly
halfway between Pristina and Prizren, without food for three weeks.
	   There were sketchy reports of casualties from the most recent
bouts of fighting. Velika Ribora villagers said two people were
wounded, one seriously, by a shell that hit a house on the
outskirts of their community Sunday.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the ethnic Albanian
leadership, said two ethnic Albanians were killed in Sunday's
fighting near the town of Suva Reka. It also said Serb police
overnight had brought 10 bodies into a morgue in Djakovica _
victims of fighting near the Albanian border.
	   Ragip Zekolli, an Albanian official in Suva Reka said heavy
fighting continued in the region Monday.
	   The center also said a 19-year-old female fighter was killed
Sunday near Klina, 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Pristina, and a
man died in Pristina hospital from the aftereffects of police
torture.
	   The Serb-run Media Center said one Serb policeman was killed
Sunday in the fighting southwest of the capital.
	   In an interview published Monday, a rebel representative
acknowledged that the KLA will now rely on guerrilla warfare to win
the province's independence from Serbia, adding ``We will strike in
every corner of Kosovo.''
	   Adem Demaci told the Vienna news magazine Profil that the rebels
had made the ``fatal mistake'' of trying to ``defend a territory
they cannot defend.'' Instead, they want to launch surprise
strikes.
	   He said he is ready to start negotiations with Serb authorities
``when certain conditions are fulfilled'' _ primarily the end of
Serb attacks.
	   But the Serbian government says it will never negotiate with the
Kosovo ``terrorists.'' It considers Ibrahim Rugova, the pacifist
Kosovo Albanian leader who has U.S. and other foreign support, a
potential negotiating partner.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. chief's envoy to Iraq said Monday
he failed to persuade Baghdad to resume cooperation with U.N.
weapons inspectors because he had no proposals to negotiate with
the Iraqi deputy prime minister.
	   ``Basically, they felt that since I had come there only with a
message to comply and that I had no proposals to negotiate with
them, they had no reason to change the decision taken August 5th,''
Prakash Shah said after briefing the Security Council about his
meetings earlier this month.
	   Iraq announced Aug. 5 that it suspended cooperation with the
United Nations because the chief weapons inspector, Richard Butler,
refused to certify that Baghdad had destroyed its banned weapons.
	   The 15-member council has only called Baghdad's action ``totally
unacceptable'' but was not expected to take any immediate action on
Shah's briefing.
	   But the United States and Britain have informally floated a
proposal that the council consider suspending future reviews of
sanctions against Iraq unless it eases its stance, a U.S. official
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The deputy British ambassador, Stephen Gomersall, said the
United States and Britain would circulate a draft resolution later
in the week, but refused to say what the resolution would contain.
	   Last year, the council suspended sanctions reviews after Baghdad
refused to allow inspectors access to presidential palaces, which
Iraq ruled off limits citing its sovereignty.
	   A suspension of regular sanctions reviews would scrap a
six-month review scheduled for October, when Iraq and its council
supporters were expected to push for the measures to be eased.
	   The sanctions were imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
The Security Council will lift them only when it is convinced that
Iraq no longer has long-range missiles and chemical, biological and
nuclear weapons.
	   When Iraq announced Aug. 5 that it was refusing to cooperate,
Secretary-General Kofi Annan dispatched Shah to Baghdad and
suggested the council enact a comprehensive review of sanctions.
But it wasn't immediately clear how the council could reconcile
suspending regular reviews while agreeing to conduct a
comprehensive review.
	   Iraq's ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said Baghdad wasn't opposed to
such a comprehensive review, but that it would depend on how it was
conducted.
	   Iraq's main concern, he said, is the restructuring of Butler's
U.N. Special Commission, which carries out the inspections. Baghdad
claims Butler and UNSCOM are acting as a puppets of Washington to
keep maintain sanctions, despite Iraqi compliance with U.N.
resolutions.
	   ``Unless this restructuring takes place, Iraq finds it very
difficult, almost impossible, to keep any meaningful cooperation
with UNSCOM,'' Hamdoon said.

Norway raises interest rates again to defend currency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway's central bank raised key interest
rates by 1 percentage point on Monday in a bid to boost the sagging
national currency.
	   The increase by the Bank of Norway was the seventh so far this
year, including a 1.5 percentage point hike on Friday that failed
to fend off speculation against the kroner.
	   The bank said in a statement that it does not plan any further
rate increases in the near future, which means it will allow the
currency to float, with its value determined by the market. Until
now, the bank has attempted to maintain a stable exchange rate in
line with a basket of European currencies.
	   After Monday's increase, the bank's overnight lending rate to
other banks will be 10 percent and its rate on deposits will be 8
percent. The new rates take effect on Tuesday.
	   The value of the krone has plunged in recent months to its
lowest level in the 1990s. Experts fear that the country's economy
is on the verge of overheating and that a minority coalition
government does not have the political strength needed to tighten
government spending.
	   Norway is the world's second largest oil exporter, and
government budget projections have been hard hit by low oil prices.

Suspected pyromaniac firefighter arrested amid hot fire season
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Police have arrested a Paris fireman as
a suspected pyromaniac after a series of summer blazes in the
southwestern Cahors wine region, officials said Monday.
	   Meanwhile, the season's biggest fires in France burned in
Provence and on the island of Corsica, together consuming hundreds
of hectares (thousands of acres) as winds fanned the flames.
	   The 25-year-old fireman, who was not identified, was arrested in
Souillac last Thursday, after allegedly setting a blaze two days
before Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement was to inaugurate
a base at Cahors Airport for firefighting Canadair planes,
authorities said.
	   Eleven engine companies and 80 firefighters battled the blaze
that blocked train traffic between Paris and Toulouse, destroyed
two mobile homes and a mill.
	   Since June, six arson-caused fires have plagued the region, all
within 10 kms (six miles) of Souillac, the fireman's hometown where
he was on vacation with his family.
	   After several days, firefighters have controlled blazes on
Corsica and near Draguignan, a Provence town north of the Riviera.
Arson was suspected in some of the fires.
	   Seven fires burned more than 1,200 hectares (3,000 acres) on the
northern tip of Corsia near the port of Bastia, forcing the
evacuations of several homes and a camping area, officials said.
Two firefighters were injured in the blaze.
	   ``Mistral'' winds gusting up to 110 kph (65 mph) grounded the
Candair planes and spread the fire Saturday, but by Monday was
under control. Firefighters were to keep watch on the area for any
flare-ups for the next 48 hours.
	   The mayor of Morsiglia, Yves Stella, announced he would file a
complaint and demand an investigation into the fire near his town,
alleging it was deliberately set.
	   Near Draguignan, firefighters extinguished the blaze Monday,
after the Mistral calmed. The fire near Draguignan began under a
high-tension power line, though arson was not ruled out.

Super League promoters meet Europe's leading club in London
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Media Partners, the organization promoting a
breakway European soccer Super League, discussed the proposals
Monday with leading European clubs in London.
	   Media Partners released a brief statement confirming it held ``a
produtive meeting with a number of Europe's leading football
clubs.''
	   ``The well attended meeting discussed further the proposals to
develop the Euroepean Football League,'' the statement said.
	   No other details were provided.
	   The Sun newspaper reported Monday that Media Partners president
Rodolfo Hecht was meeting officials from Manchester United and
Arsenal.
	   The Sun said Hecht would outline his overall vision for the
league for the first time and give a five-point pledge, including
guarantees that qualification would be based on performance.
	   Hecht, a 43-year-old Italian businessman, said the ``project was
progressing well.''
	   ``We are having intensive talks with the leaders of European
football, all the top clubs and especially the national leagues,''
he was quoted as saying.
	   Speculation about a Super League forming by 2001 and involving
the biggest names in European soccer, including Bayern Munich,
Ajax, Inter and AC Milan, has increased since Media Partners met
with European soccer's governing body UEFA on Friday.
	   Hecht said his company did not want to erode UEFA's role as
governing body of European soccer, saying he wanted to work with
UEFA to develop the league.
	   However, UEFA could seek to head off the threat of a breakaway
leauge at a meeting in Monaco on Saturday, where changes to the
format of the three major European club championships will be
discussed.
	   Immediately after the meeting, UEFA plans to hold a press
conference at which it could announce changes to the format of its
three competitions.
	   One idea is to increase the number of teams in the Champions'
League from 24 to 32, and merge the Cup Winners' Cup and UEFA Cup.

President of Italian Olympic Committee questioned in doping probe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: ADDS investigator's suggestions to ban creatine &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Questioned in an anti-doping investigation, the
president of Italy's Olympic committee said Monday he believes
there is no use of performance-enhancing substances among the
nation's soccer players.
	   ``I'm sure the word `doping' doesn't exist in soccer,'' Mario
Pescante told reporters after a two-hour meeting with the
prosecutor for the city of Turin, Raffaele Guariniello.
	   Guariniello is looking into allegations that top players in
Italy's first-division soccer league, Serie A, took illegal
substances.
	   Pescante also dismissed allegations that Italian Olympic
committee officials hid evidence that would prove the use of banned
substances by the players.
	   In an interview with Italy's Corriere della Sera newspaper on
Saturday, committee official Sandro Donati said that the banned
drug EPO, or erythropoietin, is widely used in soccer. EPO, which
boosts oxygen absorption in the bloodstream, is the same substance
that several cyclists in the Tour de France are alleged to have
taken.
	   Donati also complained that a single group, the federation of
sports doctors, oversees all aspects of Serie A doping controls, a
system that ``seems to have been set up with the intent of
hindering transparency.''
	   ``This is fantasy,'' Pescante said Monday. ``The transparency of
(anti-doping) tests has never been questioned before.''
	   In another interview with France's Journal du Dimanche, Donati
insisted that Bologna prosecutor Giovanni Spinosa, who also is
looking into the allegations, has a ``very important dossier with
convincing elements'' to prove the use of EPO and even stronger
substances.
	   The Italian Olympic committee's anti-doping commission is
conducting its own inquiry.
	   Ugo Longo, a top investigator of the anti-doping commission,
said Monday that use of Creatine, a nonprescription muscle-builder,
should either be banned or restricted in order not to affect the
athletes' performances and health.
	   All the investigations stem from comments by AS Roma coach
Zdenek Zeman, who said he was amazed by the quick muscular
development of some players, including Gianluca Vialli and
Alessandro Del Piero.
	   Vialli and Del Piero both denied wrongdoing, and sued Zeman.
	   Over the weekend, Longo said they have ``not found any elements
which makes it seem that doping exists in soccer.''
	   ``On the contrary, I'd say that we can rule it out,'' he said.
	   The investigations, however, continue.
	   Longo said he might go to London to question Chelsea's Italian
players, Pierluigi Casiraghi, Roberto Di Matteo and Gianfranco
Zola, who were summoned by Italy's Olympic committee but didn't
show up.
	   On Tuesday, AS Roma's and Italy's national team midfielder,
Luigi Di Biagio, is scheduled to appear before the Italian Olympic
committee.

	   LONDON (AP) _ British Airways will loosen its ties with
long-time supplier Boeing Co. and order its first batch of jets
from Europe's Airbus Industrie, a source said Monday.
	   British Airways plans to buy 59 short-haul jets from Airbus,
including A319, A320 and A321 models while keeping Boeing as its
supplier for larger jets as it orders more Boeing 777s in a 3
billion pound (dlrs 5 billion) revamp of its fleet, said the
source, an industry executive who would speak only on condition of
anonymity.
	   Neither Airbus nor British Airways would confirm the deal _
which would be a huge blow to Boeing in the always intense rivalry
between the two big planemakers.
	   Airbus said British Prime Minister Tony Blair was set to speak
at a joint news conference with Airbus President Noel Forgeard
shortly after noon on Tuesday at Airbus headquarters in Toulouse,
France.
	   ``We never comment on speculation regarding possible
acquisitions, mergers or alliances,'' said Iain Burns, a British
Airways spokesman. ``If we had an announcement to make, then we
would do so.''

Swiss move to prevent suspected Egyptian extremist's entry
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Afghanistan-US Bombings &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss government said Monday it had
moved to prevent a reputed confidant of leading Islamic militant
Osama bin Laden from illegally entering Switzerland.
	   But Swiss officials denied an Egyptian government claim that
Ayman al-Zawahri had been issued a Swiss passport and said they had
no evidence he had ever been in Switzerland.
	   Bin Laden is suspected by the United States to have orchestrated
the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Al-Zawahri
reportedly called a Pakistani newspaper Friday from Afghanistan,
where he said he was with bin Laden.
	   Al-Zawahri read a statement from bin Laden declaring readiness
for war with Washington, according to the newspaper The News.
	   Al-Zawahri is considered to be a leader of Egypt's Jihad group,
which assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981. He was
released from an Egyptian prison in 1985 after serving four years
for belonging to the group. Later, he was sentenced to death in
absentia on other charges.
	   Felix Baenzeger, spokesman for the Swiss Federal Office of
Police Affairs, said Switzerland remained vigilant over the
possibility he could try to enter the country with falsified
documents.
	   ``We have taken appropriate measures,'' Baenzeger said, without
giving further details.
	   The Egyptian government, which lists al-Zawahri as one of its
most-wanted extremists, describes him as ``an associate of
terrorist Osama bin Laden.''
	   Swiss newspapers link al-Zawahri to the massacre of 58 tourists
in Luxor last November and the slaying of an Egyptian diplomat in
Geneva in 1995.
	   There have been frequent reports in recent years that
al-Zawahri, a medical doctor, was living in Switzerland.
	   He was reportedly awaiting approval of his application for
asylum and some reports claimed the Swiss had granted it. The
Egyptian government has reportedly asked the Swiss not to do so and
to return him to Egypt.
	   The Egyptian government's Internet site claims al-Zawahri holds
French and Swiss passports in the assumed name of Amin Othman.
	   It also claims he holds a Dutch passport bearing the name Sami
Mahmoud El-Hifnawi.

UConn basketball team hires security guards for Israel tour
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANNY BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The University of Connecticut basketball
team, which arrived in Israel Monday, said they are taking threats
against Americans seriously and hired two security guards to
protect them while in the country.
	   The team begins a series of friendly games against Israeli
professional teams beginning Tuesday in Tel Aviv.
	   Islamic militants have threatened to strike at American and
Israeli interests in retaliation for U.S. missile strikes last week
against suspected terror bases in Sudan and Afghanistan run by
Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden.
	   ``The administration of the University of Connecticut demanded
bodyguards and we readily agreed,'' said the teams' tour operator
Nels Hawkinson. ``Had it not been for the bombings in Afghanistan
and Sudan we would not have seen the need,'' he said.
	   But despite the security concerns, team coach Jim Calhoun said
he was excited to be back in Israel on his ninth visit to the
country. Calhoun cited a special relationship between UConn, which
has had four Israeli players, and the Jewish state.
	   Calhoun said the ``tour is especially important,'' because the
games against Israeli teams could help UConn, which isn't scheduled
to begin organized practice for another six weeks, get back into
shape.
	   Several stars, including injured Richard Hamilton, are not on
the tour but freshman point guard Khalid El-Amin, and newly
recruited Chris Smith will play in games against three Israeli
teams and one Greek team during the visit.
	   The first game will be against perennial national Israeli
champions Maccabi Tel Aviv, considered to be on of the top teams on
the international basketball circuit.
	   ``It's a chance of these guys to prove themselves. We are good
enough to really give Maccabi a game,'' Calhoun said a press
conference in Tel Aviv shortly after arriving.
	   Two Israeli security guards dressed in traditional dark blue
jackets and with ear pieces, stood at the entrance of the press
room at a Tel Aviv hotel and scanned reporters who entered the
room. It was not clear if the two men were armed. The guards will
accompany the players throughout their nine-day visit which
includes trips to Holy sites.
	   Security has been beefed up throughout Israel since the missile
strikes last Thursday.

Arafat, Peres commemorate Oslo Accords with hope on new progress
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Amid signs that the long-frozen Mideast
peace process may be thawing, Yasser Arafat and former Israeli
Prime Minister Shimon Peres on Monday commemorated the fifth
anniversary of the Oslo Accords that started the process, by saying
they cannot give up.
	   Palestinian President Arafat and Peres each had one arm around
the other's waist as they walked into the Norwegian Nobel
Institute. That is where they were picked for the 1994 Nobel Peace
prize they shared with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzahk Rabin, who
was assassinated the next year.
	   ``The Palestinian people have chose the way of the peace of the
brave,'' said Arafat in a speech to about 200 guests. ``I believe
the majority of the Israeli and the Palestinian people want
peace.''
	   He urged the international community to ensure that the terms of
the peace accords are fulfilled.
	   A framework agreement secretly worked out in months of
Norwegian-led meetings between Israelis and Palestinians led to a
1993 peace accord that was finalized in the night of Aug. 19-20 in
Oslo. It was signed in Washington D.C. in September 1993, and
recognized the Palestinian people.
	   ``In Oslo, what was the important thing is that we got a
Palestinian partner,'' Peres said in his speech. Peres said he
would do everything he could to see the terms of the accords
fulfilled.
	   The peace process has been bogged down since the right-wing
Likud government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took power
from Peres and the Labor Party in May 1996. Netanyahu did not
attend the Oslo ceremonies, saying he was too busy for such
nostalgia.
	   However, on Monday the Netanyahu government signaled that it may
ease conditions for withdrawing Israeli troops from 13 percent of
the occupied territories.
	   The government has insisted that the entire 545-member
Palestinian National Council clarify whether a clause in the
Palestine Liberation Organization's founding charter calling for
the destruction of Israel had been declared void.
	   But an Israeli government official said Netanyahu could now
accept the assurances of the 18-member PLO executive committee that
the clause had been deleted as a condition of starting troop
withdrawals.
	   After a speech harshly criticizing the Netanyahu government for
failing to live up to agreements, Arafat told reporters that he
could accept a recent Israeli proposal to include existing nature
reserves as part of the 13 percent of occupied territories from
which Israeli troops are to withdraw.
	   ``I can accept that,'' he said, as long as the deal conforms to
conditions of withdrawal. He said the proposal ``is a beginning.''
	   Arafat also said he was willing to meet Netanyahu, as long as
there was a good chance of substantive talks.
	   U.S. Peace Envoy Dennis Ross met representatives of the Israelis
and Palestinians during celebrations this weekend. He said he could
talk with Arafat, who arrived Monday afternoon, during the evening
to see if was a basis for suggesting renewed talks.
	   Ross said the gap between the Israelis and Palestinians had
narrowed, but refuse to discuss details.
	   ``We won't have a breakthrough until we have an agreement,''
said Ross, appearing at a news conference that also included
Arafat, Peres, and Meir Sheetrit, the leader of the Likud coalition
in Israel's Knesset.
	   In his own speech, Sheetrit, representing the Likud Party, said
the Israeli government is committed to peace.
	   Afterwards, Jan Egeland, a former Norwegian deputy foreign
minister who was a key player in the secret talks, said, ``I think
this five-year event in Oslo is proof that the Oslo process is not
dead. It is on its sickbed. We have to hope that Mr. Netanyahu, the
one who can resuscitate it, will use the opportunity.''

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ While Russians wondered aloud whether their
government was out of control, President Boris Yeltsin said Monday
he had reinstated his old prime minister because the country needed
a ``heavyweight'' at the helm.
	   Yeltsin also hinted that he expected Viktor Chernomyrdin, back
on top as acting prime minister, to be Russia's next president. But
a Kremlin spokesman refused to rule out the possibility that
Yeltsin would run again.
	   ``You ask the president,'' Sergei Yastrzhembsky said at a news
conference when asked if Yeltsin was bowing out.
	   Yeltsin dismissed his entire government on Sunday, including
young Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, and called back his old
subordinate, Chernomyrdin.
	   The abrupt change inspired inspired a wealth of rumors.
Communist Party Chairman Gennady Zyuganov predicted that Yeltsin
would resign within the next few weeks for health reasons, Interfax
reported.
	   Yeltsin has appeared tired at times lately, despite a 5-week
vacation that ended Monday. Although there is no indication that he
has been ill recently, he has a history of heart trouble and
members of his own staff have expressed concerns about his health.
	   Chernomyrdin began his new stint as premier by holding out an
olive branch to parliament _ but one that might be regarded as
something closer to a bouquet of poison ivy to international
investors.
	   Chernomyrdin asked the State Duma, the lower house of
parliament, to set aside a package of economic austerity measures
demanded by international lenders. He said they ``do not play a
decisive role for financial stabilization,'' the ITAR-Tass news
agency said.
	   Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov said Chernomyrdin also agreed to
consider the formation of a coalition government with leading
parliamentary factions. The Communist Party is the largest faction
in the Duma.
	   Russians appear to be growing increasingly tired of the chaos in
the Kremlin, where scarcely a month passes without Yeltsin firing a
high-ranking official. The entire government has been dismissed
twice this year.
	   ``Our country has everything but a brain,'' grumbled Alexander
Yumka, the manager of a Moscow construction company, in a typical
street-level assessment.
	   ``I personally feel ashamed,'' said Galina Velikzhanena, a
retiree pushing a baby stroller through a park. ``Our leaders can't
even put two words together. They can't even speak the language
grammatically.''
	   Yeltsin went on national television to explain, slowly and
glumly, the decisions he had announced in a terse statement on
Sunday. While he praised the ousted prime minister, the 36-year-old
Kiriyenko, he said the situation in the country demanded more
experienced hands at the wheel.
	   ``Today we need those whom we call heavyweights,'' he said. ``I
consider Chernomyrdin's experience and weight essential.''
	   The 60-year-old Chernomyrdin, a physically large man who
resembles Germany's Helmut Kohl, was ousted in March in favor of
Kiriyenko. At the time, Yeltsin said the country needed ``fresh
ideas and unorthodox approaches'' to tackle its deepening problems.
	   But Kiriyenko spent his five months in office trying to plug
leaks in a crumbling ceiling that finally came crashing down last
week, when he was forced to effectively devalue the national
currency, the ruble. If he had fresh ideas, he never had a chance
to implement them.
	   ``When you have a fire in your house, you don't think about how
to rebuild it, you just try to save it,'' said Yevgeny Volk, a
political analyst with the Heritage Foundation in Moscow. He added
that he considered the appointment of Chernomyrdin to be
``cosmetic.''
	   ``Unfortunately, the roots of the Russian financial problems are
too deep, and remain in the nature of the unreformed economy. ... I
don't expect a rapid improvement,'' he said.
	   Yastrzhembsky, Yeltsin's spokesman, agreed that ``the overall
economic course will be unchanged.''
	   Chernomyrdin has not yet said what he intends to do. ``The first
thing I will do as acting head of government is to analyze the
situation on Russia's financial and stock markets,'' Chernomyrdin
was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   He faces a disastrous economic situation, in which the ruble's
value is sinking, Russia's banks are teetering on the brink of
collapse and foreign investors are fleeing the stock and money
markets in droves.
	   The ruble dropped 0.135 against the U.S. dollar on the interbank
currency exchange on Monday, to close sharply down at 7.14 rubles
to the dollar.
	   Stocks rallied, however, closing up 6.3 percent in light
trading. Gazprom, the national gas monopoly that Chernomyrdin used
to head, soared 24 percent.
	   Yeltsin's statements about Chernomyrdin are sure to set off a
fresh round of political speculation.
	   The president said he was acting, in part, ``to ensure
continuity of the government in the year 2000. Viktor Stepanovich's
main advantages are decency, honesty, and thoroughness. I think
these qualities will be the decisive argument in the presidential
elections.''
	   Although it sounded like an endorsement, few people believe
Yeltsin has given up on the idea of running for another term
himself. And, given Yeltsin's popularity, which rarely rises above
5 percent in polls, his endorsement could well be the political
kiss of death.

President of Italian Olympic Committee questioned in doping probe

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Questioned in an anti-doping investigation, the
president of Italy's Olympic committee said Monday he believes
there is no use of performance-enhancing substances among the
nation's soccer players.
	   ``I'm sure the word `doping' doesn't exist in soccer,'' Mario
Pescante told reporters after a two-hour meeting with the
prosecutor for the city of Turin, Raffaele Guariniello.
	   Guariniello is looking into allegations that top players in
Italy's first-division soccer league, Serie A, took illegal
substances.
	   Pescante also dismissed allegations that Italian Olympic
committee officials hid evidence that would prove the use of banned
substances.
	   In an interview with Italy's Corriere della Sera newspaper on
Saturday, committee official Sandro Donati said that the banned
drug EPO, or erythropoietin, is widely used in soccer. EPO, which
boosts oxygen absorption in the bloodstream, is the same substance
that several cyclists in the Tour de France are alleged to have
taken.
	   In another interview with France's Journal du Dimanche, Donati
insisted that Bologna prosecutor Giovanni Spinosa, who also is
looking into the allegations, has a ``very important dossier with
convincing elements'' to prove the use of EPO and even stronger
substances.
	   The Italian Olympic committee's anti-doping commission is
conducting its own inquiry.
	   Ugo Longo, a top investigator of the commission, said Monday
that use of Creatine, a nonprescription muscle-builder, should
either be banned or restricted in order not to affect the athletes'
performances and health.
	   All the investigations stem from comments by AS Roma coach
Zdenek Zeman, who said he was amazed by the quick muscular
development of some players, including Gianluca Vialli and
Alessandro Del Piero.
	   Vialli and Del Piero both denied wrongdoing, and sued Zeman.
	   Over the weekend, Longo said they have ``not found any elements
which makes it seem that doping exists in soccer.''
	   ``On the contrary, I'd say that we can rule it out,'' he said.
	   The investigations, however, continue.
	   Longo said he might go to London to question Chelsea's Italian
players, Pierluigi Casiraghi, Roberto Di Matteo and Gianfranco
Zola, who were summoned by Italy's Olympic committee but didn't
show up.
	   On Tuesday, AS Roma's and Italy's national team midfielder,
Luigi Di Biagio, is scheduled to appear before the Italian Olympic
committee.

Israel increases security at airports following threats

 &UR; By DANNY BEN-TAL &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LOD, Israel (AP) _ Israel is adding security personnel at its
international airport in response to threats by Islamic militants
to attack Israeli and U.S. targets, including airlines, officials
said Monday.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's senior adviser, David
Bar-Illan, said Israel would use all measures it deemed necessary
to fight terrorism.
	   Asked whether this included pre-emptive strikes, Bar-Illan told
The Associated Press: ``I don't want to be specific about anything
but obviously we are not ruling out anything.''
	   Threats against U.S. and Israeli targets emerged after last
week's U.S. air strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan that were aimed at
Osama bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire and Islamic militant linked to
the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa this month.
	   On Sunday, a leading Muslim activist close to bin Laden said
Islamic militants are preparing to retaliate for the air strikes by
targeting U.S. and Israeli strategic sites and airliners.
	   A U.S. basketball team from the University of Connecticut, which
arrived Monday for a nine-day tour of friendly games, hired two
private security guards to accompany them in Israel.
	   ``The administration of the University of Connecticut demanded
bodyguards and we readily agreed,'' said the teams' tour operator
Nels Hawkinson. ``Had it not been for the bombings in Afghanistan
and Sudan we would not have seen the need,'' he said.

	   VELIKA RIBORA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Stone-faced or crying, hundreds
of new refugees fled Serb tank fire Monday, as the drive to snuff
out ethnic Albanian guerrillas fighting for Kosovo's independence
moved nearer to the capital of the Serbian province.
	   Dirt roads meandering through the cornfields south of Pristina
were dotted with tractors or horses pulling trailers piled with
women and children trying to find safety from the newest assault.
	   Blerim Sadiku, driving a horse-drawn carriage with his family,
mattresses and belongings piled in the back, was fleeing the area.
``It was too dangerous to stay,'' he said.
	   Asked where they were headed, he replied: ``We have no idea. We
have to ask someone for shelter.''
	   Smoke from burning villages thrust into the azure skies, and the
boom of explosions mingled with roosters crowing and other barnyard
sounds. At one point, jets, apparently of the Yugoslav air force,
were heard screaming overhead.
	   The attacks by Serb police and the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army
began late Sunday.
	   Refugees and villagers in Velika Ribora, just a few kilometers,
(miles) from the latest front rattled off a list of villages that
were being targeted by Serb tanks positioned in the hills near
Stimjle. The shells landed between 15 and 35 kilometers (about 10
and 20 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   Pristina has so far escaped the escalated fighting that has
killed hundreds of people and displaced an estimated 230,000 from
their homes since the Serbs launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian
rebels early this year.
	   Ethnic Albanians comprise about 90 percent of the population of
Kosovo, where most want independence from Serbia, the dominant
republic in the Yugoslav Federation.
	   The latest Serb actions are thought to be in retaliation for
reported KLA attacks Saturday and early Sunday on Serb police and a
Yugoslav army unit in the same region.
	   Serb forces have sent Kosovo Liberation Army fighters fleeing in
an all-out push since mid-July, forcing the heavily outgunned KLA
to regroup and change tactics.
	   Humanitarian agencies estimate that about 50,000 Kosovo refugees
are trying to survive in the open.
	   In Velika Ribora, women with children were sheltered in a
mosque. A nearby house with two rooms was crowded with more than 40
refugees. Residents said more than 1,000 refugees had arrived since
the shelling began Sunday.
	   One of them, Mehmet Olluri, said nearly 5,000 other refugees had
been camped out in forests and hills near Krajmirovca, roughly
halfway between Pristina and Prizren, without food for three weeks.
	   There were sketchy reports of casualties from the most recent
bouts of fighting. Velika Ribora villagers said two people were
wounded, one seriously, by a shell that hit a house on the
outskirts of their community Sunday.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the ethnic Albanian
leadership, said two ethnic Albanians were killed in Sunday's
fighting near the town of Suva Reka. It also said Serb police
overnight had brought 10 bodies into a morgue in Djakovica _
victims of fighting near the Albanian border.
	   Ragip Zekolli, an Albanian official in Suva Reka said heavy
fighting continued in the region Monday.
	   The center also said a 19-year-old female fighter was killed
Sunday near Klina, 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Pristina, and a
man died in Pristina hospital from the aftereffects of police
torture.
	   The Serb-run Media Center said one Serb policeman was killed
Sunday in the fighting southwest of the capital.
	   In an interview published Monday, a rebel representative
acknowledged that the KLA will now rely on guerrilla warfare to win
the province's independence from Serbia, adding ``We will strike in
every corner of Kosovo.''
	   Adem Demaci told the Vienna news magazine Profil that the rebels
had made the ``fatal mistake'' of trying to ``defend a territory
they cannot defend.'' Instead, they want to launch surprise
strikes.
	   He said he is ready to start negotiations with Serb authorities
``when certain conditions are fulfilled'' _ primarily the end of
Serb attacks.
	   But the Serbian government says it will never negotiate with the
Kosovo ``terrorists.'' It considers Ibrahim Rugova, the pacifist
Kosovo Albanian leader who has U.S. and other foreign support, a
potential negotiating partner.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's president said Monday that if the
United States truly believed a Khartoum factory made chemical
weapons, it committed ``an ugly crime'' by bombing it in the midst
of a city and endangering thousands of lives.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, President Omar Hassan
el-Bashir argued this was evidence U.S. officials knew the Khartoum
plant made only medicines _ as Sudan maintains.
	   El-Bashir also said he was recalling Sudan's ambassador to
Britain and would ask London to withdraw its ambassador in response
to Britain's support for the U.S. missile strike on the factory
Thursday night.
	   The president last week called back all Sudanese diplomats from
Washington. On Monday he said American diplomats, who have been
working out of neighboring Kenya and Egypt since 1996, ``will not
be allowed to return to their work in Khartoum.''
	   He added that ambassadors from European countries that supported
the missile strike would be summoned ``to inform them of our strong
protest for their positions.''
	   In the latest government-staged demonstration, several hundred
women rallied in Khartoum on Monday to denounce the attack on the
factory.
	   ``Away, away, USA!'' the protesters shouted. Most were from
women's groups loyal to the Islamic government or students let out
of school for the rally.
	   ``God willing, we'll create a million factories for chemical
weapons,'' said Naamat Abdel-Razeq, 28. ``If they want to destroy
plants, then we'll build them.''

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ A bomb exploded in a regional
administration building near the border with breakaway Abkhazia on
Monday, killing a woman and child and injuring 30 other people,
officials said.
	   The blast in the town of Zugdidi occurred shortly after noon in
a four-story building that houses the regional government and
several other offices. At least two people were killed, said
regional police chief Col. Shakro Berishvili.
	   The force of the explosion was equivalent to at least five
kilograms (11 pounds) of TNT, he said.
	   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but
President Eduard Shevardnadze denounced it as an act of terrorism.
	   ``This terrorist act was inspired and implemented by the enemies
of the country, but despite their far-reaching plans it will not
affect the Georgian people's will to build an independent and
democratic state,'' Shevardnadze said in a statement issued by his
office.
	   Following the blast, authorities were tightening security in
street markets, the post office and other administration buildings
in Zugdidi.
	   The region has been plagued by violence since Abkhazia's
13-month war for independence ended in 1993. Sporadic clashes
between separatists and forces loyal to Georgia's central
government have also continued, despite the Russian peacekeepers
stationed in the region.

Hundreds of antiquities unearthed in planned parking lot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Archaeologists working at the site of a
planned parking lot in central Athens have discovered hundreds of
artifacts dating from the Classical period to the Ottoman Empire,
the Culture Ministry announced Monday.
	   The finds include 145 graves dating from the early Mycenian, in
about 1450 B.C., to the late Roman eras, as well as a unique bust
depicting the fifth century B.C. comic poet Eupolis, a contemporary
and rival to renowned playwright Aristophanes.
	   Up to eight archaeologists worked on the 18-month long project,
which covered an area of 8,000 square meters (86,114 square feet),
in the courtyard of the Parliament building.
	   The Parliament is within walking distance of the Acropolis.
	   The ministry did not say what it would do with the finds.
	   In the past year, archaeologists have stumbled across remarkable
finds during surveys of construction areas around the capital.
Athens is currently the site of many public works, including new
subway lines running through the heart of the ancient city.
	   Last year, archaeologists found a cemetery dating back to
Pericles and the golden age of Athens in the 5th century B.C., as
well as the Lyceum founded by Aristotle in 335 BC.

<TEXT>
	   WORCESTER, England (AP) _ The inaugural womens Ashes test
cricket series between England and Australia fizzled out to a
winless tie Monday.
	   England batted out the last day of the third and final test at
Worcester to finish 190 for six in its second innings and ensure
the series was tied 0-0.
	   Australia had a chance to win the test and clinch the series,
bowling England out for 243 and then scoring 427 for four before
declaring and attempted to bowl England out. But play was abandoned
due to rain on Sunday and the chance of a result was unlikely.
	   For Australia, Karen Rolton top scored with 176 not out, while
Belinda Clark scored 136.

 &UR; Israel softens position on key issue, progress on pullback seen

 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Despite continued tensions between the
sides, a deal on an Israeli troop withdrawal seemed closer Monday,
with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly dropping a key
precondition to an agreement.
	   Palestinian negotiators confirmed Israel has softened its
position but said that differences were still unresolved regarding
an American proposal for an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13
percent of the West Bank.
	   Netanyahu's aide, David Bar-Illan said that Israel was
``considering the American ideas of 13 percent if they are divided
into two parts,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   Negotiators from both sides were likely to meet with U.S. peace
envoy to the Middle East, Dennis Ross at a ceremony in Oslo,
Norway, Monday, marking the fifth anniversary of peace-making
between the sides.
	   One stumbling block to an agreement had been Israel's insistence
that the Palestinians convene the 545-member Palestine National
Council to remove ambiguity about whether it had canceled clauses
in the PLO charter which call for Israel's destruction.
	   Palestinians have maintained the PNC already took action to
revoke the charter. A senior Israeli official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said that Israel told U.S. negotiators that
it would now agree to start the withdrawal process without a new
meeting.
	   The official said Israel was now willing to accept a statement
from the smaller PLO executive committee that it would reconvene
the PNC within the four-month period of phased pullbacks.
	   Netanyahu's office denied an Israeli newspaper report that the
premier had reversed his stand on the PLO charter, saying that
Netanyahu told U.S. President Bill Clinton in a telephone
conversation Friday that amending the charter ``is a basic
condition of the agreement with the Palestinians.''
	   In the tensely divided West Bank city of Hebron, where a
prominent rabbi was killed last week by a Palestinian assailant,
Israel troops enforced a curfew in the downtown area for a fourth
day and fired rubber bullets at Palestinian stone throwers.
	   About a dozen Palestinian children threw stones from rooftops
onto Israeli soldiers in the streets below. Troops fired two rounds
of rubber bullets towards the protesters. There were no reports of
injuries.
	   Twelve Palestinians were also detained after they broke curfew
and lined up by troops for identity checks. The army eased a siege
over the city however, permitting some 6,000 workers and merchants
to leave town and get to jobs in Israel.
	   Meanwhile, a group of 11 hardliners in Netanyahu's coalition,
known as the Greater Land of Israel Front, threatened to topple the
government if Israel cedes the additional 13 percent of West Bank
land to Palestinians control.
	   ``We are holding this meeting to signal to the prime minister,
in case he has a short memory, that his coalition will not allow
him to do something against the wishes of the people who elected
him,'' Michael Kleiner, head of the group and a member of the
Gesher Party, told the AP.
	   Netanyahu controls 61 of 120 seats in parliament, and the
Kleiner group could topple him.
	   Palestinian officials said a new, exploratory channel had been
opened between Netanyahu confidant Yitzhak Molcho, and Ahmed
Qureia, the speaker of the Palestinian legislative council. They
also said Israel was backing away from previous positions.
	   ``The Israelis called us and said we have something new we want
to show you. They said, `we have abandoned our demand for the
convening of the PNC' and said that they are willing to withdraw
from 13 percent ...,'' said Nabil Shaath, a minister in Arafat's
Cabinet and a top negotiator.
	   Bar-Illan said that the 13 percent would need to be divided into
two parts, with 3 percent turned into a nature reserve where the
Palestinians would not be allowed to maintain a police presence of
build.
	   But Palestinian officials said they were not ready to accept
Israeli conditions on the use of 3 percent of the land targeted for
the next withdrawal.

SairGroup determined to offset impact of Asian financial crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ SAirGroup, parent of national airline
Swissair, is determined to take action to offset the impact of
Asian financial turmoil, the group's chairman and chief executive
said Monday in a letter to shareholders.
	   The company has put in place measures to offset setbacks in the
Asian market, including strengthening other airline routes, such as
those to San Francisco, New York and Johannesburg.
	   It would like to acquire a slice of the French airline AOM, said
President and Chief Executive Officer Philippe Bruggisser said.
SAirGroup expects to know more about this prospect by the end of
this year, Bruggisser said.
	   The company also has a game plan to deal with any possible
downturn in the airline sector.
	   ``We are confident of taking effective action to offset the
impact of the Asian crisis,'' chairman Hannes Goetz and Bruggisser
said.
	   The company expects the current positive trends it is
experiencing to continue for the rest of the year, Goetz and
Bruggisser said. The group Thursday reported a 17 percent rise in
net profit to 109 million Swiss francs (dlrs 72.6 million) in the
first half of 1998. The firm said some parts of its business, which
also includes catering operations and hotels, were hit by the
economic problems in Asia.
	   But at a news conference later, company officials played down
the impact of the Asian turmoil.
	   The impact of Asia's troubles shaved 140 million Swiss francs
(dlrs 93 million) from group revenues in the first half, when the
company still reported an 11 percent rise to 5.4 billion Swiss
francs (dlrs 3.6 billion) from a year earlier.

Six dead in apparent shootout between border drug gangs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK STEVENSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican police searched an area near the U.S.
border Monday for gunmen who killed six members of a rival drug
gang and left their bodies scattered on dusty roads in northern
Tamaulipas state.
	   The killings of three Trevino brothers _ one of the worst
drug-related shootouts in recent years _ basically dismantled their
gang. Only one brother who allegedly runs the drug operations
remains alive.
	   But the ``Crazy Monk's'' gang _ which may have extended its
field of cocaine and marijuana trafficking over a stretch of the
Mexican-U.S. border reaching from Matamoros to Reynosa _ has only
built its fame and influence.
	   ``They have a very bad reputation, the killers,'' said Martin
Cuevas, local commander of the Tamaulipas state investigative
police.
	   The killings were carried gangland style, complete with assault
rifles, screeching trucks, chases over rural roads, an ambush and
an estimated two hundred shots fired.
	   ``We've searched Matamoros and Valle Hermoso, but we think they
may have fled deeper into Mexico,'' Cuevas said.
	   Four of the victims, who reportedly belonged to the Trevino
brothers' drug gang, were kidnapped late Saturday when two vans and
a pickup truck screeched up to where they were standing in front of
a hotel in Valle Hermoso, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of
Brownsville, Texas.
	   The kidnappers were armed with high caliber pistols and assault
rifles and are believed to be members of a rival drug gang run by
Hugo Baldomero Medina, known as ``The Crazy Monk.''
	   The attack was apparently in revenge for the police seizure
earlier this month of a half ton of Medina's cocaine by police,
apparently on a tip by the Trevinos.
	   The kidnappers forced the victims into the vans and sped down a
dirt road, stopped and waited on a curve for the pursuers.
	   One of those who survived the attack told local reporters that
the killers cut off the pursuers, rammed their car and sprayed them
with gunfire, killing two Trevinos and wounding a third.
	   The killers abandoned their trucks, and further north on the
road police the bullet-ridden bodies of the four kidnap victims,
including another Trevino brother.

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Liberia, Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa,

<TEXT>
	   ------ &QC; 
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ A former Liberian warlord has warned
the government that fighting could break out again in the capital
if he and his supporters are not left in peace.
	   Roosevelt Johnson, who spent years as the battlefield foe of
warlord-turned-President Charles Taylor, said Saturday that
security forces have been harassing his loyalists and trying to get
into his home.
	   He urged religious leaders to calm the situation, saying he was
being purposely provoked to violence.
	   ``I don't want it to reach a stage where trouble will come to
this country again,'' he warned. ``If war breaks out again,
everywhere in Monrovia will be on fire.''
	   While fighting ended in Liberia in 1996 and Taylor was elected
president the following year, deep-seated enmity remains between
the two men.
	   Fighting last broke out in Monrovia in April 1996 when Taylor
and his allies tried to arrest Johnson. The confrontation led to
months of grisly street battles in this seaside capital.
	   Taylor started Liberia's war in 1989 in a bid to overthrow the
ethnic Krahn dictatorship of Samuel Doe, but it soon disintegrated
into a multi-sided civil war. More than 150,000 people died in the
seven-year conflict.
	   ----- &QC; 
	   Lagos, Nigeria (AP) _ The Nigerian military junta has assured
the family of late opposition politician Moshood Abiola that the
enormous debt the government owes him will be repaid quickly,
newspapers have reported.
	   The government will also return Abiola's oil-prospecting license
to his business empire, the Lagos Punch newspaper said Saturday.
	   Abiola, a multimillionaire whose businesses included shipping,
telecommunications, newspapers and petroleum, saw his empire
largely collapse during his imprisonment.
	   Abiola, who died of a heart attack in prison early last month,
was the apparent winner of the 1993 presidential elections that
were canceled by the military. He was jailed the following year and
accused of treason by dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, who died in June.
	   It was not immediately clear how much money the government owes
to Abiola's various businesses, but it is believed to run into the
millions of dollars.
	   Abacha's successor, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, has vowed to
return Nigeria to democracy and to clean up the corruption that
largely crippled the country's economy during Abacha's rule.
	   The newspaper said officials made the pledge to the Abiola
family during Abubakar's visit to Lagos last week.
	   ---- &QC; 
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Clinical trials of the anti-impotency drug
Viagra are soon to begin in select Nigerian hospitals, newspapers
reported.
	   The drug was to be tested in five hospitals in line with
regulations of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration
and Control, the Guardian newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The trials, to be sponsored by the drug's manufacturer Pfizer,
will continue until the beginning of next year after which Viagra
could be approved for wider distribution and sale, the Guardian
report said, quoting Ife Egubuchman, product manager for a local
pharmaceutical company involved in the trials.
	   Egubuchman, who refused to name the hospitals involved in the
tests, said that samples of the drugs had been distributed to test
on impotent men.
	   Viagra, smuggled in illegally by private dealers, is already
available on the Nigerian market in Lagos and other big cities.
	   ---- &QC; 
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Five more people have died after drinking
a lethal home brew sold in villages in the Rift Valley, raising the
death toll to 34, a newspaper said Monday.
	   A police officer in Rift Valley province, quoted by the
newspaper, said the death toll could be higher because some people
in the area bury their dead immediately without notifying
authorities.
	   Nakuru District Commissioner John Litunda said the first reports
of deaths were received Aug. 17.
	   Litunda said the brew, known as ``power alcohol,'' is believed
to be made from industrial chemicals. Samples have been sent for
laboratory analysis.
	   ``As I am talking to you, there are 12 people in the outpatient
patient hall waiting to be treated,'' the Standard quoted senior
nursing officer Samson Aduda at Kijabe Mission Hospital as saying.
	   He said those suffering from the poisoning complain of diarrhea,
drowsiness and blurred eyesight.
	   The drink is popular because it is cheap. One glass costs 10
shillings (about 6 U.S. cents). A pint bottle of lager beer costs
about 52 shillings (86 U.S. cents).
	   The newspaper said several people had been arrested for selling
the illegal brew.
	   ------ &QC; 
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A 25-year-old guide was killed
by a leopard in Kruger National Park while leading tourists on a
nighttime drive to view wild animals, Beeld newspaper reported on
Monday.
	   Charles Swart was leading his first night-time drive at the end
of his practical training, and stopped on a bridge so the tourists
could take photos.
	   He got out to check if it was safe and was attacked by the
leopard, Beeld said.
	   Skukuza police spokesman Sergeant Piet Prinsloo said the
leopard, which was shot by game wardens, was very old and probably
unable to hunt very well.
	   ----- &QC; 
	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) _ Candidates in 350 chiefdoms and urban
communities were nominated for primary elections while trade
unionists called for a vote boycott.
	   Primary elections on Sept. 12 will choose two top candidates in
each of 50 constituencies who will then contest general elections
Oct. 9.
	   Earlier this month, King Mswati III dissolved Parliament to
prepare for the elections.
	   The Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions on Sunday called for
the boycott. It opposes the elections because the monarchy forbids
the formation of political parties.
	   Mswati's father, King Sobhuza II, outlawed all party activity in
1973. The tiny mountain realm of 1 million people has since lived
under a state of emergency that allows the king to rule by decree.
	   Many Swazis like the system, which brought a degree of stability
rare in southern Africa in the 1970s and 1980s. But others are
demanding to join a regional surge of democracy capped by Mandela's
election in 1994.
	   ----- &QC; 
	   QUEENSTOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Heavy snowfalls reaching 25
centimeters (10 inches) fell in southeastern South Africa, covering
mountains and hills in the region and blocking some passes.
	   The snow fell over the weekend.
	   The weather station in Molteno reported a maximum temperature of
2 degrees Celsius (36 degrees Fahrenheit) on Sunday.

Newspapers report unusual troop movement in Namibia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN GROBLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia _ Hundreds of troops and newly outfitted
armored vehicles are being transported north within Namibia after
the government promised to support Congo in its fight against
rebels, two newspapers reported Monday.
	   The dailies Die Republikein and The Namibian reported that a
column of about a dozen armored vehicles is moving troops north
toward Zambia and Angola. Such large troop movements are unusual in
Namibia, where military units usually remain stationary.
	   Namibian President Sam Nujoma last week supported a decision by
Zimbabwe, Zambia and Angola to support Congolese President Laurent
Kabila's fight to stem a rebel insurrection.
	   The government has refused to comment on the reports, as it has
since initial reports appeared weeks ago about the defense force's
shipment of weapons and materiel to support Angola and Congo.
	   Die Republikein, Namibia's largest daily, also reported that two
companies of Namibian soldiers _ about 240 men _ were flown to
Luanda, citing information from relatives of the troops.
	   Die Republikein, an Afrikaans-language daily, reported that the
armored attack vehicles were especially outfitted with light
cannons at the Grootfontein Military Base, about 200 kilometers
(124 miles) south of Namibia's arid border with Angola.
	   Editor Christo Retief told The Associated Press he had seen the
work being done on 12 vehicles.
	   ``I'm looking at the pictures right now,'' Retief said.
	   The vehicles carry about 10 soldiers each and were traveling
with a large 25,000-liter diesel tanker, indicating they planned a
long journey, the papers said.
	   The Namibian added that a helicopter was also being transported,
quoting unnamed sources at the Grootfontein base and in the area.
	   Southern and central Africa face the largest threat to stability
in years from the Angolan and Congolese conflicts.
	   Angolan troops on Monday drove Congolese rebel forces from a
string of Atlantic coast towns in a reversal of rebel gains, a
senior Congolese government advisor said in Kinshasa.
	   Namibian officials confirmed that Namibia's top Defense Force
Chief, Lt. Gen. Dimo Hamaambo, was in Luanda, Angola, conferring on
defense matters.
	   ``Yes, that is correct, he is in Luanda. He went up somewhere
over the weekend,'' Defense Force spokesman Vincent Mwange told The
Associated Press.
	   Congolese officials in Pretoria on Monday rejected a cease-fire
proposal brokered by South African President Nelson Mandela,
because it did not demand the withdrawal of Ugandan and Rwandan
troops that Congo claims are backing the rebel movement.

Brazilian capital suffers with desert-dry air
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ A mass of Sahara-dry air has turned
Brazil's capital into a tinderbox, sending brush fires racing
through public gardens and private estates.
	   The humidity has sunk to a desert-low 15 percent in this
high-plains city, the weather bureau said. With temperatures in the
high 80s F. (over 30 C.), any spark can ignite a blaze.
	   On Saturday, a fire broke out at the Botanical Garden ecological
reserve, destroying 375 acres (150 hectares) before firefighters
could put it out the next day.
	   TV film showed mansion owners in the city's fashionable South
Lake zone dipping buckets into their swimming pools to wet down
shrubbery as fires burned nearby.
	   No victims were reported, the fire department said.
	   For the city's 1.5 million residents, the seasonal midyear
dryness often brings headaches, dizziness and nosebleeds.
	   The Brasilia Board of Education on Monday said public schools
may cancel outdoor gym classes in favor of less strenuous
activities in the shade. The Secretary of Health issued an advisory
that children and older citizens should use light clothing, drink
lots of liquids and avoid going outside between 10:30 a.m. and 3:30
p.m.

Officials: Russia's foreign policy to remain unchanged
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ While a government shake-up promises new twists
and turns in Russia's domestic policy, the dismissal of the Cabinet
is unlikely to affect the nation's foreign and defense policies,
officials said Monday.
	   ``As regards Russia's foreign policy, it is determined by
President Yeltsin, and it remains unchanged,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin was quoted as saying by the Interfax
news agency.
	   President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky also
said there would be no surprises in foreign policy.
	   Unlike Russia's economy _ which has has seen many major
upheavals in the past few years, and is the subject of bitter
squabbles between the government and Communist-led opposition _
Russia's foreign policy has remained relatively consistent.
	   Many views, including opposition to NATO expansion and a search
for a greater role in the Mideast and Asia, are shared by both the
government and the opposition.
	   While many top economic officials are expected to lose their
jobs, Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov is likely to keep his
position, as he has in previous shakeups.
	   Primakov, an Arab affairs expert, has proved a valuable asset to
Russia in its negotiations in the Middle East. He notched a major
victory for Russian diplomacy last year when he persuaded Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein to readmit U.N. weapons inspectors, bringing
an apparent end to a three-week standoff.
	   Primakov cut short his vacation at the Black Sea resort of Sochi
on Monday to return to Moscow, and was expected to show up for work
as usual on Wednesday, Foreign Ministry officials said, according
to both the ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies.
	   Meanwhile, Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev met with Yeltsin on
Monday, making what the Russian NTV television station described as
an ``effective pledge of allegiance'' to acting Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin.
	   Under the Russian Constitution, Yeltsin personally appoints
defense, foreign and interior ministers, and he has made no sign
that there will be any replacements.
	   Sergeyev had indicated long before the latest crisis that he
might want to step down. But he made no indication Monday that he
was planning to leave.
	   ``There is a big hope placed on the appointment of Viktor
Stepanovich Chernomyrdin,'' Sergeyev said after the meeting with
Yeltsin. ``There is a hope that we will correct the situation that
has developed today.''

Explosion kills three at Indian railway station
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAUHATI, India (AP) _ A powerful bomb exploded Monday at a
railway station in eastern India, killing three people and injuring
20 others, police said.
	   The bomb exploded on the railway platform as two passenger
trains were pulling out of the station in Gauhati, the capital of
the eastern Assam state, where ethnic rebels are fighting for
independence. Gauhati is 1,450 kilometers (870 miles) east of the
Indian capital New Delhi.
	   Among the 20 injured in the explosion, 15 were reported to be in
serious condition. Police said six of the injured were army
soldiers. One soldier was among the three killed in the explosion.
	   Police said the bomb was triggered by a remote control device
but could not say who was responsible for the blast. No one has
claimed responsibility for the blast.
	   The explosion plunged the entire railway station into darkness.
Police cordoned off the area and were searching for clues.
	   Separatist rebels in Assam are fighting for an independent
homeland for the ethnic Assamese people. Militant groups frequently
carry out bombings and attack government installations to make
public their demands.

Council discussions expected on Sudan's request for technical team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with council holding brief discussions, some
members seeking evidence of U.S. claims, US saying no need for an
investigation because US already has the evidence. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.S. deputy ambassador said Monday it
was unnecessary to send a technical team to investigate U.S. claims
that the Sudanese factory it bombed produced chemical agents for
terrorist groups because Washington already has evidence.
	   ``Putting together a technical team to confirm something that we
already know, based on our own information, doesn't seem to have
any point to us,'' Peter Burleigh said in response to a request for
a U.N. investigation from Sudan and backed by Arab states.
	   The council held preliminary discussions Monday but took no
action. Council president Danilo Turk said future discussions were
possible after members ``reflect on this matter.''
	   ``I understand that one of the needs that was very much on the
minds of the members was to get additional information,'' he said.
``And that would be part of this process.''
	   The United States launched a cruise missile attack Thursday on
the Khartoum plant, and a simultaneous strike against extremist
camps in Afghanistan, in retaliation for the Aug. 7 bombings of
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Washington says the El Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co. plant
and the Afghanistan camps were linked to Osama bin Laden, whom U.S.
officials suspect in the embassy blasts.	   Sudan says the pharmaceutical plant produced half of the
country's medicines and vaccines, including antibiotics and drugs
for diseases like malaria and tuberculosis. Washington says the
plant also produced an ingredient for the deadly nerve gas VX.
	   China's deputy ambassador, Shen Guofang, said his government
wanted evidence that the plant was indeed used for developing
chemical agents.
	   ``We hope that the United States will give some strong evidence
to prove that this factory produced some poison gas for
terrorism,'' he said.
	   Burleigh said the United States would consider providing
governments with evidence but cautioned that Washington would have
to first decide what information it could and could not release.
	   When asked if an independent U.N. investigation wouldn't
strengthen the U.S. case, Burleigh said: ``There's no doubt about
the credibility of the evidence that the U.S. government has.''
	   Sudan requested the technical investigation and an urgent
council meeting in a letter to Turk on Friday.
	   It asked the council to ``take its responsibility under the
Charter of the United Nations by condemning this barbarous and
iniquitous aggression and holding the United States of America
responsible for all the material damage and human casualties of
this aggression.''
	   It called the U.S. strikes a ``clear and blatant violation of
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a member state.''

Eight climbers dead, three seriously injured on Mont Blanc
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Eight climbers have died and three others
were gravely injured in falls on Mont Blanc in the past two days,
after rain left much of the Europe's highest mountain dangerously
slick, authorities said Monday.
	   A German father and son fell several hundred meters (yards) to
their deaths Monday after a Hungarian climber about 50 years old
suffered a fatal fall in the same area Sunday, authorities said.
	   Another climber had died Aug. 11 there, the traditional access
to the summit of Mont Blanc via the Dome du Gouter, usually
considered a trouble-free route, authorities said on customary
anonymity.
	   A rescue helicopter sighted three other bodies, believed to be
those of three missing Italian climbers, while it picked up two
other men.
	   A French man and woman also died in separate accidents when
pitons dislodged released their ropes. The woman's male companion
and the man's brother were gravely injured.
	   Another climber, whose nationality was not immediately known,
was seriously injured after falling at the Dome du Gouter at an
altitude of 4,400 meters (14,400 feet).
	   On the mountain la Meije, authorities reported the death of an
18-year-old French male climber before dawn Monday.
	   Mont Blanc, at the borders of France and Italy, is Europe's
highest mountain at 4,800 meters (15,750 feet).

SairGroup determined to offset impact of Asian financial crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ SAirGroup, parent of national airline
Swissair, is determined to take action to offset the impact of
Asian financial turmoil, the group's chairman and chief executive
said Monday.
	   The company has put in place measures to offset setbacks in the
Asian market, including strengthening other airline routes, such as
those to San Francisco, New York and Johannesburg.
	   It would like to acquire a slice of the French airline AOM,
President Philippe Bruggisser said in a letter to shareholders.
SAirGroup expects to know more about this prospect by the end of
this year, he said.
	   The company also has a game plan to deal with any possible
downturn in the airline sector.
	   ``We are confident of taking effective action to offset the
impact of the Asian crisis,'' chairman Hannes Goetz and Bruggisser
said.
	   The company expects the current positive trends it is
experiencing to continue for the rest of the year, Goetz and
Bruggisser said. The group Thursday reported a 17 percent rise in
net profit to 109 million Swiss francs (dlrs 72.6 million) in the
first half of 1998. The firm said some parts of its business, which
also includes catering operations and hotels, were hit by the
economic problems in Asia.
	   But at a news conference later, company officials played down
the impact of the Asian turmoil.
	   The impact of Asia's troubles shaved 140 million Swiss francs
(dlrs 93 million) from group revenues in the first half, when the
company still reported an 11 percent rise to 5.4 billion Swiss
francs (dlrs 3.6 billion) from a year earlier.

Human rights group says 31 `disappeared' in Egypt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A human rights group said Monday it has
documented 31 cases of people who ``disappeared'' in Egypt since
1992, many of them suspected militants taken into police custody.
	   The group, the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, said its
study had been forwarded to the U.N. Working Group on Involuntary
Disappearance.
	   ``All these disappearances are very dangerous violations of
human rights in Egypt,'' said Hafez Abu-Siida, secretary-general of
the EOHR.
	   He said the group continued ``to put pressure on the Ministry of
Interior and the prosecutor general to obtain information'' about
the missing.
	   The group based its study on field investigations as well as
information from relatives and lawyers of the missing people.
	   The report said 23 of the missing were suspected of belonging to
Muslim militant groups or were accused of giving refuge to
extremists. And it said 14 of the cases involved people who
disappeared in Minya province, which is 220 kilometers (135 miles)
south of Cairo.
	   Police have made numerous arrests in Minya, which has been a
hotbed of activity by Islamic extremists who have waged a campaign
of violence since the spring of 1992 to try to overthrow Egypt's
secular government and replace it with strict Islamic rule.
	   Naela Gabr, the Foreign Ministry official responsible for human
rights monitoring, said she ``gives the EOHR reports serious
attention'' but could not respond because the group does not have
legal status in Egypt.
	   The group has been seeking legal status for six years.
	   The report blamed most of the disappearances on ``illegal
procedures taking place during arrests'' as well as detentions in
places that are not under the supervision of public prosecutors. It
did not elaborate.
	   It added that under the nation's emergency law, suspects can be
taken into so-called administrative detention. They can be held
this way without contact with family or lawyers for up to 30 days.
	   The group called on the government to investigate the
whereabouts of the 31 missing persons ``and put an end to the crime
of involuntary disappearance.''

Sierra Leone journalists, civilians found guilty of treason
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Sixteen Sierra Leoneans, including
five former journalists, were convicted of treason Monday for
collaborating with the West African country's ousted military
junta.
	   A 12-member jury announced the verdict after several days of
deliberations behind closed doors. Two of the 18 people charged
were found not guilty.
	   A judge is expected to hand down penalties _ likely death by
hanging _ on Tuesday after hearing pleas for mercy from the
defendants' lawyers.
	   The convicted journalists, who were accused of assisting junta
troops during an armed coup d'etat in May last year, are former
British Broadcasting Corporation announcer Hilton Fyle, Sierra
Leone state radio executive Gipu Felix George, radio journalists
Dennis Smith and Olivia Mensah and newspaper editor Ibrahim Ben
Kargbo.
	   Former junta spokesman Alieu Kamara was also found guilty.
	   The remaining people convicted included Sierra Leonean
businessmen and government bureaucrats.
	   The convictions are the first under President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah's recently-restored government, which has pursued treason
cases against at least 40 other civilians in separate court cases
and 38 soldiers who are being court martialled.
	   One of the country's foremost warlords, former rebel leader
Foday Sankoh, also faces charges for crimes against humanity.
	   Kabbah was forced into exile in May last year during the coup
led by Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma, who was himself driven from the
capital 10 months later by Nigerian-led West African intervention
forces, paving the way for Kabbah's return in March.
	   Junta and allied rebel forces continue to kill, rape and maim
villagers as part of their campaign against the government and have
threatened mass killings in retaliation against the jailing of
Sankoh and other rebels.

Bangladesh appeals for international help to deal with floods
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details and background about floods. &QL; 
 &UR; AP photo planned &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Bangladesh appealed Monday for
international help to deal with a devastating flood that has caused
550 deaths and disrupted the lives of 20 million people.
	   Since the floods began last month, all the country's rivers
overflowed their banks, submerging 60 percent of the land. Crops,
roads, railways and homes were washed away or destroyed. Barring
highways, large parts of the country were under waist-high water.
	   The government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has asked for
assistance to cope with the damage, estimated at dlrs 220 million,
said Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad.
	   The government said it lacked food, medicine. Also needed were
funds to reclaim agricultural land, for housing material, to
rebuild and repair schools, for roads and rail tracks, and for
dredging rivers.
	   More than 130,000 people whose homes were swept away in the
floods are living in temporary shelters. Schools are closed and
attendance at work has dropped by at least 30 percent since floods
began.
	   Some 100,000 people were ill with diarrhea and at least 65 had
died from water borne diseases. Nearly 3,500 paramedics were
working in flood hit areas to control diseases caused by
contaminated water.
	   Weather experts said the flooding may continue until the middle
of September when the seasonal monsoon rains end.
	   Bangladesh, a delta region, is plagued by floods and other
natural disaster every year that claim many lives and cause
widespread damage.

UN chief welcomes trial in Netherlands for Lockerbie suspects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United States and Britain asked U.N.
chief Kofi Annan on Monday to arrange for the relocation of two
Libyans suspected in the bombing of a Pan Am flight over Scotland
for a proposed trial in the Netherlands, a U.N. spokesman said.
	   Annan welcomed the proposal and ``hopes that all sides will
cooperate in order to reach an early resolution to this
longstanding issue,'' spokesman Fred Eckhard said Monday after the
United States and Britain announced they had agreed to allow two
Libyans charged in the bombing to be tried by a Scottish court in
the Netherlands.
	   The U.S. deputy ambassador, Peter Burleigh, and the British
deputy representative, Stephen Gomersall, delivered a letter to the
deputy secretary-general informing the United Nations of the
decision.
	   The two diplomats asked Annan, who is vacationing in Ghana, to
relay the letter and additional information about the proposal to
Libya and provide Libya with ``any assistance it might require'' to
transfer the two men.
	   U.S. officials said U.N. sanctions against Libya would be
suspended once the two Libyans are delivered to the Netherlands.
The sanctions include an air embargo, arms sales and certain
financial and travel restrictions.
	   The Pan Am bombing killed all 259 passengers and crew, and 11
people on the ground in Lockerbie, Scotland.

Yeltsin's firings at least bring some light moments
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Politics &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ When Russia's prime minister and one of his
deputies found out they had been fired, they brought bottles of
vodka to miners who have been striking under the windows of their
government offices for three months.
	   ``They're normal guys,'' Grigory Isayev, a 55-year-old security
guard, said of Sergei Kiriyenko and Boris Nemtsov, though the pair
had been targets of ire the day before. ``They're nobody now,
they're just like us. They came to apologize and said `Hey, let's
drink.'''
	   The scene was one of the many theatrical sideshows that followed
Yeltsin's abrupt decision to dismiss his entire government Monday,
only five months after he'd done the exact same thing.
	   The power vacuum created an opportunity for some of Russia's
political leaders. Few, if any, seized on the moment as quickly as
the bombastic nationalist, Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
	   Zhirinovsky, a Duma deputy and the leader of the Liberal
Democratic Party of Russia, said Viktor Chernomyrdin, the new prime
minister who was booted from the same post five months ago, should
make him a deputy prime minister.
	   ``We will work in a new team of doctors who will save the
patient,'' Zhirinovsky told the Interfax news agency.
``Chernomyrdin should put us in charge of a hospital department of
our own.''
	   Zhirinovsky said he would take any deputy ministerial post
available.
	   Unsatisfied with a handful of ministers' heads, the miners
outside the government building still called for Yeltsin's
resignation, even though the shakeup has left the country with few
top officials to speak of.
	   ``Yeltsin will be overthrown,'' said Isayev, the security
officer. ``The government is bankrupt and there will be a
revolution.''
	   Others formulated hypotheses full of political intrigue around
the ``new old'' prime minister, as one news program called
Chernomyrdin.
	   The newspaper Vremya said Chernomyrdin would ``consolidate the
party elite, thinking he can gather around him `party power' and
block up the opposition, making it submit early to his victory in
2000 (presidential elections).''
	   Chernomyrdin, considered bland and uncharismatic, is seen as a
long shot for the vote.
	   Further away, Yeltsin's shakeup brought a mild slap on the wrist
from the breakaway republic of Chechnya, which has been awash in
violence since a 1994-96 independence war with Russia.
	   ``President Yeltsin has pulled another rabbit our of his hat to
hypnotize the Russian people,'' Chechen Foreign Minister Movladi
Udugov said, according to Interfax. ``(He) has again shown his
unpredictability.''
	   But the Russian people didn't seem hypnotized, instead offering
their own suggestions for Russia's future.
	   ``All those officials are the same,'' said Sergei Anchyukov, a
50-year-old writer. ``If you picked any man off the street and made
him president, he'd be better than Yeltsin.''

Rebels kill seven, wound five in bus attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) _ Hutu rebels killed seven people and
wounded another five in an attack on a bus in southern Bururi
province, military sources said Monday.
	   They said the rebels attacked a bus on Sunday in Rumonge
commune, about 75 kilometers (50 miles) south of Bujumbura. Five
people were killed on the spot, and two more died in hospital.
	   All five of the wounded are in critical condition.
	   It was unclear what kind of weapons were used, and no additional
information was immediately available.
	   Hutu rebels have been operating in Burundi since 1993 after
Tutsi paratroopers assassinated the the country's first Hutu
president.
	   Since then, at least 200,000 people have been killed, most of
them civilians either targeted or caught in the crossfire between
the Tutsi army and rebels.
	   The rebels are fighting now to oust President Pierre Buyoya, a
Tutsi former military officer who took control in a bloodless coup
in July 1996.
	   Although Tutsis only make up 14 percent of Burundi's population
of 6 million, they have controlled the country for all but four
months since independence from Belgium in 1962. Hutus make up 85
percent of the population.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ While Russians wondered aloud whether their
government was out of control, President Boris Yeltsin said Monday
he had reinstated his old prime minister because the country needed
a ``heavyweight'' at the helm.
	   Yeltsin also hinted that he expected Viktor Chernomyrdin, back
on top as acting prime minister, to be Russia's next president. But
a Kremlin spokesman refused to rule out the possibility that
Yeltsin would run again.
	   ``You ask the president,'' Sergei Yastrzhembsky said at a news
conference when asked if Yeltsin was bowing out.
	   Yeltsin dismissed his entire government on Sunday, including
young Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, and called back his old
subordinate, Chernomyrdin.
	   The abrupt change inspired inspired a wealth of rumors.
Communist Party Chairman Gennady Zyuganov predicted that Yeltsin
would resign within the next few weeks for health reasons, Interfax
reported.
	   Yeltsin has appeared tired at times lately, despite a 5-week
vacation that ended Monday. Although there is no indication that he
has been ill recently, he has a history of heart trouble and
members of his own staff have expressed concerns about his health.
	   Chernomyrdin began his new stint as premier by meeting with
parliamentary leaders and asking them to set aside a package of
economic austerity measures demanded by international lenders. He
said he wanted to study them before asking parliament to approve
them, Russian news agencies said.
	   Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov said Chernomyrdin also agreed to
consider the formation of a coalition government with leading
parliamentary factions. The Communist Party is the largest faction
in the Duma.
	   Russians appear to be growing increasingly tired of the chaos in
the Kremlin, where scarcely a month passes without Yeltsin firing a
high-ranking official. The entire government has been dismissed
twice this year.
	   ``Our country has everything but a brain,'' grumbled Alexander
Yumka, the manager of a Moscow construction company, in a typical
street-level assessment.
	   ``I personally feel ashamed,'' said Galina Velikzhanena, a
retiree pushing a baby stroller through a park. ``Our leaders can't
even put two words together. They can't even speak the language
grammatically.''
	   Yeltsin went on national television to explain, slowly and
glumly, the decisions he had announced in a terse statement on
Sunday. While he praised the ousted prime minister, the 36-year-old
Kiriyenko, he said the situation in the country demanded more
experienced hands at the wheel.
	   ``Today we need those whom we call heavyweights,'' he said. ``I
consider Chernomyrdin's experience and weight essential.''
	   The 60-year-old Chernomyrdin, a physically large man who
resembles Germany's Helmut Kohl, was ousted in March in favor of
Kiriyenko. At the time, Yeltsin said the country needed ``fresh
ideas and unorthodox approaches'' to tackle its deepening problems.
	   But Kiriyenko spent his five months in office trying to plug
leaks in a crumbling ceiling that finally came crashing down last
week, when he was forced to effectively devalue the national
currency, the ruble. If he had fresh ideas, he never had a chance
to implement them.
	   ``When you have a fire in your house, you don't think about how
to rebuild it, you just try to save it,'' said Yevgeny Volk, a
political analyst with the Heritage Foundation in Moscow. He added
that he considered the appointment of Chernomyrdin to be
``cosmetic.''
	   ``Unfortunately, the roots of the Russian financial problems are
too deep, and remain in the nature of the unreformed economy. ... I
don't expect a rapid improvement,'' he said.
	   Yastrzhembsky, Yeltsin's spokesman, agreed that ``the overall
economic course will be unchanged.''
	   Chernomyrdin has not yet said what he intends to do. ``The first
thing I will do as acting head of government is to analyze the
situation on Russia's financial and stock markets,'' Chernomyrdin
was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   He faces a disastrous economic situation, in which the ruble's
value is sinking, Russia's banks are teetering on the brink of
collapse and foreign investors are fleeing the stock and money
markets in droves.
	   The ruble dropped 0.135 against the U.S. dollar on the interbank
currency exchange on Monday, to close sharply down at 7.14 rubles
to the dollar.
	   Stocks rallied, however, closing up 6.3 percent in light
trading. Gazprom, the national gas monopoly that Chernomyrdin used
to head, soared 24 percent.
	   Yeltsin's statements about Chernomyrdin are sure to set off a
fresh round of political speculation.
	   The president said he was acting, in part, ``to ensure
continuity of the government in the year 2000. Viktor Stepanovich's
main advantages are decency, honesty, and thoroughness. I think
these qualities will be the decisive argument in the presidential
elections.''
	   Although it sounded like an endorsement, few people believe
Yeltsin has given up on the idea of running for another term
himself. And, given Yeltsin's popularity, which rarely rises above
5 percent in polls, his endorsement could well be the political
kiss of death.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.S. deputy ambassador said Monday it
was unnecessary to send a technical team to investigate U.S. claims
that the Sudanese factory it bombed produced chemical agents for
terrorist groups because Washington already has evidence.
	   ``Putting together a technical team to confirm something that we
already know, based on our own information, doesn't seem to have

Israel softens position on key issue, progress on pullback seen

ADDS Ross comments in graf 6 &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A deal on an Israeli troop withdrawal
seemed closer Monday, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
reportedly dropping a key precondition to an agreement and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat warming to Israeli ideas.
	   Palestinian negotiators confirmed Israel has softened its
position but said that differences were still unresolved regarding
an American proposal for an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13
percent of the West Bank.
	   Netanyahu's aide, David Bar-Illan said that Israel was
``considering the American ideas of 13 percent if they are divided
into two parts,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   In Oslo, Norway, for a ceremony marking the fifth anniversary of
the first peace accord between the two sides, Arafat called the
Israeli proposal ``a beginning.''
	   Also attending the ceremony were negotiations from both sides
who were expected to meet with U.S. peace envoy to the Middle East,
Dennis Ross to discuss the remaining details of an agreement.
	   At a news conference after the ceremony, Ross said gaps between
the sides had narrowed, but refuse to discuss details. ``We won't
have a breakthrough until we have an agreement,'' Ross said.
	   One stumbling block to an agreement had been Israel's insistence
that the Palestinians convene the 545-member Palestine National
Council to remove ambiguity about whether it had canceled clauses
in the PLO charter which call for Israel's destruction.
	   Palestinians have maintained the PNC already took action to
revoke the charter. A senior Israeli official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said that Israel told U.S. negotiators that
it would now agree to start the withdrawal process without a new
meeting.
	   The official said Israel was now willing to accept a statement
from the smaller PLO executive committee that it would reconvene
the PNC within the four-month period of phased pullbacks.
	   Netanyahu's office denied an Israeli newspaper report that the
premier had reversed his stand on the PLO charter, saying that
Netanyahu told U.S. President Bill Clinton in a telephone
conversation Friday that amending the charter ``is a basic
condition of the agreement with the Palestinians.''
	   In the tensely divided West Bank city of Hebron, where a
prominent rabbi was killed last week by a Palestinian assailant,
Israel troops enforced a curfew in the downtown area for a fourth
day and fired rubber bullets at Palestinian stone throwers.
	   About a dozen Palestinian children threw stones from rooftops
onto Israeli soldiers in the streets below. Troops fired two rounds
of rubber bullets towards the protesters. There were no reports of
injuries.
	   Twelve Palestinians were also detained after they broke curfew
and lined up by troops for identity checks. The army eased a siege
over the city however, permitting some 6,000 workers and merchants
to leave town and get to jobs in Israel.
	   Meanwhile, a group of 11 hardliners in Netanyahu's coalition,
known as the Greater Land of Israel Front, threatened to topple the
government if Israel cedes the additional 13 percent of West Bank
land to Palestinians control.
	   ``We are holding this meeting to signal to the prime minister,
in case he has a short memory, that his coalition will not allow
him to do something against the wishes of the people who elected
him,'' Michael Kleiner, head of the group and a member of the
Gesher Party, told the AP.
	   Netanyahu controls 61 of 120 seats in parliament, and the
Kleiner group could topple him.
	   Palestinian officials said a new, exploratory channel had been
opened between Netanyahu confidant Yitzhak Molcho, and Ahmed
Qureia, the speaker of the Palestinian legislative council. They
also said Israel was backing away from previous positions.
	   ``The Israelis called us and said we have something new we want
to show you. They said, `we have abandoned our demand for the
convening of the PNC' and said that they are willing to withdraw
from 13 percent ...,'' said Nabil Shaath, a minister in Arafat's
Cabinet and a top negotiator.
	   Bar-Illan said that the 13 percent would need to be divided into
two parts, with 3 percent turned into a nature reserve where the
Palestinians would not be allowed to maintain a police presence of
build.
	   In Norway Monday, Arafat said that he could accept an agreement
which handed over existing nature reserves to Palestinian control,
but his aides said that the Palestinians still reject a deal which
would create a new reserve out of land slated for withdrawal.

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ In the latest confession of doping from former
East German sports figures, the former national women's swim team
coach admitted in court Monday that he secretly gave his athletes
banned performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Rolf Glaeser, 58, who has worked as a coach in Austria since
1990, also apologized to his former swimmers, including 1980
Olympic medalist Christiane Sommer, who won the medal under her
maiden name, Knacke.
	   Sommer testified against Glaeser during the trial, and said
after his confession that she wasn't sure how to react, but
suspected Glaeser was hoping to reduce his sentence.
	   Following the confession, Glaeser's case was severed from his
co-defendants, all of whom are charged with causing bodily harm for
administering steroids to minors.
	   The charge carries a maximum of three years in prison, but other
coaches and sports doctors similarly charged received only fines
last week after confessing in a separate trial.
	   Glaeser coached the showcase Dynamo Berlin team from 1971-1984.
He told the court he first got the pink and blue pills in 1976 from
a co-defendant, Dr. Dinus Binus, who told him they helped muscle
regeneration.
	   He insisted he was not informed about possible dangers, and said
he never linked the side-effects he saw, such as acne or weight
gain, to the drugs.
	   Glaeser mentioned an interview during the 1976 Montreal
Olympics, when he was asked about his team's deep voices, and he
replied they were there to swim, not sing.
	   After coming home, he said he was told his young charges were
getting over colds. ``Today I reproach myself for not questioning
that,'' he said.
	   Binus confessed last month to a role in East Germany's
systematic doping. Verdicts in his and Glaeser's cases are expected
next Monday.
	   A second doctor and three other coaches on trial have refused to
make any statements.

Economic policy put on ice while acting premier studies course
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's economic policy was put on hold Monday
while the new acting prime minister studied the government's
course, including an eagerly awaited announcement on debt
restructuring.
	   Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin also asked the State
Duma, the lower house of parliament, to set aside ``for the time
being'' a set of economic austerity measures demanded by
international lenders.
	   The government had been expected to announce a debt
restructuring plan on Monday. But Chernomyrdin, appointed to head
the government on Sunday, was tied up in meetings with parliament
and wasn't able to sign off on the plan.
	   ``Everything is on hold because of Chernomyrdin,'' said a
government spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``Everyone is waiting for him.''
	   The plan was originally to have been announced last week, but
the announcement was delayed after foreign investors cried foul,
claiming it favored Russian commercial banks.
	   The plan involves dlrs 40 billion worth of outstanding bond
issues, which are to be swapped for longer-term bonds. More than
dlrs 11 billion of the treasury bills are held by foreign
investors.
	   Overall, it was a discouraging day for international investors.
	   Chernomyrdin gave the Communist-dominated Duma at least a
temporary reprieve on considering the economic austerity measures.
Lawmakers passed some pieces of the austerity package earlier this
summer, but balked on others, including amendments to tax, pension,
and financial insolvency laws.
	   Chernomyrdin said he wanted to study those before asking
parliament to take them up, Russian news agencies reported.
	   The move won approval from the head of the Duma's Budget and
Finance Committee, Alexander Zhukov, who told the ITAR-Tass news
agency that the measures ``do not play a decisive role for
financial stabilization'' anyway.
	   Meanwhile, international creditors to Russian banks got few
reassurances from the Central Bank in talks over the rescheduling
of Russian commercial debt, foreign investors in Moscow said.
	   At the meeting, the Central Bank and Finance Ministry said they
will take on no liabilities from commercial banks.
	   ``There was an agreement to continue talking, but nothing much
happened at this meeting itself,'' said a representative a major
western commercial bank who attended the meeting and spoke on
condition of anonymity.

Statement demands U.S., allies close embassies in Muslim countries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A statement believed to be from a group supporting
extremist leader Osama bin Laden called Monday on all Muslim
nations to order the United States and its allies to shut down
their embassies and to boycott those countries.
	   The International Islamic Front, in a statement faxed to Radio
France Internationale, called on all Muslims ``to respond to the
American aggression and its allies by demanding the closure of
their embassies.''
	   In the wake of U.S. bombings of sites in Afghanistan and Sudan
on Thursday, the group also urged Muslim countries to expel
officials from the United States and its allies, and to impose an
economic boycott on those countries.
	   The Afghan-based group reiterated earlier threats of violent
reprisal by bin Laden supporters for the U.S. air strikes. The U.S.
attacks were in response to the terrorist bombings the week before
against U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 257
people and were linked to bin Laden's group.
	   ``Islam requires us to hunt American, British, French and other
forces from all Muslim countries where they are found,'' said the
statement.
	   ``Just as it requires us to liberate all the Muslim countries
with miscreant regimes and their governments that are valets for
the impious states, with the United States at their head,'' it
added.
	   The International Islamic Front, established in 1990 by a
Syrian-born militant now living in Afghanistan, supports the World
Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders, the group
founded by bin Laden, an exiled Saudi millionaire.

Thousands protest arrest of six former top officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Thousands of Albanians gathered in the
streets of the capital late Monday, protesting the arrest of six
former top government officials charged with crimes against
humanity.
	   Roughly 3,000 people, led by former President Sali Berisha,
convened in Skenderbeg Square, whistling and shouting, ``Down with
Communism'' in support of six members of Berisha's Democratic Party
who were arrested Sunday. They were charged with crimes against
humanity in the chaos that followed the collapse of pyramid schemes
last year.
	   Addressing the crowd Monday, Berisha called the government of
Socialist Premier Fatos Nano ``criminal'' and called on the crowd
to ``destroy their government.''
	   ``Death to their tyranny and death to the criminals and down
with the parliament and the government,'' Berisha told the crowd.
The protesters massed in the streets of downtown Tirana for about
an hour, before proceeding to the front of Nano's residence and
slowly dispersing.
	   No incidents were immediately reported.
	   Nano's socialist government was voted into power in July 1997,
months after public discontent following the collapse of pyramid
schemes, in which most Albanians lost their life savings, led to
insurgency that caused more than 2,000 people to lose their lives.
	   In addition to former Defense Minister Safet Zhulali, former
deputy chief of the secret service Bujar Rama and former Interior
Minister Halit Shamata were arrested.
	   The other three were the State Control Minister Blerim Cela;
Sokol Mulosmanaj, the police chief of Vlora, the town where the
anti-government actions started last year, and an army commander,
Kreshnik Lusha.
	   They are charged with crimes against humanity that resulted in
the destruction of the Albanian state and the deaths of thousands
of people.
	   Also Moncay, a Tirana military court ruled the six should remain
in custody while awaiting trial. No date has been set for the
trial. If convicted they could face life in prison.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo rejected a proposed cease-fire on
Monday as its allies recaptured rebel strongholds, including the
port of Matadi in the country's west, and rival Ugandan troops were
seen deploying in the northeast.
	   Information Minister Didier Mumengi said Congolese and allied
Angolan forces had retaken Matadi, the only key port town on the
Congo River supplying the capital, Kinshasa.
	   What began three weeks ago as an armed rebellion against
President Laurent Kabila has now drawn three of Congo's neighbors _
Rwanda and Uganda for the rebels and Angola for the government _
into the conflict. Zimbabwe has also sent troops to shore up
government defenses.
	   Although Uganda and Rwanda both deny involvement in the war, at
least 500 Ugandan troops, two tanks and anti-aircraft guns were
spotted Sunday by a British tourist about 170 kilometers (105
miles) inside Congolese territory.
	   At least 2,000 Angolan and 600 Zimbabwean troops are now in the
country, a ministry-level government official said on condition of
anonymity.
	   Rwanda is believed to be the main sponsor of the rebel movement
_ a coalition of ethnic Tutsis and former members of Kabila's
military.
	   Efforts in South Africa to halt the fighting were blocked when
Congolese government officials rejected a cease-fire proposed by
President Nelson Mandela.
	   Mandela convened the talks as head of the 14-member Southern
African Development Community.
	   ``What we have said all along is that this rebellion is an
invasion by Rwanda and Uganda,'' said Ferdinand Mwana Naga, the
agriculture minister and one of Kabila's closest confidants. ``We
cannot stop fighting until those foreign aggressors are gone.''
	   Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo, Kabila's envoy at the talks in
Pretoria, said his government would allow foreign troops to leave
the country unfettered.
	   ``Congo will refrain from attacking the withdrawing troops,''
Kongolo said.
	   The call for a cessation of hostilities came after Angolan
forces in Congo's southwestern Atlantic Ocean corridor retook a
string of coastal towns in a stunning reversal of rebel gains.
	   Angolans are now in control of the oil port town of Muanda and
the nearby town of Banana.

Israel softens position on key issue, progress on pullback seen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS Lead. UPDATES throughout with new details; Arafat,
Ross comments &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A deal on an Israeli troop withdrawal
from the occupied West Bank seemed closer Monday, with Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly dropping a key precondition
to an agreement and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat warming to
Israeli ideas.
	   Palestinian negotiators confirmed Israel has softened its
position but said that differences were still unresolved regarding
an American proposal for an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13
percent of the West Bank.
	   Netanyahu's aide, David Bar-Illan said that Israel was
``considering the American ideas of 13 percent if they are divided
into two parts,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   In Oslo, Norway, for a ceremony marking the fifth anniversary of
the first peace accord between the two sides, Arafat called the
Israeli proposal ``a beginning.''
	   Also attending the ceremony were negotiators from both sides who
were expected to meet with U.S. peace envoy to the Middle East
Dennis Ross to discuss the remaining details of an agreement.
	   At a news conference after the ceremony, Ross said gaps between
the sides had narrowed, but refused to discuss details. ``We won't
have a breakthrough until we have an agreement,'' Ross said.
	   One stumbling block to an agreement had been Israel's insistence
that the Palestinians convene the 545-member Palestine National
Council to remove ambiguity about whether it had canceled clauses
in the PLO charter which call for Israel's destruction.
	   Palestinians have maintained the PNC already took action to
revoke the charter. A senior Israeli official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said that Israel told U.S. negotiators that
it was now willing to accept a statement from the smaller PLO
executive committee that it would reconvene the PNC within the
four-month period of phased pullbacks.
	   Netanyahu's office denied an Israeli newspaper report that the
premier had reversed his stand on the PLO charter, saying that
Netanyahu told U.S. President Bill Clinton in a telephone
conversation Friday that amending the charter ``is a basic
condition of the agreement with the Palestinians.''
	   In the tensely divided West Bank city of Hebron, where a
prominent rabbi was killed last week by a Palestinian assailant,
Israel troops enforced a curfew in the downtown area for a fourth
day and fired rubber bullets at Palestinian stone throwers.
	   About a dozen Palestinian children threw stones from rooftops
onto Israeli soldiers in the streets below. Troops fired two rounds
of rubber bullets at the protesters. There were no reports of
injuries.
	   Twelve Palestinians were also detained after they broke curfew.
The army loosened its control over the city however, permitting
some 6,000 workers and merchants to leave town and get to jobs in
Israel.
	   Meanwhile, a group of 11 hardliners in Netanyahu's coalition,
known as the Greater Land of Israel Front, threatened to topple the
government if Israel cedes the additional 13 percent of West Bank
land to Palestinian control.
	   Netanyahu controls 61 of 120 seats in parliament, and the
hardliners could topple him.
	   Palestinian officials said a new, exploratory channel had been
opened between Netanyahu confidant Yitzhak Molcho, and Ahmed
Qureia, the speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council. They
also said Israel was backing away from previous positions.
	   ``The Israelis called us and said we have something new we want
to show you. They said, `we have abandoned our demand for the
convening of the PNC' and said that they are willing to withdraw
from 13 percent ...,'' said Nabil Shaath, a minister in Arafat's
Cabinet and a top negotiator.
	   Bar-Illan said that the 13 percent would need to be divided into
two parts, with 3 percent turned into a nature reserve where the
Palestinians would not be allowed to maintain a police presence of
build.
	   In Norway Monday, Arafat said that he could accept an agreement
which handed over existing nature reserves to Palestinian control,
but his aides said that the Palestinians still reject a deal which
would create a new reserve out of land slated for withdrawal.

U.S. wants to boost agricultural sales to Egypt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TAREK EL-TABLAWY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The chairman of the agriculture committee in
the U.S. Congress said Monday that the United States wants to boost
its farm sales to Egypt.
	   Rep. Robert Smith, a Republican from Oregon, told a news
conference here that the United States is ``in direct competition
with the European Union for the Egyptian market place.''
	   He said that American wheat sales to Egypt dropped ``from a
market share of 80 percent to 50 percent'' and added: ``We'd like
to improve that.''
	   Smith said that the United States has a credit program aimed at
encouraging Egyptian entrepreneurs in the agricultural sector.
	   ``We're here to trade,'' said Smith. ``We want to improve our
percentage and improve our opportunities with Egypt.''
	   In addition to wheat, the United States also is a major supplier
of corn and soybeans to Egypt.
	   Smith and other members of the agriculture committee met with a
number of Egyptian officials, including President Hosni Mubarak,
over the past three days to talk about boosting U.S.-Egyptian trade
and promoting investment in Egypt.
	   The delegation also visited Egypt's ground-breaking Toshka
project. It involves a canal and a spillway off Lake Nasser in
southern Egypt to irrigate some 1.2 million hectares (3 million
acres) of desert land.
	   Egypt hopes it's ``New Valley'' will draw foreign investment to
help in the creation of communities to lure people from the
overcrowded Nile Valley.
	   Smith said that while the project was ``impressive,'' it
appeared to be in early development states.
	   ``On first impression, the project must mature,'' he said.
	   Smith said he suggested that Egyptian officials visit the United
States this fall to explain the project to potential investors
there.
	   ``Its an ambitious program and we're looking forward to seeing
it mature,'' Smith said.

Lebed: Russia needs new post for troubled Caucasus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Retired Gen. Alexander Lebed urged the Russian
government Monday to appoint a representative to the troubled
northern Caucasus region, a news agency reported.
	   Lebed's comments came in response to a car bombing that took the
life of the Muslim leader of Dagestan, one of the Russian regions
in the north Caucasus that have been plagued by violence and
lawlessness in recent years.
	   He said the situation in the region was deteriorating and that
the government should create a new post of ``plenipotentiary
representative ... and give him the broadest powers possible,'' the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Lebed, recently elected governor of the Krasnoyarsk territory in
Siberia, was raised in southern Russia, near the Caucasus region,
and has long taken an interest in it.
	   He recently was elected head of a peacekeeping organization he
founded in southern Russia.

Yeltsin's firings at least bring some light moments
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to CORRECT day to Sunday, sted Monday &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Politics &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ When Russia's prime minister and one of his
deputies found out they had been fired, they brought bottles of
vodka to miners who have been striking under the windows of their
government offices for three months.
	   ``They're normal guys,'' Grigory Isayev, a 55-year-old security
guard, said of Sergei Kiriyenko and Boris Nemtsov, though the pair
had been targets of ire the day before. ``They're nobody now,
they're just like us. They came to apologize and said `Hey, let's
drink.'''
	   The scene was one of the many theatrical sideshows that followed
Yeltsin's abrupt decision to dismiss his entire government Sunday,
only five months after he'd done the exact same thing.
	   The power vacuum created an opportunity for some of Russia's
political leaders. Few, if any, seized on the moment as quickly as
the bombastic nationalist, Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
	   Zhirinovsky, a Duma deputy and the leader of the Liberal
Democratic Party of Russia, said Viktor Chernomyrdin, the new prime
minister who was booted from the same post five months ago, should
make him a deputy prime minister.
	   ``We will work in a new team of doctors who will save the
patient,'' Zhirinovsky told the Interfax news agency.
``Chernomyrdin should put us in charge of a hospital department of
our own.''
	   Zhirinovsky said he would take any deputy ministerial post
available.
	   Unsatisfied with a handful of ministers' heads, the miners
outside the government building still called for Yeltsin's
resignation, even though the shakeup has left the country with few
top officials to speak of.
	   ``Yeltsin will be overthrown,'' said Isayev, the security
officer. ``The government is bankrupt and there will be a
revolution.''
	   Others formulated hypotheses full of political intrigue around
the ``new old'' prime minister, as one news program called
Chernomyrdin.
	   The newspaper Vremya said Chernomyrdin would ``consolidate the
party elite, thinking he can gather around him `party power' and
block up the opposition, making it submit early to his victory in
2000 (presidential elections).''
	   Chernomyrdin, considered bland and uncharismatic, is seen as a
long shot for the vote.
	   Further away, Yeltsin's shakeup brought a mild slap on the wrist
from the breakaway republic of Chechnya, which has been awash in
violence since a 1994-96 independence war with Russia.
	   ``President Yeltsin has pulled another rabbit our of his hat to
hypnotize the Russian people,'' Chechen Foreign Minister Movladi
Udugov said, according to Interfax. ``(He) has again shown his
unpredictability.''
	   But the Russian people didn't seem hypnotized, instead offering
their own suggestions for Russia's future.
	   ``All those officials are the same,'' said Sergei Anchyukov, a
50-year-old writer. ``If you picked any man off the street and made
him president, he'd be better than Yeltsin.''

British Gas and Texaco announce natural gas, condensate oil find
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ British Gas and U.S.-owned Texaco
Trinidad Inc. announced Monday a significant offshore find of
natural gas and condensate oil.
	   Initial tests from one gas reservoir indicated the field might
yield 36 million cubic feet (more 1 million cubic meters) of gas a
day and 430 barrels of condensate oil, the companies said in a
statement. The field is 60 miles (100 kilometers) off Trinidad's
east shore.
	   ``It's a significant find,'' said Frank Chapman, executive
director for exploration and production of British Gas.
	   Bruce Applebaum, president of Texaco Exploration, said he was
pleased with the ``rapid turn-around time'' from agreement to
discovery in their partnership with British Gas.
	   He said the gas fields could begin full production in nine
months.
	   As known crude oil reserves decline in Trinidad, the local
economy has been shifting its dependence to the trillions of cubic
feet (meters) of known gas reserves on land and off shore. The gas
is being used in half a dozen petrochemical plants on the island.
	   ``This discovery has placed Texaco and British Gas in an
excellent position to supply the growing demand for gas in this
highly industrialized nation,'' James Lejeune, president of Texaco
Trinidad Inc., said in a statement.

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
commemorated the fifth anniversary of the Oslo Accords that set the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process in motion with a limited approval
of an Israeli offer to withdraw from part of the occupied West
Bank.
	   Arafat told reporters on Monday that he could accept a recent
Israeli proposal to include existing nature reserves as part of the
13 percent of territories from which Israeli troops are to
withdraw.
	   ``I can accept that,'' he said, calling the proposal ``a
beginning.''
	   However, his aides said Arafat will not accept an Israeli
proposal to set aside 3 percent of the land for a new nature
preserve that would prevent Palestinians from settling there.
	   Arafat also said he was willing to meet Netanyahu, as long as
there was a good chance of substantive talks.
	   In 1993, Norway held the secret contacts between Israel and the
PLO that led to mutual recognition and a framework agreement on
Palestinian autonomy.
	   Arafat and former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres each had
one arm around the other's waist as they walked into the Norwegian
Nobel Institute Monday. That is where they were picked for the 1994
Nobel peace prize they shared with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin, who was assassinated the next year.
	   But the peace process has been bogged down since the right-wing
Likud government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took power
from Peres and the Labor Party in May 1996. Netanyahu did not
attend the Oslo ceremonies, saying he was too busy for such
nostalgia.
	   ``The Palestinian people have chose the way of the peace of the
brave,'' said Arafat in a speech to about 200 guests. ``I believe
the majority of the Israeli and the Palestinian people want
peace.''
	   In his speech, Peres said, ``In Oslo, what was the important
thing is that we got a Palestinian partner.'' Peres said he would
do everything he could to see the terms of the accords fulfilled.
	   U.S. Peace Envoy Dennis Ross met representatives from both sides
during celebrations this weekend. He said he could talk with Arafat
to see if was a basis for suggesting renewed talks.
	   Ross said the gap between the Israelis and Palestinians had
narrowed, but refused to discuss details.
	   ``We won't have a breakthrough until we have an agreement,''
said Ross, appearing at a news conference that also included
Arafat, Peres, and Meir Sheetrit, the leader of the Likud coalition
in Israel's Knesset.
	   In his own speech, Sheetrit said the Israeli government is
committed to peace.

Human rights group says 31 `disappeared' in Egypt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A human rights group said Monday it has
documented 31 cases of people who ``disappeared'' in Egypt since
1992, many of them suspected militants taken into police custody.
	   The group, the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, said its
study had been forwarded to the U.N. Working Group on Involuntary
Disappearance.
	   ``All these disappearances are very dangerous violations of
human rights in Egypt,'' said Hafez Abu-Siida, the group's
secretary-general.
	   The group based its study on field investigations as well as
information from relatives and lawyers of the missing people.
	   The report said 23 of the missing were suspected of belonging to
Muslim militant groups or were accused of giving refuge to
extremists.
	   It said 14 of the cases involved people who disappeared in Minya
province, 220 kilometers (135 miles) south of Cairo, where police
have made numerous arrests. The area has been a hotbed of activity
by Islamic extremists who have waged a campaign of violence since
the spring of 1992 to try to overthrow Egypt's secular government
and replace it with strict Islamic rule.
	   Naela Gabr, the Foreign Ministry official responsible for human
rights monitoring, said she ``gives the EOHR reports serious
attention'' but could not respond because the group does not have
legal status in Egypt.
	   The group has been seeking legal status for six years.
	   The report blamed most of the disappearances on ``illegal
procedures taking place during arrests'' as well as detentions in
places that are not under the supervision of public prosecutors. It
did not elaborate.
	   It added that under the nation's emergency law, suspects can be
taken into so-called administrative detention, where they can be
held without contact with family or lawyers for up to 30 days.

Fires continue to rage in Russian Far East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Forest fires continued to rage Monday on more than
250,000 hectares (600,000 acres) of the Russian Far East, despite
brief rains that only slightly lessened their intensity, a news
agency said.
	   The fires are sweeping across mostly unpopulated stretches of
taiga _ a desolate region between the arctic tundra and Russia's
thick coniferous forests _ in the eastern region of Khabarovsk.
	   According to the ITAR-Tass news agency, more than 2,000
firefighters and 500 pieces of equipment have been deployed on the
fire, but they have been forced to concentrate on sparing towns and
industrial plants.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The Spice Girls said Monday they may add ``two new
members to the Spice family'' _ a statement which didn't quite
confirm that two member of the pop group are pregnant.
	   Published reports have said that ``Posh Spice'' Victoria Adams
is expecting a child with her soccer-star boyfriend David Beckham,
and that ``Scray Spice'' Melanie Brown and her man, dancerJimmy
Gulzar, are also expecting.
	   A statement released by the group's publicists said:
	   ``We are sisters and love each other, and love being together as
a band and as friends. We plan to continue on, perhaps adding two
new members to the Spice family.
	   ``Until such a time as we are sure of our news and ready to make
a statement we would like to appeal to people to give us privacy
during this time.''
	   The statement then went on to plug the group's forthcoming album
and two British concert dates.

Economic policy put on ice while acting premier studies course
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 5 grafs to UPDATE with Chernomyrdin agreeing to
debt restructuring plan, but no details announced. &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Politics &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's economic policy was put on hold Monday
while the new acting prime minister studied the government's
course, including an eagerly awaited announcement on debt
restructuring.
	   Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin also asked the State
Duma, the lower house of parliament, to set aside ``for the time
being'' a set of economic austerity measures demanded by
international lenders.
	   The government had been expected to announce a debt
restructuring plan on Monday. But Chernomyrdin, appointed to head
the government on Sunday, was tied up in meetings with parliament
and wasn't able to sign off on the plan until late in the day.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency reported early Tuesday that
Chernomyrdin had signed off on the plan, but that details of it
wouldn't be announced until later in the day.
	   ``Everything is on hold because of Chernomyrdin,'' a government
spokesman had said earlier in the day, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``Everyone is waiting for him.''
	   The plan was originally to have been announced last week, but
the announcement was delayed after foreign investors cried foul,
claiming it favored Russian commercial banks.
	   The plan involves dlrs 40 billion worth of outstanding bond
issues, which are to be swapped for longer-term bonds. More than
dlrs 11 billion of the treasury bills are held by foreign
investors.
	   Overall, it was a discouraging day for international investors.
	   Chernomyrdin gave the Communist-dominated Duma at least a
temporary reprieve on considering the economic austerity measures.
Lawmakers passed some pieces of the austerity package earlier this
summer, but balked on others, including amendments to tax, pension,
and financial insolvency laws.
	   Chernomyrdin said he wanted to study those before asking
parliament to take them up, Russian news agencies reported.
	   The move won approval from the head of the Duma's Budget and
Finance Committee, Alexander Zhukov, who told the ITAR-Tass news
agency that the measures ``do not play a decisive role for
financial stabilization'' anyway.
	   Meanwhile, international creditors to Russian banks got few
reassurances from the Central Bank in talks over the rescheduling
of Russian commercial debt, foreign investors in Moscow said.
	   At the meeting, the Central Bank and Finance Ministry said they
will take on no liabilities from commercial banks.
	   ``There was an agreement to continue talking, but nothing much
happened at this meeting itself,'' said a representative a major
western commercial bank who attended the meeting and spoke on
condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Dismissing plots and
threats against his life, Fidel Castro bade farewell to the
Dominican Republic Monday insisting that his communist revolution
will endure long after he is gone.
	   ``Men die. Peoples are immortal,'' the 72-year-old Cuban leader
told a gathering of university students and leftist activists in a
nearly three-hour speech. ``History marches on.''
	   ``I'm not very worried about what will happen in Cuba,'' Castro
told his audience.
	   Castro also referred to the extraordinarily heavy security
surrounding his five-day visit to the Dominican Republic _
motivated by alleged threats in recent weeks by Cuban exiles to
assassinate him here.
	   ``Nervous? Maybe yes,'' he said of official concerns about the
threats.
	   The visit marked the first time in his 39 years as Cuba's leader
that Castro had visited the neighboring Dominican Republic.
	   For decades, Castro was persona non grata here. Fearing another
Cuba in the Caribbean, the United States supported conservative,
anti-Castro governments in the Dominican Republic, and in 1965 U.S.
President Lyndon B. Johnson sent in 40,000 troops to quash a
leftist revolt aimed at returning the Dominican Republic's elected
president to power.
	   In the 1980s, however, Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer
opened trade ties to Cuba. His successor in 1996, Leonel Fernandez,
moved quickly to restore diplomatic relations. A crowning moment in
Castro's visit was a cordial meeting Sunday with the 91-year-old
Balaguer, his old ideological adversary.
	   Dominicans, who despite Balaguer's 24-year rule have a strong
tradition of leftist political activism, embraced Castro. They
recalled his opposition to the hated Dominican dictator Rafael
Trujillo, who ruled with an iron fist from 1930 to his
assassination in 1961.
	   Castro also won a broader welcome here by being admitted as an
observer to a two-day summit of 16 Caribbean nations. Caribbean
leaders no longer view him as a threat and are seeking his help in
negotiating better aid and trade benefits from partners such as the
European Union.
	   Despite the reported threats, there were few local protests of
Castro's visit. Cuban exile organizations published advertisements
in Dominican newspapers condemning Castro's human rights record and
his system as totalitarian.
	   On Monday, Castro recounted failed U.S. efforts to oust him,
ranging from the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1962 to the Helms-Burton
Law designed to scare away foreign investment in Cuba.
	   He even found some humor in Helms-Burton, quipping, ``Who are
the biggest defenders of communism in Cuba? The United States,''
for discouraging capitalist investment.

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
commemorated the fifth anniversary of the Oslo Accords that set the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process in motion with a limited approval
of an Israeli offer to withdraw from part of the occupied West
Bank.
	   Arafat told reporters on Monday that he could accept a recent
Israeli proposal to include existing nature reserves as part of the
13 percent of territories from which Israeli troops are to
withdraw.
	   ``I can accept that,'' he said, calling the proposal ``a
beginning.''
	   However, his aides said Arafat will not accept an Israeli
proposal to set aside 3 percent of the land for a new nature
preserve that would prevent Palestinians from settling there.
	   Arafat also said he was willing to meet Netanyahu, as long as
there was a good chance of substantive talks.
	   In 1993, Norway held the secret contacts between Israel and the
PLO that led to mutual recognition and a framework agreement on
Palestinian autonomy.
	   Arafat and former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres each had
one arm around the other's waist as they walked into the Norwegian
Nobel Institute Monday. That is where they were picked for the 1994
Nobel Peace Prize they shared with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin, who was assassinated the next year.
	   But the peace process has been bogged down since the right-wing
Likud government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took power
from Peres and the Labor Party in May 1996. Netanyahu did not
attend the Oslo ceremonies, saying he was too busy for such
nostalgia.
	   ``The Palestinian people have chose the way of the peace of the
brave,'' said Arafat in a speech to about 200 guests. ``I believe
the majority of the Israeli and the Palestinian people want
peace.''
	   In his speech, Peres said, ``In Oslo, what was the important
thing is that we got a Palestinian partner.'' Peres said he would
do everything he could to see the terms of the accords fulfilled.
	   U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross met representatives from both sides
during celebrations this weekend. He said he could talk with Arafat
to see if there was a basis for suggesting renewed talks.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Arab League on Monday denounced last
week's U.S. military strike against Sudan as an aggression against
an Arab country and gave strong political backing to the Islamic
government in Khartoum.
	   In a resolution following an emergency meeting of its council,
the 22-member league also urged Washington to refrain from any
further actions ``which may arouse public outrage'' in the Arab
world.
	   ``The council decides to condemn the American attack against the
pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum as an aggression against Sudan
and a grave violation of its sovereignty and its territorial
integrity,'' the resolution said.
	   The council, made up of Arab ambassadors to the league, adopted
the resolution unanimously after a two-hour debate. Sudan's
ambassador to the league, Ahmed Abdel-Khalim, is the current
rotating chairman, but this was not believed to have affected the
vote.
	   In Libya on Monday, hundreds of Sudanese demonstrated in front
of U.N. offices in the capital Tripoli to protest the missile
strike on the factory, state-run Libyan television said.
	   The protesters delivered a petition demanding that the United
Nations carry out its responsibilities ``in blocking American
practices that violate international law,'' the TV said.
	   Thousands of Sudanese work in Libya and the two nations _ both
on Washington's list of countries that allegedly sponsor terrorism
_ have strong ties.
	   In Tehran, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called
the missile attacks ``state terrorism,'' Iran's official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
	   Khamenei was quoted as saying in a meeting with President
Mohamad Khatami and his Cabinet that ``I do not know Osama bin
Laden, and I do not condone killing local and civilian people in
Tanzania and Kenya, but the military action of the United States
against Sudan and Afghanistan is as much condemnable as killing
civilians in Kenya and Tanzania.''
	   The United States last Thursday fired missiles at camps in
Afghanistan believed to be run by bin Ladin, a Muslim militant the
Americans blame for the twin bombings on U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania on Aug. 7.
	   The Sudanese factory also was hit Thursday. U.S. officials said
it was linked to bin Laden and was producing ingredients for
chemical weapons. Sudan says it made only medicines.
	   In its statement, the league's council urged ``the United States
as a permanent member of the Security Council and as a superpower
to respect international legitimacy and refrain from these actions
which constitute an aggression against the sovereignty of states.''
	   It also pledged ``material and moral backing to eradicate the
effects of the American strikes and support Sudan in international
organizations.''
	   Sudan also has urged a meeting of the U.N. Security Council to
discuss the air strikes.

Researchers: Liverworts were likely first land plants
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICK CALLAHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Scientists have uncovered the most
persuasive evidence yet that liverworts _ tiny, rootless plants
found in dense forests _ were the first plants to make the leap
from Earth's oceans to dry land.
	   The inch-tall (2.5-centimeter) plants long have been suspected
of being the leafy trailblazers that started the greening of the
Earth and paved the way for sea animals to follow. But with scant
fossil evidence, there was no way scientists could prove an ancient
form of liverworts gave rise to everything from daisies to giant
sequoias.
	   Now, Indiana University researchers have found genetic evidence
that makes the strongest case yet that today's liverworts _ named
for their green, liver-shaped leaves _ are the nearest modern
relatives of the pioneers that left the sea behind about 470
million years ago.
	   Researchers searched the DNA from 352 types of modern plants for
three ancient pieces of genetic material _ called introns _ that
are present in most plants. They found that only liverworts, like
aquatic green algae, lacked all three.
	   That makes the liverworts the closest relative of algae on land
and all but rules out their cousins, the mosses and hornworts, as
candidates for first-on-land honors, concluded Jeffrey Palmer and
his colleagues. The findings were reported in the Aug. 13 issue of
the journal Nature.
	   ``This had been a hypothesis for some time, along with some
competing ideas, but we think our evidence tips the scales in favor
of the liverworts,'' said Palmer, a biology professor.
	   The researchers' findings are important to evolutionary
biologists trying to piece together the early days of land plants,
which acquired the introns missing in liverworts and green algae as
they diversified.
	   Nearly all of the ferns, flowers, trees and other higher plants
the Indiana team examined had at least two of the three introns the
team looked for. Even primitive mosses had at least two.
	   The findings raise the question of what would have happened if
the liverworts had failed to gain a foothold on dry land, said
Peter Crane, a plant paleontologist at the University of Chicago.
	   ``It's a big deal if you think about the colonization of the
Earth. Without that first step, nothing else we are familiar with
would have been possible on land, including of course ourselves,''
said Crane, also the director of Chicago's Field Museum of Natural
History.
	   Liverworts reproduce through a primitive mechanism in which the
plant's sperm must literally swim through dew to reach eggs. Over
millions of years, plants evolved to reproduce through airborne
spores, culminating about 350 million years ago with the rise of
complex seed plants.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo rejected a proposed cease-fire on
Monday as its allied forces captured former rebel strongholds,
including the key Congo River port town of Matadi in the country's
west.
	   Information Minister Didier Mumengi said Congolese and Angolan
forces had retaken Matadi _ the only major port town on the Congo
River.
	   Ugandan troops supporting a rebel army seeking to topple
President Laurent Kabila were seen deploying in the northeast.
	   What began three weeks ago as an armed rebellion against Kabila
has now drawn three of Congo's neighboring countries _ Rwanda and
Uganda for the rebels and Angola for the government _ into the
conflict. Nearby Zimbabwe has also sent troops to shore up
government defenses.
	   Zimbabwean Defense Minister Moven Mahachi was quoted on
Zimbabwean radio Monday saying his forces defending the Congolese
capital's southern outskirts had successfully held off rebel
assaults.
	   ``Zimbabwean troops in the Congolese capital are well trained
and are backed with sophisticated equipment, strong enough to stop
any rebel advance,'' Mahachi was quoted as saying.
	   Uganda and Rwanda both deny involvement in the war, but at least
500 Ugandan troops, two tanks and anti-aircraft guns were spotted
by a British tourist about 170 kilometers (105 miles) inside
Congolese territory.
	   Rwanda is believed to be the main sponsor of the rebel movement
_ a coalition of ethnic Tutsis and former members of Kabila's
military.
	   At least 2,000 Angolan and 600 Zimbabwean troops are also now in
the country, a ministry-level government official said on condition
of anonymity.
	   Efforts in South Africa to halt the fighting were blocked when
Congo's delegate to peace talks there and the government in
Kinshasa rejected a cease-fire proposal made by President Nelson
Mandela.
	   Mandela convened the talks as head of the 14-member Southern
African Development Community.
	   ``What we have said all along is that this rebellion is an
invasion by Rwanda and Uganda,'' said Ferdinand Mwana Naga, the
agriculture minister and one of Kabila's closest confidants. ``We
cannot stop fighting until those foreign aggressors are gone.''
	   The call for a cessation of hostilities came after Angolan
forces in Congo's southwestern Atlantic Ocean corridor retook a
string of coastal towns in a stunning reversal of rebel gains.
	   Angolans are now in control of the oil port town of Muanda and
the nearby towns of Banana and Boma.
	   On Monday, a U.S. envoy trying to mediate an end to the fighting
met in the Angolan capital with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
and said the talks were ``very positive and constructive.''
	   Howard Wolpe, the U.S. special envoy to Africa's Great Lakes
Region, said he and Dos Santos discussed prospects for a peaceful
solution to the insurrection.
	   ``We are looking for a political framework for this to happen,''
Wolpe told reporters in Luanda before leaving for South Africa,
where he said he would continue his efforts. He said he discussed
withdrawal of foreign troops with Dos Santos, but declined to
provide details.
	   Before the Angolans' entry, the Congolese rebels had make
remarkable progress toward Kinshasa in their three-week-old drive
to topple the government. Many of those same rebels had helped put
Kabila into power by ousting longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese
Seko last year.
	   Rebels in the west now appear to be caught between two foreign
forces in a narrow corridor of Congolese territory that links
Kinshasa to the Atlantic coast.
	   The Angolans are to the southwest of the rebels while Zimbabwean
soldiers deployed last week are defending Kinshasa's southern
outskirts.
	   The rebels claim to be in control of the eastern city of
Kisangani, although the reports could not be independently
confirmed.

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
commemorated the fifth anniversary of the Oslo Accords that set the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process in motion with a limited approval
of an Israeli offer to withdraw from part of the occupied West
Bank.
	   Arafat told reporters on Monday that he could accept a recent
Israeli proposal to include existing nature reserves as part of the

withdraw.
	   ``I can accept that,'' he said, calling the proposal ``a

	   However, his aides said Arafat will not accept an Israeli
proposal to set aside 3 percent of the land for a new nature
preserve that would prevent Palestinians from settling there.
	   Arafat also said he was willing to meet Netanyahu, as long as
there was a good chance of substantive talks.
	   In 1993, Norway held the secret contacts between Israel and the
PLO that led to mutual recognition and a framework agreement on

Nobel Peace Prize they shared with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin, who was assassinated the next year.
	   But the peace process has been bogged down since the right-wing
Likud government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took power
from Peres and the Labor Party in May 1996. Netanyahu did not
attend the Oslo ceremonies, saying he was too busy for such
nostalgia.
	   ``The Palestinian people have chose the way of the peace of the
brave,'' said Arafat in a speech to about 200 guests. ``I believe
the majority of the Israeli and the Palestinian people want
peace.''
	   In his speech, Peres said, ``In Oslo, what was the important
thing is that we got a Palestinian partner.'' Peres said he would
do everything he could to see the terms of the accords fulfilled.
	   U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross met representatives from both sides
during celebrations this weekend. He said he could talk with Arafat
to see if there was a basis for suggesting renewed talks.
	   Ross said the gap between the Israelis and Palestinians had
narrowed, but refused to discuss details.
	   ``We won't have a breakthrough until we have an agreement,''
said Ross, appearing at a news conference that also included
Arafat, Peres, and Meir Sheetrit, the leader of the Likud coalition
in Israel's Knesset.
	   In his own speech, Sheetrit said the Israeli government is
committed to peace.

	   BROOKLINE, Massachusetts (AP) _ Italy's Giannluca Pozzi upset
sixth-seeded Fabrice Santoro of France 6-2, 6-2 Monday in the first
round of the MFS Pro Tennis Championships at Longwood Cricket Club.
	   Pozzi, who is ranked 62nd in the world and boasts a win over No.
2 Marcelo Rios this summer, used his deep forehands to force
Santoro into numerous errors from the baseline.
	   Third-seeded Cedric Pioline was the highest ranked player to
advance. The veteran Parisian needed only 55 minutes to sweep past
Romania's Adrian Voinea 6-4, 6-0.
	   In other first-round matches, Kenneth Carlsen of Denmark
outlasted Jerome Golmard of France 3-6, 6-3, 6-4; Sebastien

Israel softens position on key issue, progress on pullback seen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report sides nearing agreement, contacts, CIA
representatives helping draw up security memorandum; EDITS to TRIM &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A deal on an Israeli troop withdrawal
seemed closer Monday, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
reportedly dropping a key precondition to an agreement and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat warming to Israeli ideas.
	   Palestinian negotiators confirmed Israel has softened its
position but said that differences were still unresolved regarding
an American proposal for an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13
percent of the West Bank.
	   Netanyahu's aide, David Bar-Illan said that Israel was
``considering the American ideas of 13 percent if they are divided
into two parts,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   In Oslo, Norway, for a ceremony marking the fifth anniversary of
the first peace accord between the two sides, Arafat called the
Israeli proposal ``a beginning,'' and said he had received the
ideas in writing.
	   Also attending the ceremony were negotiations from both sides
who were expected to meet with U.S. peace envoy to the Middle East,
Dennis Ross to discuss the remaining details of an agreement.
	   At a news conference after the ceremony, Ross said gaps between
the sides had narrowed, but refuse to discuss details. ``We won't
have a breakthrough until we have an agreement,'' Ross said.
	   Israel radio reported that there have been recent contacts
between Netanyahu, Arafat and their advisers and that Israel was
now easing its conditions over the main sticking point for an
agreement _ how a nature reserve would be defined under such an
accord.
	   Israel radio, quoting Israeli diplomatic sources said that
Israel was reversing an early position and was now willing to give
Palestinian police freedom of movement and allow limited building
within a 3 percent area of the West Bank from which Israel would
withdraw troops and convert into a nature reserve. That area would
be defined as part of Area B, which gives Palestinians control over
civil affairs but leaves over-all security to Israel.
	   Asked in Norway to comment on reports of the new ideas, Arafat
said he had been handed a paper by the Israel side and ``would
accept,'' nature reserves under an Area B plan.
	   Israel radio also reported that representatives of the CIA and
Palestinians security officials have begun drawing up a new
security memorandum on fighting terrorism. Israel has been
insisting that no deal could be completed unless they received
assurances from the Palestinian Authority on combating militants.
	   Officials in Jerusalem said the results of a Ross-Arafat meeting
in Oslo, would determine whether Ross returns to the area to
wrap-up the deal, Israel radio reported.
	   One stumbling block, which seemed lifted earlier Monday, had
been Israel's insistence that the Palestinians convene the
545-member Palestine National Council to remove ambiguity about
whether it had canceled clauses in the PLO charter which call for
Israel's destruction.
	   Palestinians have maintained the PNC already took action to
revoke the charter. A senior Israeli official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said that Israel told U.S. negotiators that
it would now agree to start the withdrawal process without a new
meeting.
	   The official said Israel was now willing to accept a statement
from the smaller PLO executive committee that it would reconvene
the PNC within the four-month period of phased pullbacks.
	   Netanyahu said in a speech Monday that the charter must be
reversed but he did not specify under what conditions.
	   Palestinian officials said a new, exploratory channel had been
opened between Netanyahu confidant Yitzhak Molcho, and Ahmed
Qureia, the speaker of the Palestinian legislative council. They
also said Israel was backing away from previous positions.
	   ``The Israelis called us and said we have something new we want
to show you. They said, `we have abandoned our demand for the
convening of the PNC' and said that they are willing to withdraw
from 13 percent ...,'' said Nabil Shaath, a minister in Arafat's
Cabinet and a top negotiator.
	   In the tensely divided West Bank city of Hebron, where a
prominent rabbi was killed last week by a Palestinian assailant,
Israel troops enforced a curfew in the downtown area for a fourth
day and fired rubber bullets at Palestinian stone throwers.
	   About a dozen Palestinian children threw stones from rooftops
onto Israeli soldiers in the streets below. Troops fired two rounds
of rubber bullets towards the protesters. There were no reports of
injuries.
	   Twelve Palestinians were also detained after they broke curfew
and lined up by troops for identity checks. The army eased a siege
over the city however, permitting some 6,000 workers and merchants
to leave town and get to jobs in Israel.

Council urges cease-fire in Kosovo, says humanitarian disaster
</HEADLINE>
possible &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With Serb shells nearing Kosovo's capital,
the Security Council urged an immediate cease-fire in the Yugoslav
province Monday and warned of a humanitarian disaster if fighting
continues.
	   In a statement, the 15-member council reaffirmed the territorial
integrity of Yugoslavia and called on the Serb leadership to enter
into negotiations with ethnic Albanians, who comprise about 90
percent of the population of Kosovo, where most want independence.
	   ``The council emphasizes that the authorities of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia and the Kosovo Albanians must achieve a
political solution to the issue of Kosovo and that all violence and
acts of terrorism from whatever quarter are unacceptable,'' the
council said in a statement.
	   The provincial capital, Pristina, has so far escaped the
escalated fighting that has killed hundreds of people and displaced
an estimated 230,000 from their homes since the Serbs launched a
crackdown on ethnic Albanian rebels early this year.
	   On Monday, refugees reported Serb shells were landing between 15
and 35 kilometers (about 10 and 20 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   Council members expressed concern ``that the continuation or
further escalation of the conflict in Kosovo has dangerous
implications for the stability of the region.
	   ``In particular, the council is gravely concerned that given the
increasing numbers of displaced persons, coupled with the
approaching winter, the situation in Kosovo has the potential to
become an even greater humanitarian disaster,'' a statement said.
	   The council has generally taken a low-key response to the
conflict, preferring to let U.S. envoys, NATO and the Contact Group
_ made up of the United States, Russia, Britain, France, Germany
and Italy _ take the lead.

Langley, Canada 4, Guadalupe, Mexico 3
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Monday's play &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID KINNEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WILLIAMSPORT, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Mike Erickson hit two home
runs and reliever Jeff Duda didn't give up a hit over three innings
as Langley, Canada, beat Guadalupe, Mexico, 4-3 Monday to hand the
defending champion its second loss of the Little League World
Series.
	   Duda held Guadalupe scoreless in the final three innings of the
rain-delayed game, striking out eight batters _ including all three
in the sixth.
	   Erickson went 2-for-3, and one of his home runs broke a 3-3 tie
in the fifth inning.
	   Jorge Trevino hit a two-run homer for Guadalupe.
	   Guadalupe, who lost 6-1 to Kashima, Japan, on Sunday, is now 0-2
in pool play. Langley is 1-0.
	   Langley took a 3-0 first-inning lead behind back-to-back home
runs by Erickson, a two-run shot, and starting pitcher Sean
Sargent.
	   But Guadalupe starting pitcher Daniel Baca settled down,
striking out Karl Reddick with the bases loaded to end the threat.
He would retire 11 of the next 12 batters as his teammates rallied
on offense.
	   In the bottom of the first, Sargent walked Carlos Garza, who
came home on a passed ball. In the second, Trevino's two-run homer
tied the game 3-3.
	   Baca gave up just two hits after the first inning _ but one was
the game-deciding homer by Erickson.
	   Guadalupe is trying to repeat the feat of the last Mexican team
to win the World Series, Monterrey, which won back-to-back
championships in 1957-58.
	   A Canadian team has never won the World Series.
	   Rain threatened Monday's games; the first game was halted for an
hour.
	   The top finishers in the U.S and international pool competitions
play Thursday. The winners meet in Saturday's final.

	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ Dutch international Jimmy Floyd
Hasselbaink scored Leeds' first goal of the season as United edged
Blackburn 1-0 Monday in the last match of the Premier League's
second round.
	   Hasselbaink, who missed United's opening 0-0 tie with
Middlesbrough, combined with compatriot Clyde Wijnhard to cut
through Blackburn's defense and open his 1998-99 ledger in the 18th
minute.
	   Hasselbaink, who scored 22 goals in his first season at Elland
Road last season, menaced the Blackburn defense for the remainder
of the match but failed to improve on his opening goal.
	   Harry Kewell made inroads for Leeds on the left flank in the
second half, while Blackburn threatened to snatch a last minute
equalizer, but there was no further score in the match.
	   Leeds finished fifth in the league last season, one place ahead
of Blackburn on the table, but clearly dominated the attack Monday
and were deserving winners.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo rejected a proposed cease-fire on
Monday as its allied forces captured former rebel strongholds,
including the key Congo River port town of Matadi in the country's
west.
	   Information Minister Didier Mumengi said Congolese and Angolan
forces had retaken Matadi _ the only major port town on the Congo
River.
	   Ugandan troops supporting a rebel army seeking to topple
President Laurent Kabila were seen deploying in the northeast.
	   What began three weeks ago as an armed rebellion against Kabila
has now drawn three of Congo's neighboring countries _ Rwanda and
Uganda for the rebels and Angola for the government _ into the
conflict. Nearby Zimbabwe has also sent troops to shore up
government defenses.
	   Zimbabwean Defense Minister Moven Mahachi was quoted on
Zimbabwean radio Monday saying his forces defending the Congolese
capital's southern outskirts had successfully held off rebel
assaults.
	   ``Zimbabwean troops in the Congolese capital are well trained
and are backed with sophisticated equipment, strong enough to stop
any rebel advance,'' Mahachi was quoted as saying.
	   Uganda and Rwanda both deny involvement in the war, but at least
500 Ugandan troops, two tanks and anti-aircraft guns were spotted
by a British tourist about 170 kilometers (105 miles) inside
Congolese territory.
	   Rwanda is believed to be the main sponsor of the rebel movement
_ a coalition of ethnic Tutsis and former members of Kabila's
military.
	   At least 2,000 Angolan and 600 Zimbabwean troops are also now in
the country, a ministry-level government official said on condition
of anonymity.
	   Efforts in South Africa to halt the fighting were blocked when
Congo's delegate to peace talks there and the government in
Kinshasa rejected a cease-fire proposal made by President Nelson
Mandela.
	   Mandela convened the talks as head of the 14-member Southern
African Development Community.
	   ``What we have said all along is that this rebellion is an
invasion by Rwanda and Uganda,'' said Ferdinand Mwana Naga, the
agriculture minister and one of Kabila's closest confidants. ``We
cannot stop fighting until those foreign aggressors are gone.''
	   The call for a cessation of hostilities came after Angolan
forces in Congo's southwestern Atlantic Ocean corridor retook a
string of coastal towns in a stunning reversal of rebel gains.
	   Angolans are now in control of the oil port town of Muanda and
the nearby towns of Banana and Boma.
	   On Monday, a U.S. envoy trying to mediate an end to the fighting
met in the Angolan capital with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
and said the talks were ``very positive and constructive.''
	   Howard Wolpe, the U.S. special envoy to Africa's Great Lakes
Region, said he and Dos Santos discussed prospects for a peaceful
solution to the insurrection.
	   ``We are looking for a political framework for this to happen,''
Wolpe told reporters in Luanda before leaving for South Africa,
where he said he would continue his efforts. He said he discussed
withdrawal of foreign troops with Dos Santos, but declined to
provide details.
	   Before the Angolans' entry, the Congolese rebels had make
remarkable progress toward Kinshasa in their three-week-old drive
to topple the government. Many of those same rebels had helped put
Kabila into power by ousting longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese
Seko last year.
	   Rebels in the west now appear to be caught between two foreign
forces in a narrow corridor of Congolese territory that links
Kinshasa to the Atlantic coast.
	   The Angolans are to the southwest of the rebels while Zimbabwean
soldiers deployed last week are defending Kinshasa's southern
outskirts.
	   The rebels claim to be in control of the eastern city of
Kisangani, although the reports could not be independently
confirmed.

Israel softens position on key issue, progress on pullback seen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report sides nearing agreement, contacts, CIA
representatives helping draw up security memorandum; EDITS to TRIM &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A deal on an Israeli troop withdrawal
seemed closer Monday, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
reportedly dropping a key precondition to an agreement and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat warming to Israeli ideas.
	   Palestinian negotiators confirmed Israel has softened its
position but said that differences were still unresolved regarding
an American proposal for an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13
percent of the West Bank.
	   Netanyahu's aide, David Bar-Illan said that Israel was
``considering the American ideas of 13 percent if they are divided
into two parts,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   In Oslo, Norway, for a ceremony marking the fifth anniversary of
the first peace accord between the two sides, Arafat called the
Israeli proposal ``a beginning,'' and said he had received the
ideas in writing.
	   Also attending the ceremony were negotiations from both sides
who were expected to meet with U.S. peace envoy to the Middle East,
Dennis Ross to discuss the remaining details of an agreement.
	   At a news conference after the ceremony, Ross said gaps between
the sides had narrowed, but refuse to discuss details. ``We won't
have a breakthrough until we have an agreement,'' Ross said.
	   Israel radio reported that there have been recent contacts
between Netanyahu, Arafat and their advisers and that Israel was
now easing its conditions over the main sticking point for an
agreement _ how a nature reserve would be defined under such an
accord.
	   Israel radio, quoting Israeli diplomatic sources said that
Israel was reversing an early position and was now willing to give
Palestinian police freedom of movement and allow limited building
within a 3 percent area of the West Bank from which Israel would
withdraw troops and convert into a nature reserve. That area would
be defined as part of Area B, which gives Palestinians control over
civil affairs but leaves over-all security to Israel.
	   Asked in Norway to comment on reports of the new ideas, Arafat
said he had been handed a paper by the Israel side and ``would
accept,'' nature reserves under an Area B plan.
	   Israel radio also reported that representatives of the CIA and
Palestinians security officials have begun drawing up a new
security memorandum on fighting terrorism. Israel has been
insisting that no deal could be completed unless they received
assurances from the Palestinian Authority on combating militants.
	   Officials in Jerusalem said the results of a Ross-Arafat meeting
in Oslo, would determine whether Ross returns to the area to
wrap-up the deal, Israel radio reported.
	   One stumbling block, which seemed lifted earlier Monday, had
been Israel's insistence that the Palestinians convene the
545-member Palestine National Council to remove ambiguity about
whether it had canceled clauses in the PLO charter which call for
Israel's destruction.
	   Palestinians have maintained the PNC already took action to
revoke the charter. A senior Israeli official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said that Israel told U.S. negotiators that
it would now agree to start the withdrawal process without a new
meeting.
	   The official said Israel was now willing to accept a statement
from the smaller PLO executive committee that it would reconvene
the PNC within the four-month period of phased pullbacks.
	   Netanyahu said in a speech Monday that the charter must be
reversed but he did not specify under what conditions.
	   Palestinian officials said a new, exploratory channel had been
opened between Netanyahu confidant Yitzhak Molcho, and Ahmed
Qureia, the speaker of the Palestinian legislative council. They
also said Israel was backing away from previous positions.

El-Bashir: Clinton guilty of `ugly crime' in missile strike

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's president said Monday that if the
United States truly believed a Khartoum factory made chemical
weapons, it committed ``an ugly crime'' by bombing it in the midst
of a city and endangering thousands of lives.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, President Omar Hassan
el-Bashir argued this was evidence U.S. officials knew the Khartoum
plant made only medicines _ as Sudan maintains.
	   El-Bashir also said he was recalling Sudan's ambassador to
Britain and would ask London to withdraw its ambassador in response
to Britain's support for the U.S. missile strike on the factory
Thursday night.
	   The president last week called back all Sudanese diplomats from
Washington. On Monday he said American diplomats, who have been
working out of neighboring Kenya and Egypt since 1996, ``will not
be allowed to return to their work in Khartoum.''
	   He added that ambassadors from European countries that supported
the missile strike would be summoned ``to inform them of our strong
protest for their positions.''
	   At least a half-dozen missiles struck the Al-Shifa
Pharmaceutical Industries Co. factory in North Khartoum on
Thursday, largely destroying it.
	   President Clinton tied the factory to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi
dissident blamed for the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania on Aug. 7 that killed 257 people. A second U.S. attack was
carried out Thursday against bin Laden's bases in Afghanistan.
	   U.S. officials said the factory made precursors for the deadly
VX chemical. Sudan insists that it made only pharmaceuticals and
supplied half the nation's needs.
	   In a separate interview Monday, Hassan Turabi _ a Muslim cleric
who is Parliament speaker and widely believed to be the power
behind el-Bashir's government _ said bin Laden was not a terrorist.
	   ``He would assist anyone who is persecuted,'' Turabi said. ``He
would assist any persecuted minority or community persecuted by
another majority or foreign power.''
	   Turabi, who said he was a friend of bin Laden, noted that the
Americans considered bin Laden ``a hero'' when he was fighting the
Russians in Afghanistan. ``But once the Russians have gone, he
himself retroactively became a terrorist,'' Turabi said.
	   Bin Laden lived in Sudan in the early 1990s but was forced out
under Western pressure in 1995.
	   In his interview, el-Bashir argued that if the Americans really
believed the factory made chemical weapons, then bombing it would
have released deadly poison into the air and put at risk the
thousands of Sudanese people who live around it.
	   ``Then this is a crime, an ugly crime,'' el-Bashir added.
	   He accused Clinton of being ``a war criminal of the first
degree'' for the strike.
	   El-Bashir said, however, that he would consider resuming
relations with the United States if it ``compensates all those who
were harmed in the factory attack and it publicly apologizes.''
	   At a news conference earlier in the day, el-Bashir repeated an
invitation to have a U.N. fact-finding mission inspect the factory.
	   He also told reporters that the United States assured it through
a third party that his government was ``not targeted in the attack,
but terrorism.''
	   ``They also said that they wanted cooperation between the
Sudanese and the American security apparatus, and this happens for
the first time, although they have refused a similar request we
made in the past,'' el-Bashir said.
	   He would not name the third party. American officials have said
nothing publicly about opening a channel with Sudan.
	   El-Bashir also said the attack was carried out ``to cover up for
the Monica scandal,'' a reference to the grand jury investigation
into Clinton's relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
	   In the latest government-staged demonstration, several hundred
women rallied in Khartoum on Monday to denounce the attack on the
factory.
	   ``Away, away, USA!'' the protesters shouted. Most were from
women's groups loyal to the Islamic government or students let out
of school for the rally.
	   ``God willing, we'll create a million factories for chemical
weapons,'' said Naamat Abdel-Razeq, 28. ``If they want to destroy
plants, then we'll build them.''

sixth-seeded Fabrice Santoro of France 6-2, 6-2 Monday in the first
round of the MFS Pro Tennis Championships at Longwood Cricket Club.
	   Pozzi, who is ranked 62nd in the world and boasts a win over No.
2 Marcelo Rios this summer, used his deep forehands to force
Santoro into numerous errors from the baseline.
	   Third-seeded Cedric Pioline was the highest ranked player to
advance. The veteran Parisian needed only 55 minutes to sweep past
Romania's Adrian Voinea 6-4, 6-0.
	   In other first-round matches, Kenneth Carlsen of Denmark
outlasted Jerome Golmard of France 3-6, 6-3, 6-4; Sebastien
Grosjean of France stopped John van Lottum of the Netherlands 6-2,
6-0; and 18-year-old Xavier Malisse of Belgium beat Steve Campbell
6-3, 6-1.
	   Eighth-seeded Vince Spadea withdrew Monday morning with a
sprained right wrist.

Sudanese president: Clinton 'war criminal' for missile strike

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's leader accused U.S. President
Bill Clinton on Monday of being ``a war criminal of the first
degree'' for an attack on a Khartoum factory the United States says
made chemical weapons.
	   President Omar Hassan el-Bashir said that if the United States
truly believed the factory manufactured chemical weapons, it
committed ``an ugly crime'' by bombing it in the midst of a city
and endangering thousands of lives.
	   Since deadly gas apparently wasn't released into the atmosphere,
el-Bashir told The Associated Press, it proves the Sudanese claim
that the plant made only medicine.
	   ``The American president has violated international law, and he
meant to destroy a civilian establishment and to kill innocent
people. ... He is a war criminal of the first degree,'' el-Bashir
said.
	   Despite the angry words, the Sudanese president said he would
consider resuming relations with the United States if it
``compensates all those who were harmed in the factory attack and
it publicly apologizes.''
	   At an earlier news conference, el-Bashir said the United States
has asked to open security cooperation with Sudan and assured it
through a third party that the government was ``not targeted in the
attack, but terrorism.''
	   He would not name the third party or elaborate on the U.S.
proposal.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Foley said he
had no information about security cooperation.
	   ``The report, as far as I can tell, is absolutely not true,'' he
said.
	   El-Bashir also said he was recalling Sudan's ambassador to
Britain and would ask London to withdraw its ambassador from
Khartoum in response to Britain's support for the U.S. missile
strike on the factory Thursday night.
	   Sudan last week recalled its diplomats from Washington. On
Monday, el-Bashir said American diplomats, who have been working
out of neighboring Kenya and Egypt since 1996, ``will not be
allowed to return to their work in Khartoum.''
	   He added that ambassadors from European countries that supported
the missile strike would be summoned ``to inform them of our strong
protest for their positions.''
	   At least a half-dozen U.S. missiles struck the Al-Shifa
Pharmaceutical Industries Co. factory on Thursday, largely
destroying it.
	   Clinton tied the factory to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi dissident
blamed for the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on
Aug. 7 that killed 257 people. Another U.S. attack was carried out
Thursday against bin Laden's bases in Afghanistan.
	   U.S. officials said the factory made precursors for the deadly
VX chemical. Sudan insists that it made only pharmaceuticals and
supplied half the nation's needs.
	   In a separate interview Monday, Hassan Turabi _ a Muslim cleric
who is Parliament speaker and widely believed to be the power
behind el-Bashir's government _ said bin Laden was not a terrorist.
	   ``He would assist anyone who is persecuted,'' Turabi said. ``He
would assist any persecuted minority or community persecuted by
another majority or foreign power.''
	   Turabi, who said he was a friend of bin Laden, noted that the
Americans considered bin Laden ``a hero'' when he was fighting the
Russians in Afghanistan. ``But once the Russians have gone, he
himself retroactively became a terrorist,'' Turabi said.
	   Meanwhile, at the news conference, el-Bashir repeated an
invitation to have a U.N. fact-finding mission inspect the factory.
	   The United States accuses Sudan of sponsoring terrorism, but did
not directly tie it to the targeted factory.
	   El-Bashir insisted that bin Laden ``has no shares at all in the
factory,'' adding that bin Laden left Sudan before the factory was
opened in 1996. Bin Laden lived in Sudan in the early 1990s but was
forced out under Western pressure in 1995.
	   In a personal jab at Clinton, el-Bashir said the attack was
carried out ``to cover up for the Monica scandal,'' a reference to
the ongoing investigation into Clinton's relationship with former
White House volunteer Monica Lewinsky.
	   In the latest government-staged demonstration, several hundred
women rallied in the capital on Monday to denounce the attack.
	   ``Away, away, USA!'' the protesters shouted. Most were from
women's groups loyal to the Islamic government or students let out
of school for the rally.
	   ``God willing, we'll create a million factories for chemical
weapons,'' said Naamat Abdel-Razeq, 28. ``If they want to destroy
plants, then we'll build them.''

BBC report: Taliban say bin Laden promises restraint
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Saudi militant Osama bin Laden has promised the
Taliban authorities in Afghanistan that he will refrain from
military or political activity against other countries while on
Afghan soil, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported Monday.
	   The United States has accused bin Laden of instigating the
bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   The BBC said bin Laden had sent a message to the Taliban leader,
Mullah Mohammed Omar, saying that he would obey orders from the
Taliban in Afghanistan. The BBC's report quoted a senior Taliban
official, who was not further identified.
	   The BBC said Omar had sent an emissary to bin Laden after the
Saudi had threatened retaliation for U.S. strikes against bin
Laden's base in Afghanistan. Omar told bin Laden that it was for
Afghan authorities to respond to a strike on their territory, the
BBC quoted the Taliban official as saying.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The Spice Girls said Monday they may add ``two new
members to the Spice family'' _ a statement which didn't quite
confirm that two members of the pop group are pregnant.
	   Published reports have said that ``Posh Spice'' Victoria Adams
is expecting a child with her soccer-star boyfriend David Beckham,
and that ``Scary Spice'' Melanie Brown and her man, dancer Jimmy
Gulzar, are also expecting.
	   A statement released by the group's publicists said:
	   ``We are sisters and love each other, and love being together as
a band and as friends. We plan to continue on, perhaps adding two
new members to the Spice family.
	   ``Until such a time as we are sure of our news and ready to make
a statement we would like to appeal to people to give us privacy
during this time.''
	   The statement then went on to plug the group's forthcoming album
and two British concert dates.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo rejected a proposed cease-fire on
Monday as its allied forces captured former rebel strongholds,
including the key Congo River port town of Matadi in the country's
west.
	   Information Minister Didier Mumengi said Congolese and Angolan
forces had retaken Matadi _ the only major port town on the Congo
River.
	   Angolan state radio RNA reported Monday that the rebels fighting
Kabila's government were holed up at the town of Inga, near Matadi.
Inga is the site of a key power dam that supplies Kinshasa and
southern Congo with its electricity. The report did not give its
sources.
	   The rebels were threatening to blow up the dam if they were not
given guarantees for their surrender which they were negotiating
with Kabila's troops, the RNA report said
	   Meanwhile, Ugandan troops supporting a rebel army seeking to
topple President Laurent Kabila were seen deploying in the
northeast.
	   What began three weeks ago as an armed rebellion against Kabila
has now drawn three of Congo's neighboring countries _ Rwanda and
Uganda for the rebels and Angola for the government _ into the
conflict. Nearby Zimbabwe has also sent troops to shore up
government defenses.
	   Zimbabwean Defense Minister Moven Mahachi was quoted on
Zimbabwean radio Monday saying his forces defending the Congolese
capital's southern outskirts had successfully held off rebel
assaults.
	   ``Zimbabwean troops in the Congolese capital are well trained
and are backed with sophisticated equipment, strong enough to stop
any rebel advance,'' Mahachi was quoted as saying.
	   Uganda and Rwanda both deny involvement in the war, but at least
500 Ugandan troops, two tanks and anti-aircraft guns were spotted
by a British tourist about 170 kilometers (105 miles) inside
Congolese territory.
	   Rwanda is believed to be the main sponsor of the rebel movement
_ a coalition of ethnic Tutsis and former members of Kabila's
military.
	   At least 2,000 Angolan and 600 Zimbabwean troops are also now in
the country, a ministry-level government official said on condition
of anonymity.
	   Efforts in South Africa to halt the fighting were blocked when
Congo's delegate to peace talks there and the government in
Kinshasa rejected a cease-fire proposal made by President Nelson
Mandela.
	   Mandela convened the talks as head of the 14-member Southern
African Development Community.
	   ``What we have said all along is that this rebellion is an
invasion by Rwanda and Uganda,'' said Ferdinand Mwana Naga, the
agriculture minister and one of Kabila's closest confidants. ``We
cannot stop fighting until those foreign aggressors are gone.''
	   The call for a cessation of hostilities came after Angolan
forces in Congo's southwestern Atlantic Ocean corridor retook a
string of coastal towns in a stunning reversal of rebel gains.
	   Angolans are now in control of the oil port town of Muanda and
the nearby towns of Banana and Boma.
	   On Monday, a U.S. envoy trying to mediate an end to the fighting
met in the Angolan capital with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
and said the talks were ``very positive and constructive.''
	   Howard Wolpe, the U.S. special envoy to Africa's Great Lakes
Region, said he and Dos Santos discussed prospects for a peaceful
solution to the insurrection.
	   ``We are looking for a political framework for this to happen,''
Wolpe told reporters in Luanda before leaving for South Africa,
where he said he would continue his efforts. He said he discussed
withdrawal of foreign troops with Dos Santos, but declined to
provide details.
	   Before the Angolans' entry, the Congolese rebels had make
remarkable progress toward Kinshasa in their three-week-old drive
to topple the government. Many of those same rebels had helped put
Kabila into power by ousting longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese
Seko last year.
	   Rebels in the west now appear to be caught between two foreign
forces in a narrow corridor of Congolese territory that links
Kinshasa to the Atlantic coast.
	   The Angolans are to the southwest of the rebels while Zimbabwean
soldiers deployed last week are defending Kinshasa's southern

<TEXT>
	   WILLIAMSPORT, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Kevin Hodges is such a
perfectionist that when he threw the first perfect game in the
history of the Southern Regionals, he was a little upset.
	   See, he'd gone 0-for-3 at the plate.
	   He didn't seem all that thrilled about his two-hitter Monday
that gave Greenville, North Carolina (U.S. South), a 3-1 victory
over Jenison, Michigan (U.S. Central), in the Little League World
Series.
	   ``They were hitting my fastball, so I had to throw some
curveballs,'' he said, sounding a little disappointed that his heat
hadn't blown them away and that he had to rely on his curve to get
those nine strikeouts.
	   ``His goal is to fan everybody and hit three grand slams as
well,'' his manager, Wayne Hardee, said.
	   Instead, Justin Hardee provided the offense Monday, going
3-for-3 with two singles, a run scored and a sixth-inning solo
homer that padded Greenville's lead.
	   In Monday's first game, Mike Erickson hit two home runs and
reliever Jeff Duda didn't give up a hit over three innings as
Langley, Canada, beat Guadalupe, Mexico, 4-3 to hand the defending
champion its second loss of the World Series.
	   Guadalupe, which lost 6-1 to Kashima, Japan, on Sunday, is 0-2
in pool play as is Jenison, which lost to Toms River, New Jersey
(U.S. East), 13-9 Sunday in 11 innings.
	   Langley and Greenville are 1-0.
	   In later games Monday, it was: Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, vs.
Kashima, Japan, and U.S. West vs. U.S. East. Kashima and Toms River
are each 1-0 in pool play.
	   The top finishers in the U.S and international pool competitions
play Thursday. The winners meet in Saturday's final.

Rafter peaking at right time to defend title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Patrick Rafter says he is peaking just at the
right time to defend his U.S. Open men's singles title next week.
	   ``It feels good going into a Grand Slam knowing that I can put
two good weeks of tennis together,'' Rafter said of winning
back-to-back titles this month at the Canadian Open and ATP
Championship.
	   Rafter beat six of the world's top 20 players in sweeping the
two hardcourt tournaments. In the ATP Championship final, the No.
3-ranked Rafter outlasted No. 1 Pete Sampras in three sets,
breaking an eight-match losing streak to the American.
	   ``I put together some of my best tennis ever those two weeks,
similar to the way I played at the U.S. Open last year,'' Rafter
said of his unexpected run through the Open last year to win his
first Grand Slam tournament title.
	   ``I begin this U.S. Open with a better chance than last year,
but that doesn't mean that I am going to win it,'' Rafter said at a
promotional appearance Monday.
	   When Rafter defeated Greg Rusedski of Britain in last year's
title match, he added his name to a list of fellow Australians,
like Rod Laver and Lew Hoad, who have won the championship. And it
was some words of encouragement earlier this year from the last
Australian to win the U.S. Open, 1973 champion John Newcombe, that
helped fuel his recent strong play, according to Rafter.
	   ``I got this fax from him right before Wimbledon saying that I
was getting off the rails a little bit and that I should stop being
hard on myself,'' said the 26-year-old Rafter. ``I was showing too
much frustration and the wrong kind of emotions.''
	   Before Newcombe's message, Rafter had a 19-13 won-lost match
record. Since then, he has gone 21-3, losing most recently at New
Haven, Connecticut, last week in the third round.
	   Rafter will look to get back on the winning track this week at
the Hamlet Cup in Commack, New York. The tournament's No. 2 seed is
scheduled to play Javier Sanchez of Spain on Tuesday.

Mitchell to fight IAAF suspension
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Calling this the ``darkest hour of my life,''
three-time Olympian sprinter Dennis Mitchell says he will fight the
drug suspension handed down by the International Amateur Athletic
Federation.
	   ``This is the blackest mark that any athlete can have on their
record,'' Mitchell said at a news conference Monday where he was
flanked by his lawyer Suja Thomas.
	   ``I have done nothing wrong, but I am not being permitted to
compete. I will now proceed through the hearing process,'' Mitchell
said. ``I can only hope that justice will prevail and I will be
rightfully exonerated.''
	   Mitchell, 32, has requested a hearing before the USA Track and
Field Doping Hearing Board. Thomas said they anticipate the hearing
will be held in October.
	   Mitchell was given a two-year suspension for testing positive
for testosterone at an out-of-competition test April 1 at his home
in Gainesville, Fla.
	   ``My dedication to this sport and to society would not and could
not allow me to do such a thing,'' said Mitchell, the 1992 Olympic
bronze medalist at 100 meters.
	   ``This is both morally and ethically unacceptable to me. I have
throughout my career thought that the only way to succeed was
through hard work and dedication to yourself and God. I would have
never in my wildest dreams thought this would happen to me.''
	   Thomas said Mitchell will contest the validity of the test on
two grounds.
	   ``Experts will look at whether or not the test itself was
correct,'' Thomas said of the two urine samples. ``And, two, if the
test was correct, what could have caused the testosterone to
epitestosterone (another natural substance) level to increase
(above the allowable ratio of 6:1).''
	   The three-member Doping Hearing Board can vote by a simple
majority that Mitchell is not guilty and he would be free to
compete again.
	   Last month, Mitchell ran on the winning U.S. 400-meter relay
team at the Goodwill Games.
	   Right now, Mitchell says he is finding it difficult just to step
on a track.
	   ``When this first started I was still going out to the track
every day and working hard and hoping that this thing was a big
dream,'' said Mitchell. ``But now it has become this nightmare.
	   ``It is now even hard for me to go out and actually train hard
because this is always in the back of my mind. I don't feel that
purity that track and field used to bring to me anymore.''
	   As the president of the USATF's Athletes Advisory Committee, the
athletes' voice in the national governing body, Mitchell has been
an outspoken advocate of keeping drugs out of his sport.
	   ``Overnight that has been taken away from me,'' said Mitchell.
``The things that have happened to me in the last few months will
forever affect all parts of my life. This can never be taken
away.''

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, Australia (AP) _ John Schuster is poised to make an
international rugby comeback with Samoa, nine years after he played
for the All Blacks.
	   Schuster, 34, has been named yesterday in the Samoa training
squad to prepare for the World Cup qualifying tournament in
Australia next month.
	   Schuster, who switched to rugby league after the tour of Ireland
and Wales and 10 tests for the All Blacks, has been playing both
codes in Britain in recent years.
	   He played league for Halifax and more recently rugby with
Harlequins, where his old Wellington and All Black teammate John
Gallagher is on the coaching staff. He also played for Samoa in
rugby league's 1995 World Cup tournament in Britain.
	   Another high profile All Black convert to rugby league, Va'aiga
Tuigamala, is also in the squad.
	   The Samoans have named a squad of 35 from which five will be
omitted.
	   Squad: Silao Leaega, Mike Umaga, Brian Lima, Afato So'oalo, Alex
Telea, George Harder, Va'aiga Tuigamala, George Leaupepe, Terry
Fanolua, To'o Vaega, John Schuster, Stephen Bachop, Earl Va'a, Joe
Filemu, Stephen So'oialo, John Clarke, Pat Lam, Junior Paramore,

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Dismissing plots and
threats against his life, Fidel Castro bade farewell to the
Dominican Republic on Monday, insisting that his communist
revolution will endure long after he is gone.
	   ``Men die. Peoples are immortal,'' the 72-year-old Cuban leader
told university students and leftist activists in a speech that
lasted more than five hours. ``History marches on.''
	   To push his point, Castro referred to the extraordinarily heavy
security surrounding his five-day visit to the Dominican Republic _
motivated by alleged threats in recent weeks by Cuban exiles to
assassinate him here.
	   ``Nervous? Maybe yes,'' he said of official concerns about the
threats. But he noted sarcastically that time and again he had
reportedly fallen seriously ill.
	   ``I'm not very worried about what will happen in Cuba,'' Castro
told his doe-eyed audience. ``The real question is, `What will
happen in the world? Your future depends on the future of the
world. The future of the United States depends very much upon the
world's future.''
	   It was a swan song of sorts for Castro, who flew home Friday
evening, ending his first-ever visit to the neighboring Dominican
Republic in his 39 years as Cuba's leader.

	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ Mark McGwire took the day off, and, as it
turned out, the St. Louis Cardinals and Pittsburgh Pirates did, too
_ at least in the standings.
	   The Cardinals-Pirates game was rained out in the middle of the
seventh inning Monday afternoon with the score tied 5-5. The result
goes down as a tie, and all statistics count.

<TEXT>
	   COMMACK, New York (AP) _ Brazil's Fernando Meligeni beat
France's Guillaume Raoux 6-7 (2-7), 6-4, 6-3 on Monday in the first
round of the Hamlet Cup.
	   ``I played poorly in the first set and was surprised that I got
it to a tiebreaker,'' said Meligeni, ranked 48th in the world.
``Once we got into the second set, I played better and harder. I
stayed calm, really concentrated and felt he was going to give me
an opening.''
	   Raoux, ranked 45th, will get some needed rest leading up to the
start of the U.S. Open next week.
	   ``I lost my concentration,'' Raoux said. ``This is my seventh
tournament in the last eight weeks. I tried to win, but I'm very
tired. It's tough to stay aggressive over such a long span.''
	   Spain's Francisco Clavet also advanced, beating Israel's Lior
Mor 6-2, 6-1. Fourth-ranked Petr Korda of the Czech Republic and
two-time winner Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia withdrew because of
injuries. Korda has a neck injury, while Kafelnikov's injury was
not immediately known.
	   Australia's Patrick Rafter, preparing for his U.S. Open title
defense, begins play Tuesday night against Spain's Javier Sanchez.
Spain's Carlos Moya, the winner last year over Rafter, also opens
Tuesday night, against New Zealand's Brett Steven.

	   SEATTLE (AP) _ Ken Griffey Jr. hit his AL-leading 44th home run
Monday as the Seattle Mariners completed a four-game sweep of the
Chicago White Sox with a 11-10 victory.
	   Seattle, which led 9-1 in the fifth, allowed Chicago to close to
9-6 in the eighth. After consecutive run-scoring wild pitches by
Jaime Navarro in the bottom half, Robin Ventura hit in 10th career
grand slam in the ninth.
	   Griffey, who also had an RBI double, is showing signs of
snapping out of his prolonged power drought, which saw him hit only
home run in 87 at-bats before Sunday.
	   Ken Cloude (8-9) allowed three runs and four hits in seven
innings, and Timlin got his 12th save. Mike Sirotka (12-12) gave up
eight runs and eight hits in 3 2-3 innings.

UConn basketball team hires security guards for Israel tour
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANNY BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The University of Connecticut basketball
team, which arrived in Israel Monday, said they are taking threats
against Americans seriously and hired two security guards to
protect them while in the country.
	   The team begins a series of friendly games against Israeli
professional teams beginning Tuesday in Tel Aviv.
	   Islamic militants have threatened to strike at American and
Israeli interests in retaliation for U.S. missile strikes last week
against suspected terror bases in Sudan and Afghanistan run by
Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden.
	   ``The administration of the University of Connecticut demanded
bodyguards and we readily agreed,'' said the teams' tour operator
Nels Hawkinson. ``Had it not been for the bombings in Afghanistan
and Sudan we would not have seen the need,'' he said.
	   But despite the security concerns, team coach Jim Calhoun said
he was excited to be back in Israel on his ninth visit to the
country. Calhoun cited a special relationship between UConn, which
has had four Israeli players, and the Jewish state.
	   Calhoun said the ``tour is especially important,'' because the
games against Israeli teams could help UConn, which isn't scheduled
to begin organized practice for another six weeks, get back into
shape.
	   Several stars, including injured Richard Hamilton, are not on
the tour but freshman point guard Khalid El-Amin, and newly
recruited Chris Smith will play in games against three Israeli
teams and one Greek team during the visit.
	   The first game will be against perennial national Israeli
champions Maccabi Tel Aviv, considered to be on of the top teams on
the international basketball circuit.
	   ``It's a chance of these guys to prove themselves. We are good
enough to really give Maccabi a game,'' Calhoun said a press
conference in Tel Aviv shortly after arriving.
	   Two Israeli security guards dressed in traditional dark blue
jackets and with ear pieces, stood at the entrance of the press
room at a Tel Aviv hotel and scanned reporters who entered the
room. It was not clear if the two men were armed. The guards will
accompany the players throughout their nine-day visit which
includes trips to Holy sites.
	   Security has been beefed up throughout Israel since the missile
strikes last Thursday.

Report: Mitsubishi Electric, Lockheed Martin agree on tie-up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Mitsubishi Electric Corp. and Lockheed
Martin Corp. of the United States have agreed to jointly develop
and market military equipment to Japan's Defense Agency, a
newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Through the agreement, Mitsubishi hopes to boost its military
research and development efficiency by adopting U.S. technologies,
the Nihon Keizai newspaper reported.
	   The tie-up, agreed Monday, also reflects Lockheed's drive to
expand its Japanese market share, the paper, Japan's top business
daily, said. It quoted company sources in reporting the deal.
	   Lockheed Martin, based in based in Bethesda, Maryland, is the
biggest defense contractor in the United States.
	   The linkup reportedly includes cooperating in missile-mounted
electronic devices and weapons-control systems, electronic war
systems and radar devices mounted on aircraft and ships.
	   In addition to exchanging technologies and marketing data,
Mitsubishi and Lockheed will jointly propose new products to the
Defense Agency.
	   Lockheed will also regard Mitsubishi as a top candidate when it
negotiates licensing agreements with Japanese companies, the paper
said.
	   Details of the agreement were still being worked out. The
partners are expected to sign a formal accord soon. Initially they
will develop missile-guidance equipment, the report said.
	   Lockheed, with annual sales of U.S. dlrs 28 billion, has long
been the top U.S. marketer of defense equipment in Japan, the paper
said.
	   But it has recently seen orders fall as Japan's budget for
front-line defense equipment, such as aircraft and ships, shrank to
798 billion yen (dlrs 5.5 billion) in fiscal 1998, down from a peak
of 1.07 trillion yen (dlrs 7.4 billion) in fiscal 1990, the report
said.
	   Mitsubishi is Japan's third-largest defense contractor, and
sells about 130 billion yen (dlrs 903 million) worth of equipment
to the Defense Agency each year, according to the report.

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A soil sample obtained clandestinely by U.S.
intelligence led the Clinton administration to conclude that a
Sudanese plant purported to be making medicine was actually
developing a key ingredient in deadly VX nerve gas, a U.S.
intelligence official said Monday. The Shifa Pharmaceuticals plant
in Khartoum, Sudan, was destroyed last Thursday in a U.S. cruise
missile attack at the same time that Navy-launched missiles struck
at a suspected terrorist base in eastern Afghanistan. In an echo of
the controversy over the bombing of a purported baby milk factory
during the Gulf War, Sudanese officials have protested to the
United Nations that the plant made medicine, not weapons.
(US-BOMBINGS)
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo rejected a proposed cease-fire on
Monday as its allied forces captured former rebel strongholds,
including the key Congo River port town of Matadi in the country's
west. Information Minister Didier Mumengi said Congolese and
Angolan forces had retaken Matadi _ the only major port town on the
Congo River. Angolan state radio RNA reported Monday that the
rebels fighting Kabila's government were holed up at the town of
Inga, near Matadi. Inga is the site of a key power dam that
supplies Kinshasa and southern Congo with its electricity. The
report did not give its sources. The rebels were threatening to
blow up the dam if they were not given guarantees for their
surrender which they were negotiating with Kabila's troops, the RNA
report said. (CONGO)
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A deal on an Israeli troop withdrawal
seemed closer Monday, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
reportedly dropping a key precondition to an agreement and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat warming to Israeli ideas.
Palestinian negotiators confirmed Israel has softened its position
but said that differences were still unresolved regarding an
American proposal for an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent
of the West Bank. Netanyahu's aide, David Bar-Illan said that
Israel was ``considering the American ideas of 13 percent if they
are divided into two parts,'' he told The Associated Press.
(ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   VELIKA RIBORA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Stone-faced or crying, hundreds
of new refugees fled Serb tank fire Monday, as the drive to snuff
out ethnic Albanian guerrillas fighting for Kosovo's independence
moved nearer to the capital of the Serbian province. Dirt roads
meandering through the cornfields south of Pristina were dotted
with tractors or horses pulling trailers piled with women and
children trying to find safety from the newest assault. Blerim
Sadiku, driving a horse-drawn carriage with his family, mattresses
and belongings piled in the back, was fleeing the area. ``It was
too dangerous to stay,'' he said. Asked where they were headed, he
replied: ``We have no idea. We have to ask someone for shelter.''
(YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The World Jewish Congress says it expects
leading European insurance companies to sign an agreement within
days to resolve unpaid Holocaust-era policies. Several insurance
companies said Monday the remaining obstacle to an agreement was
the makeup of an international commission which would develop a
common process to pay Holocaust survivors. ``We've spoken with
them. We expect it to be signed by all remaining insurance
companies within days, perhaps a week,'' said Elan Steinberg,
executive director of the World Jewish Congress. The agreement,
independent of pending lawsuits, was made by the World Jewish
Congress, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and
European insurance companies. (US-HOLOCAUST-INSURANCE)

	   LONDON (AP) _ The Spice Girls said Monday they may add ``two new
members to the Spice family'' _ a statement that didn't quite
confirm published reports that two members of the pop group are
pregnant.
	   News reports have said that Posh Spice Victoria Adams is
expecting a child with her soccer-star boyfriend David Beckham, and
that Scary Spice Melanie Brown and her man, dancer Jimmy Gulzar,
are also expecting.
	   A statement released by the group's publicists said: ``We are
sisters and love each other, and love being together as a band and
as friends. We plan to continue on, perhaps adding two new members
to the Spice family.
	   ``Until such a time as we are sure of our news and ready to make
a statement we would like to appeal to people to give us privacy
during this time.''
	   The statement then went on to plug the group's forthcoming album
and two British concert dates.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ A 53-year-old English woman says that she was a
half-sister of the late John Lennon.
	   The Sun newspaper on Monday printed copies of birth and adoption
certificates of Ingride Pedersen, who was born Victoria Elizabeth
Lennon in Liverpool to Julia Lennon, the Beatle's mother.
	   Lennon's father left his mother when the boy was 3, and the girl
reportedly was the result of the mother's brief affair with a
soldier.
	   Ms. Pedersen, of Chandlers Ford, England, said she felt free to
claim her relationship to John Lennon since her adoptive mother
died in July.
	   ``Now at last I can admit who I am - the little sis John loved
but could never find,'' The Sun quoted her as saying. ``I kept this
secret for the sake of my mum. But now she's dead I want to find my
real family.''
	   On Tuesday, the Sun quoted John Lennon's cousin Stan Parkes as
saying: ``John didn't know of his sister's existence until 1964 and
he did everything in his power to find her.
	   ``He wanted to make her part of the family and look after her,''
the Sun quoted him as saying.
	   The newspaper also quotes a former Beatles tour technician as
saying Lennon searched for his long-lost sister, but never found
her.

	   Romania's cash-strapped government is lining up a luxury package
for tourists with a taste for the unusual: a stay at palaces and
villas belonging to the late Communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu.
	   A night at one of Ceausescu's homes will probably cost dlrs
3,000 to dlrs 4,000, said Mihai Nica, a government official.
	   ``Guests will get a really special reception,'' he said Monday.
``They will be able to relax and at the same time think this
belonged to Ceausescu.''
	   The tours, which will include hunting, will probably start next
spring.
	   Ceausescu and his wife were executed during an anti-Communist
revolt in 1989.

	   LONDON (AP) _ A student was convicted Monday of daubing paint on
a Rembrandt in the National Gallery and running naked near the
Houses of Parliament in a protest against ``society's injustices.''
	   Vincent Bethell, 26, admitted streaking at Parliament Square on
June 26 and taking off his clothes, then painting a yellow sign for
the British pound across a self-portrait of Rembrandt on Aug. 4.
	   The painting wasn't damaged.
	   Bethell will be sentenced in mid-September.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Elvis Presley fans disappointed over the
planned demolition of Market Square Arena will have to settle for a
plaque commemorating his final live concert.
	   Mayor Stephen Goldsmith dedicated the plaque Monday at the site
of the June 26, 1977, show. Presley died on Aug. 16 that year.
	   ``It is only fitting that an appropriate monument be on display
to remember The King's final concert,'' Goldsmith said in a
statement. ``His devoted fans deserve to be recognized for their
enthusiasm and steadfastness.''
	   The mayor's office received letters from as far away as Spain
and the Netherlands asking for a tribute. The letters were prompted
by an article in a fan publication about the planned demolition of
the arena, the home of the Indiana Pacers.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ What's Janet Jackson's idea of sexy?
	   She's on tour with a bevy of female dancers who pick a guy from
the audience, tie him to a chair and do a striptease to her new
song ``Rope Burn.''
	   ``To me, there's nothing wrong with being blindfolded and having
your hands bound and anticipating your lover's every move,'' she
said in the October issue of Jane magazine.
	   ``To me, that is ... it's very sexy. It's about experimenting
and exploring. ... That's what 'Rope Burn' is about.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BEVERLY HILLS, California (AP) _ A puppet replica of Steven
Spielberg sold for dlrs 16,500 during an auction of works by
puppeteers Sid and Marty Krofft.
	   The puppet, dressed in a red shirt and gray sweater and wearing
metal eyeglasses, was valued at dlrs 3,000 to dlrs 5,000 before the
auction Sunday.
	   The sale featured dozens of characters from the TV shows ``H.R.
Pufnstuf,'' ``Lidsville,'' ``Land of the Lost'' and ``D.C.
Follies.''
	   Claudia de Llano, a publicist for the auction, said she didn't
know who bought the Spielberg puppet. Representatives for Michael
Jackson bought 15 items, she said. She didn't know how much he
paid.

Fernandez ousts No. 8 seed Van Roost; Coetzer defeats Serna

<TEXT>
	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ Mary Joe Fernandez won 11 straight
games en route to a 3-6, 6-0, 6-1 victory over Belgium's Dominique
Van Roost on Monday in the first round of Pilot Pen International.
	   Fernandez rallied after the first set with solid play, throwing
the eighth-seeded Van Roost off her game with deep groundstrokes.
	   ``What can you do when you play somebody like that who doesn't
give you a chance to play your game?'' said Van Roost, ranked No.
13 in the world.
	   Russian sensation Anna Kournikova, ranked No. 14 in the world,
was slated to play Austrian Barbara Schett in a night match.
	   South African Amanda Coetzer lost a 3-0 lead after two quick
breaks in the first set against Spaniard Magui Serna, but held on
to win 7-6 (8-6), 6-3.
	   Coetzer, the No. 7 seed, hit a series of backhand winners, but
also was helped by Serna's mistakes.
	   ``I think she really gave me a couple,'' said Coetzer, who won
the tiebreaker after falling behind 4-1.
	   Serna beat German star Steffi Graf in the third round of the du
Maurier tournament last week in Montreal.
	   Coetzer will face Kournikova if the 17-year-old phenom wins the
evening match. Coetzer leads the series against Kournikova 3-2. The
two last met in 1997 in Filderstadt, Germany, where Coetzer won in
three sets and reached that tournament's semifinals.
	   ``We know each other's games pretty well. I think my game
matches well against her's,'' Coetzer said. ``She's a good
competitor and she's tough to play''
	   The field includes Wimbledon champ Jana Novotna, Lindsay
Davenport, the No. 2 player in the world, and No. 4-ranked Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario.

Palmer gets warm welcome at Fred Meyer

<TEXT>
	   ALOHA, Oregon (AP) _ Arnold Palmer, playing in his last
tournament before undergoing follow-up radiation therapy for
prostate cancer, was met by huge crowds and shouts of encouragement
at every hole Monday in the opening round of the Fred Meyer
Challenge.
	   ``Arnold Palmer, God love you, sir!'' one fan said to Palmer,
68, as he approached the first tee of the two-day charity event.
	   The cheers didn't let up the rest of the day, even when Palmer
and his partner, tournament host Peter Jacobsen, began to fade
after making birdies on three of the first five holes.
	   Palmer and Jacobsen finished with a 5-under-par 67 in the
best-ball format, four strokes behind leaders Craig Stadler and
Steve Elkington.
	   Palmer and Jacobsen had just one bogey and Palmer made up for
Jacobsen's shaky play with five birdies.
	   ``The crowds have been wonderful to me, especially here,''
Palmer said. ``I think they are sincere with their best wishes.
It's the reason I continue to play.''
	   Palmer, who turns 69 next month, will begin daily treatments
Aug. 31 at a hospital near his home in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. He
had successful surgery last year, but the radiation treatment is a
precautionary measure against recurrence of the cancer.
	   Palmer said doctors will allow him to play golf during his
seven-week radiation therapy, but not competitively. He said,
however, that he will return to competition once he is cleared to
play.
	   ``As long as I can get in there and make five birdies, I'll
continue to do that,'' he said. ``I feel wonderful.''
	   Jacobsen, who has been Palmer's partner in the Fred Meyer
Challenge in each of its 14 years, said: ``He played unbelievable.
I thought, `If I can help him at all, we'll have a chance.'''
	   Stadler and Elkington birdied their last four holes to take the
one-stroke lead over Stewart Cink and Steve Jones, who had birdies
on five of the last seven holes.
	   Two teams _ Brad Faxon and Billy Andrade, and Jim Furyk and
David Duval _ were at 65 and three other teams were another stroke
back heading into Tuesday's final round.
	   Stadler and Elkington were three under par at the turn before
surging on the back nine of the new Reserve Vineyards and Golf Club
west of Portland. They birdied Nos. 12, 13, 15, 17 and 18.

Dollar lower on intervention fears, Tokyo stocks rebound
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen early Tuesday
on continuing fears of yen-supportive intervention by Japanese
monetary authorities. Tokyo stock prices rebounded.
	   The dollar bought 143.58 yen in early trading, down 0.82 yen
from 144.40 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New
York rate of 143.95 yen overnight.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
jumped 204.90 points, or 1.37 percent, to 15,193.26 points in the
first 30 minutes of trading. On Wednesday, the Nikkei average lost
309.84 points, or 2.03 percent.
	   The yen gained after overseas investors dumped dollars for the
Japanese currency following comments in Monday's Wall Street
Journal by Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's vice finance minister for
international affairs.
	   ``Intervention is one of the effective instruments we have,''
Sakakibara told the paper. One of Sakakibara's deputies made
similar comments.
	   ``The market's caution against intervention is extremely
strong,'' said Yoneo Sakai, general manager of the international
treasury division at Fuji Bank in Tokyo.
	   Other traders said U.S. hedge funds were selling dollars for yen
to book profits to offset losses incurred from investment in Russia
and other emerging markets.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, prices rebounded following Monday's
steep decline, when the Nikkei closed below the
psychologically-significant 15,000-point level for the first time
in a week.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 9.39 points, or 0.81 percent, to 1,167.69 in
early trading. The TOPIX closed down 18.21 points, or 1.55 percent,
the day before.
	   Prices gained following the overnight rise on Wall Street and
news of a new government in Russia.
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 32.96 points
_ or 0.4 percent _ to 8,566.61, while in Moscow, President Boris
Yeltsin reinstated Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister to tackle
the country's financial crisis.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 192 10-year Japanese government
bond was unchanged from Wednesday's finish of 1.135 percent. Its
price also remained steady at Monday's 112.19 yen.

Little changes in Congolese town after second rebellion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Congo &QL; 
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Two years ago, shells slammed into this
eastern lakeside town where former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko's
troops were pillaging shops and commandeering cars to escape
President Laurent Kabila's rebels.
	   Less than three weeks ago, shop owners slammed their shutters
and confused residents locked their homes once again when
disgruntled soldiers declared an insurgency against Kabila.
	   But no looting or shooting came in Congo's second revolt in two
years. Instead, the mutinous troops announced they were the
people's army and patrolled the streets sporting funky sun glasses
and joking with the residents.
	   ``We feared the worst,'' one shop owner said. ``But the second,
third day nothing happened. We went about our lives, and things
look fine now.''
	   The border with Rwanda reopened, familiar cross-border trade
resumed and shops and banks opened for business.
	   On the surface, little has changed after the rebel takeover: the
yellow-starred flag on a field of blue remained the same. So did
the name of the country, administrators, banknotes and even the
soldiers.
	   In the small town of Goma, it was the 16,000-strong 10th Brigade
_ the largest in the country _ that took up arms first, probably
with the help from neighboring Rwanda.
	   The rebels were originally part of Mobutu's Zairian Armed Forces
and joined Kabila's movement on promises of a new beginning, free
of corruption and nepotism, for the vast central African nation
rich in natural resources.
	   But they grew disenchanted when their new commander-in-chief
failed to deliver paychecks, then slighted them by surrounding
himself with officers from his native Katanga. After he fired a
Rwandan Tutsi, Kabila first named his brother-in-law, then his son,
Joseph, as army chief of staff.
	   In July, he made the rebellion possible by ordering the Rwandan
troops and instructors who helped him topple Mobutu out of the
country, apparently afraid they had too much control over his army
_ the only real power in the country.
	   Ethnic Tutsi soldiers, fearing the same persecution they had
endured under Mobutu, spearheaded the rebellion and were soon
joined by troops from other parts of Congo.
	   Last week, opposition leaders, exiled academics and politicians
joined on board and formed the Congolese Coalition Movement, a
government-in-waiting preparing to take power from Kabila.
	   They grouped Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, an exiled professor; Arthur
Ngoma, an opposition leader who was jailed by Kabila then escaped
to Belgium; Bizima Karaha, Kabila's former foreign minister.
	   The rebels called upon other opposition groups to join in,
promising no discrimination, a broad-based government and free
elections.
	   So far, the example of Goma appeared reassuring.
	   ``We're fighting for democracy, not autocracy,'' rebel commander
Jean-Pierre Ondekane said. ``The disciplined army is the basis for
our success.''
	   Uniformed men joined by occasional female soldiers shake hands
with journalists and pose for pictures _ something rarely seen
during past regimes.
	   Although armed, they interact easily with civilians and obey
orders from their commanders.
	   Bands of teenagers known in a combination of French and Swahili
as ``les kidogos'' or ``the young ones,'' patrol the narrow, rocky
streets of Goma with Kalashnikov rifles.
	   Army commanders say most of them will be sent home or to school.

Urban breadwinners' deaths in bombing impoverish rural families
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NAI103
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Lucy Nyawira Karigi's life was a story of
the one and the many.
	   A Kenyan consular assistant who died in the car-bombing of the
U.S. Embassy, her generous spirit was the financial lifeblood of an
extended Kikuyu family. She raised her dead sister's children; she
put cousins through school; she built a home for her aged parents.
	   ``She was like the mother of us all,'' said her niece, Caroline
Karigi, who with her aunt's help is now studying at a college in
New Jersey.
	   The story of Lucy Karigi _ who, at 53, had worked at the embassy
for almost three decades _ is extraordinary, yet not particularly
unusual in the culture in which she lived.
	   In Kenya, as in much of Africa, strong ties of the extended
family _ and the enormous disparity between earnings in the city
and the countryside _ make it commonplace for a single urban
breadwinner to be the main source of support for dozens of other
family members.
	   So now, more than two weeks after the attack on the U.S. Embassy
killed 247 people _ almost all of them Kenyan passers-by or workers
in an adjacent office building _ the blast's reverberations are
spreading to distant villages, touching hundreds of lives.
	   Aid workers liken it to a giant and fragile inverted pyramid, in
which the death or disabling of a single worker can have
catastrophic results.
	   A Red Cross official in Nairobi, John Sparrow, told of an
encounter with a 35-year-old woman who traveled to the capital from
her village, frantic with worry after her driver husband failed to
return home the weekend after the bombing.
	   More than a week later, she finally found his body in the
morgue, burned almost beyond recognition. By that time, she had
spent nearly all the family's meager savings on her stay in Nairobi
_ and would be spending the rest on his funeral.
	   The dead man was the eldest of 11 children, with younger
brothers and sisters depending on him, as well as his own wife and
three children.
	   The embassy, along with the Red Cross and other agencies, is
working on plans to help dependents of the dead and injured, but
logistical problems alone will be enormous.
	   ``It's impossible to put a figure on how many are affected in
this way,'' Sparrow said. ``And it will be very difficult to even
determine where they are.''
	   One such place is Lucy Karigi's home village of Ngandu, in the
cool central Kenyan highlands 120 miles (193 kilometers) north of
Nairobi, where most of her family still lives. She grew up in a
thatched-roof hut with no running water or electricity.
	   On Tuesday, family members who had gathered in her clean but
simple apartment in a rundown Nairobi housing project smiled
despite their grief when asked how many people in the village had
depended on Lucy's assistance.
	   She provided the bulk of support for an extended family of about
30 people, they said.
	   ``She was paying my children's school fees,'' said her sister,
Eunice Karigi, a careworn 38-year-old who works in Ngandu's fields.
	   ``She was working to get a visa for my daughter to go and study
in America,'' said her cousin, Martin Wachira Ruitta.
	   ``All our help is now cut off,'' said her tall and dignified
uncle, 61-year-old Charles Wachira.
	   Twenty years ago, when her sister died, Lucy brought her two
nephews and niece, then ages 2, 4 and 6, to live with her in
Nairobi. They described her as strict but loving, never too tired
after a day at work to cook a family meal and ask them how their
day had gone.
	   Lucy Karigi's determination to help younger relatives get an
education grew out of her own struggles. For a family of
subsistence farmers like hers, school fees, though relatively
small, were an impossible expense.
	   Her family recalled how she helped work off her own fees by
tending rabbits her mission school raised. She left home for
Nairobi so she could go to secretarial school and get a good job _
the job that became her family's lifeline.
	   ``She used to tell us, `Work hard, live by your own sweat,'''
said the eldest of the children she raised, 26-year-old Caroline
Karigi, who is now studying computer science at Middlesex College
in Addison, New Jersey.
	   ``If I'm able, I want to be like her,'' she said.

Sides softening position, deal on withdrawal reportedly emerging
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ After 17 months of stalemate, Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat are reportedly softening their positions and near a deal on
a long overdue Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
	   U.S. envoy Dennis Ross was meeting with both sides to work out
the details of an American-sponsored agreement calling for Israel
to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank, Israel radio
reported.
	   The Haaretz newspaper said in its Tuesday edition that officials
were hoping a deal could be wrapped up in time for a Sept. 13
ceremony at the White House, the fifth anniversary of the historic
signing of the first Israeli-Palestinian peace accords.
	   Arafat called new Israeli ideas on Monday ``a beginning.'' In
Oslo, Norway, where that first peace agreement was negotiated,
Arafat said he ``would accept'' an Israeli-proposed formula to turn
part of the land slated for withdrawal into a nature reserve.
	   Israel radio reported that in a written agreement, Israeli had
loosened its definition of a nature reserve. The issue was the main
sticking point in reaching a deal.
	   Quoting Israeli diplomatic sources, the radio said that Israel
was now offering Palestinian police freedom of movement and limited
construction within a 3 percent area of the West Bank.
	   Israel would withdraw its troops from that area and convert it
into a nature reserve, which would be part of a larger region in
which Palestinians control civil affairs but overall security is
left to Israel.
	   The Palestinians had previously rejected the idea because it
altered the original American initiative and restricted the use of
the land.
	   Netanyahu aide David Bar-Illan said the premier was
``considering the American ideas of 13 percent if they are divided
into two parts.'' Netanyahu had originally rejected a withdrawal
from more than 9 percent.
	   Ross was reportedly working with both sides in Oslo to wrap up
the deal. Ross, along with Arafat and Israeli officials, was in the
Norwegian capital for a ceremony marking five years since the first
accords were secretly negotiated there.
	   Israel radio reported that representatives of the CIA and
Palestinian security officials have begun drawing up a new
agreement on fighting terrorism that Ross is overseeing. Israel has
said that no deal could be completed with Palestinian assurances on
fighting militants.
	   Officials in Jerusalem said the results of a Ross-Arafat meeting
in Oslo would determine whether the American mediator would return
to the area to complete the deal, Israel radio reported.
	   Ross said Monday that differences had narrowed but added: ``We
won't have a breakthrough until we have an agreement.''
	   A separate conflict over the current status of the Palestinian
charter also seemed resolved Monday.
	   Israel had demanded that the Palestinians convene the 545-member
Palestine National Council to remove ambiguity about whether it had
canceled clauses in the PLO charter calling for Israel's
destruction.
	   Palestinians say they have already revoked the charter. A senior
Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Israel
was now ready to start the withdrawal if the Palestinians promise
to change the charter within four months of phased pullbacks.
	   In a 1997 U.S.-sponsored accord, Israel promised to turn over
West Bank land to the Palestinians in three separate withdrawals to
be completed by mid-1998. Last spring, Israel decided to carry out
a first pullback from 2 percent, but the offer was rejected by the
Palestinians as too small and never carried out.
	   After months of stalemate, the United States offered its 13
percent proposal in January. The Palestinians accepted the proposal
but Israel did not and the sides have been haggling over the ideas
since then.

Last defendant stands trial for street kid slayings

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Five years after the murder of
eight street kids in downtown Rio, the last defendant went on trial
Monday for a crime that has come to symbolize police brutality.
	   Marcos Aurelio Dias Alcantara, a former Rio de Janeiro military
state policeman, recanted a 1996 confession and pleaded innocent to
eight charges of murder and six of attempted murder.
	   Dias is the sixth defendant to stand trial for the 1993
killings. One ex-policeman officer has been found guilty and
another convicted of attempted murder. Three defendants were
acquitted, and another was killed before coming to trial.
	   Unlike the banner-waving protests that marked the early trials,
only TV camera crews called attention at the downtown courthouse.
Still, rights defenders say the verdict will send a message.
	   ``It would be nice to get a conviction as a symbolic statement
attacking police violence and death squad killings,'' said James
Cavallaro, head of Human Rights Watch/Americas in Brazil.
	   ``The prosecution has done a lot less than we expected,'' he
added. ``But at least a conviction breaks the cycle of guaranteed
impunity.''
	   Prosecutors say Dias was among the gunmen who attacked dozens of
children sleeping on the sidewalk near Candelaria Cathedral on July
23, 1993. Six were killed on the spot, and two others were driven
to the waterfront and killed.
	   A survivor, Wagner dos Santos, identified police as the
shooters. He now lives in Switzerland for his protection and did
not show up to testify on Monday.
	   Patricia Oliveira, one of Santos' sisters said there was no need
for him to be in court because he already testified.
	   ``We speak to Wagner regularly and he has told us he is
convinced Dias is guilty,'' she said.
	   Santos' accusations confirmed what many Brazilians suspected.
Rights defenders say shopkeepers in high-crime districts routinely
pay policemen to kill children suspected of stealing.
	   An estimated 2,000 to 3,000 children, most of them homeless or
runaways, live on the streets of this city of 6 million.
	   Although Dias faces a maximum sentence of more than 300 years,
under Brazilian law he cannot serve more than 30. And a sentence of
20 years for one crime guarantees the defendant an automatic
retrial.
	   The only policeman convicted of the murders, Marcus Vinicius
Emmanuel, drew a 309-year sentence that later was reduced to 89
years at his retrial. Nelson Oliveira dos Santos Cunha, originally
sentenced to 261 years for the eight murders, was acquitted at his
retrial and his sentence reduced to 18 years for one charge of
attempted murder.
	   Meanwhile, the trial has done nothing to improve the lives of
street kids, said Cristina Leonardo, a lawyer for the victims.
	   ``More and more seem to be working with drug traffickers,'' she
said. ``Nothing has changed. If anything, things have gotten
worse.''
	   Leonardo said the verdict was not expected until Tuesday.

	   ROSEAU, Dominica (AP) _ Searchers found the wreckage Monday of a
commuter airplane that crashed on the Caribbean island of Dominica,
killing 10 people. An 11-year-old boy survived but was in critical
condition.
	   The twin-engine Cessna 402 was operated by Air Anguilla and was
flying from St. Martin on a flight for Dominica's Cardinal Airlines
when it crashed Sunday.
	   The boy, Kelly John, was found unconscious in the wreckage and
was taken to a local hospital. He was in critical condition Monday
afternoon with a skull fracture and a broken leg.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A bus overturned in a mountainous area near
Mexico City on Monday, killing at least eight people and injuring
25, the government's Notimex news agency reported.
	   The bus overturned near Platanar about 40 miles southwest of
Mexico City and 15 miles west of Cuernavaca.
	   Four of the injured were reportedly in serious condition,
according to Notimex.
	   ___
	   ALMOLOYA DE JUAREZ, Mexico (AP) _ Accused kidnapper Daniel
Arizmendi Lopez and two alleged members of his gang were held for
trial Monday under Mexico's relatively new organized-crime laws.
	   The three face charges of racketeering and illegal weapons
possession. Arizmendi still faces a hearing on kidnapping and money
laundering charges.
	   Arizmendi is known as ``the Ear Lopper'' for his practice of
cutting off the ears of kidnap victims to pressure family members
to meet ransom demands.
	   Along with a male accomplice, Arizmendi's mistress _ Dulce Paz
Venegas _ was also held for trial at a hearing inside a maximum
security prison near Mexico City.
	   Paz Venegas has not been charged with participating in the
actual kidnappings, but faces money laundering charges for
allegedly helping Arizmendi spend ransom money.
	   ___
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Political parties nominated more than
450 candidates on Monday to contest Jamaica's long-postponed local
government elections on Sept. 10.
	   The ruling People's National Party said it fielded a full slate
of candidates for the 227 parish council and municipal seats, while
the opposition Jamaica Labour Party said it nominated 225.
	   Elections officials did not immediately have totals for smaller
parties or independent candidates.
	   Local government elections are supposed to take place every
three years in Jamaica but were last held in March 1990. The
government has postponed them repeatedly, saying it wants to
establish measures against voter fraud, that include new types of
identification cards and a fingerprinting system.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Police here are handing out more traffic
tickets, but also are charging more for street-corner bribes, a
newspaper reported Monday.
	   The daily Cronica said it posted reporters at major
intersections and interviewed drivers after encounters with traffic
police.
	   It said they reported paying about 80 pesos (dlrs 8.90) to avoid
a ticket for running a red light, 65 pesos (dlrs 7.20) for failure
to use a seatbelt and 120 pesos (dlrs 13.30) for illegal parking.
	   The newspaper said those ``fines'' had commonly averaged 25, 40
and 70 pesos until recently.
	   Official figures show some evidence that a crackdown on bribes
has had some effect.
	   Through the first five months of 1998, police had given out
48,654 traffic citations, up from 26,654 for the same period a year
ago.
	   Officials in recent decades have repeatedly announced campaigns
to wipe out traffic bribes.
	   ___
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Chiapas state police
called in to settle a fight among farm workers fired into a crowd,
killing one person and wounding about six, prosecutors said. Six
officers were arrested.
	   It's not clear what caused the dispute Sunday at the communal
farm Nuevo Limar in Norteno de Tila, about 180 miles north of San
Cristobal de las Casas in this southern state.
	   When police arrived they were attacked by farm workers, some of
whom were drunk and tried to take their guns, the state attorney
general's office said. At least one police officer started to fire,
killing a man identified as Eulalio Mendez Gutierrez.
	   In addition to the police, several farm workers were arrested.
	   The farm is considered a base for a pro-government vigilante
group known as ``Peace and Justice,'' but the dispute was not
believed to be related to the conflict between government
supporters and sympathizers of the Zapatista guerrillas, who staged
a brief uprising 4{ years ago.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Despite an American attack last week that
wrecked Sudan's largest pharmaceutical plant, troubled relations
between the two countries that soured almost a decade ago will soon
become better, Sudan's parliament speaker says.
	   The remarks by Hassan Turabi, the man considered the real power
behind the Islamic government, stand in sharp contrast to several
days of rallies and protests in Khartoum, where demonstrators have
denounced the United States and President Bill Clinton in
particular.
	   ``I still believe that we hit the bottom and that we will rise.
I think so, I think so. That's not only a wish,'' told The
Associated Press on Monday. ``I don't think it will take too
long.''
	   The United States launched a missile attack Thursday on El Shifa
Pharmaceutical Industries Co. on the outskirts of Khartoum,
destroying the plant's three factories. Washington has said the
plant, which provided at least one-third of Sudan's domestic drug
market, was manufacturing precursors for VX nerve gas.
	   The attack culminated years of deteriorating relations with
Sudan's government, which took power in a military coup in 1989
that overthrew a democratically elected government.
	   Soon after, the United States cut all but humanitarian aid. It
later added Sudan to its list of countries supporting terrorism,
imposed trade sanctions and withdrew its diplomats from the
capital.
	   But Turabi said he believed U.S. policy, which he described as
pragmatic, would see the benefits of better ties. Sudan is Africa's
largest country, and Turabi said its economy would soon prosper by
virtue of its fertile land, abundant water and natural resources.
	   ``It's not just another country to disregard, and it's not a
hostile enemy to Christians, to Americans,'' he said.
	   But, in somewhat contradictory tones, he promised that the U.S.
attack on the factory would not be easily dismissed.
	   ``All the Sudanese now actually see the United States,
generally, as the incarnation of the devil, of evil,'' Turabi said
in the interview at his home, decorated with framed Koranic verses
and a picture of the Kaaba, Islam's holiest shrine.
	   He called the attack ``most criminal, most savage'' and, like
other Sudanese leaders, he accused Clinton of launching the strike
to divert attention from scandals at home.
	   ``He was haunted with attacks against his matrimonial loyalty
and credibility and, besides that, even his credibility vis-a-vis
the nation, in courts, in Congress,'' Turabi said.
	   Turabi, an urbane lawyer with degrees from universities in
Britain and France, is a renowned survivor. He has been a fixture
of Sudanese politics since 1965, holding posts under five regimes.
	   Over a generation, his cadres in the National Islamic Front
infiltrated the bureaucracy, army, unions and banks, finally
seizing control with the military in 1989 in the only revolution to
bring an Islamic government to power in the Arab world.
	   To his supporters, he is a savvy political and religious leader,
creating a bold experiment in Islamic rule.
	   But his detractors, both at home and abroad, accuse him of
organizing a pervasive and ruthless police state and supporting
Islamic militants, either by providing refuge or setting up
training camps. He called the charges ``absolute sheer nonsense.''
	   One militant who took refuge in Sudan was Osama bin Laden, the
exiled Saudi millionaire the United States accused of orchestrating
the bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. In Sudan,
his company built a road from the capital and an airport.
	   Bin Laden left Sudan in 1996 for Afghanistan, where he fought
Soviet troops in the 1980s. His departure from Sudan was by choice,
according to Turabi, who defended him as a hero.
	   ``Anyone who resists power or persecution, if you like him you
call him resistance, a freedom fighter, a revolutionary,'' said
Turabi, dressed in a white robe and turban. ``It's only when you
don't like him you use another language, that he's a terrorist.''
	   Turabi said he did not believe bin Laden had a role in the
embassy bombings, attacks that he said he understood.
	   ``There may be people who feel, `What can they do?''' Turabi
said. ``It would be an understandable act, not a justified one.''
	   Turabi defended Sudan's right to have chemical weapons, but said
it had neither the attention nor the means to acquire them.
	   ``What do we need chemical weapons for?'' he asked.

Parliament to be recalled for emergency anti-terror legislation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Parliament will be recalled from its summer recess
next week to pass tougher anti-terror laws in the wake of the Omagh
bombing, according to press reports Tuesday.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair was expected to announce the
emergency recall later on Tuesday, when he was due to visit Omagh
for the first time since the Aug. 15 car bomb exploded, killing 28
and injuring more than 330 in the worst terrorist attack in
Northern Ireland's history.
	   A spokeswoman in his Downing Street official residence Monday
night confirmed press reports that Blair will announce the recall
of legislators Tuesday.
	   Press reports said the House of Commons and House of Lords would
be recalled next Tuesday and Wednesday to enact laws designed to
secure easier convictions against members of terrorist groups who
did not endorse the Good Friday peace agreement setting out how
Northern Ireland would be governed.
	   One of those groups, Irish Republican Army dissidents known as
the Real IRA, has admitted being behind the bombing in Omagh 70
miles (110 kms) west of Belfast.
	   The Irish parliament will also be recalled for a one-day session
on Sept. 2, Dublin government sources confirmed Monday night,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern signaled the return of the
Dail from its summer recess last week, when he unveiled the
toughest set of security and anti-terrorist proposals in the
history of the Irish state in response to the Omagh bombing.
	   Most of the measures to be pursued by the Irish government are
already in place in Britain, but Blair was expected to unveil plans
to make it easier to put bombers and gunmen behind bars through
evidence of membership of an illegal terrorist organization based
on the testimony of a police officer.
	   Until now, convicting people of simple membership of the IRA or
other outlawed groups has been extremely difficult, because the
groups keep no written records of membership, senior members do not
involve themselves directly in committing attacks, and potential
civilian witnesses run the risk of being killed as informers.
	   New measures will have been passed north and south of the Irish
border by the time U.S. President Bill Clinton arrives in Belfast
next Thursday, The Times reported Tuesday.
	   Blair and ministers have decided that primary legislation _
requiring the recall of parliament _ was needed to make the new
anti-terrorist measures watertight, The Times reported.
	   Opposition politicians welcomed the report of a recall. Andrew
Mackay, Northern Ireland secretary for the Conservative Party said
his party would offer swift passage to any additional
anti-terrorist measures which the security forces believed would
help to bring ``these evil psychopaths'' to justice.

Beer fuels economic recovery in Bulgaria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo &QL; 
 &UR; By VESELIN ZHELEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ What fuels Bulgarian market reform? It's
beer, the only sector in this former Communist country that isn't
flat _ growing seven times faster than the national economy.
	   Brewing is the only industry in this Balkan country that has
been almost fully privatized. Of 13 breweries, 12 are already in
private hands, attracting over dlrs 30 million of foreign
investment.
	   ``It is good time to invest in beer,'' said Oleg Zhablyanov,
owner of a small brewery. ``So far this year, our sales have grown
20 percent over last year.''
	   Zhablyanov, 45, a former television cameraman, and two partners
bought the debt-ridden state brewery last winter and don't regret
the investment.
	   Beer is a hot-seller in Bulgaria, with output expected to grow
30 percent this year, well ahead of the expected 4 percent growth
of the overall national economy.
	   The total beer output is expected to reach 4 million hectoliters
(105 million gallons) this year, according Peter Paunkov, chairman
of the Brewers' Union.
	   Almost all will be consumed domestically, with only about 2
percent exported.
	   ``The demand for beer grows due to the good quality of local
beer, its affordable cost and the hot weather this summer,''
Zhablyanov said.
	   One half-a-liter (1 pint) bottle of Bulgarian beer costs 500
leva (some 30 cents). The average monthly salary is the equivalent
of dlrs 100.
	   The effect has spilled over into related enterprises such as
restaurants, cafes and bars.
	   ``We work around the clock, and the place is overflowing most of
the time,'' said Violeta Georgieva, a 23-year-old chemistry student
working part-time as a waitress at a beer hall in downtown Sofia.
	   Plevensko Pivo, a brewery in northern Bulgaria, built the
two-story, 130-seat beer hall on the site where a monument to
former Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev once stood.
	   Zhablyanov and his partners paid dlrs 700,000 for a 62 percent
stake in their factory. The buyers promised to invest dlrs 550,000
in a new production line and assumed a dlrs 300,000 debt the
company had amassed while in state hands.
	   ``The brewery has been poorly managed,'' Zhablyanov said. ``We
switched it from one to two shifts per day to more efficiently use
the equipment. In June we raised wages by a fifth.''
	   With some 50,000 liters (13,150 gallons) per day, his company is
much smaller than Bulgaria's flagship breweries Zagorka and Astika.
	   Zagorka is owned by Dutch beer giant Heineken and Belgium's
Interbrew holds a controlling interest in Astika, as well as in two
smaller breweries.
	   ``Competition by foreign investors is strong, but we mustn't let
them stamp out local producers,'' Zhablyanov said.
	   Bulgaria, which is known mainly for its wines, has a 100-year
brewing tradition and 50 local brands of beer.
	   But beer has also entered ``politics,'' through what is
popularly dubbed ``The Beer Party,'' modeled after a group founded
in 1911 by Czech satirist and writer Jaroslav Hasek.
	   ``We don't run in elections because we don't want to govern,''
said Lyudmil Mirkov, 40, who owns an advertising agency. ``Not
because we can't. We even know how. But we prefer to drink beer.
Thus we keep the industry going, support investors, and create
jobs.''
	   Corruption, he adds, ``is strictly limited to tips we give to
waiters.''
	   The party, which claims 20,000 members, has held 42
``congresses'' in various Sofia pubs since its creation in December
1989.
	   The party's ``constitution'' contains a simple membership
requirement: ``Anyone who offers us a drink is welcome.''

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Mitsubishi Electric Corp. and Lockheed
Martin Corp. of the United States have agreed to jointly develop
military equipment, a Mitsubishi spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Katsuyuki Hashimoto, of Tokyo-based Mitsubishi, said his company
and Lockheed reached a ``basic agreement'' recently for a broad
tie-up.
	   ``This is the first comprehensive accord between the two
companies,'' Hashimoto said, though he added they have supplied
each other with some parts in the past.
	   Hashimoto said concrete details of the military equipment to be
jointly developed will be worked out later with Lockheed, the
largest defense contractor in the United States. The company is
based in Bethesda, Maryland.
	   Mitsubishi, sold about 130 billion yen (dlrs 903 million) worth
of equipment to the Defense Agency last year and ranked as the
third-largest defense contractor in Japan, the company said.
	   The Nihon Keizai newspaper reported Tuesday that the agreement
will include cooperation in missile-mounted electronic devices and
weapons-control systems, electronic war systems and radar devices
mounted on aircraft and ships.
	   It said they will initially develop missile-guidance equipment.
	   In addition to exchanging technologies and marketing data,
Mitsubishi and Lockheed will jointly propose new products to
Japan's Defense Agency, the newspaper said.
	   Through the agreement, Mitsubishi hopes to boost its military
research and development efficiency by adopting U.S. technologies,
the newspaper said.
	   The report said Lockheed, with annual sales of U.S. dlrs 28
billion, has long been the top U.S. marketer of defense equipment
in Japan.
	   But it has recently seen orders fall as Japan's budget for
front-line defense equipment, such as aircraft and ships, shrank to
798 billion yen (dlrs 5.5 billion) in fiscal 1998, about 30 percent
down from a peak of 1.07 trillion yen (dlrs 7.4 billion) in fiscal
1990, the daily said.

Germany suffers from too much of a good thing: Beer

<TEXT>
	   NEUZELLE, Germany (AP) _ Trouble is building in the land of beer
like foam on a just-poured pilsner: Germany is awash in excess
suds, but fewer people want to drink it.
	   Despite 5,000 brands of beer and centuries of tradition, today's
health-conscious Germans are more likely to reach for an apple
juice or mineral water to quench their thirst.
	   The changing tastes are slowly putting breweries big and small
out of business; 42 in the last five years. Some analysts predict
half of them will be gone in 10 to 20 years.
	   In response, the industry is starting to consolidate and some
big guns are going against the grain of another German tradition _
the preference for distinctive local brews _ to promote their
labels nationwide.
	   Smaller brewers who want to survive try to carve out their own
creative niches.
	   The 400-year-old Cloister Brewery in Neuzelle, near the Polish
border, is staying afloat with such market-expanding innovations as
medicinal ``bathing beer.''
	   Owner Helmut Fritsche also has opened his red brick brewery to
tour groups and is trying to interest health spas in buying his
spent hops for beauty packs.
	   ``You just have to have the ideas,'' he says.
	   Germany, where beer has been made since before Christ was born,
still has way more breweries than the rest of Europe combined _
1,269 in 1997.
	   But the title of world's biggest beer drinkers already has been
lost to the Czechs as sales dry up. The federal statistics office
this month reported another decline, 0.7 percent, for the first
half of 1998.
	   ``In the old days, especially in Bavaria, after church guys
would go and drink a few beers,'' says beer industry consultant
Andrew Hampp at Roland Berger and Partner in Munich. ``Now they're
more likely to spend time with the family and go hiking or
mountain-biking.''
	   Not to say Germans have totally abandoned their liquid staff of
life.
	   The per capita consumption of 131.1 liters (34.5 gallons) in
1997 is down about 10 percent from 10 years ago, but still amounts
to roughly a bottle a day for every man, woman and child.
	   In Bavaria, site of the renowned Oktoberfest and more than half
of Germany's breweries, local officials report the average
four-person family drinks more beer than milk.
	   ``I drink a beer every night,'' says Ulrich Murmann, a
businessman from Nuremberg. ``It's just the best drink there is.''
	   Unfortunately for the industry and tradition, though, more and
more Germans disagree.
	   ``My favorite drinks are vitamin juices and seltzer because
they're healthier,'' says Hildegard Zimmerman, a Berlin housewife
doing her daily shopping.
	   Beer's everyman roots also can hurt.
	   In a recent survey by Berlin's Tageszeitung daily, one student
said beer didn't fit with the ``cultivated image'' she was aiming
for. Another respondent linked beer with neo-Nazi skinheads who get
drunk on cheap suds ``then run through the streets crying `Sieg
Heil!'''
	   Other factors for evaporating sales include exposure through
travel to other drinks, especially wine; anti-drunk driving
campaigns; fitness fads and changing tastes, especially among the
young.
	   The drop in demand exacerbates overcapacity, which has grown
with German unification and the replacement of old equipment with
bigger and better machines.
	   The glut depresses beer prices _ in bars it's cheaper than
mineral water _ while costs keep rising.
	   The biggest brewery group, Brau und Brunnen AG, earned 81
million marks (dlrs 45 million) in 1997 after two years of losses,
but two-thirds of the profit was due to selling off three old
breweries.
	   Analysts estimate the entire industry together barely breaks
even on sales that last year totaled 19.4 billion marks (dlrs 11
billion).
	   Part of the problem is beer's very abundance. So many breweries
mean one can only grow at the expense of another, says Michael
Scherer of the German Brewers Union, a trade group.
	   In the final shakeout, analysts say survivors will probably be
those brewers that can build strong regional or national brands,
and small niche players, like the Neuzelle Cloister Brewery.
	   Secularized by the Prussians in 1817 and nationalized by the
communists after World War II, it was about to be liquidated after
German unification when Fritsche bought it in 1992.
	   After investing 10 million marks (dlrs 6 million), the brewery
is profitable now, Fritsche says, producing a sweet, black brew
according to the monks' original recipe and six other types of
beer, including the bathing variety.
	   ``I'm sad whenever I hear that another small brewery has
closed,'' he says. ``Forgetting old traditions and letting them die
out _ it makes the place less interesting.''

Mitsubishi Electric, Lockheed agree to develop defense equipment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix garble
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with Mitsubishi spokesman confirming
basic agreement reached; edits to tighten &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Mitsubishi Electric Corp. and Lockheed
Martin Corp. of the United States have agreed to jointly develop
military equipment, a Mitsubishi spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Katsuyuki Hashimoto, of Tokyo-based Mitsubishi, said his company
and Lockheed reached a ``basic agreement'' recently for a broad
tie-up.
	   ``This is the first comprehensive accord between the two
companies,'' Hashimoto said, though he added they have supplied
each other with some parts in the past.
	   Hashimoto said concrete details of the military equipment to be
jointly developed will be worked out later with Lockheed, the
largest defense contractor in the United States. The company is
based in Bethesda, Maryland.
	   Mitsubishi, sold about 130 billion yen (dlrs 903 million) worth
of equipment to the Defense Agency last year and ranked as the
third-largest defense contractor in Japan, the company said.
	   The Nihon Keizai newspaper reported Tuesday that the agreement
will include cooperation in missile-mounted electronic devices and
weapons-control systems, electronic war systems and radar devices
mounted on aircraft and ships.
	   It said they will initially develop missile-guidance equipment.

Ignoring the warts, U.S. firms fantasize about a post-embargo Cuba
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY384 &QL; 
 &UR; By BRUCE STANLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ For U.S. companies yearning to profit in a
post-embargo Cuba, manufacturer Scott Alberts offers a sobering
lesson on trying to do business in a communist country.
	   Alberts spent two years developing a gasoline engine especially
for use on bicycles in China. He took another year forming a
joint-venture to sell it and made 12 trips from Burbank,
California, to Beijing before finally securing the approval of
Chinese authorities.
	   Suddenly China changed its laws to give Chinese partners final
say over joint-venture decisions. Alberts, vice president of
Buildit Engineering Co., opposed giving up control, and his project
collapsed.
	   ``If the rules change, there's no way you can win on a
consistent basis,'' he said.
	   American traders are beating a path to Cuba despite the
potential there for similar setbacks.
	   To them the impoverished island represents opportunity _ an
untapped market of 11 million consumers, a trove of seafood, nickel
and other natural resources, and a destination for sun-starved
tourists. Recent signs that Washington may loosen its 36-year
economic embargo on Cuba have stoked their enthusiasm.
	   Behind the hype, however, lurks a distressing reality, say
Americans with experience in Vietnam and China _ two other
communist countries that were subjected to U.S. sanctions. If the
United States lifts its embargo, they say, Americans seeking
business in Cuba should brace for arbitrary rulemaking, inadequate
laws, phony financial records and thickets of red tape.
	   U.S. companies have watched with mounting frustration as foreign
competitors, unhindered by sanctions, make inroads in Cuba ahead of
them. Companies from Canada, Spain, Mexico and Israel have already
grabbed stakes in Cuban hotels, mines and citrus farms.
	   ``This is a market that is at our doorstep. It's one we should
be supplying,'' said Nelson Denlinger, vice president of U.S. Wheat
Associates, a marketing organization for wheat producers.
	   Sanctions have enhanced Cuba's allure. Washington-based
consultant Kirby Jones calls the island ``untapped, virgin
territory'' for American businesses.
	   Under the Trading With The Enemy Act, U.S. citizens are
forbidden to import Cuban goods or spend money in Cuba.
	   However, the 1963 law does not bar Americans from scouting out
potential opportunities. The U.S. Cuba Trade and Economic Council,
a business group, estimates that 2,000 U.S. executives visited Cuba
last year, up from 500 in 1994.
	   Advocates of normalizing economic ties argue that Cuba is not
much riskier a place to do business than most non-communist
developing countries.
	   Experience in Vietnam suggests otherwise.
	   American companies piled into Vietnam after President Bill
Clinton lifted a 19-year embargo against that former U.S. enemy in
1994.
	   Since then, many have lost their zeal:
	   _ Chrysler Corp. withdrew after deciding the Vietnamese had
licensed too many competitors.
	   _ Procter and Gamble clashed with its local partner and
threatened to close their joint-venture factory.
	   _ Vietnam and the United States still are far apart in
negotiating agreements on trade and civil aviation. Tariffs on
imports from Vietnam remain high as a result, and trade has been
slow to take off.
	   Vietnamese authorities themselves acknowledge that local
officials have obstructed and harassed foreign investors.
Corruption has added to foreigners' costs, and some analysts say
few investors are making money.
	   ``There is a tendency in China and Vietnam to try to wring as
much out of these companies in the first 12 or 24 or 36 months as
possible,'' said Mark Sidel, a former consultant in both countries
for the Ford Foundation.
	   Compounding the business risk in communist nations are curbs on
property ownership and the lack of a Western-style legal code.
Loose accounting standards mean local firms keep as many as four
different sets of records, said Francis Bassolino, a financial
consultant in China for Deloitte and Touche LLP.
	   ``Some of the equivalent problems may not become fully apparent
in Cuba until the embargo comes off,'' Sidel said.
	   John Kavulich of the U.S. Cuba Trade and Economic Council argues
that many of the non-American companies investing in Cuba are on
track toward profitability, especially those in tourism-related
businesses. But he acknowledged that most investors find the Cuban
bureaucracy ``immensely stressful'' and are having problems
operating there.
	   Despite growing pressure on Washington to end its embargo, full
economic and diplomatic ties do not appear imminent.
	   Unlike the case of Vietnam, Congress _ not the president _ must
authorize an end to sanctions on Cuba. Many lawmakers, and
Americans of Cuban descent, are staunchly opposed to Cuban
President Fidel Castro.
	   Havana has reason to go slow as well, Kavulich said.
	   ``Any immediate and substantive change,'' he said, ``would very
well be perceived as an effort to destabilize the Cuban
government.''

Letter outlines US-UK deal for Libyan suspects
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.S.-British agreement to try two
Libyan suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing stipulates that the
suspects cannot be extradited from The Netherlands and that if
found guilty, they would serve their term in the United Kingdom.
	   The deal is outlined in a letter from the U.S. and British
governments to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, requesting he relay
details of the proposal to Libya and help the government transfer
the two to the court.
	   U.S. and British officials announced the agreement Monday in a
bid to end a 10-year impasse over the bombing, which killed 259
people aboard Pan Am Flight 103 and 11 people on the ground at
Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   Libya has refused to turn two suspects over, fearing they
couldn't get a fair trial in the United States or Scotland. The
proposal calls for a Scottish court, involving Scottish judges and
lawyers, to sit in The Netherlands.
	   According to the deal, the only change to normal Scots law is
that the jury will be replaced by a panel of three Scottish High
Court judges.
	   The suspects will have safe passage from Libya to the
Netherlands _ and back to Libya if they are acquitted or if the
trial is discontinued, the letter says.
	   ``While they are in the Netherlands for the purpose of the
trial, we shall not seek their transfer to any jurisdiction other
than the Scottish court sitting in the Netherlands,'' the letter
read.
	   If found guilty, they will serve their sentence in the United
Kingdom, the letter said.
	   Both the United States and Britain are prepared to support a
Security Council resolution on the initiative, which would also
suspend U.N. sanctions upon the appearance of the two accused in
the court, the agreement says.
	   Sanctions, now six years old, include an air embargo and curbs
on arms sales and on certain financial and travel activities.
	   Libya has not commented on the initiative.
	   ``We trust that Libya will respond promptly, positively and
unequivocally by ensuring the timely appearance of the two
accused,'' the letter said.
	   ``If it does not do so, our two governments reserve the right to
propose further sanctions at the time of the next Security Council
review. They also reserve the right to withdraw this initiative.''
	   The deal holds only if Libya produces the suspects in a timely
manner, produces evidence _ including witnesses _ to appear before
the court, and complies with Security Council resolutions.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan was ``extremely pleased,'' about
the proposal and ``hopes that all sides will cooperate in order to
reach an early resolution to this longstanding issue,'' spokesman
Fred Eckhard said Monday.
	   The proposal says the initiative is an approach which has been
endorsed by the Organization of African Unity, the League of Arab
States, the Non-Aligned Movement and the Islamic Conference.
	   The United Kingdom has already prepared legislation to enable
the Scottish court to hold a trial in the Netherlands, the letter
said.

Stocks? No thank you, says U.S. top economist
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE SKIDMORE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ So where does U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan, who knows more about the economy than almost
anybody, put his own money? He shuns the stock market for the
safest investment of all _ short-term Treasury bills.
	   Greenspan's desire to avoid any conflict of interest guides that
decision, says Fed spokeswoman Lynn Fox. But investment advisers
caution that others shouldn't necessarily follow his lead, even
with the market's recent rocky course.
	   ``If you don't have a growth element in your portfolio, you're
not keeping up with inflation,'' said David B. Yeske, a certified
financial planner in San Francisco. ``So he's probably losing
ground with each passing year.''
	   Not that the central bank chairman has much to worry about in
that department, according to Greenspan's financial statement.
	   The man with his finger on the economy's pulse owned at least
dlrs 2.4 million in short-term Treasury securities and had at least
dlrs 466,000 in conservative money market and credit union accounts
at the end of 1997, according to the statement dated June 29.
	   He also owned a Norfolk Southern Corp. bond worth at least dlrs
500,000 and a Massachusetts state bond worth at least dlrs 100,000.
	   That's on top of his annual salary of dlrs 136,700, not to
mention the salary and assets of his wife, NBC-TV correspondent
Andrea Mitchell, 51, whom he married in April 1997. Unlike
Greenspan's holdings, his wife's portfolio is weighted heavily
toward stocks.
	   Greenspan has filed an annual financial disclosure every year
since he was sworn in as Federal Reserve chairman in August 1987.
But until this year it said simply that most of his assets were in
a blind trust worth more than dlrs 1 million. He chose to liquidate
the trust after his marriage to Mitchell so the couple could make
joint financial plans, Fox said.
	   It was probably an expensive decision.
	   ``He probably gave up a couple hundred thousand dollars a year
in investment income,'' Yeske guessed.
	   Many people of Greenspan's age tend to shun stocks in favor of
investments such as Treasury securities, which protect against loss
of principal, said Scott M. Kahan, president of Financial Asset
Management Corp. in New York City.
	   But that can be a mistake. If Greenspan were his client, Kahan
said, he'd warn the chairman he can't count on inflation remaining
as low as it is now. Prices have risen at a 1.5 percent annual rate
so far this year.
	   ``A 72-year-old man in good health could live another 20 years,
or even 25,'' Kahan said.

Government gun controls stop short of ban or buyback scheme
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ The government Tuesday announced
new nationwide gun control measures for New Zealand, but stopped
short of banning military-style semiautomatic weapons despite
widespread public support for such action.
	   Under planned changes to the country's gun laws, military-style
semiautomatic guns remain legal in New Zealand, where an estimated
15,000 of the weapons are thought to be in circulation.
	   The long-awaited reforms follow a review of national gun laws
which was prompted by a series of shootings involving New
Zealanders and growing community concern about gun ownership,
particularly of semiautomatic weapons.
	   In 1990, mass murderer David Gray used military-style weapons to
kill 13 people at Aramoana.
	   In two separate incidents in 1995, New Zealand police shot two
men who were mentally ill but were licensed to own or had access to
guns.
	   In 1996, New Zealand winemaker Jason Winter was one of 35 people
killed by gunman Martin Bryant in Tasmania, Australia, using
military-style weapons.
	   That shooting prompted a nationwide ban in Australia of
military-style semiautomatic guns backed by a government-funded
compensation program to buy newly illegal weapons from gun owners.
	   Author of the government-ordered review in New Zealand, retired
judge Thomas Thorp, recommended similar bans and a buyback scheme.
	   But New Zealand Police Minister Jack Elder on Tuesday said the
government had deferred a decision on banning semiautomatics and a
buyback scheme.
	   A public opinion poll this year found 75 percent of New
Zealanders wanted semiautomatic weapons banned.
	   Under the new laws, owners will have to register individually
each weapon they own, so police can keep better track of people who
amass big collections.
	   Police will also monitor mentally unstable or high risk gun
owners.
	   There will be a six-month registration amnesty for the country's
estimated 93,000 unlicensed gun owners, hefty rises in relicensing
fees and new fines for firearms offenses.
	   Police estimate there are at least 700,000 firearms among New
Zealand's about 3.4 million population.
	   The measures were attacked immediately by gun control lobbyists
as too soft.
	   Gun researcher Philip Alpers said the government had done the
``bare minimum,'' and was taking the cheapest possible action.
	   ``It will still be much easier to own an arsenal of
semiautomatic weapons here than it is in Australia, Canada or
Britain,'' Alpers said.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.S.-British agreement to try two
Libyan suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing stipulates that the
suspects cannot be extradited from The Netherlands and that if
found guilty, they would serve their term in the United Kingdom.
	   The deal is outlined in a letter from the U.S. and British
governments to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, requesting he relay
details of the proposal to Libya and help the government transfer
the two to the court.
	   U.S. and British officials announced the agreement Monday in a
bid to end a 10-year impasse over the bombing, which killed 259
people aboard Pan Am Flight 103 and 11 people on the ground at
Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   Libya has refused to turn two suspects over, fearing they
couldn't get a fair trial in the United States or Scotland. The
proposal calls for a Scottish court, involving Scottish judges and
lawyers, to sit in The Netherlands.
	   According to the deal, the only change to normal Scots law is
that the jury will be replaced by a panel of three Scottish High
Court judges.
	   The suspects will have safe passage from Libya to the
Netherlands _ and back to Libya if they are acquitted or if the
trial is discontinued, the letter says.
	   ``While they are in the Netherlands for the purpose of the
trial, we shall not seek their transfer to any jurisdiction other
than the Scottish court sitting in the Netherlands,'' the letter
read.
	   If found guilty, they will serve their sentence in the United
Kingdom, the letter said.
	   Both the United States and Britain are prepared to support a
Security Council resolution on the initiative, which would also
suspend U.N. sanctions upon the appearance of the two accused in
the court, the agreement says.
	   Sanctions, now six years old, include an air embargo and curbs
on arms sales and on certain financial and travel activities.
	   Libya has not commented on the initiative.
	   ``We trust that Libya will respond promptly, positively and
unequivocally by ensuring the timely appearance of the two
accused,'' the letter said.
	   ``If it does not do so, our two governments reserve the right to
propose further sanctions at the time of the next Security Council
review. They also reserve the right to withdraw this initiative.''
	   The deal holds only if Libya produces the suspects in a timely
manner, produces evidence _ including witnesses _ to appear before
the court, and complies with Security Council resolutions.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan was ``extremely pleased,'' about
the proposal and ``hopes that all sides will cooperate in order to
reach an early resolution to this longstanding issue,'' spokesman
Fred Eckhard said Monday.
	   The proposal says the initiative is an approach which has been
endorsed by the Organization of African Unity, the League of Arab
States, the Non-Aligned Movement and the Islamic Conference.
	   The United Kingdom has already prepared legislation to enable
the Scottish court to hold a trial in the Netherlands, the letter
said.

	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ Russian sensation Anna Kournikova
defeated Barbara Schett of Austria 6-3, 6-2 Monday night in the
first round of the Pilot Pen International.
	   Kournikova, ranked No. 14 in the world, broke Schett in six of
her eight service games. The 17-year old also showed some
versatility, winning with strong cross-court forehands, deft drop
shots and a serve that hit 109 mph (174 kmph).
	   Kournikova, who isn't seeded, will face seventh-seeded Amanda
Coetzer of South Africa in the second round.
	   Coetzer lost a 3-0 lead after two quick breaks in the first set
against Magui Serna of Spain, but held on to win 7-6 (8-6), 6-3.
	   Coetzer hit a series of backhand winners, but also was helped by
Serna's mistakes.
	   ``I think she really gave me a couple,'' said Coetzer, who won
the tiebreaker after falling behind 4-1.
	   Serna beat Steffi Graf in the third round of the du Maurier
tournament last week in Montreal.
	   Coetzer leads the series against Kournikova 3-2. The two last
met in 1997 in Filderstadt, Germany, where Coetzer won in three
sets and reached that tournament's semifinals.
	   ``We know each other's games pretty well. I think my game
matches well against her's,'' Coetzer said. ``She's a good
competitor and she's tough to play.''
	   Also Monday, Mary Joe Fernandez won 11 straight games en route
to a 3-6, 6-0, 6-1 victory over eighth-seeded Dominique Van Roost
of Belgium.
	   Fernandez rallied after the first set with solid play, throwing
Van Roost off her game with deep groundstrokes.
	   ``It was a match where I knew I had to hang in there and fight
hard,'' said Fernandez, who has been recovering after having wrist
surgery in December.
	   Van Roost, ranked No. 13 in the world, said she couldn't do
anything once Fernandez started rolling.
	   ``What can you do when you play somebody like that who doesn't
give you a chance to play your game?'' Van Roost said.
	   The field includes Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna, Lindsay
Davenport, the No. 2 player in the world, and No. 4-ranked Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario.

Rusedski advances in Hamlet Cup

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with night matches &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COMMACK, New York (AP) _ Britain's Greg Rusedski, playing his
second event since spraining his left ankle at Wimbledon, beat
Sweden's Magnus Norman 6-3, 6-4 on Monday night in the first round
of the Hamlet Cup.
	   ``There was a big improvement,'' said Rusedski, coming off a
quarterfinal appearance last week in the RCA Championships in
Indianapolis. ``My volley is better and I have changed my foot work
a little. The ankle is fine.''
	   Rusedski, the U.S. Open runner-up last year, advanced to a
second-round match against Brazil's Fernando Meligeni, a 6-7 (2-7),
6-4, 6-3 winner over France's Guillaume Raoux.
	   ``I need as many matches as possible,'' said the Canadian-born
Rusedski, who had a tour-record 143 mph (229 kmph) serve last year
in the U. S. Open.
	   Defending champion Carlos Moya of Spain and countryman Francisco
Clavet also advanced in the U.S. Open warmup event. Moya beat New
Zealand's Brett Steven 7-5, 6-3, and Clavet defeated Israel's Lior
Mor 6-2, 6-1.
	   Australia's Patrick Rafter, preparing for his U.S. Open title
defense, begins play Tuesday against Spain's Javier Sanchez.
	   Fourth-ranked Petr Korda of the Czech Republic and two-time
winner Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia withdrew because of injuries.
Korda has a neck injury, while Kafelnikov's injury was not
immediately known.
	   Meligeni overcame a slow start against Raoux.
	   ``I played poorly in the first set and was surprised that I got
it to a tiebreaker,'' Meligeni said. ``Once we got into the second
set, I played better and harder. I stayed calm, really concentrated
and felt he was going to give me an opening.''
	   Raoux will get some needed rest before the U.S. Open.
	   ``I lost my concentration,'' Raoux said. ``This is my seventh
tournament in the last eight weeks. I tried to win, but I'm very
tired. It's tough to stay aggressive over such a long span.''
	   In other first-round matches, Germany's David Prinosil beat
Slovakia's Dominik Hrbaty 0-6, 6-4, 6-1, and the Netherlands' Jan
Siemerink defeated Spain's Julian Alonso 4-6, 6-1, 6-4.

Committee fails to agree on Security Council reform
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Special interests and regional rivalries
have again thwarted an attempt to increase representation on the
15-member Security Council, yet another reform proposal that has
been pushed off to next year because states couldn't reach
agreement.
	   The General Assembly on Monday decided that the U.N. working
group trying to expand the Security Council must continue its work
next year because it couldn't to come to any decisions this year.
	   ``Sometimes it seems that the working group has turned into a
body which is aiming rather at preventing Security Council reform
than at making it happen,'' Germany's deputy ambassador, Gerhard W.
Henze told the assembly Monday.
	   Germany and Japan have been pushing to join the five permanent
members of the council, which currently include the United States,
Britain, France, Russia and China.
	   Italy strongly opposes adding permanent members and instead
wants to increase the number of nonpermanent seats. Some
delegations have suggested increasing the nonpermanent seats to 25.
	   The assembly president, Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine said
stumbling blocks had prevented the group from agreeing on anything
related to reform of the council, effectively the U.N. board of
directors.
	   ``This is probably one of the most difficult issues the United
Nations has tackled throughout its history,'' Udovenko said.
	   Glitches include opposition to new permanent seats, disagreement
on how big the council should eventually be and different
approaches to the issue of rotating permanent seats, he said. There
was considerable difference on the problem of veto rights for
current and prospective permanent members.
	   ``International public opinion could be left with an impression
that one group is striving to transform its apparent international
prestige into sound result within the United Nations system,''
Udovenko said.
	   Germany had even stronger words, criticizing the working group
for failing even to give the vaguest roadmap for its work in the
future.
	   ``A working group where a minority does not even agree to a
modest encouragement to make progress in its work after more than
five years ... is about to lose its reason for being,'' Henze said.
	   ``It confirms all the negative outside perceptions the UN are
suffering from with the well known damaging effects,'' he said.
	   The setback comes on the heels of another failed proposal
involving time limits for new U.N. projects. Last month, the
General Assembly failed to approve a key reform measure on ``sunset
provisions,'' which would prevent new U.N. programs from continuing
indefinitely after their effectiveness ends.
	   The assembly referred the matter to the next council session,
which begins Sept. 9.

Pakistan lodges complaint with UN over US missile
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Pakistan formally complained to the
Security Council that the United States violated its airspace when
it launched cruise missile strikes on suspected terrorist camps in
neighboring Afghanistan.
	   A missile landed at Shatinger, in the province of Balochistan,
280 kilometers from the coast in Pansi, Pakistan's U.N. ambassador,
Ahmad Kamal, said Monday in a letter to the Security Council.
	   The government earlier retracted a report that one of the
missiles landed accidentally in Pakistan and killed several people.
	   Pakistan was lodging a formal complaint that its airspace was
violated because ``Such action, if condoned, sets a precedent which
can encourage other countries to pursue aggressive designs against
their neighbors on flimsy or unsubstantiated pretexts,'' Kamal
wrote.
	   The United States on Thursday launched a cruise missile attack
on the Afghan camps, and a simultaneous strike on a Khartoum
pharmaceutical plant, in retaliation for the Aug. 7 bombings of
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Washington claims both were
linked to Osama bin Laden, whom U.S. officials suspect in the
embassy blasts.
	   Sudan has also lodged a complaint with the United Nations,
requesting that the council authorize a technical team to
investigate U.S. claims that the Khartoum factory produced
ingredients used in making the deadly nerve agent VX.
	   Kamal said Pakistan had expected to be informed on the results
of the inquiry into the embassy bombings because it had already
cooperated in the probe by turning over suspect Mohammed Saddiq
Odeh to Kenyan authorities.
	   ``However, the United States, despite being well aware of our
strong position against terrorism, decided to take unilateral
action,'' he said.
	   The elimination of terrorism is of common concern to us all,
Kamal wrote.
	   ``Whereas Pakistan cannot speak for the Afghan government, it
has nevertheless noted that the leadership in Kabul and Kandahar
has again reiterated categorically that they would not allow their
territory to be used for acts of terrorism against third
countries.''

Council discussions expected on Sudan's request for technical team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with U.S. defending action, citing
17 acts of terrorism linked to targets inside closed council &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.S. deputy ambassador said it wasn't
necessary to send a technical team to investigate U.S. claims that
the Sudanese factory it bombed produced chemical agents for
terrorist groups because Washington already has evidence.
	   ``Putting together a technical team to confirm something that we
already know, based on our own information, doesn't seem to have
any point to us,'' Peter Burleigh said Monday in response to a
request for a U.N. investigation from Sudan and backed by Arab
states.
	   The Security Council held preliminary discussions Monday but
took no action. Council president Danilo Turk said future
discussions were possible after members ``reflect on this matter.''
	   ``I understand that one of the needs that was very much on the
minds of the members was to get additional information,'' he said.
``And that would be part of this process.''
	   The United States launched a cruise missile attack Thursday on
the Khartoum plant, and a simultaneous strike against extremist
camps in Afghanistan, in retaliation for the Aug. 7 bombings of
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Washington says the El Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co. plant
and the Afghanistan camps were linked to Osama bin Laden, whom U.S.
officials suspect in the embassy blasts.
	   Sudan says the pharmaceutical plant produced half of the
country's medicines and vaccines, including antibiotics and drugs
for diseases like malaria and tuberculosis. Washington says the
plant also produced an ingredient for the deadly nerve gas VX.
	   China's deputy ambassador, Shen Guofang, said his government
wanted evidence that the plant was indeed used for developing
chemical agents.
	   ``We hope that the United States will give some strong evidence
to prove that this factory produced some poison gas for
terrorism,'' he said.
	   Burleigh said the United States would consider providing
governments with evidence.
	   When asked if an independent U.N. investigation wouldn't
strengthen the U.S. case, Burleigh said: ``There's no doubt about
the credibility of the evidence that the U.S. government has.''
	   Burleigh defended the air strikes to the council, saying U.S.
intelligence indicated the targets in Afghanistan and Sudan were
linked to 17 acts of terrorism, including the attack last year on
tourists in Luxor, Egypt, the assassination attempt on Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and a plot to kill the pope, a diplomat who
attended the closed meeting said.
	   Sudan requested the technical investigation and an urgent
council meeting in a letter to Turk on Friday.
	   It asked the council to ``take its responsibility under the
Charter of the United Nations by condemning this barbarous and
iniquitous aggression and holding the United States of America
responsible for all the material damage and human casualties of
this aggression.''
	   It called the U.S. strikes a ``clear and blatant violation of
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a member state.''

Dollar lower on intervention fears, Tokyo stocks rebound
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday stock, bond and currency; ADDS comments by
finance minister in 4th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen early Tuesday
on continuing fears of yen-intervention by Japanese monetary
authorities. Tokyo stocks rebounded back above the
psychologically-important 15,000-point level.
	   The dollar bought 143.88 yen as of midday, down 0.52 yen from
late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate of
143.95 yen overnight.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
jumped 206.69 points, or 1.38 percent, to 15,195.05 at the end of
morning trading. On Monday, the Nikkei average lost 309.84 points,
or 2.03 percent.
	   The yen gained after overseas investors dumped dollars for the
Japanese currency following comments by Japanese officials such as
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, who warned Tuesday morning that
Japan would intervene to prop up the yen.
	   ``We won't hesitate to intervene if moves are such that they
disrupt the workings of the market economy,'' Miyazawa told a
regular press conference.
	   ``The market's caution against intervention is extremely
strong,'' said Yoneo Sakai, general manager of the international
treasury division at Fuji Bank Ltd. in Tokyo.
	   Other traders said U.S. hedge funds were selling dollars for yen
to book profits to offset losses incurred from investment in Russia
and other emerging markets.
	   Still, traders said gains could be capped by concerns about the
fate of a series of banking-reform bills that the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party will put before Parliament Tuesday. Opposition
parties are resisting the use of public money to bail out ailing
banks.
	   ``It looks like the dollar-yen will seesaw around the 143-yen
level for a while,'' said Koichi Kubo, assistant manager of
international foreign exchange at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, prices rebounded following Monday's
steep decline, when the Nikkei 225 average closed below 15,000 for
the first time in a week.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 8.64 points, or 0.75 percent, to 1,166.94 at
midday. The TOPIX closed down 18.21 points, or 1.55 percent, the
day before.
	   Prices gained following the overnight rise on Wall Street, where
the Dow Jones industrial average rose 32.96 points _ or 0.4 percent
_ to 8,566.61.
	   Traders said they were heartened by the Dow's resilience despite
the ambiguity that still clouds Russia's future.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond was unchanged from Wednesday's finish of 1.135 percent. Its
price also remained steady at Monday's 112.19 yen.

<TEXT>
	   COMMACK, New York (AP) _ Britain's Greg Rusedski, playing his
second event since spraining his left ankle at Wimbledon, beat
Sweden's Magnus Norman 6-3, 6-4 on Monday night in the first round
of the Hamlet Cup.
	   ``There was a big improvement,'' said Rusedski, coming off a
quarterfinal appearance last week in the RCA Championships in
Indianapolis. ``My volley is better and I have changed my foot work
a little. The ankle is fine.''
	   Rusedski, the U.S. Open runner-up last year, advanced to a
second-round match against Brazil's Fernando Meligeni, a 6-7 (2-7),
6-4, 6-3 winner over France's Guillaume Raoux.
	   ``I need as many matches as possible,'' said the Canadian-born
Rusedski, who had a tour-record 143 mph (229 kmph) serve last year
in the U. S. Open.
	   Defending champion Carlos Moya of Spain and countryman Francisco
Clavet also advanced in the U.S. Open warmup event. Moya beat New
Zealand's Brett Steven 7-5, 6-3, and Clavet defeated Israel's Lior
Mor 6-2, 6-1.
	   Australia's Patrick Rafter, preparing for his U.S. Open title
defense, begins play Tuesday against Spain's Javier Sanchez.
	   Fourth-ranked Petr Korda of the Czech Republic and two-time
winner Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia withdrew because of injuries.
Korda has a neck injury, while Kafelnikov's injury was not
immediately known.
	   Meligeni overcame a slow start against Raoux.
	   ``I played poorly in the first set and was surprised that I got
it to a tiebreaker,'' Meligeni said. ``Once we got into the second
set, I played better and harder. I stayed calm, really concentrated
and felt he was going to give me an opening.''
	   Raoux will get some needed rest before the U.S. Open.
	   ``I lost my concentration,'' Raoux said. ``This is my seventh
tournament in the last eight weeks. I tried to win, but I'm very
tired. It's tough to stay aggressive over such a long span.''
	   In other first-round matches, Russia's Marat Safin beat Spain's
Alberto Berasategui 6-3, 6-2, Germany's David Prinosil defeated
Slovakia's Dominik Hrbaty 0-6, 6-4, 6-1, and the Netherlands' Jan
Siemerink beat Spain's Julian Alonso 4-6, 6-1, 6-4.

<TEXT>
	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) _ Russian sensation Anna Kournikova
defeated Barbara Schett of Austria 6-3, 6-2 Monday night in the
first round of the Pilot Pen International.
	   Kournikova, ranked No. 14 in the world, broke Schett in six of
her eight service games. The 17-year old also showed some
versatility, winning with strong cross-court forehands, deft drop
shots and a serve that hit 109 mph (174 kmph).
	   ``I think I was attacking very well and not making too many
mistakes,'' said Kournikova, although she was broken three times.
	   Kournikova, who isn't seeded, will face seventh-seeded Amanda
Coetzer of South Africa in the second round.
	   Coetzer lost a 3-0 lead after two quick breaks in the first set
against Magui Serna of Spain, but held on to win 7-6 (8-6), 6-3.
	   Coetzer hit a series of backhand winners, but also was helped by
Serna's mistakes.
	   ``I think she really gave me a couple,'' said Coetzer, who won
the tiebreaker after falling behind 4-1.
	   Serna beat Steffi Graf in the third round of the du Maurier
tournament last week in Montreal.
	   Coetzer leads the series against Kournikova 3-2. The two last
met in 1997 in Filderstadt, Germany, where Coetzer won in three
sets and reached that tournament's semifinals.
	   ``We know each other's games pretty well. I think my game
matches well against her's,'' Coetzer said. ``She's a good
competitor and she's tough to play.''
	   Also Monday, Mary Joe Fernandez won 11 straight games en route
to a 3-6, 6-0, 6-1 victory over eighth-seeded Dominique Van Roost
of Belgium.
	   Fernandez rallied after the first set with solid play, throwing
Van Roost off her game with deep groundstrokes.
	   ``It was a match where I knew I had to hang in there and fight
hard,'' said Fernandez, who has been recovering after having wrist
surgery in December.
	   Van Roost, ranked No. 13 in the world, said she couldn't do
anything once Fernandez started rolling.
	   ``What can you do when you play somebody like that who doesn't
give you a chance to play your game?'' Van Roost said.
	   The field includes Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna, Lindsay
Davenport, the No. 2 player in the world, and No. 4-ranked Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario.

	   _ Alex Corretja captured the RCA Championships in Indianapolis
with a 2-6, 6-2, 6-3 victory over Andre Agassi.
	   _ Karol Kucera downed Goran Ivanisevic 6-4, 5-7, 6-2 in the
final of the Pilot Pen International in New Haven, Conn.
	   _ Monica Seles won her first title in almost a year by defeating
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the final of the du Maurier Open in
Montreal, 6-3, 6-2.
	   _ Jiri Vanek won the dlrs 50,000 Grolsch Cup by defeating Andrei
Cherkasov 7-6 (7-4) 7-5 in Warsaw, Poland.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SPEAKING &QC; 
	   ``I hit a lot of double faults. The second serve was bad. I had
no forehand down the line. I hit bad returns, the backhand was too
risky. I was running like an idiot.'' _ Goran Ivanisevic, after
losing the Pilot Pen International final to Karol Kucera.
	   ``It's always a scary moment. He was close to the net and just
happened to be where I hit the ball.'' _ Andre Agassi, after
hitting a ball that struck Alex Corretja on the left chest,
knocking the Spaniard down.
	   ``When I got up, I didn't know where I was. I didn't know if I
was in Indianapolis or Barcelona (his hometown) or wherever.'' _
Alex Corretja.
	   ``It's like I'm still dreaming. When I was a small girl, I
always thought that Steffi was the greatest.'' _ Magui Serna of
Spain after upsetting Steffi Graf 6-4, 6-4 at the du Maurier Open.
	   ``I'm not feeling the ball. I just don't seem to see the ball
well at night. I think I played pretty bad.'' _ Marcelo Rios, after
losing to Byron Black in third round of the RCA Championships.
	   ``Sampras owes me one.'' Byron Black, after his upset over
Marcelo Rios at the RCA Championships meant Pete Sampras would
regain his No. 1 ranking.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SCARY MOMENT &QC; 
	   Alex Corretja survived a knockdown to beat Andre Agassi in the
title match of the RCA Championships. With Agassi at the net,
Corretja hit a lob to the baseline and went to the net himself.
Agassi raced back, turned and, in the same motion, fired a forehand
down the middle of the court. The ball struck Corretja in his left
chest and the Spaniard dropped to his back on the court. Agassi
immediately jumped over the net to check on his opponent, who rose
up after a moment and resumed the match.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SECURING A SPOT &QC; 
	   Marcelo Rios of Chile is the first player to qualify for the
year-ending ATP Tour World Championships, which will be held in
Hanover, Germany, Nov. 24-29. The top eight players in the rankings
on Nov. 23 will qualify, and Rios already has enough points to
guarantee him a spot. The last South American to qualify for the
World Championships was Andres Gomez of Ecuador in 1990.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SEASON-ENDERS &QC; 
	   Defending champion Jana Novotna and Lindsey Davenport joined
top-ranked Martina Hingis as the first three qualifiers for the
season-ending Chase Championships of the Corel WTA Tour. Novotna,
who beat Mary Pierce in the final of last year's Chase
Championships, captured her first grand slam singles title in July
when she won Wimbledon. The tournament will be held Nov. 15-22 at
New York's Madison Square Garden.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SAME FACES &QC; 
	   When Monica Seles won the du Maurier Open in Montreal, defeating
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the final, it shouldn't have come as a
surprise. Seles became the first player to win the Canadian
tournament four straight times, and it was the third time Seles and
Sanchez Vicario had met in the du Maurier title match, the Spaniard
winning in 1992 and Seles capturing their 1996 meeting.
	   It's the first time Seles has won the same singles title four
straight years. She won four consecutive Australian Open titles,
but not in consecutive years. She also becomes just the eighth
woman in the Open Era to win a tour title four years in succession,
joining Steffi Graf, Martina Navratilova, Chris Evert, Tracy
Austin, Evonne Goolagong, Pam Shriver and Conchita Martinez.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; STILL SEEKING &QC; 
	   Goran Ivanisevic is still seeking his first American tournament
title. He lost his fifth final on American soil when he was beaten
by Karol Kucera in the title match of the Pilot Pen International
in New Haven, Conn. The Croatian left-hander also is still trying
to claim his first grand slam tournament crown after finishing
runner-up in July for the third time at Wimbledon.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SKOFF SUIT &QC; 
	   Austria's Horst Skoff is suing the ATP Tour for dlrs 10 million
over a lifetime ban imposed on Skoff for his alleged refusal to
take a drug test at a Belgian tournament in July 1997. Skoff has
won two minor court cases against the ATP Tour already. In January,
a Broward County, Fla., judge granted an injunction overturning the
ban, saying Skoff did submit to testing and finding the men's
organization committed more than 20 violations of its own rules and
procedures. More recently, the Miami Herald reported that the
Belgium government revoked the tour's permission to perform testing
in Belgium after questions arose concerning the medical
qualifications of David Martin, who conducted the testing. Stay
tuned.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SELF-SWAT &QC; 
	   Peter Brightman of Hertfordshire retired from his second-round
match in the British National Junior Championships when he struck
himself on the head with his racket on his follow-through of a
shot. He had won the first set, but retired two games after he hit
himself when it became obvious he was suffering from concussion.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SWITCHING SPORTS &QC; 
	   Dutchman Richard Krajicek threw out the first pitch at the New
Haven Ravens Class AA baseball game during the Pilot Pen
International tournament. Krajicek, who has one of the biggest
serves in tennis, threw a moon ball right over home plate.

Three-part Lord of the Rings classic to be filmed in New Zealand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ The volcanic mountains and
glaciers of New Zealand will be used to portray the Middle Earth of
J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy classic Lord of the Rings in a trilogy of
films announced Tuesday by local director Peter Jackson.
	   Jackson said shooting will begin next year on the first of a
three-film, U.S. dlrs 130 million (New Zealand dollars 264 million)
project for New Line Cinema.
	   ``I'm a huge admirer of the books and think it could make a
great sequence of movies,'' Jackson said. ``Somewhere over the next
two years I've got to find those great movies and shoot them.''
	   Jackson, whose previous films include the Oscar-nominated
``Heavenly Creatures'' and ``The Frighteners,'' made in New Zealand
with Hollywood money, said principal photography would take about a
year, with 18 months set aside for postproduction.
	   The first film, ``The Fellowship Of The Ring'', is due for
release around Christmas 2000. The sequels, ``The Two Towers'' and
``The Return Of The King,'' six and 12 months afterwards.
	   Staff at Weta Digital, Jackson's special effects firm, have
already been working for a year on developing new computer
technology needed to bring Tolkein's fantasy world to life.
	   Published in 1954-55, The Lord of the Rings is an epic saga of a
battle between good and evil, set in the mythic world of Middle
Earth. Halflings, elves, wizards, dwarves and men battle to
preserve the land from the dark lord Sauron and his armies of orcs,
goblins and wolves.
	   The landscape of New Zealand _ which translates in some Maori
languages as ``The Land of the Long White Cloud'' _ will be crucial
to creating a believable Middle Earth, Jackson said.
	   ``New Zealand is the best country in the world to shoot this
film. Landscapes are very important in the story, and New Zealand
has all those landscapes.
	   ``(I want the film to) look like we went out to Middle Earth and
shot on location.''
	   The films will be co-written and co-produced with Jackson's
partner Fran Walsh, under his Wingnut Films banner. Executive
producer would be Saul Zaentz, whose films include ``The English
Patient,'' ``Amadeus'' and ``One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.''
	   Jackson said new software has been developed to bring Tolkien's
characters to life.
	   ``It would have been impossible to do Lord of the Rings before
the advent of computers. With computers, we've arrived at a time
when anything you can imagine can be put on to film,'' he said.

 &UR; Eds: Subs second London-dated item to ADD quote; note that Lennon's

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A 53-year-old English woman claims she is John
Lennon's half-sister.
	   Birth and adoption certificates of Ingrid Pedersen, which were
printed in the Sun newspaper Monday, appear to show she was born
Victoria Elizabeth Lennon in Liverpool to the late Julia Lennon,
the mother of the late Beatles star.
	   Lennon's father left his mother when the boy was 3 years old.
Ms. Pedersen was reportedly the result of Julia Lennon's brief
affair with a soldier, and was given up for adoption because her
mother was unable to cope with the baby.
	   Ms. Pedersen, of Chandlers Ford, England, said she felt free to
claim her relationship to Lennon since her adoptive mother died
five weeks ago.
	   ``Now at last I can admit who I am _ the little sis John loved
but could never find,'' The Sun quoted her as saying.
	   ``I kept this secret for the sake of my mum. But now she's dead
I want to find my real family.''
	   Pederson said that in 1966, her mother told her she was adopted
and that she was John Lennon's half sister.
	   Eliot Mintz, a family spokesman, said he faxed the singer's
widow, Yoko Ono, the Sun story but that she had not yet responded
to it.
	   On Tuesday, the Sun quoted Lennon's cousin Stan Parkes as
saying: ``John didn't know of his sister's existence until 1964 and
he did everything in his power to find her.
	   ``He wanted to make her part of the family and look after her,''
the Sun quoted him as saying.
	   Lennon was shot and killed by a deranged fan on the street
outside his New York apartment in 1980.

Prosecutors seek jail term for former elite bureaucrat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prosecutors on Tuesday demanded a three-year prison
term for a former Finance Ministry official at the center of a
lavish entertainment-for-favors scandal that has shaken Japan's
powerful bureaucracy.
	   They also asked for a fine of 3.38 million yen (dlrs 23,000) for
Takashi Sakakibara, 38, a Tokyo District Court official said. He
spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Sakakibara, once a top official in the ministry's Securities
Bureau, was accused of accepting bribes worth 3.45 million yen
(dlrs 24,000).
	   Prosecutors said they came in the form of fancy dinners and golf
outings between March 1993 and July 1997 courtesy of Nomura
Securities Co., Nikko Securities Co., Daiwa Securities., the
now-defunct Yamaichi Securities Co., and Sumitomo Bank Ltd.
	   In return, Sakakibara allegedly helped persuade the ministry to
let the brokerages offer new financial products and tipped off
Sumitomo about revisions in Japan's bank law.
	   Sakakibara, the first elite career-track bureaucrat to be
arrested since the end of World War II, has admitted being
entertained. But he has denied providing any favors in return.
	   In seeking the prison term and fine, prosecutors described as
``grave'' Sakakibara's responsibility for losing people's trust
toward Japan's system of finance and securities administration,
Kyodo News reported.
	   Sakakibara ``lacked awareness and a sense of ethics as a public
official,'' Kyodo quoted prosecutors as telling the court.
	   Sakakibara and another Finance Ministry official were arrested
March 5 in a widespread bribery investigation by prosecutors. The
ministry fired Sakakibara in July.
	   He is no relation to Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's vice finance

U.S. Air Force pilot in excellent condition after F-16 crashes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ An American pilot forced to eject over
the Sea of Japan from his F-16 jet fighter was in excellent
condition Tuesday, the U.S. Air Force said.
	   The Air Force declined to identify the flier or his hometown,
but South Korean police said he was Capt. David Murphy, 3l, from
the 36th Fighter Squadron at Osan air base south of Seoul.
	   The pilot ejected by parachute 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) off the
east coast of Kangnung, 200 kilometers (125 miles) east of Seoul
Monday evening.
	   He was picked up by a South Korean fishing boat and brought to
Kangnung, then transported to his base for a medical evaluation,
the Air Force said.
	   The Air Force was investigating the accident.

German woman found at Thai temple taken to hospital by embassy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A young German woman found living at a
Buddhist temple in Thailand for the last four years has been taken
to a Bangkok hospital for examination, the German Embassy said
Tuesday.
	   Two embassy officials escorted Yvonne Rikkerp to Somdej
Chaophraya Hospital for tests to determine if she is mentally ill,
and if possible, if she was raped.
	   German embassy officials said they hoped to be able to return
Rikkerp to Germany, but it would depend on what doctors said about
her condition.
	   Rikkerp was discovered by Thai television crews last week while
visiting the Wat Tham Krabok temple in Saraburi, 90 kilometers (56
miles) north of Bangkok.
	   The wat, whose worshippers are mainly members of the Hmong
hilltribe, houses a drug rehabilitation center, where Rikkerp was
reportedly left by colleagues for treatment sometime during 1994.
	   Rikkerp has told police that she was repeatedly raped at the
temple. Villagers who live near the temple, but who also bear some
animosity toward the Hmong, have also said she was repeatedly raped
and said she was being kept against her will.
	   The monks who run the temple denied she was either there against
her will or had been raped. They said she appeared mentally
unstable when she arrived.
	   Thai police and government officials have been considering
whether or not to shut the temple down because of allegations that
drug dealing is taking place there.

Sri Lanka's top athlete formally cleared of drug charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ South Asia's fastest woman athlete has
been formally cleared of charges of using a banned
performance-enhancing drug, her lawyer said Tuesday.
	   Susantika Jayasinghe, 23, was summoned Monday by Arya Kannanara,
president of Sri Lanka's top athletics body and told of her
exoneration by the International Amateur Athletics Federation, the
athlete's counsel Daya Parera said.
	   Jayasinghe, who surprised the sports world by finishing ahead of
Merlene Ottey at the World Track Championships in Athens last year
claiming the silver in the 200-meter sprint, can now take part in
the forthcoming Commonwealth Games in Malaysia.
	   ``I have done no wrong and I knew the truth will come out one
day,'' Jayasinghe told The Associated Press. ``I only wish the
decision had come earlier, which would have given me mental peace
that I need for training.''
	   A three-member Sri Lankan panel had cleared her by a 2-1 vote in
July, but a formal acceptance of the report by the IAAF was
mandatory for lifting the ban on her imposed in April.
	   Jayasinghe was banned by the IAAF after samples showed she had
taken the banned steroid, Nandralone-19, during a random off-season
test of athletes training for the Sydney Olympics.
	   Jayasinghe had claimed that she had taken some drug to control
her menstrual cycle, but not Nandralone-19. She had accused Sri
Lankan officials of trying to ruin her career, saying she had
rebuffed their sexual advances.
	   Jayasinghe had tested positive for Nandralone-19 earlier at the
1995 Asian Championship. She was banned from further participation.
Subsequently, the IAAF had lifted that ban following medical
evidence that a drug taken by women to delay the menstrual cycle
has similar organic compounds as Nandralone-19.
	   Jayasinghe is seen by many as Sri Lanka's best medal hope at the
Sydney Olympics.
	   Jayasinghe became only the second Sri Lankan athlete to win a
medal at a top international meet in 49 years when she won the
silver in Athens. Duncan White won a silver in the 400 meter
hurdles at the 1948 Olympics.

Prisoner accused of murdering child during prison visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PACHUCA, Mexico (AP) _ A prisoner held on charges of killing one
child strangled a 3-year-old girl who was visiting her father in
the jail, prosecutors said Monday.
	   Noe Hernandez Chavez, 19, told reporters he killed the little
girl on Sunday ``for pure pleasure.''
	   The girl, Norma Arely Lopez Galicia, was at the prison with five
other relatives to celebrate the birthday of her father, Filberto
Lopez Rodriguez, who is serving a 10 year sentence for homicide.
	   The state attorney general's office said the girl wandered off
after her parents went to the jail commissary, leaving her and her
siblings with an aunt. Six hours later, her body was found beneath
a bed in one of the cells.
	   Interviewed by reporters at the attorney general's office,
Hernandez said he had planned the killing for months and even
offered gruesome details of the crime.
	   Hernandez has been jailed for nine months, charged with raping
and decapitating 6-year-old Marlen Perez Lopez in Pachuca, 60 miles
(95 kilometers) northeast of Mexico City.
	   After the second killing, he was transferred to another jail for
his own security.

<TEXT>
	   WILLIAMSPORT, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Kevin Hodges is such a
perfectionist that when he threw the first perfect game in the
history of the Southern Regionals, he was a little upset.
	   See, he'd gone 0-for-3 at the plate.
	   He didn't seem all that thrilled about his two-hitter Monday
that gave Greenville, North Carolina, a 3-1 victory over Jenison,
Michigan, in the Little League World Series.
	   ``They were hitting my fastball, so I had to throw some
curveballs,'' he said, sounding a little disappointed that his heat
hadn't blown them away and that he had to rely on his curve to get
those nine strikeouts.
	   ``His goal is to fan everybody and hit three grand slams as
well,'' his manager, Wayne Hardee, said.
	   Instead, Justin Hardee provided the offense Monday, going
3-for-3 with two singles, a run scored and a sixth-inning solo
homer that padded Greenville's lead.
	   On Monday night, Toms River, New Jersey, got its second win of
the series, beating Cypress, California, 4-2 after Gabe Gardner hit
a three-run homer with two outs to cap a four-run fifth inning.
	   ``It's really big,'' New Jersey manager Mike Gaynor said. ``I
didn't think we'd be in this situation. Fortunately, the boys came
back.''
	   Also Monday, Mike Erickson hit two home runs and reliever Jeff
Duda didn't give up a hit in three innings as Langley, Canada, beat
Guadalupe, Mexico, 4-3 to hand the defending champion its second
loss of the World Series.
	   And in the fourth game, Kashima, Japan, hit three homers _
including two three-run shots in a seven-run third inning _ to beat
Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, 10-3.
	   Kashima and Toms River are 2-0 in pool play. Guadalupe, 6-1
losers to Kashima on Sunday, is 0-2 in pool play, as is Jenison,
which lost to Toms River, 13-9 Sunday in 11 innings.
	   Langley and Greenville are 1-0. Dhahran and Cypress are 0-1.
	   Derek Stempin was the only batter to get to Hodges, with a
fourth-inning homer. Jenison ace Billy Miller gave up just four
hits and an earned run.
	   It didn't help that Jenison, only half a day earlier, had played
the longest game in World Series history _ nearly two six-inning
games.
	   The players didn't get to bed until 11:30 p.m., and they slept
through breakfast. They didn't get up until around 10:30 a.m., but
they still came out flat.
	   ``We played two hellacious games and just came up short,''
manager Tom Meyer said. ``But give their pitcher credit. He kept us
off guard with a real good curveball, as good as curve as we've
seen.''
	   Toms River starter Todd Frazier held Cypress to three hits, but
it was almost his counterpart's day.
	   Cypress starter Alex Alba didn't allow a hit until there were
two outs in the fifth when Scott Fisher's chopper scored the first
run. Gardner followed with his homer to put Toms River ahead 4-2.
	   ``Going into the fifth inning, we knew we had the top of their
order coming up,'' Cypress manager Greg Novy said. ``We didn't make
the defensive plays to get out of it and they made us pay.''
	   Alba had 10 strikeouts and also hit a two-run homer.
	   In the first game, which was delayed by rain for an hour, Duda
held Guadalupe scoreless over the final three innings while
striking out eight _ including the side in the sixth.
	   Erickson went 2-for-3, and one of his home runs broke a 3-3 tie
in the fifth inning.
	   Jorge Trevino hit a two-run homer for Guadalupe.
	   Guadalupe is trying to repeat the feat of the last Mexican team
to win the World Series, Monterrey, which won titles in 1957 and
1958.
	   ``It'll be a miracle for us to be in'' the finals, Guadalupe
manager Jose Alvarez said.
	   A Canadian team has never won the World Series.
	   For Kashima, Tatsuya Sugata had a three-run homer and four RBIs,
and Masahiro Sugaya added a three-run homer.
	   Sugata, Japan's starter, and relievers Kazuya Hara and Shinya
Ikeda combined on the three-hitter.
	   The top finishers in the U.S and international pool competitions
play Thursday. The winners meet in Saturday's final.

Muster moves on easily
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS and UPDATES with Muster-Filippini match. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BROOKLINE, Massachusetts (AP) _ Thomas Muster, a top 10 player
the last three years before falling to his current No. 24 ranking,
dominated Marcelo Filippini of Uruguay 6-0, 6-3 Monday night in the
first round of the MFS Pro Tennis Championships at Longwood Cricket
Club.
	   The fifth-seeded left-hander from Austria took control in the
55-minute match with top-spin forehands. Muster led 3-0 in the
second set before Filippini was able to salvage a few games.
	   ``They're never easy,'' Muster said, ``but I moved very well
today.''
	   ``He overpowered me and I never had a a chance to play my
game,'' Filippini said.
	   Muster won this event 10 years ago when it was played on clay,
his favorite surface. It's now played on hardcourt.
	   Earlier Monday, Gianluca Pozzi, at 33 the oldest player on the
ATP Tour, upset sixth-seeded Fabrice Santoro of France, 6-2, 6-2.
	   Pozzi, who holds a No. 62 world ranking and boasts a win over
No. 2 Marcelo Rios this summer, used his deep forehands to force
Santoro into numerous errors from the baseline.
	   ``I played a solid match and by keeping the ball deep I was
forcing him to miss in a lot of the baseline rallies,'' Pozzi said.
	   Third-seeded Cedric Pioline was the highest ranked player to
advance. The veteran from Paris needed only 55 minutes to sweep
past Romania's Adrian Voinea, 6-4, 6-0.
	   ``My ground strokes were pretty good today,'' Pioline said. ``I
was especially pleased because I had been concerned about my
consistency lately. I was going to take the week off, then I
decided I needed the work for the (U.S.) Open, so I got a wild card
here.''
	   In other first-round matches, Kenneth Carlsen of Denmark
outlasted Jerome Golmard of France 3-6, 6-3, 6-4; Sebastien
Grosjean of France stopped John van Lottum of the Netherlands 6-2,
6-0; and 18-year-old Xavier Malisse of Belgium beat Steve Campbell
6-3, 6-1.
	   Eighth-seeded Vince Spadea was forced to withdraw Monday morning
because of a sprained right wrist.
	   Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden and Karol Kucera of Slovakia, the top
two seeds, see their first action Tuesday.

Source: British Airways on verge of buying Airbus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In a move certain to rattle the Boeing Co.,
British Airways is about to order its first batch of jets from
Europe's Airbus Industrie, an aviation executive says.
	   British Airways would not comment on what spokesman Iain Burns
called ``speculation,'' but Airbus called a news conference for
early Tuesday afternoon with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and
Airbus President Noel Forgeard at its headquarters in Toulouse,
France.
	   An industry executive, who spoke only on condition of anonymity,
said British Airways plans to buy 59 short-haul jets from Airbus,
including A319, A320 and A321 models while keeping Boeing as its
supplier for larger jets as it orders more Boeing 777s.
	   All told, British Airways will be spending 3 billion pounds
(dlrs 5 billion) to revamp its fleet, but the executive could not
specify how much money will go to Airbus and how much to Boeing.
	   Whatever the amounts, the deal is a commercial victory and a
huge psychological score for Airbus, the consortium made up of
aerospace companies from Britain, France, Spain and Germany.
	   While most European airlines have bought from Airbus, British
Airways has long been one of Boeing's most loyal customers.
	   The big British airline has never purchased any airplanes
directly from Airbus, although it now has 10 in its fleet that came
with the acquisition of a smaller airline several years ago.
	   British Airways announced in February that it would be buying a
new batch of short-haul jets to replace airplanes now flown from
its bases in Manchester, Birmingham and London Gatwick, as well as
for its French and German subsidiaries, Air Liberte and Deutsche
BA.
	   Despite the partial defection to Airbus, British Airways still
plans to fly lots of Boeings.
	   British Airways plans to rearrange its mix of large Boeing jets,
using slightly smaller versions on some long-haul routes, according
to the industry source.
	   British Airways now flies to dozens of cities all over the world
using Boeing 747 jumbo jets, but in the future it will shift more
services to smaller jets such as the Boeing 777, the source said.
