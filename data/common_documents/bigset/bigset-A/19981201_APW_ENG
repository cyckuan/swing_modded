Fear of crime and riots hits Indonesia's depressed retail sector
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Sporadic rioting, rising crime, and
continued student protests have worsened a retail slump in
Indonesia, according to the Indonesian Retailers' Association.
	   The increasingly uncertain situation on Jakarta's streets has
resulted in many people leaving work earlier and reduced the
likelihood of night shopping, once a favorite pastime among
affluent Jakarta residents.
	   ``I think some of the retailers also feel very much that their
volumes will go down,'' association chairman Steve Sondakh told Dow
Jones Newswires in an interview released Tuesday.
	   ``They are naturally going to shorten their operating hours,''
said Sondahk, who is also a direct of the Hero supermarket chain,
one of Indonesia's biggest retail groups.
	   Consumer activity has already been hit by a deep recession
caused by Indonesia's worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Sondakh said retail sales on average have already fallen between
30 percent and 40 percent from a year ago, with the electronics
sector being the hardest hit. Sales there are down an estimated 60
percent.
	   The rise in lawlessness, which has grown out of the unrest on
the streets, is also adding to retailers' woes. Crime has steadily
increased in Jakarta with several foreign embassies advising their
citizens to avoid the city of 11 million altogether.

Witness says he tried to win favor from Anwar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A key police witness in the Anwar
Ibrahim trial told the court Tuesday that he had tried and failed
to win business favors from the former deputy prime minister, but
that was not why he was testifying against him.
	   The former police intelligence officer, Amir Junos, took the
witness stand as the trial stumbled along amid the three-month jail
sentence for a defense lawyer held in contempt of court.
	   The lawyer, Zainur Zakaria, who won a reprieve from a higher
court that stayed his imprisonment pending an appeal hearing
Friday, was present in the court Tuesday.
	   Judge Augustine Paul handed down the sentence Monday after
Zainur refused to apologize for an affidavit he had filed on behalf
of Anwar seeking the removal of two prosecutors on grounds that
they were allegedly fabricating evidence.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, two weeks after he was fired as
deputy prime minister and finance minister. His subsequent jailing
and beating while in custody has attracted international concern
over the case.
	   Anwar is being tried on four counts of corruption. He will be
tried on another corruption count, as well as five counts of sexual
misconduct, at a later date.
	   Anwar denies the charges, calling them part of a political
vendetta orchestrated by his former mentor, Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   Monday's sideshow interrupted the main trial when a stumped
defense team asked for an adjournment to recover from the blow.
	   Resuming Tuesday to defend Anwar against allegations that he
abused his power to cover up alleged sexual misdeeds, lawyer
Christopher Fernando asked Amir whether he held a grudge against
Anwar because his request had been denied.
	   ``I have no intent to come to the court and exaggerate and
embellish my testimony in an effort to embarrass Anwar,'' he said.
	   He had earlier admitted during cross-examination to asking Anwar
for equity in a securities firm and business deals for his friends.
	   Amir was called as a witness by the prosecution to prove
allegations that Anwar had directed the police to harass and
intimidate two people who had alleged that Anwar had sex with his
secretary's wife and had sodomized his chauffeur.

British-American Tobacco Company halts Singapore manufacturing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The British-American Tobacco Company said
Tuesday its Singapore subsidiary will halt all manufacturing
because of a significant drop in local and global demand.
	   The Singapore facility _ which produces tobacco products for
domestic and export markets _ was no longer viable, and its closure
will result in significant cost savings, said a statement from BAT.
	   The plant will cease all manufacturing operations by June 1999,
and more than 300 employees will be laid off.
	   The London-based company says its non-manufacturing activities,
which include the import and sale of tobacco products in Singapore,
will not be affected by the closure.
	   British-American Tobacco Company said the cost of winding the
plant down will likely result in a loss for the financial year
ending Dec. 31, but the company is optimistic about future
prospects for the streamlined business.

49ers 31, Giants 7
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Jerry Rice complained about the San
Francisco 49ers' erratic play, and offered to jump start the
offense. Instead, it was Terrell Owens who provided the spark.
	   Owens caught a 79-yard touchdown pass from Steve Young and
Garrison Hearst ran for 166 yards in 20 carries to go over 1,000
yards rushing for the second straight season as San Francisco beat
the New York Giants 31-7 Monday night for their 15th straight
regular-season home win.
	   But the win was costly. The 49ers lost star defensive tackle
Bryant Young midway through the fourth quarter to a right leg
injury. Replays showed the leg bent backwards as he collided with
linebacker Ken Norton Jr. as they closed in for a tackle. He was
wheeled off the field on a gurney.
	   ``That's a devastating blow to our team,'' said Young. ``Bryant
Young is the man. We're going to have to close ranks and keep
marching ahead.''
	   Said Owens: '' It was kind of somber in the locker room. Every
week we have adversity and we have to overcome it.''
	   The victory clinched a 16th straight winning season for the
49ers (9-3) and kept them a game behind first-place Atlanta in the
NFC West with four remaining.
	   The Giants (4-8) started fast but then faded, much like they
have this season after winning the NFC East last year. Kent Graham
had a 48-yard completion to Ike Hilliard on their first play and
three plays later, Gary Brown bolted 11 yards up the middle for a
touchdown.
	   New York, with the second-worst offensive ranking in the league,
couldn't sustain its advantage against a 49ers team that fell
behind for the seventh time in nine games.
	   Owens, who finished with five catches for 140 yards, turned a
short flat pass from Young into a score to pull into a 7-all tie
with 2:39 left in the first period.
	   The fleet Owens, now perhaps the 49ers' most dangerous receiver,
blew past Conrad Hamilton near the line of scrimmage and pulled
free of Sam Garnes' grasp at the 30. Suddenly, he was running free
down the left sideline and into the end zone.
	   ``I gave'em a little juke here and there to get free,'' Owens
said.

Separatists win re-election in Quebec
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 7 grafs to UPDATE with anti-separatists pulling
ahead in popular vote despite losing race. Picks up 8th graf pvs,
`Charest, 40, ... &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Quebec's pro-independence government was
re-elected but won only 43 percent of the popular vote, likely
dampening its zest for holding a secession referendum soon.
	   The outcome of Monday's election means a new term of up to five
years for Quebec's charismatic premier, Lucien Bouchard, who says
he will call a referendum on independence whenever he feels the
separatist side can win.
	   But he may need to wait a while for what he calls the ``winning
conditions.'' His Parti Quebecois retained its majority in the
legislature but was narrowly outpolled in the popular vote by its
anti-separatist rival, the Quebec Liberal Party.
	   With 94 percent of the 23,000 polling stations reporting late
Monday, the separatists had 42.8 percent of the votes, to 43.6
percent for the Liberals and 12 percent for a third party,
Democratic Action.
	   The separatists were on track to win 77 of the legislature's 125
seats, the Liberals 46 and Democratic Action one, with one seat to
be filled later because the separatist candidate recently died.
	   The outcome was a virtual replay of 1994, when the separatists
won 77 seats to 47 for the Liberals while each receiving about 44
percent of the popular vote.
	   Bouchard's main rival was Liberal party leader Jean Charest, who
tried to persuade voters that the province would prosper only if
the decades-old threat of secession was abandoned.
	   Charest, 40, became an early favorite when he quit federal
politics in March to enter the Quebec race; in English-speaking
Canada he was viewed as the potential savior of national unity.
	   But despite his family roots in Quebec, he was widely perceived
by the province's French-speaking majority as more of an outsider
than Bouchard, and less likely to do battle for the province in any
confrontations with the federal government.
	   Bouchard, 59, has maintained high popularity ratings despite
overseeing painful spending cuts over the past three years in a
drive to erase Quebec's deficit. Among Francophones, he has never
lost the mythic aura he gained when, after losing a leg and almost
dying from a flesh-eating disease in 1994, he came back to lead the
separatists to near-victory in a 1995 referendum on secession.
	   Though Bouchard has served in the federal Cabinet and federal
Parliament, this was the first time he ever ran as a party leader
in Quebec. He was appointed premier without an election in 1996
after his predecessor, Jacques Parizeau, resigned following the
1995 referendum.
	   There were 5.2 million eligible voters Monday, and turnout was
more than 80 percent even though this was the fourth province-wide
vote in the past five years.
	   Analysts had suggested that a landslide separatist victory _
approaching 50 percent of the popular vote _ would lead to pressure
from Parti Quebecois militants to hold a secession referendum
quickly. Monday's results were considered more likely to prompt a
cautious approach from Bouchard, and perhaps a wait of a year or
two before considering a referendum.
	   The separatists have lost secession referendums twice before,
once by a big margin in 1980 and just narrowly in 1995.
	   Bouchard, anxious to avoid a third defeat, said he would call
another referendum only when he was convinced the separatists would
win. In the meantime, he says he would seek more autonomy for all
10 provinces, particularly in regard to control over social
programs.
	   Many Quebeckers supported Bouchard even though they oppose
secession. Polls suggest only about 43 percent of Quebec voters
would support independence now, and about two-thirds do not want a
referendum on secession in the next few years.
	   To woo these voters, Bouchard tried to portray the election as
the choice of the most competent leadership, with the thorny
question of a referendum to be addressed at a later date.
	   The Liberals' chances clearly were hurt by the relatively strong
showing of Democratic Action, whose leader, 28-year-old Mario
Dumont, retained his seat in the legislature. His party, which
appeals to many young voters, favors greater autonomy for Quebec
but stops short of advocating outright secession.
	   About 83 percent of Quebec's 7.4 million people are French
speakers. The rest are divided among English-speakers with
long-term roots in Canada and more recently arrived immigrants from
southern Europe, Asia and elsewhere.
	   The long-term crusade for Quebec independence stems from a
feeling among many French Quebeckers that their culture is
different from the rest of Canada, plus a yearning to manage their
own affairs and have their own national symbols.

Report: Asia's first sextuplets a surprise for all
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Asia's first sextuplets astonished their
Indonesian parents and Singapore doctors who expected five babies
instead of six, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   One girl and five boys were delivered by Caesarean section
during a one-hour operation at Singapore's Gleneagles Hospital on
Friday.
	   ``I was stunned and overjoyed when the nurse ran out of the
operation theater and told me I had not five, but six babies,''
Indonesian businessman Andre Prijono, 30, was quoted as saying
Monday by The Straits Times.
	   Prijono and his wife, 26-year-old Susan Tjokrosetio, underwent
fertility treatment in March. Nature caught up with the first-time
parents in November.
	   Daughter Deidree was delivered first, followed by brothers
Danny, Davis, Dylon, and Douglas. The doctor only discovered
Dominick as he prepared for a post-delivery procedure.
	   ``I was about to remove the unusually heavy placenta when,
hello, I saw a baby's knee among the membranes,'' fertility expert
Dr. Christopher Chen was quoted as saying.
	   Five fetuses had appeared during ultrasound scans, said Chen,
who added that the hospital had only prepared a corresponding
number of incubators and doctors to care for each child.
	   ``We hoped for one pregnancy, but we ended up with six,'' said
Chen. ``I had not known that both parents had family records of
multiple pregnancies.''
	   The babies weighed between 1.26 and 1.82 kilograms (2.77 and
4.00 pounds) at birth, and were carried by their mother for a
record 33 weeks, said the report.
	   ``The nurses say my wife's a superwoman, but we aren't planning
any more children for the moment,'' said Prijono on Monday.

Death toll from strong Indonesian earthquake rises to 25

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The death toll from a powerful
earthquake that hit a remote island in Indonesia rose to 25 on
Tuesday, officials said.
	   The magnitude-6.5 quake hit Mangole island on Sunday night,
destroying buildings and houses and triggering landslides.
	   Initially six people were reported killed on the island, about
1,900 kilometers (1,180 miles) northeast of Indonesia's capital,
Jakarta.
	   However, the toll rose after reports were received from isolated
villages, said Budi Waluyo, an official from Indonesia's
Meteorological and Geophysics Agency in Jakarta.
	   Afraid that aftershocks might bring down their damaged homes,
about 7,000 people slept in tents or in the open.
	   Widespread damage was also reported on neighboring Taliabu
island, but there were no reports of deaths there.
	   Local government officials said more than 150 people were
injured and more than 180 homes and buildings were damaged on both
islands.
	   Some houses slid into the sea. Roads were cut and bridges
destroyed, hampering search and rescue efforts.
	   Neither island has a major hospital. A local government
official, Karim Wamona, said emergency flights were taking
seriously injured victims to neighboring islands for urgent
treatment.
	   Food and medicine were urgently needed, officials said.
	   Five of the dead were killed when the roof of a timber factory
collapsed.
	   Others were killed when their houses fell down. Some were killed
by landslides.
	   One landslide destroyed Mangole's main shipping dock.
	   On Tuesday electricity supplies remained cut in many places and
telecommunications with both islands were patchy.
	   The quake struck at 10:10 p.m. local time Sunday and was
centered beneath the Maluku Sea, about 370 kilometers (230 miles)
south of the city of Manado on the island of Sulawesi, the
Meteorological and Geophysics Agency said.
	   Mangole and Taliabu are part of the Maluku archipelago, known in
colonial times as the Spice Islands.
	   Earthquakes are common in Indonesia, which lies astride the
so-called Pacific ``Ring of Fire'' _ a line of volcanically active
areas that stretches from Central America and the western coast of
North America across to Japan, Southeast Asia, the South Pacific
and New Zealand.

	   ``They're in fair spirits,'' Crawford said of the crew, which
includes a Russian, a Japanese and an Australian.
	   ``They're surviving, of course, but they were down to their last
three days of food.''
	   The crew arrived on Wrangel Island on Sept. 2 to make a
documentary on polar bears. The trio had intended to leave Oct. 15,
but was delayed by bad weather. The weather has also kept Russia's
Emergency Situations Ministry from being able to carry out a
helicopter rescue.
	   The three had been holed up in a cabin on the island's northeast
coast, about 550 kilometers (350 miles) west of Alaska.
	   The crew's food supplies have been dwindling, and residents of a
Russian village about 130 kilometers (80 miles) from the hut had
been trying to drive a snow tractor to take emergency supplies to
the crew. The effort had been slowed by bad weather.
	   The temperature has been around minus 30 Celsius (minus 22
Fahrenheit), with a strong wind. The crew has a diesel generator, a
computer, a cellular phone and access to e-mail, but was running
low on fuel, news reports said.

Drunk teenagers stomp native animals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ At least one teenager who celebrated the
end of high school by kicking to death a small kangaroo-like animal
in an activity known as ``quokka soccer'' would be charged with
animal cruelty, police said Tuesday.
	   Authorities on Rottnest Island, the small isle 24 miles (40 kms)
off the coast of the capital of Western Australia state, found five
of the marsupials stomped after weekend celebrations by
school-leavers.
	   Island police Sgt. Merv Lockhart said he was waiting for a
formal complaint to be lodged by the Department of Conservation and
Land Management before charging an 18-year-old with animal cruelty
after he was seen kicking a quokka.
	   ``He admitted to police he kicked it to impress his mates,''
Lockhart said, adding that an example should be made of him.
	   If charged under the Wildlife Conservation Act, the teenager
will face a maximum fine of Australian dollars 10,000 (U.S. dlrs
6,300).
	   Up to 3,000 people flocked to the island for a weekend of
drinking and celebrations marking the end of the school year, and
the end of high school for the graduating class.
	   Police charged three teenagers with assault and one with
possessing amphetamines, and issued many warnings for drunk and
disorderly conduct, Lockhart said.
	   Rottnest Island is home to about 10,000 quokkas, the largest
population in Australia. They are found elsewhere only in very
small groups in the state's southwest. Quokka's are unique to
Australia.

China braces for rapid rise in AIDS cases, outlines prevention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China is bracing for a fourfold rise in AIDS
cases within two years and putting in place a 12-year plan to try
to slow the rapid increase.
	   Issued on the eve of Tuesday's World AIDS Day, China's AIDS
control program hopes to keep the number of people suffering from
the HIV virus that causes the disease to under 1.5 million by 2010,
the official Xinhua News Agency reported late Monday.
	   Although China has officially recorded 11,170 HIV cases, Health
Ministry officials estimate that more than 300,000 Chinese have the
disease. Xinhua said that number is expected to swell to 1.2
million by 2000.
	   To mark World AIDS Day and show greater government commitment to
controlling the disease, Beijing on Tuesday opened its first
exhibition on the disease, featuring photos of drug users and AIDS
patients.
	   For the first half of the 1990s, China's AIDS epidemic was
confined largely to counties along the southwestern border with
Southeast Asia's heroin producing region known as the Golden
Triangle. But flourishing drug and sex trades have carried the
disease into every part of China.
	   Citing unnamed government and AIDS experts, Xinhua said that
sharing of contaminated needles among drug users accounted for the
majority of HIV cases. In a worrying sign for the future, the
number of sexually transmitted diseases is increasing 16 percent
annually.
	   Under the Health Ministry's action plan, China hopes to lower
the growth rate of sexually transmitted diseases to 15 percent by
2002 and will launch a nationwide campaign to educate people how to
prevent AIDS, Xinhua said.
	   The AIDS control plan also vowed to:
	   _ educate 80 percent of prostitutes, drug users and other
high-risk groups; and 70 percent of city and 40 percent of rural
residents;
	   _ put education programs in all higher education, secondary and
vocational schools, drug rehabilitation centers, jails and labor
camps.
	   In addition, by 2005 the Health Ministry will set up a network
of 30 provincial laboratories and one national reference center to
monitor AIDS trends. Hospitals in major cities and areas with high
numbers of AIDS cases are supposed to set up treatment centers and
counseling services and purge their blood supplies of the disease.

High-tech Singapore installs telephones on buses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore already boasts a cyber bus equipped
with computer equipment used to teach workers new skills.
	   Now buses are installing telephones so that commuters can keep
in touch on the move.
	   Trans-Island Bus Service has placed a mobile phone on one of
their coaches for a month-long trial, and will outfit more buses if
the response is good, said The Straits Times on Tuesday.
	   During the trial, use of the phones is free, though calls will
be limited to three minutes, added the report.
	   In July, the subway rail system installed two phones on one
train for an initial six-month period.
	   Singapore's planners are constantly embracing the latest
technologies and working to implement them into general use.
	   For their part, many Singaporeans have a penchant for gadgets
and high-tech devices. Mobile phones and palmtop computers are now
so common that young teenagers are often seen toting the expensive
status symbols.

Report: ex-leader, family, friends own huge forest areas in
</HEADLINE>
Indonesia

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Ex-President Suharto, his family and
cronies control huge swathes of rain forest and other valuable
timber resources in Indonesia, a newspaper Tuesday quoted Cabinet
minister as saying.
	   Forestry and Plantations Minister Muslimin Nasution said
officials had found nine million hectares (22 millions) of forest
concessions linked to the former leader.
	   ``We found strong indications that those properties were
acquired by the Suharto family and their cronies through
(corruption, collusion and nepotism),'' Nasution said as reported
by The Jakarta Post.
	   Muslimin said the concessions were controlled by the family of
Suharto through shares held in various companies, including some
owned by timber tycoon and close Suharto associate Mohamad ``Bob''
Hasan.
	   Suharto, 77, who had ruled the world's fourth most populous
country with an iron hand since 1966, resigned in May amid
widespread student protests and riots that claimed about 1,200
lives.
	   The government is currently investigating the former president's
wealth amid mounting calls for him to stand trial for corruption
allegations.
	   Suharto has denied any wrongdoing and has stated that he will
cooperate with any investigation into his affairs. He has also
denied that he has squirreled away a fortune in foreign banks.
	   Critics have since accused him of siphoning off state wealth to
benefit his family's massive business empires.
	   Forbes magazine this year estimated Suharto's wealth at dlrs 4
billion. Some opponents claim it is many times that.
	   Environmnetalists have long criticized the cutting down of
Indonesia's jungles, which are home to many endangered species as
well as indigenous tribespeople.
	   Other investigations by various central and local government
agencies have found that the Suharto clan acquired vast areas of
land across many parts of the sprawling Southeast Asian nation.
	   On Monday, the government postponed the appointment of a
commission of inquiry into Suharto's wealth after it admitted that
not enough people had agreed to serve on the panel.
	   Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, ordered the
commission be set up after an earlier investigation by Attorney
General Andi Mohamad Ghalib failed to find any evidence against
Suharto. Many rejected it as a whitewash.
	   Student protesters have repeatedly tried to march on Suharto's
home in recent weeks, demanding that he be prosecuted for
corruption and human rights abuses. They also want his wealth to be
confiscated.
	   However, they have been blocked by large numbers of police and
troops.

New Prime Minister Hun Sen pushes for ASEAN entry
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Prime Minister Hun Sen pushed
Cambodia's case Tuesday for entry this month into the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations, saying the country had met all the
conditions.
	   ``I strongly hope there won't be any reasons to leave Cambodia
out of the regional framework, because we have fulfilled everything
we and our friends have required,'' Hun Sen said at a ceremony
introducing his trusted adviser, Hor Nam Hong, as the new foreign
minister.
	   But Hun Sen spoke as Singapore's Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar,
currently the chairman of ASEAN's standing committee, effectively
ruled out Cambodia's chances of being admitted before a Dec. 15-16
summit in Hanoi.
	   Jayakumar said he had no plans to convene an urgent meeting of
ASEAN foreign ministers and said the Hanoi meeting would focus on
the economic slowdown affecting the region, not Cambodia.
	   Parliament endorsed Hun Sen's new government Monday, taking
Cambodia a long way toward regaining international legitimacy lost
when Hun Sen ousted his co-premier, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a
coup last year.
	   Cambodia's seat in the United Nations has since been vacant and
its entry _ just weeks away at the time of the coup _ into ASEAN
suspended. ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
	   ASEAN was deeply involved in efforts to return a semblance of
democracy to Cambodia and helped engineer the return of Ranariddh
from abroad to lead his royalist party in new elections in July.
Hun Sen's party narrowly won.
	   The opposition alleged fraud and violence and held up formation
of a new government until Ranariddh, citing international pressure,
agreed to a compromise earlier this month that made Hun Sen sole
prime minister and the prince president of the National Assembly.
	   In a policy speech to parliament Monday, Hun Sen promised the
new government would carry out much-needed reforms that have been
identified by foreign aid providers as crucial to Cambodia's
development.
	   The prime minister reinforced his stance Tuesday, saying that
Cambodia's reentry into the international arena was the first step
in putting the struggling country back on track.
	   ``Getting the ASEAN and U.N. seats, along with normalization of
relations with international monetary institutions, like the IMF,
the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, are the most urgent
tasks,'' Hun Sen said.
	   Several foreign governments are already hinting that Cambodia
will see a return of aid that was sharply curtailed after
Ranariddh's ouster.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, in a letter to King
Norodom Sihanouk released Tuesday, said that ``Japan will not spare
any effort to ... support Cambodia's national reconstruction.''
	   Japan, Cambodia's single largest donor, was a key player in
bringing Ranariddh back for the election.

Bhutto warns of Taliban-style justice system in Pakistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
warned Tuesday that Pakistan was moving toward a judicial system
like the one in neighboring Afghanistan.
	   There the ruling Taliban militia amputate the limbs of thieves,
publicly execute murderers and beat people convicted of lesser
crimes.
	   In a letter to international human rights groups, as well as
several heads of state, including British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, Ms. Bhutto warned that ``Sharif's regime is intent to impose
a Taliban-like system of justice within Pakistan.''
	   Ms. Bhutto has been a vocal opponent of Sharif's attempts to
pass a constitutional amendment to bring Islamic rule to Pakistan.
	   The amendment already has been approved by Pakistan's powerful
lawmaking Lower House of Parliament, where Sharif has a comfortable
majority.
	   However, it needs to be passed by the Senate before becoming law
and it seems certain to be defeated.
	   But several lawmakers say that won't be the end of it, rather
they warned that they will demand a nationwide referendum if the
Senate defeats the amendment. Human rights groups worry a
referendum would be so vaguely worded as to be impossible to
defeat.
	   Ms. Bhutto's opposition to the proposed law has brought her
under heavy criticism from the country's right wing religious
politicians, some of whom have accused her of betraying Islam.
	   Ms. Bhutto warned that the rights of minorities and women in
Pakistan would be severely curtailed under Sharif's new Islamic
law, a charge his government has vehemently denied.
	   In her letter Ms. Bhutto asked world leaders ``to send a strong
message to the Sharif regime that the Taliban system of justice is
as unacceptable to the international community in Pakistan as it is
in Afghanistan.''
	   The Taliban army rules about 90 percent of Afghanistan where
it's brand of Islamic law has been imposed. As well as the
punishments, the Taliban have forced women off the job and girls
out of school, except to study the Muslim holy book, The Koran. Men
have been ordered to wear beards and women to wear the
all-enveloping burqa which covers them from head to toe.

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ A helicopter rescue team on Tuesday
reached a three-man television crew that had been stranded on a
remote Arctic island for more than six weeks, rescuers said.
	   The helicopter, sent by the international medical emergency
company AEA International SOS, landed on frozen Wrangel Island, at
about 3 p.m. local time (0200 GMT), said Mark Crawford, the
company's spokesman in Australia.
	   ``They're in fair spirits,'' Crawford said of the crew, which
includes a Russian, a Japanese and an Australian. ``They're
surviving, of course, but they were down to their last three days
of food.''
	   The crew _ Australian cameraman Rory McGuinness; Tatsuhko
Kobayashi, a producer with NHK, Japan's national broadcaster; and
Russian scientist Nikita Ovsyanikov _ arrived on Wrangel Island on
Sept. 2 to make a documentary about polar bears.
	   The trio had intended to leave Oct. 15, but was delayed by bad
weather which also prevented a helicopter rescue by Russia's
Emergency Situations Ministry.
	   The three had been holed up in a cabin on the island's northeast
coast, about 550 kilometers (350 miles) west of Alaska.
	   As the crew's food supplies dwindled, residents of a Russian
village about 130 kilometers (80 miles) from the hut tried to drive
a snow tractor carrying emergency supplies to the crew. But that
effort also was frustrated by the weather.
	   The temperature in the area had been around minus 30 Celsius
(minus 22 Fahrenheit), with a strong wind. The crew had a diesel
generator, a computer, a cellular phone and access to e-mail, but
was running low on fuel, news reports said.
	   Crawford said the trio would be flown to the Russian mainland at
Pevek.
	   The rescue was extremely difficult given, the remoteness of the
area, he said.
	   Crawford said his company had been hired to conduct the rescue
by the filmmakers' employer, Natural History Pty. Ltd., in New
Zealand.

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Several alleged associates of a Mexican
banker accused of fraud have been detained for investigation of
money laundering in the Dominican Republic, prosecutors announced
Monday.
	   The weekend detentions _ which netted three Italians, two Puerto
Ricans and two Dominicans _ appear to strengthen conjecture that
former banking magnate Carlos Cabal Peniche may have engaged in
money laundering, in addition to charges of bank fraud currently
pending against him.
	   The detentions were related to ``illegal acts committed by
Carlos Cabal Peniche in the Dominican Republic,'' where he fled
after charges were lodged against him in 1994 in Mexico, the
Attorney General's Office said in a press statement.
	   The alleged associates were detained by the Dominican National
Office of Drug Control for questioning about their possible
involvement in forgery and money laundering.
	   Dominican authorities have also seized properties on the
Caribbean island which allegedly belong to Cabal, who spent nearly
four years on the run before his capture in Australia on Nov. 10.
	   Prosecutors charged Cabal with violating banking laws after he
apparently misappropriated as much as dlrs 700 million from a bank
he owned.
	   But the Monday announcement also raises questions about how
Cabal built a business and banking empire in a few years in the
early 1990s. While prosecutors have not announced money laundering
charges against him, press reports have repeatedly questioned the
origin of his fortune.
	   Cabal rose from obscurity to the top levels of Mexico's business
world, mingling with political leaders in the early 1990s and
winning control of two formerly state-owned banks, Banco Union and
Banca Cremi.
	   Authorities say Cabal made loans to himself from his banks, a
practice that is subject to strict limits under Mexican law, and
never paid the money back.
	   Mexico has said it will seek his extradition from Australia, and
announced Monday that Australian police have also detained Cabal's
brother-in-law, Marco Pasini, for violating that country's
immigration laws.
	   Pasini faces charges in Mexico relating to Cabal's alleged bank
frauds, and also faces an extradition hearing.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two drivers were killed and 30 injured Tuesday
morning in a 16-vehicle pileup in foggy condition on a highway in
northern Japan, police said.
	   Two were in a critical condition and being treated at a local
hospital, said Fukushima Prefectural Police spokesman Akira
Takamiya. The other injuries were not life-threatening, he said.
	   Takamiya said the accident, which involved 13 large trucks, a
bus and three cars, occurred in Kita Aizu on a local expressway,
219 kilometers (130 miles), northeast of Tokyo.
	   ``The up lane was suddenly covered by a dense fog, reducing
visibility to just 30 meters (98 feet),'' Takamiya said, quoting a
bus driver involved in the pileup.
	   Takamiya said three people were temporarily trapped in their
vehicles, but later rescued by highway police.

Most Asian markets lower, Hong Kong shares plummet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets opened sharply lower
Tuesday, following Wall Street's lead, with Hong Kong share prices
diving for the third straight day of losses.
	   Hong Kong's key Hang Seng Index had plummeted 3.8 percent at
midday as the market digested a host of negative economic data and
Wall Street's fall.
	   The Hang Seng, the market's key indicator of blue chips, dipped
below the psychological level of 10,000 points before reversing
some of those losses to end the morning session at 10,007.98, down
394.34 points.
	   The market reacted to Wall Street's fall and concerns about Hong
Kong's economy, said Michael Ng, dealing director at Sassoon
Securities.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which touched a record high a
week ago, fell 216.53 points, or 2.3 percent, to end at 9,116.55
Monday.
	   Hong Kong's gross domestic product fell by 7 percent in the
third quarter, prompting the government to lower its economic
forecast a 5 percent contraction for 1998. Since the news was
announced Friday, the market has shed 6.8 percent.
	   Late Monday, the government reported its budget deficit for the
first seven months of the fiscal year had reached 50.16 billion
Hong Kong dollar (U.S. dlrs 6.43 billion), well above the 21
billion Hong Kong dollar (dlrs 2.69 billion) deficit the government
estimated for the fiscal year that ends March 31, 1999.
	   Market participants also said the Hang Seng index's plunge was a
natural correction as investors cashed in after sharp gains over
the past two months.
	   In Tokyo, the Nikkei average of 225 selected issues was up 4.33
points at 14,888.03 in early afternoon trade. It shed 100 points
earlier in the day following Wall Street and news that a
financially troubled contractor had filed for legal protection from
creditors.
	   Singapore share prices were sharply lower midday, with the
benchmark Straits Times Index down 45.77 points, or 3.2 percent, to
1,370.78.
	   Other Asian markets opened lower taking cue from Wall Street,
Hong Kong, and Singapore, traders said.

Chinese fishermen hurl explosives at Taiwan coast guard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwanese police shot a Chinese fishermen
in the leg after he and other crew members hurled dynamite at a
Taiwanese patrol boat, police said Tuesday.
	   Fisherman Lin Chuanshou, 25, was in fair condition after being
hospitalized with a bullet wound on the Taiwanese-held Matsu island
group, Matsu marine police chief Tsai Yu-chen said.
	   Four other crew members of the boat who dove overboard to avoid
capture were rescued and being held at Military Police headquarters
on Matsu, Tsai said.
	   The crew had ignored a command from Taiwanese marine police to
stop late Sunday night after the boat was reported exploding
dynamite under the water to kill fish.
	   Crewmen threw five bundles of explosives at two Taiwanese boats
when they approached, missing each time, said Tsai.
	   Taiwanese police towed the boat, registered in the Fujian
province port of Huangqi, back to Matsu where they searched it and
discovered 419 sticks of dynamite and 126 percussion caps aboard.
	   The five fishermen will likely be tried in Taiwan on charges of
violating fishing laws. They will serve a prison sentence here if
convicted, before being sent home to the mainland, Tsai said.
	   Tsai said his office receives frequent reports of dynamite
fishing by Chinese boats, which poses a severe danger to both the
marine environment and other fishing boats.
	   The Matsu island group lies just 10 miles (6 kilometers) off the
coast of Fujian.

	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Quebec's pro-independence government was
re-elected, but won only about 43 percent of the popular vote,
likely dampening its zest for holding a secession referendum any
time soon.
	   The outcome of Monday's vote means a new term of up to five
years for Quebec's charismatic premier, Lucien Bouchard, who says
he will call a referendum on independence whenever he feels the
separatist side can win.
	   But he may need to wait a while for what he calls the ``winning
conditions.'' His Parti Quebecois retained its big majority in the
legislature, but was narrowly outpolled in the popular vote by its
anti-separatist rival, the Quebec Liberal Party.
	   With almost all 23,000 polling stations reporting late Monday,
the separatists had 42.7 percent of the votes, to 43.7 percent for
the Liberals and 12 percent for a third party, Democratic Action.
	   But despite the close popular vote, the Liberals lagged far
behind in the individual races for seats in the legislature because
their support was heavily concentrated in a few areas of the
province. The Parti Quebecois ran well among French-speakers in
most areas of the province.
	   The separatists were on track to win 75 of the legislature's 125
seats, the Liberals 48 and Democratic Action one, with one seat to
be filled later because the separatist candidate recently died.
	   The outcome was a virtual replay of 1994, when the separatists
won 77 seats to 47 for the Liberals while each receiving about 44
percent of the popular vote.
	   Bouchard, in his victory speech, paid tribute to his opponents
and pledged to work with them on policy matters. But he also
promised to work for the ``winning conditions'' that would make
independence possible.
	   ``Our first priority is to advance Quebec ... to push it farther
toward its destiny,'' he said.
	   Bouchard's main rival was Liberal party leader Jean Charest, who
tried to convince voters that the province would prosper only if
the decades-old threat of secession was abandoned.
	   Charest, 40, became an early favorite when he quit federal
politics in March to enter the Quebec race; in English-speaking
Canada he was viewed as the potential savior of national unity.
	   He then dropped behind in the polls, and appeared relieved by
his party's strong showing in the popular vote.
	   ``The result tonight ... reflects the fact that the people of
Quebec, like the people of all Canada, want this country of ours to
work and be a success,'' he told supporters in his home district of
Sherbrooke.
	   Charest confirmed that would stay on as Liberal leader in the
legislature.
	   Bouchard, 59, has maintained high popularity ratings despite
overseeing painful spending cuts over the past three years in a
drive to erase Quebec's deficit. Among Francophones, he has never
lost the mythic aura he gained when, after losing a leg and almost
dying from a flesh-eating disease in 1994, he came back to lead the
separatists to near-victory in a 1995 referendum on secession.
	   Though Bouchard has served in the federal Cabinet and federal
Parliament, this was the first time he ever ran as a party leader
in Quebec. He was appointed premier without an election in 1996
after his predecessor, Jacques Parizeau, resigned following the
1995 referendum.
	   There were 5.2 million eligible voters Monday, and turnout was
more than 80 percent even though this was the fourth province-wide
vote in the past five years.
	   Analysts had suggested that a landslide separatist victory _
approaching 50 percent of the popular vote _ would lead to pressure
from Parti Quebecois militants to hold a secession referendum
quickly. Monday's results were considered more likely to prompt a
cautious approach from Bouchard, and perhaps a wait of a year or
two before considering a referendum.
	   The separatists have lost secession referendums twice before,
once by a big margin in 1980 and just narrowly in 1995.
	   Bouchard, anxious to avoid a third defeat, said he would call
another referendum only when he was convinced the separatists would
win. In the meantime, he says he would seek more autonomy for all
10 provinces, particularly in regard to control over social
programs.
	   Many Quebeckers supported Bouchard even though they oppose
secession. Polls suggest only about 43 percent of Quebec voters
would support independence now, and about two-thirds do not want a
referendum on secession in the next few years.
	   To woo these voters, Bouchard tried to portray the election as
the choice of the most competent leadership, with the thorny
question of a referendum to be addressed at a later date.
	   The Liberals' chances clearly were hurt by the relatively strong
showing of Democratic Action, whose leader, 28-year-old Mario
Dumont, retained his seat in the legislature. His party, which
appeals to many young voters, favors greater autonomy for Quebec
but stops short of advocating outright secession.
	   About 83 percent of Quebec's 7.4 million people are French
speakers. The rest are divided among English-speakers with
long-term roots in Canada and more recently arrived immigrants from
southern Europe, Asia and elsewhere.
	   The long-term crusade for Quebec independence stems from a
feeling among many French Quebeckers that their culture is
different from the rest of Canada, plus a yearning to manage their
own affairs and have their own national symbols.

Plunging stock market, more layoffs plague Hong Kong's battered
</HEADLINE>
economy
 &UR; By PRISCILLA CHEUNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The beleaguered Hong Kong economy was hit
Tuesday with another string of bad news _ the key stock index fell
nearly 4 percent, more companies announced layoffs, and the
financial secretary hinted at a second straight budget deficit in
the next fiscal year.
	   Prominent U.S. think-tank Heritage Foundation said in a report
released Tuesday that Singapore has unseated Hong Kong as the
world's freest economy. Singapore has been trying to replace the
territory as the region's leading financial services provider.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index, which fell 3.2 percent Monday,
plummeted further Tuesday morning, falling below the psychological
support level of 10,000 points at one point.
	   It later reversed course, closing the midday session at
10,007.98 _ 3.8 percent lower than Monday's close.
	   The index already has shed 6.8 percent since last Friday, when
the government announced that the economy shrank 7 percent in the
third quarter, the biggest decline recorded for Hong Kong in the
post-War era.
	   ``People are worried about the surge in unemployment, high
interest rates and falling inflation,'' said Michael Ng, dealing
director at Sassoon Securities.
	   More than 450 people have lost their jobs this week so far as a
restaurant closed its doors Monday and two major companies _ Hong
Kong Aircraft Engineering Company and Citibank _ announced layoffs.
	   Unemployment, already at 5.3 percent, the highest level since
1981 when officials started collecting such data, is expected to
climb further.
	   The territory also is bracing itself for deflation as spending
continues to fall.
	   Despite the grim economic outlook, Financial Secretary Donald
Tsang warned in an address to business leaders Tuesday that the
government has limited scope to increase spending and to cut taxes
as the budget deficit grows.
	   On Monday, the government reported that it posted a gaping 50.16
billion Hong Kong dollar (U.S. dlrs 6.43 billion) deficit in the
first seven months of this fiscal year, well above an earlier
forecast of 21 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 2.69 billion) for
the entire fiscal year.
	   Tsang also hinted at a second straight budget deficit in the
next fiscal year beginning April 1, 1999.
	   It's unusual for the Hong Kong government, which has
traditionally followed the credo of never spending more than it
brings in, to run a deficit two years in a row.
	   In another blow to the battered economy, the Heritage Foundation
said Hong Kong has lost its title as the world's freest economy to
Singapore.
	   At a news conference, Edwin Feulner, the think-tank's president,
said the government's unprecedented market intervention in August
had cost it the title it had held for three straight years.
	   To drive out speculators who were trying to depress stock prices
and drive up interest rates, the government launched a stock and
stock futures buying spree to prop up share prices, and later
change the rules in the futures trading to tighten control.
	   Tsang reiterated that the intervention was a one-time action.
	   ``We are not a command economy, we are a free economy _ by any
fair measure, the freest in the world,'' he said. ``Hong Kong will
never close its markets to goods or services. We will never have
exchange controls.''

U.N. urges Bosnian parties to hand over indicted war criminals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. General Assembly demanded full
implementation of the Bosnia peace agreement and called on all
parties to hand over all those indicted for war crimes to an
international tribunal.
	   Without a vote, the assembly on Monday adopted a resolution
which underlined that international assistance for Bosnia remains
conditional on strict compliance with the Dayton peace agreement
and subsequent obligations, including cooperation with the
tribunal.
	   The tribunal at The Hague in the Netherlands was set up by the
U.N. Security Council in 1993. At least 20 war crimes suspects
remain at large in Bosnia, including the wartime Bosnian Serb
leader, Radovan Karadzic, and his military commander Gen. Ratko
Mladic.
	   While Russia supports the international tribunal, Moscow's
Deputy Ambassador Yuriy Fedotov said his government opposed any
military or police actions to capture suspected war criminals.
	   He noted that the Dayton accord and the tribunal's statutes
clearly stated that any extradition should be carried out
exclusively on the basis of cooperation.
	   The assembly resolution also encouraged all parties to
accelerate the peaceful and orderly return of refugees and
internally displaced persons to all areas of the country, including
those where they would be an ethnic minority.
	   The resolution, which is not legally binding, condemned all acts
of intimidation, violence and killings, including acts designed to
discourage the return of refugees. It demanded that such acts be
investigated and prosecuted.
	   Austrian Ambassador Ernst Sucharipa, speaking on behalf of the
European Union, said there was no alternative to the 1995 Dayton
agreement.
	   The holding of free and fair elections in September was only an
initial step in the construction of a democratic society, he said,
urging Muslims, Croats and Serbs to cooperate to implement the
election results.
	   The reform of the judicial system and the restructuring of the
civilian police were crucial to the establishment of the rule of
law, Sucharipa said.
	   Saying the current level of international support could not be
maintained indefinitely, Russia's Fedotov called on all parties to
confirm their willingness to implement the Dayton agreement and
achieve genuine inter-ethnic reconciliation.
	   Bosnia's Ambassador Mohammed Sacirbey called for continued
support for judicial and police reforms, ``especially where local
authorities may be resistant to or not reflect the commitment to
pluralism.''
	   He also expressed dismay at the failure of Yugoslavia ``to
establish diplomatic relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina, without
precondition.''

Russians rescue TV crew trapped on Arctic island
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian helicopter Tuesday rescued a three-man
television crew that had been stranded on a remote Arctic island by
bad weather and was running out of food and other supplies,
officials said.
	   A helicopter from the Ministry of Emergency Situations evacuated
the trio, which included a Russian, a Japanese and an Australian
who had been making a documentary on polar bears. The crew was
taken to the port of Pevek, a ministry spokesman said.
	   The crew arrived on Wrangel Island on Sept. 2 and intended to
leave Oct. 15, but were delayed by bad weather. The weather also
prevented the Emergency Situations Ministry from sending a rescue
helicopter.
	   The three were holed up in a cabin on the island's northeast
coast, about 550 kilometers (350 miles) west of Alaska.
	   Their food supplies were running out, raising concerns about the
men. Residents of a village about 130 kilometers (80 miles) from
the hut attempted to take emergency supplies to the crew, but were
defeated by bad weather.
	   The temperature on the island has been around minus 30 Celsius
(minus 22 Fahrenheit), with a strong wind.
	   The Japanese crew member, Tatsuhiko Kobayashi, developed
complications from a recent eye operation, Russia's ORT television
reported.
	   Emergency officials earlier offered to try to rescue the crew by
snow tractor, but the three reportedly turned down the offer
because they would have been forced to leave most of their
equipment behind, ORT television reported.
	   Kobayashi is an employee of NHK, the Japanese television
company. The Australian is cameraman John McGuiness. The name of
the Russian was not available.

Report: Fuji Heavy Industries chairman arrested in bribery scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prosecutors arrested the chairman of Fuji Heavy
Industries Tuesday on suspicion of bribing a ruling party
legislator for help in obtaining a defense contract, Japanese media
reports said.
	   Fuji Heavy Chairman Isamu Kawai, 70, was arrested after
prosecutors raided the company's headquarters to search for
evidence, Kyodo News reported.
	   Kawai and other top executives allegedly asked Yojiro Nakajima,
who has been arrested on separate charges, for help in obtaining a
contract to develop an amphibian airplane for Japan's Marine
Self-Defense Forces.
	   The executives are suspected of bribing Nakajima while he was a
parliamentary vice defense minister.
	   Prosecutors and company officials would not confirm the arrest.
	   Last week, prosecutors arrested Yasuyuki Kogure, 64, a former
Fuji Heavy executive director, on charges of giving 5 million yen
(dlrs 41,000) in kickbacks to Nakajima.
	   Nakajima, 39, a Liberal Democratic Party member of Parliament,
was arrested last month on charges of ordering false receipts made
to account for missing party money. The arrest was unrelated to the
Fuji Heavy Industries case.
	   Investigators also suspect money Fuji Heavy Industries gave to
Nakajima was used to bribe other members of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party and his supporters in preparation for an election.
	   Fuji Heavy Industries, maker of Subaru automobiles, has said it
donated 4 million yen (dlrs 33,000) to Nakajima since 1993, and
bought 740,000 yen (dlrs 6,115) worth of tickets for fund-raising
parties for the lawmaker.
	   In a separate scandal involving the Defense Agency, ministry
officials are being investigated for allowing NEC Corp. inflate
defense contract bills in exchange for executive posts for retiring
bureaucrats.
	   Two Defense Agency officials have been indicted in the scandal,
as have a dozen employees at NEC and two of its subsidiaries.
	   Defense Minister Fukushiro Nukaga resigned last week to take
responsibility for the scandal.
	   Japan's political world has been rocked by a series of
corruption scandals in recent years that have exposed cozy ties
between government officials and businesses.

Dollar traded lower, stocks finish lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar and bond

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen Tuesday in
Tokyo following an overnight decline on Wall Street. Japanese
stocks finished the day's trading lower.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 48.29 points,
or 0.32 percent, closing the day's trading at 14,835.41 points. On
Monday, the Nikkei closed down 185.69 points, or 1.23 percent.
	   In mid-afternoon trading, the U.S. dollar bought 122.88 yen,
down 0.94 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New
York level of 123.26 yen overnight.
	   The dollar's weakness was largely because of the overnight fall
in U.S. stocks, traders said. The Dow Jones industrial average
closed at 9,116.55 on Monday, down 216.53 points, or 2.3 percent.
	   ``The margin of fall in the Dow was quite big. That has muted
the bullish sentiment over the U.S. economy and the dollar
somewhat,'' said Yukihiko Hashimoto, senior manager of the treasury
and funding department of Sanwa Bank.
	   Among those selling the dollar were U.S. hedge funds and
Japanese institutional investors, traders said.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, market sentiments remained bearish
because of the fall on Wall Street as well as local news reports
that Tokyo-based JDC Corp., a medium-sized general contractor, was
seeking court protection from creditors.
	   JDC later confirmed that it filed for protection with the Tokyo
District Court Tuesday morning with debts totaling 406.7 billion
yen (dlrs 3.33 billion) from failed golf course and other projects.
	   It was the biggest bankruptcy of a Japanese general contractor
since Tokai Kogyo Co. went under last year after amassing debts of
511 billion yen (dlrs 4.18 billion), according to Teikoku Data
Bank, a Tokyo think tank.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 1.24 points, or 0.11 percent, to 1,142.26 points.
The TOPIX closed down 14.85 points, or 1.28 percent, the day
before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.140 percent from Monday's finish of 1.040 percent,
driving its price down to 105.68 yen from 106.59 yen.

Report: Singapore soccer referee jailed for match fixing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A Singapore soccer referee was jailed for eight
months for accepting bribes to fix a match two years ago, a
newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Ramasamy Rajandran, 45, of the Football Association of
Singapore, which oversees the domestic soccer league, was sentenced
Monday in a district court for fixing an August 1996 match between
Police Football Club and Sembawang Rangers, The Straits Times said.
	   Singapore's Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau received a
tip and arrested him on three charges of corruption. Ramasamy was
also fined 10,250 Singapore dollars (dlrs 6,200).

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ France's oil giant Total SA took over
Belgian petrochemicals company Petrofina SA to create the sixth
largest oil company in the world and the third largest in Europe,
the companies announced Tuesday.
	   The new company will be known as Total Fina and the move was the
latest in a series of mergers affecting the global oil market. The
new company will be quoted on the Paris, Brussels, New York and
London stock exchanges, a Petrofina statement said.
	   Petrofina's stock stood at 14,250 francs (dlrs 407.9) Friday
before it was suspended for Monday's trading. The deal put the
value at 19.482 francs (dlrs 557.7), a jump in value of over a
quarter.
	   The agreement is based on a share swap pact that gives 9 Total
Fina shares for 2 Petrofina shares. The move gives Total a
controlling stake of 41 percent in Petrofina.
	   A combined general meeting of shareholders has been called for
Jan. 14 to approve the agreement. Total said a public offering on
the remaining Petrofina shares will follow.
	   The move made Belgian investor Albert Frere, who controlled 30
percent of Petrofina shares, the biggest shareholder of Total.
	   Petrofina stock has been gaining ground in recent days on rumors
that the company was in talks with France's Elf Aquitaine SA, Total
SA and Italy's ENI SpA. Trading in shares was stopped Monday when a
local newspaper broke the news a deal was near.
	   Petrofina, which employs some 15,000 people worldwide is one of
Belgium's biggest industrial companies. It has myriad interests in
other enterprises, including energy company Electrabel, utilities
company Tractebel SA, holding companies Companie National a
Portefeuille, Sidro, Sofina SA, Groupe Bruxelles Lambert SA and
Electrafina SA.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Rescue teams continued their search
for survivors, as the death toll from a powerful earthquake that
hit a remote island in Indonesia rose to 25 on Tuesday.
	   The magnitude-6.5 quake hit Mangole island on Sunday night,
destroying buildings and houses and setting off landslides.
	   Strong aftershocks continued to rock the island Tuesday,
hampering rescue efforts and frightening villagers.
	   Initially six people were reported killed on the island, about
1,900 kilometers (1,180 miles) northeast of Indonesia's capital,
Jakarta.
	   The toll rose after reports came in from isolated villages, said
Budi Waluyo, an official from Indonesia's Meteorological and
Geophysics Agency in Jakarta.
	   Local government official Wahab Konoras said at least eight
villagers were still missing Tuesday.
	   ``Rescue teams are looking for more possible victims in remote
areas. The toll could rise further,'' he said in a telephone
interview from Ternate, the capital of North Maluku regency.
	   Afraid that aftershocks might bring down their damaged homes,
about 7,000 people slept in tents or in the open.
	   Widespread damage was also reported on neighboring Taliabu
island, but there were no reports of deaths there.
	   Local government officials said more than 150 people were
injured and more than 858 homes, churches, mosques and other
buildings were damaged on both islands. Mangole's main government
buildings were flattened.
	   Some houses slid into the sea. Roads were cut and bridges
destroyed, hampering search and rescue efforts.
	   Neither island has a major hospital. A local government
official, Karim Wamona, said emergency flights were taking
seriously injured victims to neighboring islands. Food and medicine
were urgently needed, officials said.
	   Five of the dead were killed when the roof of a timber factory
collapsed. Others were killed when their houses fell down. Some
were killed by landslides.
	   One landslide destroyed Mangole's main shipping dock.
	   On Tuesday electricity supplies remained cut in many places and
telecommunications with both islands were patchy.
	   The quake struck at 10:10 p.m. local time Sunday and was
centered beneath the Maluku Sea, about 370 kilometers (230 miles)
south of the city of Manado on the island of Sulawesi, the
Meteorological and Geophysics Agency said.
	   Mangole and Taliabu are part of the Maluku archipelago, known in
colonial times as the Spice Islands.

Hong Kong government urged to cut airport fees to keep competitive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong needs to cut fees at its new airport
to maintain the territory's position as a regional air hub after
business rival Singapore slashed airport landing fees last week,
the chairman of Hong Kong's flag carrier said Tuesday.
	   The request came a day after leading aircraft maintenance
company Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering sacked 352 employees, or 8
percent of its staff, citing soaring operation costs at the newly
opened Cheek Lap Kok airport.
	   Speaking at a business gathering, Peter Sutch, chairman of
Cathay Pacific Airways and Swire Pacific Ltd., said Hong Kong risks
losing its competitiveness unless the government and Airport
Authority cut fees, even though it still has an important edge in
terms of its geographic location.
	   ``Unless we get our cost base right, we'll lose our position to
other hubs in the region,'' Sutch said.
	   Singapore's Civil Aviation Authority on Friday said it will cut
aircraft landing fees at Changi Airport by 10 percent for a year
beginning Jan. 1 as part of the government's package to reduce the
cost of doing business in the city-state.
	   By bringing the fees to about the level in 1981, when the
airport was first opened, airlines will be able to save about dlrs
11 million, the authority said.
	   Hong Kong's Airport Authority created a furor last year when it
set landing and usage fees at Hong Kong's new airport, which opened
in early July, at levels well above those at the old Kai Tak
Airport. It later lowered the fees, but they remain higher than
those that had been charged at Kai Tak.
	   The aircraft maintenance company said Monday it needed to cut
staff partly due to the extra costs of 50 million Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 6.4 million) in rent at the new airport and 15 million
Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.9 million) in royalties paid to the
Airport Authority, the South China Morning Post reported.
	   ``We're not blaming the Airport Authority _ the issue of charges
at Chek Lap Kok is ongoing. It's certainly one of the most
expensive airports to operate from in the world,'' commercial
director John Paterson was quoted as saying.
	   Swire Pacific has the controlling stake in both Cathay Pacific
and the maintenance company.

Myanmar tells U.S. Embassy detained tourists have been freed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar officials told the U.S. Embassy
on Tuesday that three foreign tourists detained after illegally
crossing into the country from Thailand have been released, a week
after they were first reported detained.
	   An embassy official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the Foreign Ministry had informed the embassy that the trio _ an
American, a Canadian and a German _ were taken to a border
checkpoint and sent back to Thailand. The ministry did not disclose
precisely when or where.
	   U.S. consular officials never received access to the American,
identified as Michael John Raedeke, 40, the official said. The
other tourists have been identified as Joseph Frank, 34, a Canadian
resident of Hong Kong, and Dirk Rommeswinkel of Germany.
	   Myanmar officials confirmed last week that the trio had been
found inside the country, also known as Burma, and were brought to
Taunggyi, about 175 kilometers (110 miles) from where they were
detained, for questioning by immigration officials.
	   The tourists were seen riding rented motorcycles in the rugged
border region around Thailand's western Mae Hong Son province. Thai
troops saw them drive across the frontier at Ban Mai Kai On Pass
but were unable to get their attention.
	   Myanmar has strict security measures in the border regions.
Armed rebel groups have been active in some areas.

Helicopter rescues TV crew trapped on Arctic island

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian helicopter Tuesday rescued a three-man
television crew that had been stranded on a remote Arctic island by
bad weather and was running out of food and other supplies,
officials said.
	   The helicopter evacuated the trio, which included a Russian, a
Japanese and an Australian who had been making a documentary on
polar bears. The crew was taken to the port of Pevek, the Ministry
of Emergency Situations said.
	   There were conflicting reports on who organized the rescue.
Ministry spokesman Viktor Beltsov said the rescue was organized by
his agency using an Mi-8 helicopter hired from a private airline.
	   But the international medical emergency company AEA
International SOS said it had organized the rescue, according to
Mark Crawford, the company's spokesman in Australia.
	   ``They're in fair spirits,'' Crawford said of the crew.
``They're surviving, of course, but they were down to their last
three days of food.''
	   Crawford said his company had been hired to conduct the rescue
by the filmmakers' employer, Natural History Pty. Ltd., in New
Zealand.
	   The film crew arrived on Wrangel Island on Sept. 2 and intended
to leave Oct. 15, but were delayed by bad weather. The weather also
prevented the Emergency Situations Ministry from sending a rescue
helicopter.
	   The three were holed up in a cabin on the island's northeast
coast, about 550 kilometers (350 miles) west of Alaska.
	   Their food supplies were running out, raising concerns about the
men. Residents of a village about 130 kilometers (80 miles) from
the hut attempted to take emergency supplies to the crew, but were
defeated by bad weather.
	   The temperature on the island has been around minus 30 Celsius
(minus 22 Fahrenheit), with strong winds.
	   The Japanese crew member, Tatsuhiko Kobayashi, developed
complications from a recent eye operation, Russia's ORT television
reported.
	   Emergency officials earlier offered to try to rescue the crew by
snow tractor, but the three reportedly turned down the offer
because they would have been forced to leave most of their
equipment behind, ORT television reported.
	   Kobayashi is an employee of NHK, the Japanese television
company. The Australian is cameraman John McGuiness. They were
accompanied by Russian researcher Nikita Ovsyannikov.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ France's oil giant Total SA took over
the Belgian petrochemicals company Petrofina SA to create the
sixth-largest oil company in the world and the third-largest in
Europe, the companies announced Tuesday.
	   The new company, known as Total Fina, will be quoted on the
Paris, Brussels, New York and London stock exchanges, a Petrofina
statement said. The move was the latest in a series of mergers
affecting the global oil market.
	   ``The combination of Total and Petrofina will allow the new
entity to capture substantial productivity gains, particularly in
the North Sea, and to expand its positions in the deep offshore
(United States, Angola),'' Petrofina said in a statement.
	   The market capitalization of both companies combined stood at
1,391 billion Belgian francs (dlrs 39.9 billion).
	   Petrofina's stock stood at 14,250 francs (dlrs 407.9) Friday
before it was suspended for Monday's trading. The deal put the
value at 19.482 francs (dlrs 557.7), a jump in value of more than a
third.
	   The agreement is based on a stock swap that provides nine Total
Fina shares for two Petrofina shares. Total Fina will have a
controlling stake in 41 percent of Petrofina, which specializes in
refinery.
	   ``In refining-marketing, Total Fina will hold solid positions''
in the European Union. ``Joint management of the refineries and the
marketing networks should yield substantial productivity gains,''
the statement said.
	   A combined general meeting of shareholders has been called for
Jan. 14 to approve the agreement. Total said a public offering on
the remaining Petrofina shares will follow.
	   The move made Belgian investor Albert Frere, who controlled 30
percent of Petrofina shares, the biggest shareholder of Total Fina.
	   Petrofina stock has been gaining ground in recent days on rumors
that the company was in talks with France's Elf Aquitaine SA, Total
SA and Italy's ENI SpA.
	   Petrofina, which employs 15,000 people worldwide, is one of
Belgium's biggest industrial companies. It has interests in other
enterprises, including energy company Electrabel, utilities company
Tractebel SA, and holding companies Companie National a
Portefeuille, Sidro, Sofina SA, Groupe Bruxelles Lambert SA and
Electrafina SA.

Nobel laureate calls for release of Malaysian activist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jose
Ramos Horta on Tuesday called for the release of an outspoken
Malaysian human rights activist who was arrested during an
anti-government demonstration.
	   ``I demand that the Malaysian police immediately release Tian
Chua and all those arrested at the pro-reformasi demonstration,''
Ramos Horta said in a statement faxed from Sydney, Australia.
	   Tian was arrested Nov. 21 shortly after a demonstration by
supporters of jailed former Malaysian deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim.
	   It was the third time that Tian, chairman of the opposition
Coalition of People's Democracy, had been picked up by police for
demanding political reforms and protesting against the government
of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Tian won a bail appeal Monday. But as soon as he walked out of
the courthouse, police nabbed him and arrested him again.
	   On Tuesday, Tian appeared at a courthouse in his Kuala Lumpur
neighborhood of Petaling Jaya. The judge did not charge him with a
crime, but ordered him to be held for five days while police
investigate possible charges.
	   The judge also ordered that Tian be taken to a hospital for
treatment of asthma.
	   ``I'm fine -- and they did not beat me up in the lock-up
yesterday,'' Tian told supporters outside the courthouse. ``Keep up
the fight.''
	   Members of Tian's coalition, which comprises 20 human rights and
opposition political groups, have protested that he was beaten
while in police custody.
	   ``Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, together with his
Gestapo-like police force, in their vendetta against reform-minded
Anwar Ibrahim, is ripping away the foundations of justice and
democracy in Malaysia,'' Ramos Horta said.
	   ``This has to stop immediately.''
	   Ramos Horta, who promotes independence for Indonesian East
Timor, praised Tian's role in that struggle.
	   ``Tian Chua is in the forefront of the struggle for freedom and
democracy in Malaysia and is well-known in the region for his brave
stand against the Indonesian occupation of East Timor,'' he said.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ People across Asia handed out condoms and wore red
ribbons Tuesday as part of efforts on World AIDS Day to raise
awareness about the spread of the disease, especially in
underdeveloped countries.
	   In Japan, the Health Ministry organized rallies and charity
concerts in central Tokyo to spread the word about AIDS and express
solidarity with those suffering from the disease.
	   ``It's extremely important to have an event every year to
repeatedly remind people that AIDS exists,'' said Dr. Yoshiki
Sakurai, an official of the Japanese Foundation for AIDS
Prevention.
	   Events in Tokyo will culminate with the lighting of a tree
decorated with home-made red-ribbons, the symbol of AIDS
solidarity, sent in from across Japan.
	   Discrimination against AIDS sufferers remains a serious problem
in Japan, and the country still lags behind many Western countries
in AIDS treatment facilities and education.
	   ``We have to move on from the current situation in Japan where
people with HIV are isolated, to one in which they are accepted as
full members of society, with jobs,'' said Satoru Ienishi, a member
of Parliament.
	   Ienishi was among the thousands of Japanese hemophiliacs who
contracted the AIDS virus through the use of government-approved
blood products tainted by HIV.
	   ``The taboo against AIDS is so strong in Japan that people with
HIV are less likely to die from AIDS than from economic
difficulty'' caused by their alienation from society, he said in a
telephone interview.
	   In China, the government marked World AIDS Day by opening its
first exhibition on the disease, featuring photos of drug users and
AIDS patients.
	   The government also unveiled a new AIDS control program that
will include a nationwide campaign to educate people on how to
prevent AIDS. China is expecting a fourfold rise in AIDS cases
within two years.
	   It has officially recorded 11,170 HIV cases, but Health Ministry
officials estimate that more than 300,000 Chinese have the disease.
	   In Hong Kong, bars, restaurants and nightclubs handed out beer
coasters warning people to practice safe sex as part of a
three-week AIDS awareness program organized by support group AIDS
Concern.
	   The colorful coasters feature pictures of a fluorescent condom
on one side, with a safe sex messages on the reverse.
	   One version of the coaster reads: ``Do it safely; use a condom
every time.''
	   Aids Concern also handed out 5,000 condoms at subway stations in
Hong Kong on Tuesday morning.
	   The theme of the 11th World AIDS Day is ``Be a force for
change.''
	   Experts have warned recently that although powerful new drugs
have sent AIDS deaths plunging in industrialized countries, the
disease continues to kill millions of people in impoverished
nations in Africa and Asia.
	   According to a new U.N. report, about 33.4 million people around
the world are infected with HIV, two-thirds of them in sub-Saharan
Africa. Two million people will die of the disease south of the
Sahara this year, four times the total for the rest of the world.
	   About 1.7 million people in Africa and 700,000 people in Asia
and the Pacific are infected with HIV every year, according to U.N.
figures.
	   The Cambodian government marked AIDS day with the grim
announcement that 150,000 people _ 1.3 percent of the population _
are infected with the AIDS virus.
	   Officials said that 50 to 70 people catch HIV in Cambodia every
day, the highest HIV infection rate in Asia.
	   The economic crisis sweeping through Southeast Asia has made it
even more difficult for governments in the region to curb the
spread of AIDS.
	   On the eve of AIDS day, Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa
launched a plea at the United Nations for governments around the
world to contribute more funds to the worldwide fight against AIDS.
	   ``We aren't doing enough to say to governments, for goodness
sake, why have so much money for death and so little for life,''
Tutu said
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton prepared to mark AIDS day with the
announcement of dlrs 10 million in emergency grants to help poorer
nations care for children orphaned by AIDS.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ France's oil giant Total SA took over
the Belgian petrochemicals company Petrofina SA to create the
sixth-largest oil company in the world and the third-largest in
Europe, the companies announced Tuesday.
	   The new company, known as Total Fina, will be quoted on the
Paris, Brussels, New York and London stock exchanges, a Petrofina
statement said. The move was the latest in a series of mergers
affecting the global oil market.
	   ``The combination of Total and Petrofina will allow the new
entity to capture substantial productivity gains, particularly in
the North Sea, and to expand its positions in the deep offshore
(United States, Angola),'' Petrofina said in a statement.
	   The market capitalization of both companies combined stood at
1,391 billion Belgian francs (dlrs 39.9 billion).
	   Petrofina's stock stood at 14,250 francs (dlrs 407.9) Friday
before it was suspended for Monday's trading. The deal put the
value at 19.482 francs (dlrs 557.7), a jump in value of more than a
third.
	   The agreement is based on a stock swap that provides nine Total
Fina shares for two Petrofina shares. Total Fina will have a
controlling stake in 41 percent of Petrofina, which specializes in
refinery.
	   ``In refining-marketing, Total Fina will hold solid positions''
in the European Union. ``Joint management of the refineries and the
marketing networks should yield substantial productivity gains,''
the statement said.
	   A combined general meeting of shareholders has been called for
Jan. 14 to approve the agreement. Total said a public offering on
the remaining Petrofina shares will follow.
	   The move made Belgian investor Albert Frere, who controlled 30
percent of Petrofina shares, the biggest shareholder of Total Fina.
	   Petrofina stock has been gaining ground in recent days on rumors
that the company was in talks with France's Elf Aquitaine SA, Total
SA and Italy's ENI SpA.
	   Petrofina, which employs 15,000 people worldwide, is one of
Belgium's biggest industrial companies. It has interests in other
enterprises, including energy company Electrabel, utilities company
Tractebel SA, and holding companies Companie National a
Portefeuille, Sidro, Sofina SA, Groupe Bruxelles Lambert SA and
Electrafina SA.

Bowe, Webber share courtroom; Tyson up next

<TEXT>
	   UPPER MARLBORO, Maryland (AP) _ In the hallway outside the
courtrooom, Riddick Bowe and Chris Webber shook hands and wished
each other the best.
	   It would have been a sure double-take for any sports fan who
happened to be wandering down the second-floor hallway in the
Prince George's County Courthouse on Monday. But there they were,
two famous athletes, having to share a courthouse to answer
accusations of violence.
	   Webber, a Sacramento Kings forward, was about to stand trial on
charges of assaulting a police officer, resisting arrest,
possession of marijuana and several other offenses. The judge spent
the morning hearing a pretrial motion, but the start of the actual
trial was delayed because the same judge had to deal with Bowe, a
former heavyweight champion accused of assaulting his wife.
	   Bowe wasn't around very long. It only took Judge Hovey Johnson a
few minutes to shelve the second-degree assault charge from August
1997 on the conditions that Bowe have no violent conduct with his
wife and that he complete a 10-day psychiatric evaluation and any
accompanying treatments.
	   Then Bowe emerged and encountered Webber. The two shook hands
and exchanged a good-luck pats on the shoulder. Webber was
impeccably dressed in a gray suit; Bowe wore blue jeans and a dark
New York Yankees championship T-shirt, half tucked in.
	   As jury selection began in Webber's case, there were passing
references to his celebrity status. About 90 percent of the jury
pool said they had heard about the case, but only four said the
publicity would effect their judgement. One of the four, after
being dismissed, turned and said ``Good luck, Chris,'' before
leaving the courtroom.
	   The unusual Webber-Bowe docket didn't attract any sort of crowd.
Maybe they were waiting for Tuesday, when Webber's trial resumes
and another former champ, Mike Tyson, appears in court in
neighboring Montgomery County on charges he attacked two men after
a traffic accident in August.

<TEXT>
	   KUPANG, Indonesia (AP) _ Armed with knives, sickles and swords,
frightened Muslims on Tuesday guarded their homes and places of
worship in a provincial capital after Christian mobs went on a
rampage, burning or ransacking 15 mosques.
	   The attacks Monday in the city of Kupang came in apparent
retaliation for the burning of churches in Jakarta on Nov. 22,
escalating religious tensions in a nation already shaken by
economic and political turmoil.
	   ``I feel very sad and shocked,'' said Kamtina Ibrahim, a
26-year-old Muslim woman standing in front of the damaged main
mosque in the city of 120,000. Stone-throwing rioters had pushed
down the doors and shattered most of the windows.
	   Amid fears of a spree of tit-for-tat violence, Muslim mobs early
Tuesday burned two homes used for Christian worship as well as a
shop and a cinema in Banjarsari, 155 miles (250 kilometers)
southeast of Jakarta, the military said.
	   Social tensions in the Southeast Asian nation have intensified
as it grapples with its worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Thousands of people, many with knives and other weapons, blocked
roads in the Christian-dominated city of Kupang and gang fights
broke out. Troops patrolled in some parts of the capital of East
Nusa Tenggara province, 1,875 kilometers (1,172 miles) southeast of
Jakarta.
	   Many army reinforcements had rushed from the nearby territory of
East Timor, where separatist rebels have been fighting the
Indonesian military since 1975.
	   Police said they had detained alleged instigators of the riots,
the official Antara news agency reported. Authorities did not say
how many people were being questioned.
	   Skeptical of the military's vow to protect them, many Muslims in
Kupang patrolled in front of homes and mosques.
	   Indonesia is 90 percent Muslim and is the world's most populous
Islamic nation. However, some islands in the sprawling archipelago
have Christian majorities.
	   On Monday, mobs damaged or set afire 15 mosques after a protest
against church-burning by thousands of Christians degenerated into
a riot, said Muhammad Djaffar, chairman of the mosque council in
Kupang.
	   Crowds also burned down a market, a Muslim school and a hostel
for Islamic pilgrims. Several other small places of Islamic worship
as well as dozens of shops belonging to migrants from other islands
were also set on fire.
	   Djaffar criticized the security forces, saying they reacted
slowly to the unrest and showed little desire to confront the mobs.
There were no reports of arrests.
	   ``They seemed very calm while the rioters torched and pelted the
mosques with stones,'' Djaffar said. ``They didn't do anything to
stop the mobs.''
	   Four mosques were burned and 13 people were injured, said F.K.
Lerik, the Protestant mayor of Kupang. Air services to Kupang were
canceled because of security concerns.
	   The violence was seen as an act of revenge for the burning and
ransacking of 22 churches by Muslim mobs in Jakarta two weeks ago,
when 14 people were killed, some hacked to death.
	   Hoping to cool tensions, Kupang's Roman Catholic Bishop Petrus
Turang apologized for the burnings. Islamic leaders across the
nation of 202 million urged their followers not to retaliate with
more violence.
	   ``We condemn all burning of houses of God,'' President B.J.
Habibie said Tuesday. ``We condemn it whether it is the burning of
churches or mosques or Buddhist temples or whatever.''
	   Religious diversity based on a belief in God is enshrined in the
national philosophy, known as Pancasila, adopted when Indonesia
declared independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945.
	   The upsurge in religious violence follows months of riots and
protests in many parts of Indonesia. There is also political
turmoil as students protesters demand greater democracy after 32
years of authoritarian rule by former President Suharto, who was
forced to quit following deadly riots in May.

Philippine stock index falls 2.7 percent on Wall Street plunge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks plunged Tuesday as
investors cashed in on recent gains following Wall Street's large
drop overnight, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 53.57 points,
or 2.7 percent, to 1,921.79, nearly erasing Friday's 54.43-point,
or 2.8 percent, gain.
	   The market was closed Monday for a national holiday.
	   Traders said the market joined other regional bourses hard hit
by the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 2.3 percent decline Monday.
	   San Miguel B shares fell 4 pesos, or 5.8 percent, to 65 pesos
following a news report claiming that Filipino-Chinese tycoon Lucio
Tan has revived his bid to acquire the 20 percent stake held by San
Miguel chairman Eduardo Cojuangco Jr.
	   Fitzgerald Aklan, assistant vice president for institutional
sales of Orion-Squire Securities Inc., said the prospect of Tan
taking control of San Miguel may not have been welcomed by
investors.
	   Tan owns Asia Brewery Inc., the main beer rival of San Miguel.
He is also chairman of ailing Philippine Airlines Inc. and is
embroiled in a 26 billion peso (dlrs 658 million) tax evasion case.
	   Investors shrugged off a cut in the central bank's key overnight
rates and gains made by the peso against the dollar Tuesday,
traders said.
	   The central bank cut its overnight borrowing rate to 13.375
percent from 13.500 percent, and its overnight lending rate to
15.375 percent from 15.500 percent.
	   The overnight rates influence the direction of other interest
rates. Lower rates may cause a shift in funds from fixed-income
bonds to other types of investments such as stocks.
	   ``The correction was bound to happen since the market has been
strong in the past few days,'' said Aklan. ``The correction may
continue in the next session or two, but the market is bound to
move up soon after and remain strong toward the end of the year.''
	   Aklan said the index remained fairly buoyant Tuesday despite the
presence of profit-takers. He noted that any downturn in prices was
soon met with bargain-hunting, especially among second-tier stocks.
	   In currency trading, the peso strengthened against the U.S.
dollar, with strong dollar inflows overpowering the impact of the
interest rate cuts, traders said.
	   At midafternoon the dollar averaged 39.341 pesos, down from
Friday's average of 39.512 pesos.
	   Most of the dollar inflows were remittances from Filipinos
working overseas, traders said.
	   An estimated 4.5 million Filipinos work abroad, sending home
around dlrs 6 billion last year. Their foreign-exchange remittances
provide an important contribution to the Philippine economy, and
are expected to help support the peso over the rest of the year.

Chinese police detain dissidents in crackdown on illegal party

 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police have detained two of China's most
prominent dissidents and three other democracy campaigners in a
concerted crackdown apparently aimed at crushing a budding
opposition party.
	   Police in two cities descended on the homes of Xu Wenli, Qin
Yongmin and other members of the China Democracy Party on Monday
night and took them away, relatives and a human rights group said
Tuesday.
	   The police action was one of the harshest since dissidents
announced the formation of the would-be opposition group in June to
challenge the ruling Communist Party's monopoly on power. Since
then, police have questioned, briefly detained and harassed the
activists but refrained from filing charges.
	   Police on Tuesday informed the family of Qin Yongmin that he was
arrested for plotting to overthrow the government, the Hong
Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China said. The crime carries a maximum penalty of life
imprisonment.
	   In taking Xu Wenli from his home Monday night, police produced
an arrest warrant and a search warrant that identified him as a
criminal suspect, said his wife, He Xitong. Unlike previous
occasions when Xu was held only for short periods, she feared this
time authorities were planning to charge and convict him.
	   Twenty police officers ransacked their Beijing apartment,
seizing a computer, a fax machine, address books, video tapes, a
typewriter, more than 1,000 pages of documents and even a
telephone, she said.
	   ``Xu Wenli has already paid heavily for democracy. I understand
that he is ready to pay again,'' said his wife. ``Xu Wenli won't
give up.''
	   Qin and Xu are among the most influential figures in China's
fractured, persecuted dissident community. Their campaigning
started in the Democracy Wall protest movement of the late 1970s.
	   Xu spent 13 years of a 15-year sentence in jail, much of it in
solitary confinement, and was released in 1993. Qin was jailed for
several years in the 1980s and then again in 1994-95.
	   Aside from Qin, police in the central city of Wuhan also hauled
away two other members of the China Democracy Party, Chen Zhonghe
and Xiao Shichang, the Information Center said.
	   A fifth member of the party, Lai Jinbiao, also was detained
Monday afternoon in eastern Hangzhou city after making a speech in
a public park demanding the ruling Communist Party carry out
political reforms, the Information Center said.
	   Encouraged by China's recent signing of key U.N. human rights
treaties, dissidents in many parts of the country have since June
been trying to formally register the China Democracy Party.
	   Despite brief police detentions and almost constant
surveillance, Xu, Qin and other dissidents continued their efforts,
setting up local party branches, taking party oaths and nominating
people for party posts.
	   In their 3 and 1/2-hour search of Xu's apartment, the police
paid particular attention to documents related to the party and
made a careful record of each document they seized, his wife said.
Police also were watching the homes of other party members in
Beijing.
	   Given the possibility of arrest, Xu had already prepared a bag
containing clothes and washing gear that he took with him, his wife
said.

Tokyo stocks lower after collapse of mid-sized builder; dollar down
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with closing bond, late afternoon currency;
ADDS comments from government official in 7th graf

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks fell Tuesday as the collapse of a
mid-sized builder fanned fears about the country's debt-ridden
construction industry. The dollar dropped against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average slipped 48.29
points, or 0.32 percent, closing the day's trading at 14,835.41
points. On Monday, the Nikkei closed down 185.69 points, or 1.23
percent.
	   The U.S. dollar bought 122.78 yen, down 1.04 yen from late
Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 123.26
yen overnight.
	   In the biggest bankruptcy by a general contractor so far this
year, Tokyo-based JDC Corp. said it filed for court protection with
debts totaling 407 billion yen (dlrs 3.3 billion) from failed golf
course development and other projects.
	   JDC went under after banks cut its credit life lines, something
that traders said could happen to other struggling construction
companies as Japanese banks grapple with massive loads of bad loans
on their books.
	   A top government official said that more collapses were
inevitable as Japan cuts red tape and opens industries such as
construction and banking to greater competition.
	   ``General contractor bankruptcies and other phenomena will have
to continue for a while, won't they,'' Taichi Sakaiya, the
director-general of Japan's Economic Planning Agency, asked
rhetorically at a regular press conference.
	   That helped drive the Nikkei subindex of construction companies
down 1.1 percent. While shares in JDC were suspended, the day's
biggest decliner was another mid-sized contractor, Daisue
Construction Co., which saw its stock price plunge 14 percent.
	   An estimated 387 million shares traded on the first section of
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, down from Monday's 397 million. Declining
issues outnumbered gainers almost three to one.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 1.24 points, or 0.11 percent, to 1,142.26 points.
The TOPIX closed down 14.85 points, or 1.28 percent, the day
before.
	   In currency markets, the U.S. dollar fell following an overnight
decline on Wall Street, traders said.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9,116.55 on Monday,
down 216.53 points, or 2.3 percent.
	   ``The margin of fall in the Dow was quite big,'' said Yukihiko
Hashimoto, senior manager of the treasury and funding department of

Bush arrives on private visit to country that idolizes him
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Former U.S. President George Bush arrived in
Kuwait on Monday for a brief visit, his third to a country that
idolizes him as the hero of the 1991 Gulf War that ended a
seven-month Iraqi occupation of Kuwait.
	   Although Bush's visit is a private one, he was greeted at the
airport by the crown prince, Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah.
	   The former president planned to meet with U.S. Army troops
stationed at Camp Doha, north of Kuwait City. They maintain
equipment prepositioned here to be used to defend Kuwait against
any further Iraqi aggression.
	   Bush, who is accompanied by a group of investors, is to meet the
emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and attend a dinner with
Kuwaiti dignitaries and businessmen. He leaves early Wednesday.
	   Security is tight, and the press has been told it will have no
access to Bush during the visit.
	   When Bush first came to Kuwait in April 1993, authorities
uncovered a plot to assassinate him. Two Iraqis were sentenced to
death in connection with the plot, and several others were given
prison terms.
	   Bush earlier visited Egypt and Saudi Arabia.

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Doctors hope they can soon destroy some cancerous
breast tumors with lasers and high-tech imaging _ all without the
scars that can come with surgery.
	   The procedure, which amounts to a nonsurgical breast lumpectomy,
was studied on 15 patients in the past year. One of them was Lena
Hoffman, 81, of Little Rock, Arkansas. ``I cleaned house the next
morning,'' she said.
	   Researchers said the procedure would be for cancer detected in
the early and sometimes middle stages but not in advanced cases.
	   Steven Harms, professor of radiology and director of imaging
research at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in
Little Rock, was the lead researcher. He plans to present the
findings Friday at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society
of North America in Chicago.
	   ``It's early and more studies are necessary, but it is a very
promising alternative for women who want to avoid disfiguring
surgery,'' Harms said Monday. ``Because we don't make an incision,
there is no scar and virtually no evidence of surgery.''
	   Harms said the laser procedure can be done on an outpatient
basis and requires minimal recovery time compared with more
expensive and painful lumpectomies and mastectomies.
	   The patients involved in the study later underwent either a
mammogram or a lumpectomy. The laser-targeted cancerous tissue had
been destroyed in all cases, Harms said.
	   A specialized, interactive form of magnetic resonance imaging,
known as RODEO MR, allowed doctors to see the tumors as they
treated the patients.
	   Under the procedure, the doctor places a needle in the tumor and
then advances a fiber optic wire through it. The wire is used to
apply laser heat for about 10 minutes, a process called ablation.
The tumor is heated and destroyed.
	   A physician not involved in the research, Dr. David Kinne, said
the procedure sounded promising but was concerned with the small
number of patients involved and the short follow-up time.
	   Kinne, professor of surgery and chief of breast services at
Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York, also questioned
how accurate RODEO MR would be in determining a tumor's size and
other characteristics. And he wondered how doctors would determine
the need for subsequent treatment such as chemotherapy.
	   However, all that ``doesn't mean it doesn't need to be
explored,'' Kinne said.
	   Harms said doctors can tell from a biopsy what follow-up
treatment is needed and said the RODEO MR is ``extremely accurate''
in determining a tumor's size.
	   Hoffman was optimistic after her success with the procedure.
	   ``I think it will encourage young women to come in and have
their mammograms and their examinations if they have the assurance
of not destroying the breast,'' she said.

Death toll from strong Indonesian earthquake rises to 25

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES 5th graf with official on island confirming 25 dead,
at least eight missing; ADDS other details thruout
 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The death toll from a powerful
earthquake that hit a remote island in Indonesia rose to 25 on
Tuesday as rescue teams searched for more victims and survivors,
officials said.
	   The magnitude-6.5 quake hit Mangole island on Sunday night,
destroying buildings and houses and triggering landslides.
	   Strong aftershocks continued to rock the island Tuesday,
hampering rescue efforts and frightening villagers.
	   Initially six people were reported killed on the island, about
1,900 kilometers (1,180 miles) northeast of Indonesia's capital,
Jakarta.
	   Karim Samona, a local government official contacted by telephone
on Mangole, confirmed the toll jumped to 25 after reports were
received from isolated villages. At least eight were still missing,
he said.
	   ``Rescue teams are looking for more possible victims in remote
areas. The toll could rise further,'' Wahab Konoras, another
official, said in a telephone interview from Ternate, the capital
of North Maluku regency.
	   Officials denied unconfirmed reports that the toll had already
climbed above 30 dead.
	   Afraid that aftershocks might bring down their damaged homes,
about 7,000 people slept in tents or in the open.
	   ``People are still very scared,'' said Karim.
	   Widespread damage was also reported on neighboring Taliabu
island, but there were no reports of deaths there.
	   Local government officials said more than 150 people were
injured and more than 858 homes, churches, mosques and other
buildings were damaged on both islands. Mangole's main government
buildings were flattened.
	   Some houses slid into the sea. Roads were cut and bridges
destroyed, hampering search and rescue efforts.
	   Neither island has a major hospital. Karim said emergency
flights were taking seriously injured victims to neighboring
islands for urgent treatment.
	   Urgently needed food and medical supplies were expected to
arrive by ship on Wednesday from the neighboring Ambon island, he
said.
	   Five of the dead were killed when the roof of a timber factory
collapsed.
	   Others were killed when their houses fell down. Some were killed
by landslides.
	   One landslide destroyed Mangole's main shipping dock.
	   On Tuesday electricity supplies remained cut in many places and
telecommunications with both islands were patchy.
	   The quake struck at 10:10 p.m. local time Sunday and was
centered beneath the Maluku Sea, about 370 kilometers (230 miles)
south of the city of Manado on the island of Sulawesi, the
Meteorological and Geophysics Agency said.
	   Initially, the U.S. Geological Survey estimated the quake had a
magnitude of 7.6, but this was later revised down to 6.5 by the
Indonesian agency.
	   Mangole and Taliabu are part of the Maluku archipelago, known in
colonial times as the Spice Islands.
	   Earthquakes are common in Indonesia, which lies astride the
so-called Pacific ``Ring of Fire'' _ a line of volcanically active
areas that stretches from Central America and the western coast of
North America across to Japan, Southeast Asia, the South Pacific
and New Zealand.

Indonesian president urges restraint following church and
</HEADLINE>
mosque-burning
 &UR; With Indonesia-Religious Tension

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Indonesian President B.J. Habibie on
Tuesday condemned religious attacks and urged restraint in the wake
of mob rampages that have left churches and mosques in ruins in the
Southeast Asian nation.
	   ``We condemn all burning of houses of God,'' Habibie said at the
opening of a human rights workshop at the state palace. ``We
condemn it whether it is the burning of churches or mosques or
Buddhist temples or whatever.''
	   On Monday, Christian crowds in the provincial capital of Kupang
burned or ransacked 15 mosques as well as a Muslim school and a
hostel for Islamic pilgrims.
	   The violence apparently came in retaliation for the burning and
ransacking of 22 churches by Muslim mobs in Jakarta on Nov. 22,
when 14 people were killed, some hacked to death.
	   Habibie, who is already beset by economic and political turmoil,
said the attacks violated the values of Indonesian culture.
	   Religious diversity based on a belief in God is enshrined in the
national philosophy, known as Pancasila, adopted when Indonesia
declared independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945.
	   ``We will not tolerate any kind of discrimination against ethnic
groups, religious discrimination or racial discrimination,''
Habibie said. ``You should know that this is a basic principle of
daily life.
	   ``Indonesia is not a secular state, but also we are not a state
based on one religion,'' he said. ``We are a state reflecting the
society based on a variety of religions.''
	   State Secretary Akbar Tanjung pledged that the government would
help rebuild ruined churches and mosques.
	   Indonesia is the world's most populous Islamic nation. About 90
percent of its 202 million people are Muslims, with the rest
following Christian, Hindu, Buddhist or other faiths.

Kremlin says Yeltsin improving, still in hospital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin is feeling better, but is
still spending part of the day in bed as he continues to be treated
for pneumonia, officials said Tuesday.
	   A Kremlin spokesman said the president was doing limited
paperwork and there were no plans for any meetings or visitors. He
did not say how much longer Yeltsin would remain in the government
hospital where he has been for 10 days.
	   Yeltsin met his chief-of-staff Valentin Yumashev in the hospital
Monday and was briefed on government and national affairs.
	   Russian television showed brief footage of Yeltsin, dressed in a
white shirt and dark cardigan and looking pale, listening intently
to his aide and nodding periodically. Like most footage of Yeltsin
released in recent weeks, Monday's tape didn't contain any sound of
the president speaking.
	   Yeltsin's repeated illnesses and his infrequent public
appearances have raised concerns about his ability to lead the
country _ now mired in its worst economic crisis since the 1991
Soviet collapse _ through the end of his term in mid-2000.

Sudanese rebels repulse government attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Sudanese rebels said Tuesday they fought
off a four-pronged government attack in the Nuba Mountains in
western central Sudan.
	   Government ground forces attacked the region on Nov. 11 and were
finally driven out on Nov. 23, said Martin Okerruk, spokesman for
the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army in Nairobi.
	   Sudanese opposition radio said SPLA troops killed 42 government
soldiers, wounded many others and took four prisoners. Two rebel
soldiers were killed and eight wounded, it said.
	   Okerruk said he could not confirm the casualty figures because
he was still waiting for details from the field.
	   Animist and Christian rebels in southern Sudan have fought a
15-year insurgency for autonomy from the Arab, Muslim-dominated
government in the north. More than 1.5 million Sudanese have died
in the fighting and consequent famines.

Moscow denies fomenting strife between Uzbekistan and Tajikistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government on Tuesday dismissed
allegations that its secret services provoked a recent
confrontation between Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, two ex-Soviet
republics in Central Asia.
	   ``Any claims about the Russian secret services involvement in
the exacerbation of the Uzbek-Tajik relations are absolutely
groundless,'' the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement.
	   Uzbek President Islam Karimov on Monday accused the Russian
Federal Security Service (FSB), the main successor of the KGB, of
provoking a recent dispute between his nation and neighboring
Tajikistan.
	   The dispute centered on an anti-government rebellion last month
in Tajikistan, which was put down after several days of fierce
fighting that claimed 334 lives.
	   Tajik authorities accused Uzbekistan of helping train the
rebels, commanded by former Col. Makhmud Khudoberdyev, and
harboring them after their defeat. Uzbekistan has angrily denied
the claims.
	   Karimov claimed an FSB officer, an ethnic Tajik, fomented the
uprising. The FSB acknowledged the officer, Rizo Tursunov, is an
agent, but said he had no role in the incident.
	   Tajikistan, an impoverished nation reeling from several years of
civil war, has been plagued by frequent clashes despite a peace
deal signed last year by the Russian-backed hardline government and
the mostly Islamic opposition.
	   ``Our efforts are aimed at consistent support of national
reconciliation and ensuring peace process in Tajikistan,'' the
Russian foreign ministry said. ``Russia isn't pursuing any other
interests in the region.''

Italian police detain 26 people suspected of smuggling immigrants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Police on Tuesday detained 26 people suspected of
smuggling would-be immigrants and drugs across the Mediterranean
from Albania.
	   Italian news reports said the suspects included Italians and
Albanians. Several of the arrested own shipyards along Italy's
southern coast and allegedly provided smugglers with powerful boats
with secret compartments to transport drugs.
	   The government is attempting to crack down on the illegal
trafficking of people and drugs by heavily patrolling Italy's long
coastline. But dinghies filled with would-be immigrants continue to
arrive almost on a daily basis.
	   Most are Kurds, ethnic Albanian Kosovo refugees or northern
Africans fleeing persecution or war at home. They usually pay
smugglers huge fees for the voyage but are often left stranded
several kilometers off the coast and many die trying to swim
ashore.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A medium-sized Japanese general contractor went
bankrupt Tuesday with debts totaling 406.7 billion yen (dlrs 3.3
billion) from failed golf course and other projects.
	   JDC Corp. filed for protection with the Tokyo District Court
Tuesday morning, company spokeswoman Yumiko Fukahori said.
	   It was the largest bankruptcy of a Japanese general contractor
since Tokai Kogyo Co. went bust in July last year after amassing
debts of 511 billion yen (dlrs 4.2 billion), according to Teikoku
Data Bank, a Tokyo think tank.
	   Trading in JDC shares, listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's
first section, was suspended Tuesday, following Japanese news
reports on the company's troubles, the exchange said.
	   JDC said its finances deteriorated when Japan's real-estate
business took a downturn in the early 1990s.
	   Founded in 1951 originally as a machinery leasing firm, the
Tokyo-based company heavily invested in golf courses and other
development projects from the 1980s.
	   The company posted 294.2 billion yen (dlrs 2.41 billion) in
sales in the latest fiscal year ending in March, down 7.2 percent
from a year before. It employs 1,725 workers.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prosecutors arrested the chairman of Fuji Heavy
Industries on Tuesday on suspicion of bribing a legislator for help
in obtaining a defense contract, Japanese media reports said.
	   Fuji Heavy Chairman Isamu Kawai, 70, was arrested after
prosecutors raided the company's headquarters to search for
evidence, Kyodo News reported.
	   Kawai and other top executives allegedly asked Yojiro Nakajima,
who has been arrested on separate charges, for help in obtaining a
contract to develop an amphibious airplane for Japan's Marine
Self-Defense Forces.
	   The executives are suspected of bribing Nakajima while he was a
vice defense minister.
	   Prosecutors and company officials would not confirm the arrest.
	   Last week, prosecutors arrested Yasuyuki Kogure, 64, a former
Fuji Heavy executive director, on charges of giving 5 million yen
(dlrs 41,000) in kickbacks to Nakajima.
	   Nakajima, 39, a Liberal Democratic Party member of Parliament,
was arrested last month on charges of ordering false receipts made
to account for missing party money. The arrest was unrelated to the
Fuji Heavy Industries case.
	   Fuji Heavy Industries, maker of Subaru automobiles, has said it
donated 4 million yen (dlrs 33,000) to Nakajima since 1993, and
bought 740,000 yen (dlrs 6,115) worth of tickets for fund-raising
parties for the lawmaker.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. and John
Fairfax Holdings apparently raised about 60 million Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 38 million) by selling shares in telephone
carrier AAPT, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The share followed Fairfax's sale of Australian Geographic
magazine Monday to a venture capital backed management team for
47.2 million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 29.7 million), the
Sydney Morning Herald reported.
	   Stockbroker Macquarie Equities was understood to be selling
about 42 million AAPT shares, representing about 16 percent of the
issued capital, to institutional investors.
	   AAPT's largest shareholder, AAP Information Services, was seen
behind the sale. Its chief executive, Lee Casey, had no comment.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Political unreast and a rising crime
rate have worsened a retail slump in Indonesia, according to the
Indonesian Retailers' Association.
	   The increasingly uncertain situation on Jakarta's streets has
resulted in many people leaving work earlier and reduced the
likelihood of night shopping, once a favorite pastime among
affluent Jakarta residents.
	   ``I think some of the retailers also feel very much that their
volumes will go down,'' association chairman Steve Sondakh told Dow
Jones Newswires in an interview released Tuesday.
	   ``They are naturally going to shorten their operating hours,''
said Sondahk, who is also a direct of the Hero supermarket chain,
one of Indonesia's biggest retail groups.
	   Consumer activity has already been hit by a deep recession
caused by Indonesia's worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Sondakh said retail sales on average have already fallen between
30 percent and 40 percent from a year ago, with the electronics
sector being the hardest hit. Sales there are down an estimated 60
percent.
	   Lawlessness has been on the rise since political unrest that
forced the outster of President Suharto earlier this year. Crime
has gotten so bad in Jakarta that several foreign embassies are
advising their citizens to avoid the city of 11 million altogether.
	    &UR; _____
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Stable food prices and a return to
moderate weather are expected to have slightly eased inflationary
pressures in the Philippines in November, analysts said Tuesday.
	   Economists said they expect inflation in November to register
10.1 percent year-on-year, down from 10.2 percent in October. The
data is due for release either Friday or Monday.
	   In the nine months to October, inflation averaged 9.5 percent,
lower than the government's 10 percent target for 1998 and within
most economists' projection of a single-digit average for the year.
	   Inflation hit double-digits in May for the first time in two
years, reaching 10.1 percent.
	   Food prices, which account for 55 percent of the consumer price
index, had been boosted by weather disturbances throughout the
year. A drought attributed to the El Nino weather phenomenon caused
food prices to peak in June and July.
	   The onset of rains in September improved agricultural
production, but a series of typhoons in October placed pressure on
the food supply, resulting still higher prices.
	   With the absence of heavy rains in November and the government's
continued importation of basic necessities such as unmilled rice,
sugar and corn, consumer prices are expected to have inched lower.

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ With two struggling teams facing each other, the
winner needed a little luck.
	   Montreal center Saku Koivu was credited with the game's opening
goal, at the 6:17 mark of the second period. But it was Los Angeles
defenseman Sean O'Donnell who actually steered Koivu's rebound into
his own net.
	   That started the Canadiens to a 3-1 victory Monday night as
Montreal snapped a three-game losing streak.
	   ``They needed a break _ they're struggling _ and they got it,''
O'Donnell said. ``It just continues for us.''
	   It was the only NHL game played Monday.
	   Los Angeles (6-14-3) has only managed to accumulate five points
(two wins and a tie) in its last 14 games and has lost eight of its
last nine.
	   Despite sliding face down toward the net, Koivu managed to
direct a shot towards the Kings' goal that seemed to catch Los
Angeles goalie Stephane Fiset by surprise. Fiset made a toe save,
but O'Donnell's stick directed the puck into the open side to
Fiset's left.
	   ``I made the save and Sean O'Donnell tried just to put the puck
in the corner, but it hit his stick and went right in,'' Fiset
said. ``It's getting frustrating for us because we aren't getting
any of the bounces.''

Two of 10 Laotian Christians released from Vientiane jail
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Single name Khammieng in 6th-7th grafs is correct.
 &UR; By GRANT PECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Two Christians who were arrested at a
prayer meeting in the capital of Laos have been released after
spending 10 months in jail, the U.S.-based missionary group with
which they are affiliated announced Tuesday.
	   Eight other Laotians arrested at the meeting remain in prison
after having been convicted of engaging in antisocial activities, a
spokesman for the Little Rock, Arkansas-based group Partners in
Progress said by e-mail.
	   The 13 were among 44 people arrested Jan. 30 at a private
residence in Vientiane, the capital of the Southeast Asian nation.
	   Those originally arrested included three U.S. citizens, a French
woman and a Thai preacher, all of whom were released and expelled
after being held for four nights.
	   Twenty-six Laotians were also released without being charged
with any crime. Three elderly women who were convicted were
released after serving two months in prison.
	   Partners in Progress spokesman Jerry Canfield identified the two
persons released from That Dom prison late last week as Miss
Duangmanee Yilatchay, 20, and Khammieng, also 20.
	   Duangmanee was the last female among the Christians still being
held. Canfield speculated that she received a longer jail term than
the other women because she had taught Bible classes to the
children of the congregation. Khammieng is a farmer from a village
several miles (kilometers) outside the capital.
	   Both had been given one-year sentences which were reduced to ten
months by the Lao Supreme Court, said Canfield, who expressed
pleasure they had been released several days earlier than expected.
	   The eight remaining prisoners had originally been given
three-year sentences, and the Supreme Court reduced the jail terms
of seven of them to two years, and that of the eighth to
two-and-a-half years, he said.
	   Partners in Progress is a humanitarian evangelical organization
based in Little Rock, Arkansas, with activities worldwide. It is
affiliated with the Churches of Christ.
	   The group has been working in Laos since 1993, providing medical
aid, assistance in sanitation and clean water supplies for rural
schools and English-language instruction for medical personnel.
	   The arrests drew concern from international human rights groups
and the U.S. Embassy, which regarded the detentions as an
infringement of religious freedom.
	   The case has been an irritant in U.S.-Lao relations, and some
diplomats believe it may have kept Laos from being granted
most-favored nation trading status by Washington.
	   In February, in the only extended public comment on the case so
far from the Laotian government, the official Laotian news agency
KPL published what was described as a clarification of the case by
the Foreign Ministry.
	   The statement said the prayer meeting breached a law providing
that ``an individual who organizes or takes part in a meeting to
create social turmoil will be sentenced to one to five years
imprisonment.''
	   It also cited a constitutional ban on ``all acts of religious
discrimination and all acts to cleave a wedge among people.''
	   It said that ``both foreign and Lao nationals who took part in
the meeting made use of religious practice as a pretext for their
propaganda activity. However, the gathering was to slander the Lao
leaders.''
	   The annual human rights report of the U.S. State Department this
year said Laos' constitution allows religious freedom but ``in
practice, the government continues to restrict freedom of religion,
especially for some Christian denominations.''

Most Asian shares lower, Hong Kong plummets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with closing figures for Tokyo, Hong Kong;
ADDS analyst comments.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets were sharply lower
Tuesday, following Wall Street's decline, with Hong Kong prices
diving for the third straight day.
	   Hong Kong's blue chip Hang Seng Index plummeted 4.1 percent as
the market digested a host of negative economic data as well as
Monday's 2.3 percent fall by the Dow Jones industrial average in
New York.
	   The Hang Seng closed below the psychologically important level
of 10,000 points to end at 9,975.85, down 426.47 points.
	   Traders are worried about Hong Kong's economy, which is
struggling through recession, said Michael Ng, dealing director at
Sassoon Securities.
	   Hong Kong's gross domestic product fell by 7 percent in the
third quarter, prompting the government to lower its economic
forecast a 5 percent contraction for 1998. Since that gloomy news
was announced Friday, the market has shed 7.1 percent.
	   Late Monday, the government reported its budget deficit for the
first seven months of the fiscal year had reached 50.16 billion
Hong Kong dollar (U.S. dlrs 6.43 billion), well above the 21
billion Hong Kong dollar (dlrs 2.69 billion) deficit the government
estimated for the fiscal year that ends March 31.
	   Market participants also said the Hang Seng index's plunge was a
natural correction as investors cashed in after sharp gains over
the past two months.
	   In Tokyo, the Nikkei average of 225 selected issues fell 48.29
points, or 0.3 percent, to 14,835.41 after a 185.69-point fall
Monday.
	   Traders said the market reacted mildly to Wall Street's drop and
news that JDC, a financially troubled contractor, had filed for
legal protection from creditors.
	   ``Despite JDC's failure and the overnight drop in New York, the
market showed some resilience,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general
manager of the stock division at Chuo Securities.
	   Singapore share prices were sharply lower before the close, with
the benchmark Straits Times Index down 43.82 points, or 3.1
percent, at 1,372.73.
	   Other Asian markets were also lower.

Placido Domingo may film newly restored 'Tales of Hoffmann'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos WX101, WX102 &QL; 
 &UR; By CARL HARTMAN &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Placido Domingo wants to film a favorite
century-old French opera _ ``The Tales of Hoffmann _ based on the
composer's original music, which has been newly brought to light by
an American musical sleuth.
	   ``I don't know if I'll sing 'Hoffmann' any more,'' said Domingo,
who has played the role nearly 100 times. He said his next job
probably would be to conduct the work. He is musical director of
the Washington Opera as well as its star, and recently took on the
additional job of artistic director at the Los Angeles Opera.
	   But he doesn't want to abandon the Hoffmann role, one of his
favorites.
	   ``Maybe I'll do it,'' he said, ``because there's a possibility,
a strong possibility, of doing it like I did with 'Tosca' on the
original locations.'' Singing in a film can be less wearing than a
live performance because it's done in bits and pieces.
	   Domingo starred in a film of the opera ``Tosca'' by Giacomo
Puccini, against the background of the tourist sites in Rome where
the story takes place. ``The Tales of Hoffmann'' has scenes in
German cities and climaxes with a wild party in a palazzo on a
canal in Venice.
	   Five years ago, Michael Kaye of Chevy Chase, Maryland,
discovered 144 measures from the climactic fourth act of
``Hoffman'' in the handwriting of composer Jacques Offenbach. A
French collection owns the manuscript.
	   ``It's got Offenbach's initials and the date, just 10 days
before he died,'' Kaye said.
	   Last summer, Kaye finally got permission to use the music, after
12 years spent cobbling together improved versions from hundreds of
pages of the composer's notes, culled from European archives.
	   The new music will get its world premiere on Jan. 24 at the
Hamburg State Opera in Germany.
	   Offenbach had done over 100 frothy musicals that suited the
taste of Paris in the mid-1800s. But his last, most ambitious work
_ ``The Tales of Hoffmann'' _ has become one of the world's most
popular operas.
	   Offenbach died, however, while the first production was being
rehearsed, and numerous changes were made over the years in both
the musical score and the text.
	   ``The Tales of Hoffmann'' is based on three fantastic tales by
E.T.A. Hoffmann, an influential German novelist of the early 1800s.
In the opera, the climactic scene of the standard version has
Hoffmann's love, Giulietta, floating off in a gondola with a rival.
	   In recent years, Kaye has helped restore the text, which critics
complained made no sense at many points. The new text was used in a
production by the New York City Opera last spring: Hoffmann,
blinded by magic, tries to stab Giulietta but kills his rival
instead. The gondolas belong to guests at a party in her apartment.
	   But at that point, the original music for the scene was still
not available.
	   Among the many changes in the music over the years, adapters had
given the melody of the famous Barcarolle _ heard in the popular
Italian film ``Life Is Beautiful' _ to the cellos. Kaye has put
back the oboe, clarinet and piccolo parts that Offenbach wrote,
perhaps to recall light glistening on the canals.
	   The newly available music includes the composer's own
instrumentation, the singers' parts and a piano version. Offenbach
wrote the piano version first, filling in the parts for the voices
and instruments later.
	   Kaye, 50, spent 10 years writing ``The Unknown Puccini,'' which
compiles songs that Puccini _ composer of ``Tosca,'' ``La Boheme''
and ``Madame Butterfly'' _ wrote in addition to his stage music.
His next project: preparing the American premiere of Ottarino
Respighi's opera, ``Sleeping Beauty.''

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Two of Europe's largest drug makers, Hoechst of
Germany and Rhone-Poulenc of France, announced Tuesday they are
merging their pharmaceutical and agrochemical operations.
	   The new company will be called Aventis, said a statement
released by the two companies. It is to be based in Strasbourg,
eastern France, where a press conference was to be held later
Tuesday.
	   The agreement ``launches the procedure for the first phase of a
two-step plan which will eventually lead to a full merger of
Hoechst and Rhone Poulenc,'' the statement said.
	   ``We want to create a new company, with European roots and
global reach, to take full advantage of the extensive opportunities
of life sciences in the 21st century,'' said the two chairmen,
Jean-Rene Fourtu of Rhone Poulenc and Jurgen Dormann of Hoechst.
	   It was ``anticipated'' that Dormann would be the new chairman of
Aventis, and Fourtu the vice chairman, the statement said.
	   Analysts have warned against a full merger until the heavily
indebted firms reduce costs.
	   With annual sales of around dlrs 20 billion, the new company
will be tied for the No. 1 ranking with Switzerland's Novartis in
the life-sciences sector.
	   Unions in France and Germany have been critical of the merger,
fearing layoffs. Hoechst employs 118,000 workers and Rhone-Poulenc,
68,000.

Key witness says he tried to win favors from Anwar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with details.
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A key police witness in the Anwar
Ibrahim trial told the court Tuesday that he had failed to win
business favors from the ex-deputy prime minister, but denied that
led him to testify against the defendant.
	   The former police intelligence officer, Amir Junos, faced
questioning from defense attorneys about whether he was biased
against Anwar because his request for favors had been denied.
	   Earlier, the witness had admitted during cross-examination that
he had asked Anwar for equity in a securities firm and business
deals for his friends.
	   ``I was not given anything. I merely tried to express my feeling
to get a portion of the equity but I did not get anything,'' Amir
told the court.
	   Defense lawyer Christopher Fernando suggested Amir might bear a
grudge after having failed to get the equity stake in the
brokerage. ``I do not have such intentions,'' Amir replied.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, two weeks after he was fired as
Malaysia's deputy prime minister and finance minister. His
subsequent jailing and beating while in custody have attracted
international concern over the case.
	   Anwar is being tried on four counts of corruption. He will be
tried on another corruption count, as well as five counts of sexual
misconduct, at a later date.
	   The former deputy premier denies the charges, calling them part
of political vendetta orchestrated by his former mentor, Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Amir was called as a witness by the prosecution to prove
allegations that Anwar had directed the police to harass and
intimidate two people who had alleged that Anwar had sex with his
secretary's wife and had sodomized his chauffeur.
	   The case has been buffeted by raucous proceedings, including the
sentencing on Monday of one of the defense lawyers to three months
in jail for contempt of court. The action against defense lawyer
Zainur Zakaria interrupted the main trial when the defense team
asked for an adjournment to recover from the blow.
	   Judge Augustine Paul handed down the sentence Monday after
Zainur refused to apologize for an affidavit he had filed on behalf
of Anwar seeking the removal of two prosecutors on grounds that
they were allegedly fabricating evidence.
	   The lawyer, who won a reprieve from a higher court that stayed
his imprisonment pending an appeal hearing this coming Friday, was
present in the court Tuesday.
	   During his testimony Tuesday, witness Amir also denied warning
Anwar about ``political enemies'' or telling the former No. 2 in
the government that his phone had been tapped since 1992.

Media center opening postponed as Asian Games embarrassments mount
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By THAKSINA KHAIKAEW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Inauguration of the main media center
for the 13th Asian Games was postponed Tuesday because the
facilities weren't ready, the latest blow to the hopes of host
country Thailand that everything will run smoothly.
	   Five days before Asia's biggest sporting competition officially
opens, bugs are turning up _ literally _ in a last-minute frenzy to
put the finishing touches on venues and, in some cases, make them
usable.
	   The Bangkok Post highlighted problems both about the poor soccer
pitch at the National Stadium where the main matches will be played
and the central swimming pool's tendency to fill up with dead
insects.
	   Taiwan's riding team at the equestrian center, meanwhile, blamed
poor arena conditions for injuries to a prize horse. And a surprise
rainstorm threatened to soak Tuesday's final rehearsal for the
opening ceremonies.
	   Nearly 5,000 journalists have been accredited to cover the
games, which will bring together some 6,000 athletes from 41
countries in what the organizers have billed as the 20th century's
last great sporting event.
	   But the organization and construction of the venues has been
plagued by the Asian economic crisis.
	   The main media center, already a week behind schedule for its
inauguration, saw the official opening postponed again Tuesday when
Jurin Laksanavisit, a government minister, didn't show because the
facilities weren't ready.
	   ``I'm still trying to get the center officially opened today,''
said Santiparb Tejavanija, deputy secretary general of the Bangkok
Asian Games Organizing Committee. ``It's already behind schedule.
Now, they want to postpone until Dec. 3. That will be too late.''
	   The pitch at the Bangkok's National Stadium, where Oman
demolished Hong Kong 6-0 in Monday's preliminary soccer matches
which unofficially kicked off the competition, is far below the
required international standard, the Bangkok Post cited Asia's top
soccer official as saying.
	   Dato Peter Velappan, secretary general of the Asian Football
Confederation, said that the pitch needed to be upgraded
immediately or another ground would have to be found for remaining
matches.
	   Velappan said he had warned Thailand six months ago that the
pitch was not good enough. Attempts to improve it made matters
worse because the contractor who laid new turf had more experience
with home gardens than soccer grounds, the Post said.
	   Just days ago, parts of the pitch were covered in water and bare
patches were showing.
	   Meanwhile, the head of the Swimming Association of Thailand was
quoted in the same newspaper as saying that thousands of dead
insects of all kinds have been found floating in the central
competition pool.
	   ``For Thai men, it might not be a serious problem but I am sure
it would make the foreigners' hair stand on end,'' Maj. Gen. Kamol
Saen-issara said.
	   Games officials, with the help of the Public Health Department,
have tried to solve the problem to no avail. Kamol said organizers
might have to turn to strong insecticides, but vowed not to use any
substances that could harm swimmers.
	   Kamol said he hoped that when the pool is in use, the increased
presence of humans might keep the bugs away. But since they tend to
come at night, attracted from swampy nearby fields to the bright
lights, more help might be needed.

 &UR; SAfrican Cabinet minister seeks amnesty for black struggle violence
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with hearing beginning, minister's testimony; no
pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ A Cabinet minister in President
Nelson Mandela's government on Tuesday told a human rights panel
how he organized vigilante groups to protect supporters of the
African National Congress.
	   But Jeff Radebe, minister of public works, told the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission that he had little control over the
groups' actions once they were armed.
	   More than 5,000 people died in clashes between the so-called
self-defense units and Zulu nationalists of the Inkatha Freedom
Party Zulu in the several years before 1994 elections ended
apartheid.
	   Radebe is seeking amnesty for his role in organizing the units,
which mainly operated in KwaZulu-Natal from 1990-1994. He is the
first ANC Cabinet minister to appear at a public amnesty hearing.
	   ``This place was in flames. Almost every Saturday I used to bury
comrades,'' Radebe said.
	   Radebe claimed in his amnesty application that no one died as a
result of his actions.
	   Local ANC supporters of the minister greeted him as he entered
the hearing room, and snickered at questions posed by a lawyer for
the Inkatha party.
	   Radebe's amnesty hearing was held in Durban, the major city of
KwaZulu-Natal, which is located on the Indian Ocean.
	   A number of top-ranking ANC government officials, including
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and Justice Minister Dullah Omar,
applied for amnesty in a last-minute submission before the deadline
last year.
	   They were among 37 ANC officials who were granted blanket
amnesty by the committee last year.
	   The amnesty was withdrawn after a court challenge by the
opposition National Party claiming the decision violated the
requirement that applicants name specific crimes.
	   The officials had claimed only broad political responsibility
for actions taken during the anti-apartheid struggle.
	   It is not clear when or if their amnesty applications will be
heard.
	   Radebe applied for amnesty separately from the 37 officials.
	   The Truth Commission in October released a report assigning
major blame for human rights violations to the National Party,
apartheid's architect. But it also cited the ANC for excesses.
	   The commission has the power to grant amnesty to those who
confess to specific crimes and can demonstrate a political motive _
a process expected to last well into next year as decisions are
made on over 7,000 amnesty applications.

Christian mobs burn two houses in Indonesian provincial capital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with burning by mobs in Kupang, military
reporting calm by afternoon.
 &UR; By SAM MARTINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUPANG, Indonesia (AP) _ Christian mobs burned two houses, a car
and a motorcycle Tuesday on the second day of unrest in a
provincial capital of Indonesia where rioters had already burned
and ransacked 15 mosques.
	   In a separate outburst of religious violence, Muslim crowds set
afire two homes used for Christian worship as well as a shop and a
cinema on Java, Indonesia's main island.
	   The riots raised fears that tit-for-tat attacks on places of
worship will escalate in the world's most populous Muslim nation,
which is already enduring severe economic and political turmoil.
	   ``We condemn all burning of houses of God,'' President B.J.
Habibie said Tuesday. ``We condemn it whether it is the burning of
churches or mosques or Buddhist temples or whatever.''
	   On Tuesday, frightened Muslims with sickles and swords guarded
their homes and mosques in the Christian-dominated city of Kupang,
the capital of East Nusa Tenggara province.
	   Thousands of people, many of them armed, roamed the streets and
attacked several buildings. However, heavy rain doused fires set by
arsonists and the military reported calm by the afternoon.
	   ``I feel very sad and shocked,'' said Kamtina Ibrahim, a
26-year-old Muslim woman standing in front of the main mosque in
the city of 120,000. Stone-throwing rioters had pushed down the
doors and shattered most of the windows.
	   The attacks on Kupang's mosques on Monday were in retaliation
for the burning and ransacking of 22 churches by Muslim mobs in
Jakarta on Nov. 22, when 14 people were killed, some hacked to
death.
	   In apparent revenge, two private houses where Christians
worshipped were set afire early Tuesday in Banjarsari, 155 miles
(250 kilometers) southeast of Jakarta, the military said.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslims,
with the rest following Christian, Hindu, Buddhist or other faiths.
Some cities in the sprawling archipelago nation have Christian
majorities.
	   Many army reinforcements had rushed to Kupang from the nearby
territory of East Timor, where separatist rebels have been fighting
the Indonesian military since 1975.
	   Police said they had detained alleged instigators of the riots,
the official Antara news agency reported. Authorities did not say
how many people were being questioned.
	   Muhammad Djaffar, chairman of the local mosque council, said 15
mosques were burned or vandalized Monday in Kupang, 1,875
kilometers (1,172 miles) southeast of Jakarta.
	   Crowds also burned down a market, a Muslim school and a hostel
for Islamic pilgrims. Several other small places of Islamic worship
as well as dozens of shops belonging to migrants from other islands
were also set on fire.
	   Djaffar criticized the security forces, saying they reacted
slowly to the unrest and showed little desire to confront the mobs.
There were no reports of arrests.
	   ``They seemed very calm while the rioters torched and pelted the
mosques with stones,'' Djaffar said.
	   The military, its credibility sagging because of its involvement
in alleged human rights abuses, has been overstretched as it tries
to keep order in the turbulent Southeast Asian nation.
	   Four mosques were burned and 13 people were injured, said F.K.
Lerik, the Protestant mayor of Kupang. Air services to Kupang were
canceled Tuesday because of security concerns.
	   Hoping to cool tensions, Kupang's Roman Catholic Bishop Petrus
Turang apologized for the burnings. Islamic leaders across the
nation urged their followers not to retaliate with more violence.
	   Religious diversity based on a belief in God is enshrined in the
national philosophy, known as Pancasila, adopted when Indonesia
declared independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945.
	   The upsurge in religious violence follows months of riots and
protests in many parts of Indonesia.
	   Social tensions in Indonesia, fueled by widespread unemployment,
have intensified amid the worst economic crisis in decades.
	   There is also political turmoil as students protesters demand
greater democracy after 32 years of authoritarian rule by former
President Suharto, who was forced to quit following deadly riots in
May.

Share prices tumble in Hong Kong after drop on Wall Street
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - Share prices in Hong Kong tumbled Tuesday, with
the key index losing 4.1 percent on the back of an overnight drop
in stock prices on Wall Street.
	   The blue chip Hang Seng Index fell 426.47 points to close at
9,975.85. On Monday, the index had shed 339.79 points.
	   Turnover rose to 6.50 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 833
million), up from Monday's 5.08 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 651 million).
	   Share prices fell in reaction to Wall Street's drop and concerns
about Hong Kong's economy, said Michael Ng, dealing director at
Sassoon Securities.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which touched a record high a
week ago, fell 216.53 points, or 2.3 percent, to end at 9,116.55
Monday.
	   Hong Kong's economy shrank by 7 percent in the third quarter,
prompting the government to lower its economic forecast a 5 percent
contraction for 1998.
	   On Monday, the government also announced that its budget deficit
for the first seven months of the fiscal year had reached 50.16
billion Hong Kong dollar (U.S. dlrs 6.43 billion).
	   That figure was well above the 21 billion Hong Kong dollar (dlrs
2.69 billion) deficit the government estimated for the fiscal year
that ends March 31, 1999.
	   Among big property stocks, Cheung Kong fell 4.25 Hong Kong
dollars to 51.50, and Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 2.75 dollars to
52.75.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings fell 9.00 dollars to
189.50, and Hang Seng Bank fell 3.25 dollars to 65.00.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa fell 2.75 dollars to 52.50, and
Swire Pacific ``A'' fell 1.70 dollars to 33.40.

Philippine stock index falls 2.7 percent on Wall Street plunge

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with peso closing higher

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks plunged Tuesday as
investors cashed in on recent gains following Wall Street's large
drop overnight, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 53.57 points,
or 2.7 percent, to 1,921.79, nearly erasing Friday's 54.43-point,
or 2.8 percent, gain.
	   The market was closed Monday for a national holiday.
	   Traders said the market joined other regional bourses hard hit
by the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 2.3 percent decline Monday.
	   San Miguel B shares fell 4 pesos, or 5.8 percent, to 65 pesos
following a news report claiming that Filipino-Chinese tycoon Lucio
Tan has revived his bid to acquire the 20 percent stake held by San
Miguel chairman Eduardo Cojuangco Jr.
	   Fitzgerald Aklan, assistant vice president for institutional
sales of Orion-Squire Securities Inc., said the prospect of Tan
taking control of San Miguel, the Philippines' largest food and
beverage conglomerate, may not have been welcomed by investors.
	   Tan owns Asia Brewery Inc., the main beer rival of San Miguel.
He is also chairman of ailing Philippine Airlines Inc. and is
embroiled in a 26 billion peso (dlrs 658 million) tax evasion case.
	   Investors shrugged off a cut in the central bank's key overnight
rates and gains by the peso against the dollar Tuesday, traders
said.
	   The central bank cut its overnight borrowing rate to 13.375
percent from 13.500 percent, and its overnight lending rate to
15.375 percent from 15.500 percent.
	   The overnight rates influence the direction of other interest
rates. Lower rates may cause a shift in funds from fixed-income
bonds to other types of investments such as stocks.
	   ``The correction was bound to happen since the market has been
strong in the past few days,'' said Aklan. ``The correction may
continue in the next session or two, but the market is bound to
move up soon after and remain strong toward the end of the year.''
	   Aklan said the index remained fairly buoyant Tuesday despite the
presence of profit-takers. He noted that any downturn in prices was
soon met with bargain-hunting, especially among second-tier stocks.
	   In currency trading, the peso strengthened against the U.S.
dollar as strong dollar inflows overpowered the impact of the
interest rate cuts, traders said.
	   The dollar averaged 39.342 pesos for the day, down from Friday's
39.512 pesos. It traded in a thin range of 39.290 pesos to 39.400
pesos and last changed hands at 39.355 pesos.
	   Traders said most of the dollar inflows were remittances from
Filipinos working overseas.
	   An estimated 4.5 million Filipinos work abroad, sending home at
least dlrs 6 billion last year. Their foreign-exchange remittances
provide an important contribution to the Philippine economy, and
are expected to help support the peso over the rest of the year.

Indonesian troops block students from marching on ex-leader's house
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Soldiers blocked about 200 student
protesters from marching Tuesday on the house of Indonesia's former
President Suharto.
	   Suharto, 77, resigned in May after deadly riots and protests
against his 32-year authoritarian rule. Critics accused him of
siphoning off state wealth to benefit his family's massive business
empires.
	   Tuesday's protest was the latest in a series against Suharto,
who has denied allegations of wrongdoing.
	   There were no arrests or injuries.
	   Earlier, the students protested outside Jakarta's United Nations
office and demanded that several retired army generals, including
Suharto, be prosecuted for corruption and human rights abuses.
	   They also demanded that current military commander Gen. Wiranto
be put on trial.
	   Suharto's successor and former protege, President B.J. Habibie,
has ordered a commission of inquiry be set up to investigate
Suharto's wealth.
	   An earlier investigation by Attorney General Andi Mohamad Ghalib
failed to find any evidence against Suharto. Many rejected it as a
whitewash.
	   On Monday, the government postponed the appointment of the new
inquiry after it admitted that not enough people had agreed to
serve on the body.
	   Student protesters have repeatedly tried to march on Suharto's
home in recent weeks, but have been blocked by troops.

Mandela appeals to South Africans to fight AIDS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa can conquer AIDS
just as it defied the ``prophets of doom'' who predicted a violent
transition from apartheid, President Nelson Mandela said Tuesday.
	   ``South Africans have overcome obstacles which others thought
were insurmountable, because we joined hands to work for the good
of all rather than remaining divided by less important things,'' he
said.
	   Mandela gave a speech marking World AIDS Day in Mtubatuba, a
town in the Indian Ocean province of KwaZulu-Natal -- the
hardest-hit province in a country with one of the world's worst
AIDS problems.
	   One out of four adults in the province is estimated to be
infected with the HIV virus, which causes AIDS. The disease is
rapidly coursing through the country after years of isolation under
apartheid.
	   The national infection rate is as much as 14 percent. Half of
southern Africa's infections this year occurred in South Africa,
according to U.N. figures released Monday.
	   ``Although AIDS has been apart of our lives for 15 years or
more, we have kept silent about its true presence in our midst,''
Mandela said. ``We have too often spoken of it as if it was someone
else's problem.''
	   Mandela appealed to South Africans to break the silence; to show
compassion to people living with the infection and disease; to
abstain from sex or use a condom; to be tested for the virus.
	   ``Just as we defied the prophets of doom who foresaw endless
conflict in our land, we can defeat this terrible disease by all of
us accepting responsibility for prevention of infection and for
care of those who have been affected,'' Mandela said.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In an apparent attempt to crush a budding
opposition party, Chinese police have detained two of China's most
prominent dissidents and three other democracy campaigners, a human
rights group and relatives of those taken into custody said
Tuesday.
	   Police in two cities descended on the homes of Xu Wenli, Qin
Yongmin and other members of the China Democracy Party on Monday
night and took them away, relatives and the rights group said.
	   The police action was one of the harshest since dissidents
announced the formation of the would-be opposition group in June to
challenge the ruling Communist Party's monopoly on power. Since
then, police have questioned, briefly detained and harassed the
activists but refrained from filing charges.
	   Signaling the leadership's resolve to quash any challenges, the
party's No. 2, legislative chairman Li Peng, was quoted Tuesday as
saying that Western-style democracy was inappropriate for China and
opposition groups would not be tolerated.
	   If organizations seek ``the multi-party system and try to negate
the leadership of the Communist Party, then they will not be
allowed to exist,'' Li told the German business daily,
Handelsblatt, in an interview carried by China's official Xinhua
News Agency.
	   Police on Tuesday informed the family of Qin Yongmin that he was
arrested for plotting to overthrow the government, the Hong
Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China said. The crime carries a maximum penalty of life
imprisonment.
	   In taking Xu Wenli from his home Monday night, police produced
an arrest warrant and a search warrant that identified him as a
criminal suspect, said his wife, He Xitong. Unlike previous
occasions when Xu was held only for short periods, she feared this
time authorities were planning to charge and convict him.
	   Twenty police officers ransacked their Beijing apartment,
seizing a computer, a fax machine, address books, video tapes, a
typewriter, more than 1,000 pages of documents and even a
telephone, she said.
	   ``Xu Wenli has already paid heavily for democracy. I understand
that he is ready to pay again,'' said his wife. ``Xu Wenli won't
give up.''
	   Qin and Xu are among the most influential figures in China's
fractured, persecuted dissident community. Their campaigning
started in the Democracy Wall protest movement of the late 1970s.
Xu served all but three years of a 15-year jail sentence, much of
it in solitary confinement, and was released in 1993. Qin was
jailed for several years in the 1980s and then again in 1994-95.
	   Aside from Qin, police in the central city of Wuhan also hauled
away two other members of the China Democracy Party, Chen Zhonghe
and Xiao Shichang, the Information Center said.
	   A fifth member of the party, Lai Jinbiao, also was detained
Monday afternoon in eastern Hangzhou city after making a speech in
a public park demanding the Communist Party carry out political
reforms, the Information Center said.
	   One of the party's first organizers, Wang Youcai, who has been
detained in an undisclosed location for a month, was also formally
arrested Monday, the Information Center said. Police told his wife
of the arrest on Tuesday, it said.
	   Encouraged by China's recent signing of key U.N. human rights
treaties, dissidents in many parts of the country have been trying
to formally register the China Democracy Party.
	   Despite brief police detentions and almost constant
surveillance, Xu, Qin and other dissidents continued their efforts,
setting up local party branches, taking party oaths and nominating
people for party posts.
	   In their 3 and 1/2-hour search of Xu's apartment, the police
paid particular attention to documents related to the party and
made a careful record of each document they seized, his wife said.
Police also were said to be watching the homes of other party
members in Beijing.
	   Given the possibility of arrest, Xu had already prepared a bag
containing clothes and washing gear that he took with him, his wife
said.

Russian prime minister lobbies IMF chief for more loans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With Russia's leaders urgently seeking financial
help, International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus planned to
open two days of talks Tuesday on Moscow's frozen loan agreement
with the IMF.
	   Camdessus will meet Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov late
Tuesday, and is scheduled to hold broader talks with government
officials on Wednesday.
	   Russia is seeking further installments on an IMF bailout package
that was reached in the summer, but was frozen after the government
devalued the ruble and defaulted on some of its debts in August.
The IMF has said the government must come up with a realistic
recovery plan before more money will be released.
	   Camdessus is not expected to announce any breakthroughs, but his
visit does give Russia an opportunity to make its case and lobby
for fresh funds.
	   The bailout package totals dlrs 22.6 billion and also involves
the World Bank and the Japanese government, but Russia has so far
received only about dlrs 5 billion.
	   An IMF mission left town last week saying the government's
revenue forecast for next year was overly optimistic. It also
disapproved of the government's intention to lower taxes and offer
subsidies to ailing industries.
	   ``The IMF has plenty of reasons to say (to Russia), `you guys
want to borrow money from us while cutting taxes without having
learned how to collect them,''' the liberal daily Vremya said
Tuesday.
	   If the Russian government doesn't receive foreign help soon, it
will probably have to start printing money, which would drive up
inflation.
	   The government has been delaying a debate on next year's budget
as it struggles to find ways to come up with enough money to meet
its expenses. The Cabinet again delayed the discussion this week,
but insisted the delay was not connected with Camdessus' visit.
	   However, the Russian media claimed the government put off action
on the budget because it is still hoping for the IMF loans.
	   ``Everyone understands that budget parameters remain vague, and
their clarification depends on Camdessus' visit,'' the business
daily Kommersant said Tuesday.
	   Former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, who was on a trip to the
United States this week, said Russia wouldn't be able to pay dlrs
17.5 billion in foreign debt that comes due next year.
	   ``The IMF must realize that and accept compromises with Russia
in reaching agreements on restructuring foreign debts,'' Kiriyenko
said at New York University on Monday, according to the Interfax
news agency.

Lewis and Holyfield each say each other has made a mistake
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ED SCHUYLER JR. &QC; 
 &UR; AP Boxing Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Lennox Lewis says when he faces Evander
Holyfield on March 13 in Madison Square Garden, Holyfield will wish
he had continued ducking him.
	   To hear Holyfield talk, Lewis will wish the fight for the
undisputed heavyweight championship hadn't been made.
	   ``He's had his reasons for staying away from me, and they'll be
apparent in the fight,'' said Lewis, the 33-year-old WBC champion
from Britain. ``He definitely was ducking me.''
	   ``Two things are going to happen,'' said the 36-year-old
Holyfield, the WBA-IBF champion. ``I'm either going to knock him
out good or I'm going to knock him out bad.''
	   ``The fans are getting a fight they want to see,'' Lewis (34-1
with 27 knockouts) said Monday at a news conference at the Garden
to announce the fight. ``I've been waiting for this fight for such
a long time. It's basically overdue.''
	   But Holyfield (36-3, 25 knockouts) said, ``I never thought it
wouldn't happen.''
	   Promoter Don King and Seth Abraham, president and CEO of Time
Warner Sports both said it took a year to put together the match
that will distributed on pay-per-view by Time Warner's TVKO.
	   ``I predict to you we will sell the Garden out and we will have
2 million (pay-per-view buys),'' King crowed. A sellout would be
about 19,000.
	   The Garden reportedly is paying a live site fee of dlrs 8.5
million.
	   ``I can't confirm that figure,'' said Dave Checketts, Garden
president and CEO. ``Is it substantial _ yes. I think we're going
to sell out at pretty substantial prices. I think we'll be fine.
This will put us in the fight game in a very big way.''
	   The ticket prices will be scaled from dlrs 1,500 down to dlrs
100. No pay-per-view price has been announced, but it is expected
to be dlrs 49.95. One of the pay-per-view exhibitors, who keep half
of the pay-per-view revenue, will be Cablevision, which has a
universe of 3 million homes.
	   The biggest pay-per-view sale for a fight was 1.99 million for
the Holyfield-Mike Tyson rematch carried by SET. Tyson has been
involved in the four top pay-per-view bouts and seven of the top
10.
	   Holyfield said it was just circumstances that dictated the fight
not happening until now.
	   He said that after he was stopped in the eighth round in his
third bout against Riddick Bowe, a non-title fight on Nov. 4, 1995,
HBO asked him who he would like to fight, and ``I said Lennox
Lewis. He didn't want to fight me then.''
	   So Holyfield fought Bobby Czyz in the Garden on May 10, 1996,
and although he won in five rounds, he looked unimpressive.
Holyfield thinks his performance is what encouraged Tyson to defend
the WBA title against him. Holyfield's 11th-round victory led to
the rematch in which Tyson was disqualified for biting Holyfield's
ears.
	   Holyfield said he then had a chance to win the IBF title and
avenge a defeat by Michael Moorer, which he did by stopping Moorer
in the eighth round Nov. 8, 1997. He then had to fight Vaughn Beat
in an IBF mandatory defense, which he won on points Sept. 19. He
still owes a WBA mandatory defense against Henry Akinwande or the
highest available contender, which he would make on Showtime if he
wins March 13.
	   Lewis made a WBC mandatory defense by outpointing Zeljko
Mavrovic of Croatia on Sept. 26.

French court to decide fate of American fugitive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IAN PHILLIPS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ American fugitive Ira Einhorn was
appearing before a French court Tuesday for a hearing to determine
whether he'll be extradited to the United States for the 1977
murder of his girlfriend.
	   Einhorn, 57, has been sentenced in absentia to life in prison by
a Pennsylvania court for the murder of Helen ``Holly'' Maddux _ a
crime he denies, even though police found her corpse stuffed in a
trunk in his closet.
	   A prominent anti-war campaigner and New Age activist in the
1960s, Einhorn fled the United States shortly before he was due to
be tried. But after 16 years in hiding, he was tracked down and
arrested at his French home in June 1997.
	   In a November interview on ABC television, Einhorn proclaimed
his innocence.
	   ``I certainly didn't kill Holly. I don't know how (her body) got
there,'' he said, at his home in a converted mill in the Bordeaux
region.
	   Einhorn claimed the CIA or KGB framed him after he uncovered
classified mind-control experiments.
	   A French court refused to extradite Einhorn in December 1997,
citing a law that would have required a retrial if he was
extradited.
	   Pennsylvania then passed a law promising Einhorn a retrial, and
he was re-arrested in September.
	   A court then ruled he could be freed until Tuesday's hearing. It
was not clear if there would be a ruling on Tuesday.
	   His defense lawyers were to argue that, if extradited, Einhorn
could face the death penalty, which is banned under French law.
They also claim Pennsylvania courts might withdraw the pledge of a
retrial.
	   When Maddux, a former cheerleader from Tyler, Texas,
disappeared, Einhorn said she had gone shopping and never returned.
	   But when neighbors 18 months later told police of a stench
coming from Einhorn's apartment, her battered remains were found.
Forensic experts said her skull had been smashed six times.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ American singer Paul Simon can't
testify via video in the fraud trial of anti-apartheid activist
Allan Boesak, a judge has ruled.
	   Simon had said his workload prevented him from traveling to
South Africa, but agreed to testify against Boesak via telephone or
video from New York City.
	   Judge John Foxcroft on Monday ruled against such a hook-up. He
gave no explanation.
	   Simon donated 600,000 rand (dlrs 180,000 at the time) to
Boesak's Foundation for Peace and Justice Charity.
	   A former minister who once headed the World Alliance of Reformed
Churches, Boesak, 52, allegedly stole 1 million rand (dlrs 300,000
at the time) from the foundation.
	   Much of the money was from Simon, Scandinavian donors and the
Coca-Cola Foundation.
	   It was not immediately clear what the prosecutor's next move
would be.

Report: economic freedom in Asia significantly decreased in turmoil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Although Hong Kong and Singapore retain their
top places in an annual index ranking levels of economic freedom,
Asian governments grappling with a protracted financial crisis are
imposing tighter economic controls, a U.S. think tank said Tuesday.
	   Hong Kong, which has held the title of the freest economy in the
world for the past three years, won this year only on a
technicality, said the conservative Heritage Foundation.
	   The list was compiled in June, before the Hong Kong government's
foray into the financial markets in August in an attempt to drive
out speculators, the foundation said. Since the market
intervention, Hong Kong has lost the title for the freest economy
to Singapore.
	   ``It is my sad duty to report that Hong Kong, as of today, no
longer has the freest economy in the world,'' the foundation's
president, Edwin Feulner, said at a press conference.
	   Hong Kong is not unique in backing away from economic freedom as
financial troubles sweep across the world, the group said. The
survey showed for the first time since the project started in 1995,
more countries curtailed economic freedom during the past year than
expanded it.
	   ``Far too many countries have reacted in exactly the wrong
manner to the global economic downturn,'' said Kim R. Holmes, the
foundation's vice president.
	   These countries should have been eliminating existing
restrictions on trade and investment, freeing their banking and
currency systems from bureaucratic and political manipulation,
Holmes said.
	   Malaysia introduced tight currency controls to isolate its
battered economy from the regional fallout.
	   The study rates the freedom of 161 countries' economies by
trade, tax, monetary and banking policies.
	   It also considers government intervention in the economy,
capital flows and foreign investment as well as wage and price
controls.
	   Following Singapore and Hong Kong in the rankings was Bahrain.
New Zealand came fourth and Switzerland was fifth. The United
States was ranked sixth.
	   Ireland, Luxembourg, Taiwan and Britain were all tied for 10th
place.
	   Japan dropped one notch from 11th to 12th. The group said the
Japanese government's response to the recession has been lackluster
so far.
	   ``If Japan think it can emerge from the economic doldrums with
paltry tax cuts and a dose of government spending, it is
mistaken,'' Feulner said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin is feeling better, but is
still spending part of the day in a hospital bed as he continues to
be treated for pneumonia, officials said Tuesday.
	   A Kremlin spokesman said the president was doing limited
paperwork and there were no plans for any meetings or visitors. He
did not say how much longer Yeltsin would remain in the government
hospital where he has been for 10 days.
	   Yeltsin's first deputy chief of staff Oleg Sysuyev told
reporters on Tuesday that the president is expected to return to
work at the Kremlin ``in the nearest time.''
	   ``Doctors are having trouble keeping the president in the
hospital,'' Sysuyev said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The 67-year-old leader is known as a restless patient who
sometimes ignores the advice of his doctors.

South Korean appeals court upholds conviction of ex-spy agents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A South Korean appeals court on
Tuesday upheld lower-court convictions of six people found guilty
of plotting to destroy President Kim Dae-jung's election campaign
last year.
	   But it reduced the prison term of Lee Dae-sung, a former senior
official of South Korea's intelligence agency, from 2 years in
prison to 1 1/2-years.
	   Lee was found guilty of paying dlrs 250,000 to a Korean-American
businessman who falsely claimed in news conferences in Beijing,
Tokyo and Seoul ahead of the Dec. 18 election that Kim's campaign
was funded by communist North Korea.
	   The appeals court also reduced the prison term of the
businessman, Yoon Hong-joon, by six months to 1 1/2-years.
	   The court upheld suspended prison terms for four lower-ranking
intelligence agents. They were found guilty of violating election
laws and a law that called for their agency to maintain a neutral
stance in domestic politics.
	   Details of the alleged smear campaign were not widely reported
in local media and Kim, an opposition candidate, eventually won the
election by a narrow margin.
	   Seven other agents, including the agency's ex-chief, Kwon
Young-hae, were tried separately. Kwon was sentenced to five years
in prison in September for masterminding the smear campaign.
	   South Korea remains staunchly anti-communist after fighting a
war with North Korea in 1950-53.
	   Under South Korea's past authoritarian governments, the spy
agency often portrayed dissidents or political opponents as
communists to destroy their careers.

Philippine government files tax evasion charges against airline
</HEADLINE>
head

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government filed tax
evasion charges Tuesday against a business tycoon with close ties
to President Joseph Estrada despite claims by the chief revenue
official that the evidence against the suspect was weak.
	   The Department of Justice has been investigating charges by the
Bureau of Internal Revenue that Lucio Tan, his flagship company,
Fortune Tobacco Corp., and 11 affiliated companies owe the
government 26.5 billion pesos (dlrs 673.4 million) in unpaid taxes.
	   Tan, one of the wealthiest men in the Philippines, also has
interests in banking and beer brewing, and is chairman and
controlling owner of the financially distressed national carrier,
Philippine Airlines.
	   It was not immediately clear whether the charges filed by the
Justice Department covered all the tax cases previously under
investigation.
	   One charge sheet, however, showed the government claiming around
723.8 million pesos (dlrs 18.4 million) in unpaid taxes. A court
officer said they were still sorting the documents filed Tuesday
afternoon.
	   Revenue chief Beethoven Rualo was quoted by a local newspaper
last week as saying that the tax case against Tan would not succeed
because the evidence ``will not stand up to the scrutiny of the
court.''
	   Rualo, who took office after Estrada assumed the presidency on
June 30, reversed his predecessor's position that there was
voluminous evidence supporting the government's charges against
Tan.
	   Following his statement, Estrada's spokesman, Jerry Barican,
said that considering the revenue agency's new assessment of the
case, the government will not spend money ``in a complicated tax
case like this ... knowing fully well that at the end of the day
the evidence it has on hand may not be sufficient.''
	   There was no immediate explanation of why the government
proceeded with the charges, and no comments from Tan's lawyers.
	   Following Philippine legal procedures, the cases will be divided
among various courts, which will set the arraignment.

Iraq says it won't bother to jam broadcasts by U.S.-backed radio
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi authorities say they are so
unconcerned about new U.S.-sponsored broadcasts aimed at
undermining President Saddam Hussein that they won't even bother to
jam the transmissions.
	   Government media officials said the decision was made because
Iraqis, already inundated by radio stations hostile to Baghdad's
leaders, are unlikely to pay attention to Radio Free Iraq. The
broadcasts are being transmitted from the Czech Republic.
	   ``It is just a drop in the ocean. It is going to do nothing,''
Sami Mahdi, editor in chief of the ruling Baath Party newspaper
Al-Thawra, said Monday.
	   Iraqis can hear broadcasts opposed to Saddam's government from
neighboring Iran, Kuwait and Syria as well as from northern Iraq,
which is under the control of Kurdish rebels.
	   In addition, the British Broadcasting Corp., Voice of America,
the French-sponsored Radio Monte Carlo and Israel Radio have
Arabic-language broadcasts that are heard throughout the Middle
East.
	   Radio Free Iraq entered the crowded market four weeks ago,
operating with a dlrs 5 million budget from Radio Free Europe-Radio
Liberty, known for broadcasts into eastern Europe during Soviet
control.
	   The U.S.-funded operation in Prague also started broadcasts at
the same time to Iran, which receives a host of Farsi-language
broadcasts from around the globe and several programs transmitted
by the Iranian opposition based in Iraq.
	   In Baghdad, a few Iraqis said they have heard Radio Free Iraq's
Arabic-language news and commentary, but the broadcasts don't seem
to have generated great interest.
	   While Mahdi called the station a ``wretched voice,'' others say
it is relatively tame, featuring announcers reading reports from
international news agencies.
	   From their own newspapers and radio and television stations,
Iraqis get a stream of pro-government views. But they also can hear
wild diatribes against Saddam on opposition stations.
	   From Iran, the Voice of Islamic Revolution in Iraq regularly
accuses the Baghdad government of being a puppet of the United
States in general and the CIA in particular.
	   From northern Iraq comes the Voice of the Iraqi People, which
has been telling Iraqis for the past eight years that the days of
the Baghdad government are numbered.
	   Another opposition station, the Voice of the Armed Forces and
Internal Security, usually broadcasts in code. ``From X to C. Move
position and get in touch with S,'' is typical of its output.

Underwear with built-in cushioning aims to prevent broken hips
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch inventors have designed a
set of underwear with special built-in padding in an effort to
reduce the number of broken hips suffered by the elderly.
	   The new briefs, which are being tested in conjunction with an
Amsterdam teaching hospital, should cushion falls which can often
cause broken hips, the Algemeen Dagblad newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   ARTU Biologicals, the manufacturer, says the hard polypropylene
plates covered in a soft coating and built into the underwear will
help spread and soften the impact of a fall. In the Netherlands
alone, about 16,000 broken hips are reported each year.
	   Costing 160 guilders (dlrs 85) a pair, the underwear will be
tested at nursing homes throughout the Netherlands early next year.

Most Asian shares lower, Hong Kong market plummets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with closing figures for all markets.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed sharply lower
Tuesday on the back of Wall Street's decline, with the key index in
Hong Kong tumbling for a third straight session.
	   Hong Kong's blue chip Hang Seng Index plummeted 4.1 percent as
the market digested a host of negative economic data as well as
Monday's 2.3 percent fall by the Dow Jones industrial average in
New York.
	   The Hang Seng closed below the psychologically important level
of 10,000 points to end at 9,975.85, down 426.47 points.
	   Traders are worried about Hong Kong's economy, which is
struggling through recession, said Michael Ng, dealing director at
Sassoon Securities.
	   Hong Kong's gross domestic product fell by 7 percent in the
third quarter, prompting the government to lower its economic
forecast a 5 percent contraction for 1998. Since that gloomy news
was announced Friday, the market has shed 7.1 percent.
	   Late Monday, the government reported its budget deficit for the
first seven months of the fiscal year had reached 50.16 billion
Hong Kong dollar (U.S. dlrs 6.43 billion).
	   That figure was well above the 21 billion Hong Kong dollar (dlrs
2.69 billion) deficit the government estimated for the fiscal year
that ends March 31.
	   Singapore shares also tumbled as investors took profits
following the slump on Wall Street. The Straits Times Index fell
3.4 percent, or 47.85 points, to close at 1,368.70.
	   In Tokyo, the Nikkei average of 225 selected issues fell 48.29
points, or 0.3 percent, to 14,835.41 after a 185.69-point fall
Monday.
	   Traders said the market reacted mildly to Wall Street's drop and
news that JDC, a financially troubled contractor, had filed for
legal protection from creditors.
	   ``Despite JDC's failure and the overnight drop in New York, the
market showed some resilience,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general
manager of the stock division at Chuo Securities.
	   Buacking the trend was the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange, where
share prices extended a recent rally, with the key index closing up
3.5 percent on what traders describe as buying spurred by year-end
window dressing.
	   At the close, the Malaysian market's key Composite Index rose
17.28 points to 518.75.
	   Elsewhere:
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower, dragged down by concerns over
the stability of Taiwan's banking sector and amid caution ahead of
legislative elections this weekend. The market's key Weighted Stock
Price Index rose 74.85 points, or 1.04 percent, to 7,102.37.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower, with the
index falling to a four-week low in reaction to the drop overnight
on Wall Street. The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 41.33
points, or 2.1 percent, to 1,950.01.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares tumbled as investors cashed in on
gains made in the past session after the decline in U.S. stocks.
The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 53.57 points, or
2.7 percent, to 1,921.79.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed generally lower after a
fall in New York stocks and lower commodity prices on the London
Metal Exchange. The All Ordinaries Index fell 39.1 points, or 1.4
percent, to 2,734.1.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed mixed. The Korea Composite Stock
Price Index fell 5.92 points, or 1.3 percent, to 445.96.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed 1.8 percent lower. The Stock
Exchange of Thailand index dropped 6.66 points to 356.16.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed mixed on late buying of some big
capitalization stocks. The Composite Index rose 1.464 points to
387.735.

Hoechst, Rhone-Poulenc announce agreement to merge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New grafs 8-11 to UPDATE with Rhone Poulenc shares down, other
details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Two of Europe's largest drug makers, Hoechst of
Germany and Rhone-Poulenc of France, announced Tuesday they are
merging their pharmaceutical and agrochemical operations.
	   The new company will be called Aventis, said a statement
released by the two companies. It is to be based in Strasbourg,
eastern France, where a press conference was to be held later
Tuesday.
	   The agreement ``launches the procedure for the first phase of a
two-step plan which will eventually lead to a full merger of
Hoechst and Rhone Poulenc,'' the statement said.
	   ``We want to create a new company, with European roots and
global reach, to take full advantage of the extensive opportunities
of life sciences in the 21st century,'' said the two chairmen,
Jean-Rene Fourtu of Rhone Poulenc and Jurgen Dormann of Hoechst.
	   It was ``anticipated'' that Dormann would be the new chairman of
Aventis, and Fourtu the vice chairman, the statement said.
	   Analysts have warned against a full merger until the heavily
indebted firms reduce costs.
	   With annual sales of around dlrs 20 billion, the new company
will be tied for the No. 1 ranking with Switzerland's Novartis in
the life-sciences sector.
	   The two companies said they expected annual synergies of dlrs
1.2 billion in three years, with 60 percent of those generated in
their pharmaceutical operations and 40 percent in agrochemicals.
	   Unions in France and Germany have been critical of the merger,
fearing layoffs. Hoechst employs 118,000 workers and Rhone-Poulenc,
68,000.
	   Rhone Poulenc shares were 5.8 percent lower in morning trading
as investors expressed displeasure that a full merger hadn't been
announced.

Romania split as it marks 80 years since Transylvania reunited
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ In a giant military parade which cost
this impoverished country a fortune, Romania on Tuesday celebrated
80 years since it was reunited with Transylvania.
	   In freezing weather, some 20,000 people and military troops
gathered outside the giant palace built by former communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in celebrations with a distinctly
military feel.
	   But the festivities, designed to give the country a boost, were
marred by splits among Romania's political parties and criticism
that 3 billion lei (dlrs 300,000) spent to mark the day was
breaking the impoverished country's budget.
	   The average monthly wage in Romania is 1.2 million lei (dlrs
120).
	   The nationalist opposition boycotted the celebrations in the
capital and traveled to Alba Iulia in Transylvania where the
original reunification took place in 1918.
	   Romania was awarded Transylvania and the northern region of
Bukovina as part of the spoils of WWI. British-born Queen Marie
fought Romania's case to regain lost territory.
	   In Bucharest President Emil Constantinescu, flanked by the head
of the Orthodox Church, took off his fur hat as the temperature
hovered at -4 C (25F) in respect for the military parade of 4,000
soldiers. Priests officiated a service and the ceremony was
broadcast live on state-run and private television.
	   ``This celebration will have a positive impact on the young
people in the army,'' said Lt. Col. Ion Petrescu as Puma
helicopters and Hercules airplanes buzzed overhead.
	   For the past week, helicopters and airplanes practicing for the
ceremony have flown low over the capital and tanks have rolled past
Ceausescu's palace, which now houses the parliament.

President begins new consultations to select premier
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ZEINA KARAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ President Emile Lahoud began a fresh
round of consultations with Parliament on Tuesday in search of a
new premier after incumbent Prime Minister Rafik Hariri bowed out.
	   Lahoud first met for about 15 minutes with former Prime Minister
Salim Hoss, a member of the parliament who is widely expected to be
asked by the president to form a new government.
	   Lahoud then began consulting members of the 128-seat Parliament,
who under Lebanon's constitution make recommendations on the
premier to the president.
	   Hariri's Cabinet has been serving in a caretaker capacity since
Lahoud was inaugurated as Lebanon's new president last week.
	   Lahoud began the latest round of consultations, which are
expected to last two days, after Hariri declined to name a new
Cabinet following an earlier round of consultations with
Parliament.
	   Hariri's move could be a ploy to gain more power as a new
government is formed, but the crisis atmosphere generated by his
possible departure could affect Lebanon's economic recovery.
	   Central bank officials on Monday tried to calm fears about a run
on the Lebanese pound by announcing that the bank was ready to
intervene with its foreign currency reserves, the state-run
National News Agency reported. It added that the money markets
remained stable.
	   In the initial round, Parliament members gave Hariri a majority.
But that was far short of the near-unanimous backing he received in
three previous mandates since 1992.
	   Hariri, 53, a business tycoon who launched Lebanon's
multi-billion dollar reconstruction from the devastation of the
1975-90 civil war, said Monday in an interview with CNN that he was
no longer a candidate.
	   He demanded that Lahoud admit that he acted unconstitutionally
by allowing 31 Parliament deputies to authorize him to name a prime
minister instead of naming one themselves.
	   Lahoud, 62, is an army commander who wants to assert his
authority at the start of his six-year presidential term. Hariri
virtually has had a free hand in running the country since he
became premier six years ago under former President Elias Hrawi.
	   Several Parliament members who had named Hariri as their choice
for prime minister were expected to name Hoss in the new round of
consultations.
	   Salim Hoss, 69, a U.S.-educated economist, served four times as
prime minister since 1976, including a term in 1988 during the
darkest days of Lebanon's civil war.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ France's oil giant Total SA agreed to
take over the Belgian petrochemicals company Petrofina SA to create
the sixth-largest oil company in the world, the companies announced
Tuesday.
	   The move was the latest in a series of mergers affecting the
global oil market. The new company, known as Total Fina, will be
quoted on the Paris, Brussels, New York and London stock exchanges,
a joint statement said.
	   ``The combination of Total and Petrofina will allow the new
entity to capture substantial productivity gains, particularly in
the North Sea, and to expand its positions in the deep offshore
(United States, Angola),'' the statement said.
	   The Paris stock exchange was not immediately convinced and Total
shares took a big hit, falling almost 10 percent in early trading
Tuesday.
	   ``When you add a sliding dollar and sluggish crude oil prices to
the fact that investors have no details yet to gauge the benefits
of the Petrofina takeover, you get a tumbling stock,'' said a Paris
trader.
	   Petrofina's stock stood at 14,250 francs (dlrs 407.9) Friday
before it was suspended for Monday's trading. The deal put the
value at 19.482 francs (dlrs 557.7), a jump in value of more than a
third.
	   The agreement is based on a stock swap that provides nine Total
Fina shares for two Petrofina shares. Total Fina will have a
controlling stake in 41 percent of Petrofina, which specializes in
refinery.
	   The market capitalization of both companies combined stood at
1,391 billion Belgian francs (dlrs 39.9 billion).
	   The merger comes amid many changes in the oil industry. In
August, British Petroleum announced a $49 billion takeover of Amoco
Corp. And The Washington Post reported Tuesday that an agreement
had been reached for Exxon Corp. to buy Mobil. The oil companies,
the two largest in the United States, say only that talks are
ongoing.
	   Petrofina stock has been gaining ground in recent days on rumors
that the company was in talks with France's Elf Aquitaine SA, Total
SA and Italy's ENI SpA. Tuesday's announcement made Belgian
investor Albert Frere, who controlled 30 percent of Petrofina
shares, the biggest shareholder of Total Fina.
	   ``In refining-marketing, Total Fina will hold solid positions''
in the European Union. ``Joint management of the refineries and the
marketing networks should yield substantial productivity gains,''
the statement said.
	   A combined general meeting of shareholders has been called for
Jan. 14 to approve the agreement. Total said a public offering on
the remaining Petrofina shares will follow.
	   Petrofina, which employs 15,000 people worldwide, is one of
Belgium's biggest industrial companies. It is best known for its
refining and distribution operations in Europe and the United
States.
	   Total SA is the smaller of France's two oil companies and has
aggressively expanded its upstream business, mainly through
exploration and especially in gas.

German, French leaders call for jobs and growth

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with leaders reportedly agree on jobs and

<TEXT>
	   POTSDAM, Germany (AP) _ Leaders of Germany and France agreed
Tuesday to strengthen efforts to fight unemployment and boost the
economy, a well-placed source said, reflecting a stronger emphasis
on a left-leaning agenda for Europe.
	   The source, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity,
left unclear what common initiatives might be planned. The leaders
were issuing a joint declaration later Tuesday after a two-day
German-French summit hosted by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, his
first since he and his Social Democrats won September elections in
Germany.
	   Both sides also agreed that cooperation among industrial nations
to combat economically damaging turmoil in financial markets was a
desirable goal, the source said.
	   Schroeder met French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, a Socialist,
Tuesday morning after one-on-one talks with President Jacques
Chirac on Monday.
	   Schroeder told Chirac that he supports a merger of German and
British aerospace industries, even if France, Germany's closest
partner in Europe, doesn't join in from the start, officials said.
	   Schroeder stressed, though, that the door would be left open to
later French participation.
	   Efforts for a European aerospace merger to compete with U.S.
giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin are a central theme of the
summit. The big European aircraft makers _ Daimler-Benz Aerospace,
British Aerospace and Aerospatiale _ agreed in principle in March
to seek a merger.
	   Daimler-Benz Aerospace and British Aerospace are in advanced
talks on a two-way alliance. One stumbling block to Aerospatiale's
early participation is that the aircraft maker is still partly
government-owned and progress toward full privatization has been
slow.
	   Defense ministers were discussing the topic separately Tuesday.
	   Schroeder called Monday for ``a new beginning'' in German-French
relations, Europe's most important partnership and traditionally
the engine behind the drive for postwar European unity.
	   Germany and France hold summits twice yearly, but this meeting
has special significance ahead of Jan. 1, when Europe launches its
single currency, the euro, and Germany takes over the rotating
six-month presidency of the European Union.
	   German demands to lower its contribution to the EU budget were
one of the summit's more thorny topics. But German deputy foreign
minister Guenter Verheugen said that the French showed ``great
understanding'' for Germany's pressure, which comes as the EU tries
to streamline its budget and administration to get ready for new
members from the former Soviet bloc.
	   Germany, the biggest contributor to the EU budget, annually pays
in 22 billion marks (dlrs 12 billion) more into EU coffers than it
gets out in funds.

UNHCR worried over Greek treatment of asylum seekers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency said Tuesday it is
concerned at Greece's treatment of asylum seekers, the majority of
them from Iraq.
	   ``We are receiving increasing reports on incidents of
deportation (and) extremely slow asylum procedures,'' said Kris
Janowski, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
	   Some refugees are having to wait over a year for an asylum
interview, and are given no proper documents to state that they are
seeking asylum, he added.
	   UNHCR has appealed to the Greek authorities to address the
situation, ``so far to no avail,'' Janowski said.
	   Tens of thousands of illegal immigrants sneak into Greece each
year, mainly from Albania or Turkey.
	   Last year, more than 4,300 people applied for asylum in Greece,
of whom some 3,800 were Iraqis, according to UNHCR.
	   Less than half of the applications were examined and 130
accepted. That is one of the lowest rates in Europe, Janowski said.
	   Up to the end of October, some 2,200 mostly Iraqi refugees this
year applied for asylum and 140 were successful.
	   ``People who seek asylum in Greece are generally returned to
Turkey, no matter where they come from,'' Janowski said.
	   Greece has just one reception center for refugees. ``As a
result, many asylum seekers basically rough it on the streets,''
according to Janowski.
	   He put the problems down to ``financial constraints,'' but added
that ``these resources must be found.''

 &UR; UN chief, on quest to salvage referendum, meets Algerian officials &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Annan in Algiers, plans for meetings Tuesday &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan,
working to salvage a plan to end the quarter-century-long Western
Sahara crisis, was meeting Tuesday with Algerian officials, a day
after touring a refugee camp.
	   Annan was set to meet President Liamine Zeroual, Foreign
Minister Ahmed Attaf and Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahai, among
others.
	   His personal effort to revive stalled plans for a U.N.-sponsored
referendum on the fate of the Western Sahara underscored what now
appears to be a pressing need to move ahead _ or lose the
opportunity.
	   At stake is whether the Italy-sized territory should remain in
Morocco's hands or become an independent state. Polisario Front
rebels for decades battled Moroccan troops for the territory's
independence.
	   The referendum had been set for Dec. 7 but has now been moved to
December 1999. It has been bogged down over disputes about who has
the right to cast a ballot. Morocco insists that some 65,000 people
from three tribes should be on the list that now carries some
90,000 names.
	   Annan visited Morocco and the Western Sahara territory claimed
by the kingdom in early November, but was forced back to his New
York headquarters by the Iraqi crisis.
	   He took up the trip again on Monday with a visit to the Smara
refugee camp, one of several camps in the bleak desert of southern
Algeria run by Polisario Front rebels seeking independence for the
Western Sahara.
	   Morocco annexed the former Spanish Sahara after Madrid abandoned
it in 1975 and has developed a vast infrastructure there at great
expense.
	   In Smara, Annan said he got full agreement from Polisario chief
Mohammed Abdelaziz to new proposals on how to resolve the dispute
over who can take part in the referendum, but that Morocco wanted
further clarification.
	   Plans for a referendum began after the United Nations clinched a
cease-fire in 1991 between the Polisario and the Moroccan army.
	   Annan has said he hoped neighboring countries like Mauritania
could play a useful role in helping to resolve the crisis.

Underwear with built-in cushioning aims to prevent broken hips
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch inventors have designed
underwear with special built-in padding in an effort to reduce the
number of broken hips suffered by the elderly.
	   The new briefs, which are being tested in conjunction with an
Amsterdam teaching hospital, should cushion falls which can often
cause broken hips, the Algemeen Dagblad newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   ARTU Biologicals, the manufacturer, says the hard polypropylene
plates covered in a soft coating and built into the underwear will
help spread and soften the impact of a fall. In the Netherlands
alone, about 16,000 broken hips are reported each year.
	   Costing 160 guilders (dlrs 85) a pair, the underwear will be
tested at nursing homes throughout the Netherlands early next year.

Russian prime minister lobbies IMF chief for more loans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Yeltsin's aide in new 9th graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With Russia's leaders urgently seeking financial
help, International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus planned to
open two days of talks Tuesday on Moscow's frozen loan agreement
with the IMF.
	   Camdessus will meet Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov late
Tuesday, and is scheduled to hold broader talks with government
officials on Wednesday.
	   Russia is seeking further installments on an IMF bailout package
that was reached in the summer, but was frozen after the government
devalued the ruble and defaulted on some of its debts in August.
The IMF has said the government must come up with a realistic
recovery plan before more money will be released.
	   Camdessus is not expected to announce any breakthroughs, but his
visit does give Russia an opportunity to make its case and lobby
for fresh funds.
	   The bailout package totals dlrs 22.6 billion and also involves
the World Bank and the Japanese government, but Russia has so far
received only about dlrs 5 billion.
	   An IMF mission left town last week saying the government's
revenue forecast for next year was overly optimistic. It also
disapproved of the government's intention to lower taxes and offer
subsidies to ailing industries.
	   ``The IMF has plenty of reasons to say (to Russia), `you guys
want to borrow money from us while cutting taxes without having
learned how to collect them,''' the liberal daily Vremya said
Tuesday.
	   If the Russian government doesn't receive foreign help soon, it
will probably have to start printing money, which would drive up
inflation.
	   ``I hope that the IMF would be able to make a decision to
provide aid to Russia that would allow us to avoid
hyperinflation,'' Oleg Sysuyev, a top presidential aide, was quoted
as saying Tuesday by the Interfax news agency.
	   The government has been delaying a debate on next year's budget
as it struggles to find ways to come up with enough money to meet
its expenses. The Cabinet again delayed the discussion this week,
but insisted the delay was not connected with Camdessus' visit.
	   However, the Russian media claimed the government put off action
on the budget because it is still hoping for the IMF loans.
	   ``Everyone understands that budget parameters remain vague, and
their clarification depends on Camdessus' visit,'' the business
daily Kommersant said Tuesday.
	   Former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, who was on a trip to the
United States this week, said Russia wouldn't be able to pay dlrs
17.5 billion in foreign debt that comes due next year.
	   ``The IMF must realize that and accept compromises with Russia
in reaching agreements on restructuring foreign debts,'' Kiriyenko
said at New York University on Monday, according to the Interfax
news agency.

French court to decide fate of American fugitive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from victim's sister; Einhorn refuses
comment. &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN PHILLIPS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ American fugitive Ira Einhorn was
appearing before a French court Tuesday for a hearing to determine
whether he'll be extradited to the United States for the 1977
murder of his girlfriend.
	   Einhorn, 57, has been sentenced in absentia to life in prison by
a Pennsylvania court for the murder of Helen ``Holly'' Maddux _ a
crime he denies, even though police found her corpse stuffed in a
trunk in his closet.
	   A prominent anti-war campaigner and New Age activist in the
1960s, Einhorn fled the United States shortly before he was due to
be tried. But after 16 years in hiding, he was tracked down and
arrested at his French home in June 1997.
	   Einhorn entered the court building Tuesday holding hands with
his companion, Anika Flodin, and refused to answer questions.
	   But the victim's sister, Elisabeth Hall, accompanied by other
family members, was more outspoken.
	   ``We are here in France to remind the judges that underneath all
this international law and political squabbling, there is a person
who was murdered and who looks like us,'' Hall said.
	   ``Anybody can see there has been a definite undercurrent of
anti-Americanism,'' she said.
	   After a French court refused to extradite Einhorn in December
1997, citing a law that would have required a retrial if he was
extradited, Pennsylvania passed a law promising Einhorn a retrial.
He was re-arrested in September.
	   A court then ruled he could be freed until Tuesday's hearing. It
was not clear if there would be a ruling on Tuesday.
	   His defense lawyers were to argue that, if extradited, Einhorn
could face the death penalty, which is banned under French law.
They also claim Pennsylvania courts might withdraw the pledge of a
retrial.
	   In a November interview on ABC television, Einhorn proclaimed
his innocence and claimed the CIA or KGB framed him after he
uncovered classified mind-control experiments.
	   When Maddux, a former cheerleader from Tyler, Texas,
disappeared, Einhorn said she had gone shopping and never returned.
	   But when neighbors 18 months later told police of a stench
coming from Einhorn's apartment, her battered remains were found.
Forensic experts said her skull had been smashed six times.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Authorities assigned more than 20,000
policemen to a politically charged Champions League match Wednesday
pitting Juventus of Italy against Turkey's Galatasaray.
	   ``We will do our best to start and finish the game without any
incidents,'' Interior Minister Kutlu Aktas told reporters Tuesday.
``Everyone should know that this is a sports competition.''
	   The tight security measures are intended to protect Juventus
players from any possible acts by Turks angry at Italy for refusing
to extradite a Kurdish rebel leader.
	   Italy has declined to return Ocalan, who was arrested in Rome on
Nov. 12, because he faces the death penalty in Turkey for capital
crimes. Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, has been fighting
for autonomy in southeastern Turkey for 14 years and the Turkish
government holds him responsible for thousands of deaths.
	   Aktas said that police will use a heavy hand against
troublemakers, warning that ``whoever gets involved in provocative
acts will be severely punished.''
	   Private NTV television said some 22,000 policemen were assigned
to the match. Aktas said military units would also be called in.
	   The game will be played after a one-week postponement by
European soccer's governing body UEFA for security concerns.
Tension has declined since then.
	   Mass circulation dailies also called on the fans to stay calm.
	   ``Welcome Juve,'' headlined the daily Hurriyet in Italian,
saying Turks would put to shame those who have said Turkey was
unsafe by showing ``maturity and hospitality.''
	   NTV said police would search spectators entering the Ali Sami
Yen stadium for knives and clubs. Banners and fireworks are also
banned.
	   Roads to be used by Juventus players will be cordoned off, daily
Milliyet said.
	   But it was not clear if the measures would ease Juventus'
concerns.
	   Juventus general director Luiciano Moggi said Monday that they
``will not be going calmly,'' to Istanbul.
	   In a concession to the players' misgivings, the club announced
it would fly to Istanbul hours before the game and depart
immediately after the match. Juventus had planned to head to
Istanbul on Tuesday.
	   Several Juventus players, including French World Cup hero
Zinedine Zidane, had threatened to refuse to play in Istanbul.
	   ``We were kind of forced to go to play. We're very worried,''
Juventus 'keeper Angelo Peruzzi said Monday. ``UEFA and the Italian
and Turkish governments know that they have taken on a big
responsibility.''
	   Prior to the UEFA postponement, demonstrators set fire to a Fiat
car, a motorbike and numerous Italian flags.
	   Galatasaray has accused UEFA of favoring the Italian team by
postponing the game and allegedly giving injured Juventus players
time to recover.
	   Galatasaray coach Fatih Terim vowed to defeat Juve.
	   ``Hopefully, we will write history,'' sports daily Foto Mac
quoted Terim as saying Tuesday. ``Italians will return empty
handed.''
	   Romanian striker Gheorghe Hagi of Galatasaray was more cautious.
	   ``Ignoring Juventus' power would be suicide,'' Hagi said.
	   Galatasaray has seven points in Group B, one behind Norway's
Rosenborg. Juventus has four, but both teams have played one fewer
game than the Norwegians.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The beleaguered Hong Kong economy was hit
Tuesday with another string of bad news _ the key stock index fell
more than 4 percent, more companies announced layoffs and the
financial secretary hinted at a second straight budget deficit in
the next fiscal year.
	   In another blow to the territory, the Heritage Foundation, a
prominent U.S. think tank, said in a report released Tuesday that
Singapore has unseated Hong Kong as the world's freest economy.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index, which fell 3.2 percent Monday,
plummeted another 4.1 percent to close Tuesday at 9,975.85 points,
below the psychologically important level of 10,000 points. It was
the lowest close since Nov. 12.
	   The index already has shed 7.1 percent since last Friday, when
the government announced that the economy shrank 7 percent in the
third quarter, the biggest decline recorded for Hong Kong in the
postwar era.
	   ``People are worried about the surge in unemployment, high
interest rates and falling inflation,'' said Michael Ng, dealing
director at Sassoon Securities.
	   More than 450 people have lost their jobs so far this week as
two major companies _ Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company and
Citibank _ announced layoffs.
	   Unemployment, already at 5.3 percent, the highest level since
1981 when officials started collecting such data, is expected to
climb further.
	   The territory also is bracing itself for deflation as spending
continues to fall.
	   Despite the grim economic outlook, Financial Secretary Donald
Tsang warned in an address to business leaders Tuesday that the
government has limited abilities to increase spending and to cut
taxes because of it growing budget deficit.
	   On Monday, the government reported that it posted a gaping 50.16
billion Hong Kong dollar (U.S. dlrs 6.43 billion) deficit in the
first seven months of this fiscal year, well above an earlier
forecast of 21 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 2.69 billion) for
the entire fiscal year.
	   Tsang also hinted at a second straight budget deficit in the
next fiscal year beginning April 1, 1999.
	   It's unusual for the fiscally conservative Hong Kong government
to run a deficit two years in a row.
	   At a news conference, Edwin Feulner, the Heritage Foundation's
president, said the government's unprecedented market intervention
in August had cost Hong Kong the title of world's freest economy,
which it had held for three straight years.
	   To drive out speculators who were trying to depress stock prices
and drive up interest rates, the government launched a stock and
stock futures buying spree to prop up share prices, and later
changed the rules in the futures trading to tighten control.
	   Tsang reiterated that the intervention was a one-time action.
	   ``We are not a command economy, we are a free economy _ by any
fair measure, the freest in the world,'' he said. ``Hong Kong will
never close its markets to goods or services. We will never have
exchange controls.''

UEFA turns down Juventus request to arrive in Turkey Wednesday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA sees no reason to allow Juventus
to arrive in Turkey for its Champions League game against
Galatasaray on the day of the match, the European governing body
said Tuesday.
	   Juventus had asked UEFA for permission to arrive in Istanbul
Wednesday, in a concession to players' misgivings over traveling to
Turkey in the light of the country's political tensions with Italy.
	   The match is going ahead after a one-week postponement by UEFA
over security concerns. Tension has declined since then.
	   UEFA said it sees ``no valid reason to grant an exception'' to
competition rules which state teams must arrive at the match venue
no later than the previous evening.
	   ``The clause is considered to be essential in order to allow
smooth preparations for the match, in particular for the visiting
team,'' UEFA said in a statement.
	   In a reply to the Juventus request, UEFA said ``it will be the
club's own decision to adhere to the regulations or not.''
	   If the Italian team travels Wednesday, ``we would draw your
attention to the fact that the matter would then be submitted to
UEFA's disciplinary bodies,'' it added.

China says Jiang's trip to lead to `sound, stable' Japan ties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ President Jiang Zemin's historic visit to Japan
will help the two Asian neighbors develop a peaceful partnership, a
government spokesman said Tuesday, dismissing the view that the
trip was a diplomatic failure.
	   The visit, the first by a Chinese head of state since World War
II, had been seen as an opportunity to bury acrimony over Japanese
wartime atrocities in China. But Tokyo did not include a full
written apology in a joint statement.
	   The Chinese Foreign Ministry, however, took a positive tone
Tuesday in evaluating the six-day visit, which ended Monday.
	   ``In the talks and in the joint declaration, the Japanese side
has clearly expressed its deep remorse and heartfelt apology,''
ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang said at a routine briefing.
	   ``Statements are important, but more important are the deeds,''
he added. ``We hope the Japanese government can use the correct
historical perspective to guide the younger generation and continue
its way toward peace and development.''
	   The visit was ``smooth, successful and achieved important
results,'' Tang said.
	   What was most important was the agreement to continue friendly
relations and seek peace and common development, Tang said.
	   During the visit, Jiang took every opportunity to remind Japan
of its wartime militarism. The Foreign Ministry spokesman echoed
those statements, saying ``a correct perspective'' on the war was
the foundation for China-Japan relations.
	   There had been speculation China was also dissatisfied with
Japan's vagueness on Taiwan. But Tang said Japan ``again made a
solemn commitment'' in recognizing Beijing as the sole government
of China and Taiwan as part of China.
	   China and Japan's past agreements spell out guidelines on
handling Taiwan, Tang said.
	   ``We hope Japan can honor its solemn commitments and will handle
the question of Taiwan properly and will implement its
commitments,'' he said.
	   The English-language China Daily, which is controlled by the
government as are all Chinese newspapers, used stronger language to
complain that Japan ``has not drawn adequate lessons from the war''
and was still influenced by right-wingers who have played down
atrocities committed by Japanese troops.
	   ``Until and unless Japan fully realizes its past misdirected
path and sincerely makes amends, people of the world, especially
former victims, cannot but eye it with suspicion and revulsion,''
the newspaper said Tuesday.
	   Tang said he had not seen the commentary and could not comment
about whether it reflected the government's views.

UEFA turns down Juventus request to arrive in Turkey Wednesday

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ Juventus could face disciplinary action
if it travels to Turkey on the day of its postponed Champions
League clash against Galatasaray, UEFA said Tuesday.
	   The European governing body said it sees no reason to exempt
Juventus from a UEFA rule under which teams must travel to match

China breaking up phone monopoly slowly
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China still plans to break up the country's
telephone monopoly but foreign investors can't expect a slice of
the fast-growing sector any time soon, government officials said
Tuesday.
	   Even with the eventual end of China Telecom's monopoly, senior
officials with the Ministry of Information Industry said conditions
were not ripe for foreign investors to operate in its highly
protected telecommunications services sector.
	   China Telecom towers over the huge market, serving most of the
110 million telephone subscribers. That network is set to grow to
170 million in two years. Mobile phone users alone are expected to
jump to 40 million, from 23 million, according to ministry figures.
	   China Telecom's breakup was signaled in March when the Communist
Party-led government ordered a restructuring of the industrial
ministries that once guided central planning but were deemed unfit
to regulate free markets. Ministries were told to end direct
control of businesses and nurture domestic competition.
	   Wang Jianzhou, head of planning for the nine-month-old Ministry
of Information Industry, said reforms to separate the ministry from
its flagship enterprise, China Telecom, are progressing, but he
declined to elaborate.
	   ``It is difficult now to give you a timetable,'' added Cheng
Guanghui, head of the ministry's general office.
	   According to state media reports and industry analysts, the
ministry has submitted plans to China's Cabinet, the State Council.
Some suggest breaking up China Telecom along geographical lines,
like the United States once did with AT&AMP;T. Others would slice off
services _ paging, cellular, long-distance _ into different
companies.
	   One industry insider, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
regulators are already spinning off services, such as China
Telecom's paging business, which will form the core of a new
company, Guoxin, to be announced in the next few weeks.
	   The insider said the main point of contention between the
ministry and the State Council was over who would ultimately own
the controlling shares in China Telecom.
	   The ministry has good reason to guard China Telecom. It is one
of China's ``most profitable national companies,'' in the words of
the state-run China Daily.
	   A previous government attempt to create a competitor to China
Telecom has failed. The anemic China Unicom has only 1 million
mobile phone subscribers and offers limited fixed-line phone
service.
	   Regulators earlier this year closed one loophole China Unicom
used to raise money from foreign companies. To circumvent a ban on
foreigners operating or owning telecommunications services, some
foreign companies formed ventures with Chinese companies, which in
turn invested in the sector.
	   Sprint and China Unicom used this so-called
``China-China-Foreign'' arrangement to set up a dlrs 30 million
fixed-line telephone network in Tianjin city last year.
	   The clampdown on so-called ``China-China-Foreign'' ventures and
a directive to Chinese companies to buy domestic has already drawn
criticism from the United States as an example of intensifying
protectionism by Beijing.
	   Ministry planner Wang said such investments violated Chinese
regulations and all such projects were under review.

Repairs at Chernobyl nuclear reactor delayed over energy shortages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Energy shortages have forced Ukraine to
postpone repairs on the sole operational reactor at the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant by at least two weeks, officials said Tuesday.
	   Chernobyl's reactor No. 3 would be operating until Dec. 15
before energy authorities decide whether to stop it, a spokesman
with the state nuclear energy company Energoatom said.
	   Ukraine's Nuclear Regulation Administration earlier this month
ordered the reactor be shut down Tuesday, warning that some safety
equipment was reaching the end of its operational life and needed
to be upgraded or replaced.
	   There have been frequent malfunctions at the reactor despite
lengthy repairs between July, 1997 and May, 1998. Anther Chernobyl
reactor was destroyed in a 1986 explosion and fire, the world's
worst nuclear accident.
	   However, the Energy Ministry has repeatedly protested the order
to shut down the working reactor, saying it was needed until the
spring to ensure enough electricity for the winter months.
	   Energoatom warned Monday that the shutdown of the Chernobyl
reactor would force energy authorities to cut off entire regions in
Ukraine to make up for the energy loss.
	   Ukraine faces a huge energy deficit this winter because
conventional energy plants, collectively owed more than dlrs 1
billion by consumers, can't afford enough fuel to satisfy the
demand for electricity and heat.
	   Thousands of towns and villages in Ukraine already go without
electricity for several hours every day as temperatures throughout
much of the country have sunk below minus 15 C (5 F), causing a
sharp increase in energy consumption.
	   Ukrainian officials hope that three of five other nuclear
reactors currently undergoing repairs would be restarted by Dec.
15, which would allow them to stop the Chernobyl reactor. Ukraine's
five nuclear power plants operate 14 reactors.
	   Western nations have long demanded the shutdown of the working
Chernobyl reactor amid growing worries over its safety. Reactor No.
3 has been Chernobyl's only working reactor since 1996.

Brother heads home, says he will reject government post

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
half-brother returned home on Tuesday after telling a Jordanian
newspaper he does not want a new government post so that he can
spend more time with his children.
	   Barzan al-Tikriti crossed the Jordanian border into Iraq earlier
in the day, Iraqi diplomats and Jordanian border officials said.
	   Al-Tikriti had been expected to leave earlier, but the Iraqi
diplomats said he delayed his departure by two days to see friends
in Jordan. They spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Al-Tikriti, 46, who headed Iraq's mission to the United Nations
in Geneva for a decade, was among 30 Iraqi ambassadors and
diplomats recalled to Baghdad over the summer.
	   There had been recurring rumors from Iraqi exiles that he was
seeking to defect to the opposition.
	   But he told reporters on arrival here from Switzerland on Sunday
that he had no political differences with Saddam and that he had
delayed his departure from Switzerland because his wife, Ahlam, was
being treated for breast cancer. She died in Switzerland last
month.
	   There had been reports al-Tikriti would be named to a Cabinet
post after his return to Baghdad. He previously was a director of
Iraqi intelligence.
	   In an interview with Jordan's Al-Arab Al-Yawm newspaper
published on Tuesday, al-Tikriti said he was ``not promised any
post and I do not wish that.''
	   He added: ``The only thing I hope from the bottom of my heart is
that President Saddam will absolve me from responsibilities because
I'm in a tragic mental state and I will not be able to carry out
the minimum requirements of any post.''
	   The daily quoted him as saying that he left his children in
Switzerland to continue their educations and that he plans to
``spend more time with them since they need me more in view of the
death of their mother.''
	   He is believed to have six children.
	   Al-Tikriti repeated his scathing attack on the Western media,
saying it had ``fabricated'' reports that he supervised the
transfer of contraband arms to Baghdad and that he later fell out
with Saddam and retained billions of dollars of the president's
private funds abroad.
	   ``This is silly,'' he said. ``Saddam is a reputable man and his
psychological and ideological makeup makes it impossible for him to
think about these things.''
	   He added: ``He does not have any funds or property, neither in
nor outside Iraq.''
	   He scoffed at U.S. effort to shore up the Iraqi opposition to
try to overthrow Saddam.
	   ``They are a bunch of incompetent groups,'' he said. ``I don't
understand how a country like the United States, which claims
responsibility for international peace and security, allows itself
to say it is determined to change a legitimate leadership in a way
that is not acceptable to the Iraqi people.''

President begins new consultations to select premier

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ President Emile Lahoud began a fresh
round of consultations with Parliament on Tuesday in search of a
new premier after incumbent Prime Minister Rafik Hariri bowed out.
	   Lahoud first met for about 15 minutes with former Prime Minister
Salim Hoss, a member of the parliament who is widely expected to be
asked by the president to form a new government.
	   Lahoud then began consulting members of the 128-seat Parliament,
who under Lebanon's constitution make recommendations on the
premier to the president.
	   Hariri's Cabinet has been serving in a caretaker capacity since
Lahoud was inaugurated as Lebanon's new president last week.
	   Lahoud began the latest round of consultations, which are
expected to last two days, after Hariri declined to name a new
Cabinet following an earlier round of consultations with
Parliament.
	   Hariri's move could be a ploy to gain more power as a new
government is formed, but the crisis atmosphere generated by his
possible departure could affect Lebanon's economic recovery.
	   Central bank officials on Monday tried to calm fears about a run
on the Lebanese pound by announcing that the bank was ready to
intervene with its foreign currency reserves, the state-run
National News Agency reported. It added that the money markets
remained stable.
	   In the initial round, Parliament members gave Hariri a majority.
But that was far short of the near-unanimous backing he received in
three previous mandates since 1992.
	   Hariri, 53, a business tycoon who launched Lebanon's
multi-billion dollar reconstruction from the devastation of the
1975-90 civil war, said Monday in an interview with CNN that he was
no longer a candidate.
	   He demanded that Lahoud admit that he acted unconstitutionally
by allowing 31 Parliament deputies to authorize him to name a prime
minister instead of naming one themselves.
	   Lahoud, 62, is an army commander who wants to assert his
authority at the start of his six-year presidential term. Hariri
virtually has had a free hand in running the country since he
became premier six years ago under former President Elias Hrawi.
	   Several Parliament members who had named Hariri as their choice
for prime minister were expected to name Hoss in the new round of
consultations.
	   Salim Hoss, 69, a U.S.-educated economist, served four times as
prime minister since 1976, including a term in 1988 during the
darkest days of Lebanon's civil war.

China calls for release of fishermen captured near disputed islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China on Tuesday called for the immediate release
of 20 Chinese fishermen arrested by a Philippine navy patrol near
the disputed Spratly Islands.
	   The Chinese government is very concerned, views the detentions
as illegal and wants Manila to take measures to avoid such arrests
in the future, Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang said at a
twice-weekly briefing.
	   The Philippine patrol arrested 20 Chinese fishermen and seized
their six boats on Sunday near the Alicia Annie Reef, which is
claimed by both the Philippines and China.
	   A Philippine navy officer, Maj. Romulo Gualdrapa, said Monday
they were arrested for illegally fishing in Philippine territory
and using sodium cyanide to catch fish in violation of a Philippine
law that bans the practice.
	   Cyanide is added to sea water by some fishermen to stun fish so
they can be caught and sold alive to restaurants. Cyanide kills
many other fish and destroys coral reefs.
	   The arrests were the latest in a series of recent incidents
between Manila and Beijing over territories in the South China Sea.
	   The Spratlys are believed to be rich in oil, gas and minerals.
China, Vietnam and Taiwan claim all of the Spratlys, while the
Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei claim parts of the chain.

Government leases U.S. F-16 fighters but defers Aussie frigate
</HEADLINE>
purchase &QL; 
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Bowing to public opposition, the
government Tuesday deferred buying a third Australian naval
frigate, but leased 28 U.S. fighter planes and authorized a major
army equipment upgrade.
	   The decision surprised some observers, convinced Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley's minority National Party government would push ahead
with the frigate purchase despite opinion polls showing 75 percent
of voters opposed the deal.
	   Shipley announced the replacement of the 30-year old Skyhawk
fleet with 28 F-16 fighter planes leased from the United States for
200 million New Zealand dollars (US dlrs 105 million), and that
government will upgrade the army with 500 more men and re-equip it
with modern equipment at a cost of 500 million New Zealand dollars
(US dlrs 265 million).
	   The Labor opposition cast immediate doubt on the F-16 fighter
deal, warning it might not honor any agreement between New Zealand
and the United States to lease the planes if it wins government.
	   A general election is due before November 1999, and Labor
presently holds a 16 percent lead in opinion polls.
	   The re-equipment decisions triggered the resignation of
independent legislator Deborah Morris, trimming the government's
majority to 61-59 in the 120-seat Parliament.
	   Shipley and Defense Minister Max Bradford said they had decided
against the Australian frigate purchase for cost reasons.
	   But Shipley said the government had also ``listened to New
Zealand'' and taken into account public opinion against a further
frigate purchase. Two were bought by a Labor government in the late
1980s.
	   The decision not to buy a third frigate leaves a question mark
over whether New Zealand will retain a three-frigate navy once its
ageing Leander-class frigate (the ``Canterbury'') is decommissioned
in about 2005.
	   A decision will need to be made by 2002, making the only choices
secondhand frigates from Australia, the United States or Britain.
	   Bradford said the government's top priority had been to re-equip
the army. He had not been able to convince Cabinet colleagues that
the government could afford to upgrade the army while also buying
another frigate and leasing the F-16 fighters.

Australia's defense minister visits Thailand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Defense Minister John Moore left
Australia Tuesday for his first visit to Thailand.
	   Moore took his new post after this country's Oct. 3 elections.
	   His latest visit closely follows another he made to Indonesia.
	   Moore said before leaving that he had accepted an invitation
from Thailand's Prime Minister and Defense Minister Chuan Leek Pai
to attend the King's birthday celebrations.
	   Moore said Thailand is one of Australia's most active regional
defense partners.
	   ``The defense relationship encompasses frequent high level
visits, combined exercises, a large training program, personnel
attachments and joint
	   projects,'' Moore said.
	   He will return to Australia on Thursday.

Israeli opposition leader hires Clinton aide for campaign
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The political consultant who engineered Bill
Clinton's come-from-behind victory in the 1992 presidential race
hopes to do the same for the Israeli opposition leader.
	   Campaign adviser James Carville will arrive in Israel next month
to talk strategy with Ehud Barak, a former armed forces chief of
staff and leader of the opposition Labor Party.
	   Barak has failed to pull ahead in the polls despite the repeated
scandals that have tarnished Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Carville will work with pollster Stanley Greenberg and media
specialist Robert Shrom.
	   The three have contributed to the successful campaigns of
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder, said Barak spokeswoman Aliza Goren.
	   ``We have hired this team because we are very serious about
winning the elections,'' Goren said.
	   She said Israeli Labor Party officials have also met with their
counterparts in Germany and Britain to look at campaign strategies
there.
	   The next elections are scheduled for 2000, but Netanyahu's
coalition is shaky and there is a growing possibility that a vote
might be held as early as spring or summer.
	   Netanyahu has relied on his own U.S. consultant, Arthur
Finkelstein, who helped him narrowly defeat incumbent Prime
Minister Shimon Peres in the 1996 elections.
	   Finkelstein has worked for some of America's top conservative
politicians, including Sen. Jesse Helms, a Republican from North
Carolina, and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, a New York Republican.
	   Netanyahu has flown the elusive Finkelstein to Israel several
times to advise him in times of political crises.
	   In a heated debate in parliament in July, Barak accused
Netanyahu of being politically out of touch and having to rely on
American spin doctors for direction.
	   ``Rather than calling Finkelstein, we should think for ourselves
and take the path of peace and security,'' Barak said at the time.
	   In his response, Netanyahu said Barak also relied on U.S.
advisers and mentioned Greenberg by name.

Romania marks 80 years since reunification with Transylvania
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ In a giant military parade which cost
this impoverished country a fortune, Romania on Tuesday celebrated
80 years since it was reunited with Transylvania.
	   In freezing weather, some 20,000 people and military troops
gathered outside the giant palace built by former communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in celebrations with a distinctly
military feel.
	   But the festivities, designed to give the country a boost, were
marred by splits among Romania's political parties and criticism
that 3 billion lei (dlrs 300,000) spent to mark the day was
breaking the impoverished country's budget.
	   The average monthly wage in Romania is 1.2 million lei (dlrs
120).
	   The nationalist opposition boycotted the celebrations in the
capital and traveled to Alba Iulia in Transylvania where the
original reunification took place in 1918.
	   Romania was awarded Transylvania and the northern region of
Bukovina as part of the spoils of World War I. British-born Queen
Marie fought Romania's case to regain lost territory.
	   In Bucharest President Emil Constantinescu, flanked by the head
of the Orthodox Church, took off his fur hat as the temperature
hovered at -4 C (25F) in respect for the military parade of 4,000
soldiers. Priests officiated a service and the ceremony was
broadcast live on state-run and private television.
	   ``This celebration will have a positive impact on the young
people in the army,'' said Lt. Col. Ion Petrescu as Puma
helicopters and Hercules airplanes buzzed overhead.
	   For the past week, helicopters and airplanes practicing for the
ceremony have flown low over the capital and tanks have rolled past
Ceausescu's palace, which now houses the parliament.

UEFA turns down Juventus request to arrive in Turkey Wednesday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ Juventus could face disciplinary action
if it travels to Turkey on the day of its postponed Champions
League clash against Galatasaray, UEFA said Tuesday.
	   The European governing body said it sees no reason to exempt
Juventus from a UEFA rule under which teams must travel to match
venues by the day before a game.
	   Juventus had asked UEFA for permission to arrive in Istanbul
Wednesday, in a concession to players' misgivings over traveling to
Turkey in the light of the country's political tensions with Italy.
	   The match is going ahead after a one-week postponement by UEFA
over security concerns. Tension has declined since then.
	   UEFA said it sees ``no valid reason to grant an exception'' to
competition rules which state teams must arrive at the match venue
no later than the previous evening.
	   ``The clause is considered to be essential in order to allow
smooth preparations for the match, in particular for the visiting
team,'' UEFA said in a statement.
	   In a reply to the Juventus request, UEFA said ``it will be the
club's own decision to adhere to the regulations or not.''
	   If the Italian team travels Wednesday, ``we would draw your
attention to the fact that the matter would then be submitted to
UEFA's disciplinary bodies,'' it added.

Kremlin says Yeltsin improving, still in hospital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more comments from Yeltsin's aide in new three
final grafs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin is feeling better, but is
still spending part of the day in a hospital bed as he continues to
be treated for pneumonia, officials said Tuesday.
	   A Kremlin spokesman said the president was doing limited
paperwork and there were no plans for any meetings or visitors. He
did not say how much longer Yeltsin would remain in the government
hospital where he has been for 10 days.
	   Yeltsin's first deputy chief of staff Oleg Sysuyev said on
Tuesday that the president is expected to return to work at the
Kremlin ``in the nearest time.'' ``Doctors are having trouble
keeping the president in the hospital,'' Sysuyev said at a news
conference.
	   The 67-year-old leader is known as a restless patient who
sometimes ignores the advice of his doctors.
	   Yeltsin met his chief-of-staff Valentin Yumashev in the hospital
Monday and was briefed on government and national affairs.
	   Russian television showed brief footage of Yeltsin, dressed in a
white shirt and dark cardigan and looking pale, listening intently
to his aide and nodding periodically. Like most footage of Yeltsin
released in recent weeks, Monday's tape didn't contain any sound of
the president speaking.
	   Yeltsin's repeated illnesses and his infrequent public
appearances have raised concerns about his ability to lead the
country _ now mired in its worst economic crisis since the 1991
Soviet collapse _ through the end of his term in mid-2000.
	   Sysuyev reiterated on Tuesday that Yeltsin will concentrate on
political matters, leaving day-to-day management of economic
matters to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov. ``You shouldn't think
that the president and his office aren't taking part and
controlling the economic developments, such as preparing next
year's budget and tax reform,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin has remained out of public view throughout the latest
economic crisis that hit in mid-August, further eroding his sagging
popularity.
	   ``It's known that the president now doesn't have sufficiently
high popularity, to put it mildly,'' Sysuyev said, according to the
Interfax news agency. He insisted, however, that the president
continues to play a stabilizing role in Russian society, blunting
antagonism between different political forces.

Greeks worry that Cyprus missiles could shoot down EU goals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRIAN MURPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ When Cyprus ordered surface-to-air
missiles, it was hoping to enhance its security against its
longtime foe, Turkey.
	   Suddenly, however, it's Cyprus' main ally _ Greece _ that is
feeling nervous about introducing new firepower to the divided
island.
	   Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides last week rebuffed an offer
by Greek officials to place the S-300 anti-aircraft missiles in a
less provocative site, the Greek island of Crete.
	   Now Athens is growing edgy that a potential military showdown in
Cyprus over the missiles could knock Athens from its real battle:
conquering its fiscal troubles and joining the European Union
single currency club.
	   ``The last thing Greece wants is anything interfering with its
EU goals,'' said Constantine Karistinos, a researcher at the
Institute for International Relations, an Athens-based think tank.
	   Deciding the fate of the Russian-made missiles has accomplished
an unusual feat in the politics of the region: separating rhetoric
from reality.
	   Greece has always been ready with strong words of support for
Greek Cypriots, who ordered the missiles in 1996 in response to
Turkey's purchase of long-range American artillery. Turkey has
warned it could use its powerful military to take out the proposed
missiles.
	   Turkey maintains about 30,000 troops in the northern third of
the Mediterranean island, divided since 1974 when Turkey invaded
following a short-lived coup by backers of union with Greece. Only
Turkey recognizes the breakaway northern republic.
	   Greece formed a defense pact with Cyprus in 1993 and inaugurated
a Greek-built military air base this year.
	   But back in Greece, Premier Costas Simitis was marshaling all
his forces for the single currency quest. Greece failed to meet the
fiscal guidelines on the first round and Simitis has made entry by
2001 his main focus.
	   His Socialist party has shown unprecedented resolve against
waves of labor protests and strikes. Market analysts and EU
officials have recently encouraged Simitis' efforts to tame
inflation and reduce state debt.
	   ``Now we're being trapped by the Cypriots,'' cried political
commentator Aris Tolios on Flash radio.
	   In financial terms, a costly military mobilization to support
Cyprus could set back Greece's austerity goals. There also could be
a high psychological cost for Greece, some experts say.
	   ``It could deflect the focus from the EU to Cyprus just when the
Greek government needs to fully concentrate on the single currency
drive,'' said Karistinos on Monday.
	   The United States and EU also have urged Cyprus to cancel or
delay the deployment. U.S. negotiator Richard Holbrooke will try to
restart Cyprus talks during a trip through the region in December.
	   Last week, the Simitis government unsuccessfully lobbied Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides to accept the Crete alternative for the
missiles _ which are still sitting in a Russian warehouse and are
now not expected to be delivered until early next year.
	   But Clerides apparently fears the political fallout from the
perception of backing down to Turkish demands.
	   ``We cannot lift up our arms and surrender whenever we face a
threat,'' said Cypriot Socialist leader Vassos Lyssarides, whose
party has two members in the cabinet.
	   In Greece, the Cypriot snub has put the flame on simmering ill
feelings. Many Greeks privately complain about what they consider a
lopsided alliance, especially considering Cyprus' galloping
economy. But such grumbling is rarely voiced publicly out of
respect for their mutual mistrust of Turkey.
	   The missile dispute may change the rules.
	   The Eleftheros Typos newspaper reported that Foreign Minister
Theodoros Pangalos berated Cyprus' defense minister, Giannakis
Omirou, for comments about Greece's efforts to move the missiles to
Crete.
	   ``The ... missiles are turning into a wound for Greece,'' the
Vradini newspaper commented.

Adelaide team folds in NRL
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Australia's National Rugby League
competition will shrink from 20 teams in 1998 to at most 18 in 1999
with Tuesday's announcement of the demise of the Adelaide Rams.
	   The Gold Coast Chargers were also tipped to close, which would
leave 17 teams next year following the previously announced St
George-Illawarra merger.
	   For the past month there had been mounting speculation that the
Australian Rugby League-backed Chargers would be axed along with
the Super League-created Rams as part of the NRL's bid to reduce to
premiership to 14 teams by 2000.
	   Adelaide chairman Peter Wylie announced late Tuesday that News
Limited had decided to stop funding the club it created for the
breakaway competition that operated in 1997. (djp)

UN inspectorate returns to full strength
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations has brought its
complement of 120 weapons inspectors in Iraq up to full strength, a
U.N. official said Tuesday.
	   The inspectors are ready to resume the intrusive searches of
suspected arms sites that the Iraqi authorities tried to halt on
Aug. 5 when they refused to provide the necessary escorts.
	   ``We are back at full strength as we were before the latest
crisis and we are ready to carry out all inspections,'' the
spokeswoman for the U.N. inspectors, Caroline Cross, said in
Baghdad.
	   The United Nations evacuated its weapons experts on Nov. 11 as
the United States and Britain prepared to launch air strikes to
force Iraq to reverse its Oct. 31 decision to cease all cooperation
with the inspectors.
	   Iraq relented Nov. 14, and inspectors began returning to Baghdad
three days later. The first batches of inspectors to return have
been checking monitoring equipment installed at sites where Iraq
previously worked on its program of missiles and weapons of mass
destruction.
	   But lately the United Nations has been flying in visiting teams
of inspectors whose mission is to search sites where Iraq is
suspected of hiding evidence of its banned weapons program. It is
these inspections that have previously brought Iraq and the United
Nations to the brink of a showdown.
	   ``We expect to see more visiting teams, and we will be real busy
for the next few weeks,'' Cross told The Associated Press.
	   Cross said teams of inspectors went out to work at sites
Tuesday, as they have every day since Nov. 18. Iraq's National
Monitoring Directorate, which follows the teams' activity, has said
12 teams inspected 12 sites on Monday.
	   Richard Butler, the chief U.N. weapons inspectors, has said he
expects to report to the U.N. Security Council on the degree of
Iraq's cooperation in two or three weeks.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
chemical, nuclear and biological weapons, long-range missiles and
the programs to build them before the Security Council will lift
the sweeping sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   The recent dispute over inspections brought the Gulf to the
brink of war for the third time in a year. The United States has
left an armada in the Gulf to make sure that the Iraqi authorities
honor their Nov. 14 pledge to cooperate fully with the U.N.
experts.
	   In a letter to the Security Council on Monday, Iraqi Foreign
Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf complained the United States was
threatening his country.
	   The U.S. Congress has pledged dlrs 97 million to Iraqi dissident
groups.
	   The United States was not allowed ``to support opposition by
supplying them with money and other means to overthrow the
government,'' al-Sahhaf said in his letter, which Iraqi newspapers
published Tuesday.

Euro-zone nations break deadlock over international representation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ With just a month to go before the
launch of the euro, European Union finance ministers reached an
11th-hour agreement Tuesday on who should speak for the
single-currency bloc on the world stage.
	   The agreement resolved months of deadlock between big and small
euro-zone nations over who should represent the 11-nation currency
bloc at the G-7 group of world economic powers and other
international meetings.
	   Under the compromise, the euro-zone's three existing G-7 nations
- Germany, France and Italy - keep their seats and will take turns
to represent the bloc. Details of the deal were sketchy but it
appeared that smaller nations would also get a chance to set at G-7
meetings, when they holds the six-month euro-zone presidency.
	   That means German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine will speak
for the euro-zone for the first six months of 1999, to be joined by
his Finnish counterpart Sauli Niniisto for second half of the year.
	   The European Central Bank, which will oversee monetary policy in
the euro-zone, will replace national central banks at G-7 meetings.
The EU's executive Commission will offer only ``technical
assistance'' to the European delegation.
	   The launch of the euro as the shared currency of 11 EU nations
will create a single bloc that will rival the United States and
Japan as a global economic power.
	   But while U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Japanese
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa can always get on the phone to
discuss the world's economic situation, nobody was sure who to call
when they wanted to speak to the euro-bloc.
	   The rotating system of euro-zone presidencies should go some way
to meeting that need. The deal is set to be confirmed by EU leaders
at their year-end summit next week in Vienna, Austria.
	   The issue had provoked a rift between the EU's existing G-7
members who refused to relinquish their seats, and smaller
euro-zone nations who demanded some sort of representation. There
was no immediate reaction to the deal from other G-7 nations - the
United States, Japan and Canada. Britain, the EU's fourth G-7
members is staying out of the euro.
	   Later Tuesday, the ministers were set to review plans to close
tax loopholes that cost national treasuries billions of dollars in
lost revenue. Officials played down talk of a rift between Britain
and Germany over tax plans.
	   British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown criticized
recent ``scare stories'' in the London press about alleged German
plans to impose EU-wide taxes. However, he repeated British
opposition to any such plans.
	   ``Some people want to argue that there is an inevitability about
a single currency leading to a single tax rate,'' Brown told the
BBC. ``That is not the way that I see it.''
	   Ministers were to consider a report by a panel of EU tax experts
which identified 85 measures used by EU member nations that may
violate the Union's new code of conduct on business taxation.
	   The reports lists the ``potentially harmful'' tax breaks that
span all 15 of the EU member nations except Austria. The code of
conduct commits EU nations to avoid measures that lure investment
from their neighbors by offering favorable tax rates to foreign
companies.
	   A further proposal to impose an EU-wide 20 percent minimum tax
on savings is likely to fall foul of opposition from Britain and
Luxembourg.

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Like ambivalent boxing judges, Quebec voters
gave their combative politicians a split decision: the
pro-independence government gets another term in power, but with
support so tepid that a secession bid is unlikely any time soon.
	   The separatist Parti Quebecois retained a large legislative
majority in Monday's provincial election, winning 75 of the 125
seats to earn a new term of up to five years.
	   But the anti-separatist Quebec Liberal Party, though winning
only 48 seats, received 44 percent of the popular vote to 43
percent for the Parti Quebecois.
	   As a result, Liberal leader Jean Charest sounded more buoyant in
his remarks to supporters than Premier Lucien Bouchard, the
separatist leader, did in his victory speech.
	   ``The result tonight ... reflects the fact that the people of
Quebec, like the people of all Canada, want this country of ours to
work and be a success,'' said Charest, who will serve as opposition
leader in the provincial legislature.
	   The split decision stems from the geographical distribution of
political support in Quebec.
	   Anti-separatist support is concentrated in about 40 districts,
mostly around multi-ethnic Montreal, where the Liberals can rack up
huge victory margins. The separatists, whose backing comes almost
entirely fron Quebec's French-speaking majority, are competitive in
a much larger number of districts spread across the province.
	   Bouchard, 59, had campaigned on the pledge that he would _ if
returned to power _ call for a referendum on seceding from Canada
whenever he felt conditions were right for a separatist victory.
	   But with only 43-percent support for his party, Bouchard is
likely to shelve any immediate push for a referendum and
concentrate instead on policies that will build public confidence.
	   ``There is no question that this vote was a vote to elect a
government, not a vote to determine the future of Quebec or the
future of the country,'' said Brian Tobin, the premier of
Newfoundland.
	   ``I wouldn't expect with these results that Mr. Bouchard will be
thinking of a referendum any time soon, if ever.''
	   Bouchard paid tribute to his opponents' determination and
pledged to work with them on policy matters. But he also promised
to work for the ``winning conditions'' that would make independence
possible eventually.
	   ``Our first priority is to advance Quebec ... to push it farther
toward its destiny,'' he said.
	   The federal government kept a low profile during the 33-day
campaign, not wanting to undercut Charest in a province where many
francophones are traditionally wary of federal intentions.
	   Early Tuesday, after the results were known, Prime Minister Jean
Chretien assured Bouchard of cooperation in helping strengthen
Quebec's economy and social services.
	   ``But when he talks about bringing together his famous winning
conditions, which he refuses to reveal, to hold another referendum
on separation, he should know we will defend our country,''
Chretien said.
	   As a personality, the charismatic Bouchard is by far the most
popular politician in Quebec. But many Quebeckers who voted for his
party are not keen on secession; recent polls indicated about 70
percent didn't want another referendum.
	   One of the most notable results of the election was the strong
showing of Democratic Action, the No. 3 party that drew 12 percent
of the vote behind its 28-year-old leader, Mario Dumont. The party,
which appeals to many young voters, favors greater autonomy for
Quebec but stops short of advocating outright secession.
	   ``Mr. Bouchard's mandate is clear _ to provide good government
and represent Quebec's interests,'' Dumont said. ``He was not
elected to do a referendum on sovereignty. Quebeckers want
constitutional peace.''
	   The separatists have lost two previous secession referendums, by
a big margin in 1980 and a narrow margin in 1995.
	   Bouchard is intent on avoiding a third defeat, and won a power
struggle with party hard-liners earlier this year by insisting he
would call another referendum only if opinion polls showed the
separatists would win.
	   About 80 percent of the 5.2 million eligible voters cast ballots
in Monday's election, high by North American standards but down
from 93 percent for the 1995 referendum.
	   About 83 percent of Quebec's 7.4 million people are French
speakers. The rest are divided among English-speakers with
long-term roots in Canada and more recently arrived immigrants from
southern Europe, Asia and elsewhere.
	   The long-term crusade for Quebec independence stems from a
feeling among many French Quebeckers that their culture is
different from the rest of Canada, plus a yearning to manage their
own affairs and have their own national symbols.

Australia defies UN by giving uranium project green light
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's conservative government
defied a U.N. body's declaration that Kakadu National Park is a
World Heritage area by declaring it will allow uranium mining at
Jabiluka within the park.
	   The U.N. Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization did
accept a plea from the Australian government that it be given six
months to respond to the panel's ruling.
	   But the panel recommended that all mining activities should
cease in the meantime. It said the mine, which could process 19.5
million metric tons of uranium ore over its 28-year life, could
damage the environment.
	   The local Mirrar Aboriginal people have been among the most
vocal critics of the project, which although actually inside the
Northern Territory national park, has been technically excluded as
an enclave within it.
	   Environment Minister Robert Hill said he would compile a
comprehensive rebuttal of the UNESCO report, which he has described
as superficial and unbalanced.
	   But he would not tell uranium miner Energy Resources of
Australia, which is still 18 months away from mining the first
uranium and is still doing preparatory work, to comply with the
UNESCO call.
	   ``We are quite satisfied with all the Australian processes for
approval of the mine,'' Hill said.
	   ``The mine is not in a world heritage listed area nor in a
national park and it will cause neither environmental nor cultural
damage,'' Hill said.
	   Hill said UNESCO's report, made after only a four-day visit to
the mine site, ignored the enormous body of evidence gathered over
18 years of mining at Ranger just 12 miles (20 km) from Jabiluka.
	   Australia's environmental groups reacted immediately to Hill's
announcement saying it would seriously damage Australia's
reputation.
	   Greens party Senator Bob Brown said, ``Even major uranium buyers
like France, Japan and the U.S. -- members of the World Heritage
Committee -- voted to stop this obscene mine.''
	   ``If Australia defies the world umpire on the World Heritage
Convention no treaty will be seen as safe,'' Brown added.
	   Environmentalists say reputable surveys show that 82 percent of
Australians oppose mining in areas like Kakadu.
	   They claim that the government's rebuttal of the UNESCO report
shows it to be both arrogant and out of touch with its own people
and the rest of the world.
	   Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles (31,200 sq. km.) of flood
plains and plateau on Australia's north coast, with waterfalls and
hundreds of animal species, including many that are rare or
endangered.
	   The park is one of a handful listed for both environmental and
cultural values. About 200,000 tourists visit the park every year.

Center-left governments clash with bankers on euro course

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Even before Europe's single currency
is launched, politicians are challenging the independence of the
central bank that will keep tabs on the new euro.
	   Germany's new leaders have led the campaign, demanding that the
European Central Bank, after it takes over monetary policy Jan. 1,
lower interest rates to spur economic growth and create more jobs.
	   The push reflects growing demands across the European Union for
a more hands-on approach to monetary policy as the euro launch
nears, and some fear the tussle between politicians and bankers
could damage the historic project.
	   The argument ``goes to the psychological roots of the euro'' _
its independence from political influence, German central banker
Ernst Welteke said recently.
	   ``This is a perilous venture in an untested vessel. How can the
passengers feel confident if the officers are so visibly squabbling
on the quarter deck?'' London's Financial Times asked in a recent
editorial.
	   The contest _ between the usual monetary goal of promoting low
inflation and the broader political goal of spurring job creation _
challenges the new central bank's guiding strategy: price stability
modeled on the successful German Bundesbank.
	   The U.S. Federal Reserve is caught in the same tug, though
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan stresses that the goal of
low unemployment can't be achieved unless the Fed keeps a vigilant
watch and is ready to boost interest rates at the first sign
inflation is accelerating.
	   The European debate shows how much the political landscape has
changed since the European Central Bank's mission was charted in
1992, when conservative, inflation-beating governments were in
power.
	   France and Germany, the twin engines of the monetary union, led
the charge for cutting deficits and reducing government spending to
create a stable environment for the euro. They were guided by the
1992 Maastricht Treaty, which outlined terms for the euro, ensuring
the independence of the European Central Bank.
	   Since then, the conservatives have been replaced by center-left
administrations more interested in creating jobs and less in
squeezing inflation. With the German election in September, nine of
the 11 countries adopting the euro now are ruled by the
center-left. A consensus is growing.
	   German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine has received support
from French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn in his campaign
for interest rate cuts. While Lafontaine boldly demands lower
interest rates, Strauss-Kahn was more reserved. He said it was
``not inconceivable'' that interest rates would be reduced in
France and in Germany in the near future.
	   But that position may be easing. Last week, German central
banker Hans Tietmeyer said he would not rule out the possibility of
lower interest rates in Germany before the end of the year. Such a
move could reduce the interest rate that the euro zone itself will
adopt Jan. 1.
	   Other European countries, while making no demands, have signaled
they share France and Germany's concerns. A recent EU summit in
Austria was devoted to finding ways to boost the continent's
economy, tackle unemployment _ stuck at 10.9 percent in the 11 euro
nations _ and prepare for the launch of a single currency.
Left-leaning finance ministers went even further in Brussels,
Belgium, recently, saying jobs creation should be a key element of
monetary policy.
	   ECB President Wim Duisenberg has in the last weeks traveled
around the world _ including stops in Dublin, Ireland, and New York
_ repeating the message that jobs creation is up to government
policy, not the central bank.
	   The central bank's job, he insists, is to keep inflation low and
prices stable.
	   With characteristic bluntness, Duisenberg has described cutting
interest rates to boost economic growth as ``entirely
counterproductive.'' It would, he says, lead to higher unemployment
by pushing up long-term interest rates, and could undermine the
benefits of price stability.
	   Politicians already are hinting that they may take another
approach to solve stubborn joblessness if the European central
bankers don't pitch in.
	   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said in his first major
policy speech after taking office in October that he may be forced
to increase government spending if the central bank won't help
stimulate economic growth.
	   After Schroeder's speech, Duisenberg warned that increased
spending would imperil a pact EU governments made promising to
slash budget deficits as part of efforts to forge a strong euro.

Chile presses Spain to stop Pinochet's extradition

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel
Insulza said Tuesday a Spanish judge's attempt to extradite Augusto
Pinochet has polarized his homeland, but does not pose a threat to
Chilean democracy.
	   Insulza began a round of talks Tuesday with Spanish officials,
attempting to convince them to drop the extradition request so
Pinochet can go home.
	   The foreign minister came here Monday after a four-day visit to
Britain, where he tried to persuade the Labor Party government not
to extradite the 83-year-old former dictator.
	   Insulza met Tuesday morning with Luis Lopez, Supreme Court vice
president and Juan Ignacio Barrero, president of the Senate, and
was scheduled to meet later in the day with Prime Minister Jose
Maria Aznar and Foreign Minister Abel Matutes.
	   ``Democratic stability in Chile is not at risk,'' Insulza said
after his meeting with Barrero, but urged a quick solution because
``it's affecting my country very much.''
	   Shortly after arriving in Madrid Monday, Insulza said that the
political climate in Spain would make a fair trial for Pinochet
impossible.
	   Insulza said Pinochet could be tried in Chile if he is allowed
to go home. Pinochet has immunity from prosecution in Chile.
Critics say that even if this were lifted he would appear before a
military court packed with his supporters.
	   Acting on a Spanish judge's request, police arrested Pinochet on
Oct. 16 at a London clinic where he was recuperating from an
operation. He faces charges of murder, torture and genocide in
Spain.
	   British Home Secretary Jack Straw has 10 more days to decide
whether to go ahead with extradition proceedings.
	   A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared at the hands of the police after Pinochet seized power
in a military coup that toppled democratically elected President
Salvador Allende.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ To critics, he's an arrogant elitist
who would rule Venezuela for the benefit of the rich.
	   But to supporters, Henrique Salas Romer is Venezuela's last hope
of saving democracy and the only candidate with a chance of
defeating former coup leader Hugo Chavez in Sunday's presidential
election.
	   Salas is banking on his reputation as an efficient executive who
as governor shook up the state of Carabobo by reducing corruption,
cutting costs and making a notoriously chaotic government run
smoothly.
	   ``I inaugurated a new way of doing politics in the country,''
Salas, 62, a political independent, told The Associated Press last
week aboard his campaign plane.
	   The race has polarized Venezuelans between the poor, who see
Chavez as a hero partly because of his tough anti-corruption talk,
and the middle- and upper-classes who fear he will impose a leftist
dictatorship.
	   Venezuela's political establishment has spent the last two weeks
scrambling to convince other candidates to quit the race to boost
Salas, who is in second place in polls.
	   Even his detractors acknowledge the one-time economics professor
made impressive improvements in Carabobo in the heart of
Venezuela's industrial belt.
	   At Puerto Cabello port, Salas slashed the payroll from 5,300 to
190 workers while boosting the amount of cargo handled from 4.5
million tons to 10 million tons a year.
	   He cracked down on widespread theft of medicines and equipment
at public hospitals, created the only police emergency telephone
system in Venezuela and computerized highway toll booths to keep
workers from stealing.
	   ``We collected more on the first day than in the entire month
before,'' said Abdon Vivas O'Connor, Salas' campaign manager and
the former head of the highway program.
	   Critics say many of Salas' programs such as airport improvements
mainly benefited the rich and failed to get at the root of problems
such as mass poverty and crime.
	   ``Salas Romer's project is for 10 percent of the population and
the other 90 percent gets left out,'' said Omar Meza Ramirez, a
Chavez adviser.
	   Salas says his administration built 18,000 subsidized houses,
helped slash infant mortality rates by 35 percent and created a
low-interest credit program for small-business owners.
	   He says he will implement the credit program nationwide if he
wins the presidency, double or triple the number of tourists who
visit Venezuela's Caribbean beaches, Andean mountains and Amazon
jungles, and slash the government's bloated payroll of 1.3 million
workers by at least half.
	   Salas is betting his strong ties with the United States also
will help him. He and three of his brothers attended prestigious
Lawrenceville prep school in New Jersey and then Yale.
	   Venezuela is the number one foreign supplier of oil to the
United States. Chavez has been denied a visa to enter that country
because of his 1992 coup attempt.
	   Over the weekend, Democratic Action, one of Venezuela's two
major traditional parties, dumped its candidate and threw its
support to Salas. And on Monday the other main party, COPEI,
followed suit, switching allegiance from Irene Saez, a former Miss
Universe running fourth in polls, to Salas.
	   Party leaders insist nothing less than Venezuela's democracy is
at stake.
	   ``I am a person that can unify the country,'' says Salas.
	   Yet Salas' detractors accuse him of having authoritarian
tendencies. Venezuela's national journalists' association recently
accused him of verbally abusing several reporters and pressuring TV
and newspaper owners to pull them off his campaign beat.
	   Salas denies the charge.
	   ``I don't think there are rights or lefts in today's world,'' he
said. ``Today's political fight is really between the efficient and
the inefficient, the honest and the dishonest, legitimacy against
illegitimacy.''

	   LUMBINI, Nepal (AP) _ Amid loud religious chants, hundreds of
monks and other worshippers gathered at the birthplace of the
Buddha Tuesday to begin the World Buddhist Conference.
	   Nepal's Crown Crince Dipendra inaugurated the two-day meeting by
unveiling a multicolored traditional flag at a religious ceremony.
	   ``Lumbini has now become the symbol of world peace and goodwill.
Everyone should make a pilgrimage to Lumbini at least once in their
life,'' said Nepal's Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala.
	   Monks from Nepal, neighboring India and nine other countries are
taking part in the conference.
	   ``This conference is important in the campaign for world peace
since Buddha was the first person to call for world peace,'' said
Sri Lankan Cultural Minister Laxman Jayakode.
	   The Buddha was born in Lumbini over 2,500 years ago. Lumbini is
about 200 kilometers (120 miles) southwest of Katmandu, the
Nepalese capital.

Most Asian shares lower, Hong Kong market plummets

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed sharply lower
Tuesday on the back of Wall Street's decline, with the key index in
Hong Kong tumbling for a third straight session.
	   Hong Kong's blue chip Hang Seng Index plummeted 4.1 percent as
the market digested a host of negative economic data as well as
Monday's 2.3 percent fall by the Dow Jones industrial average in
New York.
	   The Hang Seng closed below the psychologically important level
of 10,000 points to end at 9,975.85, down 426.47 points.
	   Traders are worried about Hong Kong's economy, which is
struggling through recession, said Michael Ng, dealing director at
Sassoon Securities.
	   Hong Kong's gross domestic product fell by 7 percent in the
third quarter, prompting the government to lower its economic
forecast a 5 percent contraction for 1998. Since that gloomy news
was announced Friday, the market has shed 7.1 percent.
	   Late Monday, the government reported its budget deficit for the
first seven months of the fiscal year had reached 50.16 billion
Hong Kong dollar (U.S. dlrs 6.43 billion).
	   That figure was well above the 21 billion Hong Kong dollar (dlrs
2.69 billion) deficit the government estimated for the fiscal year
that ends March 31.
	   Singapore shares also tumbled as investors took profits
following the slump on Wall Street. The Straits Times Index fell
3.4 percent, or 47.85 points, to close at 1,368.70.
	   In Tokyo, the Nikkei average of 225 selected issues fell 48.29
points, or 0.3 percent, to 14,835.41 after a 185.69-point fall
Monday.
	   Traders said the market reacted mildly to Wall Street's drop and
news that JDC, a financially troubled contractor, had filed for
legal protection from creditors.
	   ``Despite JDC's failure and the overnight drop in New York, the
market showed some resilience,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general
manager of the stock division at Chuo Securities.
	   Weighed down by the sharp slide on Wall Street overnight, the
U.S. dollar bought only 122.78 yen in late Tokyo trading on
Tuesday, 1.04 yen lower than the rate in Tokyo on Monday and also
below its late New York level of 123.26 yen.
	   Bucking the trend was the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange, where
share prices extended a recent rally, with the key index closing up
3.5 percent on what traders describe as buying spurred by year-end
window dressing.
	   At the close, the Malaysian market's key Composite Index rose
17.28 points to 518.75.
	   Elsewhere:
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower, dragged down by concerns over
the stability of Taiwan's banking sector and amid caution ahead of
legislative elections this weekend. The market's key Weighted Stock
Price Index rose 74.85 points, or 1.04 percent, to 7,102.37.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower, with the
index falling to a four-week low in reaction to the drop overnight
on Wall Street. The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 41.33
points, or 2.1 percent, to 1,950.01.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares tumbled as investors cashed in on
gains made in the past session after the decline in U.S. stocks.
The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 53.57 points, or
2.7 percent, to 1,921.79.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed generally lower after a
fall in New York stocks and lower commodity prices on the London
Metal Exchange. The All Ordinaries Index fell 39.1 points, or 1.4
percent, to 2,734.1.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed mixed. The Korea Composite Stock
Price Index fell 5.92 points, or 1.3 percent, to 445.96.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed 1.8 percent lower. The Stock
Exchange of Thailand index dropped 6.66 points to 356.16.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed mixed on late buying of some big
capitalization stocks. The Composite Index rose 1.464 points to
387.735.

German, French leaders call for job creation, steadying financial

markets &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with final declaration. &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   POTSDAM, Germany (AP) _ Germany and France agreed Friday that
fighting unemployment should be Europe's top priority, throwing
their weight behind a shift toward a left-leaning agenda among
European governments.
	   French and German leaders also called for tighter international
scrutiny of the financial world, including highly speculative
``hedge funds,'' seen as a way to counter economically damaging
swings in the markets.
	   In a joint declaration after a two-day German-French summit, the
leaders said a jobs creation pact is needed to offset years of
government austerity measures to get Europe ready for the single
currency, the euro, being launched Jan. 1.
	   They called for putting ``the fight against unemployment at the
center of European politics'' and urged member governments of the
European Union to set binding goals for putting their citizens back
to work.
	   The appeals bore the stamp of Germany's new Social Democratic
chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, hosting his first summit with
Germany's closest European partner since he won September
elections. Schroeder met both French President Jacques Chirac and
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin at Potsdam, outside Berlin.
	   ``On the threshold of the 21st century, we are determined to
deepen these relations in the interest of European unity, and to
give them fresh momentum,'' the declaration said.
	   Both sides agreed to push plans to merge European aerospace
industries to take on U.S. giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin,
though they didn't resolve the issue of French participation.
	   Schroeder told Chirac during the summit that he supports
bringing together the British and German industries first if France
doesn't join in from the start. He stressed, though, that the door
would be left open to the French.
	   The big European aircraft makers _ Daimler-Benz Aerospace,
British Aerospace and Aerospatiale _ agreed in principle in March
to seek a merger. Daimler-Benz Aerospace and British Aerospace are
in advanced talks on a two-way alliance, but one stumbling block to
Aerospatiale's early participation is that the aircraft maker is
still partly government-owned and progress toward full
privatization has been slow.
	   With the euro binding 11 European economies closer together than
ever before, the leaders pledged to seek common European policies
on taxes and workers' rights.
	   Schroeder called Monday for ``a new beginning'' in German-French
relations, Europe's most important partnership and traditionally
the engine behind the drive for postwar European unity.
	   Germany and France hold summits twice yearly, but this meeting
has special significance because of the euro's debut and Germany's
six-month EU presidency starting Jan. 1.
	   German demands to lower its contribution to the EU budget were
one of the summit's more thorny topics. But German deputy foreign
minister Guenter Verheugen said that the French showed ``great
understanding'' for Germany's pressure, which comes as the EU tries
to streamline its budget and administration to get ready for new
members from the former Soviet bloc.
	   Germany, the biggest contributor to the EU budget, annually pays
in 22 billion marks (dlrs 12 billion) more into EU coffers than it
gets out in funds.

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ The South Australian government will
explore opportunities in the Philippines that could involve water
management in provincial cities, South Australian state Premier
John Olsen said Tuesday.
	   Olsen, who met with former Philippines president Fidel Ramos,
said water management was a key focus for the South Australian
government and one in which it had the expertise to help the
Philippines.
	   ``There are 15 cities with a population of 1 million people in
the Philippines -- and Mr. Ramos today indicated to me that there
are opportunities for South Australia to become involved in water
management in those areas,'' Olsen said.
	   Olsen said a delegation of South Australia's Water Corp.
directors and executives are visiting the region this week.
	   ``The delegation will review first hand both the progress that
has been made to date in projects and key prospects in key
international markets -- which include the Philippines, Indonesia
and China,'' he said.

Election results signal Sonia Gandhi's political arrival
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NEELESH MISRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Recent provincial election results have
inspired new hope among members of the 112-year-old Congress party
and trumpeted the arrival of Sonia Gandhi on India's political
landscape, party officials and analysts said.
	   After years of waning influence and dwindling votes, India's
main opposition party pulverized the ruling Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata Party in crucial provincial elections in three
states last week.
	   The BJP lost power in New Delhi state, where the federal capital
is located, and the western desert state of Rajasthan _ two
longtime BJP strongholds _ and retained power in the central Madhya
Pradesh state, despite projections of a BJP victory.
	   Congress leaders said it was a clear victory for Sonia Gandhi,
the Italian-born widow of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi who is seen
by her admirers as India's prime minister-in-waiting.
	   ``She has certainly made a good start, considering the doubts
there were earlier,'' said B. G. Verghese of New Delhi's
independent Center for Policy Research. ``She has matured, she is a
much more confident leader ... with greater acceptability within
the party and greater credibility outside.''
	   Though the state balloting had no direct effect on the BJP's
hold on federal power, the results will weaken its standing _ and
its hold over its 19 coalition partners. Gandhi, though, has said
she would not make an immediate bid for power by pressing for a
parliamentary confidence vote.
	   Gandhi, who married into what was once India's most powerful
political family, is the first non-Indian since independence 50
years ago to lead the Congress. The party was founded in 1885 by a
British man.
	   Between her late husband, his mother, Indira Gandhi, and her
father, Jawaharlal Nehru, the dynasty led India for nearly four
decades of its 50 years since independence.
	   The BJP had shrugged off the influence of the 51-year-old Sonia
Gandhi when she stepped into politics early this year, dismissing
her as a ``foreigner.'' Sonia Gandhi is now an Indian citizen.
	   ``It's wrong to say she is formidable,'' said K.R. Malkani, a
BJP vice-president, told The Associated Press. He said the BJP lost
because of its own weaknesses, not Congress's strengths.
	   ``The way the government failed to control prices, the way
infighting went on in the party _ I think that's more responsible
for the defeat,'' he said.
	   Thousands of voters heard Sonia Gandhi campaign last month and
during the federal election earlier this year. She slowly read
speeches in Hindi, India's national language, written in Roman
script.
	   She wears a traditional Indian sari, draping the end over the
head as tradition-minded women do to show respect for their elders.
	   During the campaign, she targeted rises in the price of several
food grains and vegetables, and the BJP's attempt to inject its
Hindu nationalist thought into the country's education system.

Brother heads home, says he will reject government post

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
half-brother returned home on Tuesday after telling a Jordanian
newspaper he does not want a new government post.
	   Barzan al-Tikriti, who said he wants to spend more time with his
children, crossed the Jordanian border into Iraq earlier in the
day, Iraqi diplomats and Jordanian border officials said.
	   Al-Tikriti had been expected to leave earlier, but the Iraqi
diplomats said he delayed his departure by two days to see friends
in Jordan. They spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Al-Tikriti, 46, who headed Iraq's mission to the United Nations
in Geneva for a decade, was among 30 Iraqi ambassadors and
diplomats recalled to Baghdad over the summer.
	   There had been recurring rumors from Iraqi exiles that he was
seeking to defect to the opposition.
	   But he told reporters on arrival here from Switzerland on Sunday
that he had no political differences with Saddam and that he had
delayed his departure from Switzerland because his wife, Ahlam, was
being treated for breast cancer. She died in Switzerland last
month.
	   There had been reports al-Tikriti would be named to a Cabinet
post after his return to Baghdad. He previously was a director of
Iraqi intelligence.
	   In an interview with Jordan's Al-Arab Al-Yawm newspaper
published on Tuesday, al-Tikriti said he was ``not promised any
post and I do not wish that.''
	   He added: ``The only thing I hope from the bottom of my heart is
that President Saddam will absolve me from responsibilities because
I'm in a tragic mental state and I will not be able to carry out
the minimum requirements of any post.''
	   The daily quoted him as saying that he left his children in
Switzerland to continue their educations and that he plans to
``spend more time with them since they need me more in view of the
death of their mother.''
	   He is believed to have six children.
	   Al-Tikriti repeated his scathing attack on the Western media,
saying it had ``fabricated'' reports that he supervised the
transfer of contraband arms to Baghdad and that he later fell out
with Saddam and retained billions of dollars of the president's
private funds abroad.

Shell blames sabotage, attacks for oil pipeline shutdown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Shell Oil has shut down sections of a key
crude oil pipeline in southern Nigeria after workers trying to seal
a leak were attacked by stone-throwing villagers, company officials
said Tuesday.
	   Officials believe the leak was the result of sabotage.
	   Five flow stations have been closed between oil wells and an
export terminal in the coastal town of Bonny in the oil-rich
southwestern Niger River delta, a company spokesman said on
condition of anonymity.
	   The leak was discovered on Friday and several efforts to seal it
were thwarted by village youths who attacked Shell technicians with
rocks, the spokesman said. It was not revealed where the leak
occurred or how it was caused, although Shell says it believes it
was the result of sabotage.
	   The shutdown cuts Shell's crude oil output in Nigeria _ the
world's sixth largest oil producer _ by about 145,000 barrels a
day.
	   Nigeria suffers hundreds of offshore and underground pipeline
spills every year.
	   Many are the result of sabotage by villagers who demand that the
government or companies pay monetary compensation for the resulting
environmental damage. Others are caused by scavengers who collect
the spilled oil to use and resell.
	   In October, an explosion and fire killed at least 700 people in
the southern town of Jesse, where poor residents were collecting
gasoline spilling from a government-owned pipeline.
	   Government officials said they believe scavengers' tools set off
the blast.
	   Some spills allegedly occur due to the neglect of international
oil companies and the Nigerian government, which owns many
pipelines.
	   Village youths disrupted Shell's production in the Niger delta
for several weeks in August during a campaign to protest lack of
essential services provided by the military government, which
receives oil revenue from multinational companies.
	   A U.N. human rights envoy on Monday reportedly called for an
independent inquiry into claims that international oil companies
have caused widespread environmental damage in Nigeria. There has
been no reaction by the government or oil companies to the call.

Iraqi businessman found dead in Jordan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The brother of Iraqi opposition leader Eyad
Allawi was found dead here of a gunshot wound to the head, and
Jordanian security officials said Tuesday he apparently committed
suicide because of financial problems.
	   Emad Allawi, 55, was found dead in the back yard of his Amman
apartment on Saturday, the officials said. They said an
investigation was under way but ruled out that the death was a
murder.
	   The London-based Al-Hayat newspaper on Tuesday quoted unnamed
``independent sources'' in Jordan as saying Allawi died in a way
suggesting he was killed by assailants working on behalf of the
Iraqi government.
	   The paper also quoted unnamed Western diplomats in Amman as
saying the Iraqi government is known to have plans to kill top
Iraqi opposition leaders, including Eyad Allawi.
	   Iraqi opposition members in Jordan said Allawi had serious
financial problems, but they did not give details.
	   They also said Allawi's body would be moved to neighboring Syria
this week for burial next to his wife, who died of cancer earlier
this year.
	   The security officials and Iraqi exiles spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Emad Allawi moved to Jordan in 1995 to establish a trading
company. He did not join opposition groups while in exile.
	   But there were reports that Iraqi authorities confiscated his
property and financial assets in Iraq to punish him for the
defection of his brother.
	   Eyad Allawi heads the Iraqi National Accord, a group of former
military leaders and diplomats who defected from Iraq and advocate
the overthrow of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.

UN inspectorate returns to full strength
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations has brought its
complement of 120 weapons inspectors in Iraq up to full strength, a
U.N. official said Tuesday.
	   The inspectors are ready to resume the intrusive searches of
suspected arms sites that the Iraqi authorities tried to halt on
Aug. 5 when they refused to provide the necessary escorts.
	   ``We are back at full strength as we were before the latest
crisis and we are ready to carry out all inspections,'' the
spokeswoman for the U.N. inspectors, Caroline Cross, said in
Baghdad.
	   The United Nations evacuated its weapons experts on Nov. 11 as
the United States and Britain prepared to launch air strikes to
force Iraq to reverse its Oct. 31 decision to cease all cooperation
with the inspectors.
	   Iraq relented Nov. 14, and inspectors began returning to Baghdad
three days later. The first batches of inspectors to return have
been checking monitoring equipment installed at sites where Iraq
previously worked on its program of missiles and weapons of mass
destruction.
	   But lately the United Nations has been flying in visiting teams
of inspectors whose mission is to search sites where Iraq is
suspected of hiding evidence of its banned weapons program. It is
these inspections that have previously brought Iraq and the United
Nations to the brink of a showdown.
	   ``We expect to see more visiting teams, and we will be real busy
for the next few weeks,'' Cross told The Associated Press.

Telstra boosts its Japanese presence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Telstra Corp. Ltd. is boosting its
presence in Japan, announcing Tuesday the purchase of a 10 percent
stake in a Japanese network-service company INTEC Communications
Inc.
	   Telstra is also increasing its service offerings from its wholly
owned local subsidiary, Telstra Japan KK, and boosting permanent
staff to about 50 from the current 17.
	   The INTEC business is forecast to post revenues of more than 50
billion yen (US dlrs 410 million) by its third year, said Telstra's
international managing director Ted Pretty.
	   He said the asset base stood at about 12 billion yen from day
one.
	   He declined to reveal a purchase price for the stake.
	   The new business represents certain infrastructure assets of
parent company INTEC Inc., one of Japan's largest information
technology companies, which have been hived-off into the new joint
venture vehicle.
	   INTEC retains a 70 percent stake in INTEC Communications.
Telstra joins Mitsubishi Corp., each with a 10 percent stake, along
with other minority players Nippon Life Insurance and Toshiba.
	   The move comes as Telstra revamps its international presence.
	   Market players have previously questioned Telstra's strategy,
which over this decade has been particularly focused on emerging
markets rather than developed economies which Telstra is fast
realizing it is better suited to serve.
	   Pretty, speaking with reporters by telephone from Japan, said
the company had now ``turned its attention to large markets,
targeting Japan, Europe and the U.S., upgrading our profile and
investment profile in these countries.''
	   Telstra's largest offshore commitment to date is in Vietnam,
where it has kicked in some 200 million Australian dollars (U.S.
dlrs 126 million) developing networks there.
	   Telstra's local subsidiary has also applied for a Type 1 carrier
licence in Japan, which allows it to offer a full suite of
telecommunication services in Japan.
	   Pretty said he hoped the new licence would be awarded early in
the new year.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1200 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed sharply lower
Tuesday on the back of Wall Street's 2.3 percent decline, with the
key index in Hong Kong tumbling for a third straight session. Hong
Kong's blue chip Hang Seng Index plummeted 4.1 percent, or 426.47
points, to close at 9,975.85, below the psychologically important
level of 10,000 points. The market has shed 7.1 percent since
Friday, when Hong Kong announced its gross domestic product fell by
7 percent in the third quarter. Since then two major companies _
Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company and Citibank _ announced
layoffs and the government hinted at a budget deficit for the
second year. Singapore shares also tumbled 3.4 percent, or 47.85
points, to close at 1,368.70. In Tokyo, the Nikkei average of 225
selected issues fell 48.29 points, or 0.3 percent, to 14,835.41.
The U.S. dollar bought only 122.78 yen in late Tuesday trading in
Tokyo, 1.04 yen lower than Monday's rate. (ASIAN MARKETS, HONG
KONG-ECONOMY)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ France's oil giant Total SA agreed to
take over the Belgian petrochemicals company Petrofina SA to create
the sixth-largest oil company in the world, the companies announced
Tuesday. The move was the latest in a series of mergers affecting
the global oil market. The new company, known as Total Fina, will
be quoted on the Paris, Brussels, New York and London stock
exchanges, a joint statement said. ``The combination of Total and
Petrofina will allow the new entity to capture substantial
productivity gains, particularly in the North Sea, and to expand
its positions in the deep offshore (United States, Angola),'' the
statement said. (BELGIUM-PETROFINA-TOTAL)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China still plans to break up the country's
telephone monopoly but foreign investors can't expect a slice of
the fast-growing sector any time soon, government officials said
Tuesday. Even with the eventual end of China Telecom's monopoly,
senior officials with the Ministry of Information Industry said
conditions were not ripe for foreign investors to operate in its
highly protected telecommunications services sector. China Telecom
towers over the huge market, serving most of the 110 million
telephone subscribers. That network is set to grow to 170 million
in two years. Mobile phone users alone are expected to jump to 40
million, from 23 million, according to ministry figures.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Even before Europe's single currency
is launched, politicians are challenging the independence of the
central bank that will keep tabs on the new euro. Germany's new
leaders have led the campaign, demanding that the European Central
Bank, after it takes over monetary policy Jan. 1, lower interest
rates to spur economic growth and create more jobs. The push
reflects growing demands across the European Union for a more
hands-on approach to monetary policy as the euro launch nears, and
some fear the tussle between politicians and bankers could damage
the historic project. The contest _ between the usual monetary goal
of promoting low inflation and the broader political goal of
spurring job creation _ challenges the new central bank's guiding
strategy: price stability modeled on the successful German
Bundesbank. (GERMANY-EURO PRESSURE)
	   PARIS (AP) _ Two of Europe's largest drug makers, Hoechst of
Germany and Rhone-Poulenc of France, announced Tuesday they are
merging their pharmaceutical and agrochemical operations. The new
company will be called Aventis, said a statement released by the
two companies. It is to be based in Strasbourg, eastern France. The
agreement launches the first phase of a plan ``which will
eventually lead to a full merger of Hoechst and Rhone Poulenc.''
Analysts have warned against a full merger until the heavily
indebted firms reduce costs. With annual sales of around dlrs 20
billion, the new company will be tied for the No. 1 ranking with
Switzerland's Novartis in the life-sciences sector. (RHONE

	   Here is a summary of news from The Associated Press. Stories
carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items below have
moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   LONDON (AP) _ The hospital where Gen. Augusto Pinochet has been
under police guard says he no longer needs medical care _ dealing a
blow to any plan by the former Chilean dictator to plead he is too
ill to stand trial on charges of genocide and torture. Grovelands
Priory, a private hospital in north London, issued a statement
Monday urging Pinochet's family to quickly find the 83-year-old
general somewhere else to stay, saying he ``no longer requires the
specialist medical and nursing care.'' The hospital's decision to
evict Pinochet makes it difficult for Britain's Home Secretary Jack
Straw to cite ``compassionate grounds'' based on ill and frail
health if he decides Dec. 11 to let Pinochet return home. A Spanish
magistrate ordered his arrest on charges of murder, torture and
genocide. (BRITAIN-PINOCHET)
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Like ambivalent boxing judges, Quebec voters
gave their combative politicians a split decision: the
pro-independence government gets another term in power, but with
support so tepid that a secession bid is unlikely any time soon.
The separatist Parti Quebecois retained a large legislative
majority in Monday's provincial election, winning 75 of the 125
seats to earn a new term of up to five years. But the
anti-separatist Quebec Liberal Party, though winning only 48 seats,
received 44 percent of the popular vote to 43 percent for the Parti
Quebecois. As a result, the comments of Liberal leader Jean Charest
sounded more buoyant than the victory speech of Premier Lucien
Bouchard, the separatist leader. ``The result tonight ... reflects
the fact that the people of Quebec, like the people of all Canada,
want this country of ours to work and be a success,'' said Charest.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The House Judiciary Committee is opening a
carefully scripted hearing into the consequences of perjury. But
behind the scenes, political fireworks are exploding over
Republican efforts to expand the impeachment inquiry from President
Bill Clinton's private life to his campaign fund raising. Committee
Republicans sought on Monday to subpoena secret Justice Department
and FBI memos urging Attorney General Janet Reno to appoint an
independent counsel to investigate the president's 1996 campaign.
The decision opens up a new avenue of investigation for the
impeachment panel, just as the committee is pressing for a vote by
Christmas on possible articles of impeachment against the
president. (US-CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In an apparent attempt to crush a budding
opposition party, Chinese police have detained two of China's most
prominent dissidents and three other democracy campaigners, a human
rights group and relatives of those taken into custody said
Tuesday. Police in two cities descended on the homes of Xu Wenli,
Qin Yongmin and other members of the China Democracy Party on
Monday night and took them away, relatives and the rights group
said. Dissidents formed the would-be opposition group in June to
challenge the ruling Communist Party's monopoly on power. Signaling
the leadership's resolve to quash any challenges, the party's No.
2, legislative chairman Li Peng, was quoted Tuesday as saying that
Western-style democracy was inappropriate for China and opposition
groups would not be tolerated. (CHINA-DISSIDENTS)
	   POTSDAM, Germany (AP) _ Leaders of Germany and France agreed
Tuesday to strengthen efforts to fight unemployment and boost the
economy, a well-placed source said, reflecting a stronger emphasis
on a left-leaning agenda for Europe. The source, who spoke to
reporters on condition of anonymity, was unclear about which common
initiatives might be planned. The leaders were issuing a joint
declaration later Tuesday after a two-day German-French summit
hosted by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, his first since he and his
Social Democrats won September elections in Germany. Both sides
also agreed that cooperation among industrial nations to combat
economically damaging turmoil in financial markets was a desirable
goal, the source said. (GERMANY-FRANCE)

Gas stations run dry as Greeks face customs strike fallout

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Gas stations began running dry Tuesday
with deliveries halted by a customs strike.
	   A court was expected to rule on a government request to declare
the strike illegal and order workers back to their posts.
	   Many filling stations had ``no gasoline'' signs hanging from the
pumps. At others, motorists formed long lines to fill up their
vehicles.
	   Greeks worry about shortages of gasoline and heating oil as
tankers and trucks were unable to unload their cargo because of the
five-day strike, which began Monday.
	   Union officials called the strike to protest government plans to
unify pension funds from various agencies.
	   The walkout is just one of many planned strikes around Greece
this week. There is growing labor union opposition to government
austerity plans aimed at qualifying Greece for the European Union's
single currency club by 2001.
	   Doctors at state-run hospitals also began strikes on Monday.
Railway workers are scheduled to participate in work stoppages
beginning Wednesday. Civil aviation workers also plan work
stoppages, which could disrupt flights.
	   A trolley strike that was to begin Tuesday was called off, but
bus drivers, tax officials and school teachers are still planning
walkouts.

Report:Crime and suicide rising in Russian military
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Crime and suicide continue to rise in the
demoralized Russian military with a growing number of officers
taking their own lives because of late pay and poverty, the
Interfax News Agency reported Tuesday.
	   Citing Defense Ministry statistics, the report said some 10,500
crimes and incidents had been recorded in the armed forces during
the first 11 months of 1998, compared to about 10,000 in all of
1997.
	   The Russian military has been falling apart in recent years
because the cash-strapped government can provide only a fraction of
the funding budgeted for the armed forces. Soldiers and officers
routinely go months without pay, often live in appalling
conditions, and bullying and crime are rampant.
	   Overall, the number of deaths in the military has declined, the
report said.
	   Some 500 servicemen were killed or died on active service
compared to 600 deaths last year. More than 800 servicemen were
killed or died in off-duty situations compared to about 1,000 such
deaths in 1997, the report, without adding any further details.
	   But suicides are climbing with about 350 cases reported this
year, said the report, without providing figures for last year.
More than 60 percent of suicides involved officers and poverty and
delays in salaries were cited as the main reason, it said.

More than 500 overseas Filipino workers died between January and
</HEADLINE>
September

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ More than 500 overseas Filipino
workers died between January and September this year and 936 others
are being held in jails, a government official said Tuesday.
	   An estimated 4.5 million Filipinos work abroad, chiefly as
housemaids, entertainers and construction workers.
	   Marilyn Alarilla, a Department of Foreign Affairs official, said
accidents, crimes and health problems caused most of the deaths.
Last year, 576 Filipino workers died abroad, including 156 women.
	   Alarilla said the government has worked to restrict employment
of Filipino housemaids in some Middle Eastern countries where many
cases of abuse have been reported in the past. Under the
restrictions, maids can work only for diplomats and government
officials in these nations.
	   Philippine officials also require maids and most other women
workers applying for work abroad to be at least 25 years old to
ensure that they are mature enough to handle difficult workplace
situations.
	   Of the jailed Filipino workers, 356 are in the Middle East and
Africa, 359 in Pacific Rim countries, 172 in Central and South
America, and 49 in Europe. More than 260 of those jailed in the
Middle East are in Saudi Arabia, she said.
	   Many Filipinos are forced to work in other countries because of
a shortage of job opportunities at home. They often endure daily
indignities ranging from verbal abuse to sexual advances from their
employers. But Filipinos at home generally see them as privileged
for being able to work overseas for higher wages.
	   Some officials estimate that more than 6 million Filipinos work
abroad since many do not register with government agencies.
	   The money the overseas workers send home is the country's
biggest source of foreign exchange in the Philippines.
	   In 1997, overseas workers sent home dlrs 5.7 billion through
official channels and much more through other means, helping soften
the effects on the Philippines of the Asian currency crisis.

Bush arrives on private visit to country that idolizes him

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Former U.S. President George Bush drew cheers from
American soldiers on Tuesday when he visited their camp north of
Kuwait City, U.S. Embassy officials said.
	   Journalists were not allowed to cover the event, but U.S.
diplomats quoted Bush as telling the 2,000 troops and civilian
employees at Camp Doha: ``I know why I get such enthusiastic
reception _ because you know you're going home.''
	   Most of the soldiers in the audience have been taking part in
Intrinsic Action, a desert exercise that started in August and is
scheduled to end later this month.
	   Several hundred of the soldiers are stationed on a long-term
basis at the camp to maintain military equipment prepositioned in
Kuwait to defend against any Iraqi aggression.
	   Bush is idolized in Kuwait as hero of the 1991 Gulf War, which
ended Iraq's seven-month occupation of the country.
	   Speaking from a stage covered with camouflage netting, Bush told
the American soldiers he wanted to ``drop by and say thank you'' to
members of the military that showed in 1991 they were the ``finest
fighting force in the world,'' the U.S. diplomats said. They
insisted that their names not be used.
	   Bush was on his third visit to Kuwait. Although it is a private
one, he met with the emir, Sheik Jabar al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and was
to attend a dinner with Kuwaiti dignitaries and businessmen. He
leaves early Wednesday.
	   When Bush first came to Kuwait in April 1993, authorities
uncovered a plot to assassinate him. Two Iraqis were sentenced to
death in connection with the plot, and several others were given
prison terms.
	   Bush earlier visited Egypt and Saudi Arabia.

Report: former ambassador to become prime minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Smail Hamdani, a senator and former
ambassador to Paris, is expected to become Algeria's prime minister
within the week, Algerian newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   Reports of the eventual resignation of Prime Minister Ahmed
Ouyahia, in office since January 1996, have circulated since
President Liamine Zeroual announced in September that he would cut
short his term.
	   Early presidential elections are set for April. Ouyahia's name
is among those circulating as potential presidential candidates.
	   According to the paper Demain l'Algerie, Hamdani, described as a
non-partisan technocrat, will take office on Dec. 6.
	   There was no official confirmation of the report.
	   But the head of the leftist Workers' Party, Louisa Hanoune, told
reporters Monday that other Cabinet changes were in the offing.
	   After speaking with Zeroual, she said he'd told her that Ouyahia
and several other government ministers would be stepping down
``around Dec. 10.''
	   In addition to Ouyahia, Communications Minister Hamraoui Habib
Chawki, interim Justice Minister Hamed Nouj and Interior Minister
Mustapha Ben Mansour will be resigning, according to Hanoune.
	   Zeroual did not reveal who would replace the ministers, Hanoune
said, saying only that the successors would be ``non-partisan.''
	   Ouyahia has not denied rumors over his reported plans to run for
the presidency.
	   In the past, it has been the army that determines the nation's
president, drawn from military ranks. Zeroual is a retired general.

Chile presses Spain to stop Pinochet's extradition

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Chile's foreign minister said Tuesday that
a Spanish judge's attempt to extradite Gen. Augusto Pinochet has
polarized his homeland but poses no threat to Chilean democracy.
	   Jose Miguel Insulza began a round of talks Tuesday with Spanish
officials, attempting to persuade them to drop the extradition
request so Pinochet can go home.
	   Acting on a Spanish judge's request, police arrested Pinochet on
Oct. 16 at a London clinic where he was recuperating from an
operation. He faces charges of murder, torture and genocide in
Spain.
	   Insulza came here Monday after a four-day visit to Britain,
where he tried to persuade the Labor Party government not to
extradite the 83-year-old former dictator.
	   Insulza met early Tuesday with Luis Lopez, Supreme Court vice
president, and Juan Ignacio Barrero, president of the Senate. He
was scheduled to meet later in the day with Prime Minister Jose
Maria Aznar and Foreign Minister Abel Matutes.
	   ``Democratic stability in Chile is not at risk,'' Insulza said
after his meeting with Barrero, but urged a quick solution because
``it's affecting my country very much.''
	   Shortly after arriving Monday in Madrid, Insulza said that the
political climate in Spain would make a fair trial for Pinochet
impossible.
	   Insulza said Pinochet could be tried in Chile if he is allowed
to go home. Pinochet has immunity from prosecution in Chile and
critics say even if this were lifted, he would appear before a
military court packed with his supporters.
	   British Home Secretary Jack Straw has 10 more days to decide
whether to let Spain go ahead with extradition proceedings.
	   A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared at the hands of the police after Pinochet seized power
in a military coup that toppled democratically elected President
Salvador Allende.

Officials: Russia may repeal moratorium on death penalty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government may rescind its pledge to
ban capital punishment because of the country's soaring lawlessness
and crime, officials said Tuesday.
	   ``The moratorium (on death penalty) is likely to be canceled,
and punishment will be made more severe,'' said Vladimir
Kartashkin, head of the Commission for Human Rights under President
Boris Yeltsin, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Russia promised to scrap the death penalty in January 1996 when
it joined the Council of Europe, a human rights organization.
Nonetheless, 92 people were executed before Yeltsin imposed a
moratorium on executions later that year.
	   The government says there have been no executions since August
1996, but Yeltsin's previous efforts to outlaw capital punishment
have been blocked by hard-liners in the Russian parliament, who
argue that the death penalty is needed to control crime.
	   With only a moratorium on executions, Russian courts have
continued handing down death sentences and about 1,000 people are
now on death row, according to the Amnesty International human
rights group.
	   Polls show a majority of Russians support capital punishment.
	   The unsolved slaying last month of liberal lawmaker Galina
Starovoitova, perhaps the most prominent woman politician in
Russia, caused a public uproar and renewed calls for tougher
government action against crime.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov responded last week by promising
to ``physically eliminate'' organized crime. He didn't elaborate,
but other officials said that would probably mean a revival of the
death penalty.
	   Council of Europe officials said they were bewildered by
Primakov's statement and expressed hope that Russia would honor its
commitments, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Kartashkin said that senior prosecutors, judges and police
officials are strongly pushing for resuming executions. He spoke
against that, saying that such an action would undermine Russia's
prestige abroad.
	   ``We joined the Council of Europe, signed corresponding legal
acts and can't violate the constitution and our international
obligations even in the current difficult situation,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin's first deputy chief of staff Oleg Sysuyev also strongly
opposed resuming executions, saying it was unlikely to help combat
crime. ``The death penalty ban remains on today's agenda,'' he
said. ``Its suspension will only deceive the society without
bringing the desired results.''
	   Earlier this year, parliament's lower house, the State Duma,
ratified the European human rights convention with the exception of
a death penalty ban.

German tourists injured in bus accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ At least 14 German tourists were injured
when their bus overturned Tuesday on a highway near the Red Sea,
police said.
	   The bus, which was carrying 33 German visitors, was en route
from the Red Sea resort of Hurghada to the Egyptian capital Cairo
when the accident occurred, they said. Hurghada is 415 kilometers
(250 miles) southeast of Cairo.
	   Police said that the bus apparently overturned after it swerved
to avoid an oncoming car. They said 14 people were hurt.
	   Officials at the Al-Salam International Hospital in Cairo, where
the injured were evacuated, said 12 Germans were treated for minor
injuries and released. Three other Germans, they said, remained at
the hospital for further care. All were in good condition, they
added.
	   The discrepancy in numbers could not immediately be resolved.

Israeli opposition leader hires Clinton aide for campaign
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The political consultant who engineered Bill
Clinton's come-from-behind victory in the 1992 presidential race
hopes to do the same for the Israeli opposition leader.
	   Campaign adviser James Carville will arrive in Israel next month
to talk strategy with Ehud Barak, a former armed forces chief of
staff and leader of the opposition Labor Party.
	   Barak has failed to pull ahead in the polls despite the repeated
scandals that have tarnished Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Carville will work with pollster Stanley Greenberg and media
specialist Robert Shrum.
	   The three have contributed to the successful campaigns of
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder, said Barak spokeswoman Aliza Goren.
	   ``We have hired this team because we are very serious about
winning the elections,'' Goren said.
	   She said Israeli Labor Party officials also have met with their
counterparts in Germany and Britain to look at campaign strategies
there.
	   The next elections are scheduled for 2000, but Netanyahu's
coalition is shaky and there is a growing possibility that a vote
might be held as early as spring or summer.
	   Hard-liners have been threatening to leave Netanyahu's
government over the land-for-security agreement with the
Palestinians. Such a defection would rob Netanyahu of his majority
in parliament.
	   Without such a majority, Netanyahu would either have to call
early elections or try to bring other parties into his coalition.
	   Netanyahu has relied on his own U.S. consultant, Arthur
Finkelstein, who helped him narrowly defeat incumbent Prime
Minister Shimon Peres in the 1996 elections.
	   Finkelstein has worked for some of America's top conservative
politicians, including Sen. Jesse Helms, a Republican from North
Carolina, and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, a New York Republican.
	   Netanyahu has flown Finkelstein to Israel several times to
advise him in times of political crises.
	   In a heated debate July in parliament, Barak accused Netanyahu
of being politically out of touch and having to rely on American
spin doctors for direction.
	   ``Rather than calling Finkelstein, we should think for ourselves
and take the path of peace and security,'' Barak said at the time.
	   Netanyahu replied that Barak also relied on U.S. advisers and
mentioned Greenberg.

Swiss conclude vital transport deal with European Union
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Four years of tough negotiations were
concluded early Tuesday with a transport deal between the European
Union and Switzerland, clearing the way to a wider agreement
covering areas like air transport and labor.
	   The deal obliges the Swiss _ who long held out for environmental
reasons _ to raise the weight limit on trucks to 40 tons from 28
tons by the year 2005.
	   In return, they will levy a tax of at least 325 Swiss francs
(dlrs 230) on trucks transiting through the Alpine nation. This
will be used to help fund two rail tunnels, intended to take the
pressure off the roads.
	   Switzerland is not a member of the 15-nation EU, but is
surrounded by members Germany, France, Italy and Austria. Its tight
restrictions on foreign trucks have for years infuriated
neighboring countries because of the inconvenience of compliance
and the cost of detours.
	   After an all-night bargaining session with Swiss Transport
Minister Moritz Leuenberger, EU ministers gave their blessing to
the transport agreement early Tuesday. Under the compromise deal,
Switzerland is allowed to keep its controversial night-time ban.
	   The Swiss government and business representatives hailed the
agreement.
	   Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti said he hoped that a wider
package of bilateral agreements could now be wrapped up. In
particular, Switzerland hopes that its concessions on trucks will
persuade the EU to give national flag carrier Swissair better
access to European airports.
	   The dossier is due to be discussed at a meeting of EU Foreign
Ministers next Monday. However, with the EU preoccupied with its
own plans for monetary union and eastward expansion, the Swiss
dossier is low on the list of priorities.
	   In 1992, Swiss voters rejected plans to join a loose European
free trade agreement . This forced the government into painstaking
sectoral negotiations with Brussels to gain the access it needs to
crucial export markets.
	   The government has officially applied to join the EU but has not
pressed ahead with its request, fearing that the electorate might
once again say ``no.''

Chicago physicist plans to open cloning lab, fertility clinic in
</HEADLINE>
Japan
 &UR; AP Photos TOK105-106
 &UR; By MARI YAMAGUCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ An American physicist who provoked controversy at
home by announcing plans to clone humans has found a haven for his
research: Japan, where there is no law that bans what he wants to
do.
	   Richard Seed, who has three Harvard degrees but no medical
license, announced Tuesday that he is preparing to open up an
animal cloning lab and fertility clinic in Japan, both of which are
eventually aimed at making human clones.
	   ``It seems all countries or political groups have some
reservations on human cloning. But there is an existing patient
demand for the service,'' Seed said.
	   In the United States, a five-year moratorium announced by
President Bill Clinton to ban cloning has apparently been observed
by most mainstream scientists, although Congress has failed to act
on legislation to outlaw the procedure.
	   In Japan, there hasn't been nearly as much national debate about
the ethics and safety of cloning as in the United States and
elsewhere.
	   Japan's Science and Technology Agency appointed a 16-member
panel last January to ponder the ethics of cloning. Last year, the
Education Ministry followed the United States' lead by freezing
government funds for research on human cloning.
	   But with a domestic cattle industry squeezed by imports of
cheaper beef, Japanese scientists and agricultural officials see
cloning as the answer to keeping the nation's small farms
competitive by genetically copying animals on a large-scale basis.
	   Some officials remain nervous about taking the next step up the
food chain, however.
	   ``In Japan, there is no law that prohibits human cloning,'' said
Tomoko Kitajima, a Health and Welfare Ministry official in charge
of maternal and child health.
	   ``But applying cloning technology in humans is a problem not
only because of its safety concerns but also ethically and
socially.''
	   Seed said he wants to change the minds of naysayers.
	   ``There is always a risk in the first time you do anything,'' he
said.
	   Already some dlrs 15 million, or about 75 percent of the
estimated cost for Seed's project, has been raised, said James
Ryan, a Tokyo-based consultant for the physicist.
	   The group has obtained land on Japan's northernmost island of
Hokkaido and expects to open its animal cloning lab there as early
as next August.
	   Seed's project will also provide treatment for infertile couples
in Japan, where most U.S.-style treatments are not yet available.
	   No Japanese law prohibits the practice, but ethical standards
set by the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology restricts
in-vitro insemination to married couples. An egg removed for
fertilization cannot be implanted in another woman in Japan.
	   ``Our goal is to help people,'' group consultant Ryan said.
``Demand for infertility will overcome all obstacles.''
	   Seed, who had earlier said he was planning to clone himself,
said he has changed his mind: ``I switched to a clone of my wife
because people say if I clone myself it would be ego trip.''
	   The cloning of his wife, Gloria, is still in research stage and
will take another two years or so before completion, he said.
	   ``The clone is an identical twin of a donor, just 40 years
younger,'' Seed said. ``If you don't tell, nobody will know.
Everybody has seen children that look just like parents.''

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Several alleged associates of a Mexican
banker accused of fraud have been detained for investigation of
money laundering in the Dominican Republic, prosecutors announced.
	   The weekend detentions _ which netted three Italians, two Puerto
Ricans and two Dominicans _ appear to strengthen conjecture that
former banking magnate Carlos Cabal Peniche may have engaged in
money laundering, in addition to charges of bank fraud currently
pending against him.
	   The detentions were related to ``illegal acts committed by
Carlos Cabal Peniche in the Dominican Republic,'' where he fled
after charges were lodged against him in 1994 in Mexico, the
Attorney General's Office said in a press statement Monday.
	   The alleged associates were detained by the Dominican National
Office of Drug Control for questioning about their possible
involvement in forgery and money laundering.
	   Dominican authorities have also seized properties on the
Caribbean island which allegedly belong to Cabal, who spent nearly
four years on the run before his capture in Australia on Nov. 10.
	   Prosecutors charged Cabal with violating banking laws after he
apparently misappropriated as much as dlrs 700 million from a bank
he owned.
	   Cabal rose from obscurity to the top levels of Mexico's business
world, mingling with political leaders in the early 1990s and
winning control of two formerly state-owned banks, Banco Union and
Banca Cremi.
	   Authorities say Cabal made loans to himself from his banks, a
practice that is subject to strict limits under Mexican law, and
never paid the money back.
	   Mexico has said it will seek his extradition from Australia, and
announced Monday that Australian police have also detained Cabal's
brother-in-law, Marco Pasini, for violating that country's
immigration laws.
	   Pasini faces charges in Mexico relating to Cabal's alleged bank
frauds, and also faces an extradition hearing.

Bush arrives on private visit to country that idolizes him
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Former President Bush arrived Tuesday in Kuwait to
meet with Kuwaiti dignitaries and U.S. troops maintaining weapons
positioned here to defend against any Iraqi attack.
	   It was his third visit to a country that idolizes him as the
hero of the 1991 Gulf War, which ended a seven-month Iraqi
occupation of Kuwait.
	   Although Bush's visit is a private one, he was greeted at the
airport by the crown prince, Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah.
	   The former president planned to meet with U.S. Army troops
stationed at Camp Doha, north of Kuwait City.
	   Bush, accompanied by a group of investors, is to meet the emir,
Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and attend a dinner with Kuwaiti
dignitaries and businessmen. He was scheduled to leave early
Wednesday.
	   Security is tight, and the press has been told it will have no
access to Bush during the visit.
	   When he first came to Kuwait in April 1993, authorities
uncovered a plot to assassinate him. Two Iraqis were sentenced to
death in connection with the plot, and several others were given
prison terms.
	   Bush earlier visited Egypt and Saudi Arabia.

Roadside bombs kill Israeli-backed militiaman, injure another
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Roadside explosions killed an
Israeli-backed Lebanese militiaman and wounded another in south
Lebanon on Tuesday, security officials said.
	   The Shiite Muslim movement Hezbollah claimed responsibility for
the two blasts near a road junction outside the town of Jezzine, 20
kilometers (12 miles) north of Israel's panhandle.
	   A fighter of the South Lebanon Army militia was wounded in the
first blast at 2:30 a.m. (0030gmt) and a colleague was killed in
another explosion nine hours later, said Lebanese security
officials, who spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The attacks came amid mounting tension in Lebanon following
Israeli threats to bomb the capital Beirut to avenge the deaths of
Israeli soldiers. Seven Israelis have been killed by guerrillas in
south Lebanon since mid-November.
	   Hezbollah's claim said the early morning blast ripped through a
jeep traveling in a convoy of vehicles from the South Lebanon Army,
which is armed and financed by Israel.
	   The victim in the second explosion was a militia security
official, Jean Mukheiber, who was killed as he walked away from a
militia checkpoint, the Lebanese officials said.
	   Hezbollah, of the Party of God, is leading a guerrilla battle to
oust Israeli soldiers and their allied militiamen from an enclave
that Israel has occupied in south Lebanon since 1985.
	   Israel claims the occupation is needed to protect its northern
towns from attack, but the frequent deaths of Israeli soldiers in
south Lebanon has raised debate in Israel about maintaining the
occupation.

Key witness at Anwar tried to win favors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with statement from European Union, more
comments from witness.
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A key police witness in the Anwar
Ibrahim trial told the court Tuesday that he had failed to win
business favors from the ex-deputy prime minister, but denied that
led him to testify against the defendant.
	   The former police intelligence officer, Amir Junos, faced
questioning from defense attorneys about whether he was biased
against Anwar because his request for favors had been denied.
	   Earlier, the witness had admitted during cross-examination that
he had asked Anwar for equity in a securities firm and business
deals for his friends.
	   ``I was not given anything. I merely tried to express my feeling
to get a portion of the equity but I did not get anything,'' Amir
told the court.
	   Defense lawyer Christopher Fernando suggested Amir might bear a
grudge after having failed to get the equity stake in the
brokerage.
	   ``I do not have such intentions,'' Amir replied.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, two weeks after he was fired as
deputy prime minister and finance minister.
	   His subsequent jailing and beating while in custody has
attracted international concern over the case, including
governments from the 15-member European Union.
	   ``The EU is concerned that the Malaysian authorities have still
not published the results of the investigations (on the beating)
and urges them to do so as soon as possible,'' the European Union
said in a statement made available Tuesday.
	   Anwar is being tried on four counts of corruption. He will be
tried on another corruption count, as well as five counts of sexual
misconduct, at a later date.
	   Anwar, who was also finance minister, denies the charges,
calling them part of political vendetta orchestrated by his former
mentor, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Amir was called as a witness by the prosecution to prove
allegations that Anwar had directed the police to obtain
retractions from two people who accused Anwar of having sex with
his secretary's wife and sodomizing his chauffeur.
	   On Tuesday, Amir conceded under cross-examination that it was
wrong for police to have used scare tactics to obtain retractions
from Ummi Hafilda Ali and Azizan Abu Bakar.
	   ``What Anwar asked you to do, was it wrong or improper?'' asked
defense attorney Gurbachan Singh.
	   ``I think it is wrong,'' Amir said.
	   ``Are you then admitting that what you did was wrong and
improper?'' Gurbachan pressed on.
	   After a long pause, Amir quietly said: ``It was wrong. What I
did was wrong.''
	   Amir also acknowledged that Anwar didn't order police to obtain
retractions from Ummi and Azizan using the ``turning over''
operation, a method of interrogation that includes sleep
deprivation and physical threats.
	   However, he maintained that Anwar abused his power as deputy
prime minister, coercing police officers to carry out his desires
without issuing specific orders.
	   The trial, now in its fourth week, has been buffeted by chaos,
including the sentencing on Monday of a defense lawyer to a
three-month jail sentence for contempt of court.
	   Judge Augustine Paul handed down the sentence Monday after
Zainur Zakaria refused to apologize for an affidavit he had filed
on behalf of Anwar seeking the removal of two prosecutors on
grounds that they were fabricating evidence.
	   The lawyer, who won a reprieve from a higher court until his
appeal hearing Friday, was present in the court Tuesday.
	   Amir, the chief witness on Tuesday, also denied warning Anwar
about ``political enemies'' or telling the former No. 2 that his
phone had been tapped since 1992.
	   Defense lawyer Fernando asked Amir if he had warned Anwar that
trade minister Rafidah Aziz and former chief minister of Malacca
state, Abdul Rahim Thamby Chik, were his enemies because he had
recommended that they face corruption charges.
	   ``I disagree that I had identified by name several of Anwar's
enemies,'' Amir said.

Iranian naval maneuvers to test electronic warfare system
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran will test an electronic warfare system
capable of jamming enemy radar in maneuvers scheduled for later
this week, a military official said Tuesday.
	   He said that until now, the Iranian navy only had the capability
to defend against electronic warfare. But new systems developed
internally will give Iranian warships the capability of jamming
enemy electronics, the official said. He spoke on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   The five-day maneuvers, code-named Unity 77, will be launched
later this week, perhaps as early as Thursday, with some 50,000
troops participating.
	   The navy commander, Rear Adm. Ali Akbar Ahmadian, said Monday
that Oman will send observers to the war games.
	   He said the maneuvers will take place in an area extending from
the central Gulf to the Strait of Hormuz and into the Gulf of Oman.
	   Iran has tried for a decade to conduct joint military exercises
with Gulf states, which are allies of the United States. But so
far, no Gulf country has agreed to take part because of Tehran's
insistence that U.S. warships should leave the region.
	   The war games will involve missile-launching units of the
Revolutionary Guards and mock ``electronic warfare will be carried
out over a wide area,'' the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
	   Among the maneuvers' goals will be to assess Iran's defense
against chemical, biological and nuclear attacks, IRNA said.
	   Iran concluded military exercises involving some 200,000 troops
on its border with Afghanistan last month after Afghanistan's
Taliban militia killed eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist in
the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif.

Sharp drops on European exchanges after Wall Street, Asian dips
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Asian Markets-Stocks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Share prices dropped sharply on European stock
exchanges Tuesday, following big falls on Wall Street and in Asian
markets.
	   The London Stock Exchange, Europe's largest, set the pace with a
fall of 2.6 percent on the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index.
	   Blue-chip indexes were down 3.2 percent in Germany, 3.4 percent
in Paris, 3.2 percent in Oslo, 2.7 percent in Zurich and Stockholm,
2.6 percent in Amsterdam, and 2.3 percent in Milan and Madrid.
	   ``There was just nothing supportive out there,'' said Peter
Caulkett of Teather-and-Greenwood in London. ``But there is a
feeling that stocks had come up too far too soon and investors are
now running scared.''
	   On Wall Street Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.3
percent in the first big wave of profit-taking since the market
recovered strongly two months ago.
	   Asian markets followed the trend, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng
Index down 4.1 percent Tuesday, and Singapore's Straits Times Index
off 3.4 percent. Tokyo was an exception, with a mild 0.3 percent
decline in the Nikkei 225-stock average.
	   Local concerns contributed to the drops on some European
exchanges.
	   Analysts in Frankfurt said the 3.2 drop on the Xetra DAX index
partly reflected disappointment with Deustche Bank's announcement
that it expected no immediate savings from its takeover of Bankers
Trust, a U.S. investment bank. Deutsche Bank's shares fell 2.7
percent in the morning.
	   In Paris the CAC-40 index was down 3.4 percent, led by 9.9
percent plunge in shares of Total. Investors deserted the petroleum
company after is announced it was getting back into the refinery
sector by acquiring Petrofina of Belgium.
	   The Swiss Market Index was 2.7 lower, in part because of
profit-taking in the financial sector and a switch toward buying
pharmaceutical stocks.

UN agency launches campaign to protect field workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A U.N. food agency said Tuesday that violence
against aid workers is growing at an alarming rate and that it
planned to train its staff on how to handle potentially dangerous
situations.
	   The Rome-based World Food Program said 45 of its staffers had
been murdered or died from work-related accidents or illnesses in
the past decade. Nine field workers were murdered in 1998 alone,
with the latest slaying Nov. 14, when a staffer on duty at a
warehouse in Kuito, Angola, was shot to death.
	   While previously only the staffers heading to the most dangerous
areas underwent training, WFP has now hired experts to teach all of
its 4,000 staff members emergency procedures including the use of
satellite phones to relay distress calls and escape and evacuation
methods.
	   ``All our people need to know how to react to emergency
situations,'' said WFP spokesman Jeffrey Rowland. ``Some of the
areas we did not consider dangerous have been transformed into high
risk areas.''
	   Rowland said that the agency had started setting aside funds to
cover security needs for each operation. He said the funds would be
used for everything from de-mining to boosting the number of
military personnel escorting convoys, depending on the risks of
each project.
	   The agency has appealed to governments of host countries to help
ensure the safety of its staff.
	   ``Host countries must agree that safety and security is a
nonnegotiable issue and that WFP will suspend operations in a
country if its personnel is placed in extreme danger,'' said Arnold
Vercken, head of the WFP's security task force.
	   WFP also said it aimed to increase cooperation with other UN
agencies to develop a worldwide U.N. security policy.

Official says Philippines won't hit 1998 investment target
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government won't hit
its target of generating 500 billion pesos (dlrs 12.6 billion) in
investments this year as Asia's financial crisis continues to cause
businessmen to think twice about spending on new projects, a
government official said Tuesday.
	   ``It would be difficult to hit our investment target for the
year based on the latest figures we gathered,'' Board of
Investments Managing Director Melito Salazar said.
	   The government's investment target has already been scaled down
twice this year, from an original 700 billion pesos (dlrs 17.7
billion) in January to a revised 550 billion pesos (dlrs 13.9
billion) in July.
	   In the nine months through September, 164.4 billion pesos (dlrs
4.2 billion) in investments were registered with the government, 67
percent lower than the 498 billion pesos (dlrs 12.6 billion) in the
year-earlier period.
	   The government considers fresh capital infusion and expansion
activities as new investments.
	   Businessmen have said that the weakening economy is causing
uncertainty among investors, despite the country's generally better
growth prospects than other Asian countries embroiled in the
financial crisis.
	   The Philippine economy expanded slightly in the third quarter of
1998, with the gross national product growing 0.8 percent from the
year-earlier period. However, gross domestic product shrank 0.1
percent.
	   In the third quarter last year, GNP growth was 5.2 percent while
GDP growth was 4.9 percent.
	   GNP measures a country's total output, while GDP excludes income
from abroad.

Sudanese rebels repulse government attack

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Sudanese rebels said Tuesday they fought
off a four-pronged government attack in the Nuba Mountains in
western central Sudan.
	   Government ground forces attacked the region on Nov. 11 and were
finally driven out on Nov. 23, said Martin Okerruk, spokesman for
the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army in Nairobi.
	   Sudanese opposition radio said SPLA troops killed 42 government
soldiers, wounded many others and took four prisoners. Two rebel
soldiers were killed and eight wounded, it said.
	   Okerruk said he could not confirm the casualty figures because
he was still waiting for details from the field.
	   Animist and Christian rebels in southern Sudan have fought a
15-year insurgency for autonomy from the Arab, Muslim-dominated
government in the north. More than 1.5 million Sudanese have died
in the fighting and consequent famines.

Nigeria suspends patrols by anti-crime task force
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ A special military commando force
established to fight violent crime in Nigeria's commercial capital
of Lagos has been pulled off the city streets following the
shooting deaths of three men last month.
	   Commandos shot and killed three men in Lagos, claiming they were
armed robbers. The killings, however, have triggered an outcry
against the heavily armed task force.
	   Lagos military administrator Col. Buba Marwa was quoted Tuesday
on state radio as saying the move to withdraw the anti-crime force
was in response to public opinion.
	   Lagos and much of Nigeria is notorious for violent crime,
including kidnappings, armed robbery and murder.
	   The military's anti-crime commando force won accolades initially
for reducing the crime rate, particularly the number of armed
robberies. But a recent string of shooting deaths blamed on the
commando force has soured public opinion.
	   Nigeria's military, which has ruled this West African country
for much of the time since independence in 1960, is often viewed
with suspicion.
	   The current military ruler, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, has been
working to put a kinder face on the army's public image and has
promised to return power to civilians next year.

Strong earthquake jolts China's southwest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A strong earthquake jolted China's hilly
southwest Tuesday, causing several farmers' houses to collapse, the
Central Seismology Bureau reported.
	   There were no reports of casualties from the preliminary
magnitude of 5.1 quake which struck Xuanwei county in Yunnan
province shortly after 3:30 p.m. (0730 GMT), state media and a
bureau seismologist reported.
	   The quake toppled several houses in rural villages and cracked
walls in one or two buildings in Xuanwei's county seat, on the
eastern edge of Yunnan, said the seismologist, who declined to be
named.
	   Less than two weeks ago, a pair of strong quakes killed five
people, injured 4,000 and left 25,000 homeless more than 300
kilometers (180 miles) west of Xuanwei along Yunnan's northern
border with Sichuan province.
	   The seismologist said Tuesday's quake was not related to the
more catastrophic temblors which struck a few days ago.

Parents of woman convicted of drug smuggling appeal for early
</HEADLINE>
release

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The parents of a British woman convicted of heroin
trafficking in Thailand have appealed to the British government for
help in persuading the King of Thailand to reduce her 22-year
prison sentence.
	   Sandra Gregory, 33, was convicted in 1996 and sentenced to 25
years in a Thai prison after being stopped at the Bangkok airport
with more than 100 grams (3.5 ounces) of heroin. Her sentence was
later reduced to 22 years under a general amnesty from the King of
Thailand and she was transferred to a British prison last year
under a British-Thai prisoner exchange treaty.
	   In a letter published in Tuesday's edition of the Scotsman
newspaper, Stan and Doreen Gregory say they believe the government
should write to the King of Thailand requesting a reduction in the
sentence.
	   The couple say their daughter was ill when she tried to smuggle
heroin from Bangkok to Tokyo in 1993.
	   While they accept her crime was serious, they contrast her case
with those of other Britons convicted of drugs offenses in Thailand
and the case of British nurses Lucille McLauchlan and Deborah
Parry, who were released after being convicted in Saudi Arabia of
killing Australian nurse Yvonne Gilford.
	   The couple also cite the case of two women who were released
from a Bangkok jail in 1993 after the intervention of then Prime
Minister John Major. They had been convicted of having 4 million
pounds (dlrs 6.6 million) worth of heroin.

Roadside bombs kill Israeli-backed militiaman, injure another
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Roadside explosions killed an
Israeli-backed Lebanese militiaman and wounded another on Tuesday
in south Lebanon, security officials said.
	   The Shiite Muslim movement Hezbollah claimed responsibility for
the two blasts near a road junction outside the town of Jezzine, 20
kilometers (12 miles) north of Israel's panhandle.
	   A fighter of the South Lebanon Army militia was wounded in an
early morning blast and a colleague was killed in another explosion
nine hours later, said Lebanese security officials, who spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   The attacks came amid mounting tension in Lebanon following
Israeli threats to bomb the capital Beirut to avenge the deaths of
Israeli soldiers. Seven Israelis have been killed by guerrillas in
south Lebanon since mid-November.
	   Hezbollah's claim said the early morning blast ripped through a
jeep traveling in a convoy of vehicles from the South Lebanon Army,
which is armed and financed by Israel.
	   The victim in the second explosion was a militia security
official, Jean Mukheiber, who was killed as he walked away from a
militia checkpoint, the Lebanese officials said.
	   Hezbollah, of the Party of God, is leading a guerrilla battle to
oust Israeli soldiers and their allied militiamen from an enclave
that Israel has occupied in south Lebanon since 1985.
	   Israel claims the occupation is needed to protect its northern
towns from attack, but the frequent deaths of Israeli soldiers in
south Lebanon has raised debate in Israel about maintaining the
occupation.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with minister acknowledging units turned to
crime, order to establish them came from top ANC commanders, other
quotes, detail; no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ A Cabinet minister in President
Nelson Mandela's government on Tuesday told a human rights panel
how he organized vigilante groups to protect supporters of the
African National Congress.
	   But Jeff Radebe, minister of public works, told the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission that he had little control over the
groups' actions once they were armed.
	   More than 5,000 people died in clashes between the so-called
self-defense units and Zulu nationalists of the Inkatha Freedom
Party Zulu in the several years before 1994 elections ended
apartheid. Radebe contends no one died as a result of his actions.
	   ``This place was in flames. Almost every Saturday I used to bury
comrades,'' Radebe said.
	   Radebe is seeking amnesty for his role in organizing the units,
which mainly operated in KwaZulu-Natal from 1990-1994. He is the
first ANC Cabinet minister to testify at a public amnesty hearing.
	   The orders to set up the units came from the head of the
Communist Party, the now-deceased Chris Hani, and Ronnie Kasrils _
currently deputy defense minister. The two men were top members of
the ANC's armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation).
	   Umkhonto members helped train the units and often fought with
them, Radebe said. But there was no chain of command leading back
to Umkhonto or the ANC central organization, he said.
	   However, he acknowledged in an interview with The Associated
Press ``that some of the comrades gravitated toward crime.''
	   As the elections approached in 1994, Radebe said he was ordered
to disarm the units and integrate them into military and police
structures.
	   But security analysts say this has not happened, and that many
members of the units are contributing to the country's soaring
crime rate.
	   Radebe's amnesty hearing was held in Durban, the main city of
KwaZulu-Natal, which is located on the Indian Ocean.
	   Top-ranking ANC government officials, including Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki and Justice Minister Dullah Omar, applied for
individual amnesties in last-minute submissions before the deadline
last year.
	   They were among 37 ANC officials who had been granted blanket
amnesty by the committee.
	   The blanket amnesty was withdrawn after a court challenge by the
opposition National Party claiming the decision violated the
requirement that applicants name specific crimes.
	   The officials had claimed only broad political responsibility
for actions taken during the anti-apartheid struggle.
	   It is not clear when or if their amnesty applications will be
heard.
	   Radebe applied for amnesty separately from the 37 officials. He
said he and his party regret the excesses committed by the
self-defense units.
	   ``I think as we are building a new democracy in South AFrica,
our people ... need to know the truth, and to open the old wounds
of the terrible time from 1990 to 1994.''
	   The Truth Commission in October released a report assigning
major blame for human rights violations to the National Party,
apartheid's architect. But it also cited the ANC for excesses.
	   The commission has the power to grant amnesty to those who
confess to specific crimes and can demonstrate a political motive _
a process expected to last well into next year as decisions are
made on over 7,000 amnesty applications.

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan should let the market determine its
exchange rate, a former Sudanese finance minister said in remarks
published Tuesday.
	   Sudan, one of Africa's poorest states, has three exchange rates.
The official or the customs rate which currently stands at 2,300
Sudanese pounds to the dollar. The commercial bank rate that
fluctuates between 2,302 and 2,315 pounds to the dollar. And the
black market where a dollar sells for 2,340 pounds.
	   ``The unification of the official and black market exchange
rates, and the application of a foreign exchange market system as a
mechanism for revealing the real rate,'' would help the government,
Abdel-Rahman Hamdi said in remarks published in the newspaper
Al-Usbu.
	   ____
	   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ The Saudi businessman Hani Yamani
has provided dlrs 2 million to create a new airline in
collaboration with Eritrean Airlines, his office said Tuesday.
	   Red Sea Airlines will be 60 percent owned by Yamani's
Jiddah-based company, Air Harbour Technologies, and 40 percent
owned by Eritrean Airlines.
	   In addition, Yamani's office said Air Harbour Technologies plans
to invest more than dlrs 150 million during the next five years to
develop tourism on Eritrea's Red Sea coast.
	   The company plans to build six hotels and four airports on the
coast and in the Dahlak archipelago, a group of 300 islands in the
Red Sea.
	   ____
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Credit Suisse Bank is to close its office
in Bahrain at the end of December, an official of the bank said
Tuesday.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, declined to
give the reasons for the closure, but said Credit Suisse would move
its Bahrain operations to its regional office in Dubai in the
United Arab Emirates.
	   The Zurich-based Credit Suisse has had an office in Bahrain
since 1975.
	   Bahrain is the Middle East's leading banking center. About 47
offshore banking units operate from the tiny Gulf island.
	   ____
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The price index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange fell
by 10.04 percent in November, closing the month at 1,777.1 points,
a market report by the National Investments Co. said Tuesday.
	   The decline was caused by low oil prices and the crisis between
Iraq and the United Nations over weapons inspectors, the report
said.
	   A local controversy over a government proposal to pump money
into the exchange also contributed to the fall, the report said.
The central bank governor, Sheik Salem Abdul-Aziz al-Sabah, was
reported to have resigned to protest a decision by a ministerial
committee to allow investment companies to extend special loans to
investors.
	   The dispute ended when the Cabinet allowed the central bank to
decide if the exchange needed the extra funding.
	   The report said some 506.86 million shares changed hands in the
21 days of trading during November, down 24.9 percent from those
traded during the same number of days in October. The value of
these shares also dropped by 34.41 percent to 99.43 million dinars
(dlrs 329.2 million). The figures were the lowest this year.
	   The exchange lists 77 companies, but trading is restricted to
Kuwaitis and nationals of the other five Arab states in the Gulf:
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman.
	   ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The number of ships docking at Jordan's Red
Sea port of Aqaba fell by 14 percent to 2,172 ships between January
and October this year, an official said Tuesday.
	   The decline was caused by the shrinking number of passengers
taking the ferry from the Egyptian port of Nuweiba', said the
director-general of the Aqaba Port Authority, Mohammed Dalabeeh.
	   Dalabeeh declined to elaborate, but he appeared to be referring
to the Jordanian government's decision to impose stringent measures
on Egyptians seeking work in Jordan.
	   Iraq, Jordan's largest trade partner, has used Aqaba for much of
its imports since its own ports were heavily damaged during the
1991 Gulf war.
	   Dalabeeh said the total volume of goods handled at Aqaba between
January and October this year was 10.4 million tones, 2 percent
more than during the same period in 1997.

Euro-zone nations break deadlock over international representation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ With just a month to go before the
launch of the euro, European Union finance ministers reached an
11th-hour agreement Tuesday on who should speak for the
single-currency bloc on the world stage.
	   The agreement resolved months of deadlock between big and small
nations over who should represent the 11-nation currency bloc at
the G-7 group of world economic powers and other international
meetings.
	   Under the compromise, three existing G-7 nations _ Germany,
France and Italy _ keep their seats and will take turns to
represent the bloc. Details of the deal were sketchy but it
appeared that smaller nations would also get a chance to set at G-7
meetings, when they holds the six-month euro-zone presidency.
	   That means German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine will speak
for the euro-zone for the first six months of 1999, to be joined by
his Finnish counterpart Sauli Niniisto for second half of the year.
	   The European Central Bank, which will oversee monetary policy in
the euro-zone, will replace national central banks at G-7 meetings.
The EU's executive Commission will offer only ``technical
assistance'' to the European delegation.
	   The launch of the euro as the shared currency of 11 EU nations
will create a single bloc that could rival the United States and
Japan as a global economic power.
	   But while U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Japanese
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa can always get on the phone to
discuss the world's economic situation, nobody was sure whom to
call when they wanted to speak to the euro-bloc.
	   The rotating system of euro-zone presidencies should go some way
to meeting that need. The deal is set to be confirmed by EU leaders
at their year-end summit next week in Vienna, Austria.
	   The issue had provoked a rift between the EU's existing G-7
members who refused to relinquish their seats, and smaller
euro-zone nations who demanded some sort of representation. There
was no immediate reaction to the deal from other G-7 nations _ the
United States, Japan and Canada. Britain, the EU's fourth G-7
members is staying out of the euro.
	   Later Tuesday, the ministers were set to review plans to close
tax loopholes that cost national treasuries billions of dollars in
lost revenue. Officials played down talk of a rift between Britain
and Germany over tax plans.
	   British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown criticized
recent ``scare stories'' in the London press about alleged German
plans to impose EU-wide taxes. However, he repeated British
opposition to any such plans.
	   ``Some people want to argue that there is an inevitability about
a single currency leading to a single tax rate,'' Brown told the
British Braodcasting Corp. ``That is not the way that I see it.''

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan should let the market determine its
exchange rate, a former Sudanese finance minister said in remarks
published Tuesday.
	   Sudan, one of Africa's poorest states, has three exchange rates.
The official or the customs rate which currently stands at 2,300
Sudanese pounds to the dollar. The commercial bank rate that
fluctuates between 2,302 and 2,315 pounds to the dollar. And the
black market where a dollar sells for 2,340 pounds.
	   ``The unification of the official and black market exchange
rates, and the application of a foreign exchange market system as a
mechanism for revealing the real rate,'' would help the government,
Abdel-Rahman Hamdi said in remarks published in the newspaper
Al-Usbu.

	   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ The Saudi businessman Hani Yamani
and Eritrean Airlines have put up dlrs 2 million to create a new
airline, Yamani's office said Tuesday.
	   Red Sea Airlines will be 60 percent owned by Yamani's
Jiddah-based company, Air Harbour Technologies, and 40 percent
owned by Eritrean Airlines.
	   In addition, Yamani's office said Air Harbour Technologies plans
to invest more than dlrs 150 million during the next five years to
develop tourism on Eritrea's Red Sea coast.
	   The company plans to build six hotels and four airports on the
coast and in the Dahlak archipelago, a group of 300 islands in the
Red Sea.
	   ____
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Credit Suisse Bank is to close its office
in Bahrain at the end of December, an official of the bank said
Tuesday.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, declined to
give the reasons for the closure, but said Credit Suisse would move
its Bahrain operations to its regional office in Dubai in the
United Arab Emirates.
	   The Zurich-based Credit Suisse has had an office in Bahrain
since 1975.
	   Bahrain is the Middle East's leading banking center. About 47
offshore banking units operate from the tiny Gulf island.
	   ____
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The price index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange fell
by 10.04 percent in November, closing the month at 1,777.1 points,
a market report by the National Investments Co. said Tuesday.
	   The decline was caused by low oil prices and the crisis between
Iraq and the United Nations over weapons inspectors, the report
said.
	   A local controversy over a government proposal to pump money
into the exchange also contributed to the fall, the report said.
The central bank governor, Sheik Salem Abdul-Aziz al-Sabah, was
reported to have resigned to protest a decision by a ministerial
committee to allow investment companies to extend special loans to
investors.
	   The dispute ended when the Cabinet allowed the central bank to
decide if the exchange needed the extra funding.
	   The report said some 506.86 million shares changed hands in the
21 days of trading during November, down 24.9 percent from those
traded during the same number of days in October. The value of
these shares also dropped by 34.41 percent to 99.43 million dinars
(dlrs 329.2 million). The figures were the lowest this year.
	   The exchange lists 77 companies, but trading is restricted to
Kuwaitis and nationals of the other five Arab states in the Gulf:
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman.
	   ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The number of ships docking at Jordan's Red
Sea port of Aqaba fell by 14 percent to 2,172 ships between January
and October this year, an official said Tuesday.
	   The decline was caused by the shrinking number of passengers
taking the ferry from the Egyptian port of Nuweiba', said the
director-general of the Aqaba Port Authority, Mohammed Dalabeeh.
	   Dalabeeh declined to elaborate, but he appeared to be referring
to the Jordanian government's decision to impose stringent measures
on Egyptians seeking work in Jordan.
	   Iraq, Jordan's largest trade partner, has used Aqaba for much of
its imports since its own ports were heavily damaged during the
1991 Gulf war.
	   Dalabeeh said the total volume of goods handled at Aqaba between
January and October this year was 10.4 million tones, 2 percent
more than during the same period in 1997.

English newspapers hammer England on Ashes loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Newspapers lashed out Tuesday after yet another
humiliation for England's cricket team.
	   ``Day England lost all credibility,'' said a blaring headline in
The Express.
	   ``That's the worst I have seen in 83 test matches,'' said The
Mirror, quoting England captain Alec Stewart.
	   ``One of our worst ever performances,'' echoed The Sun.
	   England's seven-wicket hammering by Australia Monday in the
second Test of the Ashes series _ England was bowled out for 112 in
39 overs on the opening day _ again reminded the nation how far it
has slipped in a game it invented.
	   To make matters worse, on the same day England was battered,
upstart Zimbabwe _ the lowest ranked of the nine Test-playing sides
_ picked up its first overseas Test win when it beat Pakistan by
seven wickets.
	   Writing under a headline calling England ``second-raters on
cricket's world stage,'' The Express columnist James Lawton said
the loss reflected deeper problems.
	   ``It is not just the specter of another defeat which makes
someone who cares for England's cricket legacy feel here like a man
walking down Park Lane with holes in his shoes,'' he said.
	   ``The grimness of this conclusion is that it may be that our
cricket future is drifting beyond our own hands,'' he added.
	   He was referring to a suggestion from former Australia captain
Ian Chappel that England may no longer rate five-Test status
against Australia.
	   ``I just don't know how we can keep handing out the five Tests
to England when teams like Pakistan and South Africa are beginning
to mean a lot more to the young people here,'' he quoted Chappel as
saying.
	   England has won just four of the last 30 Ashes matches to
Australia's 18, and the defeat inside three days means Australia
needs to win only one of the next three Tests to retain the Ashes.
	   The Daily Mail said even the Australian reserves were good
enough to beat England.
	   ``Australia's second 11 could probably beat the tourists as
well,'' wrote columnist Bob Willis.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ France's oil giant Total SA has agreed
to take over Belgium's Petrofina SA to create the sixth-largest oil
company in the world, seeking to cut costs in an increasingly
competitive sector deflated by low crude prices.
	   The move was the latest in a series of mergers affecting the
global oil market. The new company, known as Total Fina, will seek
quotation at the Paris, Brussels, New York and London stock
exchanges, a joint statement said.
	   ``The move is part of global change, oil prices have practically
been cut in half over the past year. All companies are seeking to
survive in this new situation,'' said Total Chairman Thierry
Desmarest. ``The business environment will be tougher than in the
past years.''
	   The agreement is based on a stock swap that provides nine Total
shares for two Petrofina shares. When the operation will be over,
Total will control about 41 percent of Petrofina, Belgium's largest
industrial company. It will bid for the rest of the Petrofina
shares later.
	   The market capitalization of both companies combined stood at
1,391 billion Belgian francs (dlrs 39.9 billion). The new group
would employ 69,100 people. The companies said the employment
totals would largely remain the same under the new company.
	   The Paris stock exchange was not immediately convinced and Total
shares took a big hit, falling almost 10 percent in early trading
Tuesday.
	   ``When you add a sliding dollar and sluggish crude oil prices to
the fact that investors have no details yet to gauge the benefits
of the Petrofina takeover, you get a tumbling stock,'' said a Paris
trader.
	   Petrofina's stock stood at 14,250 francs (dlrs 407.9) Friday
before it was suspended for Monday's trading. The deal put the
value at 19.482 francs (dlrs 557.7), a jump in value of more than a
third.
	   ``We have to recognize that the value today is higher than what
we could get as a stand-alone company in the medium term,'' said
Francois Cornelis, head of Petrofina.
	   The merger comes amid many changes in the oil industry. In
August, British Petroleum announced a dlrs 49 billion takeover of
Amoco Corp. And The Washington Post reported Tuesday that an
agreement had been reached for Exxon Corp. to buy Mobil. The oil
companies, the two largest in the United States, say only that
talks are ongoing.
	   Petrofina stock has been gaining ground in recent days on rumors
that the company was in talks with France's Elf Aquitaine SA, Total
SA and Italy's ENI SpA.
	   ``The combination of Total and Petrofina will allow the new
entity to capture substantial productivity gains, particularly in
the North Sea, and to expand its positions in the deep offshore
(United States, Angola),'' a joint statement said.
	   ``In refining-marketing, Total Fina will hold solid positions''
in the European Union. ``Joint management of the refineries and the
marketing networks should yield substantial productivity gains,''
the statement said.
	   A combined general meeting of shareholders has been called for
Jan. 14 to approve the agreement. Total said a public offering on
the remaining Petrofina shares will follow.
	   Petrofina, which employs 14,700 people worldwide, is one of
Belgium's biggest industrial companies. It is best known for its
refining and distribution operations in Europe and the United
States.
	   Total SA employs 54,400 and is the smaller of France's two oil
companies and has aggressively expanded its upstream business,
mainly through exploration and especially in gas.

	   --
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Weeds have choked a major hydroelectric
dam, reducing electricity supplies to Uganda and Kenya, a newspaper
said Tuesday.
	   The severe shortfall in power generation since Nov. 23 ``is as a
result of the decaying water hyacinth that has invaded the dam,''
Uganda Electricity Board Director Alex Muyayo was quoted as saying
in the government-owned New Vision newspaper.
	   The Owens Fall Dam, about 70 kilometers (about 44 miles) east of
Kampala, produces 180 megawatts of electricity, of which about 30
megawatts is exported to Kenya.
	   Mugoya said while in the past the green weed floated, minimally
reducing generation, this time rotting weed sank to the bottom of
the river and became entangled in turbines, significantly reducing
power supplies.
	   The utility has had to switch off the clogged machines to clear
away debris.
	   ``Even the performance of the remaining machines is also
lowered. At times this leaves UEB with only 100 megawatts of the
180 megawatt installed,'' Mugoya said.
	   Huge mats of the gauzy purple blossoms and thickly tangled roots
of water hyacinths are mushrooming along the shores of Lake
Victoria and in linked waterways, disrupting life for millions of
people.
	   Water hyacinths were introduced into Africa as ornamental plants
a century ago, and have grown out of control.
	   --
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Kenya got its fourth English-language
daily Tuesday with the launch of The People, owned by veteran
opposition politician and businessman Kenneth Matiba.
	   Sporting its motto ``Fair, Frank and Fearless,'' the former
weekly People joins The Daily Nation, The East African Standard and
Kenya Times.
	   The Nation Group also publishes a Swahili-language daily, Taifa
Leo.
	   Matiba's 30-year-old daughter, Ivy, is the paper's managing
editor, and her 33-year-old brother, Raymond, who also handles his
father's Alliance Hotel group, is the director.
	   --
	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ Representatives of Ghana's mining ministry
and the oil giant Shell have held preliminary talks to explore a
joint venture in alternative electricity production, a news report
said Tuesday.
	   Participants at the meeting held Monday in Ghana's capital of
Accra discussed the development of renewable energy sources from
timber waste, the Ghana news agency reported.
	   A program expected to start early next year with technical help
from the Dutch Biomass Technology group will involve the generation
of electricity from sawdust and other timber waste.
	   The project aims to supply electricity to rural communities.
	   Ghana was chosen for the project because it is politically
stable, has enough forest area and needs more energy sources for
development, said Frans Feil, a senior consultant with Shell's
biomass group.
	   Biomass systems make use of plant and other organic material to
produce energy.
	   --
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Trade Minister Alec Erwin said
Tuesday he was optimistic a free trade agreement among 14 southern
African countries could be completed next year.
	   The agreement envisions an eight-year tariff reduction program.
Members of the Southern African Development Community are
negotiating the terms of the reductions.
	   Speaking at a trade and investment meeting, Erwin stressed that
the community's integration was inevitable if the region wanted to
develop.

IMF agrees with Thai forecast of 1 percent GDP growth next year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai government and the
International Monetary Fund have agreed on a forecast of 1 percent
economic growth for Thailand next year, after this year's 7 percent
contraction in gross domestic product, a Cabinet minister said
Tuesday.
	   The projection came as the Cabinet approved a letter of intent
outlining economic and policy targets, legislative reforms, public
works and social development programs to which it will commit
itself in the upcoming sixth quarter of a dlrs 17.2 billion IMF
rescue package.
	   The return to growth will come slowly as a contraction of 3.3
percent has been forecast for the first quarter of 1999, followed
by mild 0.2 percent growth in the second quarter.
	   Pitak Intrawityanunt, a minister of the Prime Minister's Office,
said the letter of intent will allow for a public sector deficit
equivalent to 5 percent of gross domestic product to stimulate
stagnant domestic demand.
	   It also calls for speedy progress in recapitalizing the banking
sector, and passage of a rack of economic reform legislation
currently stuck in Parliament.
	   Pitak said the government budget deficit currently accounts for
3 percent of GDP, and the state enterprise investment budget totals
2 percent.
	   The IMF had earlier insisted on more stringent restraints on
public spending, which critics said were hindering economic
recovery.
	   The Thai government has made five out of a scheduled 12
withdrawals from the IMF package, totaling dlrs 11.95 billion.
	   Once the IMF board in Washington approves the draft letter of
intent, Thailand will be eligible to draw another dlrs 480 million
in the sixth quarter of the IMF program.
	   Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai told reporters at a press
conference after the Cabinet meeting the country will see renewed
economic growth by the second half of 1999.
	   The new letter of intent will respond with a sharper focus on
rural development and steps towards decentralization of budgetary
powers, an Asian Development Bank official told Dow Jones
Newswires.
	   ADB and World Bank programs funded through the IMF credit line,
possibly to be supplemented by additional funds from Japan, are to
pump hundreds of millions of dollars over the next few years into
rural infrastructure, worker training and agricultural research and
assistance programs.
	   Thailand plans to spend 1 percent of its GDP on social safety
net and related labor-intensive investment projects, according to
the letter of intent, signed by Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda and addressed to IMF Managing Director Michel
Camdessus.
	   ``As far as possible, these (projects) will be foreign
financed,'' the letter said.
	   The recapitalization and restructuring of a financial sector
buried in more than 2 trillion baht (dlrs 55 billion) worth of
non-performing loans remains a centerpiece of the IMF program.
	   ``By the end of January next year, the central bank will
complete the next round of negotiations with all banks and finance
companies to ensure that they remain fully capitalized during the
six month period through June,'' the letter said.
	   Bank of Thailand Governor Chatu Mongol Sonakul told the press
conference he expects to be able to reach agreement with all
financial institutions by the deadline.
	   Analysts are concerned that financially-weak, medium-sized
commercial banks are being given too much time to raise funds,
delaying the renewed credit extension that is needed along with
domestic consumption to revive production.

Helicopter rescues TV crew trapped on Arctic island

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian helicopter swooped down through a
blizzard in the dim light of the brief Arctic day Tuesday to rescue
a TV crew that had been stranded for weeks on a remote island by
bad weather.
	   The helicopter evacuated the three-man crew, which included a
Russian, a Japanese and an Australian who had been making a
documentary on polar bears. The crew was airlifted from Wrangel
Island to the port of Pevek, the Ministry of Emergency Situations
said.
	   ``It wasn't easy to find pilots,'' said Dean Finlay of the
international emergency company AEA International SOS. ``Also,
there was only a three hour daytime window in the area, and just
over two hours of flight time, so they had to get the window just
right.''
	   The rescue helicopter had lifted off from Pevek at 11:30 a.m.
local time (1130 Monday GMT) _ the height of the Arctic day that
never gets brighter than twilight.
	   The temperature on Wrangle Island has been around minus 30
Celsius (minus 22 Fahrenheit), with unusually bad weather.
	   ``We were filming polar bears and other animals,'' the Russian
member of the team, Nikita Ovsyannikov, told Russian television
channel NTV. ``On Oct. 15 we completed the work, and a flight was
ordered to take us back.''
	   ``But this year the weather conditions were very unusual: heavy,
long cyclones, the weather was constantly bad, with powerful
blizzards. So the flight couldn't arrive.''
	   The Japanese crew member, Tatsuhiko Kobayashi, developed
complications from a recent eye operation, but the others were in
good health, Russia's ORT television reported.
	   There were conflicting reports on who organized the rescue.
Emergency Situations Ministry spokesman Viktor Beltsov said the
rescue was organized by his agency using an Mi-8 helicopter hired
from a private airline.
	   But AEA International SOS said it had organized the rescue,
according to Mark Crawford, the company's spokesman in Australia.
	   ``They're in fair spirits,'' Crawford said of the crew.
``They're surviving, of course, but they were down to their last
three days of food.''
	   Crawford said his company had been hired to conduct the rescue
by the filmmakers' employer, Natural History Pty. Ltd., in New
Zealand.
	   The film crew arrived on Wrangel Island on Sept. 2 and intended
to leave Oct. 15, but were delayed by bad weather. The weather also
prevented the Emergency Situations Ministry from sending a rescue
helicopter.
	   The three were holed up in a cabin on the island's northeast
coast, about 550 kilometers (350 miles) west of Alaska.
	   Their food supplies were running out, raising concerns about the
men. Residents of a village about 130 kilometers (80 miles) from
the hut attempted to take emergency supplies to the crew, but were
defeated by bad weather.
	   Emergency officials earlier offered to try to rescue the crew by
snow tractor, but the three reportedly turned down the offer
because they would have been forced to leave most of their
equipment behind, ORT television reported.
	   Kobayashi is an employee of NHK, the Japanese television
company. The Australian is cameraman John McGuiness.

Gary Hall Jr. escapes suspension, expected to compete Tuesday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: WILL be led with results of 1415 GMT hearing &QL; 
 &UR; By AMANDA RIDDLE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHOENIX (AP) _ A judge ruled that Olympic gold medalist Gary
Hall is eligible to swim in an international competition despite a
marijuana-related suspension that is scheduled to run through Dec.
12.
	   U.S. federal court Judge Roger Strand issued a temporary
restraining order Monday allowing Hall to compete, but set a
hearing for 7:15 a.m. (1415 GMT) Tuesday to give FINA, swimming's
world governing body, a chance to respond.
	   FINA secretary Gunnar Werner said he would argue that Hall's
appeal should be dismissed and the remainder of his suspension
upheld. Werner said the court should have no jurisdiction in the
case.
	   In addition, the Swiss-based Court of Arbitration of Sport (CAS)
issued a ruling Monday rejecting Hall's request for a temporary
restraining order.
	   ``Our position is that FINA rules are prevailing in a case like
this,'' Werner said Tuesday in a telephone interview from Sweden.
``Our position is the court in the U.S. is not competent. The last
instance of appeal is the CAS. Also, FINA has its seat in
Switzerland and is covered by Swiss law.''
	   What if the U.S. court rules in Hall's favor?
	   ``I think we would have to accept that,'' Werner said. ``The
only thing we could do is appeal, and that would take too long. We
would have to live with such a decision.''
	   Werner said the case underscores the continuing battle between
international sports federations and national courts, especially in
the United States, over who controls sport.
	   ``Our position is that FINA rules should prevail all around the
world,'' he said. ``But what can we do if a national court makes a
ruling? We can only fight for our position.''
	   Hall, who lives in Phoenix, won gold medals as part of the U.S.
400-meter freestyle and 400 medley relay teams in the 1996 Atlanta
Games. He also won silver medals in the 50 and 100 freestyle.
	   He was scheduled to compete in Tuesday's World Cup competition,
and later this week in the U.S. Open Competition, both in College
Station, Texas.
	   His attorneys argued that both competitions are essential to
Hall's preparation and qualification for the 2000 Olympics, and to
his efforts to secure endorsement contracts.
	   A ruling denying Hall permission to compete would be
``devastating not only to his career but financially,'' attorney Ed
Hendricks told Strand during a one-hour hearing.
	   Hall was temporarily suspended in July after FINA said he tested
positive for marijuana during a May 15 competition in Phoenix. That
prevented Hall from swimming in the Goodwill Games and the U.S.
Senior Nationals.
	   The federation delayed the suspension in August to allow a
hearing after Hall appealed the sanction.
	   During a Nov. 6 hearing, Hall received a three-month suspension
from FINA's doping panel for testing positive for marijuana. That
suspension was effective Nov. 12.
	   FINA then deducted two of the three months already served by
Hall during the temporary suspension, which left him with 30 more
days to serve.

Three Bhutanese soldiers killed, Bodo guerrillas suspected
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WASBIR HUSSAIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAUHATI, India (AP) _ Suspected tribal separatists attacked a
Bhutanese general's convoy as it passed through India Tuesday,
shooting and killing three of his escorts, Indian police said.
	   The general, traveling through Indian territory from one part of
Bhutan to another, was unhurt. Six other soldiers were injured,
four of them critically, in the attack in the Kokila Forest, 170
kilometers (about 100 miles) west of Gauhati, capital of Assam
state. Police said the attackers were believed to be militants from
the Bodo tribe who are active in the region.
	   It was not clear why the general, identified by Indian police
only as Brig. Datto, was traveling in the volatile region.
Bhutanese officials were not immediately available for comment.
	   Both the Bodo Liberation Tiger Force and the National Democratic
Front of Bodoland want to carve out a separate Bodoland from Indian
territory for the Bodos, who are nearly 1.2 million of Assam's 22
million people. The militants are entrenched in camps in southern
Bhutan, from where they stage hit-and-run attacks on Indian
security forces.
	   But it is rare for Bodo militants to strike Bhutanese forces and
risk antagonizing a government that has so far been careful to stay
out of the Indian dispute. The attackers may have thought the
relatively large escort accompanying the general was part of an
offensive.
	   India says hundreds of guerrillas from its northeastern state of
Assam have set up camps in southern Bhutan. The Indian army is
forbidden to give chase across the frontier because that would
violate Bhutanese sovereignty. Bhutan says it does not want to give
the guerrillas sanctuary, but its own army of just 6,000 fighters
is unable to secure the area.
	   Bhutan is believed to fear that if it allows India to attack the
guerrilla bases, the rebels will retaliate by cutting off its vital
road links to India.
	   Bhutan relies on India for 85 percent of its imports and for
tens of millions of dollars in development aid annually. The
guerrilla bases are a rare point of discord between India and
Bhutan, the closest allies among the countries of South Asia.

Most of archeological digs in Israel halted over budget dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Archeology, one of Israel's biggest tourist
attractions, suffered a blow Tuesday when most of the country's
excavations were shut down.
	   The Israel Antiquities Authority halted its salvage digs after
the Supreme Court ruled that developers and building contractors
cannot be billed for the costs of these excavations.
	   In the country of Jesus and King Solomon, Richard the Lion Heart
and Saladin, it is almost impossible to start a building or a road
without uncovering ancient remains.
	   In the archeological sense Israel is the one of the most crowded
countries in the world, with some 25,000 known sites excavated or
still waiting to be dug up.
	   Ahead of most construction projects, the Antiquities Authority
carries out a salvage dig. In response to a petition from a
developer, the Supreme Court ruled Sunday that the government, not
the builder, must bear the costs of the salvage digs.
	   In response, the Antiquities Authority decided Tuesday to halt
all salvage digs which account for about 300 of the 350 excavations
carried out in Israel each year.
	   ``We have no budget for salvage digs,'' said Antiquities
Authority spokeswoman Osnat Gouez.
	   Major digs open to the public like those in Jerusalem, Caesarea
and Beit Shean have been drastically curtailed for lack of
government funding, Gouez said.

High-tech reveals pharaonic capital in Nile Delta
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Using magnetic sensors and computers,
Egyptian experts have located and mapped an important pharaonic
city in the Nile Delta, officials said Tuesday.
	   Ahmed Gouda Husain of the Geophysical Research Center said the
experts have been able to create detailed images of Qantir, which
was a capital of one of Egypt's most famous kings, Ramses II.
	   Ramses II, a pharaoh in the so-called New Kingdom era, ruled
Egypt from 1304 to 1237 B.C.
	   ``It's a complete town with all its palaces, houses, streets and
stables,'' Husain told The Associated Press.
	   Husain said the team he heads has been using magnetic sensors to
survey the city, which also served as the capital of the Hyksos
invaders for nearly a hundred years.
	   He said that surveying the city _ covering a square kilometer
(about half a square mile) of cotton, corn and wheat fields _ took
about 45 days.
	   The team used a piece of equipment known as a ``graduometre,''
which was provided by a German foundation, to measure electric
impulses and magnetic levels at the site, Husain said.
	   Husain, a geophysicist who has been working in archaeology for
15 years, said the team later put the readings into a computer to
generate images of the city.
	   Qantir, some 114 kilometers (76 miles) north of Cairo, is
covered with sandy mounds that archeologists believe cover a number
of pharaonic sites.
	   Gaballah Ali Gaballah, head of Egypt's Supreme Council for
Antiquities, said the site was discovered in the 1920s. He said it
would require at least 20 years of excavations to unearth the main
sections of the city.
	   Husain said his team has used high-tech equipment to make a
number of important archaeological discoveries in Egypt.
	   In Sohag in the south, for example, they found tombs and 12
buried solar boats, designed to carry the dead in their after
lives.

Iranian naval maneuvers to test electronic warfare system
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran will test an electronic warfare system
capable of jamming enemy radar in large-scale maneuvers scheduled
for later this week, a military official said Tuesday.
	   He said that until now, the Iranian navy only had the capability
to defend against electronic warfare. But new systems developed
internally will give Iranian warships the capability of jamming
enemy electronics, the official said. He spoke on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   The five-day maneuvers, code-named Unity 77, will be launched
later this week, perhaps as early as Thursday, with 50,000 troops
participating.
	   The navy commander, Rear Adm. Ali Akbar Ahmadian, said Monday
that Oman will send observers to the war games.
	   He said the maneuvers will take place in an area extending from
the central Gulf to the Strait of Hormuz and into the Gulf of Oman.
	   Iran has tried for a decade to conduct joint military exercises
with Gulf states, which are allies of the United States. But so
far, no Gulf country has agreed to take part because of Tehran's
insistence that U.S. warships should leave the region.
	   The war games will involve missile-launching units of the
Revolutionary Guards and mock ``electronic warfare will be carried
out over a wide area,'' the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
	   Among the maneuvers' goals will be to assess Iran's defense
against chemical, biological and nuclear attacks, IRNA said.
	   Iran concluded military exercises involving some 200,000 troops
on its border with Afghanistan last month after Afghanistan's
Taliban militia killed eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist in
the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif.

Report: economic freedom in Asia significantly decreased in turmoil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES 6th graf with comments from Singapore official; ADDS
remarks from Hong Kong official and economists in 15th-20th grafs.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Although Hong Kong and Singapore retain their
top places in an annual index ranking levels of economic freedom,
Asian governments grappling with a protracted financial crisis are
imposing tighter economic controls, a U.S. think tank said Tuesday.
	   Hong Kong, which has held the title of the freest economy in the
world for the past three years, won this year only on a
technicality, said the conservative Heritage Foundation.
	   The list was compiled in June, before the Hong Kong government's
foray into the financial markets in August in an attempt to drive
out speculators, the foundation said. Since the market
intervention, Hong Kong has lost the title for the freest economy
to Singapore.
	   ``It is my sad duty to report that Hong Kong, as of today, no
longer has the freest economy in the world,'' the foundation's
president, Edwin Feulner, said at a press conference.
	   Singapore's deputy prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, welcomed the
news.
	   ``We are naturally happy that Heritage Foundation has recognized
Singapore in its evaluation. We hope this will encourage more
investors to look seriously at what Singapore has to offer, even
during the economic crisis,'' he said.
	   Hong Kong is not unique in backing away from economic freedom as
financial troubles sweep across the world, the group said. The
survey showed for the first time since the project started in 1995,
more countries curtailed economic freedom during the past year than
expanded it.
	   ``Far too many countries have reacted in exactly the wrong
manner to the global economic downturn,'' said Kim R. Holmes, the
foundation's vice president.
	   These countries should have been eliminating existing
restrictions on trade and investment, freeing their banking and
currency systems from bureaucratic and political manipulation,
Holmes said.
	   Malaysia introduced tight currency controls to isolate its
battered economy from the regional fallout.
	   The study rates the freedom of 161 countries' economies by
trade, tax, monetary and banking policies.
	   It also considers government intervention in the economy,
capital flows and foreign investment as well as wage and price
controls.
	   Following Singapore and Hong Kong in the rankings was Bahrain.
New Zealand came fourth and Switzerland was fifth. The United
States was ranked sixth.
	   Ireland, Luxembourg, Taiwan and Britain were all tied for 10th
place.
	   Japan dropped one notch from 11th to 12th. The group said the
Japanese government's response to the recession has been lackluster
so far.
	   ``If Japan think it can emerge from the economic doldrums with
paltry tax cuts and a dose of government spending, it is
mistaken,'' Feulner said.
	   Hong Kong government officials and private economists disputed
the city's loss of its ranking as the world's freest economy.
	   Some said Singapore still lags Hong Kong in many measures of
economic freedom, such as government regulation and intervention in
corporate affairs, as well as in transparency and freedom of the
press.
	   ``We are not a command economy. We are a free economy - by any
fair measure, the freest in the world,'' said financial secretary
Donald Tsang.
	   Terence Koo, associate director of economics and strategy at
Indocam Hong Kong Ltd., said ``it's naive to believe Singapore is
an extremely free market.''
	   Koo cited recent Singapore government efforts to reduce wages as
evidence of a lack of economic freedom in the city-state.
	   ``The Hong Kong government definitely does not intervene in
day-to-day company operations,'' he said.

European Union opens information office in Hungary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The European Union opened an
information center in downtown Budapest Tuesday to keep Hungarian
citizens abreast of EU issues and policies, particularly
enlargement.
	   ``Fast and correct information is indispensable, especially if
you deal with such important issues as EU enlargement,'' said
Michael Lake, EU ambassador to Hungary.
	   The new center is located in the same building as Budapest City
Hall.
	   ``I'm proud that from now on the flag of the European Union will
be flying high on the City Hall,'' said Budapest Mayor Gabor
Demszky.
	   Similar information centers operate in the capitals of EU
countries, and one was opened in Prague six weeks ago, Lake said.
	   Hungary was among the first European countries, along with the
Czech Republic and Poland, to be invited to join NATO. Hungary,
along with the Czech Republic, are also among the first nations
under consideration for the first round of EU enlargement.
	   The center offers services to people interested in EU-related
topics, such as regulations, policies, and legislation from
agriculture to security and foreign policy through EU databases via
the Internet, CD-ROMs, video tapes, as well as read books and
brochures.

Taipei mayor's race a dead heat as candidates hold final debate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo TPE102 shows campaign scene &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The opposition mayor of Taiwan's capital
city is locked in the political fight of his life, and the strain
was visible Tuesday as two rivals ganged up on him in the last
campaign debate.
	   Mayor Chen Shui-bian, of the Democratic Progressive Party, is
running in a statistical dead heat with challenger Ma Ying-jeou of
the ruling Nationalist Party, as voters prepare to go to the polls
Saturday.
	   Chen's DPP party is expected to make minor gains at most in
legislative races the same day, so activists are counting on Chen
to hang onto the office in Taipei. They hope that will give them a
better chance in a presidential contest 16 months away, when
President Lee Teng-hui plans to retire.
	   But Chen found himself on the defensive Tuesday, as Ma and
longshot Wang Chien-hsuan of the tiny New Party accused the mayor
of stirring up antagonism between the native Taiwanese majority and
the mainland Chinese immigrants who dominated the island's politics
until the advent of democracy in the late 1980s.
	   Ma and Wang warned that Chen supporters could resort to violence
if voters throw the mayor out of office.
	   Chen, whose slumped shoulders and sandpaper-rough voice betrayed
the wear and tear of a tough campaign, did not respond to the
accusations. Chen instead played up his career as an opposition
lawyer and politician.
	   He accused Ma of having defended the martial law regime during a
1980 dissident trial, and said the DPP placed Taiwan's peace and
security above partisan goals.
	   Ma ``defended the rulers, I challenged them,'' Chen told the
television studio audience.
	   The Taipei mayoral race is the most closely watched contest in
Saturday's elections, which also include legislative races and a
mayoral campaign in the southern city of Kaohsiung.
	   Tuesday's debate was the last of five such faceoffs by the
Taipei mayoral candidates.
	   The latest survey results show Chen and Ma in a statistical dead
heat. A poll conducted Sunday by the CTN cable station showed Chen
with 36 percent support against Ma's 37 percent, with 20 percent
still undecided.
	   The survey polled 1,122 adults in Taipei, and had a margin of
error of plus or minus 3 percent.
	   Losing the capital could severely dampen the DPP's hopes of
taking the presidency in 2000. That would mean continued rule by
the Nationalists with their less confrontational policies towards
mainland China.
	   The DPP, of which Chen is a leading member and possible
presidential candidate, advocates Taiwan's formal independence, a
move Beijing warns could provoke it to attack. The mainland views
Taiwan as a renegade province.
	   As the televised debate turned nasty, Chen accused Ma of
halfheartedly cracking down on vice during Ma's term as justice
minister that ended last year. Chen vigorously defended his own
hard line against video games, gambling parlors and the sex
industry.
	   That crackdown has brought a radical decline in juvenile crime
in the capital of 3 million people, Chen claimed.
	   Ma said those policies need fine tuning, and accused the
outspoken mayor of being ``undemocratic'' in pushing his program.
Ma also alluded to the high-profile case of a top Chen aide brought
down for visiting so-called ``hostess bars,'' where clients
sometimes pay for sex.
	   ``If a mayor can't respect the rules, what should we teach our
children?'' said Ma, whose boyish looks and clean record have
earned him the nickname ``sonny-boy Ma.''

Big three absent from Dubai Sevens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Title-holders New Zealand
face a tough challenge from Fiji and Australia in the Dubai
International Rugby Sevens tournament which kicks off here
Thursday.
	   The New Zealanders, who hold the Commonwealth Games gold medal,
will be playing without their skipper and sevens specialist, Eric
Rush, who suffered a calf injury at the last minute.
	   ``Rush's absence is a big blow for us,'' admitted New Zealand
coach Gordon Tietjens. ``But we have been training hard and this is
the best available sevens team.''
	   Dallas Seymour, one of the most durable sevens players in the
world, will be leading New Zealand, who defeated Fiji in the final
here last year.
	   Australia's David Campese and Fiji's Waisale Serevi will also be
absent from the dlrs 50,000 tournament.
	   Campese recently announced his retirement from international
rugby and Serevi, who has led Fiji for the last nine years, could
not obtain leave from his French club to play here.
	   Fiji, with the explosive Marika Vunibaka as their captain, start
as co-favorites to win the 16-nation tournament and the dlrs 25,000
first prize.
	   Australia, led by Jim Williams, will also offer a strong bid for
the title.
	   England is led by former international Rory Underwood. France
has sent a team to Dubai for the first time.
	   Other teams come from Scotland, the United States, Canada,
Zimbabwe, Morocco and Taiwan.
	   The finals are scheduled for Friday.

Gas explosion in Chinese coal mine kills 38
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A gas explosion in a government-run coal mine in
southwestern China killed 38 miners and seriously injured 18
others, the official Beijing Evening News reported Tuesday.
	   More than 80 people were working in the Laibin mine's No. 2
shaft in Yunnan province when the explosion took place Sunday, and
six miners were still unaccounted for, the newspaper said.
	   Miners touched off the gas explosion by dynamiting a shaft in
the mine, the newspaper said. It did not provide further details of
the accident.
	   Work in the Laibin mine, in Yunnan's Xuanwei county, first began
in 1958. It produces about 220,000 tons of coal annually, the
report said.
	   China is the world's biggest producer and user of coal, but is
plagued with legions of mines that are ill-regulated and operated
with outdated equipment. In October alone this year, accidents
killed 157 miners.
	   China has in recent weeks renewed a campaign to improve
management of mines, closing down ones opened without official
permission.
	   The Laibin accident came two days before an earthquake of
preliminary magnitude of 5.1 rocked the area. Tuesday's quake
toppled houses in rural villages and opened cracks in building
walls in the county seat of Xuanwei, a government seismologist
reported.

Asia's social crisis likely to worsen, safety nets needed, ILO
</HEADLINE>
warns &QL; 
 &UR; By MARCOS CALO MEDINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Social instability will worsen unless
governments in battered Asian nations provide long-term social
safety nets for the unemployed, an official of the International
Labor Organization said Tuesday.
	   Unless workers who have been made jobless by the regional
financial crisis have access to minimal income in the form of
unemployment insurance, economic recovery ``is unlikely to return
any time soon, even under the most optimistic scenario.''
	   ``The single biggest element in this crisis is the dramatic rise
in unemployment,'' Eddy Lee, director of the ILO's
Cross-Departmental Analyses and Reports Team, told reporters.
	   Lee prepared the latest ILO report, which surveys the struggling
economies of Indonesia, South Korea, and Thailand. The ILO monitors
labor issues for the United Nations.
	   The absence of unemployment benefits ``has inflicted unnecessary
suffering and hardship'' which can only be remedied with a ``new
and better social contract,'' said the report released Tuesday.
	   As a long-term social safety net, Lee suggested an unemployment
insurance system tailored to the financial capacity of a crisis-hit
country. Both employers and employees would provide money for the
system, splitting a levy on wages equivalent to at least 1 percent
of salaries.
	   Lee noted that among the three countries surveyed, only South
Korea provided laid-off workers with unemployment benefits. Without
any such relief, social unrest and instability ``would have
negative repercussions on the recovery process.'' he said.
	   In Indonesia, the ILO has estimated that by next year about 140
million people _ or two out of three Indonesians _ will be living
in poverty. The Indonesian government has said that the number
could grow even worse if the country's currency, the rupiah, falls
further against the U.S. dollar.
	   The Thai government has predicted that by year's end, there will
be 3 million jobless Thais, triple the number since the Asian
crisis began last summer.
	   Lee noted that many governments mired in recession were
reluctant to increase social spending. He added that the ILO has
not taken up the proposal with multilateral agencies such as the
World Bank or the International Monetary Fund.
	   Critics of such international funding agencies say that the
economic reform packages call for financial restructuring, but they
do little to dampen the social effects of a economic
belt-tightening.
	   Nevertheless, many analysts doubt that the hard-hit Asian
economies will have much cash to spare for laid-off workers.
	   ``To properly administer this program would need a fierce
administrative system. I don't think those systems are in place and
I don't think you can build them overnight,'' said John P. Sevilla,
a vice president at Salomon Smith Barney who focuses on debt
research in Indonesia and South Korea.
	   Lee brushed away criticism over the potential costs deficit
spending in times of economic crisis, saying the plan would
buttress economic restructuring by staving off social unrest with
added security for the jobless.
	   ``The bottom line is the plan is feasible and inexpensive and
will not have large disproportionate effects,'' Lee said.

Bottled babies, skewed skeletons star in Dutch exhibition
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The crooked skeleton with the
gap-toothed grin is waiting at the back of the dimly lit gallery.
To reach him, you have to pass the fetuses of Siamese twins,
eternally joined at the chest and floating in a jar of
formaldehyde.
	   ``Whoa! That's gross,'' 15-year-old Timon Kuijkhoven squealed as
he came upon a deformed baby, with a single eye, in another bottle.
	   Kuijkhoven was among dozens of visitors one day last week
touring ``Up to the Bare Bones,'' an exhibition of human remains
that has transformed the Kunsthal gallery into one macabre museum.
	   Curator Wim Pijbes denies he's running a little shop of horrors.
Instead, he says, the exhibition aims to show the public how and
why the remains ended up in a display case.
	   Most people don't appear to care why. They're only interested in
gazing with a mixture of subdued horror and morbid fascination at
the gruesome exhibits.
	   ``Oh no, it's an arm,'' gasped another visitor, Antje Smits
Schoon, as she peered into a bottle holding what, at first glance,
looks like a thick sausage.
	   In fact, it's the arm and hand of a 3-year-old child, preserved
in formaldehyde and, for an unexplained reason, clutching a leaf.
	   ``The exhibit,'' Smits Schoon declared, ``is pretty weird.''
	   Articles on display include deformed fetuses and skeletons,
religious relics, and works of art fashioned from human hair.
	   There's even the salt-cured tongue of a 17th century Dutch
traitor, held in a little glass-topped coffin along with one of his
brother's toes.
	   The traitors, Johan and Cornelis de Witt, were killed by an
angry mob in The Hague in 1672. Shortly after their deaths, other
bits of their bodies made the rounds of Dutch cafes, where the
regulars checked them out over their foaming beers.
	   The Kunsthal exhibit causing the biggest sensation is the
leathery remains of an Inuit fished out of icy waters near
Greenland by Dutch sailors 200 years ago.
	   Greenland's premier, Jonathan Motzfeldt, has asked the museum to
take the body off display and return it to Greenland for burial.
``It could be the great-grandfather of someone up here,'' he told
Danish television this week.
	   Pijbes has refused, saying museums all over Europe have similar
bodies on display.
	   Meanwhile, the Inuit _ its torso loosely stitched together and
missing its face _ lies in a glass display case next to a mummified
Dutch girl who was dug out of a peat bog.
	   Many of these remains were collected as curiosities by 17th
century Dutch scientists. Others have religious significance, while
some, like the pair of underpants woven out of human hair, have
been created in the name of art.
	   But the bottled remains are the stars of this show.
	   ``Check this out. You can see its brain,'' Kuijkhoven said,
pointing at a baby's head with half the skull cut away.
	   ``It's a bit macabre. I don't really like it.''
	   With that, he went over to look at the crooked skeleton.

U.S. commerce secretary holds trade talks in South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ American business leaders believe
corruption is the greatest obstacle to foreign investment in
Africa, U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley said Tuesday.
	   Daley delivered the assessment at an investment conference
attended by hundreds of U.S. and southern African business
executives and trade officials.
	   Daley said he had asked 15 American business leaders _ including
senior executives from Coca Cola, Chevron, DuPont and Eastman Kodak
_ who were accompanying him what the greatest obstacle to doing
business in Africa was.
	   ``Eighty percent answered with one word: corruption,'' Daley
said, attempting to explain why Africa accounts for only 1 percent
of U.S. trade worldwide, even though the continent has a population
of 800 million.
	   Daley's trip to Africa comes eight months after U.S. President
Bill Clinton visited Africa _ a trip Clinton had hoped would mark
``the beginning of a new African renaissance.''
	   The war in mineral-rich Congo, however, represents an enormous
setback to that vision, Daley said. The fighting between rebels
fighting President Laurent Kabila's government began in August and
involves troops from at least five other countries.
	   ``The fighting in the Congo _ the waste of such great human and
resource potential _ sends the picture to the world of the old
Africa, not the new Africa,'' Daley said, adding: ``You and I know
that business people don't want to buy into the old Africa.''
	   Daley also urged southern African nations to accelerate their
efforts to make the 14-nation Southern African Development
Community a free-trade zone within eight years. He noted that so
far, only five countries have ratified the trade protocol.
	   ``For Africa to be on the global stage, it cannot be small
disconnected markets. It must be regional markets,'' he said.
	   Daley's delegation leaves Wednesday for Nigeria, Kenya and the
Ivory Coast.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Daley and South African Trade Minister Alec
Erwin signed an agreement to promote investment between American
and South African companies.
	   The memorandum of understanding will see Investment South
Africa, the government investment promotion agency, and the
Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a company which sells
political risk insurance and financing to U.S. companies, jointly

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Spanish striker Raul Gonzalez scored with eight
minutes remaining and gave Real Madrid a 2-1 victory over Brazil's
Vasco da Gama on Tuesday for its first Toyota Cup title since 1960.
	   Gonzalez settled Clarence Seedorf's cross before scoring, giving
Real the crown for the first time since it won the inaugural trophy
38 years ago.
	   An own goal by Nasa off a cross from Roberto Carlos gave Real
the lead in the 25th minute, but Vasco drew even in the 56th on a
goal by Juninho.
	   The game was played before 51,000 spectators at Japan's National
Stadium in downtown Tokyo.

Libya apparently violates U.N. sanctions with flight to Chad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A Libyan plane flew to Chad on Tuesday,
apparently violating U.N. sanctions that ban flights to and from
the North African nation, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   The plane was carrying a delegation from the Libyan General
People's Congress, which serves as the country's legislature, to
the Chadian capital of N'Djamena, MENA said in a dispatch from the
Libyan capital Tripoli.
	   It said the Libyans would participate in the 6th anniversary
celebration of Chad's revolution.
	   The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions in 1992, including a
flight ban, to try to force Libya hand over two suspects wanted in
the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am passenger jet over Lockerbie, Scotland
that killed 270 people.
	   African countries voted in June to ignore the flight ban. Since
then, a number of African leaders have flown to Libya.
	   The latest was Djibouti's president, Hassan Gouled Aptidon, who
arrived in Libya on Monday.
	   Libya from time to time has sent jets out of the country,
especially for official visits to African nations. It also has sent
planes to Saudi Arabia carrying Libyan pilgrims to the annual hajj.

Lawyer says ``distressed'' Pinochet about to leave hospital

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet is distressed at demands by
a London hospital that he leave and he will likely move to a new
location later Tuesday, the former Chilean dictator's British
attorney said.
	   Pincohet had planned to move on Monday from the Grovelands
Priory, a private psychiatric hospital in north London where he has
been under police guard since Oct. 29, but the arrangement fell
through because of ``unforeseen practical difficulties,'' said
lawyer Michael Caplan.
	   The hospital announced Monday afternoon that there is nothing
wrong with Pinochet and he should go _ dealing a blow to any plan
by the 83-year-old general to plead he is too ill to be extradited
to Spain to stand trial on charges of genocide and torture.
	   Adding to his troubles, an opinion poll published Tuesday
indicated that a narrow majority _ 51 percent _ of Britons think
Pinochet should be extradited.
	   ``Senator Pinochet and his family are distressed by reports
yesterday concerning the senator's stay in at Groveland Priory
Hospital,'' said Caplan.
	   He said he received court approval on Friday to vary bail
conditions and ``it is anticipated the move will take place later
today.''
	   Pinochet's supporters have said they are looking for a secure
and comfortable home where he can stay while he fights extradition.
	   A Chilean government report says some 3,000 people were murdered
or disappeared at the hands of the secret police during Pinochet's
1970-93 rule.
	   But Chile is trying to get him back because of fears that the
anger of his supporters may destabilize its democracy.
	   Chile's foreign minister Jose Miguel Insulza was in Spain
Tuesday, after lobbying British officials, arguing that Pinochet
may be tried in Chile if he is freed.
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw has until Dec. 11 to decide whether
the extradition proceedings can go ahead.
	   British newspapers have speculated that Pinochet is seeking to
move to a nine-bedroom home on a luxurious estate, in Surrey, near
the Wentworth Golf Club, home of the European golf tour, about 20
miles (30 kms) west of central London.
	   Wherever he goes, Pinochet is likely to cause disruption.
Chilean exiles mount demonstration, and there is a police guard and
heavy police presence.
	   In addition, The Guardian newspaper, quoting unidentified
Grovelands Priory officials, said the general is a fussy and
complaining patient.
	   A National Opinion poll published in London's Evening Standard
said 51 percent of a 961-strong sample of voters questioned
nationwide said Pinochet should be extradited, 32 percent wanted
him sent home and the rest had no opinion. The error margin was
plus or minus three percent.
	   A statement by U.S. State Department James P. Rubin Monday that
the international community should show ``significant respect'' for
Chile's point of view was widely interpreted in British newspapers
as a nod toward Straw to let Pinochet go.
	   On Monday, Pinochet's nephew Rafael Saavedra Pinochet denied a
report in a British tabloid, The Mirror, that he had said his uncle
would rather die than face trial in Spain.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Government officials and health advocates marked
World AIDS Day on Tuesday with calls for urgent efforts to stop the
galloping spread of the disease.
	   In India, which with 3 to 5 million HIV-infected people has been
among the hardest hit nations, hundreds of school children marched
beside prostitutes in the capital to draw attention to the
epidemic.
	   Joining them was Jacqueline Lundquist, wife of U.S. Ambassador
Richard Celeste, who wore a white t-shirt emblazoned with the
familiar AIDS awareness logo of a loop of red ribbon.
	   ``It's extraordinarily important that everyone get involved in
the AIDS awareness campaign, but particularly young people, because
this is the next generation,'' she said.
	   Activists in the African nation of Kenya distributed condoms and
pamphlets on AIDS prevention in Dandora, a slum in the capital,
Nairobi.
	   Sande Harrison, a social worker for Doctors Without Borders,
said the AIDS victims she helps provide with home care in Dandora
``are in a very pathetic situation. Often there are no neighbors
willing to help and no relatives. I feel very helpless and it is
traumatic seeing people like this every day.''
	   Many Kenyans believe AIDS is caused by witchcraft, so they fail
to take precautions against contracting the disease, she said.
	   In Japan, the Health Ministry organized rallies and charity
concerts in a central Tokyo square to publicize the threat of AIDS
and demonstrate support with those suffering from the disease.
	   ``It's extremely important to have an event every year to
repeatedly remind people that AIDS exists,'' said Dr. Yoshiki
Sakurai, an official of the Japanese Foundation for AIDS
Prevention.
	   Discrimination against AIDS sufferers remains powerful in Japan,
and the country still lags behind many Western countries in AIDS
treatment facilities and education, Sakurai said.
	   In Hong Kong, bars, restaurants and nightclubs handed out
coasters encouraging safe-sex practices. The effort was part of a
three-week AIDS awareness campaign organized by the group, AIDS
Concern.
	   The coasters feature pictures of a fluorescent condom on one
side, with a safe sex message on the reverse side. One version of
the coaster reads: ``Do it safely; use a condom every time.''
	   Experts have warned recently that while powerful new drugs have
sent AIDS deaths plunging in industrialized countries, the disease
continues to kill millions of people in the impoverished nations of
Africa and Asia.
	   President Clinton planned to mark AIDS day with the announcement
of dlrs 10 million in emergency grants to help poorer nations care
for children orphaned by AIDS.
	   According to a new U.N. report, about 33.4 million people around
the world are infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
Two-thirds of the afflicted are in sub-Saharan Africa, where 2
million people will die of the disease south of the Sahara this
year, four times the total for the rest of the world.
	   Adult HIV infection rates in Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland and
Zimbabwe are between 20 percent and 25 percent, the United Nations
says.
	   About 1.7 million people in Africa and 700,000 people in Asia
and the Pacific are infected with HIV every year, according to U.N.
figures.
	   The Cambodian government marked AIDS day with the grim
announcement that 150,000 people _ 1.3 percent of the population _
are infected with the AIDS virus.
	   Officials said that 50 to 70 people contract HIV in Cambodia
every day, the highest HIV infection rate in Asia.
	   The economic crisis sweeping through Southeast Asia has made it
even more difficult for governments in the region to curb the
spread of AIDS.
	   On the eve of AIDS day, Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa
launched a plea at the United Nations for governments around the
world to contribute more funds to the worldwide fight against AIDS.
	   ``We aren't doing enough to say to governments, `For goodness
sake, why have so much money for death and so little for life?'''
Tutu said

U.N.: Fighting sends Congolese streaming into Tanzania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Fighting in southeastern Congo has led to a new
wave of Congolese refugees crossing Lake Tanganyika into Tanzania,
the U.N. refugee agency said Tuesday.
	   Several hundred refugees each day have been arriving in port
villages in Tanzania's Rukwa region since mid-November, said Kris
Janowski, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
	   The new arrivals say fighting in Congo's Shaba region, as well
as looting and the fear of being pressed into military service, are
behind the exodus, Janowski said.
	   Around 50 refugees a day were arriving in the second week of
November. But over the following week, some 2,500 crossed into
Tanzania.
	   No adequate shelter is available in the lakeside villages for
the refugees and their situation is being made worse by
increasingly heavy rain.
	   UNHCR has transferred 1,200 refugees north from their arrival
points to Kigoma, where camps are already established.
	   More than 18,000 people have fled Congo for Tanzania during the
four-month conflict between forces loyal to President Laurent
Kabila and rebels based in Congo's eastern regions, the agency
says.
	   Namibia, Zimbabwe and Angola are supporting Kabila against the
rebels, who have the backing of Rwanda and Uganda.

Most of archeological digs in Israel halted over budget dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Archeology, one of Israel's biggest tourist
attractions, suffered a blow Tuesday when most of its excavations
were shut down.
	   The Israel Antiquities Authority halted its salvage digs _
carried out ahead of most construction projects _ after the Supreme
Court ruled that developers and builders cannot be billed for these
excavations.
	   In the country of Jesus and King Solomon, Richard the Lion Heart
and Saladin, it is almost impossible to start a building or a road
without uncovering ancient remains.
	   In response to a petition from a developer, however, the Supreme
Court ruled Sunday that the government, not the builder, must bear
the costs of the salvage digs, operated by the Antiquities
Authority.
	   In response, the Antiquities Authority decided Tuesday to halt
all salvage digs which account for about 300 of the 350 excavations
carried out in Israel each year.
	   ``We have no budget for salvage digs,'' said Antiquities
Authority spokeswoman Osnat Gouez.
	   Major digs open to the public like those in Jerusalem, Caesarea
and Beit Shean have been drastically curtailed for lack of
government funding, Gouez said.
	   In the archeological sense, Israel is the one of the most
crowded countries in the world, with some 25,000 known sites
excavated or waiting to be dug up.

U.S. commerce secretary: corruption hinders U.S. trade with Africa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 6th graf to delete redundant word ``fighting''; UPDATES
overline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ American business leaders believe
corruption is the greatest obstacle to foreign investment in
Africa, U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley said Tuesday.
	   Daley delivered the assessment at an investment conference
attended by hundreds of U.S. and southern African business
executives and trade officials.
	   Daley said he had asked 15 American business leaders _ including
senior executives from Coca Cola, Chevron, DuPont and Eastman Kodak
_ who were accompanying him what the greatest obstacle to doing
business in Africa was.
	   ``Eighty percent answered with one word: corruption,'' Daley
said, attempting to explain why Africa accounts for only 1 percent
of U.S. trade worldwide, even though the continent has a population
of 800 million.
	   Daley's trip to Africa comes eight months after U.S. President
Bill Clinton visited Africa _ a trip Clinton had hoped would mark
``the beginning of a new African renaissance.''
	   The war in mineral-rich Congo, however, represents an enormous
setback to that vision, Daley said. The war between rebels fighting
President Laurent Kabila's government began in August and involves
troops from at least five other countries.

Sharp drops on European exchanges after Wall Street, Asian dips
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING for those needing
 &UR; With BC-Asian Markets-Stocks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Share prices dropped sharply on European stock
exchanges Tuesday, following big falls on Wall Street and in Asian
markets.
	   The London Stock Exchange, Europe's largest, set the pace with a
fall of 2.6 percent on the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index.
	   Blue-chip indexes were down 3.2 percent in Germany, 3.4 percent
in Paris, 3.2 percent in Oslo, 2.7 percent in Zurich and Stockholm,
2.6 percent in Amsterdam, and 2.3 percent in Milan and Madrid.
	   ``There was just nothing supportive out there,'' said Peter
Caulkett of Teather-and-Greenwood in London. ``But there is a
feeling that stocks had come up too far too soon and investors are
now running scared.''
	   On Wall Street Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.3
percent in the first big wave of profit-taking since the market
recovered strongly two months ago.
	   Asian markets followed the trend, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng
Index down 4.1 percent Tuesday, and Singapore's Straits Times Index
off 3.4 percent. Tokyo was an exception, with a mild 0.3 percent
decline in the Nikkei 225-stock average.
	   Local concerns contributed to the drops on some European
exchanges.
	   Analysts in Frankfurt said the 3.2 drop on the Xetra DAX index
partly reflected disappointment with Deustche Bank's announcement
that it expected no immediate savings from its takeover of Bankers
Trust, a U.S. investment bank. Deutsche Bank's shares fell 2.7
percent in the morning.
	   In Paris the CAC-40 index was down 3.4 percent, led by 9.9
percent plunge in shares of Total. Investors deserted the petroleum
company after is announced it was getting back into the refinery
sector by acquiring Petrofina of Belgium.
	   The Swiss Market Index was 2.7 lower, in part because of
profit-taking in the financial sector and a switch toward buying
pharmaceutical stocks.

Hong Kong to launch stock market for smaller companies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ In an effort to secure Hong Kong's position as
Asia's second largest financial center, the territory's stock
exchange said Tuesday it will start up a new market to help smaller
companies raise cash from investors.
	   The ``Growth Enterprise Market,'' or GEM, aims to entice small-
and medium-sized companies from Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland
China to list their shares on the new index, a statement from the
exchange said.
	   It will have less stringent listing rules and profit
requirements, but will enjoy equal standing to the main board,
market executives said.
	   ``Developing an effective GEM for Hong Kong, mainland and
Taiwan's medium-sized companies offers valuable economic benefits,
and will secure Hong Kong's position as the preeminent market for
such enterprises,'' said K.S. Lo, a vice-chairman of the Stock
Exchange Council, who is leading the team creating the new market.
	   Hong Kong's market is smaller than the region's top bourse in
Tokyo, but is locked in an often-intense rivalry with Asia's No. 3
player, Singapore.
	   The Hong Kong exchange wants to launch its smaller market in
late 1999.
	   The minimum amount of stock which can be offered on the new
exchange would either be 38 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
4.87 million) or 10 percent of a company, whichever is higher. The
proposed minimum transaction size is 50,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 6,410).
	   Lo defended the decision to set a minimum transaction size.
	   ``Because of the higher risk of this market, we want to target
informed investors,'' Lo said. ``We don't want to see too much
speculation by retail investors.''
	   He did not, however, rule out the possibility of reducing the
minimum requirement once the secondary market is better
established.
	   He said sponsors of potential listing candidates will be
responsible for the initial public offering disclosure and the
stock exchange will make no assessment of applicant's commercial
viability for listing.
	   Listed companies would be required to submit quarterly reports
which may be unaudited. Corporate governance requirements will
include the appointment of an audit committee, a qualified
accountant and at least two independent directors.
	   ``Compliance will be strictly monitored, and penalties for
non-compliance will be high,'' Lo added.
	   In a separate development, the stock exchange also said Tuesday
it has agreed to turn itself into a public body, subjecting itself
to scrutiny by the territory's independent anti-corruption body.
	   H.C. Lee, chairman of the stock exchange, said the exchange will
allow its executives and managers to be accountable as public
servants to the Independent Commission Against Corruption, but
plans to exclude its ordinary broker members from such scrutiny.
	   The decision is a turnaround from the exchange's earlier stance,
when it stood firmly against placing itself under the anti-graft
body's scrutiny, as public servants and public bodies in Hong Kong
have been since the body was created in the mid-1970s.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Contractors bidding on a Jewish housing project
in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem visited the site Tuesday, and
police detained three protesters from the Peace Now group trying to
disrupt the tour.
	   Peace Now leader Mossi Raz struggled and yelled as police
carried him into a police van. Police and soldiers also scuffled
with several other Peace Now activists as they tried to approach
the construction site.
	   The Jewish neighborhood of Har Homa, consisting of 6,500
apartments, is being built in east Jerusalem, on land Israel
captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   The Palestinians hope to establish a future capital in east
Jerusalem. They say Har Homa is part of an Israeli plan to cut off
the Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem from their hinterland in
Bethlehem and the southern West Bank.
	   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart has called the project
``inconsistent with the spirit'' of last month's Wye River peace
agreement.
	   On Tuesday, several Israeli builders interested in being awarded
contracts at Har Homa toured the site in a convoy of cars.
	   Fifteen Peace Now activists protesting against the construction
plans were barred by police from entering the site.
	   Five members of the outlawed anti-Arab Kach group demonstrated
next to Peace Now, chanting, ``Peace Now, a knife in the back.''
	   Israel maintains that Jerusalem must remain under exclusive
Israeli sovereignty. Prime Minister Netanyahu has promised that the
first homes in Har Homa would be completed in 2000.
	   Ground-breaking for Har Homa, known in Arabic as Jabal Abu
Ghneim, led to Palestinian rioting last year and a 19-month
stalemate in the peace negotiations.
	   Also on Tuesday, The Jerusalem Post newspaper reported that the
Israeli government has approved the construction of 480 additional
homes in the Jewish settlement of Kohav Yaacov in the West Bank.
	   Housing Ministry spokesman Moshe Friedman, however, said that no
such decision had been made. Friedman said that the construction of
230 apartments in the settlement has been under way for a year and
that the ground breaking for the other 250 apartments will begin in
the next few days.

Kremlin wants to condemn Bolsheviks for 1917 revolution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An aide to President Boris Yeltsin urged
prosecutors Tuesday to investigate the Bolsheviks for carrying out
the 1917 revolution _ a move apparently intended to discourage
their successors.
	   Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff Yevgeny Savostyanov spoke at a
meeting of the presidential commission set up to fight political
extremism.
	   The prosecutors should give a ``legal assessment of the
Bolshevik action to seize power,'' Savostyanov was quoted by the
Interfax news agency as saying.
	   The statement reflected the government's concern about the
increasing aggressiveness of the Communist Party, which has the
largest faction in the Russian parliament and enjoys broad
nationwide support.
	   The Communists have also led a panel in parliament seeking to
impeach Yeltsin _ and among the charges they are investigating is
his role in instigating the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, the
Bolsheviks' creation.
	   In the latest embarrassment to the Kremlin, the Communists
recently won a sweeping victory in local elections in the southern
Krasnodar region.
	   Krasnodar Governor Nikolai Kondratenko, a Communist, has often
indulged in anti-Semitic and anti-government rhetoric. Communist
lawmaker Albert Makashov recently sparked an uproar with his
outspoken anti-Semitism.
	   The Communist Party rebuked Makashov only grudgingly after
strong pressure in Russia and abroad. Makashov enjoys legal
immunity as a lawmaker, and the government hasn't yet moved to
persecute him.
	   Kondratenko, meanwhile, has been invited to the Justice Ministry
for a ``conversation,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Tuesday.
	   The presidential panel on Tuesday discussed possible amendments
to Russian laws to crack down on political extremism.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin is feeling better, but is
still spending part of the day in a hospital bed as he continues to
be treated for pneumonia, officials said Tuesday.
	   A Kremlin spokesman said the president was doing limited
paperwork and there were no plans for any meetings or visitors. He
did not say how much longer Yeltsin would remain in the government
hospital where he has been for 10 days.
	   Yeltsin's first deputy chief of staff Oleg Sysuyev said on
Tuesday that the president is expected to return to work at the
Kremlin ``in the nearest time.''
	   ``Doctors are having trouble keeping the president in the
hospital,'' Sysuyev said at a news conference.
	   The 67-year-old leader is known as a restless patient who
sometimes ignores the advice of his doctors.
	   Yeltsin met his chief-of-staff Valentin Yumashev in the hospital
Monday and was briefed on government and national affairs.
	   On Tuesday, the president spoke by telephone with Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, who discussed the agenda of his talks with
International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus set to arrive in
Moscow later today.

Israeli defense minister: Greece turned down maneuver offer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said
Tuesday that Greece turned down his invitation to carry out a joint
operation in the Mediterranean after Israel and Turkey held similar
exercises in the area.
	   ``We invited them to a humanitarian exercise at sea more than a
year ago and they refused,'' Mordechai said, according to his
spokesman, Avi Benayahu.
	   ``They were invited once again to hold such an exercise'' during
the visit on Tuesday of the Greek air force commander, Lt. Gen.
Giorgos Antonetzis, to Israel, Benayahu said. Benayahu did not say
how the Greek visitor responded.
	   Turkey is Greece's traditional rival, and Greece has been
watching the growing Israeli-Turkish military alliance with some
concern.
	   Turkey and Greece remain at odds over Cyprus. They have
controlled opposite sides of the island since 1974, when Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island after a
failed coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   Mordechai said he supported a diplomatic solution to the Cyprus
conflict.
	   The Greek air force commander was to stay in Israel until
Thursday night as a guest of the Israeli air force. He was to meet
military officials and tour defense industry facilities, the
Israeli army spokesman's office said.
	   The Greek air force already has several defense contracts with
Israel, including the maintenance of F-16 fighter planes.
	   Mordechai will visit Greece at the end of December as a guest of
the Greek Jewish community. He will hold military and policy
meetings in Athens and in the northern port city of Salonica.

High-tech reveals pharaonic capital in Nile Delta
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Using magnetic sensors and computers,
Egyptian experts have located and mapped an important pharaonic
city in the Nile Delta, officials said Tuesday.
	   Ahmed Gouda Husain of the Geophysical Research Center said the
experts have been able to create detailed images of Qantir, which
was a capital of one of Egypt's most famous kings, Ramses II.
	   Ramses II, a pharaoh in the so-called New Kingdom era, ruled
Egypt from 1304 to 1237 B.C.
	   ``It's a complete town with all its palaces, houses, streets and
stables,'' Husain told The Associated Press.
	   Husain said the team he heads has been using magnetic sensors to
survey the city, which also served as the capital of the Hyksos
invaders for nearly a hundred years.
	   He said that surveying the city _ covering a square kilometer
(about half a square mile) of cotton, corn and wheat fields _ took
about 45 days.
	   The team used a piece of equipment known as a ``graduometre,''
which was provided by a German foundation, to measure electric
impulses and magnetic levels at the site, Husain said.
	   Husain, a geophysicist who has been working in archaeology for
15 years, said the team later put the readings into a computer to
generate images of the city.
	   Qantir, some 114 kilometers (76 miles) north of Cairo, is
covered with sandy mounds that archeologists believe cover a number
of pharaonic sites.
	   Gaballah Ali Gaballah, head of Egypt's Supreme Council for
Antiquities, said the site was discovered in the 1920s. He said it
would require at least 20 years of excavations to unearth the main
sections of the city.
	   Husain said his team has used high-tech equipment to make a
number of important archaeological discoveries in Egypt.
	   In Sohag in the south, for example, they found tombs and 12
buried solar boats, designed to carry the dead in their after
lives.

EU: Rabies to disappear soon, perhaps so will UK, Irish quarantine
</HEADLINE>
laws &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission had good news
Tuesday for pet lovers planning to move to Britain or Ireland:
rabies will soon disappear from the EU which may prod both
countries to end their tough pet quarantine laws.
	   ``It can be confidently predicted rabies will be eliminated from
the EU within the not too distant future, the commission said.
	   It said only 30 cases were reported in 1998 in Germany, the EU's
most infected country, down from 3,534 in 1991.
	   The commission granted dlrs 3.5 million to a campaign to
eradicate rabies altogether and ``contribute to dismantling
quarantine for pets when they and their owners travel to the United
Kingdom or Ireland.''
	   Newcomers to both countries must board their pets for six months
in quarantine kennels as part of strict anti-rabies laws.
	   Dog and cat lovers say that is expensive and cruel.
	   As an alternative, Britain is already considering a plan to
insert microchips under the skin of pets so they can be identified
by an electronic scanner on arrival. Each pet would also have a
passport-style document listing vaccinations against diseases.
	   However, that would apply only to pets from other EU countries.
	   Americans and other non-Europeans would still have to put their
animals into quarantine.
	   The commission's anti-rabies campaign contribution is part of a
total expenditure of 50.75 million European currency units (dlrs
58.4 million) to help combat a dozen or so animal diseases such as
Classical and African swine fever, scrapie and brucellosis in cows,
sheep and goats.
	   ``Funding of most programs will be concentrated on compensating
farmers for the slaughter of infected animals,'' the Commission
said.

Medical tests point to doping at Festina
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ Medical tests suggest that cyclists on the
Festina team, expelled from the Tour de France this summer, took
banned drugs, the French judge investigating the case said Tuesday.
	   But top Festina cyclist Richard Virenque said the figures
released by judge Patrick Keil vindicate his claim that he did not
take banned substances.
	   Keil called Virenque and teammates Pascal Herve and Laurent
Brochard to Lille to give them the results of tests carried out in
July.
	   They showed that Virenque had a high hematocrit level of 49.3
percent. The hematocrit level measures the proportion of red blood
cells in a blood sample _ one sign of doping, since the substances
increase red blood cells.
	   But Virenque's level is just within the limit of 50 percent set
by the International Cycling Union, the sport's governing body.
	   Medical experts have been analyzing blood, urine and hair tests
since Festina team manager Bruno Roussel admitted during the race
to the use of the banned substance erythropoietin (EPO) among
cyclists.
	   Virenque and Herve both deny they knowingly took any banned
subtances.

Chinese court orders police officer put to death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Chinese court has sentenced a deputy police
chief to death for fatally shooting a passerby during a gambling
raid, the official Workers' Daily reported Tuesday.
	   The Liuzhou No. 1 Intermediate People's Court in the southern
Guangxi region also ordered Hongdu township deputy police chief Zhu
Kehan to pay 8,000 yuan (dlrs 970) to Lan Rimin's family, the
newspaper said.
	   Lan, a truck driver, unwittingly entered the Leyi restaurant
during the raid Zhu led on the suspected gambling parlor on April
21, the newspaper said. Hearing Zhu in a rage, Lan ran out and the
deputy police chief drew his pistol and fired, the report said.
	   Although Zhu reported the shooting, the court noted that his
conduct had a pernicious effect on society and issued the death
sentence ``to calm the people's anger,'' Workers' Daily said.

Nick Faldo reported to have new girlfriend
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Nick Faldo is back in the tabloid headlines _ not
for his golf, but his private life.
	   The Sun ran a front-page story Tuesday saying Faldo, a
three-time winner of both the British Open and Masters, has a new
girlfriend.
	   The woman was identified as 25-year-old Swiss public relations
executive Valerie Bercher.
	   ``Faldo's Swiss Miss,'' was The Sun's headline.
	   The paper said the two met at a recent tournament in
Switzerland.
	   ``We have been a couple for the past few weeks,'' The Sun quoted
Bercher as saying. ``It's just the beginning but we are very happy
together.''
	   ``Nick has a bad reputation for being a very cold man,'' she
added. ``But I have found this to be completely untrue.
	   The story came out just weeks after Faldo announced his breakup
with American girlfriend Brenna Cepelak.
	   Faldo, 41, was divorced in October from his second wife, Gill.
They had been married 12 years.
	   The Sun reported that Cepalak, 23, smashed Faldo's Porsche with
a golf club when he broke up with her in October, causing 10,000
pounds (dlrs 16,500) in damage.
	   Faldo, mired in a deep slump, had one of his few recent
successes when he played on England's winning team in the World Cup
of Golf last month in New Zealand.

Government leases U.S. F-16 fighters but defers Aussie frigate
</HEADLINE>
purchase
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Bowing to public opposition, New
Zealand's government on Tuesday deferred buying a third Australian
naval frigate, but leased 28 U.S. fighter planes and authorized a
major army equipment upgrade.
	   The decision surprised some observers, convinced Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley's minority National Party government would push ahead
with the frigate purchase despite opinion polls showing 75 percent
of voters opposed the deal.
	   Shipley announced the replacement of the 30-year old Skyhawk
fleet with 28 F-16 fighter planes leased from the United States for
200 million New Zealand dollars (U.S. dlrs 105 million).
	   The government will upgrade the army with 500 more men and
re-equip it with modern equipment at a cost of 500 million New
Zealand dollars (US dlrs 265 million), she said.
	   The Labor opposition cast immediate doubt on the F-16 fighter
deal, warning it might not honor any agreement between New Zealand
and the United States to lease the planes if it wins government.
	   A general election is due before November 1999, and Labor
presently holds a 16 percent lead in opinion polls.
	   The re-equipment decisions triggered the resignation of
independent legislator Deborah Morris, trimming the government's
majority to 61-59 in the 120-seat Parliament.
	   Shipley and Defense Minister Max Bradford said they had decided
against the Australian frigate purchase for cost reasons.
	   But Shipley said the government had also ``listened to New
Zealand'' and taken into account public opinion against a further
frigate purchase. Two were bought by a Labor government in the late
1980s.
	   The decision not to buy a third frigate leaves a question mark
over whether New Zealand will retain a three-frigate navy once its
aging Leander-class frigate is decommissioned in about 2005.
	   A decision will need to be made by 2002.
	   Bradford said the government's top priority had been to re-equip
the army. He had not been able to convince Cabinet colleagues that
the government could afford to upgrade the army while also buying
another frigate and leasing the F-16 fighters.

Four Ukrainian children in coma after movie theater stampede
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHERVONOHRAD, Ukraine (AP) _ Four Ukrainian schoolchildren were
in comas Tuesday after a movie theater stampede that occurred the
day before, killing four children, hospital officials said.
	   Seven other children were also still hospitalized after the
accident in a movie theater in the town of Chervonohrad, 450
kilometers (279 miles) west of the capital Kiev.
	   Four children, aged between 11 and 14, were crushed to death as
they were leaving the theater and collided on a narrow, steep
stairway with other students rushing forward to find seats for the
American movie ``Armageddon.''
	   Police have not determined who was to blame for the deaths,
Oleksiy Brukh of Chervonohrad's municipal council told the Interfax
news agency. The Emergency Situations Ministry, however, blamed
movie theater personnel for violating safety rules.
	   ``Armageddon'' has been one of the most popular films in Ukraine
for several months, and the theater was the only one showing the
film in Chervonohrad.
	   About 800 children from five schools in Chervonohrad came to the
two afternoon showings of the film _ the one that was ending when
the accident occurred and the one that was about to start.
	   President Leonid Kuchma sent a telegram of condolences and
ordered local authorities to assist the families that lost their
children.

Hoechst, Rhone-Poulenc announce agreement to merge

 &UR; Eds: ADDS quote from Rhone-Poulenc chairman just before news
conference, UPDATES Rhone-Poulenc share price

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Two of Europe's largest drug makers, Hoechst of
Germany and Rhone-Poulenc of France, announced Tuesday they are
merging their pharmaceutical and agrochemical operations.
	   The new company will be called Aventis and will be based in
Strasbourg, eastern France.
	   The move was a step toward a full merger between the French and
German companies, which should be completed within three years,
said Rhone-Poulenc chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou. Analysts have warned
against a full merger until the heavily indebted firms reduce
costs.
	   ``Unlike what has happened to other companies in our industry,
the creation of Aventis _ provided we obtain all the necessary
authorizations _ will be translated into reality,'' Fourtou said
ahead of a news conference in Strasbourg.
	   A statement released by the two companies said it was
``anticipated'' that Hoechst Chairman Jurgen Dormann would be the
new chairman of Aventis, and Fourtu the vice chairman.
	   With annual sales of around dlrs 20 billion, the new company
will be tied for the No. 1 ranking with Switzerland's Novartis in
the life-sciences sector.
	   The two companies said they expected annual cost savings of dlrs
1.2 billion in three years, with 60 percent of those generated in
their pharmaceutical operations and 40 percent in agrochemicals.
	   Unions in France and Germany have been critical of the merger,
fearing layoffs. Hoechst employs 118,000 workers and Rhone-Poulenc,
68,000.
	   Rhone Poulenc shares were 4.2 percent lower to 271.8 francs
(dlrs 47.70) per share in afternoon trading as investors expressed
displeasure that a full merger hadn't been announced.

China calls for release of fishermen captured in Philippines
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES 6th-9th grafs with comments by Philippine officials.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China on Tuesday called for the immediate release
of 20 Chinese fishermen arrested by a Philippine navy patrol near
the disputed Spratly Islands.
	   The Chinese government is very concerned, views the detentions
as illegal and wants Manila to take measures to avoid such arrests
in the future, Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang said at a
twice-weekly briefing.
	   The Philippine patrol arrested 20 Chinese fishermen and seized
their six boats on Sunday near the Alicia Annie Reef, which is
claimed by both the Philippines and China.
	   A Philippine navy officer, Maj. Romulo Gualdrapa, said Monday
they were arrested for illegally fishing in Philippine territory
and using sodium cyanide to catch fish in violation of a Philippine
law that bans the practice.
	   Cyanide is added to sea water by some fishermen to stun fish so
they can be caught and sold alive to restaurants. Cyanide kills
many other fish and destroys coral reefs.
	   In Manila, Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said the Chinese
fishermen's mother ship refused to stop and headed for the Mischief
Reef, part of the Spratly Islands.
	   ``So it appears that Mischief Reef is now becoming a haven of
these illegal fishermen,'' Mercado said.
	   Presidential Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said the Chinese
fishermen will be released.
	   ``They will be detained for a short period. They will lectured
to about not violating the exclusive economic zone of the
Philippines, and then after an appropriate time they will be let
off,'' he said.
	   The arrests were the latest in a series of recent incidents
between Manila and Beijing over territories in the South China Sea.
	   The Spratlys are believed to be rich in oil, gas and minerals.
China, Vietnam and Taiwan claim all of the Spratlys, while the
Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei claim parts of the chain.

Repairs at Chernobyl nuclear reactor delayed over energy shortages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from top regulatory official, 4th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Energy shortages have forced Ukraine to
postpone repairs on the sole operational reactor at the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant by at least two weeks, officials said Tuesday.
	   Chernobyl's reactor No. 3 would be operating until Dec. 15
before energy authorities decide whether to stop it, a spokesman
with the state nuclear energy company Energoatom said.
	   Ukraine's Nuclear Regulation Administration earlier this month
ordered the reactor be shut down Tuesday, warning that some safety
equipment was reaching the end of its operational life and needed
to be upgraded or replaced.
	   The Nuclear Regulation Administration chief, Oleksander
Smyshliaev, said his agency has decided to grant Energoatom's
request to prolong the reactor's work, but stressed that it has to
be stopped as soon as possible.
	   There have been frequent malfunctions at the reactor despite
lengthy repairs between July 1997 and May 1998. Another Chernobyl
reactor was destroyed in a 1986 explosion and fire, the world's
worst nuclear accident.
	   However, the Energy Ministry has repeatedly protested the order
to shut down the working reactor, saying it was needed until the
spring to ensure enough electricity for the winter months.
	   Energoatom warned Monday that the shutdown of the Chernobyl
reactor would force energy authorities to cut off entire regions in
Ukraine to make up for the energy loss.
	   Ukraine faces a huge energy deficit this winter because
conventional energy plants, collectively owed more than dlrs 1
billion by consumers, can't afford enough fuel to satisfy the
demand for electricity and heat.
	   Thousands of towns and villages in Ukraine already go without
electricity for several hours every day as temperatures throughout
much of the country have sunk below -15 C (5 F).
	   Ukrainian officials hope that three of five other nuclear
reactors currently undergoing repairs would be restarted by Dec.
15, which would allow them to stop the Chernobyl reactor. Ukraine's
five nuclear power plants operate 14 reactors.
	   Western nations have long demanded the shutdown of the working
Chernobyl reactor amid growing worries over its safety. Reactor No.
3 has been Chernobyl's only working reactor since 1996.

French court to decide fate of American fugitive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with court announcing ruling will be given Jan. 12 &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN PHILLIPS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ American fugitive Ira Einhorn appeared
in court Tuesday for a hearing to determine whether he'll be
extradited to the United States for the brutal 1977 murder of his
girlfriend. The court said it would rule on Jan. 12.
	   Einhorn, 57, has been sentenced in absentia to life in prison by
a Pennsylvania court for the murder of Helen ``Holly'' Maddux _ a
crime he denies, even though police found her corpse stuffed in a
trunk in his closet.
	   A prominent anti-war campaigner and New Age activist in the
1960s, Einhorn fled the United States shortly before he was due to
be tried. But after 16 years in hiding, he was tracked down and
arrested at his French home in June 1997.
	   Einhorn entered the court building Tuesday holding hands with
his companion, Anika Flodin, and refused to answer questions.
	   But the victim's sister, Elisabeth Hall, accompanied by other
family members, was more outspoken.
	   ``We are here in France to remind the judges that underneath all
this international law and political squabbling, there is a person
who was murdered and who looks like us,'' Hall said.
	   ``Anybody can see there has been a definite undercurrent of
anti-Americanism,'' she said.
	   After a French court refused to extradite Einhorn in December
1997, citing a French law that would have required a retrial if he
was extradited, Pennsylvania passed a law promising Einhorn a
retrial. He was re-arrested in September.
	   His defense lawyers argue that, if extradited, Einhorn could
face the death penalty, which is banned under French law. They also
claim Pennsylvania courts might withdraw the pledge of a retrial.
	   In a November interview on ABC television, Einhorn proclaimed
his innocence and claimed the CIA or KGB framed him after he
uncovered classified mind-control experiments.
	   When Maddux, a former cheerleader from Tyler, Texas,
disappeared, Einhorn said she had gone shopping and never returned.
	   But when neighbors 18 months later told police of a stench
coming from Einhorn's apartment, her battered remains were found.
Forensic experts said her skull had been smashed six times.

Polish company investigated for possible disclosure violation

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ One of Poland's best-known companies is
under investigation for allegedly breaking stock exchange
disclosure rules, a regulatory commission spokeswoman said Tuesday.
	   Elektrim SA, an electrical engineering company that was one of
the first members of the Warsaw Stock Exchange in 1992, last week
revealed it agreed in 1996 to sell a stake in its cellular
telephone holding for a nominal price by the middle of 1999.
	   ``It's unacceptable'' that Elektrim waited so long to disclose
the agreement, said Beata Stelmach, spokeswoman for the Security
and Exchange Commission.
	   Analysts said Elektrim's announcement of the deal effectively
knocked off at least dlrs 120 million _ the lowest estimate for the
true value of the stake being sold _ from the company's market
value of dlrs 800 million.
	   It also sent shock waves through Poland's financial community
because of Elektrim's status as a solid Polish company and pillar
of the stock exchange
	   ``Elektrim was considered trustworthy,'' said Piotr Kazimierski,
an analyst at the brokerage firm CAIB Securities. ``It was a
favorite of foreign investors.''
	   The announcement rocked the Warsaw exchange, with the all-share
Warsaw Stock Index falling to 11,532.0 points Tuesday from 12,453.2
points before the disclosure last Thursday. Elektrim's stock value
has plunged to 28.6 zloty (dlrs 8.2) a share from the Thursday
price of 39 zloty (dlrs 11.2).
	   Stelmach said an SEC investigation of the Elektrim agreement
began Friday. If the SEC rules Elektrim violated disclosure
regulations, the case ``will qualify for consideration by the
prosecutor's office,'' she said.
	   Penalties include a fine of up to 5 million zloty (dlrs 1.44
million) and imprisonment of up to five years.
	   According to an Elektrim statement, it agreed in 1996 to sell
6.5 percent of the cellular telephone company Polska Telefonia
Cyfrowa to Kulczyk Holding for ``a little more'' than the nominal
price.
	   At the time, Polska Telefonia Cyfrowa was just being set up, and
the nominal price of the 6.5 percent stake was 33 million zloty
(dlrs 12.8 million at the time), according to Kazimierski, the
analyst.
	   Since then, the value of the cellphone company, one of the first
in Poland, has soared. Now, the 6.5 percent stake is believed to be
worth anywhere from dlrs 120 million to dlrs 200 million.
	   Kazimierski said 6.5 percent of PTC shares accounts for 18-20
percent of Elektrim's value. Elektrim owns a 34.1 percent stake in
PTC, which equals about 85 percent of Elektrim's value, he said.
	   Elektrim said it failed to realize how much the value of PTC
shares would grow and how important its cellular telephone stake
would be. It also said it had been trying to renegotiate the
agreement's conditions with Kulczyk.

Protesters try to disrupt bidding process at Jerusalem site

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Contractors bidding on a Jewish housing project
in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem visited the site Tuesday, and
police detained three protesters from the Peace Now group trying to
disrupt the tour.
	   Peace Now leader Mossi Raz struggled and yelled as police
carried him into a police van. Police and soldiers also scuffled
with several other Peace Now activists as they tried to approach
the construction site.
	   The Jewish neighborhood of Har Homa, consisting of 6,500
apartments, is being built in east Jerusalem, on land Israel
captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   The Palestinians hope to establish a future capital in east
Jerusalem. They say Har Homa is part of an Israeli plan to cut off
the Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem from their hinterland in
Bethlehem and the southern West Bank.
	   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart has called the project
``inconsistent with the spirit'' of last month's Wye River peace
agreement.
	   On Tuesday, several Israeli builders interested in being awarded
contracts at Har Homa toured the site in a convoy of cars.
	   Fifteen Peace Now activists protesting against the construction
plans were barred by police from entering the site.
	   Five members of the outlawed anti-Arab Kach group demonstrated
next to Peace Now, chanting, ``Peace Now, a knife in the back.''
	   Israel maintains that Jerusalem must remain under exclusive
Israeli sovereignty. Prime Minister Netanyahu has promised that the
first homes in Har Homa would be completed in 2000.
	   Ground-breaking for Har Homa, known in Arabic as Jabal Abu
Ghneim, led to Palestinian rioting last year and a 19-month
stalemate in the peace negotiations.

German president kicks off state visit with Dresden orb and cross
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ German President Roman Herzog kicked off a
four-day state visit at Windsor Castle Tuesday by viewing a giant
handmade gilded orb and cross created by British craftsmen for the
people of Dresden as a symbol of friendship and reconciliation over
World War II.
	   The 18-foot (5.5- meter) orb and cross is a replica of the
ornament that once graced the skyline of Dresden atop the Baroque
Frauenkirche. The original was destroyed when the church was
reduced to rubble in a two-day Anglo-American bomb raid on the city
during World War II.
	   The 1.5 ton copper and stainless steel creation was made by
hand, in the old-fashioned way, as requested by the people of
Dresden. It was commissioned by the Dresden Trust, a group of
people in Britain who raised around 300,000 pounds (dlrs 495,000)
from individuals, charities and companies across the country.
	   Herzog and his wife, Christiane, are the first to be entertained
by Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle since fire ripped through
it in 1992, destroying some of its historic sections.
	   The Herzogs were met at London's Heathrow Airport by the queen's
cousin, the Duke of Kent, and escorted to join the queen and her
husband, Prince Phillip, for a carriage procession through the
streets of Windsor and into the castle, as crowds lined the streets
to look on.
	   But before the procession reached the gates of the castle, a
cavalryman escorting the carriages was thrown from his horse when
it reared. The rider, who was wearing a heavy breastplate and armor
fell on a sanded road infront of the queen's carriage. He was taken
to a local hospital with shoulder and spine injuries.
	   ``The incident did not delay the procession but did cause a
short delay to the military band entering the castle,'' said a
spokeswoman for Thames Valley Police, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   The Herzogs were scheduled to visit a German school and have tea
with the Queen Mother Elizabeth before attending a state banquet at
the castle, where they are staying.
	   Other stops scheduled for later in the tour include Edinburgh
Castle and the queen's Holyroodhouse palace in Scotland, as well as
museums, art galleries, churches and hospitals.
	   Herzog will meet with Prime Minister Tony Blair and other
political leaders and lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown
Warrior at Westminster Abbey.
	   The Herzogs were also expected to attend the premiere of a
German film in London on their final night and Mrs. Herzog was to
visit Burberry's, the clothing store.
	   The last state visit by a German president was in July 1986 by
President Richard von Weizsacker. The queen last paid a state visit
to Germany in 1992.

Publisher unveils most popular new phrases in the Japanese language
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The juries are in, the votes have been cast and a
Tokyo publisher has announced the 10 most popular new phrases to
enter the Japanese language this year.
	   The Jiyu Kokuminsha Inc. unveiled the winners, chosen every year
by a long selection process involving juries made up of readers, at
an awards ceremony Tuesday night showcasing Japan's love of
neologisms.
	   This year's top choice: ``the wizard of Yokohama,'' the nickname
for ace relief pitcher Kazuhiro Sasaki of the Yokohama Bay Stars
professional baseball team.
	   ``I was embarrassed to be called wizard, but from now on I'll
hold my head up high,'' Sasaki told those in attendance at the
ceremony.
	   The No. 2 spot went to ``the nobody, the soldier and the
weirdo,'' a phrase that captured public disgust for the three
candidates for prime minister who vied for the top spot in a ruling
party election last July.
	   The nobody referred to the eventual victor, Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi, an uninspiring public speaker who started his Cabinet with
one of the lowest approval ratings in Japanese history _ only to
see it decline ever since.
	   Liberal Democratic lawmaker Seiroku Kajiyama earned the moniker
the soldier for sitting at attention through television debates and
spouting conservative opinions, a spokeswoman for the event said.
	   The weirdo _ Junichiro Koizumi _ attracted attention more for
his outlandish, unkempt hair than any compelling vision for his
country's future.
	   Rounding out the top three was ``I told ya so!'' _ a phrase made
popular among school girls by the Pirates, a female pop duo.
	   The phrases were chosen by 5,000 juries made up of readers of
Jiyu Kokuminsha's most popular book, Elementary Knowledge of Modern
Language, a dictionary published yearly of new words and phrases.
	   A committee compiled the winners from the juries' votes.

Alleged godfather had interests across the world
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NAOMI KOPPEL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The man accused of heading a Russian mafia
organization had so much influence that he could get a hostage
released in Chechnya ``with a few telephone calls,'' a Swiss court
heard Tuesday.
	   A Swiss police inspector testified that when arrested two years
ago at Geneva airport, Sergei Mikhailov, was carrying two passports
from Russia, one from Israel and a diplomatic passport from Costa
Rica.
	   Officers later found false papers from Greece and Portugal and a
passport from Guyana, believed to have been bought for thousands of
dollars. He also lived in Austria and Belgium during the 1990s and
had been banned from entering both France and the Czech Republic.
	   said Police Inspector Patrick Scheurer.
	   Mikhailov, whose trial opened Monday, is accused of being a
member of a criminal organization. Prosecutors say he is the head
of the Solntsevskaya mafia in Moscow, which has 1,700 members and
the power to take over entire institutions in the city.
	   Mikhailov denies the charge, as well as one relating to the
purchase of his villa which allegedly broke the Swiss laws on
foreigners buying property.
	   The trial has seen unprecedented security measures, with the
court ringed by police, sheets at the windows to stop people seeing
in and bullet-proof vests for Mikhailov and some of the witnesses.
	   Two American witnesses are coming under FBI protection, while a
chief Russian witness has been given asylum in Switzerland after
receiving threats to his life.
	   In an attempt to prove that they were not being deliberately
obstructive, police inside the courthouse handed out coffee and
chocolate biscuits next to the search equipment, under a sign
explaining ``security and conviviality.''
	   After two failed attempts by the defense to stop the trial
Monday, Scheurer took the stand as the first prosecution witness.
	   He said witnesses would tell how Mikhailov had arranged for the
release of the brother of a business partner who was being held by
a gang in the Russian break-away republic of Chechnya.
	   ``With a few phone calls he managed to rescue the brother,''
said Scheurer, adding this showed how much influence Mikhailov had
with other criminal gangs.
	   Scheurer said in Mikhailov's lavish villa near Geneva, police
found illegal listening equipment, cash totaling 47,000 Swiss
francs (dlrs 33,500) and photographs of Mikhailov with other known
criminals.
	   One showed him standing with the son of Vyacheslav Ivankov, the
mafia godfather known as Yaponchik who is currently in prison in
the United States.
	   Scheurer also described how police had become suspicious about
how Mikhailov was conducting his affairs from inside his prison
cell.
	   ``He never wanted to telephone, he didn't write, he received no
visits except from his lawyers,'' he said.
	   One of Mikhailov's lawyers was later arrested as he left the
prison and was found to be carrying letters which had not been
passed by the censor.
	   The trial is expected to last at least a fortnight. Mikhailov,
who has been in custody for more than two years, faces a maximum of
seven-and-a-half years in prison.

Israeli defense minister: Greece turned down maneuver offer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS background graf on Cyprus &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said
Tuesday that Greece turned down his invitation to carry out a joint
operation in the Mediterranean after Israel and Turkey held similar
exercises in the area.
	   ``We invited them to a humanitarian exercise at sea more than a
year ago and they refused,'' Mordechai said, according to his
spokesman, Avi Benayahu.
	   ``They were invited once again to hold such an exercise'' during
the visit on Tuesday of the Greek air force commander, Lt. Gen.
Giorgos Antonetzis, to Israel, Benayahu said. Benayahu did not say
how the Greek visitor responded.
	   Turkey is Greece's traditional rival, and Greece has been
watching the growing Israeli-Turkish military alliance with some
concern.
	   Turkey and Greece remain at odds over Cyprus.
	   Cyprus has been divided since Turkish forces invaded its
northern third to protect the Turkish minority following a
short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece in 1974.
	   Mordechai said he supported a diplomatic solution to the Cyprus
conflict.
	   The Greek air force commander was to stay in Israel until
Thursday night as a guest of the Israeli air force. He was to meet
military officials and tour defense industry facilities, the
Israeli army spokesman's office said.
	   The Greek air force already has several defense contracts with
Israel, including the maintenance of F-16 fighter planes.
	   Mordechai will visit Greece at the end of December as a guest of
the Greek Jewish community. He will hold military and policy
meetings in Athens and in the northern port city of Salonica.

<TEXT>
	   POTSDAM, Germany (AP) _ Germany and France agreed Tuesday that
fighting unemployment should be Europe's top priority, throwing
their weight behind a shift toward a left-leaning agenda among
European governments.
	   French and German leaders also called for tighter international
scrutiny of the financial world, including highly speculative
``hedge funds,'' seen as a way to counter damaging swings in the
markets.
	   In a joint declaration at the end of a two-day German-French
summit in Potsdam, outside of Berlin, the leaders said a jobs
creation pact is needed to offset years of government austerity
measures to get Europe ready for the single currency, the euro,
being launched Jan. 1.
	   ``We want to make a great common effort to move the theme of
employment to the center of European politics,'' German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder told a news conference with French President
Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
	   Member governments of the European Union should set ``binding,
verifiable'' goals for putting their citizens back to work, the
leaders said in a declaration.
	   Unemployment in the 11 countries launching the euro is a
stubborn 10.9 percent, and putting people back to work has been a
central political theme among European leaders.
	   The declaration emphasized the importance of the French-German
relationship, but there was discord, too.
	   Both sides set officials to work to assess the possible effects
of the new German government's pledge to wean the country off
nuclear power. France has no such plans and does lucrative business
reprocessing nuclear fuel from German power plants.
	   Chirac also refused comment on a recent call by German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer for NATO to abandon its doctrine allowing
it to launch a nuclear attack with out being targeted first. The
proposal has irritated the United States.
	   Both sides agreed to push plans to merge European aerospace
industries to take on U.S. giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin,
though they didn't resolve the issue of French participation.
	   Schroeder told Chirac during the summit that he supports
bringing together the British and German industries first if France
doesn't join in from the start. He stressed, though, that the door
would be left open to the French.
	   The big European aircraft makers _ Daimler-Benz Aerospace,
British Aerospace and Aerospatiale _ agreed in principle in March
to seek a merger. Daimler-Benz Aerospace and British Aerospace are
in advanced talks on a two-way alliance because of obstacles to
Aerospatiale's early participation, including slow progress toward
privatization.
	   With the euro binding 11 European economies closer together than
ever before, the leaders also pledged to seek common European
policies on taxes and workers' rights.
	   Germany and France hold summits twice yearly, but this meeting
has special significance because of the euro's debut and Germany's
six-month EU presidency starting Jan. 1.
	   Schroeder sought French support for German demands to lower its
contribution to the EU budget, gaining Chirac's acknowledgement
that ``there is a problem.''
	   Germany, which contributes one-third of the EU budget, annually
pays 22 billion marks (dlrs 12 billion) more than it receives in
funds.

Coffee prices rise at Nairobi auction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI (Dow Jones) _ Good demand for quality coffee pushed up
prices at the Nairobi Coffee auction Tuesday.
	   ``The auction was firm with good demand all round,'' said Peter
Kinyua of African Coffee Co. ``The quality offered was good for
this time of the year _ a clear indication of good qualities to
come,'' he said.
	   Kinyua said whenever ``main crop'' or good quality lots of
coffee from the current season come up there is strong demand, an
indication that prices could be firm in the months ahead.
	   Kinyua said increased supply of main crop coffee that will be in
higher demand is expected to push prices higher in early 1999.
	   The last auction of the year will be held next Tuesday. The
first of the new year will be held Jan. 5, 1999.
	   Kinyua said a total of 16,299 50-kgs bags were offered.
	   Following were highs and lows in dollars per 50-kg bag quoted by

Medical tests point to doping at Festina
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with quotes from Virenque and his lawyer; questions
over Virenque's future, Herve's level, CLARIFIES attribution &QL; 
 &UR; By SEBASTIEN BOUWY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ Medical tests suggest that cyclists on the
Festina team, expelled from the Tour de France this summer, took
banned drugs, judicial sources said Tuesday citing a judge's
report.
	   But top Festina cyclist Richard Virenque said the figures
vindicate his claim that he didn't take banned substances.
	   Judge Patrick Keil called Virenque and teammates Pascal Herve
and Laurent Brochard to Lille to give them the results of tests
carried out in July.
	   According to judicial sources who saw the report, the results
showed Virenque had a hematocrit level of 49.3 percent. The
hematocrit level measures the proportion of red blood cells in a
blood sample _ one sign of doping, since the substances increase
red blood cells.
	   But Virenque's level is just within the limit of 50 percent set
by the International Cycling Union, the sport's governing body.
	   Herve had a level of 52.6.
	   Medical experts have been analyzing blood, urine and hair tests
since Festina team manager Bruno Roussel admitted during the race
to the use of the banned substance erythropoietin (EPO) among
cyclists.
	   Virenque and Herve both deny they knowingly took any banned
substances.
	   ``The biological parameters demonstrate scientifically that I
didn't take (doping agents),'' Virenque said as he left the
hearing. ``Today I am relieved and I hope soon hope to get back on
a bike. It is the end of a nightmare.''
	   Gilbert Collard, Virenque's lawyer, said that ``no traces of
anabolics, growth hormones, amphetamines or masking products were
brought to attention concerning Richard Virenque.''
	   However, testing remains an inexact science and the results
announced by Keil suggest that eight of Festina's nine cyclists
took banned substances.
	   Virenque's future remains uncertain.
	   Festina has cut by half its budget for next season, is
renegotiating contracts with all its riders and has already said
the Frenchman will probably not be a member of the team next year.
	   Three of the Spanish team's Swiss cyclists _ Alex Zuelle,
Laurent Dufaux and Armin Meier _ have been banned from all
competition until May 1 after they admitted taking EPO.

Black liberation leaders armed South African vigilantes while
</HEADLINE>
talking peace
 &UR; EDS: AMs; RECASTS and edits to conform throughout; NO pick up
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Black liberation leaders operated a
secret military command to supply vigilantes with weapons while
they negotiated an end to white minority rule with the former
apartheid government, a Cabinet minister testified Tuesday.
	   Public Works Minister Jeff Radebe, 45, the first Cabinet member
to apply for amnesty from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission,
described how he organized and armed African National Congress
self-defense units.
	   The units operated in KwaZulu-Natal Province from 1990 to 1994,
as South Africa was emerging from decades of apartheid and
undergoing a painful period of black-on-black violence.
	   More than 5,000 people died in clashes between the units and
militants of the rival Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party. The
Zulu militants were backed by the apartheid government, according
to a recent Truth Commission report.
	   Radebe acknowledged that in the absence of a strict command
structure, many self-defense members turned to crime, and continue
to contribute to South Africa's spiralling murder and robbery
rates.
	   ``It cannot be denied that some of the comrades gravitated
toward crime,'' Radebe said in an interview.
	   The hearing offered detailed insight into the ANC's role in the
upheavals that preceded the first all-race elections in 1994, when
Nelson Mandela became president. The ANC at the time was
negotiating an end to white rule.
	   Radebe was ANC chairman for Kwazulu-Natal region and also served
as an underground commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the
Nation), the ANC's armed wing.
	   ``This place was in flames. Almost every Saturday I used to bury
comrades,'' Radebe told the panel.
	   Orders to set up the structures came from Umkhonto commanders,
who included the head of the Communist Party, the now-deceased
Chris Hani, and Ronnie Kasrils, now Deputy Defense Minister, Radebe
said.
	   After being trained and armed, the ANC units reverted to control
by local communities.
	   The reason for avoiding a direct command structure was to keep
Umkhonto's activities secret from the white minority government, he
said.
	   Radebe said he did not welcome the role of setting up the units,
but felt violence would have taken a ``heavier toll'' without them.
	   ``If you talk peace without the capacity to defend yourself, it
would be a hollow peace,'' Radebe said in an interview. ``As the
ANC, we were involved in a multi-pronged strategy in solving
problems.''
	   As the elections approached in 1994, Radebe said he was ordered
to disarm the self-defense units and integrate them into military
and police structures.
	   But Radebe and two other applicants for amnesty on Tuesday could
not answer repeated questions from the commission about how many
arms were supplied to the units and how many were retrieved.
	   In an interview, Radebe said most of the cadres have joined the
army and police forces, but could not give any numbers.
	   Radebe said he is seeking amnesty because he and his party
regret excesses that occurred.
	   ``I think as we are building a new democracy in South Africa,
our people ... need to know the truth, and to open the old wounds
of the terrible time from 1990 to 1994.''

European Central Bank gathers as pressure grows for clearer stance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ With economic growth faltering, the
core council of Europe's future central bank meets Tuesday under
increasing pressure to spell out its policies before launching the
euro currency on Jan. 1.
	   The European Central Bank begins setting monetary policy,
including interest rates, for the 11 euro nations as soon as the
currency is launched.
	   Analysts say the bank has a tough job ahead, with Europe's
economy weakened by lower demand in Asia for a range of goods and
services and by Russia's financial crisis. Manufacturing orders are
down. If prices begin to sink as growth falls, then recession is
possible, some analysts believe.
	   ``It's a much more difficult situation than we all thought some
time ago. Inflation is certainly no problem. Right now everybody is
very much afraid of deflation,'' said Adolf Rosenstock, economist
at Nomura.
	   Europe's new interest rate will be a key issue in the
closed-door talks. The rate is likely to be at or near Germany's
3.3 percent, though there is speculation it could drop to 3
percent.
	   Although the bank is independent, it has come under steady
political pressure from Germany to keep interest rates low to boost
economies and help governments cut unemployment, standing
Europe-wide at 9.9 percent.
	   The bank says its job is to keep inflation low and prices
steady, not to tinker with monetary policy to achieve broader
economic goals. But pressure only grew Tuesday as leaders of
Germany and France agreed to strengthen efforts to fight
unemployment and boost the economy.
	   Another major issue is how the central bank will assess money
supply, a key element in deciding future interest rate policy.
	   The governing council of the European Central Bank consists of
11 central bank chiefs from the European Union countries launching
the euro, plus a Frankfurt-based directorate of six that includes
bank President Wim Duisenberg.

Ford exec sees more mergers ahead in global auto industry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A wave of consolidation will continue to sweep the
global auto industry, leading to mergers between rival U.S. and
Japanese carmakers, a top executive of Ford Motor Co. said Tuesday.
	   The most likely prospects for tie-ups or takeovers are Japan's
smaller automakers, who lack the money and know-how to compete in
world markets, Ford Motor vice-chairman Wayne Booker said at a
luncheon speech in Tokyo.
	   ``Even though (small Japanese automakers) are tied with very
rich companies in some cases, I don't believe they will be able to
sustain the financial and human resources needed to meet the 21st
century'' challenges, he said.
	   ``Time will come when it will become a matter of necessity'' for
automakers on both sides of the Pacific to forge alliances, he
said.
	   While in the past Japanese companies have shunned foreign
suitors, Booker said mergers limited to domestic auto companies
would fail to provide the global reach needed to survive.
	   As a result, cross-border mergers between Japan, U.S. and
European carmakers will become more commonplace.
	   But Booker added that his company has no plans to ``accomplish
any major mergers in the Asia-Pacific.''
	   Ford already has a 33 percent stake in Hiroshima-based Mazda
Motor Corp. and has taken effective control of the company by
installing one of its own executives as president.
	   Booker conceded that the performance of Ford-brand cars in the
Japanese market has been less than spectacular, despite heavy
investment including a chain of dealerships.
	   ``We are not challenging Toyota,'' he said. ``Toyota has 40
percent of the market; if we have a few percentage points, that is
enough.''
	   Booker said Ford is focusing more on China, Thailand and India
and has set a target of 10 percent of Asian market share by 2007,
from its present 1 percent.

	   ROME (AP) _ The head of a police anti-terrorist squad was
arrested Tuesday on charges of corruption and Mafia association, a
week after Milan's police chief was put behind bars for allegedly
killing a smuggler, authorities said.
	   Gennaro D'Amico, 53, who heads the anti-terrorist unit in
Campobasso, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) northeast of Naples,
allegedly provided protection to a local crime syndicate for a 1.5
million lire (dlrs 950) monthly payoff from 1992 to 1994. At the
time, D'Amico was police chief of San Giorgio, a small town near
Naples.
	   Italian news reports said testimony by a Mafia turncoat led
authorities to D'Amico.
	   Prosecutors have issued arrest warrants for 24 other people,
including businessmen and mobsters, allegedly involved in the case.
	   Milan's police chief, Francesco Forleo, was arrested Nov. 23 on
murder charges in the shooting of a smuggler during a police chase
in 1995. Forleo was police chief of Brindisi, a southern port city,
at the time of shooting.

ITF says it expects to `fully support' IOC doping policy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Tennis, one of three Olympic sports which
dissented from an international agreement to unify anti-drug
policies, says it expects to fall into line before February's world
summit on doping.
	   The International Tennis Federation joined the governing bodies
of soccer (FIFA) and cycling (UCI) in expressing reservations to a
package of anti-doping measures adopted Friday at a meeting of 35
Olympic sports federations.
	   The ITF said Tuesday that its leaders still need to consult with
the men's (ATP) and women's (WTA) tours on the Olympic initiatives.
	   ``There is no other sport in the world that has the cohesive
anti-doping program that tennis has,'' ITF president Brian Tobin
said. ``By the IOC conference in February we will have had the
opportunity to discuss these issues with our partners and expect to
be in a position to fully support the unified approach that the IOC
has presented.''
	   During Friday's meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, federations
endorsed a minimum two-year suspension for athletes found guilty of
using steroids or other serious banned drugs. The penalty for a
second offense would be a life ban.
	   Under the terms of the agreement, federations which don't fully
comply with the measures risk being dropped from the Olympics.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch has expressed confidence
that tennis, soccer and cycling will endorse the package before the
Feb. 2-4 world anti-doping summit in Lausanne.
	   Tobin met with Samaranch at the ATP Tour World Championship
finals in Hanover, Germany, last weekend.
	   The ITF said they discussed raising the profile of tennis at the
Olympics, ensuring that the world's top players take part, and the
possibility of having Olympic results count toward computer
rankings on the men's tour.
	   ``The Olympic tennis event is a priority for the ITF and its aim
is to continue to raise the profile of the event in association
with the ATP Tour and WTA Tour,'' the statement said.
	   Tennis was reinstated as a full Olympic sport at the 1988 Seoul
Olympics after last appearing as a medal event in 1924. Some of the
sport's top millionaire professionals have skipped the Olympics,
preferring to concentrate on the Grand Slams and tour events.
	   In a separate development, the ITF said it was making
significant progress in reunifying the separate bodies which govern
the sport.
	   The ITF said it was working closely with the ATP Tour on joint
marketing and promotional programs, and collaborating on calendar
issues to avoid scheduling conflicts involving tour events, Grand
Slams, Davis Cup and Olympics.

 &UR; Real Madrid beats Vasco Da Gama 2-1
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES thruout with comments, details. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Spanish striker Raul Gonzalez scored with eight
minutes remaining and gave Real Madrid a 2-1 victory over Brazil's
Vasco da Gama on Tuesday night for its first Toyota Cup title since
1960.
	   Gonzalez settled Clarence Seedorf's pass before scoring, giving
Real the crown for the first time since it won the inaugural trophy
38 years ago.
	   It was the fourth straight victory and 17th overall for Europe
in the annual battle against South America for what is considered
the world club championship. South America's Copa Libertadores
champions still hold the edge, having won 20 of the 37 titles.
	   ``We are very pleased to win the title,'' Real manager Guus
Hiddink said. ``We thought we could play well in general.''
	   Playing before more than 51,000 spectators at Tokyo's National
Stadium, Vasco da Gama's Nasa gave Real Madrid the lead in the 25th
minute, trying to head away Roberto Carlos' cross at the penalty
spot but instead putting it in his own net.
	   It took 19 minutes before Vasco could equalize when Juninho
scored after Real Madrid goalkeeper Bodo Illgner fumbled the a shot
by Ramon.
	   Vasco, making its first appearance in the Toyota Cup in
centennial year, threatened repeatedly but were thwarted by
Illgner.
	   Raul broke the deadlock but controlling a long pass from Seedorf
in the penalty area, eluding two defenders in front of the net and
beating Vasco keeper Germany.
	   ``We had a several chances in the second half, but we couldn't
make it while the other (Real Madrid) made a few chance for the
goal,'' Vasco manager Antonio Lopez said.
	   Gonzalez, who scored a dramatic goal on a left-footed volley in
a 3-2 World Cup loss to Nigeria in Spain's opener at France, was
named the game's most valuable player for Tuesday's effot, receive
an Altezza car from title sponsor Toyota.
	   ``Everybody wants to score a goal in a final,'' said the
21-year-old Raul, now in his fourth season with Real. ``Today we
played more like a team, and that's why we won.''

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ France's oil giant Total SA will take
over Belgium's Petrofina SA, merging the two into one of the
world's largest oil companies, the companies announced Tuesday.
	   The merger announcement comes on the same day that Exxon and
Mobil agreed to a record dlrs 77.2 billion merger, creating the
world's largest oil company.
	   ``The move is part of a global change, oil prices have
practically been cut in half over the past year. All companies are
seeking to survive in this new situation,'' said Total Chairman
Thierry Desmarest. ``The business environment will be tougher than
in past years.''
	   The new company, known as Total Fina, would be the third-largest
oil company in Europe and will seek to be listed on the Paris,
Brussels, New York and London stock exchanges, a joint statement
said.
	   Employment totals would remain largely unchanged, with 69,100
people working for the new group, officials from the two companies
said.
	   ``The combination of Total and Petrofina will allow the new
entity to capture substantial productivity gains, particularly in
the North Sea, and to expand its positions in the deep offshore
(United States, Angola),'' a joint statement said.
	   The deal to create Total Fina is based on a stock swap that
gives Total control of 41 percent of Petrofina, Belgium's largest
industrial company. The remainder of Petrofina's shares will be bid
on at a later date, company officials said.
	   Investors on the Paris stock exchange reacted skeptically to the
new merger. Total shares took a big hit, falling almost 10 percent
in early trading Tuesday.
	   Before the deal was announced, the two companies had stock worth
1,391 billion Belgian francs (dlrs 39.9 billion).
	   Petrofina stock has been gaining ground in recent days on rumors
that the company was in talks with France's Elf Aquitaine SA, Total
SA and Italy's ENI SpA.
	   Petrofina's stock stood at 14,250 francs (dlrs 407.9) Friday
before trading was suspended Monday. The deal valued the stock at
19.482 francs (dlrs 557.7) _ an increase of more than one-third.
	   ``We have to recognize that the value today is higher than what
we could get as a stand-alone company in the medium term,'' said
Francois Cornelis, head of Petrofina.
	   A combined general meeting of shareholders has been called for
Jan. 14 to approve the agreement.
	   Petrofina, which employs 14,700 people worldwide, is one of
Belgium's biggest industrial companies, with refining and
distribution operations in Europe and the United States.
	   Total SA employs 54,400 and is France's No. 2 oil company, but
has aggressively expanded crude oil and gas businesses.

Media center opening postponed as Asian Games embarrassments mount

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Inauguration of the main media center
in Thailand for the 13th Asian Games was postponed Tuesday because
the facilities weren't ready, while a special team was assigned to
round-the-clock duty to keep insects out of the games' main
swimming pool.
	   Five days before Asia's biggest sporting competition officially
opens, bugs are turning up _ literally _ in the last-minute frenzy
to put the finishing touches on venues and, in some cases, make
them usable.
	   The Bangkok Post highlighted problems both about the poor soccer
pitch at the National Stadium where the main matches will be played
and the central swimming pool's tendency to fill up with dead
insects.
	   Taiwan's riding team at the equestrian center meanwhile blamed
poor arena conditions for injuries to a prize horse.
	   Organizers could only be thankful that morning rains did not
extend into the afternoon's rehearsal of the opening ceremony.
	   Nearly 5,000 journalists are accredited to cover the games,
which will bring together some 6,000 athletes from 41 countries in
what the organizers have billed as the 20th century's last great
sporting event.
	   But the organization and construction of the venues has been
plagued by the Asian economic crisis.
	   The main media center, already a week behind schedule for its
inauguration, saw the official opening postponed again Tuesday when
Jurin Laksanavisit, a government minister, didn't show because the
facilities weren't ready.
	   The pitch at the Bangkok's National Stadium, where Oman
demolished Hong Kong 6-0 in Monday's preliminary soccer matches to
unofficially kick off the competition, is far below the required
international standard, the Bangkok Post cited Asia's top soccer
official as saying.
	   Dato Peter Velappan, secretary general of the Asian Football
Confederation, said that the pitch needed to be upgraded
immediately or another ground would have to be found for remaining
matches.
	   Velappan said he had warned Thailand six months ago that the
pitch was not good enough. Attempts to improve it made matters
worse because the contractor who laid new turf had more experience
with home gardens than soccer grounds, the Post said.
	   Just days ago, parts of the pitch were covered in water and bare
patches were showing.
	   Meanwhile, the head of the Swimming Association of Thailand was
quoted in the same newspaper as saying that thousands of dead
insects of all kinds have been found floating in the central
competition pool.
	   ``For Thai men, it might not be a serious problem but I am sure
it would make the foreigners' hair stand on end,'' Maj. Gen. Kamol
Saen-issara said.
	   Kamol said organizers might have to turn to strong insecticides,
but vowed not to use any substances that could harm swimmers. He
added that he hoped that when the pool is in use, the increased
presence of humans might keep the bugs away.
	   The swimming association announced Tuesday that it will send a
24-hour standby bug-hunting team to help attendants clear insects
from the pool.
	   The association's equipment coordinator, Chiraphan Chanmanee,
also said the games' health subcommittee had assigned a pest
control unit to exterminate insects in and around the pool every
two days.

UAE company to run mobile phone service in Qatar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ A United Arab Emirates
company has signed an agreement to operate mobile telephones in
Qatar, a company statement said Tuesday.
	   Under the agreement signed Monday, Qatar Telecom, or Q-Tel, has
been given the right to distribute and market U.A.E's Thuraya
Satellite Telecommunications Co.'s services.
	   Thuraya chairman Mohammad Hassan Omran said the agreement makes
Q-Tel Thuraya's second regional service provider after U.A.E.'s
monopoly telecoms company, Emirates Telecommunications Corp., or
Etisalat, Thuraya's largest shareholder.
	   Financial details of the deal were not disclosed. It was also
not know how Q-Tel, the Qatari telecoms monopoly, will benefit from
the deal.
	   Q-Tel is also a Thuraya shareholder. It already has a mobile
phone service in Qatar but does not offer high-tech features of
Thuraya such as voice mail and data capability.
	   Thuraya plans to launch a geosynchronous satellite in May 2000
in a project valued at dlrs 1 billion. Hughes Space and
Communications Co., a division of General Motors Corp.'s Hughes
Electronic Corp. unit, is the contractor. Switzerland's Ascom Corp.
is the technology partner.
	   The company also plans to launch a second satellite at a later
stage to make 13,750 satellite channels available to 1.8 million
users.
	   Thuraya's satellites are planned to cover most of Asia, Africa
and parts of Europe and provide voice, fax and data services via
hand-held, vehicle-based and fixed terminals.

Poland: Israel failed to submit missiles for tests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Signaling further problems with an arms
contract with Israeli companies, a defense ministry spokesman said
Tuesday that Israel failed to arrange tests of its NTD missiles in
November as requested.
	   Poland wanted the tests held in November so that its experts
could watch the missiles intended to arm Polish-made Huzar
helicopters perform in local terrain and weather conditions.
	   ``We have been ready all along, but the Israeli side did not
name a date,'' said Capt. Andrzej Adamczyk, spokesman for deputy
Defense Minister Romuald Szeremietiew. Adamczyk said there was no
date set for the tests.
	   Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek's government planned to discuss the
issue at a Cabinet-meeting Tuesday but decided to wait a week, when
Buzek and Industry Minister Jerzy Steinhof return from a visit to
Mexico.
	   Following years of negotiating with several potential partners,
Poland last year awarded the dlrs 800 million contract to Israel's
Rafael and Elbit Systems Ltd. to equip the Huzar helicopters in
line with NATO requirements.
	   Poland, which plans to join NATO in April, selected the Israeli
companies over the U.S. company Boeing.
	   Under the deal, which required approval from both governments,
Rafael would supply the Huzar with anti-tank NTD missiles and Elbit
would provide electronic integrating systems.
	   But Poland's Solidarity-led government, which took office
shortly after the agreement was signed, criticized the handling of
the tenders by its ex-communist predecessors and demanded missile
tests. It also decided to seek another tender for the integrating
systems, but has set no date for it.

Swiss conclude vital transport deal with European Union
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comment, more detail, byline &QL; 
 &UR; By BALZ BRUPPACHER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Four years of tough negotiations were
concluded early Tuesday with a transport deal between the European
Union and Switzerland, clearing the way to a wider agreement
covering areas like air transport and labor.
	   The accord obliges the Swiss _ who long held out for
environmental reasons _ to raise the weight limit on trucks to 40
tons from 28 tons by the year 2005.
	   In return, they will levy a tax of at least 325 Swiss francs
(dlrs 230) on trucks transiting through the Alpine nation. This
will be used to help fund two massive mountain rail tunnels,
intended to take the pressure off the roads.
	   The Swiss will be allowed to keep a controversial night-time ban
but have pledged to speed up clearance for early morning traffic.
	   EU spokeswoman Sarah Lambert described the accord as a ``major
step forward.''
	   The notion of trucks paying taxes ``introduces for the first
time in EU transport law the concept that ... the polluter pays,''
she told reporters in Brussels.
	   Wealthy Switzerland is not a member of the 15-nation EU, but is
surrounded by members Germany, France, Italy and Austria. Its tight
restrictions on foreign trucks have for years infuriated
neighboring countries because of the inconvenience of compliance.
	   Lambert said the accord meant that European trucks would be able
to avoid detours through Austria totalling 500,000 kilometers per
year, thereby cutting transport costs between the North and South
of Europe by at least 50 million European currency units (dlrs 57.5
million).
	   After an all-night bargaining session with Swiss Transport
Minister Moritz Leuenberger, EU ministers overcame Italian
misgivings and gave their blessing to the transport agreement early
Tuesday.
	   Agreement by Swiss voters Sunday for a 30 billion Swiss franc
(dlrs 22 billion) finance package to help modernize the Swiss rail
network and connect it to the rest of Europe apparently helped the
case.
	   The Swiss government and business representatives reacted with
overwhelming relief. The agreement was initially thrashed out with
EU transport commissioner Neil Kinnock last January but then put on
hold because of objections by various EU countries.
	   Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti said he hoped that a wider
package of bilateral agreements could now be wrapped up. In
particular, Switzerland hopes that its concessions on trucks will
persuade the EU to give national flag carrier Swissair better
access to European airports.
	   This is due to be discussed at a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers
next Monday. However, with the EU preoccupied with its own plans
for monetary union and eastward expansion, the Swiss dossier is low
on the list of priorities.
	   In 1992, Swiss voters rejected plans to join a loose European
free trade agreement . This forced the government into painstaking
sectoral negotiations with Brussels to gain the access it needs to
crucial export markets.
	   The government has officially applied to join the EU but has not
pressed ahead with its request, fearing that the electorate might
once again say ``no.''

Ex-premier reassures investors that Russian economy will recover

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SCHEVENINGEN, Netherlands (AP) _ Former Russian premier Victor
Chernomyrdin sought to reassure international investors Tuesday
that Russia will survive its current economic ills.
	   Speaking at an international business conference in this North
Sea coastal town, Chernomyrdin said Russia's economic woes are
``far from desperate'' and that there is no exodus of foreign
companies.
	   ``I can't make the situation better, but I think in Russia we
have every possibility to overcome the crisis,'' he said.
``European companies are still with us. They are not leaving
Russia.''
	   ``We're very ill ... but I believe we will overcome our illness
and we're set to be healthy,'' he told participants of the two-day
Global Panel conference.
	   The former prime minister's rhetoric was a tough sell: Russia is
now mired in its worst economic crisis since the 1991 Soviet
collapse. Images of ailing President Boris Yeltsin have also raised
worries about his leadership and the country's future.
	   On Tuesday, International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus
planned to open two days of talks on Moscow's frozen loan agreement
with the IMF.
	   The country is seeking further installments of an IMF bailout
package that was reached in the summer but frozen after the Russian
government devalued the ruble and defaulted on some of its debts in
August.
	   Camdessus was not expected to announce any breakthroughs, but
his visit to Moscow would give Russia an opportunity to make its
case and lobby anew for fresh funds.
	   Chernomyrdin stressed that his government is taking measures to
contain the crisis, but urged officials to speed up recovery plans.
	   ``It would be a big mistake to believe that Russia would leave
the international financial network even for a short time,'' he
said.

Emirates allows entry to foreigners with Israeli visa stamps
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ The United Arab Emirates is
allowing entry to foreigners who have visited Israel, an
immigration official said Tuesday.
	   The Emirates began permitting foreigners with Israeli visa
stamps in their passports to enter the country about three months
ago following directives from the Interior Ministry, the official
said. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Most Arab countries, including the United Arab Emirates, do not
have diplomatic relations with Israel and for years did not allow
entry to anyone who had visited the Jewish state.
	   In recent years, Oman and Qatar established low-level trade
relations with Israel and began allowing Israelis _ as well as
foreigners with Israeli visa stamps _ to enter.
	   Kuwait allows British, American and French citizens to enter if
they have Israeli visas in their passports and evaluates others on
a case-by-case basis, an immigration official at the airport said.
	   The other Arab Gulf states _ Bahrain and Saudi Arabia _ ban
entry to anyone with an Israeli visa stamp.
	   Egypt and Jordan, which have peace treaties with Israel, and
some North African nations also allow Israeli visitors as well as
foreigners who have visited the Jewish state.

Arafat to visit Sweden, Norway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat this
weekend will travel to the capitals of Sweden and Norway, both
countries that have played roles in the Middle East peace process.
	   On Saturday, Arafat is to take part in a Middle East conference
in Stockholm, called to mark the 10th anniversary of Arafat's
statement in the Swedish capital that the Palestine Liberation
Organization recognized Israel's right to exist.
	   Representatives from Israel and the United States have also been
invited to Stockholm for the meeting, but there was no immediate
information on who would attend from those countries.
	   ''We are not counting on representatives coming from the United
States and Israel on such a high level as (Israeli prime minister
Benjamin) Netanyahu and Madeleine Albright,'' the U.S. Secretary of
State, Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh said Tuesday.
	   Whatever the representation, ''we can at least have a good and
profitable discussion,'' Lindh said.
	   On Sunday, Arafat is to make a stopover in Oslo, Norway, said
Norwegian foreign ministry spokesman Ingvard Havnen. Arafat was
invited by Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek.
	   Although the Oslo stopped is planned to last only a few hours,
any trip by Palestinian or Israeli officials to the Norwegian
capital has substantial symbolic weight because the Israel-PLO
peace accord was worked out in secret negotiations in Norway that
became known as the ''Oslo Channel.''
	   The peace process has been troubled and often stalled since
Netanyahu became prime minister.
	   The process appeared to be moving forward last week after the
implementation of the first stage of an agreement under which
Israel would withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank by the end
of January in exchange for Palestinian measures against Islamic
militants.
	   But new acrimony arose this week when Netanyahu said he would
walk away from the peace agreements if Arafat unilaterally declares
Palestinian statehood in May. The Palestinians contend the peace
agreements allow such a declaration after a five-year period of
autonomy.
	   The Palestinians also contend that Israel has breached an
agreement to release 750 prisoners. In the first stage of the
release, most of the 250 set free were criminals; the Palestinians
demand that Israel free political activists and those jailed for
anti-Israeli activities.

F.A. still considering financial misconduct charges against Forest;

move to Leeds &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Football Association said Tuesday it hoped to
resolve financial misconduct charges early next year against
Premier League club Nottingham Forest.
	   Charges against former manager Brian Clough were dropped three
months ago, but similar charges of unauthorized payments in
transfer deals made in the late 1980 and early '90s are still
hanging over other club officials.
	   Forest chief executive Phil Soar said Tuesday it was ``an
absolute disgrace'' the charges brought 11 months ago were
unresolved.
	   ``It is a complex case and we are at present awaiting legal
advice on an important piece of evidence,'' an FA spokesman said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LEICESTER, England (AP) _ Leicester manager Martin O'Neill still
hasn't signed a new contract and admits his days could be numbered.
	   In October, Leicester offered O'Neill a lucrative new contract
to stave off a bid from Leeds. At the time, Leicester officials
denied O'Neill permission to talk with Leeds.
	   O'Neill now says he is only being ``tolerated'' by the club
board, which he says has been interfering in on-the-pitch matters.
	   ``I want to run the football club the way I see fit,'' O'Neill
said Tuesday. ``I know more about football than the people on the
board, so I'll live and die by the results.''
	   Leicester is in 13th place, 11 points behind leaders Aston
Villa.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BLACKBURN, England (AP) _ Last-place Blackburn Rovers is rumored
to be looking at a long list of choices to replace Roy Hodgson, who
was fired as manager last month.
	   The list is reported to include ex-Liverpool coach Roy Evans,
Graeme Souness of Portugal's Benfica, and Manchester United
assistant Brian Kidd.
	   Manchester United has blocked Blackburn's attempt to talk with
Kidd.
	   Scottish international Colin Hendry was voted by Blackburn fans
as their choice to follow Hodgson. But Hendry says he's staying
with Glasgow Rangers, quashing rumors he could return as
player-manager.
	   ``My playing career carries on at Rangers,'' he said Tuesday.
``I'm happy here and that's the end of the story. As far as I'm
concerned, by future and my career are at Rangers.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEWCASTLE, England (AP) _ David Batty trained Tuesday with
Newcastle with a disagreement over his transfer fee holding up his
move to back to Leeds.
	   Batty last week asked Newcastle manager Ruud Gullit for a
transfer to Leeds _ his hometown. Leeds is reported to have offered
4 million pounds (dlrs 6.6 million) with Newcastle asking for 6
million pounds (dlrs 10 million).
	   ``Without revealing how much we think he is worth, I would say 4
million is nowhere near enough,'' said Newcastle chairman Freddy
Shepherd.
	   Batty still lives with his family in Leeds and says he'd like to
return to the club.

Italy starts expected trio against Sweden which may field
</HEADLINE>
Johansson &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Italy will start the same trio of players
who upset the United States when it takes on defending champion
Sweden in the Dec. 4-6 Davis Cup final at Assago Forum.
	   Italian captain Paolo Bertolucci announced Tuesday that Andrea
Gaudenzi and Davide Sanguinetti will play the singles with Diego
Nargiso teaming with Gaudenzi in the doubles.
	   Gianluca Pozzi will be the reserve player.
	   ``You can't change a winning team,'' said Bartolucci.
	   Italy's No.1 player Gaudenzi, Sanguinetti and Nargiso led a 4-1
rout of the United States in the Davis Cup semifinals at Milwaukee.
	   Meanwhile Thomas Johansson, who's nursing a strained right knee,
may become a last-minute starter on the Swedish side in the
three-day final on clay in an indoor sports palace at the Milan
outskirts.
	   Johansson, initially dropped from the Swedish team because of
the sore knee and his questionable efficiency on clay, trained at
the Forum this week showing good form and determination.
	   Johansson may replace Magnus Norman on Sweden's quartet.
	   Swedish captain Carl-Axel Hageskog said he will announce the
team on Thursday _ the day of the official draw in Milan _ and
declined to comment on Johansson's chances to play the final.
	   Johansson is the highest-ranked Swedish player in the ATP
computer lists, 17th.
	   Sweden enters the final as favorite to clinch its seventh title
- the third in four years.
	   However Hageskog noted Italy may take advantage from playing on
clay.
	   ``Otherwise, I'm not worried with the home crowd. My players are
able to negotiate every situation,'' he said.
	   The opening day singles on Friday begin at 1330gmt.

Russia's democratic coalition to be officially formed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A wide coalition of democratic leaders seeking to
prevent Communists from returning to power will soon be officially
inaugurated, a member of the group said Tuesday.
	   The founding conference of the umbrella group ``should take
place in the near future,'' said Oleg Sysuyev, the deputy head of
the Kremlin administration who called for forming the coalition.
	   A declaration signed last week ``calls for uniting democratic
forces, for combating extremism and fascism,'' he said.
	   The idea for the coalition has gathered strength since the
killing of outspoken liberal lawmaker Galina Starovoitova on Nov.
20. Sysuyev has said President Boris Yeltsin endorsed the idea.
	   Her death focused the fears of Russia's splintered liberals that
they might lose more power to Communist or nationalist forces.
	   Other organizers of the coalition include Yegor Gaidar, former
prime minister and leader of the reformist party Democratic Russia,
former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, and ex-deputy premiers
Anatoly Chubais and Boris Nemtsov.
	   The group calls itself a ``center-right'' bloc _ a term Russian
liberals use to distance themselves from Communists, who heavily
dominate the ``left'' of Russia's skewed political spectrum.
	   Russian liberal groups have been torn apart by rivalry in the
past, and the prospects of their union remained unclear.
	   Parliament speaker Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist, has predicted
that the group will quickly self-destruct in a battle over
leadership.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ France's oil giant Total SA will take
over Belgium's Petrofina SA, the companies announced Tuesday,
merging into the world's fifth largest oil company.
	   The announcement comes the same day that Exxon and Mobil created
the world's largest oil company in a record dlrs 77.2 billion
merger.
	   ``The move is part of a global change, oil prices have
practically been cut in half over the past year. All companies are
seeking to survive in this new situation,'' said Total Chairman
Thierry Desmarest. ``The business environment will be tougher than
in past years.''
	   The new company, known as Total Fina, would be the third-largest
oil company in Europe and the fifth largest overall. It will seek
to be listed on the Paris, Brussels, New York and London stock
exchanges, a joint statement said.
	   Employment totals would remain largely unchanged, with 69,100
people working for the new group, officials from the two companies
said.
	   ``The combination of Total and Petrofina will allow the new
entity to capture substantial productivity gains, particularly in
the North Sea, and to expand its positions in the deep offshore
(United States, Angola),'' a joint statement said.
	   The deal to create Total Fina is based on a stock swap that
gives Total control of 41 percent of Petrofina, Belgium's largest
industrial company. The remainder of Petrofina's shares will be bid
on at a later date, company officials said.
	   A combined general meeting of shareholders has been called for
Jan. 14 to approve the agreement.
	   Petrofina, which employs 14,700 people worldwide, is one of
Belgium's biggest industrial companies, with refining and
distribution operations in Europe and the United States.
	   Total SA employs 54,400 and is France's No. 2 oil company, but
has recently expanded its crude oil and gas businesses.
	   Investors on the Paris stock exchange reacted skeptically to the
new merger. Total shares took a big hit, falling 11 percent 79
French francs (dlrs 13.8) Tuesday, and stood at 626 French francs
(dlrs 109.8) in afternoon trading.
	   Petrofina in Brussels was up 20.4 percent in late afternoon
trading, winning 2,900 Belgian francs (dlrs 83) and stood at 17,150
Belgian francs (dlrs 491).
	   Before the deal was announced, the two companies had stock worth
1,391 billion Belgian francs (dlrs 39.9 billion).
	   Petrofina stock has been gaining ground in recent days on rumors
that the company was in talks with France's Elf Aquitaine SA, Total
SA and Italy's ENI SpA.
	   Petrofina's stock stood at 14,250 francs (dlrs 407.9) Friday
before trading was suspended Monday. The deal valued the stock at
19.482 francs (dlrs 557.7) _ an increase of more than one-third.
	   ``We have to recognize that the value today is higher than what
we could get as a stand-alone company in the medium term,'' said
Francois Cornelis, head of Petrofina.

Suspected suicide bomb kills one, injures nine in Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DIYARBAKIR, Turkey (AP) _ An explosion here Tuesday on a busy
shopping street killed a young woman officials suspected was a
Kurdish suicide bomber, the Turkish news agency Anatolia reported.
	   At least nine people were injured in the blast in the town of
Lice, in southeastern Turkey, the heart of the 14-year-old war for
Kurdish autonomy.
	   The cause of the blast was not known but Anatolia said officials
suspected a suicide bombing by Kurdish rebels.
	   The dead person was in her late teens, the report said. Female
militants have in the past carried out suicide bomb attacks in
southeast with explosives strapped to their waists. Last month, a
Kurdish woman died setting off a bomb last month near a military
garrison that wounded two others.
	   The blast could discredit claims by rebel Kurdish leader,
Abdullah Ocalan, who was detained in Rome last month, that the
group is renouncing violence in the struggle for autonomy for
Kurds.
	   Close to 37,000 people have been killed since Ocalan's group
began fighting in 1984.

Malaysian leader invites dissident's supporters to form political
</HEADLINE>
party

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad on Tuesday dared his detractors to form a political party
and challenge him in a general election.
	   ``(If) they want to set up a political party, its okay, if they
dare,'' Mahathir told local reporters.
	   The Malaysian leader said authorities would approve the
formation of a new political party if it eschewed street protests
and promised not to hold demonstrations.
	   ``But if they say they want to form a political party (because
they want) to shoot and kill people and hold demonstrations every
day, we will not give the approval,'' Bernama news agency quoted
him as saying after he inaugurated a new Malaysia-made small
aircraft.
	   Supporters of jailed former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim
have gathered repeatedly in the capital city of Kuala Lumpur in
recent weeks to hold mostly peaceful anti-government
demonstrations.
	   Anwar's supporters have shouted slogans demanding an end to
Mahathir's 17-year rule and burned portraits of the prime minister.
	   Police in the Southeast Asian country have responded by using
water cannons to disperse the crowds and arresting hundreds of
anti-government activists.
	   Mahathir suggested that Anwar's supporters form an electoral
party rather than organize protests that disrupt traffic and local
commerce.
	   But a general election is not scheduled until 2000.
	   ``In the election, they can contest, they can also curse ...I am
used to being cursed by them, so it does not make much of a
difference to me,'' he said.
	   Mahathir fired his Anwar, his former protege, on Sept. 2
alleging that he was too immoral to rule. Anwar was subsequently
arrested and is facing trial on 10 counts of abuse of office and
illegal sex.
	   He has denied all the charges against him, saying they were
politically motivated.

Death toll from cold at 66 in Poland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ More than two weeks of freezing weather
has killed at least 66 people in Poland, well over the total who
died from the cold last winter, police said Tuesday.
	   Police spokeswoman Grazyna Puchalska said 54 cold-related deaths
were reported all of last winter.
	   An Arctic cold front that hit Poland on Nov. 16, sending
temperatures as low as minus 26 Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit),
claimed its 66th victim Monday, a 20-year-old man whose body was
found lying outside in the Warsaw area, according to police.
	   Like in most of the cold-related deaths in Poland, the man
appeared to have passed out after drinking alcohol, police said.
	   Tuesday's low temperature in Warsaw was minus 12 Celsius (10
Fahrenheit).

	   Speedway president Tony George has scheduled a news conference
for Wednesday morning amid speculation the international race
series would return to the United States for the first time since
1991.
	   Spokesman Fred Nation would not confirm a deal had been
finalized, although two months ago he said George and Formula One
president Bernie Ecclestone had met three times this year to
discuss the possibility of bringing a race to the United States'
most famous track.
	   George first submitted a proposal to Ecclestone in March.
	   At another meeting with Ecclestone in June, George proposed a
multi-year commitment, reportedly calling for the Speedway to put
up dlrs 10 million to host the race and spend another dlrs 15
million to build a road course in and around the existing
4-kilometer (2 1-2-mile) oval track.
	   Other American cities believed to have made bids were San
Francisco, Las Vegas and Atlanta.
	   ``The difference with us and (the other cities) is that we have
everything in place to do a deal tomorrow,'' George said at that
time. ``No one else does.''
	   The only Formula One race in North America now is the Canadian
Grand Prix held in Montreal in June.
	   The Indianapolis 500 was the only race at the speedway until
1994, when the Brickyard 400 was added as part of NASCAR's premier
Winston Cup stock car series. This year, the International Race of
Champions, another stock car series sanctioned by NASCAR (the
National Association of Stock Car Auto Racing) also made Indy part
of its season tour.
	   The last Formula One race in the United States was at Phoenix in
1991. The series competed at Watkins Glen in the 1960s and '70s and
was joined by a second U.S. Grand Prix in Long Beach, California,
in the mid-'70s.
	   The Watkins Glen race was moved to the streets of downtown
Detroit in the 1980s, then because of escalating costs Long Beach
and Detroit switched to Indy-car races and Formula One organized
less successful events in Las Vegas, Dallas and Phoenix.
	   A U.S. Grand Prix at Indianapolis would require major
renovations that probably would begin immediaately after the 1999
Brickyard 400.
	   George earlier proposed using the track's existing first and
second turns and most of the front straightaway, although a new
section of track for a road course would have to be built in the
infield. Also, installing the necessary 24 pit-side garages would
require removing a portion of the grandstand behind the existing
pit road.

Australia defies UN by giving uranium project green light
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's conservative government
has defied a U.N. body's declaration that Kakadu National Park is a
World Heritage area, saying it will allow uranium mining within the
park.
	   ``We are quite satisfied with all the Australian processes for
approval of the mine,'' Australian Environment Minister Robert Hill
said.
	   The U.N. Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization had
recommended that all mining activities cease at the mine, even as
it gave the Australian government six months to respond to the
ruling.
	   The U.N. panel said the mine, which could process 19.5 million
metric tons of uranium ore over its 28-year life, could damage the
environment.
	   Environment Minister Hill, however, said a comprehensive
rebuttal would be compiled to refute the UNESCO report, which he
has described as superficial and unbalanced.
	   He added that he would not stop uranium miner Energy Resources
of Australia from carrying out its planned mining of uranium at the
site, which is still 18 months away.
	   ``The mine is not in a world heritage listed area nor in a
national park and it will cause neither environmental nor cultural
damage,'' Hill said.
	   UNESCO's report, made after only a four-day visit to the mine
site, ignored the enormous body of evidence gathered over 18 years
of mining at Ranger, located just 12 miles (20 km) from Jabiluka,
he said.
	   The local Mirrar Aboriginal people have been among the most
vocal critics of the project, which although actually inside the
Northern Territory national park, has been technically excluded as
an enclave within it.
	   Australia's environmental groups reacted immediately to Hill's
announcement saying it would seriously damage Australia's
reputation.
	   Greens party Senator Bob Brown said, ``Even major uranium buyers
like France, Japan and the U.S. _ members of the World Heritage
Committee _ voted to stop this obscene mine.''
	   ``If Australia defies the world umpire on the World Heritage
Convention, no treaty will be seen as safe,'' Brown added.
	   Environmentalists say reputable surveys show that 82 percent of
Australians oppose mining in areas like Kakadu.
	   They claim that the government's rebuttal of the UNESCO report
shows it to be both arrogant and out of touch with its own people
and the rest of the world.
	   Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles (31,200 sq. km.) of flood
plains and plateau on Australia's north coast, with waterfalls and
hundreds of animal species, including many that are rare or
endangered.
	   The park is one of a handful listed for both environmental and
cultural values. About 200,000 tourists visit the park every year.

Israeli defense minister: Greece turned down maneuver offer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said
Tuesday that Greece turned down his invitation to carry out a joint
operation in the Mediterranean after Israel and Turkey held similar
exercises in the area.
	   Turkey is Greece's traditional rival, and Greece has been
watching the growing Israeli-Turkish military alliance with some
concern.
	   ``We invited them to a humanitarian exercise at sea more than a
year ago and they refused,'' Mordechai said, according to his
spokesman, Avi Benayahu.
	   ``They were invited once again to hold such an exercise'' while
the Greek air force commander, Lt. Gen. Giorgos Antonetzis, visited
Israel on Tuesdayu, Benayahu said. Benayahu did not say how the
Greek visitor responded.
	   Turkey and Greece remain at odds over Cyprus, divided since
Turkish forces invaded its northern third to protect the Turkish
minority after a short-lived coup by supporters of union with
Greece in 1974.
	   Mordechai said he supported a diplomatic solution to the Cyprus
conflict.
	   The Greek air force already has several defense contracts with
Israel, including the maintenance of F-16 fighter planes.

Emirates allows entry to foreigners with Israeli visa stamps
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ The United Arab Emirates is
allowing entry to foreigners who have visited Israel, an
immigration official said Tuesday.
	   The Emirates began permitting foreigners with Israeli visa
stamps in their passports to enter the country about three months
ago under orders from the Interior Ministry, the official said. He
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Most Arab countries, including the United Arab Emirates, do not
have diplomatic relations with Israel and for years did not allow
entry to anyone who had visited the Jewish state.
	   In recent years, Oman and Qatar established low-level trade
relations with Israel and began allowing Israelis _ as well as
foreigners with Israeli visa stamps _ to enter.
	   Kuwait allows British, U.S. and French citizens to enter if they
have Israeli visas in their passports and evaluates others on a
case-by-case basis, an immigration official at the airport said.
	   The other Arab Gulf states _ Bahrain and Saudi Arabia _ ban
entry to anyone with an Israeli visa stamp.
	   Egypt and Jordan, which have peace treaties with Israel, and
some North African nations also allow Israeli visitors as well as
foreigners who have visited the Jewish state.

EU offers hopes of reprieve for duty-free shopping
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Hopes of a reprieve for duty free sales
for travelers within the European Union rose Tuesday as support for
a planned abolition appeared to fade among EU finance ministers.
	   France proposed extending the life of the popular tax-free sales
on flights, ports and ferry crossings for five years beyond June
30, 1999, when the EU is scheduled to scrap them. Germany and
Britain expressed support for the proposal.
	   However, any bid to save duty-free shopping needs the backing of
all 15 EU nations and not all were ready to agree. Swedish Finance
Minister Erik Asbrink was one who refused to budge. ``The position
is unchanged,'' he told reporters.
	   In 1991, EU nations all voted to abolish the tax free shopping,
claiming it was incompatible with the notion of a borderless EU
market. Now they need unanimity to reverse that decision.
	   Airlines, shipping companies and labor unions have pursued a
high-profile campaign to reverse save duty-free. They claimed
abolition of the dlrs 6.4-billion-a-year duty free industry will
push up the cost of travel and throw some 150,000 people out of
work.
	   The EU Commission argues that duty-free operators effectively
enjoy a subsidy of dlrs 2.2 billion a year by not paying duties on
their sales, giving them an unfair advantage over other retailers.
	   The ban only affects sales for travelers within the EU. Those
traveling to or from the Union will still be able to enjoy tax free
shopping.

Cuba declares Christmas permanent holiday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Christmas in Cuba is back for good.
	   The Communist Party on Tuesday used the entire front page of
Cuba's only daily newspaper, Granma, to recommend that ``from this
year on,'' Dec. 25 should be a holiday in Cuba, formally
re-establishing a custom that had been abolished in 1970.
	   The proposal is sure to be adopted by the communist country's
government.
	   The government granted a Christmas holiday last year as a
one-time favor to Pope John Paul II, who visited in January. But at
the time it balked at declaring the measure permanent.
	   Cuba abolished the Christmas holiday in 1970, arguing that it
interfered with the mobilization of manpower for the sugar harvest.
	   The party declaration insisted that the abolition of the holiday
in 1970 was not inspired by any antireligious sentiment.
	   However the government at the time was avowedly atheist and
Christians were barred from being members of the Communist Party or
of holding many sensitive jobs.
	   Christmas trees were strongly discouraged.
	   In recent years, the government has declared itself secular
rather than atheist, has dropped restrictions on Christians and
moved to improve ties with Cuba's churches and other religions.
	   The Roman Catholic archbishop's office, contacted by telephone,
said it had no immediate reaction.

Malaysian leader invites dissident's supporters to form political

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad on Tuesday dared his detractors to form a political party
and challenge him in a general election.
	   ``(If) they want to set up a political party, its okay, if they
dare,'' Mahathir told local reporters.
	   The Malaysian leader said authorities would approve the
formation of a new political party if it eschewed street protests
and promised not to hold demonstrations.
	   ``But if they say they want to form a political party (because
they want) to shoot and kill people and hold demonstrations every
day, we will not give the approval,'' Bernama news agency quoted
him as saying after he inaugurated a new Malaysia-made small
aircraft.
	   Supporters of jailed former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim
have gathered repeatedly in the capital city of Kuala Lumpur in
recent weeks to hold mostly peaceful anti-government
demonstrations.
	   Anwar's supporters have shouted slogans demanding an end to
Mahathir's 17-year rule and burned portraits of the prime minister.
	   Police in the Southeast Asian country have responded by using
water cannons to disperse the crowds and arresting hundreds of
anti-government activists.
	   Mahathir suggested that Anwar's supporters form an electoral
party rather than organize protests that disrupt traffic and local
commerce.
	   But a general election is not scheduled until 2000.
	   ``In the election, they can contest, they can also curse ...I am
used to being cursed by them, so it does not make much of a
difference to me,'' he said.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar, his former protege, on Sept. 2 alleging
that he was too immoral to rule. Anwar was subsequently arrested
and is facing trial on 10 counts of abuse of office and illegal
sex.
	   He has denied all the charges against him, saying they were
politically motivated.

Palestinians deny misuse of European housing funds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
Authority on Tuesday disputed a published report asserting it had
spent money earmarked for low-income housing on luxury apartments
for wealthy Arafat associates.
	   ``I don't see any corruption in housing,'' Palestinian Housing
Minister Abdel Rahman Hamad told reporters in response to a report
in the Sunday Times of London.
	   The report came a day before a conference of international
donors in Washington at which more than 43 nations pledged a total
of more than dlrs 3 billion in aid to the Palestinians.
	   Palestinian officials feared the allegations, coupled with
previous findings of corruption, would dampen enthusiasm for
providing aid.
	   At a news conference, the Palestinian housing minister said
low-income Palestinians were indeed the chief beneficiaries of
subsidized housing in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   He said 90 percent of the buyers of 922 European Union-funded
housing units in Gaza had incomes of less than dlrs 600 a month.
	   He acknowledged that buyers did include some Arafat associates
who returned from exile with the start of Palestinian autonomy in
the Gaza Strip.
	   But he said the application process for purchasing the units had
been open to all, and that apartment sales were carried out under
joint EU supervision.
	   Hamad also called the newspaper's description of luxury features
at some of the EU-funded apartments unfair. He said the units were
built according to simple, basic specifications, and that extras
like satellite dishes and custom-styling came at the expense of
individual owners.
	   The report also suggested that the units were unusually
spacious, but the housing minister said their size _ 90 to 100
square meters _ was normal for Palestinian families, which tend to
be large.
	   Of those living in housing built with European Union backing in
Gaza, Hamad said 136 were unemployed, 193 worked in the private
sector, 55 were employed by non-governmental organizations, 48
worked for the United Nations, 189 worked for civilian ministries
in the Palestinian Authority and 301 were employed by the
Palestinian security forces.
	   At the donor conference, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said disbursement of American funds would be closely
monitored. Hamad said the Palestinians welcomed the scrutiny.
	   ``We don't want donors to use this (worry over corruption) as an
excuse not to provide aid,'' he said.

EU, NKorea to hold first-ever talks at EU head office
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union and North Korea
officials will hold first-ever talks here Wednesday on issues
ranging from human rights to food aid to security on the Korean
peninsula.
	   ``We are quite pleased North Korea has agreed to debate a broad
agenda of issues,'' EU spokesman Nigel Gardner said Tuesday.
	   He said the EU wants to see if the Europeans can have a regular,
political dialogue with North Korea.
	   The EU side will include mid-level officials from Austria,
Britain and Germany and Percy Westerlund, a Swede who is director
general at the European Commission's foreign affairs office.
	   Gardner said the discussion will also touch on efforts by Japan,
South Korea, the United States and the EU to build two nuclear
reactors replacing North Korea's own nuclear program that was
suspected of developing atomic weapons.
	   They formed a consortium in 1994, known as the Korean Peninsula
Energy Development Organization, that recently approved a new dlrs
4.6 billion estimate for the two reactors.
	   KEDO was created after North Korea agreed to freeze and
eventually dismantle its nuclear weapons program in exchange for
two light-water nuclear power plants and 500,000-ton annual fuel
oil shipments until they are completed.
	   The reactors are due to be ready for use by 2003 and will
replace North Korea's Soviet-developed graphite-moderated reactors
that produce greater amounts of weapons-grade plutonium.
	   The goal of controlling nuclear proliferation has taken on new
urgency since India and Pakistan conducted nuclear test explosions
in May, raising international concern the entire system of
international nuclear controls might unravel.

	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ American fugitive Ira Einhorn appeared
in court Tuesday for a hearing to determine whether he'll be
extradited to the United States for the brutal 1977 murder of his
girlfriend. The court said it would rule on Jan. 12.
	   The 57-year-old fugitive was defiant as he again denied killing
Helen ``Holly'' Maddux, whose corpse was found in a trunk in his
closet.
	   ``One thing,'' Einhorn said, pointing his finger at the judge.
``I did not kill Holly Maddux. C'est tout (That's all.)''
	   That was Einhorn's only statement, and it left Maddux's siblings
shaking their heads in disbelief.
	   ``It was a clear attempt to provoke some outburst from us,''
said Elisabeth Hall, the victim's sister. ``He's a pitiful
character and knows exactly what he has done.''
	   Einhorn has been sentenced in absentia to life in prison by a
Pennsylvania court for the murder.
	   A prominent anti-war campaigner and New Age activist in the
1960s, Einhorn fled the United States shortly before he was due to
be tried. But after 16 years in hiding, he was tracked down and
arrested at his French home in June 1997.
	   Einhorn looked relaxed during the two-hour hearing, only
occasionally glancing at the three sisters and brother of his
alleged victim.
	   He entered the court building Tuesday holding hands with his
companion, Anika Flodin, and refused to answer questions.
	   But the Ms. Hall was more outspoken.
	   ``We are here in France to remind the judges that underneath all
this international law and political squabbling, there is a person
who was murdered and who looks like us,'' Hall said.
	   ``Anybody can see there has been a definite undercurrent of
anti-Americanism,'' she said.
	   A French court refused to extradite Einhorn in December 1997,
citing a French law that would have required a retrial if he was
extradited. Pennsylvania then passed a law promising Einhorn a
retrial. He was re-arrested in September.
	   His defense lawyers argue that, if extradited, Einhorn could
face the death penalty, which is banned under French law. They also
claim Pennsylvania courts might withdraw the pledge of a retrial.
	   In a November interview on ABC television, Einhorn declared his
innocence and claimed the CIA or KGB framed him after he uncovered
classified mind-control experiments.
	   When Maddux, a former cheerleader from Tyler, Texas,
disappeared, Einhorn said she had gone shopping and never returned.
	   But 18 months later, neighbors told police of a stench coming
from Einhorn's apartment, and Maddux's battered remains were found.
Forensic experts said her skull had been smashed six times.

Kosovo conflict tops agenda for OSCE ministers in Oslo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The risky job of nurturing peace in the
troubled Kosovo province of Yugoslavia is at the top of the agenda
for a meeting of about 60 European nations that opens in Oslo on
Wednesday.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is
sending 2,000 unarmed observers to Kosovo in hopes of ending the
slaughter of ethnic Albanian civilians and keeping mainly ethnic
Serb police and troops in check.
	   OSCE member delegations, including 45 foreign ministers, are
expected to adopt a resolution at their two-day Oslo meeting giving
full support to the difficult mission.
	   ``This is the biggest and most significant task the OSCE has
ever taken upon itself,'' said Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut
Vollebaek, who assumed the organization's rotating chairmanship in
January.
	   Several hundred people have been killed and up to 300,000
people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been displaced since Serbia
launched a crackdown on Kosovo separatists in February. Kosovo is a
province of Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Faced with an imminent NATO air strike against his forces,
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed in October to a
U.S.-brokered truce that is shaky and troubled by sporadic
violence.
	   Vollebaek said about 400 monitors from the Kosovo Verification
Mission are already in place in Kosovo, and will continue arriving
at the rate of about 250 a week until the full number is reached by
the second half of January.
	   He said there is no question that this is a risky and difficult
mission.
	   ``I think it can turn critical at any time,'' Vollebaek said at
a pre-meeting briefing in Oslo. ``We will have 2,000 observers who
almost continuously will be in dangerous situations.''
	   Vollebaek said a great deal of responsibility rests on Milosevic
to ensure the safety of the observers, and that NATO remains ready
to protest the foreign monitors if the need arise.
	   ``But what I hope for and want is a political process that leads
to a real political settlement,'' Vollebaek said.
	   The Norwegian foreign minister was disappointed that some of the
heavyweights of the OSCE, including the United States and Britain,
were not sending their highest-level delegations.
	   Both U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and British
Foreign Minister Robin Cook have said they cannot attend.
	   The meeting, which lasts until midday Thursday, will also touch
on a broad range of European security topics, including Bosnia,,
the Russian breakaway republic of Chechnya and Albania.
	   Vollebaek also said Austria was expected to be elected to chair
the organization for the year 2000, and that next year's OSCE
summit would be held in Istanbul, Turkey sometime in October.
	   In addition to its 54 member nations, such countries as Japan,
South Korea, Algeria, Egypt and Israel were sending observers.

Ukraine's parliament overrides Kuchma's veto on tax law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's opposition-dominated parliament
voted without dissent Tuesday to override President Leonid Kuchma's
veto on a law that forbids the president from setting taxes and
granting exemptions.
	   The Verkhovna Rada voted 342-0 with one abstention to annul
Kuchma's veto, the latest in a series of parliamentary blows to the
president.
	   Kuchma argued that the law could decrease budget revenues
because it would not allow the president to change excise and
import taxes if and when necessary, and that it would require a
long, cumbersome procedure for changing tax legislation.
	   Serhiy Teriokhin of the Rada's finance committee urged
parliament on Tuesday to override Kuchma's veto, because Ukraine's
constitution grants lawmakers exclusive rights to determine federal
tax rates and benefits.
	   Kuchma has often used constitutional loopholes to pass economic
decisions he said were necessary to push through reforms in the
former Soviet republic.
	   In response, Kuchma's leftist and centrist opponents in
parliament have moved recently to adopt several laws that
significantly limit his powers.
	   Earlier this month, parliament voted to approve changes to the
budgetary system law, annulling a provision that allows the
president to stop or limit state spending on certain budget
articles.
	   The lawmakers said the provision also contradicted Ukraine's
constitution.
	   Kuchma refused to sign the new version of the law.
	   The latest legislative changes preceded debates on Ukraine's
1999 draft budget, expected to start in parliament on Wednesday,
and appeared to be an attempt to deprive Kuchma of the possibility
of introducing unexpected changes in the budget.
	   The Rada is demanding serious changes to the Cabinet's draft
budget, in particular reducing the already tiny planned deficit and
boosting revenues to allow more spending for social needs.

Kenya, Ethiopia pledge to monitor common border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYERI, Kenya (AP) _ Kenya and Ethiopia Tuesday pledged to
monitor and maintain law and order along their common border where
a recent attack on herders left at least 140 people dead.
	   The pledge was contained in a joint statement issued at the end
of a three-day meeting in Kenya's Eastern Province on deteriorating
security in the area.
	   Early last month armed men from southern Ethiopia attacked
nomads at a watering hole in northeastern Kenya, killing 140
people, kidnapping another 52 and making off with 17,500 cattle and
camels.
	   Survivors _ ethnic Somalis living in Kenya for generations _
said many of the attackers were well-armed members of the Oromo
tribe from southern Ethiopia.
	   The Oromo Liberation Front, which seeks independence from
Ethiopia for much of southern Ethiopia, crosses back and forth into
Kenya.
	   The joint statement said a regular exchange of information about
activities along the border was necessary to increase security.
	   Northeastern Province Commissioner Maurice Makhanu, who headed
the Kenyan delegation, called for an all-out effort to enhance
peace and security in the area.
	   The 18-man Ethiopian delegation was headed by Federal Police
Commissioner Maj. Alemseged G. Yohannes.
	   The talks centered on border security and cooperation between
the two countries including illegal movement of people, trafficking
of arms across the border, revival of radio communication between
the two security sides and cooperation on anti-terrorism. Other
areas covered were immigration, refugee matters and border
inspection and maintenance.
	   The delegates suggested that meetings be held twice a year and
fixed the next for April in Bahr-Dar, Ethiopia.

Portuguese Internet users stage 24-hour boycott
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ More than 3,000 Internet users in
Portugal began a 24-hour boycott Tuesday to protest what they call
costly and poor service for surfing the Web, news reports said.
	   The protesters urged people to stay off-line until midnight
Tuesday (0000 GMT) to protest against Portugal Telecom and the
country's three Internet access providers, the Lisbon radio station
TSF said.
	   They also complained about having to pay twice.
	   Portugal Telecom charges Internet users up to escudos 208 (about
dlrs 1.2) for each hour they are on-line. On top of that, the
access providers charge as much as escudos 5,000 (about dlrs 30)
for 30 hours of Internet use.

One-day work stoppage disrupts news flow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The all-news radio station, France Info, played
music and some TV newscasts went dim during a one-day strike
Tuesday by journalists protesting plans to do away with a 30
percent tax break.
	   It was impossible to measure the size of the work stoppage. The
afternoon newspaper Le Monde reported that at least two Parisian
newspapers, the conservative Le Figaro and the Communist
l'Humanite, would not publish Wednesday, along with numerous
regional papers.
	   Others were expected to put out shortened editions.
	   It was the third protest since former Prime Minister Alain Juppe
initiated legislation in 1996 to do away with tax breaks in 73
professions.
	   Unions have argued that the tax break constitutes a key element
of journalists' salaries.
	   Efforts to devise a means of eliminating the tax break without
making journalists feel the pinch quite so badly have so far come
to naught.

Nordics plan joint application for Euro 2008
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Share and share alike. That seems to be
the current fad for staging international soccer finals.
	   Belgium and the Netherlands will co-host the 2000 European
Championship, while South Korea and Japan will share the 2002 World
Cup finals.
	   Now, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway plan a joint
application for the 2008 European Championship.
	   Officials from the four national soccer federations have drawn
up plans for a joint application, although the deadline for the
application is still far off _ sometime in mid-2002.
	   In 1997, Sweden and Norway organized the women's World Cup
soccer finals.
	   The Swedish soccer federation's secretary-general Lars-Christer
Olsson has been assigned to draw up a report on how to harmonize
tax regulations for the finals.
	   ``We are counting on the same concept of 16 teams in the
finals,'' Swedish federation spokesman Goran Havik said.
	   That would imply one group in each country, and quarterfinals in
each country.
	   The semifinals would likely be played in Finland and Norway.
	   The final would be played in the Swedish west coast city of
Goteborg at Ullevi Stadium, which hosted the 1992 European
Championship soccer final and the 1995 Track and Field World
Championships.
	   ``It is the largest arena (seating 43,000) and Goteborg is used
to big events,'' Havik said.
	   The site for the 2004 European Championship will be selected by
UEFA in June. Hungary and Austria have entered a joint bid, with
Spain and Portugal also in the running.

Arafat to visit Sweden, Norway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will
travel this weekend to the capitals of Sweden and Norway, both
countries that have played roles in the Middle East peace process.
	   On Saturday, Arafat is to take part in a Middle East conference
in Stockholm, called to mark the 10th anniversary of Arafat's
statement in the Swedish capital that the Palestine Liberation
Organization recognized Israel's right to exist.
	   Representatives from Israel and the United States have also been
invited to Stockholm for the meeting, but they did not say who
would attend.
	   ``We are not counting on representatives coming from the United
States and Israel on such a high level as (Israeli prime minister
Benjamin) Netanyahu and Madeleine Albright,'' the U.S. Secretary of
State, Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh said Tuesday.
	   Whatever the representation, ``we can at least have a good and
profitable discussion,'' Lindh said.
	   On Sunday, Arafat is to make a stopover in Oslo, Norway, said
Norwegian foreign ministry spokesman Ingvard Havnen. Arafat was
invited by Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek.
	   Although the Oslo stopped is planned to last only a few hours,
any trip by Palestinian or Israeli officials to the Norwegian
capital has symbolic weight because the Israel-PLO peace accord was
worked out in secret negotiations in Norway that became known as
the ``Oslo Channel.''
	   The peace process has often stalled since Netanyahu became prime
minister.
	   The process appeared to move forward last week after Israel
began the first stage of its agreed withdrawl from 13 percent of
the West Bank by the end of January. In exchange, Palestinians
agreed to take measures against Islamic militants.
	   But new acrimony arose this week when Netanyahu said he would
walk away from the peace agreements if Arafat unilaterally declares
Palestinian statehood in May. The Palestinians contend the peace
agreements do not prevent such a declaration after the end of a
five-year period of autonomy.
	   The Palestinians also contend that Israel has breached an
agreement to release 750 prisoners. In the first stage of the
release, most of the 250 set free were criminals; the Palestinians
demand that Israel free political activists and those jailed for
anti-Israeli activities.

Oil executive kidnapped in Chechnya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An executive with a Chechen oil company was
abducted in breakaway Chechnya on Tuesday by assailants apparently
seeking ransom, the latest such crime in a region awash with
kidnappings.
	   Kaid Gaziyev, who worked as deputy director of the Grozneft oil
company, was kidnapped in the Chechen capital Grozny, the Interfax
news agency reported, quoting Supyan Saidov, an officer with
Chechnya's anti-kidnapping squad.
	   The attackers apparently hoped to get ransom for Gaziyev and
embarrass the government in this southern Russian republic, which
recently launched a crackdown on abductions, Saidov said.
	   President Aslan Maskhadov has pledged to stop a wave of
kidnappings and other crime that has swept Chechnya since the
1994-96 war with Russia, but he has failed to deliver, as numerous
warlords have resisted government control.
	   According to Saidov, 111 people, including Russians and several
foreigners, remain in captivity. Russian officials have put the
number at several hundred.
	   Chechnya has run its own affairs since Russian troops withdrew
in the fall of 1996, but no country recognizes its independence bid
and Moscow insists that it remains part of Russia.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A former head of Romanian foreign
intelligence was quoted Tuesday as saying he will resign his
present post as ambassador to Bulgaria after acknowledging that he
hurt Swiss-Romanian relations in his previous job.
	   Ioan Talpes, head of foreign intelligence from 1992 to 1997,
resigned that position last year after admitting to a long-running
contact between a Swiss diplomat and his foreign intelligence
agents that he said had compromised ties with Switzerland.
	   Talpes, 54, was quoted by the Mediafax news agency as saying he
would stay on as ambassador until Dec. 20, a year after he was
appointed by President Emil Constantinescu.

Myanmar bars British officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Myanmar has barred British ministers and officials
from the country following British pressure on the military regime
to hold talks with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   The Foreign Office announced Tuesday that the military regime in
Rangoon said no minister or officials will receive a visa to enter
the country, also known as Burma.
	   Last month, Foreign Office minister Derek Fatchett called for a
European Union mission, including Britain, to visit Myanmar in an
attempt to improve human rights in the country, which has been
under military rule since 1962.
	   Britain also discourages companies from putting new investment
into Myanmar.
	   ``I regret this move by the Burmese regime,'' Fatchett said
Tuesday. ``It will in no way dissuade us from continuing to work
for an improvement in the human rights and the political situation
in Burma and bringing pressure on the regime to enter into dialogue
with democratic leaders.''
	   Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, has been locked
in a battle of wills with the ruling council of generals over
demands that a parliament elected in 1990 be convened. Her National
League for Democracy won the elections, but the military never
allowed Parliament to meet.
	   The EU has already placed sanctions on the Myanmar regime
including an arms embargo, putting restrictions on visas and
suspending non-humanitarian aid.
	   ``The visa ban is an acknowledgment that the U.K. is at the
forefront of international action to bring pressure on the Burmese
regime to improve the human rights and political situation in
Burma,'' a Foreign Office spokesman said anonymously, in keeping
with British practice.

Ukrainian court sentences three men to death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A court in the southern Ukrainian city of
Kherson sentenced three men to death for killing two elderly people
and a child to steal an old radio and childrens' toys, a newspaper
reported Tuesday.
	   Oleksander Krypakov, Roman Yakovenko and Oleksander Makarov had
decided to rob a Kherson house belonging to an elderly couple, but
the house turned out to be full of guests, Kievskiye Vedomosti
reported.
	   The trio _ described as repeat offenders _ killed the owner of
the house, an elderly friend and a 10-year-old girl who also was
visiting. The owner's wife and another visitor, an 11-year-old boy,
managed to escape.
	   The attackers' loot was valued at 69 hryvna (dlrs 20 at the
current rate), Kievskiye Vedomosti said. It did not say when the
crime occurred.
	   The three killers are unlikely to be executed as Ukraine imposed
a moratorium on capital punishment last year to meet its
obligations as a member of the Council of Europe, the continent's
leading human rights body. Ukrainian courts have sentenced more
than 80 people to death in 1998, though none has been executed.

European Union opens information office in Hungary
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with Hungarian premier quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The Hungarian premier criticized the
European Union Tuesday for procrastinating, while only a few blocks
away the European Union inaugurated an information center in
downtown Budapest.
	   Speeking at a business development meeting, Prime Minister
Viktor Orban called for better dialogue with the EU and a concrete
timetable for accession by those former communist countries who are
likely to be the first to join the EU.
	   ``It is difficult to understand why it took eight years to get
into NATO or why it is not obvious that Hungary shouldn't join the
EU as soon as possible, why there is no deadline or timeframe for
our accession process,'' Orban said.
	   Hungary was among the first former communist countries, along
with the Czech Republic and Poland, to be invited to join NATO, and
is expected to become a full member within the next few months.
	   Hungary is also among the first nations, along with Poland,
Czech Republic, Estonia and Slovenia under consideration for the
first round of EU enlargement.
	   But Orban said there are grounds to fear the EU will seek to
exempt Hungary and other new members from standard EU regulations
for an extended period of time, beyond what they feel is necessary.
	   The exemptions, known as derogations, are aimed at ensuring the
balance between existing EU employment and economic standards,
while still participating in most political, cultural and other
organizations.
	   ``There is a new fear now in Hungary _ and not only in Hungary,
but in the Czech Republic and Poland as well _ that probably the
European Union will ask for more difficult derogations than Hungary
will ask for,'' Orban said, speaking in English.
	   Orban said Hungary and the other prospective members should not
be exempted from free movement of labor, agricultural policy, and
access to structural funds used to help underdeveloped regions.
	   ``In these three fields, it seems major requests will come from
the EU's side, that is, it will have proposals to depart from
regulations within the integration,'' Orban said.
	   Existing EU members are worried that without these exemptions,
vast numbers of workers will flood the West in search of jobs,
cheap agricultural produce will flood the existing market.
	   For its own part, Hungary would like to set up exemptions
preventing EU nationals from buying arable land in the country,
since real estate in Hungary is very cheap compared to Western
prices.
	   Also Tuesday, the EU opened an information center in the same
building as Budapest's city hall, aimed at familiarizing people
with the institutions of the EU.
	   The center offers services to people interested in EU-related
topics, such as regulations, policies, and legislation from
agriculture to security and foreign policy through EU databases via
the Internet, CD-ROMs, video tapes, as well as read books and
brochures.

Bosnians receiving first shipment of new coins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A shipment of nine million
newly minted coins reached Bosnia Tuesday to replace chewing gum
and chocolate bars as the country's loose change.
	   The coins, hot from London's Royal Mint, are the first to reach
Bosnia since the summer when the country introduced a new currency,
theKonvertibilna Marka. The currency, valued at one German Mark
(dlrs 0.63) was issued only in bank notes until now.
	   Due to the lack of coinage, Bosnian shops use chewing gum as
ersatz 10 Fencing coins and small chocolate bars to replace coins
of 20 Fineness. There are 100 Fineness to theMarka
	   ``We will waste no time in putting the coins into circulation
... so that people can feel them jingling in their pockets,'' said
Peter Nickel, the governor of Bosnia's Central Bank. ``A sound that
symbolizes a solid future, built on a sound currency.''
	   The first coin shipment totals 936,000 Konvertibilna Marka.
	   The 10, 20 and 50 Fening coins are to be put into general
circulation in December.
	   While shops had given chewing gum and chocolate bars as small
change, they refused to accept them as payment for goods. Many
customers are left with large candy stashes.
	   Bosnia's market used four different currencies up until this
summer when the Kovertibilna Marka was launched. The Bosnian Serbs
used the Yugoslav Dinar, the Bosnian Croats the Croatian Kuna and
the central Muslim-dominated parts their own money. The German Mark
remains accepted everywhere.

Juventus general director defends decision of one-day trip to
</HEADLINE>
Istanbul &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Juventus top manager Luciano Moggi on
Tuesday defended as ``well grounded'' the club decision to stay a
single day in Istanbul for the politically tinged Champions League
match against Turkey's Galatasaray.
	   The Italian league champions, who need a victory against the
Turkish team to keep qualifying chances alive in the most titled
European soccer competition, decided to travel to Istanbul on the
match day Wednesday and return home immediately after the game.
	   UEFA, Europe's soccer governing body which requires teams to
arrive the day before of European Cup matches, was critical of
Juventus decision.
	   ``Juventus feels there are well grounded motives for failing to
conform to UEFA directives,'' said Moggi, the general director of
the Turin team which is owned by the Agnelli family of auto
tycoons.
	   Juventus confirmed on Tuesday its travel plans for the match
already postponed by one week after Italy's refusal to extradite a
Kurdish rebel leader prompted anti-Italian demonstrations in
Turkey.
	   Several Juventus players, who had initially refused to travel to
Instanbul, bowed to the club decision to play Galatasaray but
criticized the UEFA stand.
	   ``We have been forced to play a game conditioned by political
motives,'' said No.1 keeper Angelo Peruzzi.
	   Team captain Antonio Conte said Tuesday that the Italian
government and UEFA left the Italian team alone.
	   ``UEFA and the (Italian) government have claimed that there are
no secutiry problems in Istanbul ... but as far as we know no UEFA
and government representatives will be in Istanbul Wednesday,''
Conte told the Italian news agency ANSA.
	   Italian culture minister Giovanna Malendri, invited to attend
the game by her Turkish counterpart, said Tuesday she had not yet
taken a final decision about traveling to Istanbul.

Formula One champion Mika Hakkinen to get own postage stamp
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Finland will issue a postage stamp
honoring Formula One champion Mika Hakkinen, the post office
announced Tuesday.
	   Two million of the 3-markkaa (58-cent) stamp will be issued on
January 15, said Markku Penttinen from the post office's philatelic
center.
	   Foreign philatelists and racing fans had inquired if the post
office would issue a Hakkinen stamp if he won the championship,
Penttinen said.
	   ``We believed in his victory,'' Penttinen said. ``And we began
planning the stamp before the crucial race,'' in Japan on Nov. 1,
he said.
	   The stamp shows a smiling Hakkinen in silver overalls, holding
his arms up in a demonstration of victory.
	   Previously, the Finnish Post Office has issued stamps of leading
sports figures, including world rally champions Timo Makinen and
Juha Kankkunen.

Turkish premier says Germany or Italy should try Kurdish rebel
</HEADLINE>
leader &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on
Tuesday said that Italy or Germany should try a Kurdish rebel
leader detained in Rome if Turkey's extradition bid fails.
	   Speaking to members of his center-right party in Parliament,
Yilmaz said that if Italy refused to hand over rebel Kurdish leader
Abdullah Ocalan, ``the least you can do is to make sure that his
crimes do not remain unpunished.''
	   Turkey wants Ocalan extradited, but Italy refuses to hand him
over as its laws forbid extradition to countries, like Turkey,
where suspects may face the death penalty.
	   Ocalan is also wanted in Germany, but German officials, fearing
trouble among its Kurdish and Turkish immigrant population, say
they will not seek his extradition.
	   ``You issue a warrant for crimes committed on your territory ...
but then you shy away from trying him,'' Yilmaz added, in a clear
reference to Germany. ``What kind of a legal state is this?''
	   Turkey has been angered by a proposal by the prime ministers of
Germany and Italy for an international tribunal to try Ocalan,
which Ankara accuses of terrorism.
	   The PKK has been fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast
since 1984 in a war that has killed 37,000 people.
	   Turkey's approximately 12 million Kurds are not recognized as an
official minority and are denied education and broadcasting rights.

Westwood denies claims he dented Australian trophy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ English golfer Lee Westwood denies claims he
dented and damaged his replica of the Australian Open trophy.
	   Colin Phillips, executive director of the Australian Golf Union,
said the trophy had to be repaired by a Melbourne jeweler at a cost
of 8,500 pounds (dlrs 14,000).
	   Phillips said the cup was broken at the base and had dents in
the top when officials opened its velvet-lined shipping box.
	   Westwood is not defending his Australian title this week, opting
for the Million Dollar Challenge in Sun City, South Africa.
	   ``The trophy was returned on 21st September and duly signed for
by the Australian Golf Union as being received in perfect
condition,'' Westwood said Tuesday from South Africa.
	   ``I am surprised that two days prior to the Million Dollar
Challenge and the Australian Open they have decided to air their
grievances.''
	   Australian officials are apparently upset about Westwood's
withdrawal from the Australian Open and claim they got the news
secondhand, a charge Westwood also denied.
	   ``I withdrew on Sept. 2 explaining I had been invited to play in
the Million Dollar Challenge with the world's top 12 golfers,'' he
said.
	   Westwood was criticized early this year for withdrawing on short
notice from the Western Open in Chicago _ the week after the U.S.
Open. He also pulled out of the MCI Classic in South Carolina the
week after the U.S. Masters.
	   In Sun City, Westwood is trying to finish his season with a
third successive victory, having won twice last month in Japan.

Kosovo conflict tops agenda for OSCE ministers in Oslo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The risky job of nurturing peace in the
troubled Kosovo province of Yugoslavia is at the top of the agenda
for a meeting of about 60 European nations that opens Wednesday in
Oslo.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is
sending 2,000 unarmed observers to Kosovo in hopes of ending the
killing of ethnic Albanian civilians and keeping mainly ethnic Serb
police and troops in check.
	   OSCE member delegations, including 45 foreign ministers, are
expected to adopt a resolution at their two-day Oslo meeting giving
full support to the difficult mission.
	   ``This is the biggest and most significant task the OSCE has
ever taken upon itself,'' said Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut
Vollebaek, who assumed the organization's rotating chairmanship in
January.
	   Several hundred people have been killed and up to 300,000
people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been displaced since Serbia
launched a crackdown on Kosovo separatists in February. Kosovo is a
province of Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Faced with an imminent NATO airstrike against his forces,
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed in October to a
U.S.-brokered truce that is shaky and troubled by sporadic
violence.
	   Vollebaek said about 400 monitors from the Kosovo Verification
Mission are already in place in Kosovo, and will continue arriving
at the rate of about 250 a week until the full number is reached by
the second half of January.
	   Vollebaek said a great deal of responsibility rests on Milosevic
to ensure the safety of the observers, and that NATO remains ready
to protest the foreign monitors if the need arise.
	   ``But what I hope for and want is a political process that leads
to a real political settlement,'' Vollebaek said.
	   The Norwegian foreign minister was disappointed that some of the
heavyweights of the OSCE, including the United States and Britain,
were not sending their highest-level delegations.
	   Both U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and British
Foreign Minister Robin Cook have said they cannot attend.
	   The meeting, which lasts until midday Thursday, will also touch
on a broad range of European security topics, including Bosnia, the
Russian breakaway republic of Chechnya and Albania.
	   Vollebaek also said Austria was expected to be elected to chair
the organization for the year 2000, and that next year's OSCE
summit would be held in Istanbul, Turkey, in October.
	   In addition to its 54 member nations, such countries as Japan,
South Korea, Algeria, Egypt and Israel were sending observers.

Greens call for a lifting of the ban on Kurdish rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany should lift its ban on the
Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, a Greens politician said Tuesday,
arguing that it has increased tensions between Germany's Turkish
and Kurdish residents.
	   Angela Beers urged the new government to use the opportunity
created by the arrest in Rome of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan to push for a political solution to the Kurdish issue in
Turkey. PKK guerrillas have been fighting for a homeland in Turkey
since 1981.
	   Germany's 1993 ban has hindered any political progress by giving
Turkey a justification for its actions the Kurdish population,
which has in turn fueling tensions both in Turkey and in Germany,
Beers said. About 400,000 Kurds are among the 2 million Turks
living here.
	   Germany banned the party in 1993 after attacks on Turkish
consulates and businesses in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.
	   Beers and lawmaker Ulla Jelpke of the ex-communist Party of
Democratic Socialists are backing an initiative by the Kurdistan
Information Center in Cologne, which has collected 10,000
signatures to lift the PKK ban.
	   Ocalan was arrested on a German warrant, however Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder has refused to seek his extradition, citing fears
that a trial in Germany would lead to unrest.

 &UR; French court to decide fate of American fugitive in January &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from Einhorn; lawyer's argument, family's
reactions
 &UR; By IAN PHILLIPS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ American fugitive Ira Einhorn appeared
in court Tuesday for a hearing to determine whether he'll be
extradited to the United States for the brutal 1977 murder of his
girlfriend. The court said it would rule on Jan. 12.
	   The 57-year-old fugitive was defiant as he again denied killing
Helen ``Holly'' Maddux, whose corpse was found in a trunk in his
closet.
	   ``One thing,'' Einhorn said, pointing his finger at the judge.
``I did not kill Holly Maddux. C'est tout (That's all.)''
	   That was Einhorn's only statement, and it left Maddux's siblings
shaking their heads in disbelief.
	   ``It was a clear attempt to provoke some outburst from us,''
said Elisabeth Hall, the victim's sister. ``He's a pitiful
character and knows exactly what he has done.''
	   Einhorn has been sentenced in absentia to life in prison by a
Pennsylvania court for the murder.
	   A prominent anti-war campaigner and activist in the 1960s,
Einhorn fled the United States shortly before he was due to be
tried. But after 16 years in hiding, he was tracked down and
arrested at his French home in June 1997.
	   Einhorn looked relaxed during the two-hour hearing, only
occasionally glancing at the three sisters and brother of his
alleged victim.
	   He entered the court building Tuesday holding hands with his
companion, Anika Flodin, and refused to answer questions.
	   But the Ms. Hall was more outspoken.
	   ``We are here in France to remind the judges that underneath all
this international law and political squabbling, there is a person
who was murdered and who looks like us,'' Hall said.
	   ``Anybody can see there has been a definite undercurrent of
anti-Americanism,'' she said.
	   A French court refused to extradite Einhorn in December 1997,
citing a French law that would have required a retrial if he was
extradited. Pennsylvania then passed a law promising Einhorn a
retrial. He was re-arrested in September.
	   His defense lawyers argue that, if extradited, Einhorn could
face the death penalty, which is banned under French law. They also
claim Pennsylvania courts might withdraw the pledge of a retrial.
	   In a November interview on ABC television, Einhorn declared his
innocence and claimed the CIA or KGB framed him after he uncovered
classified mind-control experiments.
	   When Maddux, a former cheerleader from Tyler, Texas,
disappeared, Einhorn said she had gone shopping and never returned.
	   But 18 months later, neighbors told police of a stench coming
from Einhorn's apartment, and Maddux's battered remains were found.
Forensic experts said her skull had been smashed six times.

Fundraising for Mitch victims breaks Dutch record
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A national appeal for funds to
help victims of hurricane Mitch raised just over 100 million
guilders (dlrs 53 million), a Dutch record, organizers said
Tuesday.
	   ``I did not expect we would get such a fantastic response,''
said Development Cooperation Minister Eveline Herfkens. A televised
appeal on Nov. 12 raised 50.3 million guilders (dlrs 26.5 million)
and Herfkens said the government would double the amount raised by
the public.
	   The money will be spent by a group of Dutch charities and relief
organizations active in Central American nations devastated a month
ago by Mitch's high winds and torrential rains which left an
estimated 10,000 people dead.

Britain prepares frosty reception for Zimbabwe president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain prepared a frosty reception Tuesday for
visiting Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe _ angered by new moves to
seize white-owned farms, intervention in the Congo's civil war, a
ban on strikes, and his flying to Libya in defiance of a U.N.
embargo.
	   Although Mugabe's visit was billed as private, Foreign Office
Minister Tony Lloyd had asked to see him, officials said.
	   Mugabe, increasingly unpopular in his central African nation,
was due in London later Tuesday from Paris, where he attended a
French-African summit after visiting Libya and Egypt. There was no
official word on his arrival, and the Zimbabwe High Commission, or
embassy, did not return calls.
	   ``There is quite a list of things we would like to raise,'' said
a Foreign Office spokeswoman, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity. ``We are still waiting confirmation of when the meeting
will take place.''
	   Britain has said it is concerned that the Zimbabwe government's
latest plan to acquire compulsorily 841 farms owned by members of
the former central African colony's tiny white minority ran counter
to a pledge in September to hold off on poorly planned
confiscations.
	   Aid donors and international aid organizations are concerned
about disruption of productivity.
	   Zimbabwe also has been harshly criticized internationally for a
land redistribution program marked by delays, mismanagement,
corruption and handing some seized properties to politicians.
	   Despite increasing economic hardship at home, Mugabe has
deployed at huge expense some 8,000 troops to support Congolese
President Laurent Kabila.
	   Mugabe visited Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi Nov. 21, apparently
flying directly to Tripoli in violation of a U.N. flight ban. It
was imposed in 1992 to try to force Libya to hand over for trial
two suspects wanted in the 1988 bombing of an American airliner
over Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   African countries voted in June to ignore the ban.
	   London's Daily Mail newspaper demanded across its front-page
that Britain arrest Mugabe on a litany on charges, including
genocide and tyranny.
	   The pro-conservative tabloid declared that Mugabe warranted the
same fate as Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator who
is under arrest here on a Spanish warrant seeking his extradition
to face charges of genocide and torture during his 1973-90 rule.
	   There would be no possibility of Mugabe being arrested _ all
serving heads of state have total immunity from prosecution under
British law.
	   The newspaper, however, cited Mugabe, 74, to illustrate what it
claimed was ``diplomatic anarchy'' caused by a Nov. 25 ruling by
Britain's highest court, the House of Lords, that as an ex-head of
state Pinochet has no immunity from arrest.
	   The newspaper charged that Mugabe's troops killed up to 20,000
members of the Ndebele ethnic minority after independence from
Britain in 1980, and that he is guilty of corruption, land theft,
and persecuting minorities by fierce verbal attacks on gays and
lesbians and forcing Congo refugees to return home to almost
certain death.
	   ``Both old men have a repellent record,'' the Daily Mail said of
Mugabe and Pinochet.

Ukraine's parliament fails to approve loan deal with World Bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's leftist-dominated parliament on
Tuesday failed to ratify a deal with the World Bank on providing
risk guarantees for foreign creditors.
	   The vote came the same day a delegation from the World bank
arrived in Ukraine to review projects in the former Soviet republic
and discuss new loans for the next 18 months, the bank's Kiev
office said.
	   Lawmakers in the 450-seat parliament voted 167-74 to reject the
five-year agreement, which the government and the World Bank signed
last February, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The deal would have allowed the Cabinet to provide guarantees to
foreign creditors or investors to protect them from possible losses
or other risks linked with political and economic instability.
	   The agreement mostly concerned Ukraine's agricultural sector and
the guarantees were to be backed by a special World Bank fund, with
the annual quota for Ukraine set at dlrs 120 million.
	   Red tape, corruption and the slow pace of reforms have made many
investors wary of Ukraine despite its large size and 51
million-strong population.
	   Parliament's finance committee chairman Valeriy Alioshyn said
the failure to ratify the document stemmed from lawmakers'
``general negative attitude to any deals that have to do with
(foreign) loans,'' according to Interfax.
	   Alioshyn added that many deputies also erroneously linked the
World Bank agreement to the government's earlier practice of
guaranteeing foreign loans for individual Ukrainian companies, many
of which subsequently failed to repay them.
	   While in Ukraine, Paul Siegelbaum, World Bank director for
Ukraine and Belarus, is to meet with President Leonid Kuchma, Prime
Minister Valery Pustovoitenko and other top government officials.
	   The World Bank suspended cooperation with Ukraine in March
following the International Monetary Fund's decision to freeze aid
to Ukraine because of stalled economic reforms.
	   The IMF finally approved a dlrs 2.2 billion loan in September
after the government took steps toward reform, and the World Bank
resumed its cooperation as well, granting dlrs 950 million in loans
for several projects.
	   Ukraine had already received more than dlrs 1.5 billion from the
World Bank since it became a member in 1992.

Gay rights campaigner convicted over church protest, given token
</HEADLINE>
fine &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A gay rights activist was convicted Tuesday of
``indecent behavior in a church'' under a seldom-invoked law and
fined 18.60 pounds (dlrs 30.69) in a token punishment alluding to
the year the law was created.
	   Peter Tatchell, who heads the British gay rights group Outrage,
was arrested under the 1860 Ecclesiastical Courts Jurisdiction Act
after he staged a three-minute protest beneath the pulpit as the
Archbishop of Canterbury, Britain's top cleric, was about to
deliver his Easter Sunday sermon April 12 at Canterbury Cathedral.
	   In front of a congregation of about 1,000 people, , while six of
his fellow protesters held up placards under the pulpit, he had
criticized the archbishop's opposition to lowering the homosexual
age of consent and the church's ban on the ordination of gay
clergy.
	   His case sparked a high-profile campaign to get the law repealed
when free speech activists feared he would face a two month jail
sentence _ the maximum penalty and the sentence handed down when
the law was last used in 1966 when anti-war protesters interrupted
a church service.
	   But Canterbury Stipendiary Magistrate Michael Kelly instead
sentenced Tatchell to the fine, saying he considered the offense
equivalent to a minor public disorder infraction.
	   During the two-day trial, Tatchell had argued that his right to
free speech was guaranteed under human rights laws. But the
magistrate said the same human rights law also provided for the
rights of people to worship.
	   ``You are a man of previous good character and you have a clear
commitment to your cause and a belief in non-violent protest,''
Kelly said.
	   But he admonished Tatchell nonetheless.
	   ``I am sure that some people will have been disgusted and truly
offended by your conduct,'' he said. ``I agree with your counsel
when he said that the Church of England is a robust institution,
and I have no doubt that in spite of the publicity here, your
puerile conduct will soon be forgotten, although your cause may not
be.''
	   ``I think your conduct violated the rights of worshippers on one
of the most important days in the Christian calendar,'' he said.
	   Tatchell said after the trial that he had no regrets ``about
standing up for democracy.''

Chile considering legal action against Pinochet, minister says

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with minister's statement that Chilean gov't
considering legal action against Pinochet &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Chile's foreign minister said Tuesday that
his government is considering legal action against Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, but ruled out a deal guaranteeing he'd stand trial at
home if Britain rejects an extradition request from Spain.
	   ``The government is studying whether to join existing suits,''
the minister, Jose Miguel Insulza, told reporters, referring to
private lawsuits filed this year in Chile against the former
despot.
	   ``The possibility of a trial in Chile exists and gets larger
every day,'' Insulza said to back his argument that trying Pinochet
in Spain for crimes committed during his 1973-1990 dictatorship is
unnecessary.
	   Human rights activists have dismissed this possibility because
Pinochet has wide-ranging immunity at home.
	   But Insulza insisted that Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon's
attempt to extradite Pinochet to Spain on charges of genocide,
terrorism and torture was also an affront to Chilean sovereignty
and its transition to democracy.
	   A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared at the hands of the police after Pinochet seized power
in a military coup that toppled democratically elected Marxist
President Salvador Allende.
	   Chile, Insulza said, was ``under no obligation'' to promise that
the 83-year-old retired general would stand trial if allowed home
from London where he has been under police guard pending possible
extradition since being detained on Oct. 16 while recuperating from
back surgery.
	   According to Insulza, sent to press for Pinochet's release,
Chile should be allowed to deal with the legacy of general's 17
years in power without interference.
	   ``There is no reason to call into doubt the solidity of
democracy in Chile or our capacity to resolve our own problems,''
Insulza said, after stressing that the affair had triggered
``polarization, break down of dialogue and sharp political
confrontation.''
	   Insulza was speaking after talks with his Spanish counterpart
Abel Matutes.
	   Earlier Tuesday he met with Supreme Court Deputy President Luis
Lopez and Senate President Juan Ignacio Barrero, and was due to
meet Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar later in the day.
	   Matutes expressed sympathy for Chilean government concerns, but
insisted that the Spanish government was powerless to act, as all
remaining decisions on Pinochet's fate were in British hands.
	   Prior to arriving in Madrid Monday, Insulza spent four days
lobbying the British government whose Home Secretary, Jack Straw,
has until Dec. 11 to decide whether to allow extradition
proceedings to go ahead.
	   Insulza said his trip had produced ``some positive indications''
but he declined to give details.

Yeltsin sends greeting to Mideast conference
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin promised Russia's economic
help to Palestinians in a message to a Mideast donors' conference
in Washington, the Kremlin said Tuesday.
	   The United States and 42 other nations promised more than dlrs 3
billion to help alleviate Palestinian poverty during the donor
conference that ended Monday. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said
he was satisfied with the offers and confident the pledges would be
fulfilled _ and then resumed verbal attacks against Israel.
	   Yeltsin said his cash-starved country would make its donation by
continuing to train Palestinian specialists and expanding trade and
economic cooperation, in line with an agreement signed during
Arafat's visit to Moscow last month.
	   ``Russia, as a co-sponsor of the Mideast peace process, will
continue making an active contribution to ensuring progress in the
Palestinian direction of an Arab-Israeli settlement, including
contribution to the social and economic growth of Palestinian
territories,'' Yeltsin's letter said.
	   Yeltsin also sent a separate message to U.S. President Bill
Clinton saying that ``help to economic and social development of
Palestinians' self-government is undoubtedly a significant factor
supporting peace talks.''
	   Russia is officially a co-sponsor of the peace process launched
in Madrid, Spain, in 1991. But the United States has played a far
greater role.
	   Yeltsin also called for joint international efforts to settle
the conflict.
	   ``Today as never before joint efforts are needed to cement the
positive changes and fulfill the agreements that have been
reached,'' Yeltsin's message read.

German foreign minister to visit U.S., Canada
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine
said Tuesday he will seek approval from Canada and the United
States for having European common currency nations represented at
Group of Seven meetings.
	   Lafontaine, who leaves Thursday for a two-day trip to North
America, said the 11 countries adopting the euro common currency on
Jan. 1 should be represented by the finance minister of whichever
country holds the rotating European Union presidency.
	   As Germany assumes the six-month presidency Jan. 1, Lafontaine
himself would be the first European currency zone representative,
if his plan is approved.
	   Lafontaine is to arrive Thursday in Canada for a meeting with
Finance Minister Paul Martin in Ottawa before traveling to
Washington.
	   On Friday, he is to meet separately with U.S. Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Michael
Camdessus and U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
	   His trip to North America, part of a series of introductory
visits since taking office on Oct. 27, will mean the finance
minister has visited all of the Group of Seven Leading
Industrialized Nations except Japan.

Italian club negotiating takeover of French team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ AS Roma, the Italian first division soccer club, is
close to taking over France's second division team Nice in an
effort to expand the growth of young talents.
	   A spokesman for the Roman club, which is owned by Italian
industrialist Francesco Sensi, said Tuesday that negotiations with
Nice had entered the final stage.
	   ``But the formal, final agreement has not yet been reached,''
the spokesman said.
	   Club officials said the control of the French team was intended
to grant Roma the possibility to fish for young players in France
and in other countries.
	   ``Nice would be a sort of breeding-ground for young players and
for those players Roma can't immediately field,'' the spokesman
explained.
	   Roma is currently second to Fiorentina in the Italian League
standings while Nice is the last-place in the 20-team French second
division.

EU, NKorea to hold first-ever talks on wide range of issues
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with EU unable to name NKorean officials, motivation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union and North Korea
officials will hold first-ever talks here Wednesday on issues
ranging from human rights to food aid to security on the Korean
peninsula.
	   ``We are quite pleased North Korea has agreed to debate a broad
agenda of issues,'' EU spokesman Nigel Gardner said Tuesday.
	   He said the EU wants to see if the Europeans can have a regular,
political dialogue with North Korea, a hard-line communist nation
living in near-isolation from the rest of the world.
	   The EU side will include mid-level officials from Austria,
Britain and Germany and Percy Westerlund, a Swede who is director
general at the European Commission's foreign affairs office.
	   Gardner would not speculate as to why North Korea had agreed to
talks here and could not give a list of North Korean participants.
	   He said the discussion will also touch on efforts by Japan,
South Korea, the United States and the EU to build two nuclear
reactors replacing North Korea's own nuclear program that was
suspected of developing atomic weapons.
	   They formed a consortium in 1994, known as the Korean Peninsula
Energy Development Organization, that recently approved a new dlrs
4.6 billion estimate for the two reactors.
	   KEDO was created after North Korea agreed to freeze and
eventually dismantle its nuclear weapons program in exchange for
two light-water nuclear power plants and 500,000-ton annual fuel
oil shipments until they are completed.
	   The reactors are due to be ready for use by 2003 and will
replace North Korea's Soviet-developed graphite-moderated reactors
that produce greater amounts of weapons-grade plutonium.
	   The goal of controlling nuclear proliferation has taken on new
urgency since India and Pakistan conducted nuclear test explosions
in May, raising international concern the entire system of
international nuclear controls might unravel.

U.N. genocide trial continues for Bosnian Serb killer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A genocide suspect who called
himself the ``Serb Adolf'' seemed to enjoy murdering and torturing
hundreds of Muslim prisoners of war, a witness testified Tuesday at
a U.N. trial.
	   Goran Jelisic, a 30-year-old mechanic who has already confessed
to murdering 12 Muslims and Croats, is being tried for genocide,
the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal's most severe charge. He committed
the murders and beatings while working in a detention camp near the
northern Bosnian town of Brcko in 1992.
	   ``I think he took pleasure in doing this because he was so
powerful,'' said a 53-year-old Muslim camp survivor identified only
as Witness B. ``He said it was nice to kill.''
	   Witness B said he was taken to the Luka detention camp with two
busloads of Muslims. He said Jelisic, a Bosnian Serb, immediately
took all of their identification papers and personal belongings.
	   ``He introduced himself and said, `My name is Goran Jelisic,
known as Adolf. You will get to know me well,''' Witness B said on
the second day of Jelisic's genocide trial.
	   Jelisic called out some of the names from the identification
papers and said the people called would be executed, then laughed
and said he was only joking, the witness testified.
	   He recounted how Jelisic interrogated two detainees who were not
residents of Brcko. When they told him they were visiting relatives
for May Day, he accused them of lying, Witness B said.
	   ``He said, `This will by your last May Day,' and took them out
and killed them,'' the witness said.
	   Earlier in the day, another witness _ also a Muslim _ continued
his testimony from Monday, detailing how Jelisic allegedly brutally
shot Muslims by holding their heads over a grate.
	   Jelisic and other camp guards tortured and killed people at
will, Witness A said, calling Jelisic ``a beast.''
	   ``They simply knew we were Muslims and Croats. They simply
wanted to eradicate us,'' said Witness A, who had to take a short
break when he began to sob on the stand.
	   ``I think this was killing of pleasure, out of some kind of hate
against my people. Those of us that survived... we all believe he
tried to inflict as much pain as possible,'' he said.
	   During the testimony, Jelisic sat calmly, alternately leaning
forward on the table in front of him or slumping in his chair.
	   By trying him for genocide, U.N. prosecutors will be able to
call evidence about the background of Jelisic's murders, including
the involvement of more senior Serbs.
	   Jelisic will be convicted of the 12 murders he confessed to and
sentenced at the end of his trial, which is expected to last well
into 1999. He faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for
each offense.
	   Set up in 1993 by the U.N. Security Council, the tribunal has
convicted two Muslims, two Bosnian Croats and a Bosnian Serb of war
crimes including murder, rape and torture, but it has yet to
register a genocide conviction.

 &UR; Bosnians receiving first shipment of new coins

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A shipment of nine million
newly minted coins reached Bosnia Tuesday to replace chewing gum
and chocolate bars as the country's loose change.
	   The coins, hot from London's Royal Mint, are the first to reach
Bosnia since the summer when the country introduced a new currency,
theKonvertibilna Marka. The currency, valued at one German Mark
(dlrs 0.63) was issued only in bank notes until now.
	   Due to the lack of coinage, Bosnian shops use chewing gum as
ersatz 10 Fening coins and small chocolate bars to replace coins of
20 Fenings. There are 100 Fenings to the Marka.
	   ``We will waste no time in putting the coins into circulation
... so that people can feel them jingling in their pockets,'' said
Peter Nicholl, the governor of Bosnia's Central Bank. ``A sound
that symbolizes a solid future, built on a sound currency.''
	   The first coin shipment totals 936,000 Konvertibilna Marka.
	   The 10, 20 and 50 Fening coins are to be put into general
circulation in December.
	   While shops had given chewing gum and chocolate bars as small
change, they refused to accept them as payment for goods. Many
customers are left with large candy stashes.
	   Bosnia's market used four different currencies up until this
summer when the Kovertibilna Marka was launched. The Bosnian Serbs
used the Yugoslav Dinar, the Bosnian Croats the Croatian Kuna and
the central Muslim-dominated parts their own money. The German Mark
remains accepted everywhere.

Suicide bomb kills one, injures nine in Turkey

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with governor saying it was suicide attack, hand
grenade used, soldier among injured &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DIYARBAKIR, Turkey (AP) _ An 18-year-old woman set off a hand
grenade strapped to her body Tuesday in a busy shopping street,
killing herself and injuring nine people, said the governor of this
province in the heart of the 14-year-old Kurdish war for autonomy.
	   Nafiz Kayali, governor of Diyarbakir province, refused to say
whether the woman was a Kurdish rebel, Anatolia, a Turkish news
agency reported.
	   Female Kurdish militants have in the past carried out suicide
bomb attacks in Turkey.
	   The blast occurred in the town of Lice, in southeastern Turkey.
	   Private television NTV reported that one of the injured was a
soldier.
	   The attack could discredit claims by rebel Kurdish leader,
Abdullah Ocalan, who was detained in Rome last month, that the
group is renouncing violence in the struggle for autonomy for
Kurds.
	   Last month, a Kurdish woman died setting off a bomb near a
military garrison that wounded two others.
	   Close to 37,000 people have been killed since Ocalan's group
began fighting in 1984.

 &UR; Eds: REPEATING to CORRECT slugline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Juventus top manager Luciano Moggi on
Tuesday defended as ``well grounded'' the club decision to stay a
single day in Istanbul for the politically tinged Champions League
match against Turkey's Galatasaray.
	   The Italian league champions, who need a victory against the
Turkish team to keep qualifying chances alive in the most titled
European soccer competition, decided to travel to Istanbul on the
match day Wednesday and return home immediately after the game.
	   UEFA, Europe's soccer governing body which requires teams to
arrive the day before of European Cup matches, was critical of
Juventus decision.
	   ``Juventus feels there are well grounded motives for failing to
conform to UEFA directives,'' said Moggi, the general director of
the Turin team which is owned by the Agnelli family of auto
tycoons.
	   Juventus confirmed on Tuesday its travel plans for the match
already postponed by one week after Italy's refusal to extradite a
Kurdish rebel leader prompted anti-Italian demonstrations in
Turkey.
	   Several Juventus players, who had initially refused to travel to
Instanbul, bowed to the club decision to play Galatasaray but
criticized the UEFA stand.
	   ``We have been forced to play a game conditioned by political
motives,'' said No.1 keeper Angelo Peruzzi.
	   Team captain Antonio Conte said Tuesday that the Italian
government and UEFA left the Italian team alone.
	   ``UEFA and the (Italian) government have claimed that there are
no secutiry problems in Istanbul ... but as far as we know no UEFA
and government representatives will be in Istanbul Wednesday,''
Conte told the Italian news agency ANSA.
	   Italian culture minister Giovanna Malendri, invited to attend
the game by her Turkish counterpart, said Tuesday she had not yet
taken a final decision about traveling to Istanbul.

Runaway reindeer ends weeklong escapade at lasso's end

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Rudolph the real reindeer wasn't as
eager to please as the one in the song, causing havoc for a week in
the outlying regions of the Finnish capital.
	   The six-year-old Rudolph was brought last month from central
Finland to Sotunki, outside Helsinki, where he was to entertain
children and give sled rides.
	   But on Nov. 22, he fled his enclosure, apparently spooked by a
galloping horse, and plunged into the woods. Farmers reported
several sightings, and motorists sometimes had to swerve to avoid
the renegade reindeer.
	   With the help of vigilant reindeer-spotters, Rudolph was nabbed
by his previous owner who came south and tracked him down, the
Ilta-Sanomat newspaper said Tuesday.
	   There are an estimated 200,000 reindeer in Finland, bred mainly
by the Samis in Lapland, northern Finland. They are tame, unlike in
neighboring Norway and Sweden where there are also herds of wild
reindeer.

Pakistan raises sales tax to fulfill key IMF condition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Cash-starved Pakistan on Tuesday
raised the general sales tax from 12.5 percent to 15 percent in a
bid to boost revenues and meet a key condition for loans from the
International Monetary Fund.
	   According to a law passed by President Rafiq Tarar,
``circumstances exist which render it necessary to take immediate
action.''
	   A finance ministry official said the general sales tax increase
was promised by the government last week during meetings with the
IMF.
	   The meetings resulted in a dlrs 5.5 billion bailout package for
Pakistan.
	   ``The raise in general sales tax is one of the many up-front
measures which the government has to take before the IMF board
meets to give a final nod to a bailout package for Pakistan,'' said
the ministry official, who spoke on condition that his name not be
mentioned.
	   Apart from increasing the sales tax, the IMF also is seeking an
agricultural tax, revamped tax system, structural reforms in the
public sector, the recovery of billions of rupees in outstanding
loans and unpaid utility bills, the official said.
	   The IMF package will have to be approved by the IMF board later
this month before taking effect.
	   Without the bailout package, Pakistan will surely default on its
whopping debt of dlrs 32 billion.
	   Haneef Janoo, former president of the Karachi Chamber of
Commerce and Industries, said the tax hike will hit the poor the
hardest and encourage tax evasion, in a country where barely one
million people pay taxes.
	   ``The government is sticking to the same old policy of raising
taxes to increase revenues which will result in more tax evasion in
the absence of effective system of checks and balances,'' he said.
	   But Nadeem Naqvi, chief analyst of the International Asset
Management Company, a financial adviser to international investment
funds, said the tax increase shows that the government is seriously
focusing on the revenue generation commitments made with the global
donors.
	   ``There will be some opposition and protest from the business
community, but given the lack of alternatives, the government has
no choice other than to implement its decision,'' he told The
Associated Press.
	   Chairman of the Karachi Stock Exchange, Yaseen Lakhani, said the
government should not be soft on the issue of tax collection.
	   ``The government should be tough with those who don't want to
pay taxes,'' he said.

Turkish premier says Germany or Italy should try Kurdish rebel
</HEADLINE>
leader &QL; 
 &UR; EDS: ADDS Italian lower house to debate dilemma &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on
Tuesday said that Italy or Germany should try a Kurdish rebel
leader detained in Rome if Turkey's extradition bid fails.
	   Speaking to members of his center-right party in Parliament,
Yilmaz said that if Italy refuses to hand over rebel Kurdish leader
Abdullah Ocalan, ``the least you can do is to make sure that his
crimes do not remain unpunished.''
	   Turkey wants Ocalan extradited, but Italy refuses to hand him
over since Italian law forbids forbid extradition to countries,
like Turkey, where suspects may face the death penalty.
	   Ocalan is also wanted in Germany, but German officials, fearing
trouble among its Kurdish and Turkish immigrant population, say
they will not seek his extradition.
	   ``You issue a warrant for crimes committed on your territory ...
but then you shy away from trying him,'' Yilmaz dded, in a clear
reference to Germany. ``What kind of a legal state is this?''
	   Turkey has been angered by a proposal by the prime ministers of
Germany and Italy for an international tribunal to try Ocalan,
which Ankara accuses of terrorism.
	   The PKK has been fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast
since 1984 in a war that has killed 37,000 people.
	   Turkey's approximately 12 million Kurds are not recognized as an
official minority and are denied education and broadcasting rights.
	   In Rome, the Chamber of Deputies, Parliament's lower house,
scheduled a debate on the Ocalan dilemma for early Wednesday
evening, following a speech on the issue by leftist Premier Massimo
D'Alema.

Tensions rise over Palestinian prisoners, Jewish settlements
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A senior Palestinian official on Tuesday
appealed to U.S. President Bill Clinton to resolve growing tensions
over Israel's refusal to release jailed anti-Israel activists.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he could not
release prisoners who had been involved in attacks on Israelis. ``I
will not back down on this,'' he vowed.
	   The issue, which has prompted clashes between stone-throwing
Palestinian youths and Israeli soldiers, is raising concern about
an outbreak of violence in advance of Clinton's Dec. 12-15 visit to
Israel and the Palestinian-ruled lands.
	   The Israeli daily Haaretz reported that Israeli security
officials had urged Netanyahu to agree to free more Palestinian
activists in order to prevent rioting.
	   Palestinians claim that Israel promised at the Wye River summit
last month to free 750 prisoners from political factions such as
Yasser Arafat's Fatah group. Israel released 250 prisoners last
month, but most were car thieves and petty crooks.
	   ``This deception is creating demonstrations, anger and
frustration in the Palestinian community,'' Ahmed Tibi, an adviser
to Arafat, told a Foreign Press Association news conference.
	   Demonstrations have been held almost daily in support of
Palestinian prisoners, with some of the anger turned on Yasser
Arafat and his government.
	   On Tuesday, protests were held in the West Bank town of Ramallah
where several hundred demonstrators gathered and in the Gaza Strip,
where about 150 children called for the release of their fathers.
	   ``How can we live without our fathers?'' said Fidda Washah, 16,
who addressed the rally. Her father, Jabar, a member of the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine faction, has served 14 years
of a life sentence for attacking Israeli soldiers.
	   Netanyahu said he would not release anyone ``with blood on their
hands'' or members of the Islamic militant group Hamas.
	   ``The Palestinians are claiming, falsely, that I suggested
somehow to free murders at Wye,'' Netanyahu told reporters.
	   Israeli officials say only about 110 of the 2,500 Palestinian
activists behind bars could be let go in the next release,
scheduled to take place just after Clinton's visit.
	   Tibi, who was spokesman for the Palestinian delegation at Wye
Mills, Md., said only about 300 of the Palestinians currently in
jail had been involved in attacks that killed Israelis. The rest he
described as ``political prisoners.''
	   He said about 1,250 prisoners who were members of various PLO
factions and the remainder belonged to Hamas.
	   ``We would very much like him (Clinton) to interfere in the
issue of Palestinian prisoners,'' said Tibi.
	   David Bar-Illan, a senior adviser to Netanyahu, said Israel
would not agree to loosen the definition and free Palestinians
involved in attacks that only injured Israelis.
	   ``We will not budge on this one,'' Bar-Illan said, adding Israel
had freed more than 7,000 prisoners over the past five years.
	   Palestinian officials called on residents of the West Bank to
confront Israeli bulldozers that are expanding settlements or
building roads to link Israeli-controlled areas of the West Bank
and Israel.
	   ``Settlement activity should be resisted,'' said Tibi.
``Settlers are public enemy No. 1 to Palestinians.''
	   Several members of the Palestinian legislative council are
considering a boycott of Clinton's speech in Gaza City on Dec. 14
to show their anger over a failure by the United States to pressure
Israel on the settlement and prisoner issues.
	   In traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, meanwhile, Israeli
contractors bidding on the Har Homa Jewish housing project in
visited the construction site where left-wing Israelis staged a
protest. Police detained three demonstrators from the Peace Now
group trying to disrupt the tour.
	   The Palestinians hope to establish a future capital in east
Jerusalem. They say Har Homa is part of an Israeli plan to cut off
the Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem from their hinterland in
Bethlehem and the southern West Bank.

Matt Perry ruled out of Saturday's Test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England full-back Matt Perry has been ruled out of
Saturday's rugby union Test against South Africa at Twickenham.
	   Perry suffered a concussion during last weekend's defeat against
Australia and will be sidelined for three weeks, England coach
Clive Woodward said Tuesday.
	   With Paul Grayson and Will Greenwood still questionable with
injuries, Woodward called up David Rees and Alex King into the
squad to provide cover at wing and fly-half.
	   Perry was injured in the final seconds of the 12-11 defeat
against the Wallabies at Twickenham. Doctors said he should take
off at least three weeks.
	   Grayson, who limped off with a knee injury against the Aussies,
and center Greenwood, who failed to make the match, are still under
treatment.
	   Woodward drafted King into his squad as stand-by for Grayson.
Rees is likely to take Austin Healey's place in the wing.
	   Woodward did not call up an immediate replacement for Perry.
It's expected that Mike Catt, Grayson's replacement at fly-half
against Australia, will fill the full-back role.
	   The South Africa Springboks will set a world record of 18
consecutive Test victories if they beat England on Saturday. They
would eclipse the New Zealand All Blacks' 17-match winning streak
between 1965 and 1969.
	   ``I don't see any country going through a winning run of 17 or
18 Tests in the future,'' Springboks coach Nick Mallett said.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Marking World AIDS Day, Indian
prostitutes offered Tuesday to help their government fight the
disease that has infected more people in India than in any other.
	   An estimated 3 million to 5 million of India's 1 billion people
carry HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, according to UNAIDS.
	   Former male prostitute R. Meera, who runs a program to
distribute condoms to brothel customers in the southern Andhra
Pradesh state urged the government to sponsor more programs like
his.
	   At a news conference called by sex workers from across India who
had gathered in New Delhi, Meera said his close links with the sex
industry helped him break communication barriers.
	   Other prostitutes said the government should start more
education programs about safe sex in red light districts. Sadhana
Mukherjee, secretary of the Distressed Women's Cooperative
Association, a network of female sex workers, said prostitutes were
risking their lives by having sex without condoms, as customers
frequently demand.
	   HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is transmitted in body fluids
such as semen and blood.
	   Also Tuesday, several hundred school children, adult AIDS
activists and prostitutes marched through New Delhi on Tuesday
shouting AIDS awareness slogans and waving banners declaring
``Together Against AIDS.''
	   They were joined by Jacqueline Lundquist, wife of U.S.
Ambassador Richard Celeste, wearing a white T-shirt emblazoned with
the familiar AIDS awareness logo of a loop of red ribbon. Lundquist
led the marchers in a call-and-response: ``What do we want? AIDS
awareness! When do we want it? Now!''
	   ``It's extraordinarily important that everyone get involved in
the AIDS awareness campaign, but particularly young people, because
this is the next generation,'' Lundquist said.
	   Several national newspapers devoted space to World AIDS Day. The
Pioneer newspaper ran its own quarter-page ad admonishing readers
to ``be good in bed'' _ with condoms forming the Os, a fairly racy
display in traditional India.

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Christmas in Cuba is back for good.
	   The Communist Party used the entire front page of Cuba's only
daily newspaper, Granma, on Tuesday to recommend that ``from this
year on,'' Dec. 25 should be a be holiday in Cuba, formally
re-establishing a custom abolished in 1969.
	   The proposal is sure to be adopted by the Communist country's
government.
	   The government granted a Christmas holiday last year as a
one-time favor to Pope John Paul II, who visited in January. But at
the time it balked at declaring the measure permanent.
	   Cuba abolished the Christmas holiday in 1969, saying it
interfered with the mobilization of manpower for the sugar harvest.
	   The party declaration insisted that the abolition of the holiday
was not inspired by any anti-religious sentiment.

Russian prime minister lobbies IMF chief for more loans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in top 3 grafs with talks with Primakov under way,
Camdessus quote. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With Russia's leaders urgently seeking financial
help, International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus began two
days of talks in Moscow on Tuesday on Russia's frozen loan
agreement with the IMF.
	   Camdessus met Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov later Tuesday and
is scheduled to hold broader talks with government officials
Wednesday.
	   ``I want to get better acquainted with the prime minister,''
Camdessus told reporters upon arrival in Moscow on Tuesday night.
``I presume we will be having interesting conversations.''
	   President Boris Yeltsin, who is in the hospital receiving
treatment for pneumonia, on Tuesday spoke with Primakov by
telephone to discuss the government's stance at the talks with
Camdessus.
	   Russia is seeking further installments on an IMF bailout package
that was reached in the summer, but was frozen after the government
devalued the ruble and defaulted on some of its debts in August.
The IMF has said the government must come up with a realistic
recovery plan before more money will be released.
	   Camdessus is not expected to announce any breakthroughs, but his
visit does give Russia an opportunity to make its case and lobby
for fresh funds.
	   The bailout package totals dlrs 22.6 billion and also involves
the World Bank and the Japanese government, but Russia has so far
received only about dlrs 5 billion.
	   An IMF mission left town last week saying the government's
revenue forecast for next year was overly optimistic. It also
disapproved of the government's intention to lower taxes and offer
subsidies to ailing industries.
	   ``The IMF has plenty of reasons to say (to Russia), `you guys
want to borrow money from us while cutting taxes without having
learned how to collect them,''' the liberal daily Vremya said
Tuesday.
	   If the Russian government doesn't receive foreign help soon, it
will probably have to start printing money, which would drive up
inflation.
	   ``I hope that the IMF would be able to make a decision to
provide aid to Russia that would allow us to avoid
hyperinflation,'' Oleg Sysuyev, a top presidential aide, was quoted
as saying Tuesday by the Interfax news agency.
	   The government has been delaying a debate on next year's budget
as it struggles to find ways to come up with enough money to meet
its expenses. The Cabinet again delayed the discussion this week,
but insisted the delay was not connected with Camdessus' visit.
	   However, the Russian media claimed the government put off action
on the budget because it is still hoping for the IMF loans.
	   ``Everyone understands that budget parameters remain vague, and
their clarification depends on Camdessus' visit,'' the business
daily Kommersant said Tuesday.
	   Former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, who was on a trip to the
United States this week, said Russia wouldn't be able to pay dlrs
17.5 billion in foreign debt that comes due next year.
	   ``The IMF must realize that and accept compromises with Russia
in reaching agreements on restructuring foreign debts,'' Kiriyenko
said at New York University on Monday, according to the Interfax
news agency.

Russian foreign minister says Baltics still must do more for
</HEADLINE>
minorities &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Despite progress in integrating ethnic
Russians and other minorities in the Baltics, the Kremlin still
considers the work insufficient, Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said Tuesday.
	   Ivanov said he will take up the issue in detail at the meeting
of foreign ministers of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe that begins Wednesday in Oslo, Norway.
	   Kremlin complaints about the threatment of ethnic Russians in
Latvia and Estonia, where many of them have been without
citizenship since the collapse of the Soviet Union, has long been
an irritant in the countries' relations and Russia this spring
threatened trade sanctions against Latvia over the issue.
	   The OSCE has pushed Estonia and Latvia to improve the groups'
standing. In October, Latvian voters approved new laws removing
some of the obstacles to ethnic Russians seeking naturalization.
	   ''We consider that certain steps have been taken to fulfill the
OSCE's recommendations, but they are not enough,'' Ivanov said at a
news conference after meeting with Prime Minister Goeran Persson
and Foreign Minister Anna Lindh.
	   Russia believes that in the Baltics ''one should apply exactly
the same standard of rights as in the rest of Europe -- not more,
not less,'' Ivanov said.
	   Ivanov also said he presented figures to Persson and Lindh
showing that Russia is following up on the promise that President
Boris Yeltsin made a year ago in Stockholm to reduce its military
strength in the northwest by about 40 percent.

Helicopter rescues TV crew trapped on Arctic island
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS, UPDATES with details, quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Amid snow squalls whipping across a desolate
Arctic landscape, a Russian helicopter emerged from the dusky
winter light Tuesday and rescued a TV crew stranded on a remote
island for weeks by bad weather.
	   The three-man crew _ a Russian, a Japanese and an Australian who
had been making a documentary on polar bears _ had three days'
worth of food left when the helicopter airlifted them from Wrangel
Island to the port of Pevek, the Ministry of Emergency Situations
said.
	   They had waited for weeks for the skies to clear up enough so
that a helicopter could land.
	   ``On Oct. 15 we completed the work, and a flight was ordered to
take us back,'' researcher Nikita Ovsyannikov told the Russian
television channel NTV.
	   ``But this year the weather conditions were very unusual: heavy,
long cyclones, the weather was constantly bad, with powerful
blizzards. So the flight couldn't arrive.''
	   The rescue helicopter lifted off from Pevek at 11:30 a.m. local
time (2330 Monday GMT) _ the height of the Arctic day that never
gets brighter than twilight.
	   The temperature on Wrangel Island has been around minus 30 C
(minus 22 F).
	   Russia's Arctic has been particularly severe this year. A
nuclear-powered ice breaking ship was stranded for several days
last week, unable to cut a channel for a Finnish tanker that
carried badly needed fuel to residents of Russia's northeast
Chukotka peninsula, not far from Wrangel Island.
	   ``It wasn't easy to find pilots,'' said Dean Finlay of the
international emergency company AEA International SOS. ``Also,
there was only a three-hour daytime window in the area, and just
over two hours of flight time, so they had to get the window just
right.''
	   It took the crew about an hour to load the 400 kilograms (880
pounds) of equipment and film aboard. Then they traveled back in
the already black Arctic night.
	   ``It was an anxious couple of hours,'' said John Hyde, a
television producer who helped coordinate the rescue.
	   The Japanese crew member, Tatsuhiko Kobayashi, developed
complications from a recent eye operation, but the others were in
good health, Russia's ORT television reported.
	   There were conflicting reports on who organized the rescue.
Emergency Situations Ministry spokesman Viktor Beltsov said the
rescue was organized by his agency using an Mi-8 helicopter hired
from a private airline.
	   But AEA International SOS said it had organized the rescue,
according to Mark Crawford, the company's spokesman in Australia.
He said his company had been hired by the filmmakers' employer,
Natural History Pty. Ltd., in New Zealand.
	   ``They're in fair spirits,'' Crawford said of the crew.
``They're surviving, of course, but they were down to their last
three days of food.''
	   The film crew arrived on Wrangel Island on Sept. 2 and intended
to leave Oct. 15. As flights were delayed by bad weather, the three
were holed up in a cabin on the island's northeast coast, about 550
kilometers (350 miles) west of Alaska.
	   Kobayashi is an employee of NHK, the Japanese television
company. The Australian is cameraman John McGuiness. They and
Ovsyannikov were expected to fly to Moscow on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
	   POTSDAM, Germany (AP) _ Germany and France proposed broad new
priorities for Europe on Tuesday reflecting the left's influence on
the political mood: a governmental push to create jobs and better
regulation of financial markets.
	   Leading his first summit since taking office, German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder's center-left politics breathed new life into
French-German relations. The ties, strong when both nations were
run by conservatives, had stagnated after France's government
turned left under Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
	   Schroeder spoke of ``a new dynamic'' between Europe's two
closest partners and biggest nations, now back in synch under
left-leaning governments since his election in September. Just as
Chancellor Helmut Kohl emphasized his personal friendship with
Francois Mitterrand, Schroeder and French President Jacques Chirac
displayed an obvious liking for each other.
	   The German and French leaders agreed Tuesday to make a new push
to give the European Union military capability of its own parallel
to NATO, a project dear to the French and recently supported by
Britain.
	   But jobs were the focus of the summit as the two nations renewed
their role as the engine behind efforts to turn Europe into an
economic superpower. Unemployment in the 11 countries launching
Europe's single currency, the euro, on Jan. 1 is a stubborn 10.9
percent, and putting people back to work has been a dominant
political theme among European leaders.
	   ``We want to make a great common effort to move the theme of
employment to the center of European politics,'' Schroeder, a
center-left Social Democrat, told a news conference with Chirac and
Jospin.
	   In a joint declaration, the leaders said a jobs creation pact is
needed to offset government austerity pledges designed to bolster
the euro. European governments should set binding targets for
putting their citizens back to work, the declaration said.
	   With the euro tying 11 European economies closer together than
ever before, the leaders also pledged to make workers' rights a
greater focus in the European Union.
	   Taking their cue from a campaign by Germany's leftist finance
minister, Oskar Lafontaine, they called for tighter financial
regulation internationally to counter economically damaging swings
in the markets.
	   The proposals were a departure from the Kohl era, when Germany
resisted calls for a common European fight against joblessness.
	   Despite the warmth among the leaders and the common vision for
guiding Europe toward the single currency and EU expansion, there
also was discord at the summit.
	   Both governments said they would study the impact of Germany's
pledge to abolish nuclear power. France, which has no such plans,
does lucrative business reprocessing nuclear fuel from German power
plants.
	   Both sides agreed to push plans to merge European aerospace
industries to take on U.S. giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin,
though they didn't resolve the issue of whether the French would
immediately participate. Schroeder said he supports German and
British aerospace firms in their efforts to merge even if the
French only join later.

Honduras lowers Mitch death toll
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Honduras has lowered the official
death toll from Hurricane Mitch by 1,350 and suspended a governor
after investigators couldn't verify the hundreds of deaths she
reported in her remote northwestern area.
	   The new death toll of 5,657 was compiled after the government
sent teams to verify reports from regions across Honduras.
	   Aid workers and journalists began questioning Honduras'
estimated death toll after figures jumped drastically Nov. 2, the
same day that news broke of a landslide in Nicaragua that covered
two villages and killed up to 2,000 people.
	   That day, Honduras' official death toll jumped from 600 to
5,000. Later, authorities raised the figure to 6,400, then to
7,007.
	   Federal authorities announced Tuesday that they had suspended
Gov. Lucila Esperanza Barahona de Castro of the Santa Barbara
department near the Guatemala border after investigators could
verify only 282 of the 1,159 deaths reported in her area.
	   Authorities cited by the newspaper El Heraldo said the
suspension was standard procedure during an inquiry. Barahona could
not be reached immediately for comment.
	   In addition to the 5,657 dead, Honduras said it had verified
8,058 missing, 12,272 injured and 1.4 million homeless throughout
the country.

Benetton opens state-of-art wind tunnel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ENSTONE, England (AP) _ Benetton, with only one Formula One
victory in the last three seasons, opened a 12 million-pound (dlrs
20 million) wind tunnel Tuesday.
	   The state-of-the-art facility will produce wind speeds of 150
mph (240 kph), and under pressure simulate wind speeds of 300 mph
(480 kph). It will be used to test the car's aerodynamic
characteristics under race conditions.
	   ``We are extremely proud that the technology involved in the
wind tunnel is the most advanced in the Formula One world,'' said
Rocco Benetton, chief executive of Benetton.
	   ``This is probably the biggest single technological investment
in the Formula One industry and certainly the largest ever
investment made by Benetton Group in motor racing.
	   ``We now have a unique tool that is second to none,'' he added.
	   Benetton's only win in the last three seasons was Gerhard
Berger's victory at Hockenheim in Germany in 1997.
	   Italy's Giancarlo Fisichella and Austria's Alexander Wurz drove
for Benetton this season and will be back in 1999.
	   The new building is located on 1,250 square meters next to the
Italian team factory in Enstone, about 15 miles (25 miles) north of
Oxford.

Euro-zone nations break deadlock over international representation

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ With just a month to go before the
launch of the euro, European Union finance ministers reached an
11th-hour agreement Tuesday on who should speak for the
single-currency bloc on the world stage.
	   The agreement resolved months of deadlock between big and small
euro-zone nations over representation of the 11-nation currency
bloc at the G-7 group of world economic powers and other
international bodies.
	   Under the compromise, the euro-zone's three existing G-7 nations
- Germany, France and Italy - keep their seats and will take turns
to represent the bloc. Smaller nations will get to sit alongside
them at G-7 meetings, when they hold the rotating euro-zone
presidency.
	   German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine will therefore speak
for the euro-zone for the first six months of 1999, to be joined by
his Finnish counterpart Sauli Niniisto for second half of the year.
	   Wim Duisenberg, president of the new European Central Bank, will
get a G-7 seat. But the EU's executive Commission will offered only
a ``technical support'' role.
	   The launch of the euro as the shared currency of 11 EU nations
on Jan. 1 will create a single bloc that will rival the United
States and Japan as a global economic power.
	   But while U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Japanese
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa can always get on the phone to
discuss the world economic situation, nobody was sure whom to call
when they want to speak to the euro-bloc.
	   The rotating system of euro-zone presidencies should go some way
to meeting that need. The deal is set to be confirmed by EU leaders
at their year-end summit next week in Vienna. Details of how the
euro-zone will be represented at the International Monetary Fund
and other world bodies are also expected to be finalized in the
Austrian capital.
	   There was no immediate reaction from other G-7 nations - the
United States, Japan and Canada _ who must agree to the proposal.
Lafontaine is scheduled to present the proposal at a meeting Friday
with Rubin and U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
Friday in Washington.
	   ``It was very important that we defined the rules before the end
of the year,'' said French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn.
``I think the Americans will go along with it.''
	   If accepted, the new system will be applied at a G-7 finance
ministers and central bankers meeting Feb. 20 in Bonn, Germany.
Britain, the EU's fourth G-7 member, is staying out of the euro.
	   The EU ministers also called for an acceleration of efforts to
close corporate tax loopholes that cost national treasuries
billions of dollars in lost revenue. But differences remained over
talk of a wider harmonization of tax policies.
	   Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown repeated
British opposition to French and German suggestions of EU-wide tax
levels. ``There is no reason why the single currency should mean
the same tax rates across Europe,'' he told reporters.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Chile's foreign minister said Tuesday that
his government is considering legal action against Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, but ruled out a deal guaranteeing he'd stand trial at
home if Britain rejects an extradition request from Spain.
	   The minister, Jose Miguel Insulza, has argued that it is
unnecessary to try Pinochet in Spain for crimes committed during
his 1973-1990 dictatorship. A government lawsuit would strengthen
his case.
	   ``The government is studying whether to join existing suits,''
filed this year in Chile, Insulza said. ``The possibility of a
trial in Chile exists and gets larger every day.''
	   Human rights activists have dismissed the possibility of a
Chilean trial for the former dictator since has wide-ranging
immunity at home.
	   A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared at the hands of the police after Pinochet seized power
in a military coup that toppled the democratically elected
president, Salvador Allende.
	   Chile, Insulza said, was ``under no obligation'' to promise that
the 83-year-old retired general would stand trial if allowed home
from London, where he has been under police guard since being
detained Oct. 16 while recuperating from back surgery.
	   Insulza insisted that a Spanish judge's attempt to extradite
Pinochet on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture was an
affront to Chilean sovereignty and its transition to democracy.
	   According to Insulza, who is pressing for Pinochet's release,
Chile should be allowed to deal with the legacy of general's 17
years in power without interference.
	   Pinochet has many supporters, there is widespread fear of
violence if he is prosecuted.
	   ``There is no reason to call into doubt the solidity of
democracy in Chile or our capacity to resolve our own problems,''
Insulza said, after stressing that the affair had triggered
``polarization, break down of dialogue and sharp political
confrontation.''
	   Spain's foreign minister, Abel Matutes, said the Spanish
government was powerless to act, since all remaining decisions on
Pinochet's fate were in British hands.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Insulza met Supreme Court Deputy President Luis
Lopez and Senate President Juan Ignacio Barrero, and was to later
meet Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar.
	   Prior to arriving Monday in Madrid, Insulza spent four days
lobbying the British government whose Home Secretary, Jack Straw,
has until Dec. 11 to decide whether to let extradition proceedings
go ahead.
	   Insulza said his trip had produced ``some positive indications''
but he declined to give details.

Bosnians receives first shipment of new coins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A shipment of nine million
newly minted coins reached Bosnia on Tuesday to replace chewing gum
and chocolate bars as the country's loose change.
	   The coins, made by London's Royal Mint, are the first to reach
Bosnia since the summer when the country introduced a new currency,
the Konvertibilna Marka. The currency, valued at one German Mark,
or about 63 cents, had been issued only in bank notes until now.
	   Due to the lack of coinage, Bosnian shops use chewing gum as
ersatz 10 Fening coins and small chocolate bars to replace 20
Fening coins. There are 100 Fenings to the Marka.
	   ``We will waste no time putting the coins into circulation ...
so that people can feel them jingling in their pockets,'' said
Peter Nicholl, the governor of Bosnia's Central Bank. ``A sound
that symbolizes a solid future, built on a sound currency.''
	   The 10, 20 and 50 Fening coins are to be put into general
circulation this month.
	   While shops had given chewing gum and chocolate bars as small
change, they refused to accept them as payment for goods. Many
customers have been left with large candy stashes.
	   Bosnia's market used up to four different currencies until this
summer when the Kovertibilna Marka was launched.
	   The Bosnian Serbs used the Yugoslav Dinar, the Bosnian Croats
the Croatian Kuna and the central Muslim-dominated parts their own
money. The German Mark remains accepted everywhere.

Hoechst, Rhone-Poulenc merger: bigger may not be better
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The merger of Hoechst AG of Germany and France's
Rhone-Poulenc SA will create an international drugs giant rivaling
world leader Merck and Co.
	   But analysts warn that in this case, bigger may not necessarily
be better.
	   Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc's combined life sciences company, to
be called Aventis, will have annual sales of around dlrs 20
billion, spanning pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals and
animal health products, the companies said Tuesday, outlining their
long-rumored merger plans.
	   Company executives were upbeat, saying annual cost savings of
dlrs 1.2 billion over three years will boost profits until new
products begin hitting the market. But the new company may have
trouble producing enough new lucrative drugs to match competitors'
profitability.
	   In a news conference held in Strasbourg, where the new company
will be based, the two companies said creation of the 50-50 joint
venture is a first step toward fully merging the companies within
three years.
	   ``Unlike what has happened to other companies in our industry,
the creation of Aventis _ provided we obtain all the necessary
authorizations _ will be translated into reality,'' Rhone-Poulenc
Chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou said.
	   Despite concerns over profitability and research capabilities,
the combination will allow the companies to improve their marketing
muscle in the United States. And Aventis will be able to negotiate
better deals with U.S. managed care providers, observers said.
	   ``Each company could not have found a better partner in terms of
size, culture and compatibility,'' said Ian Broadhurst, a
pharmaceutical analyst at Enskilda Securities in London.
	   Seeking to calm investors' worries over the company's merger
plans, Rhone-Poulenc executives said they would trim the new
company's debt burden over the next four years, while expanding in
the United States.
	   Still, while Aventis will be able to compete with the top drug
companies in terms of revenue, industry leaders such as Merck,
Britain's Glaxo Welsome PLC and Switzerland's Navartis AG are still
ahead when it comes to profitability and research productivity.
	   ``Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc share the same problems _ low
profitability and underpowered research and development
portfolios,'' said Paul Diggle, a drug analyst with Societe
Generale in London.
	   Also, analysts said cost-cutting projections are below average
for mergers in the industry, shedding further doubt on the
companies' ability to quickly boost profit.
	   The merger announcement comes on the heels of a flurry of major
cross-border transactions including Daimler Benz AG's acquisition
of Chrysler Corp., Deutsche Bank AG's purchase of Bankers Trust and
French oil company Total SA's agreement Tuesday to take over the
Belgian petrochemicals company Petrofina SA.
	   And within the pharmaceutical sector, the Hoechst-Rhone-Poulenc
link-up is likely to encourage more matchmaking. While a series of
drug companies have recently decided against mergers, the
Franco-German combination could renew the trend. Most imminently,
France's Sanofi SA and Synthelabo SA are said to be in advanced
talks on their own marriage.
	   ``This deal starts to change the scene,'' Diggle said. ``Drug
companies in the U.S. and elsewhere will be gently moving in the
direction of more consolidation.''
	   But some warned that strong labor unions in Germany and France
could hamper merger plans for Hoechst and Rhone Poulenc.
	   ``France and Germany are particularly difficult places to cut
costs,'' said Broadhurst.
	   Unions in France and Germany have been critical of the merger so
far, fearing that cost cutting will lead to layoffs. Hoechst
employs 118,000 workers and Rhone-Poulenc employs 68,000.
	   Rhone-Poulenc shares finished 7 percent lower at 263.4 francs
(dlrs 46.2) as investors expressed concern over prospects for the
new company.

Disgraced directors make bid for reinstatement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEWCASTLE, England (AP) _ The two former Newcastle United
directors who stepped down in disgrace after making disparaging
remarks about the club's supporters and the city's women are
seeking to be reinstated.
	   Douglas Hall and Freddy Shepherd launched a bid Tuesday to
return to the company board of the Premier League club.
	   Hall and Shepherd left the board last season after being caught
on film mocking Newcastle fans for paying high prices for club
merchandise, describing Newcastle women as ``dogs'' and calling
star striker Alan Shearer ``Mary Poppins.''
	   Hall's Cameron Hall Developments, which owns 57 percent of the
club, has proposed that the two former bosses be brought back.
	   The pair want to replace their representatives on the board,
John Fender and Tom Fenton.
	   While the move will go before a vote of shareholders, Hall's
holding combined with the 8.1 percent owned by a trust run by
Shepherd means the pair can easily vote themselves back onto the
board.
	   Chairman Dennis Cassidy delayed the company's Annual General
Meeting to give remaining shareholders a chance to consider the
plan. The meeting was originally scheduled for next Monday.
	   The two were reinstated to the soccer club board in July but not
to the main company board.

French court to decide fate of American fugitive in January
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with new color, quotes
 &UR; By IAN PHILLIPS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Pointing his finger at the French judge,
American fugitive Ira Einhorn on Tuesday again denied he killed his
girlfriend, while the victim's family members glared at him in
disbelief.
	   The graying former hippie guru, fighting U.S. efforts to get him
extradited back to Pennsylvania, tried to persuade the judge of his
innocence even though a U.S. court has found him guilty.
	   ``One thing,'' Einhorn said, pointing emphatically, as he took
the stand for his sole declaration. ``I did not kill Holly Maddux.
C'est tout. (That's all.)''
	   The victim's family occasionally glared Einhorn before the judge
deferred a decision on the extradition request - the second by the
United States - until Jan. 12.
	   A prominent anti-war campaigner and activist in the 1960s,
Einhorn, now 57, fled the United States shortly before his trial.
But after 16 years in hiding, he was tracked down and arrested at
his French home in June 1997.
	   Elisabeth Hall, the victim's sister, traveled from Texas for the
hearing with her two sisters and brother. She said the experience
left her cold.
	   ``He was smirking as he said it,'' Hall said. ``It was a clear
attempt to provoke some kind of outburst. He's a pitiful character
and he knows exactly what he's done.''
	   It was the first time in 20 years that the family saw Einhorn.
	   ``It was somewhat anti-climactic, because I did not feel a surge
of anger,'' Hall said. ``But he was intimidated by our presence.''
	   When Maddux, a former cheerleader from Tyler, Texas,
disappeared, Einhorn said she had gone shopping and never returned.
	   But 18 months later, neighbors told police of a stench coming
from Einhorn's apartment, and Maddux's battered remains were found.
Forensic experts said her skull had been smashed six times.
	   Maddux's family said they would consider returning to France in
January and would continue to appeal if France rejects the
extradition.
	   ``We are here in France to remind the judges that underneath all
this international law and political squabbling, there is a person
who was murdered and who looks like us,'' Hall said.
	   ``Anybody can see there has been a definite undercurrent of
anti-Americanism,'' she said.
	   A French court refused to extradite Einhorn in December 1997,
citing a French law that would have required a retrial if he was
extradited. Pennsylvania then passed a law promising Einhorn a
retrial. He was re-arrested in September.
	   His defense lawyers argue that, if extradited, Einhorn could
face the death penalty, which is banned under French law. They also
claim Pennsylvania courts might withdraw the pledge of a retrial.
	   ``This is not a matter of judging U.S. law,'' said prosecution
lawyer Francois Munch. ``This is a matter of finding who killed
Holly Maddux.''
	   In a November interview on ABC television, Einhorn declared his
innocence and claimed the CIA or KGB framed him after he uncovered
classified mind-control experiments.

Tensions in Israel rise over Palestinian prisoners, Jewish
</HEADLINE>
settlements &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A senior Palestinian official on Tuesday
appealed to U.S. President Bill Clinton to resolve growing tensions
over Israel's refusal to release jailed anti-Israel activists.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he could not
release prisoners who had been involved in attacks on Israelis. ``I
will not back down on this,'' he vowed.
	   The issue, which has prompted clashes between stone-throwing
Palestinian youths and Israeli soldiers, is raising concern about
an outbreak of violence before Clinton's Dec. 12-15 visit to Israel
and the Palestinian-ruled lands.
	   The Israeli daily Haaretz reported that Israeli security
officials had urged Netanyahu to agree to free more Palestinian
activists to prevent rioting.
	   Palestinians claim that Israel promised at last month's Wye
River summit to free 750 prisoners from political factions such as
Yasser Arafat's Fatah group. Israel released 250 prisoners last
month, but most were car thieves and petty crooks.
	   ``This deception is creating demonstrations, anger and
frustration in the Palestinian community,'' Ahmed Tibi, an adviser
to Arafat, said at a Foreign Press Association news conference.
	   Demonstrations have been held almost daily in support of
Palestinian prisoners, with some of the anger turned on Yasser
Arafat and his government.
	   On Tuesday, protests were held in the West Bank town of Ramallah
where several hundred demonstrators gathered and in the Gaza Strip,
where about 150 children demanded the release of their fathers.
	   ``How can we live without our fathers?'' said Fidda Washah, 16,
who addressed the rally. Her father, Jabar, a member of the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine faction, has served 14 years
of a life sentence for attacking Israeli soldiers.
	   Netanyahu said he would not release anyone ``with blood on their
hands'' or members of the Islamic militant group Hamas.
	   ``The Palestinians are claiming, falsely, that I suggested
somehow to free murders at Wye,'' Netanyahu told reporters.
	   Israeli officials say only about 110 of the 2,500 Palestinian
activists behind bars could be let go in the next release,
scheduled to take place just after Clinton's visit.
	   Tibi, who was spokesman for the Palestinian delegation at Wye
Mills, Maryland, said only about 300 of the Palestinians currently
in jail had been involved in attacks that killed Israelis. The rest
he described as ``political prisoners.''
	   He said about 1,250 prisoners who were members of various PLO
factions and the remainder belonged to Hamas.
	   ``We would very much like him (Clinton) to interfere in the
issue of Palestinian prisoners,'' said Tibi.
	   Palestinian officials urged residents of the West Bank to
confront Israeli bulldozers that are expanding settlements or
building roads to link Israeli-controlled areas of the West Bank
and Israel.
	   ``Settlement activity should be resisted,'' said Tibi.
``Settlers are public enemy No. 1 to Palestinians.''
	   Several members of the Palestinian legislative council are
considering a boycott of Clinton's speech in Gaza City on Dec. 14
to show their anger over a failure by the United States to pressure
Israel on the settlement and prisoner issues.
	   In traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, meanwhile, Israeli
contractors bidding on the Har Homa Jewish housing project in
visited the construction site where left-wing Israelis staged a
protest. Police detained three demonstrators from the Peace Now
group trying to disrupt the tour.
	   The Palestinians hope to establish a future capital in east
Jerusalem. They say Har Homa is part of an Israeli plan to cut off
the Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem from their hinterland in
Bethlehem and the southern West Bank.

Britain prepares frosty reception for Zimbabwe president

 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Mugabe arriving in London, graf 3.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain prepared a frosty reception Tuesday for
visiting Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe _ angered by new moves to
seize white-owned farms, intervention in the Congo's civil war, a
ban on strikes, and his flying to Libya in defiance of a U.N.
embargo.
	   Although Mugabe's visit was billed as private, Foreign Office
Minister Tony Lloyd had asked to see him, officials said.
	   Mugabe, increasingly unpopular in his central African nation,
arrived in London Tuesday afternoon from Paris, where he attended a
French-African summit after visiting Libya and Egypt. There was no
official word on his visit, and the Zimbabwe High Commission, or
embassy, did not return calls.

Cuba declares Christmas permanent holiday

 &UR; By JOHN RICE &QC;

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Christmas in Cuba is back for good.
	   The Communist Party used the entire front page of Cuba's only
daily newspaper, Granma, on Tuesday to recommend that ``from this
year on'' Dec. 25 should be a holiday in Cuba, formally
re-establishing a custom abolished in 1969.
	   The proposal is sure to be adopted by the Communist country's
government.
	   The Roman Catholic archbishop's office had no immediate reaction
to the recommendation.
	   The government granted a Christmas holiday last year as a
one-time favor to Pope John Paul II, who visited in January. But at
the time it balked at declaring the measure permanent.
	   Cuba abolished the Christmas holiday in 1969, saying it
interfered with the mobilization of manpower for the sugar harvest.
	   The party declaration insisted that the abolition of the holiday
was not inspired by any anti-religious sentiment.
	   However, the government at the time was avowedly atheist and
Christians were barred from being members of the Communist Party or
of holding many sensitive jobs.
	   Christmas trees were strongly discouraged.
	   In recent years, the government has declared itself secular
rather than atheist, has dropped restrictions on Christians and
moved to improve ties with Cuba's churches and other religions.
	   Even state stores are selling plastic Christmas trees and
ornaments this year.
	   In its statement, the party praised churches for condemning the
U.S. embargo of Cuba, for sending aid and for speaking out in favor
of social justice around the world.

IMF head in Moscow for talks on loans

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With Russia's leaders urgently seeking financial
help, International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus began two
days of talks in Moscow today on Russia's frozen loan agreement
with the IMF.
	   Camdessus met with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov today and was
scheduled to hold broader talks with government officials
Wednesday.
	   ``I want to get better acquainted with the prime minister,''
Camdessus told reporters. ``I presume we will be having interesting
conversations.''
	   President Boris Yeltsin, who is in a hospital being treated for
pneumonia, spoke with Primakov by telephone today about the talks
with Camdessus.
	   In the Netherlands, meanwhile, former Russian Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin sought to reassure international investors that
Russia would survive its economic problems.
	   He told an international business conference that his country's
economic woes were ``far from desperate,'' adding: ``European
companies are still with us. They are not leaving Russia.''
	   Russia is seeking further installments on an IMF bailout package
that was reached in the summer, but was held up after the
government devalued the ruble and defaulted on some of its debts in
August. The IMF has said Russia must come up with a realistic
recovery plan before more money will be released.
	   Camdessus is not expected to announce any breakthroughs, but his
visit gives Russia an opportunity to make its case and lobby for
fresh funds.
	   The bailout package totals $22.6 billion and also involves the
World Bank and the Japanese government, but Russia has so far
received only about $5 billion.
	   An IMF mission left town last week saying the government's
revenue forecast for next year was overly optimistic. It also
disapproved of the government's intention to lower taxes and offer
subsidies to ailing industries.
	   If the Russian government doesn't receive foreign help soon, it
will probably have to start printing money, which would drive up
inflation.
	   ``I hope that the IMF would be able to make a decision to
provide aid to Russia that would allow us to avoid
hyperinflation,'' Oleg Sysuyev, a top presidential aide, was quoted
as saying today by the Interfax news agency.
	   The government has been delaying a debate on next year's budget
as it struggles to find ways to come up with enough money to meet
its expenses. The Cabinet again delayed the discussion this week,
but insisted the delay was not connected with Camdessus' visit.
	   However, the Russian media claimed the government put off action
on the budget because it is still hoping for the IMF loans.
	   ``Everyone understands that budget parameters remain vague, and
their clarification depends on Camdessus' visit,'' the business
daily Kommersant said today.
	   Former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, who was on a trip to the
United States this week, said Russia wouldn't be able to pay $17.5
billion in foreign debt that comes due next year.
	   ``The IMF must realize that and accept compromises with Russia
in reaching agreements on restructuring foreign debts,'' Kiriyenko
said at New York University on Monday, according to the Interfax
news agency.

Report: Crime and suicide rising in Russian military
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Crime and suicide continue to rise in the
demoralized Russian military with a growing number of officers
taking their own lives because of late pay and poverty, the
Interfax News Agency reported Tuesday.
	   Citing Defense Ministry statistics, the report said some 10,500
crimes and incidents had been recorded in the armed forces during
the first 11 months of 1998, compared to about 10,000 in all of
1997.
	   The Russian military has been falling apart in recent years
because the cash-strapped government can provide only a fraction of
the funding budgeted for the armed forces. Soldiers and officers
routinely go months without pay, often live in appalling
conditions, and bullying and crime are rampant.
	   Overall, the number of deaths in the military has declined, the
report said.
	   Some 500 servicemen were killed or died on active service
compared to 600 deaths last year. More than 800 servicemen were
killed or died in off-duty situations compared to about 1,000 such
deaths in 1997, the report said, without adding any further
details.
	   But suicides are climbing with about 350 cases reported this
year, said the report, without providing figures for last year.
More than 60 percent of suicides involved officers, and poverty and
delays in salaries were cited as the main reason, it said.

Portuguese Internet users stage 24-hour boycott
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ More than 3,000 Internet users in
Portugal began a 24-hour boycott Tuesday to protest what they call
costly and poor service for surfing the Web, news reports said.
	   The protesters urged people to stay off-line until midnight
Tuesday (0000 GMT) to protest against Portugal Telecom and the
country's three Internet access providers, the Lisbon radio station
TSF said.
	   They also complained about having to pay twice.
	   Portugal Telecom charges Internet users up to escudos 208 (about
dlrs 1.2) for each hour they are on-line. On top of that, the
access providers charge as much as escudos 5,000 (about dlrs 30)
for 30 hours of Internet use.

Roadside bombs kill Israeli-backed militiaman, injure another

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hezbollah claiming more attacks, changes dateline

<TEXT>
	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ Hezbollah guerrillas carried out four
attacks against Israeli and allied militiamen in south Lebanon
Tuesday, killing one fighter, security officials said.
	   The victim was a member of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon
Army, who was killed in an explosion outside the town of Jezzine,
said the officials.
	   Another explosion in Jezzine, 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of
Israel's panhandle, wounded another SLA militiaman, said the
officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Guerrillas also targeted joint SLA-Israeli military positions in
the Lebanese villages of Blatt and Sojod, both about 500 meters
(yards) north of the Israeli border. No casualties were reported,
said the Lebanese officials.
	   They confirmed the attacks were carried out by Hezbollah.
	   The Shiite Muslim movement Hezbollah, or Party of God, said in
statements its guerrillas targeted outposts belonging to SLA and
Israeli troops in the central and western sectors of an
Israeli-occupied enclave in South Lebanon.
	   The attacks came amid mounting tension in Lebanon following
Israeli threats to bomb the capital Beirut to avenge the deaths of
Israeli soldiers. Seven Israelis have been killed by guerrillas in
south Lebanon since mid-November.
	   Hezbollah, of the Party of God, is leading a guerrilla battle to
oust the SLA and Israeli soldiers from an enclave that Israel has
occupied in south Lebanon since 1985.
	   Israel claims the occupation is needed to protect its northern
towns from attack, but the frequent deaths of Israeli soldiers in
south Lebanon has raised debate in Israel about maintaining the
occupation.

Matt Perry ruled out of Saturday's Test
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with further details

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England full-back Matt Perry has been ruled out of
Saturday's rugby union Test against South Africa at Twickenham.
	   Perry suffered a concussion during last weekend's defeat against
Australia and will be sidelined for three weeks, England coach
Clive Woodward said Tuesday.
	   With Paul Grayson and Will Greenwood still questionable with
injuries, Woodward called up David Rees and Alex King into the
squad to provide cover at wing and fly-half.
	   Perry was injured in the final seconds of the 12-11 defeat
against the Wallabies at Twickenham. Doctors said he should take
off at least three weeks.
	   Grayson, who limped off with a knee injury against the Aussies,
and center Greenwood, who failed to make the match, are still under
treatment.
	   Perry's absence could clear the way for in-form Northampton
full-back Nick Beal to take over, although Woodward won't be making
any further announcements until Thursday.
	   Mike Catt, who last played for England against France last
February, could also be considered at full-back.
	   Scrum-half Kyran Bracken will also miss the Springboks clash due
to injury, meaning a chance for Matt Dawson. Fly-half Jonny
Wilkinson is out with fitness problems.
	   Rees, who only recently returned to action after suffering a
serious groin injury last season, will strongly challenge wing
incumbents Tony Underwood and Austin Healey.
	   Rees hasn't played for England since the Five Nations
Championship earlier this year, while King is set to pressure Catt
as a possible replacement for number 10 and goalkicker Paul
Grayson.
	   The South Africa Springboks will set a world record of 18
consecutive Test victories if they beat England on Saturday. They
would eclipse the New Zealand All Blacks' 17-match winning streak
between 1965 and 1969.
	   ``I don't see any country going through a winning run of 17 or
18 Tests in the future,'' Springboks coach Nick Mallett said.

Italian powerhouse signs Romanian coach to replace Simoni
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Italian soccer powerhouse Internazionale on
Tuesday signed Romanian Mircea Lucescu to coach the star-studded
but volatile Milan team through the end of the Serie A campaign in
May.
	   Lucescu's appointment, on a reported one billion lire (dlrs
555,000) contract, was announced at Inter's training camp the day
after the sensational dismissal of Gigi Simoni.
	   The Italian veteran coach was fired on Monday despite
consecutive wins which kept Inter in the running for titles in the
Champions Cup and in the Italian League.
	   Club president and oil industrialist Massimo Moratti had
bitterly criticized the quality of Inter's play following a 3-1
victory against defending champion Real Madrid in a Champions
League game last Wednesday and an injury-time 2-1 win against
low-ranked Salernitana in a league match Sunday.
	   Inter, whose roster includes such stars as Ronaldo, Youri
Djorkaeff, Roberto Baggio, Diego Simeone and Ivan Zamorano, is
currently sixth in the league standings, five points behind leader
Fiorentina. Its record is five wins, two draws and four losses.
	   Lucescu, a former coach of the Romanian national team and of
several clubs including Dynamo Bucharest and Italy's Brescia and
Reggiana, was presented to the Italian media at Appiano Gentile
Tuesday afternoon.
	   He then directed the first training session with Inter players
for Sunday's league match against Vicenza.
	   ``I will need time to change the team ... to switch to zone
defense and make the play more offensive,'' Lucescu told reporters.
	   ``I'm convinced I did the right thing,'' Moratti said Tuesday.
``I think to have interpreted the feeling of our fans, who were
unhappy with the team play.''
	   Inter enjoyed a record of 60,000 season tickets this year after
it won the UEFA title and finished second to Juventus in the
Italian league last season.
	   Simoni, whose stay with Inter was stormy since the beginning of
his two-year contract, said Tuesday he was the victim of ``an
unfair, unexpected decision.''
	   Some Italian sports dailies suggested that Simoni paid for the
bad season start of Brazilian superstar Ronaldo, who has been
repeatedly sidelined with knee tendinitis and failed to provide the
Milan team the decisive support and goals given in the previous
campaign.
	   Simoni had been also frequently criticized for his overly
defensive tactics.
	   Lucescu, 53, was expected to keep Inter's bench warm for Italian
coach Marcello Lippi, who may leave league champion Juventus of
Turin at the end of this season and join Inter for the 1998-99
campaign.
	   However Moratti denied a decision for the next season had been
taken already.
	   ``Lucescu can prove he deserves to coach a great team. He could
be a more lasting solution,'' Moratti said.

Norway's state phone company buys stake in Russia's Vimpel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The Norwegian state telephone company,
Telenor ASA, on Tuesday announced that it was buying a 25-percent
stake in Russia's largest cellular telephone provider, Vimpel
Communications, for dlrs 160 million.
	   Vimpel, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, has
Russian government licenses to provide mobile telephone coverage to
areas inhabited by 100 million people.
	   According to a news release from Telenor, Vimpel plans to use
the extra stock capital to help expand its GSM, fiber-optic and
Internet services. Telenor said the company has about half the
cellular phone market in Moscow.
	   ``The investment in Vimpel is in keeping with our strategic
ambitions in Russia,'' Tormod Hermansen, head of Telenor.
	   The deal is contingent on approval by 75 percent of Vimpel's
shareholders and the Russian government. The sale could be
completed by June 1.
	   Vimpel reported an operating profit of dlrs 61 million last
year, on a turnover of dlrs 306 million.

Reprieve for duty-free shopping fails to gain EU support

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reprieve failing to gain enough support &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Hopes of a reprieve for duty free sales
for travelers within the European Union appeared short-lived
Tuesday as a proposal to delay a planned abolition failed to gain
sufficient support among EU finance ministers.
	   France proposed extending the life of the popular tax-free sales
on flights, ports and ferry crossings for five years beyond June
30, 1999, when the EU is scheduled to scrap them. Germany and
Britain backed the proposal along with Greece, Spain and Ireland.
	   However the bid to save duty-free shopping needed support from
all 15 EU nations and Denmark, the Netherlands, Portugal, Italy,
Finland and Sweden refused to budge. Austria, Belgium and
Luxembourg did not take a stance.
	   In 1991, EU nations all voted to abolish the tax free shopping,
claiming it was incompatible with the notion of a borderless EU
market. They need unanimity to reverse that decision.

EU, NKorea to hold first-ever talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ North Korea, still suffering from a
devastating famine, held its first talks with the European Union on
Wednesday, discussing human rights, food aid and security on the
Korean peninsula.
	   The aim of the meeting is to see if Europeans can have a
regular, political dialogue with North Korea, one of the last
hard-line communist nations.
	   ``We are quite pleased North Korea has agreed to debate a broad
agenda of issues,'' EU spokesman Nigel Gardner said Tuesday.
	   The EU side will include mid-level officials from Austria,
Britain and Germany and Percy Westerlund, a Swede who is director
general at the European Commission's foreign affairs office.
	   Gardner would not speculate on why North Korea had agreed to
talks here and could not give a list of North Korean participants.
	   However, North Korea has reached out to other nations due to an
ongoing famine has forced residents of remote areas to subsist on
leaves and twigs, according to visitors to the hermetic nation.
	   Gardner also said the EU-North Korea talks will touch on efforts
by Japan, South Korea, the United States and the EU to build two
nuclear reactors for North Korea, which was suspected of developing
atomic weapons under the guise of nuclear power programs.
	   The three nations and the EU formed a consortium in 1994, known
as the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, that
recently approved a new dlrs 4.6 billion estimate for the two
reactors.
	   KEDO was created after North Korea agreed to freeze and
eventually dismantle its nuclear weapons program in exchange for
two light-water nuclear power plants and 500,000-ton annual fuel
oil shipments until they are completed.
	   The reactors are to be ready for use by 2003 and will replace
North Korea's Soviet-developed graphite-moderated reactors that
produce greater amounts of weapons-grade plutonium.

Alleged godfather had interests across the world

 &UR; Eds: ADDS approval for video evidence, grafs 7 and 8, CLARIFIES
that FBI witnesses are Russian, trims &QL; 
 &UR; By NAOMI KOPPEL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The man accused of heading a Russian mafia
organization had so much influence that he could get a hostage
released in Chechnya ``with a few telephone calls,'' a Swiss court
heard Tuesday.
	   A Swiss police inspector testified that when arrested two years
ago at Geneva airport, Sergei Mikhailov, was carrying two passports
from Russia, one from Israel and a diplomatic passport from Costa
Rica.
	   Officers later found false papers from Greece and Portugal and a
passport from Guyana, believed to have been bought for thousands of
dollars. He also lived in Austria and Belgium during the 1990s and
had been banned from entering both France and the Czech Republic,
said Police Inspector Patrick Scheurer.
	   Mikhailov, whose trial opened Monday, is accused of being a
member of a criminal organization. Prosecutors say he is the head
of the Solntsevskaya mafia in Moscow, which has 1,700 members and
the power to take over entire institutions in the city.
	   Mikhailov denies the charge, as well as one relating to the
purchase of his villa which allegedly broke the Swiss laws on
foreigners buying property.
	   The trial has seen unprecedented security measures, with the
court ringed by police, sheets at the windows to stop people seeing
in and bullet-proof vests for Mikhailov and some of the witnesses.
	   The court late Tuesday agreed that three witnesses believed to
be particularly at risk could give evidence by video link from an
adjacent room _ the first time this has happened in Geneva.
	   Former Russian police major Nikolai Oporov and two Russians
under FBI protection will only be seen by the judge and jury so
that no one else can recognize them.
	   After two failed attempts by the defense to stop the trial
Monday, Scheurer took the stand as the first prosecution witness.
	   He said witnesses would tell how Mikhailov had arranged for the
release of the brother of a business partner who was being held by
a gang in the Russian break-away republic of Chechnya.
	   ``With a few phone calls he managed to rescue the brother,''
said Scheurer, adding this showed how much influence Mikhailov had
with other criminal gangs.
	   Scheurer said in Mikhailov's lavish villa near Geneva, police
found illegal listening equipment, cash totaling 47,000 Swiss
francs (dlrs 33,500) and photographs of Mikhailov with other known
criminals.
	   One showed him standing with the son of Vyacheslav Ivankov, the
mafia godfather known as Yaponchik who is currently in prison in
the United States.
	   Scheurer also described how police had become suspicious about
how Mikhailov was conducting his affairs from inside his prison
cell.
	   ``He never wanted to telephone, he didn't write, he received no
visits except from his lawyers,'' he said.
	   One of Mikhailov's lawyers was later arrested as he left the
prison and was found to be carrying letters which had not been
passed by the censor.
	   The trial is expected to last at least a fortnight. Mikhailov,
who has been in custody for more than two years, faces a maximum of
seven-and-a-half years in prison.

Medical tests point to doping at Festina
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS positive amphetamine tests for Moreau, Rous, Brochard,
Herve, background of Festina officials who have been charged
 &UR; By SEBASTIEN BOUWY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ Medical tests suggest that cyclists on the
Festina team, expelled from the Tour de France this summer, took
banned drugs, judicial sources said Tuesday citing a judge's
report.
	   In addition to the presence of erythropoietin (EPO), a banned
drug that Festina officials had already admitted using, the report
included new revelations that amphetamines were found in the tests
of four cyclists.
	   The four named were Laurent Brochard, the 1997 world road racing
champion; Christophe Moreau; Didier Rous; and Pascal Herve.
	   But top Festina cyclist Richard Virenque said the figures
vindicate his claim that he didn't take banned substances.
	   Judge Patrick Keil called Virenque and teammates Pascal Herve
and Laurent Brochard to Lille to give them the results of tests
carried out in July.
	   According to judicial sources who saw the report, the results
showed Virenque had a hematocrit level of 49.3 percent. The
hematocrit level measures the proportion of red blood cells in a
blood sample _ one sign of doping, since the substances increase
red blood cells.
	   But Virenque's level is just within the limit of 50 percent set
by the International Cycling Union, the sport's governing body.
	   Herve had a level of 52.6.
	   Medical experts have been analyzing blood, urine and hair tests
since Festina team manager Bruno Roussel admitted during the race
to the use of the banned substance EPO among cyclists.
	   Virenque and Herve both deny they knowingly took any banned
substances.
	   ``The biological parameters demonstrate scientifically that I
didn't take (doping agents),'' Virenque said as he left the
hearing. ``Today I am relieved and I hope soon hope to get back on
a bike. It is the end of a nightmare.''
	   Gilbert Collard, Virenque's lawyer, said that ``no traces of
anabolics, growth hormones, amphetamines or masking products were
brought to attention concerning Richard Virenque.''
	   However, testing remains an inexact science and the results
announced by Keil suggest that eight of Festina's nine cyclists
took banned substances.
	   Virenque's future remains uncertain.
	   Festina has cut by half its budget for next season, is
renegotiating contracts with all its riders and has already said
the Frenchman will probably not be a member of the team next year.
	   Three of the Spanish team's Swiss cyclists _ Alex Zuelle,
Laurent Dufaux and Armin Meier _ have been banned from all
competition until May 1 after they admitted taking EPO.
	   Three Festina officials have been put under formal
investigation, one step short of being formally charged:
physiotherapist Willy Voet; team doctor Eric Ryckaert; and sporting
director Bruno Roussel.

Euro-zone nations break deadlock over international representation
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ With just a month to go before the
launch of the euro, European Union finance ministers reached an
11th-hour agreement Tuesday on who should speak for the
single-currency bloc on the world stage.
	   The agreement resolved months of deadlock between big and small
euro-zone nations over representation of the 11-nation currency
bloc at the G-7 group of world economic powers and other
international bodies.
	   Under the compromise, the euro-zone's three existing G-7 nations
- Germany, France and Italy - keep their seats and will take turns
to represent the bloc. Smaller nations will get to sit alongside
them at G-7 meetings, when they hold the rotating euro-zone
presidency.
	   German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine will therefore speak
for the euro-zone for the first six months of 1999, to be joined by
his Finnish counterpart Sauli Niniisto for second half of the year.
	   Wim Duisenberg, president of the new European Central Bank, will
get a G-7 seat. But the EU's executive Commission will offered only
a ``technical support'' role.
	   The launch of the euro as the shared currency of 11 EU nations
on Jan. 1 will create a single bloc that will rival the United
States and Japan as a global economic power.
	   But while U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Japanese
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa can always get on the phone to
discuss the world economic situation, nobody was sure whom to call
when they want to speak to the euro-bloc.
	   The rotating system of euro-zone presidencies should go some way
to meeting that need. The deal is set to be confirmed by EU leaders
at their year-end summit next week in Vienna. Details of how the
euro-zone will be represented at the International Monetary Fund
and other world bodies are also expected to be finalized in the
Austrian capital.
	   There was no immediate reaction from other G-7 nations _ the
United States, Japan and Canada _ who must agree to the proposal.
Lafontaine is scheduled to present the proposal at a meeting with
Rubin and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan Friday in
Washington.
	   ``It was very important that we defined the rules before the end
of the year,'' said French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn.
``I think the Americans will go along with it.''
	   If accepted, the new system will be applied at a G-7 finance
ministers and central bankers meeting Feb. 20 in Bonn, Germany.
Britain, the EU's fourth G-7 member, is staying out of the euro.
	   The EU ministers also called for an acceleration of efforts to
close corporate tax loopholes that cost national treasuries
billions of dollars in lost revenue. But differences remained over
talk of a wider harmonization of tax policies.
	   Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown repeated
British opposition to French and German suggestions of EU-wide tax
levels. ``There is no reason why the single currency should mean
the same tax rates across Europe,'' he told reporters.

Swimmer Gary Hall cleared to compete

 &UR; Eds: TOPS with judge upholding order &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PHOENIX (AP) _ Olympic champion Gary Hall was cleared on Tuesday
to swim in a World Cup meet despite a marijuana-related suspension
scheduled to run through Dec. 12.
	   U.S. District Judge Roger Strand, who issued a temporary
restraining order Monday allowing Hall to compete, stuck by his
ruling after giving FINA, swimming's world governing body, a chance
to respond.
	   Raymond Lembke, a lawyer for FINA, told Strand that Hall's
appeal should be dismissed and the rest of his suspension upheld.
He said the court should have no jurisdiction in the case.
	   On Monday, the Court of Arbitration of Sport in Switzerland
rejected Hall's request to temporarily place the suspension in
abeyance.
	   ``Our position is that FINA rules are prevailing in a case like
this,'' FINA secretary Gunnar Werner said Tuesday from Sweden.
``Our position is the court in the U.S. is not competent.''
	   Werner said an appeal would take too long and he will have to
abide by the decision. He added that the case underscores the
continuing battle between international federations and the courts,
particularly in the United States.
	   ``Our position is that FINA rules should prevail all around the
world,'' he said. ``But what can we do if a national court makes a
ruling? We can only fight for our position.''
	   Hall, who lives in Phoenix, won gold medals as part of the U.S.
400-meter freestyle and 400 medley relay teams in the 1996 Atlanta
Games. He also won silver medals in the 50 and 100 freestyle.
	   He was scheduled to compete in Friday's World Cup competition,
and later this week in the U.S. Open meet, both in College Station,
Texas.
	   His lawyers argued that both competitions are essential to
Hall's bid to compete in the 2000 Olympics and secure endorsements.
	   A ruling denying Hall permission to compete would be
``devastating not only to his career but financially,'' lawyer Ed
Hendricks told Strand during a one-hour hearing.
	   Hall was temporarily suspended in July after FINA said he tested
positive for marijuana during a May 15 competition in Phoenix. That
prevented Hall from swimming in the Goodwill Games and the U.S.
Senior Nationals.
	   The federation delayed the suspension in August to allow a
hearing after Hall appealed.
	   During a Nov. 6 hearing, Hall received a three-month suspension
from FINA's drug panel for testing positive for marijuana. That
suspension was effective Nov. 12.
	   FINA then deducted two of the three months already served by
Hall during the temporary suspension, which left him with 30 more
days to serve.

Gay rights campaigner convicted over church protest, given token
</HEADLINE>
fine &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Carey comment, graf 11; CLARIFIES in graf 2 that
Tatchell entered the pulpit; trims &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A gay rights activist who disrupted the Archbishop
of Canterbury's Easter Sunday sermon was convicted Tuesday of
indecent behavior in a church and fined a token 18.60 pounds (dlrs
30.69).
	   Peter Tatchell, leader of the British gay rights group Outrage,
was charged under the obscure 1860 Ecclesiastical Courts
Jurisdiction Act _ hence the amount of the fine _ for entering the
pulpit of Canterbury Cathedral as Dr. George Carey prepared to
preach to a congregation of 1,000.
	   While six of his fellow protesters held up placards, Tatchell
criticized Britain's leading cleric for opposing the reduction of
the homosexual age of consent and refusing to ordain gays.
	   His case sparked a high-profile campaign to get the 1860 law
repealed, with free speech campaigners pointing out he could be
jailed for up to two months _ the maximum penalty and the sentence
handed down when the law was last used in 1966 against anti-war
protesters who interrupted a church service.
	   But Canterbury Stipendiary Magistrate Michael Kelly settled for
a fine, saying he considered the offense equivalent to a minor
public disorder infraction.
	   During the two-day trial, Tatchell had argued that his right to
free speech was guaranteed under human rights laws. But the
magistrate said the same laws enshrined the right of people to
worship.
	   ``You are a man of previous good character and you have a clear
commitment to your cause and a belief in non-violent protest,''
Kelly said.
	   But he added, ``I am sure that some people will have been
disgusted and truly offended by your conduct.''
	   ``I think your conduct violated the rights of worshippers on one
of the most important days in the Christian calendar.''
	   Tatchell said after the trial that he had no regrets ``about
standing up for democracy.''
	   In a statement, Carey said in convicting Tatchell, the court
''has recognized unequivocally that his behavior cannot be
condoned; nor can the considerable pain and distress caused by Mr.
Tatchell to many people who were trying to engage in their legal
right to worship unmolested.''

British government won't free woman convicted of drug smuggling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: RECASTS lede with British government refusing to intervene,
ADDS quotes grafs 4-6

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The British Foreign Office said Tuesday it would
not intervene on behalf of a British woman convicted of heroin
trafficking in Thailand and seeking to have her 22-year prison
sentence reduced.
	   Sandra Gregory, 33, was convicted in 1996 and sentenced to 25
years in a Thai prison after being stopped at the Bangkok airport
with more than 100 grams (3.5 ounces) of heroin. Her sentence was
later reduced to 22 years under a general amnesty from the King of
Thailand, and she was transferred to a British prison last year
under a British-Thai prisoner exchange treaty.
	   In a letter published in Tuesday's edition of the Scotsman
newspaper, Stan and Doreen Gregory say they believe the government
should write to the King of Thailand requesting a reduction in the
sentence.
	   But a Foreign Office spokesman said that won't happen.
	   ``Sandra is already serving her sentence in the United Kingdom,
and it is government policy not to intervene and support Royal
Pardon petitions where the subject is in jail in this country,''
said the spokesman, speaking on the customary condition of
anonymity. ``In addition we would only consider supporting such a
petition if there were strong compassionate grounds, such as if the
prisoner was terminally ill.
	   ``That is not the case and while we are sympathetic to Sandra's
family, we have to bear in mind she has been convicted of a serious
drug smuggling offense involving heroin,'' the spokesman said.

Chile considering legal action against Pinochet, minister says

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Chile's foreign minister said Tuesday that
his government is considering legal action against Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, but ruled out a deal guaranteeing he'd stand trial at
home if Britain rejects an extradition request from Spain.
	   ``The government is studying whether to join existing suits,''
the minister, Jose Miguel Insulza, told reporters, referring to
private lawsuits filed this year in Chile against the former
despot.
	   ``The possibility of a trial in Chile exists and gets larger
every day,'' Insulza said to back his argument that trying Pinochet
in Spain for crimes committed during his 1973-1990 dictatorship is
unnecessary.
	   Human rights activists have dismissed this possibility because
Pinochet has wide-ranging immunity at home.
	   Insulza insisted that Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon's attempt to
extradite Pinochet to Spain on charges of genocide, terrorism and
torture was an affront to Chilean sovereignty and its transition to
democracy.
	   A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared at the hands of the police after Pinochet seized power
in a military coup that toppled democratically elected Marxist
President Salvador Allende.
	   Chile, Insulza said, was ``under no obligation'' to promise that
the 83-year-old retired general would stand trial if allowed home
from London where he has been under police guard pending possible
extradition since being detained on Oct. 16 while recuperating from
back surgery.
	   Insulza said Chile should be allowed to deal with the legacy of
general's 17 years in power without interference.
	   ``There is no reason to call into doubt the solidity of
democracy in Chile or our capacity to resolve our own problems,''
Insulza said, after stressing that the affair had triggered
``polarization, break down of dialogue and sharp political
confrontation.''
	   Insulza was speaking after talks with his Spanish counterpart
Abel Matutes. Later he met with Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar.
	   During a 40-minute meeting with Insulza, Aznar reiterated that
Pinochet's fate depended on Britain, not Spain, Europe Press
reported, quoting government officials.
	   Prior to arriving in Madrid Monday, Insulza spent four days
lobbying the British government whose Home Secretary, Jack Straw,
has until Dec. 11 to decide whether to allow extradition
proceedings to go ahead.
	   Insulza, who said his trip had produced ``some positive
indications'' but he declined to give details.
	   As well as Matutes and Aznar the Chilean minister filled up his
Spanish agenda by holding meetings with Defense Minister Eduardo
Serra, congressional president Federico Trillo, leaders from the
main opposition Socialist party, Supreme Court Deputy President
Luis Lopez and Senate President Juan Ignacio Barrero.
	   He was to meet Spanish business leaders later Tuesday before
leaving for Chile on a nightime flight.

U.N. genocide trial continues for Bosnian Serb killer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHRYN MASTERSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The man calling himself the ``Serb
Adolf'' seemed to enjoy murdering and torturing hundreds of Muslim
prisoners of war, a witness testified Tuesday at a U.N. trial.
	   Goran Jelisic, a 30-year-old Bosnian Serb, stands accused of
genocide before the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal. He has already
pleaded guilty to murdering 12 Muslims and Croats at a Serbian-run
detention camp near the northern Bosnian town of Brcko in 1992.
	   ``I think he took pleasure in doing this because he was so
powerful,'' said a 53-year-old Muslim camp survivor identified only
as Witness B. ``He said it was nice to kill.''
	   Although his guilty pleas mean an automatic conviction for war
crimes and crimes against humanity _ and the likelihood of a
maximum life sentence _ Jelisic has denied that the killing spree
constituted genocide.
	   By trying him for genocide, U.N. prosecutors will be able to
call evidence about the background of Jelisic's murders, including
the involvement of more senior Serbs.
	   During the testimony, the former mechanic who called himself
Adolf sat calmly, alternately leaning forward on the table in front
of him or slumping in his chair.
	   A Muslim witness, continuing his testimony from Monday's opening
day, detailed Jelisic's alleged brutality against Muslims.
	   Jelisic and other camp guards tortured and killed people at
will, Witness A said, calling Jelisic ``a beast.''
	   ``They simply knew we were Muslims and Croats. They simply
wanted to eradicate us,'' said Witness A, who was allowed to take a
short break after he began to sob on the stand.
	   ``I think this was killing of pleasure, out of some kind of hate
against my people. Those of us that survived... we all believe he
tried to inflict as much pain as possible,'' he said.
	   Set up in 1993 by the U.N. Security Council, the tribunal has
convicted two Muslims, two Bosnian Croats and a Bosnian Serb of war
crimes including murder, rape and torture, but it has yet to
register a conviction for genocide, the gravest offense the court
recognizes.
	   Jelisic faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for each
offense. His trial is expected to last well into 1999.
	   Another witness said he was taken to the Luka detention camp
with two busloads of Muslims. Witness B, another Muslim, said
Jelisic immediately confiscated their identification papers.
	   Jelisic called out names and said they would be executed. Then
he laughed and said he was only joking, the witness testified.
	   Witness B recounted that Jelisic interrogated visitors who said
they were visiting inmates for the May Day holiday, he accused them
of lying, the witness said.
	   ``He said, `This will by your last May Day,' and took them out
and killed them,'' the witness said.

Violations, police guard mark Russian election
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Polling stations will be heavily guarded during
local elections in St. Petersburg on Sunday _ a vote that is
believed to have played a part in the recent slaying of a prominent
liberal lawmaker.
	   Officials are also reporting multiple campaign violations as the
election nears, and two of the candidates have been formally
accused of corruption.
	   Russian media and politicians have suggested that lawmaker
Galina Starovoitova was killed to prevent her faction, Northern
Capital, from making a strong showing in the election to the
legislature in Russia's second-largest city.
	   Starovoitova was gunned down by unidentified assailants in her
apartment building in St. Petersburg last week. Police have
announced no major breakthroughs in the case.
	   Starovoitova was not on the ballot but was campaigning for her
allies, who have often spoken out against corruption.
	   The head of the Russian parliament's security committee, Viktor
Ilyukhin, on Tuesday joined those linking the killing to Sunday's
election.
	   ``Three or four crime rings in St. Petersburg largely control
business and politics,'' Ilyukhin was quoted as saying by the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   On Sunday, the 1,500 polling stations in the city will be
heavily guarded from the moment ballot papers are brought in, said
a senior St. Petersburg police official, Gen. Nikolai Fyodorov.
	   Police have also started intensifying security at public places
around the city, Fyodorov said Tuesday, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   St. Petersburg is a particularly crime-ridden city, even by
Russian standards. Several prominent political and business leaders
have been killed or attacked in there in recent weeks.
	   And the election seems to have more problems than even Russians
would expect.
	   One candidate, former head of Russia's influential Property
Committee and ex-parliament member Sergei Belyayev, has been
formally charged with corruption, prosecutors said Tuesday.
	   Another, businessman Alexander Moshkalov, was detained on
suspicion of extortion.
	   Vote rigging is also likely, the head of Russia's Central
Election Commission warned Tuesday.
	   ``Some cunning entrepreneurs have been collecting voter
signatures to sell them to interested candidates,'' Alexander
Ivanchenko said.
	   The results of several recent local elections in Russia had to
be canceled when winners were found to have criminal connections
and past criminal records.
	   ``Elections are turning into a low farce. Elections are turning
into a dispute between big and very big money,'' prominent liberal
lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky said Tuesday.
	   Starovoitova's death brought such problems to the limelight.
	   The killing had all the trademarks of a contract hit, which have
become common in Russia and are rarely solved. Many of the killings
are related to business disputes, but Starovoitova had no known
business interests. She was also perhaps the most prominent female
political figure in the country.

Honduras lowers Mitch death toll

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Honduras has lowered the official
death toll from Hurricane Mitch by 1,350 and suspended a governor
after investigators couldn't verify hundreds of deaths she reported
in her remote northwestern area.
	   The new death toll of 5,657 was compiled after the government
sent teams to verify reports from regions across Honduras, the
Interior Secretariat announced Tuesday.
	   Aid workers and journalists began questioning Honduras'
estimated death toll after figures jumped drastically Nov. 2, the
same day that news broke of a landslide in Nicaragua that covered
two villages and killed up to 2,000 people.
	   That day, Honduras' official death toll jumped from 600 to
5,000. Later, authorities raised the figure to 6,400, then last
week to 7,007.
	   The revised Honduras death toll lowers the overall death toll
for the hurricane to 9,071.
	   Luis Torres, spokesman for the committee overseeing the relief
effort, told The Associated Press that ``all the information is
being verified by the mayors' offices, the army, the police, public
and private rescue groups and the authorities of the 18 provinces
of the country.''
	   Federal authorities also announced Tuesday that they had
suspended Gov. Lucila Esperanza Barahona de Castro of the Santa
Barbara department near the Guatemala border after investigators
could verify only 282 of the 1,159 deaths reported in her area.
	   Authorities cited by the newspaper El Heraldo said the
suspension was standard procedure during an inquiry.
	   Barahona said she couldn't have falsified the numbers because
she didn't even give a death toll to the federal government.
	   ``I don't know what source gave them the numbers,'' she said.
	   In addition to the 5,657 dead, Honduras said it had verified
8,058 missing, 12,272 injured and 1.4 million homeless throughout
the country.

Iranian official, in Italy, says Washington not ready
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Iran's foreign minister on Tuesday said the United
States wasn't ready for relations with Tehran based on ``reciprocal
respect.''
	   Kamal Kharrazi, Tehran's top diplomat, gave his assessment while
talking to reporters at a forum in the northern Italian city of
Turin on Iranian-Italian relations.
	   The United States has had no diplomatic relations with Iran
since 1980, a year after Muslim fundamentalists overthrew the
pro-American Shah and overran the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, holding
Americans hostage for more than a year.
	   The U.S. State Department considers Iran a sponsor of terrorism,
but the Clinton administration is trying to capitalize on what it
sees as a strain of moderation in Tehran.
	   ``We don't accept relations which are aimed at eliminating our
freedom and independence. We are for equal relations and we think
that the United States isn't ready for this type of relations,''
the Italian news agency AGI quoted the Iranian minister as saying.
	   The ANSA news agency quoted Kharrazi as saying Tehran wanted
relations ``based on reciprocal respect.''
	   Iran, for now, ``doesn't need relations with the United
States,'' ANSA quoted him as saying.
	   On other international issues, the minister, slamming Israel,
said that any lasting peace in the Middle East must take into
consideration ``all the rights of the Palestinians,'' ANSA said.
	   And the Iranian also lashed out at Turkey as Italy debates what
to do about a detained Turkish Kurdish rebel leader whom Ankara has
accused of terrorism and wants extradited.
	   ``If peoples see their rights always respected, there would
never be any problems with them,'' Kharrazi was quoted as saying.

Kremlin wants to condemn Bolsheviks for 1917 revolution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An aide to President Boris Yeltsin urged
prosecutors Tuesday to investigate the Bolsheviks for carrying out
the 1917 revolution _ a move apparently intended to discourage
their successors.
	   Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff Yevgeny Savostyanov spoke at a
meeting of the presidential commission set up to fight political
extremism.
	   The prosecutors should give a ``legal assessment of the
Bolshevik action to seize power,'' Savostyanov was quoted by the
Interfax news agency as saying.
	   The statement reflected the government's concern about the
increasing aggressiveness of the Communist Party, which has the
largest faction in the Russian parliament and enjoys broad
nationwide support.
	   The Communists have also led a panel in parliament seeking to
impeach Yeltsin _ and among the charges they are investigating is
his role in instigating the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, the
Bolsheviks' creation.
	   In the latest embarrassment to the Kremlin, the Communists
recently won a sweeping victory in local elections in the southern
Krasnodar region.
	   Krasnodar Gov. Nikolai Kondratenko, a Communist, has often
indulged in anti-Semitic and anti-government rhetoric. Communist
lawmaker Albert Makashov similarly sparked a recent uproar with his
anti-Semitic remarks.
	   The Communist Party rebuked Makashov only grudgingly after
strong pressure in Russia and abroad. Makashov enjoys legal
immunity as a lawmaker, and the government hasn't yet moved to
persecute him.
	   Kondratenko, meanwhile, has been invited to the Justice Ministry
for a ``conversation,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Tuesday.
	   The presidential panel on Tuesday discussed possible amendments
to Russian laws to crack down on political extremism.

Report: Glycerin added to Barolo and Burgundy wines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss stores have withdrawn about
10,000 bottles of Barolo and Burgundy wines after they were found
to contain glycerin, Swiss television reported Tuesday.
	   Glycerin is used to improve the taste of poor quality produce.
Although it poses no health risk, it is banned to protect consumers
from being misled.
	   The Kassensturz (Cash Check) consumer program said it sent
samples of the quality wines, mostly costing more than 30 Swiss
francs (dlrs 21) per bottle, to a government laboratory for
testing.
	   Two out of five samples of French Burgundy wine and seven of 21
Barolo wines from northern Italy contained illegally added
glycerin, it said. One of the samples was ``Paolo Scavino,''
regarded as one of Italy's best wines.
	   Kassensturz said that wine dealers and the Coop supermarket
chain had withdrawn 10,000 bottles of the wine in question.

Helicopter rescues TV crew trapped on Arctic island
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ While snow squalls whipped across the desolate
Arctic landscape, a Russian helicopter emerged from the dusky
winter light Tuesday and rescued a TV crew that had been stranded
on a remote island for weeks by bad weather.
	   The three-man crew _ a Russian, a Japanese and an Australian who
had been making a documentary on polar bears _ had three days' food
left when the helicopter airlifted them from Wrangel Island to the
port of Pevek, the Ministry of Emergency Situations said.
	   They had waited for weeks for the skies to clear up enough so
that a helicopter could land. The temperature on Wrangel Island has
been around minus 22 degrees, and the Arctic days never get
brighter than twilight.
	   ``We were filming polar bears and other animals,'' Nikita
Ovsyannikov told Russian television channel NTV. ``On Oct. 15, we
completed the work, and a flight was ordered to take us back.''
	   ``But this year the weather conditions were very unusual: heavy,
long cyclones, the weather was constantly bad, with powerful
blizzards. So the flight couldn't arrive,'' he said.
	   The three then holed up in a cabin on the island's northeast
coast, about 350 miles west of Alaska.
	   Japanese crew member Tatsuhiko Kobayashi developed complications
from a recent eye operation, but the others were in good health,
Russia's ORT television reported.
	   Weather in Russia's Arctic has been particularly severe this
year. A nuclear-powered ice-breaking ship was stranded for several
days last week, unable to cut a channel for a Finnish tanker that
carried badly needed fuel to residents of Russia's northeast
Chukotka peninsula, not far from Wrangel Island.
	   ``It wasn't easy to find pilots,'' said Dean Finlay of the
emergency company AEA International SOS. ``Also, there was only a
three-hour daytime window in the area, and just over two hours of
flight time, so they had to get the window just right.''
	   It took the crew about an hour to load the 880 pounds of
equipment and film aboard. Then they traveled back in the already
black Arctic night.
	   ``It was an anxious couple of hours,'' said John Hyde, a
television producer who helped coordinate the rescue.
	   There were conflicting reports on who organized the rescue.
Emergency Situations Ministry spokesman Viktor Beltsov said the
rescue was organized by his agency using an Mi-8 helicopter hired
from a private airline.
	   But AEA International SOS said it had organized the rescue,
according to Mark Crawford, the company's spokesman in Australia.
He said his company had been hired by the filmmakers' employer,
Natural History Pty. Ltd., in New Zealand.
	   ``They're in fair spirits,'' Crawford said of the crew.
``They're surviving, of course, but they were down to their last
three days of food.''
	   Kobayashi is an employee of NHK, the Japanese television
company. The Australian is cameraman John McGuiness. All three crew
members were expected to fly to Moscow on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Emphasizing that peace meant tackling
the killer disease together, Israeli and Palestinian AIDS
campaigners handed out condoms and literature to passengers
departing Israel's international airport Tuesday.
	   Similar campaigns were held simultaneously at airports in Amman,
Jordan and Ankara, Turkey to mark World AIDS Day.
	   ``This disease knows no country, crosses every border and
strikes men, women and children of every nation, every age, every
culture,'' said U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna
Shalala, who arrived in Israel Tuesday.
	   ``It's a disease that is totally and completely out of control
in most of the world,'' she said. ``While those of us who have
large health budgets can afford to buy drugs to extend the lives of
our citizens, we do not have the resources to extend the lives of
everyone who has HIV-AIDS and therefore the search for a vaccine
and the emphasis on prevention is where we must go,'' Shalala told
The Associated Press.
	   In Israel, health ministry officials said there are 98 patients
with full blown AIDS and about 2,200 people who are HIV-positive.
However, the Israel AIDS Task Force which helped organized
Tuesday's campaigns in Israel, Turkey and Jordan, estimates real
figures could be four times as high.
	   In Jordan, more than 1,000 brochures on AIDS prevention
techniques were handed out to passengers at terminal gates at
Amman's Queen Alia International Airport.
	   Turkish President Suleyman Demirel who led his country's AIDS
campaign told a conference Tuesday that although there were
relatively few HIV cases in Turkey, much work was to be done in
order to protect a large population of youngsters from contracting
the disease.
	   He said there were 839 known cases of HIV infection in a country
of 62.5 million. ``This is just the tip of the iceberg,'' he said.
	   At Israel's international airport near Tel Aviv, Israeli women
dressed as yellow, blue and light green condoms combed the airport
together with Palestinian women wearing modest white head scarves
and passing out condoms, red ribbons, and collected charitable
donations for joint efforts in fighting the disease.
	   ``The peace process will start from these things. We are
together against AIDS.'' said Ibtisam Rizik, a Palestinian nurse.
	   Inon Schenker, executive director of the Jerusalem AIDS project
agreed. ``Because the HIV virus knows no borders, so we should know
no borders in fighting it.''
	   Shalala arrived in Israel together with her 91-year-old
Lebanese-born mother, Edna, who exchanged greetings with Israel's
health minister in Arabic.
	   Shalala will chair a two-day U.S.-Israel conference on women's
health opening Wednesday. During her four-day stay, she will also
hold meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
receive an honorary doctorate in philosophy from the University of
Haifa and tour Palestinian health facilities in the West Bank.

Italian power signs Romanian to replace Simoni
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Internazionale on Tuesday signed Romanian
Mircea Lucescu to replace Gigi Simoni as coach of the star-studded
but volatile Milan team through the end of the Italian Serie A
season in May.
	   Lucescu's hiring, for a reported 1 billion lire (dlrs 555,000),
was announced at Inter's training camp one day after the startling
dismissal of Simoni.
	   The Italian veteran was fired despite consecutive victories
which kept Inter in contention for the European Champions Cup and
Italian league titles.
	   Club president Massimo Moratti bitterly criticized Inter's play
following a 3-1 victory against defending champion Real Madrid in a
European Champions League game last Wednesday and an injury-time
2-1 victory against lightly regarded Salernitana in a league match
Sunday.
	   Inter, whose roster includes Ronaldo, Youri Djorkaeff, Roberto
Baggio, Diego Simeone and Ivan Zamorano, is in sixth place in the
Italian league with a 5-2-4 record and 17 points, five behind
league-leading Fiorentina.
	   Lucescu, a former Romanian national team coach and manager of
several club sides including Dynamo Bucharest and Italy's Brescia
and Reggiana, was presented to the Italian media at Appiano Gentile
Tuesday afternoon.
	   He then directed the first training session with Inter players
for Sunday's league match against Vicenza.
	   ``I will need time to change the team ... to switch to zone
defense and make the play more offensive,'' Lucescu said.
	   ``I'm convinced I did the right thing,'' Moratti said Tuesday.
``I think to have interpreted the feeling of our fans, who were
unhappy with the team play.''
	   Inter sold a record of 60,000 season tickets this year after it
won the UEFA Cup title and finished second to Juventus in the
Italian league last season.
	   Simoni, whose stay with Inter was stormy since the beginning of
his two-year contract, said Tuesday he was the victim of ``an
unfair, unexpected decision.''
	   Some Italian sports dailies suggested that Simoni paid for the
bad start of Brazilian superstar Ronaldo, who has been repeatedly
sidelined with tendinitis in his knee and failed to provide the
Milan team with the goals and play he produced last season.
	   Simoni also had been criticized frequently for his overly
defensive tactics.
	   Lucescu, 53, is expected by many to be an interim manager until
Italian Marcello Lippi can take over.
	   Lippi is rumored to ben leaving league champion Juventus of
Turin at the end of this season and could join Inter for the
1998-99 season. However, Moratti denied a decision for next season
has been make.
	   ``Lucescu can prove he deserves to coach a great team. He could
be a more lasting solution,'' Moratti said.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Spanish striker Raul Gonzalez scored with eight
minutes remaining and gave Real Madrid a 2-1 victory over Brazil's
Vasco da Gama on Tuesday night for its first Toyota Cup title since
1960.
	   Gonzalez settled Clarence Seedorf's pass before scoring, giving
Real the crown for the first time since it won the inaugural trophy
38 years ago.
	   It was the fourth straight victory and 17th overall for Europe
in the annual battle against South America for what is considered
the world club championship. South America's Copa Libertadores
champions still hold the edge, having won 20 of the 37 titles.
	   ``We are very pleased to win the title,'' Real manager Guus
Hiddink said. ``We thought we could play well in general.''
	   Playing before more than 51,000 spectators at Tokyo's National
Stadium, Vasco da Gama's Nasa gave Real Madrid the lead in the 25th
minute, trying to head away Roberto Carlos' cross at the penalty
spot but instead putting it in his own net.
	   It took 19 minutes before Vasco could equalize when Juninho
scored after Real Madrid goalkeeper Bodo Illgner fumbled the a shot
by Ramon.
	   Vasco, making its first appearance in the Toyota Cup in
centennial year, threatened repeatedly but were thwarted by
Illgner.
	   Raul broke the deadlock but controlling a long pass from Seedorf
in the penalty area, eluding two defenders in front of the net and
beating Vasco keeper Germany.
	   ``We had a several chances in the second half, but we couldn't
make it while the other (Real Madrid) made a few chance for the
goal,'' Vasco manager Antonio Lopez said.
	   Gonzalez, who scored a dramatic goal on a left-footed volley in
a 3-2 World Cup loss to Nigeria in Spain's opener at France, was
named the game's most valuable player for Tuesday's effot, receive
an Altezza car from title sponsor Toyota.
	   ``Everybody wants to score a goal in a final,'' said the
21-year-old Raul, now in his fourth season with Real. ``Today we
played more like a team, and that's why we won.''

U.N. sends 2,500 tons of relief aid to southern civilians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMED OSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The United Nations World Food Program has
sent some 2,500 tons of relief aid for hungry civilians in war-torn
southern Sudan, a U.N. official said Tuesday.
	   A convoy of seven river barges carrying relief material left the
river port of Kosti, 300 kilometers (miles 195) south of Khartoum,
on Monday to distribute the aid to people along the Nile river, the
WFP representative in Khartoum, Mohammed Saleheen, said in a
statement.
	   ``The barges' convoy is the lifeline for half a million hungry
people along the Nile river corridor,'' the statement said.
	   It said WFP teams will distribute relief to some 33 locations
under government and rebel control until the convoy reaches the
southern strategic town of Juba early January.
	   Juba, a provincial capital about 1,200 kilometers (744 miles)
south of the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, is the largest town in
southern Sudan still under government control.
	   Saleheen said the WFP intends to send more aid in the coming
months via the Nile as it is much cheaper than air transport.
	   The WFP used to drop 9,500 tons of food a month at a cost of
dlrs 30 million into the south in the world's largest aid
operation.
	   Aid workers estimate about 1.5 million people are facing severe
food shortages in southern Sudan, mainly in Bahr el-Ghazal
province, as a result of drought and fighting.
	   The government and the rebels agreed in October to extend by
three months a cease-fire to allow food to reach civilians caught
in the war with the rebels in the south.
	   Sudan has been embroiled in a civil war for 15 years, pitting
Christian and animist rebels fighting for more autonomy against the
government in the Muslim, Arab north. About 1.5 million people have
died in the war and famines caused by the fighting.

Kremlin says Yeltsin improving, still in hospital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new grafs 6-9 with doctor's comments, Camdessus
arriving. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin is feeling better, but is
still spending part of the day in a hospital bed as he continues to
be treated for pneumonia, officials said Tuesday.
	   A Kremlin spokesman said the president was doing limited
paperwork and there were no plans for any meetings or visitors. He
did not say how much longer Yeltsin would remain in the government
hospital where he has been for 10 days.
	   Yeltsin's first deputy chief of staff Oleg Sysuyev said Tuesday
that the president is expected to return to work at the Kremlin
``in the nearest time.''
	   ``Doctors are having trouble keeping the president in the
hospital,'' Sysuyev said at a news conference.
	   The 67-year-old leader is known as a restless patient who
sometimes ignores the advice of his doctors.
	   Dr. Renat Akchurin, who had conducted Yeltsin's heart bypass
surgery two years ago, said the president's repeated illnesses may
be due to a weakened immune system.
	   Akchurin said that he has not examined Yeltsin for eight months
but said heart problems appeared unlikely, according to an
interview with the weekly Argumenty i Fakty, cited by the Interfax
news agency. He also dismissed speculation that his heart surgery
had affected the president's brain.
	   Yeltsin met his chief-of-staff Valentin Yumashev in the hospital
Monday and was briefed on government and national affairs.
	   On Tuesday, the president spoke by telephone with Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov to discuss the agenda of the premier's talks with
International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus, who arrived in
Moscow later on Tuesday.
	   Russian television showed brief footage of Yeltsin, dressed in a
white shirt and dark cardigan and looking pale, listening intently
to his aide and nodding periodically. Like most footage of Yeltsin
released in recent weeks, Monday's tape didn't contain any sound of
the president speaking.
	   Yeltsin's repeated illnesses and his infrequent public
appearances have raised concerns about his ability to lead the
country _ now mired in its worst economic crisis since the 1991
Soviet collapse _ through the end of his term in mid-2000.
	   Sysuyev reiterated on Tuesday that Yeltsin will concentrate on
political matters, leaving day-to-day management of economic
matters to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov. ``You shouldn't think
that the president and his office aren't taking part and
controlling the economic developments, such as preparing next
year's budget and tax reform,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin has remained out of public view throughout the latest
economic crisis that hit in mid-August, further eroding his sagging
popularity.
	   ``It's known that the president now doesn't have sufficiently
high popularity, to put it mildly,'' Sysuyev said, according to the
Interfax news agency. He insisted, however, that the president
continues to play a stabilizing role in Russian society, blunting
antagonism between different political forces.

Russian prime minister lobbies IMF chief for more loans

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With a dlrs 22.6 billion loan for Russia hanging
in limbo, International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus
launched a new round of talks in Moscow on Tuesday on freeing up
the money.
	   Yet Russia's government continued to put off tough financial
decisions the IMF says are necessary for releasing the rest of the
frozen loan, and Camdessus was not expected to announce any
breakthroughs.
	   Camdessus met Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Tuesday night
and is scheduled to hold broader talks with government officials
Wednesday.
	   ``I want to get better acquainted with the prime minister,''
Camdessus told reporters upon arrival Tuesday night. ``I presume we
will be having interesting conversations.''
	   Russia, facing mounting debts to workers, pensioners and foreign
creditors, is seeking further installments on a dlrs 22.6 billion
IMF-led bailout package reached in the summer. The loan was frozen
after Russia succumbed to the Asian economic crisis and devalued
the ruble and defaulted on some of its debts in August.
	   Russia has so far received only about dlrs 5 billion of the
bailout package, which also involves the World Bank and the
Japanese government.
	   The IMF has said the government must come up with a realistic
recovery plan before more money will be released.
	   An IMF mission left town last week saying the government's
revenue forecast for next year was overly optimistic. It also
disapproved of the government's intention to lower taxes and offer
subsidies to ailing industries.
	   If the Russian government doesn't receive foreign help soon, it
will probably have to start printing money, which would drive up
inflation.
	   ``I hope that the IMF would be able to make a decision to
provide aid to Russia that would allow us to avoid
hyperinflation,'' Oleg Sysuyev, a top presidential aide, told a
news conference Tuesday.
	   The government has been delaying a debate on next year's budget
as it struggles to find ways to come up with enough money to meet
its expenses. The Cabinet again postponed the discussion this week,
but insisted the delay was not connected with Camdessus' visit.
	   However, Russian media have suggested the government put off
action on the budget because it is still hoping for the IMF loans.
The latest draft assumes Russia will receive the IMF money.
	   ``Everyone understands that budget parameters remain vague, and
their clarification depends on Camdessus' visit,'' the business
daily Kommersant said Tuesday.
	   Sysuyev, meanwhile, reiterated that President Boris Yeltsin will
leave day-to-day management of economic matters to Primakov.
	   ``The new reality is that these matters are now dealt with by
the government,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin, who is in the hospital receiving treatment for
pneumonia, discussed with Primakov by telephone Tuesday the
government's stance at the talks with Camdessus.

Sharp drops on European exchanges after Wall Street, Asian dips
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with closing indexes; style on Tether-and-Greenwood
uses ampersand &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Asian Markets-Stocks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Share prices dropped sharply on European stock
exchanges Tuesday in a swirl of gloom and profit-taking, following
big falls on Wall Street and in Asian markets.
	   The London Stock Exchange, Europe's largest, set the pace with a
fall of 3.6 percent on the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index.
	   ``We have seen quite a rally in the last week or so, but
investors are nervous,'' said Tessa Kohn-Speyer, investment analyst
at Barclays Stockbrokers in London. ``There has been a lot of
speculation that the market will fall back again so they have been
trying to cash in on profits today.''
	   Key indexes were down 5.0 percent in Germany, 4.2 percent in
Milan and Zurich, 4.0 percent in Paris, 5.2 percent in Moscow, 6.1
percent in Budapest, 4.7 percent in Amsterdam, 3.4 percent in Oslo,
3.2 percent in Dublin and Madrid, 2.7 percent Stockholm, 2.1
percent in Prague and 1.3 percent in Copenhagen.
	   ``There was just nothing supportive out there,'' said Peter
Caulkett of Teather-and-Greenwood in London. ``But there is a
feeling that stocks had come up too far too soon and investors are
now running scared.''
	   Dmitry Kulyashenits, trader at Moscow investment bank MFK
Renaissance, commented, ``There was profit-taking everywhere.
Russia wasn't an exception.''
	   On Wall Street Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.3
percent in the first big wave of profit-taking since the market
recovered strongly two months ago. The New York market steadied in
morning trading Thursday, with the Dow Jones index down 0.3
percent.
	   Asian markets had followed New York's lead, with Hong Kong's
Hang Seng Index down 4.1 percent Tuesday, and Singapore's Straits
Times Index off 3.4 percent. Tokyo was an exception, with a mild
0.3 percent decline in the Nikkei 225-stock average.
	   Local concerns contributed to the drops on some European
exchanges.
	   Analysts in Frankfurt said the declines in German stock prices
partly reflected disappointment with Deutsche Bank's announcement
that it expected no immediate savings from its takeover of Bankers
Trust, a U.S. investment bank.
	   In Paris the CAC-40 index was down 4.0 percent, led by 12.0
percent plunge in shares of Total. Investors deserted the petroleum
company after it announced it was getting back into the refinery
sector by acquiring Petrofina of Belgium.
	   Ironically, Petrofina shares soared 18 percent on the Brussels
exchange.
	   The Swiss Market Index was 2.7 lower, in part because of
profit-taking in the financial sector and a switch toward buying
pharmaceutical stocks.

Mayor, new Bengal get acquainted

<TEXT>
	   ALBUQUERQUE (AP) _ Mayor Jim Baca says Lucy is the first visitor
he's ever had who was content to munch on an old running shoe.
	   The mayor on Monday met the 10-week-old Bengal tiger cub who,
along with another Bengal cub, 6-month-old Scout, are on loan for a
year to the Rio Grande Zoo.
	   For right now, Lucy is being hand-raised by keeper Linda McNatt
until she's big enough to defend herself from Scout.
	   The playful cub was a hit at Baca's 11th floor City Hall office,
where she sat calmly on his lap to have her photo taken while
Baca's staff ooohed and aahed from afar. She also romped through
the office, gnawing on an old tennis shoe.
	   ``I love tigers,'' the mayor said. ``They're such magnificent
animals.''
	   Lucy also seemed to take to him.
	   ``She hasn't been that calm with anybody,'' said Kent Newton,
assistant zoo director.
	   Lucy is earning her keep as an ambassador for her kind in the
wild.
	   ``It's good to use her for educational purposes because people
really do pay attention when you walk in the room with a tiger,''
McNatt said.
	   The cub is not on exhibit yet, but Scout is, occupying an area
where the zoo once had white Bengal tigers. The white tigers
recently were sent to Wildlife World Zoo outside of Phoenix.
	   ``They were a pleasure for the public to see when we first
brought them in, but that excitement has waned,'' Newton said.
	   White Bengals also aren't as valuable genetically because they
are a genetic anomaly and somewhat inbred, he said.
	   When the Bengal cubs leave, the zoo hopes to bring in endangered
Amur tigers, also known as Siberian tigers, for breeding. There are
only about 440 to 500 Amur tigers left in the wild, in two or three
populations in their natural range of far eastern Russia and
northeastern China.
	   ``Siberian tigers are critically endangered so there is a need
to breed them in captivity as a hedge against extinction,'' Newton
said.
	   ``They're beautiful and huge and wonderful for the people to
see, but in addition we will be contributing to the preservation of
that species,'' he said.

Colombian guerrilla negotiator: We will not lay down our arms

	   LA MACHACA, Colombia (AP) _ Colombian rebels have no intention
of giving up their weapons if a peace accord is reached with
President Andres Pastrana's government, a top guerrilla negotiator
says.
	   ``The government knows that we're not going to surrender our
weapons,'' said Joaquin Gomez, one of three subcomandanders
representing the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC,
in a peace dialogue that has yet to begin.
	   ``They are talking with us because we have them, and these same
weapons will be a guarantee afterwards that the agreements are
carried out,'' Gomez, 51-year-old chief of the FARC's southern
military bloc, told foreign correspondents on Monday in this remote
southern hamlet.
	   The government has not set any conditions for the talks, though
Pastrana has appealed for a truce, at least through the Christmas
and New Year's holiday.
	   The rebels have refused to halt hostilities, however, and three
soldiers and one police officer were killed in separate rebel
attacks in northwestern Colombia, authorities said.
	   Accompanied by a dozen bodyguards, Gomez arrived in La Machaca,
which is little more than a cluster of huts along a dirt road,
driving a green Ford sport utility vehicle. His fellow spokesman,
33-year-old Fabian Ramirez, came in another vehicle and sported a
Che Guevara wristwatch. The reporters, arriving from the other
direction, had to first clear a rebel checkpoint.
	   Gomez said the FARC still does not consider that Pastrana has
honored his promise to remove all soldiers from a
42,000-square-kilometer (16,200-square-mile) swath of southern
Colombia including La Machaca where the peace talks are to take
place. Until the pullout is complete, the former university
lecturer added, there will be no talks.
	   Pastrana says the more than 100 soldiers that remain at a
military base in nearby San Vicente del Caguan, the largest town in
the pullout zone, are unarmed and are there to support government
negotiators.
	   But the FARC insists the soldiers be removed, and Ramirez over
the weekend accused the army of plotting to assassinate the group's
70-year-old commander, Manuel Marulanda, who founded the
hemisphere's oldest and largest rebel band 34 years ago.
	   Nearly a month has passed since the government pullout was
supposed to be complete, and Gomez said ``the balance is not
encouraging because they have not withdrawn.''
	   The rebel negotiators' next scheduled meeting with Pastrana's
peace commissioner is set for Dec. 11.
	   Meanwhile, more than 400 kilometers (250 miles) away, three
soldiers were killed in an ambush by rebels of the National
Liberation Army, or ELN, the country's second-largest guerrilla
force, the army said.
	   The soldiers had arrived to help a besieged police post in
Cocorna, Antioquia state, which a column of about 100 ELN fighters
attacked Monday evening, said deputy police commander Gen. Alfredo
Salgado. He said two police officers were wounded and seven missing
and possibly captured.
	   In a separate action, FARC fighters attacked a police post early
Tuesday in San Francisco, a town near Cocorna 180 kilometers (110
miles) northwest of Bogota, killing one police officer and wounding
six, Salgado said.
	   He said communications were lost with the town.

Europe needs more independent defense, British defense secretary
</HEADLINE>
says
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Europe needs to build up its own defense to put
muscle behind its foreign policy and prepare for the day Washington
won't lead in a crisis, Britain's defense secretary said Tuesday.
	   ``If Europe is to have a stronger voice in the world, then
European armed forces will need to be capable of supporting that
position,'' George Robertson told the Paris assembly of the Western
European Union, the EU's fledgling defense arm.
	   Among other crises, ``Kosovo, although not solely a European
problem, has shown that there is more that Europe could do to show
unity of resolve,'' Robertson said.
	   ``We are keen to enhance the Europeans' capability to act when
our North American Allies are not engaged,'' he added.
	   The speech appeared to lend support to France's drive for an
independent European defense, starting with a European pillar
within NATO. But Robertson also stated clearly that the U.S.-led
alliance ``will remain the cornerstone of European security and
defense.''
	   As a condition to fully rejoining NATO's integrated command,
France has insisted NATO's Southern Command in Naples should go to
a European. The United States, whose Sixth Fleet is part of the
command, has rejected the idea.
	   Robertson also opposed giving the 15-nation European Union's
executive or parliament ``a direct role in defense matters. Defense
must remain intergovernmental, and defense decisions must continue
to be made by consensus.''
	   Still, the British defense secretary said Europe needs to boost
its role in NATO.
	   With more than 60 percent of the alliance's population and
nearly two-thirds of its military personnel, European allies
provide only 40 percent of the total defense spending, he noted.
	   ``Developing Europe's capabilities will strengthen the alliance,
not undermine it, and respond to aspirations on both sides of the
Atlantic,'' he said.
	   Robertson also pushed European defense industries to
consolidate, ``particularly when facing the twin pressures of large
rationalized American companies and reduced defense spending.''
	   The statement put pressure on France's state-owned Aerospatiale,
whose reluctance to privatize quickly has held up an alliance with
private British and German companies.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Chile's foreign minister said Tuesday that
his government is considering legal action against Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, but ruled out a deal guaranteeing he'd stand trial at
home if Britain rejects an extradition request from Spain.
	   The minister, Jose Miguel Insulza, has argued that it is
unnecessary to try Pinochet in Spain for crimes committed during
his 1973-1990 dictatorship. A government lawsuit would strengthen
his case.
	   ``The government is studying whether to join existing suits,''
filed this year in Chile, Insulza said. ``The possibility of a
trial in Chile exists and gets larger every day.''
	   Human rights activists have dismissed the possibility of a
Chilean trial for the former dictator since has wide-ranging
immunity at home.
	   A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared at the hands of the police after Pinochet seized power
in a military coup that toppled the democratically elected
president, Salvador Allende.
	   Chile, Insulza said, was ``under no obligation'' to promise that
the 83-year-old retired general would stand trial if allowed home
from London, where he has been under police guard since being
detained Oct. 16 while recuperating from back surgery.
	   Insulza insisted that a Spanish judge's attempt to extradite
Pinochet on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture was an
affront to Chilean sovereignty and its transition to democracy.
	   According to Insulza, who is pressing for Pinochet's release,
Chile should be allowed to deal with the legacy of general's 17
years in power without interference.
	   Pinochet has many supporters, there is widespread fear of
violence if he is prosecuted.
	   ``There is no reason to call into doubt the solidity of
democracy in Chile or our capacity to resolve our own problems,''
Insulza said, after stressing that the affair had triggered
``polarization, break down of dialogue and sharp political
confrontation.''
	   Spain's foreign minister, Abel Matutes, said the Spanish
government was powerless to act, since all remaining decisions on
Pinochet's fate were in British hands. Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar reiterated that message in a 40-minute meeting, Europe Press
reported, quoting government officials.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Insulza met Supreme Court Deputy President Luis
Lopez and Senate President Juan Ignacio Barrero.
	   Prior to arriving Monday in Madrid, Insulza spent four days
lobbying the British government whose Home Secretary, Jack Straw,
has until Dec. 11 to decide whether to let extradition proceedings
go ahead.
	   Insulza said his trip had produced ``some positive indications''
but he declined to give details.
	   He was to meet Spanish business leaders before leaving for Chile
on a Tuesday night flight.

Customs officers in Cameroon seize ivory, heroin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) _ Customs inspectors at Cameroon's main
international airport seized 11 elephant tusks from two Chinese
businessmen, the chief customs officer said Tuesday.
	   The ivory tusks were discovered in the bags of the two men, who
were detained briefly and then permitted to travel onward from
Cameroon's main commercial hub of Douala to Paris on Tuesday.
	   There is a worldwide ban on the sale and export of ivory,
although penalties for violators vary significantly from country to
country.
	   In an unrelated incident, a Nigerian man was arrested and
charged with drug smuggling after he was found with sealed capsules
of heroin in his stomach.
	   The heroin, worth several thousand dollars, was destined for
Nigeria, said Chief Customs Inspector Joseph Moulela.
	   The Nigerian, John Chukwudi Amobi, could face up to 10 years in
jail if convicted in a Cameroonian court on drug smuggling charges.
	   Douala has become a transit point for drug shipments that
ultimately head to Europe, Douala International Airport Commandant
Fabien Mballa Toulou.
	   In recent weeks concealed packages of heroin destined for Douala
have been seized in the Pakistani port city of Karachi, he said.

<TEXT>
	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ Hezbollah guerrillas carried out four
attacks Tuesday against Israeli and allied militiamen in south
Lebanon, killing one fighter, security officials said.
	   The victim was a member of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon
Army, who was killed in an explosion outside the town of Jezzine,
said the officials.
	   Another explosion in Jezzine, 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of
Israel's panhandle, wounded another SLA militiaman, said the
officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Guerrillas also targeted joint SLA-Israeli military positions in
the Lebanese villages of Blatt and Sojod, both about 500 meters
(yards) north of the Israeli border. No casualties were reported,
said the Lebanese officials.
	   They confirmed the attacks were carried out by Hezbollah.
	   The Shiite Muslim movement Hezbollah, or Party of God, said in
statements its guerrillas targeted outposts belonging to SLA and
Israeli troops in the central and western sectors of an
Israeli-occupied enclave in South Lebanon.
	   The attacks came amid mounting tension in Lebanon. Israel has
threatened to bomb the capital, Beirut, to avenge the deaths of
Israeli soldiers. Seven Israelis have been killed by guerrillas in
south Lebanon since mid-November.
	   Hezbollah, of the Party of God, is leading a guerrilla battle to
oust the SLA and Israeli soldiers from an enclave that Israel has
occupied in south Lebanon since 1985.
	   Israel claims the occupation is needed to protect its northern
towns from attack, but the frequent deaths of Israeli soldiers in
south Lebanon has raised debate in Israel about maintaining the
occupation.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union finance ministers failed
Tuesday to narrow differences over how to pay for plans to bring up
to 12 new members into the Union over the coming decade.
	   British, French and German ministers said there was growing
support for plans to freeze EU spending up to 2006 around current
levels of 85 billion European currency units (dlrs 100 billion) a
year.
	   But less well off EU members _ Spain, Portugal, Greece and
Ireland _ are seeking an increase in spending to ensure they don't
lose out when even poorer nations in central and eastern Europe
join the club.
	   ``It is a difficult area, sufficient progress has not been
made,'' said Austrian Finance Minister Rudolf Edlinger, who chaired
the day-long meeting.
	   The finance ministers had hoped to draw up guidelines on the
budget debate to the leaders of the 15 EU nations who hold their
year-end summit next week in Vienna.
	   Although the leaders are hoping to move the issue forward in the
Austrian capital, they have set a deadline of next Spring to
overhaul the budget.
	   Complicating the question are demands by Germany, the
Netherlands, Austria and Sweden for a reduction in their membership
dues to the EU.

Rail workers to continue strike for sixth day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French train travelers faced another day of
widespread disruptions after rail workers voted Tuesday to extend
their five-day-old strike.
	   Unions voted to continue the walkout in 18 of 23 regions,
sparing only Brittany and parts of northern France. The state-run
train company, the SNCF, said an average of one in three trains
would run on Wednesday.
	   According to the SUD-Rail union, 70 to 80 percent of the
country's ticket inspectors are continuing to strike.
	   The Eurostar train to London, however, will remain unaffected by
the walkout, as will the Thalys train from Paris to Brussels,
Amsterdam and Cologne.
	   Rail workers, in particular ticket inspectors, are protesting
what they see as insufficient staff. They are also concerned about
how the government will implement a plan to cut the workweek from
39 to 35 hours.
	   The ticket inspectors have complained that a lack of employees
has created a safety problem for workers and travelers.
	   The SNCF said Tuesday it would hold a national meeting Dec. 7
and 8 to address train workers' concerns.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Activists across the globe
marched in the streets, distributed condoms and held benefit
concerts Tuesday to try to halt the spread of AIDS, which will kill
millions of people this year alone.
	   Underscoring events on World AIDS Day was this sobering fact:
Although powerful new medicines are helping industrialized
countries win the battle against the disease, it has reached
epidemic proportions in continents where people can't afford the
drugs.
	   About 33.4 million people around the world are infected with
HIV, two-thirds of them in sub-Saharan Africa. In Asia and the
Pacific, 700,000 people become infected with HIV per year.
	   In sub-Saharan Africa, the 1998 death toll from AIDS is expected
to be 2 million. Nearly 6 million more people will become infected
this year _ 1.7 million of them in sub-Saharan Africa.
	   ``In the case of HIV/AIDS, the difference in wealth becomes
literally matter of life and death,'' decried Mary Robinson, the
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.
	   From bars in Hong Kong to parks in South Africa, activists
preached safe sex. People pinned red ribbons on lapels to express
solidarity in the fight against AIDS.
	   _ In India, where up to 5 million people are HIV positive,
hundreds of schoolchildren marched beside prostitutes in New Delhi
to draw attention to the epidemic.
	   _Israelis and Palestinians handed out condoms and literature to
passengers departing Israel's international airport in Tel Aviv.
	   _ In Ivory Coast, thousands of children wearing T-shirts with
anti-AIDS slogans and bouncing inflated condoms like beach balls
marched through the streets of Abidjan.
	   _ In Kenya, children wearing black T-Shirts that said ``Stop
AIDS'' distributed condoms and pamphlets on AIDS prevention in
Dandora, an eastern Nairobi slum.
	   _ In Hong Kong's nightspots, activists handed out coasters with
pictures of a condom on one side and a safe-sex message on the
other.
	   _ In Tokyo, Japan's Health Ministry held rallies and concerts in
a central square.
	   _ In Moscow, a contraceptive company's employees sheathed in
red, yellow or green ``condom suits'' handed out condoms in Pushkin
Square.
	   _ In Pretoria, South Africa, clowns painted red AIDS ribbons on
people's faces as drum majorettes entertained a crowd.
	   Underneath it all was a life-and-death message: Practice safe
sex of face the consequences.
	   ``Come and witness the reality of AIDS. See the devastation in
our community. See the fresh graves,'' South African President
Nelson Mandela told hundreds of people in a village in
KwaZulu-Natal province, where an estimated 25 percent of adults are
infected with HIV.
	   But considering the enormity of the problem, the call to action
worldwide was muted.
	   In some countries like Zimbabwe, where an estimated 23 percent
of the population is infected with HIV, World AIDS day passed with
little fanfare. Countries in southern Africa have been slow to
recognize the unfolding tragedy and have little resources to fight
it.
	   It was only in October that the South African government
launched an AIDS awareness program. Already, more than 3 million
South Africans are infected. This year an estimated 168,000 have
died from AIDS.
	   The vast majority of those infected in Africa and other
developing regions cannot afford the drugs that are prolonging life
among AIDS patients in the West.
	   In Washington, President Bill Clinton announced dlrs 10 million
in emergency grants to help children orphaned by AIDS in poorer
nations. Much more assistance would be needed to help turn the
tide.
	   Robinson, the top human rights official at the U.N., said: ``The
current situation is an indictment of the international allocation
of resources to fight HIV/AIDS in developing nations.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
Authority on Tuesday disputed a published report asserting it had
spent money earmarked for low-income housing on luxury apartments
for wealthy Arafat associates.
	   ``I don't see any corruption in housing,'' Palestinian Housing
Minister Abdel Rahman Hamad said in response to a report in the
Sunday Times of London.
	   The report came a day before a Washington conference of
international donors at which more than 43 nations pledged a total
of more than dlrs 3 billion in aid to the Palestinians.
	   Palestinian officials feared the allegations, coupled with
previous findings of corruption, would dampen enthusiasm for
providing aid.
	   At a news conference, the Palestinian housing minister said
low-income Palestinians were indeed the chief beneficiaries of
subsidized housing in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   He said 90 percent of the buyers of 922 European Union-funded
housing units in Gaza had incomes of less than dlrs 600 a month.
	   He acknowledged that buyers did include some Arafat associates
who returned from exile with the start of Palestinian autonomy in
the Gaza Strip.
	   But he said the application process for purchasing the units had
been open to all, and that apartment sales were carried out under
joint EU supervision.
	   Hamad also called the newspaper's description of luxury features
at some of the EU-funded apartments unfair. He said the units were
built according to simple, basic specifications, and that extras
like satellite dishes and custom-styling came at the expense of
individual owners.
	   The report also suggested that the units were unusually
spacious, but the housing minister said their size _ 90 to 100
square meters _ was normal for Palestinian families, which tend to
be large.
	   Of those living in housing built with European Union backing in
Gaza, Hamad said 136 were unemployed, 193 worked in the private
sector, 55 were employed by non-governmental organizations, 48
worked for the United Nations, 189 worked for civilian ministries
in the Palestinian Authority and 301 were employed by the
Palestinian security forces.
	   At the donor conference, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said disbursement of American funds would be closely
monitored. Hamad said the Palestinians welcomed the scrutiny.
	   ``We don't want donors to use this (worry over corruption) as an
excuse not to provide aid,'' he said.

 &UR; High-tech reveals pharaonic capital in Nile Delta
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Using magnetic sensors and computers,
Egyptian experts have located and mapped an important pharaonic
city in the Nile Delta, officials said Tuesday.
	   Ahmed Gouda Husain of the Geophysical Research Center said the
experts have been able to create detailed images of Qantir, which
was a capital of one of Egypt's most famous kings, Ramses II.
	   Ramses II, a pharaoh in the so-called New Kingdom era, ruled
Egypt from 1304 to 1237 B.C.
	   ``It's a complete town with all its palaces, houses, streets and
stables,'' Husain told The Associated Press.
	   Husain said the team he heads has been using magnetic sensors to
survey the city, which also served as the capital of the Hyksos
invaders for nearly a hundred years.
	   He said that surveying the city _ covering a square kilometer
(about half a square mile) of cotton, corn and wheat fields _ took
about 45 days.
	   The team used a piece of equipment known as a ``graduometre,''
which was provided by a German foundation, to measure electric
impulses and magnetic levels at the site, Husain said.
	   Husain, a geophysicist who has been working in archaeology for
15 years, said the team later put the readings into a computer to
generate images of the city.
	   Qantir, some 114 kilometers (76 miles) north of Cairo, is
covered with sandy mounds that archaeologists believe cover a
number of pharaonic sites.
	   Gaballah Ali Gaballah, head of Egypt's Supreme Council for
Antiquities, said the site was discovered in the 1920s. He said it
would require at least 20 years of excavations to unearth the main
sections of the city.
	   Husain said his team has used high-tech equipment to make a
number of important archaeological discoveries in Egypt.
	   In Sohag in the south, for example, they found tombs and 12
buried solar boats, designed to carry the dead in their after
lives.

IMF mission arrives in Ukraine to discuss next loan tranche
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ An International Monetary Fund mission
arrived in Ukraine on Tuesday for a four-day visit to check whether
the former Soviet republic was meeting conditions for the next
tranche of a dlrs 2.2 billion loan.
	   The visit of the IMF team, headed by Mohammed Shadman-Valavi,
follows that of another IMF delegation last month. That mission
left without announcing whether Ukraine qualified for the next loan
installment.
	   It also comes as the leftist-dominated parliament gears up for
battles with the government over the Cabinet's 1999 budget draft,
which forecasts a slight economic growth and a tiny deficit _ 0.6
percent. The document is due to be discussed in the first reading
this week.
	   Many in parliament want more spending on social needs, which
might not be to the IMF's liking.
	   The IMF suspended cooperation with Ukraine last spring to show
displeasure with the country's slow pace of economic reforms. But
in September, the fund announced that it was satisfied with
Cabinet's reform steps and approved the three-year aid package of
dlrs 2.2 billion.
	   Kiev already has received about dlrs 340 million of the loan.
Approval of each new installment is conditioned on Ukraine's
sticking to its projected budget deficit, inflation and foreign
currency reserves.
	   The IMF has expressed concerns over the government's persistent
failure to raise enough budget revenues, and said reforms in the
key sectors of economy _ energy and agriculture _ and
administrative reform were going too slowly.
	   The fund has also sharply criticized Ukraine's proposals to
print money to pay off some government debts.
	   Ukraine's government is caught in a vicious circle of
non-payments. It is owed over 9 billion hryvna (dlrs 2.6 billion)
in unpaid taxes, while its own debt in unpaid pensions and wages
totals more than 3 billion hryvna (dlrs 875 million).
	   IMF officials say Ukraine's overall economic situation has
become more complex since the loan was approved.
	   They have noted that the credibility of Ukraine's financial
market has been undermined by the economic crisis in Russia, and
Ukraine's economic development could slow, with a possible gross
domestic product decline.
	   Ukrainian leaders, meanwhile, have urged the fund to soften its
lending conditions, especially those concerning tax collection and
social welfare payments, saying the cash-poor government was
unlikely to implement them.
	   Still, Ukraine's National Bank chairman, Viktor Yushchenko,
voiced hopes last week that the talks would be successful, adding
that the sides were working on possible revisions to the loan deal.
	   Ukraine maintains it needs foreign aid to repay a mounting
foreign debt before it can improve tax collection and introduce
reforms needed to boost economic growth.

Canada selects Vancouver-Whistler to bid for 2010 Winter Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Vancouver and the nearby ski resort of Whistler
have been chosen as Canada's candidate to bid for the 2010 Winter
Olympics, the Canadian Olympic Association announced Tuesday.
	   Voting by 72 delegates actually took place Nov. 21 in a
three-way race involving Vancouver-Whistler, Quebec City and
Calgary, Alberta, host of the 1988 Winter Games.
	   But the Olympic association delayed announcing the results until
a day after Monday's provincial election in Quebec. There was
unspoken concern that rejection of Quebec City's bid might trigger
a backlash among voters choosing between separatist and
anti-separatist parties.
	   Vancouver-Whistler led the first ballot with 26 votes, one ahead
of Quebec City. Calgary dropped off the ballot after getting 21
votes.
	   The Vancouver bid took the second ballot 40-31.
	   Vancouver-Whistler was considered the front-runner because many
Canadian Olympic officials believed it had the best chance of
winning the 2010 bid.
	   Toronto, meanwhile, is bidding for 2008 Summer Olympics.
	   A successful Toronto bid would deal a death blow to
Vancouver-Whistler's chances because it is considered very unlikely
Canada would be selected or want to host consecutive Olympics.
Beijing is now considered the 2008 frontrunner.
	   The International Olympic Committee will choose the 2010 host
city in 2003.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet left
a north London psychiatric hospital Tuesday, driven away to an
undisclosed destination in an ambulance in a covoy headed by police
vehicles.
	   The ambulance swept through the gates of Grovelands Priory a day
after the hospital announced that the 83-year-old general did not
need medical care, and demanded that he leave.
	   The move by the hospital, where Pinochet has been since Oct. 29,
dealt a blow to any plan he had to plead he is too ill to be
extradited to Spain to stand trial on charges of genocide and
torture.

Greens call for a lifting of the ban on Kurdish rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with interior minister opposing ban &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Interior Minister Otto Schily said Tuesday
that Germany must keep its ban on the Kurdistan Workers Party, or
PKK, because of the rebel group's potential for violence.
	   Schily's comments followed an appeal by a Greens politician
Angela Beers, who argued that the 1993 ban has increased tensions
between Germany's Turkish and Kurdish residents.
	   She urged Germany's new government to lift the ban and to use
the opportunity created by the arrest of Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan to push for a political solution in Turkey, where
PKK guerrillas have been fighting for a homeland since 1984.
	   Ocalan was arrested in Italy on a German warrant, but Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder has refused to seek his extradition, citing fears
that a trial in Germany would lead to unrest.
	   Beers also said the ban has given Turkey justification for its
actions against the Kurdish population, which has in turn fueled
tensions in Turkey and Germany. About 400,000 Kurds are among
Germany's 2 million Turkish residents.
	   She and lawmaker Ulla Jelpke of the ex-communist Party of
Democratic Socialists are backing an initiative by the Kurdistan
Information Center in Cologne, which has collected 10,000
signatures to lift the PKK ban.
	   The Interior Minister ruled out lifting the ban, saying that
many PKK rebels have been convicted of terror crimes and the group
uses violence to extort financial donations.
	   ``The PKK is an organization in which hides an incalculable,
militant potential for danger,'' Schily said.
	   The opposition Christian Democrats agreed, saying lifting the
ban would be ``playing with fire.''
	   Germany banned the party in 1993 after attacks on Turkish
consulates and businesses in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.

	   Demonstrators chanted ``We want justice,'' as the ambulance went
past. Chilean diplomatic vehicles followed with armed police at the
rear.
	   There was no immediate word on where Pinochet was headed.
Supporters have been looking for a house where he can wait in
comfort to learn whether the British government will agree to
extradition.
	   There was speculation he would head to a nine-bedroom home on a
luxurious estate, in Surrey, near the Wentworth Golf Club, home of
the European golf tour, about 20 miles (30 kms) west of central
London.
	   If Home Secretary Jack Straw, who must rule by Dec. 11, allows
extradition proceedings to begin, Pinochet will likely be in
Britain for months fighting his case through the courts.
	   Wherever he stays, his neighbors face disruption. Chilean exiles
mount demonstrations, and there is a police guard and heavy police
presence.
	   Earlier, his lawyer said Pinochet was distressed by the
hospital's demand for him to leave. He had planned to move on
Monday, but the arrangement fell through because of ``unforeseen
practical difficulties,'' said lawyer Michael Caplan.
	   Adding to Pinochet's troubles, an opinion poll published Tuesday
indicated that a narrow majority _ 51 percent _ of Britons think
Pinochet should be extradited.
	   The National Opinion poll published in London's Evening Standard
said 32 percent of a 961-strong sample of voters questioned
nationwide wanted him sent home and the rest had no opinion. The
error margin was plus or minus three percent.
	   A Chilean government report says some 3,000 people were murdered
or disappeared at the hands of the secret police during Pinochet's
1970-93 rule.
	   But Chile is trying to get him back because of fears that the
anger of his supporters may destabilize its democracy.
	   Chile's foreign minister Jose Miguel Insulza was in Spain
Tuesday, after lobbying British officials, arguing that Pinochet
may be tried in Chile if he is freed.

Pompidou Center sued for buying Nazi-looted Jewish art
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARILYN AUGUST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The heirs of a Jewish art collector whose claims
for a Nazi-looted Braque painting were rejected have sued the
Georges Pompidou Center for receiving stolen property, their lawyer
said Tuesday.
	   The suit is the first of its kind in France, where the National
Museum Authority possesses nearly 2,000 pieces of art looted by the
Nazis during World War II.
	   Antoine Comte, the lawyer representing the heirs of Alphonse
Kann, claims the Pompidou Center acquired ``Le Joueur de Guitare''
(The Guitar Player) in 1981 knowing of its murky wartime past.
	   But Pompidou Center President Jean-Jacques Aillagon told The
Associated Press that the center had bought the painting ``in good
faith.''
	   ``The committee had no idea that the painting transited through
the Kann collection,'' he said in a telephone interview.
	   The legal action comes during a major conference on looted
Jewish assets in Washington, and in the wake of a spate of comments
by French officials eager to show that progress is being made.
	   President Jacques Chirac said Monday that the ``question of
reparation has become a top priority.''
	   Speaking at the inauguration of the new Museum of Jewish Art and
History, Chirac addressed the thorny issue of unclaimed art works,
a group of which are displayed in the museum.
	   ``Among the works on exhibit in this museum are some that were
stolen from families that never returned from their long path of
suffering. The place of these works, naturally, is here (France),''
he said _ referring to France's determination to keep the works at
home rather than have them sold at auction to benefit survivors, as
some have advocated.
	   The French Jewish community supports that position, but has
urged quicker action.
	   At a Jewish group's dinner on Saturday, Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin announced measures to speed up the handling of individual
restitution claims. France has returned five works in the last two
years.
	   During the war, Nazi soldiers looted thousands of works from
French Jews. Those paintings considered ``degenerate'' were sold
off or traded. The Braque, a geometrical collage done in 1914 and
today one of the Pompidou Center's most prestigious possessions,
was one of them.
	   The painting finally surfaced in a 1948 exhibition in Germany.
It traveled to New York and Cleveland in 1949.
	   Its provenance: a loan from Andre Lefevre, a Parisian collector
notorious for trading with the Nazis.
	   Earlier this year, the Pompidou Center rejected the Kann
family's restitution claim, saying it bought the dlrs 2 million
work ``honestly.'' The suit, filed Monday in a Paris criminal
court, means that a magistrate will open an inquiry.
	   Hundreds of looted works were returned to the Kann family after
the war. Last year, Kann's heirs recovered Albert Gleizes'
``Paysage Cubist'' from the government.

the European golf tour, about 20 miles (30 kms) west of central
London.
	   If Home Secretary Jack Straw, who must rule by Dec. 11, allows
extradition proceedings to begin, Pinochet will likely be in
Britain for months fighting his case through the courts.
	   Wherever he stays, his neighbors face disruption. Chilean exiles
mount demonstrations, and there is a police guard and heavy police
presence.
	   Earlier, his lawyer said Pinochet was distressed by the
hospital's demand for him to leave. He had planned to move on
Monday, but the arrangement fell through because of ``unforeseen
practical difficulties,'' said lawyer Michael Caplan.
	   Adding to Pinochet's troubles, an opinion poll published Tuesday
indicated that a narrow majority _ 51 percent _ of Britons think
Pinochet should be extradited.
	   The National Opinion poll published in London's Evening Standard
said 32 percent of a 961-strong sample of voters questioned
nationwide wanted him sent home and the rest had no opinion. The
error margin was plus or minus three percent.
	   A Chilean government report says some 3,000 people were murdered
or disappeared at the hands of the secret police during Pinochet's
1970-93 rule.
	   But Chile is trying to get him back because of fears that the
anger of his supporters may destabilize its democracy.
	   Chile's foreign minister Jose Miguel Insulza was in Spain
Tuesday, after lobbying British officials, arguing that Pinochet
may be tried in Chile if he is freed.

Italy to use semifinal trio against Sweden
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Italy will use the same trio of players who
upset the United States when it takes on defending champion Sweden
in this weekend's Davis Cup final at Assago Forum.
	   Italian captain Paolo Bertolucci announced Tuesday that Andrea
Gaudenzi and Davide Sanguinetti will play the singles with Diego
Nargiso teaming with Gaudenzi in the doubles.
	   Gianluca Pozzi will be along as a reserve.
	   ``You can't change a winning team,'' Bartolucci said.
	   Italy's top-ranked player, Gaudenzi and Sanguinetti and Nargiso
routed a Sampras- and Agassi-less United States 4-1 in the
semifinals at Milwaukee.
	   Meanwhile Thomas Johansson, who has been nursing a strained
right knee, may become a last-minute starter for Sweden in the
three-day, best-of-5 indoor final on clay on the outskirts of
Milan.
	   Johansson, initially dropped from the Swedish team because of
the knee and his questionable results on clay, trained at the Forum
this week showing good form.
	   Johansson may replace Magnus Norman on Sweden's quartet.
	   Swedish captain Carl-Axel Hageskog said he will announce his
team on Thursday _ the day of the official draw in Milan _ and
declined to comment on Johansson's chances.
	   Johansson is the highest-ranked Swedish player in the ATP Tour
computer at 17th.
	   Sweden enters the final as favorite to clinch its seventh title
and third in four years.
	   However Hageskog noted Italy may have the advantage playing on
clay.
	   ``Otherwise, I'm not worried with the home crowd. My players are
able to negotiate every situation,'' he said.

Rwanda releases first genocide suspects held without evidence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Citing a lack of evidence, the government
of Rwanda on Tuesday released 76 prisoners held in connection with
the 1994 massacre of an estimated half-million Tutsis.
	   The government said the files of those released Tuesday from
Kigali's Rilima prison had either been lost or did not support a
charge of taking part in or supporting genocide.
	   Rwanda's crowded jails hold 130,000 people awaiting genocide
trials, most of them Hutus imprisoned on charges relating to the
government-organized slaughter of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis
in 1994.
	   To speed up trials and meet international justice standards, the
government announced it would release 31,000 prisoners for lack of
evidence. Many of those scheduled to be freed were detained on a
simple accusation and have never been charged or questioned.
	   So far, more than 350 people have been tried in connection with
the genocide, and at least 120 have been sentenced to death. Firing
squads executed 22 people on April 24.
	   The nation's overburdened justice system is recovering from four
years of civil war that killed or forced into exile many of the
judges, lawyers and court officials.
	   Critics say the authorities are setting free those who
perpetrated the massacre, but whose police files were lost due to
negligence or malice.
	   Justice officials said they expected a number of those released
to be rearrested if additional, substantial evidence is brought
against them.
	   In Arusha, Tanzania, the United Nations has been conducting
separate trials of Rwandan genocide suspects.
	   The tribunal has 32 suspects in custody. Two have been sentenced
to life in prison, the maximum sentence the tribunal can impose.

Formula One champion to get own postage stamp
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Finland will issue a postage stamp
honoring Formula One champion Mika Hakkinen, the post office
announced Tuesday.
	   Two million of the 3-markkaa (58-cent) stamp will be issued on
Jan. 15, said Markku Penttinen from the post office's philatelic
center.
	   Foreign philatelists and racing fans had inquired if the post
office would issue a Hakkinen stamp if he won the championship,
Penttinen said.
	   ``We believed in his victory,'' Penttinen said. ``And we began
planning the stamp before the crucial race,'' in Japan on Nov. 1,
he said.
	   The stamp shows a smiling Hakkinen in silver overalls, holding
his arms up in a demonstration of victory.
	   Previously, the Finnish Post Office has issued stamps of leading
sports figures, including world rally champions Timo Makinen and
Juha Kankkunen.

Top clubs agree on new UEFA Cup format
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ UEFA and several of Europe's top clubs agreed
Tuesday on a format for a new-look UEFA Cup competition.
	   The revamped competition, merging the existing UEFA Cup and Cup
Winners Cup, should start with 96 teams, UEFA's European Football
2000 Task Force decided. The same number of clubs participate in
the opening rounds of the current two cups.
	   If UEFA's executive committee approves the proposal, eight teams
which fail to qualify from their Champions League groups will join
the UEFA Cup in its third round.
	   ``It means we have more quality,'' UEFA General Secretary
Gerhard Aigner told reporters.
	   The cup will have one qualifying round. An alternative proposal
with a smaller starting lineup would have required three summer
qualifying rounds.
	   Under the Task Force proposal, countries whose teams reach the
UEFA Cup quarterfinals will receive an extra place in the following
season's competition.
	   The group also discussed the financial structure of the revamped
Champions League.
	   In October, representatives of AC Milan, Real Madrid and 10
other major teams agreed not to join a breakaway Super League after
UEFA promised to extend next season's European Champions' League
from 24 teams to 32, playing in eight groups of four in the first
stage.
	   Clubs agreed Tuesday that 5 percent of the money they receive
from the new competition should go to the leagues of participating
teams, Aigner said.
	   The money would be distributed to clubs which don't qualify for
European competitions and ``must be used for education of young
players,'' he added.
	   The European governing body expects the new-look Champions
League to generate some 800 million francs (dlrs 570 million).
Around three-quarters would be distributed to clubs under both the
current system of match and performance fees and the clubs' market
value.
	   UEFA's executive committee is expected to give final approval to
the revamped competitions and decide on a starting date for them
when it meets next week in Lausanne, Switzerland.
	   ``We have set the sails for a start next season,'' Aigner said.
Top clubs want the new competitions to begin then to maximize their
potential earnings.

Sharp drops on European exchanges after Wall Street, Asian dips
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Share prices dropped sharply on European stock
exchanges Tuesday in a swirl of gloom and profit-taking, following
big falls on Wall Street and in Asian markets.
	   The London Stock Exchange, Europe's largest, set the pace with a
fall of 3.6 percent on the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index.
	   ``We have seen quite a rally in the last week or so, but
investors are nervous,'' said Tessa Kohn-Speyer, investment analyst
at Barclays Stockbrokers in London. ``There has been a lot of
speculation that the market will fall back again so they have been
trying to cash in on profits today.''
	   Key indexes were down 5.0 percent in Germany, 4.0 percent in
Paris, 5.2 percent in Moscow, 4.7 percent in Amsterdam and 2.7
percent Stockholm.
	   ``There was just nothing supportive out there,'' said Peter
Caulkett of Teather-and-Greenwood in London. ``But there is a
feeling that stocks had come up too far too soon and investors are
now running scared.''
	   Dmitry Kulyashenits, trader at Moscow investment bank MFK
Renaissance, said: ``There was profit-taking everywhere. Russia
wasn't an exception.''
	   The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 2.3 percent Monday in
the first big wave of profit-taking since the market recovered
strongly two months ago. The Dow was off again Tuesday morning but
came back just into positive territory by early afternoon.
	   Asian markets had followed New York's lead, with Hong Kong's
Hang Seng Index down 4.1 percent Tuesday, and Singapore's Straits
Times Index off 3.4 percent. Tokyo was an exception, with a mild
0.3 percent decline in the Nikkei 225-stock average.
	   Local concerns contributed to the drops on some European
exchanges.
	   Analysts in Frankfurt said the declines in German stock prices
partly reflected disappointment with Deutsche Bank's announcement
that it expected no immediate savings from its takeover of Bankers
Trust Corp.
	   In Paris, the CAC-40 index was down 4.0 percent, led by 12
percent plunge in shares of Total. Investors deserted the petroleum
company after it announced it was getting back into the refinery
sector by acquiring Petrofina of Belgium. Petrofina shares rose 18
percent on the Brussels exchange.

Italian power signs Romanian to replace Simoni
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS season in 15th graf to 1999-2000. &QL; 
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Internazionale on Tuesday signed Romanian
Mircea Lucescu to replace Gigi Simoni as coach of the star-studded
but volatile Milan team through the end of the Italian Serie A
season in May.
	   Lucescu's hiring, for a reported 1 billion lire (dlrs 555,000),
was announced at Inter's training camp one day after the startling
dismissal of Simoni.
	   The Italian veteran was fired despite consecutive victories
which kept Inter in contention for the European Champions Cup and
Italian league titles.
	   Club president Massimo Moratti bitterly criticized Inter's play
following a 3-1 victory against defending champion Real Madrid in a
European Champions League game last Wednesday and an injury-time
2-1 victory against lightly regarded Salernitana in a league match
Sunday.
	   Inter, whose roster includes Ronaldo, Youri Djorkaeff, Roberto
Baggio, Diego Simeone and Ivan Zamorano, is in sixth place in the
Italian league with a 5-2-4 record and 17 points, five behind
league-leading Fiorentina.
	   Lucescu, a former Romanian national team coach and manager of
several club sides including Dynamo Bucharest and Italy's Brescia
and Reggiana, was presented to the Italian media at Appiano Gentile
Tuesday afternoon.
	   He then directed the first training session with Inter players
for Sunday's league match against Vicenza.
	   ``I will need time to change the team ... to switch to zone
defense and make the play more offensive,'' Lucescu said.
	   ``I'm convinced I did the right thing,'' Moratti said Tuesday.
``I think to have interpreted the feeling of our fans, who were
unhappy with the team play.''
	   Inter sold a record of 60,000 season tickets this year after it
won the UEFA Cup title and finished second to Juventus in the
Italian league last season.
	   Simoni, whose stay with Inter was stormy since the beginning of
his two-year contract, said Tuesday he was the victim of ``an
unfair, unexpected decision.''
	   Some Italian sports dailies suggested that Simoni paid for the
bad start of Brazilian superstar Ronaldo, who has been repeatedly
sidelined with tendinitis in his knee and failed to provide the
Milan team with the goals and play he produced last season.
	   Simoni also had been criticized frequently for his overly
defensive tactics.
	   Lucescu, 53, is expected by many to be an interim manager until
Italian Marcello Lippi can take over.
	   Lippi is rumored to ben leaving league champion Juventus of
Turin at the end of this season and could join Inter for the
1999-2000 season. However, Moratti denied a decision for next
season has been make.
	   ``Lucescu can prove he deserves to coach a great team. He could
be a more lasting solution,'' Moratti said.

Kremlin says Yeltsin improving, still in hospital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new grafs 8-10 with interview with spokesman. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin is feeling better, but is
still spending part of the day in a hospital bed as he continues to
be treated for pneumonia, officials said Tuesday.
	   A Kremlin spokesman said the president was doing limited
paperwork and there were no plans for any meetings or visitors. He
did not say how much longer Yeltsin would remain in the government
hospital where he has been for 10 days.
	   Yeltsin's first deputy chief of staff Oleg Sysuyev said Tuesday
that the president is expected to return to work at the Kremlin
``in the nearest time.''
	   ``Doctors are having trouble keeping the president in the
hospital,'' Sysuyev said at a news conference.
	   The 67-year-old leader is known as a restless patient who
sometimes ignores the advice of his doctors.
	   Dr. Renat Akchurin, who conducted Yeltsin's heart bypass surgery
two years ago, said the president's repeated illnesses may be due
to a weakened immune system.
	   Akchurin said that he has not examined Yeltsin for eight months
but said heart problems appeared unlikely, according to an
interview with the weekly Argumenty i Fakty cited by the Interfax
news agency. He also dismissed speculation that Yeltsin's heart
surgery had affected his brain.
	   Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin insisted that the president
had no problems remembering anything and was always alert.
	   Yeltsin ``is unhappy about being sick, he is not submitting to
his illness,'' Yakushkin said in an interview with the weekly
Sobesednik also cited by Interfax.
	   ``It's interesting though not always easy to talk to the
president,'' Yakushkin said, calling Yeltsin ``quite an emotional
person.''
	   Yeltsin met his chief-of-staff Valentin Yumashev in the hospital
Monday and was briefed on government and national affairs.
	   On Tuesday, the president spoke by telephone with Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov to discuss the agenda of the premier's talks with
International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus, who arrived in
Moscow later on Tuesday.
	   Russian television showed brief footage of Yeltsin, dressed in a
white shirt and dark cardigan and looking pale, listening intently
to his aide and nodding periodically. Like most footage of Yeltsin
released in recent weeks, Monday's tape didn't contain any sound of
the president speaking.
	   Yeltsin's repeated illnesses and his infrequent public
appearances have raised concerns about his ability to lead the
country _ now mired in its worst economic crisis since the 1991
Soviet collapse _ through the end of his term in mid-2000.
	   Sysuyev reiterated Tuesday that Yeltsin will concentrate on
political matters, leaving day-to-day management of economic
matters to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov. ``You shouldn't think
that the president and his office aren't taking part and
controlling the economic developments, such as preparing next
year's budget and tax reform,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin has remained out of public view throughout the latest
economic crisis that hit in mid-August, further eroding his sagging
popularity.
	   ``It's known that the president now doesn't have sufficiently
high popularity, to put it mildly,'' Sysuyev said, according to the
Interfax news agency. He insisted, however, that the president
continues to play a stabilizing role in Russian society, blunting
antagonism between different political forces.

Cocoa prices dip again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Selling pressure on world markets in recent days
has pushed down the average wholesale cost of cocoa to its lowest
level for nearly a year and a half.
	   The International Cocoa Organization's latest daily cocoa market
indicator price fell to dlrs 1,550.23 (939.53 pounds) per metric
ton Tuesday _ a level last seen in June 1997.
	   Worries about consumption prospects because of Russia's and
Asia's economic problems, and the improving crop outlook in the key
West African producing region, have recently put cocoa prices under
pressure, according to traders.
	   Production prospects have also brightened in Brazil and
Indonesia, thanks to better weather this year, traders said.
	   Analysts say that early forecasts that global consumption of
cocoa _ more than 95 percent of which is in chocolate and
associated confectionery and beverage products _ would outstrip
production this season now no longer look so certain.
	   At the same time, industry figures show that global stock of
cocoa _ a big export earner for Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Cameroon
and Nigeria _ remain high historically, after the big boost given
by the record world crop three seasons ago.

Juventus official defends travel plans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Juventus general director Luciano Moggi on
Tuesday defended as ``well grounded'' the club decision to travel
to Istanbul on game day for the politically tinged European
Champions League match against Galatasaray.
	   The Italian league champions, who need a victory to keep its
quarterfinal chances alive, have decided to travel to Istanbul on
Wednesday and return home immediately after the game.
	   UEFA, Europe's governing body for soccer, requires teams to
arrive the day before of European Cup matches and was critical of
Juventus' decision.
	   ``Juventus feels there are well grounded motives for failing to
conform to UEFA directives,'' Moggi sauid.
	   Juventus confirmed on Tuesday its travel plans for the match,
which was postponed by a week after anti-Italian demonstrations
erupted in Turkey over Italy's refusal to extradite a Kurdish rebel
leader.
	   Several Juventus players, who had initially refused to travel to
Instanbul, bowed to the club decision to play Galatasaray but
criticized the UEFA stand.
	   ``We have been forced to play a game conditioned by political
motives,'' Juventus starting goalkeeper Angelo Peruzzi said.
	   Team captain Antonio Conte said Tuesday that the Italian
government and UEFA left the Italian team standing alone.
	   ``UEFA and the (Italian) government have claimed that there are
no security problems in Istanbul ... but as far as we know no UEFA
and government representatives will be in Istanbul Wednesday,''
Conte told the Italian news agency ANSA.
	   Italian culture minister Giovanna Melandri, who was invited to
attend the game by her Turkish counterpart, said Tuesday she had
not yet decided whether to travel to Istanbul.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Authorities assigned more than 20,000
policemen to a politically charged Champions League match Wednesday
pitting Juventus of Italy against Turkey's Galatasaray.
	   ``We will do our best to start and finish the game without any
incidents,'' Interior Minister Kutlu Aktas told reporters Tuesday.
``Everyone should know that this is a sports competition.''
	   The tight security measures are intended to protect Juventus
players from any possible acts by Turks angry at Italy for refusing
to extradite a Kurdish rebel leader.
	   Italy has declined to return Ocalan, who was arrested in Rome on
Nov. 12, because he faces the death penalty in Turkey for capital
crimes. Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, has been fighting
for autonomy in southeastern Turkey for 14 years and the Turkish
government holds him responsible for thousands of deaths.
	   Aktas said that police will use a heavy hand against
troublemakers, warning that ``whoever gets involved in provocative
acts will be severely punished.''
	   Private NTV television said some 22,000 policemen were assigned
to the match. Aktas said military units would also be called in.
	   The game will be played after a one-week postponement by
European soccer's governing body UEFA for security concerns.
Tension has declined since then.
	   Mass circulation dailies also called on the fans to stay calm.
	   ``Welcome Juve,'' headlined the daily Hurriyet in Italian,
saying Turks would put to shame those who have said Turkey was
unsafe by showing ``maturity and hospitality.''
	   NTV said police would search spectators entering the Ali Sami
Yen stadium for knives and clubs. Banners and fireworks are also
banned.
	   Roads to be used by Juventus players will be cordoned off, daily
Milliyet said.
	   But it was not clear if the measures would ease Juventus'
concerns.
	   Juventus general director Luiciano Moggi said Monday that they
``will not be going calmly,'' to Istanbul.
	   In a concession to the players' misgivings, the club announced
it would fly to Istanbul hours before the game and depart
immediately after the match. Juventus had planned to head to
Istanbul on Tuesday.
	   Several Juventus players, including French World Cup hero
Zinedine Zidane, had threatened to refuse to play in Istanbul.
	   ``We were kind of forced to go to play. We're very worried,''
Juventus 'keeper Angelo Peruzzi said Monday. ``UEFA and the Italian
and Turkish governments know that they have taken on a big
responsibility.''
	   Prior to the UEFA postponement, demonstrators set fire to a Fiat
car, a motorbike and numerous Italian flags.
	   Galatasaray has accused UEFA of favoring the Italian team by
postponing the game and allegedly giving injured Juventus players
time to recover.
	   Galatasaray coach Fatih Terim vowed to defeat Juve.
	   ``Hopefully, we will write history,'' sports daily Foto Mac
quoted Terim as saying Tuesday. ``Italians will return empty
handed.''
	   Romanian striker Gheorghe Hagi of Galatasaray was more cautious.
	   ``Ignoring Juventus' power would be suicide,'' Hagi said.
	   Galatasaray has seven points in Group B, one behind Norway's
Rosenborg. Juventus has four, but both teams have played one fewer
game than the Norwegians.

Swimmer Gary Hall cleared to compete

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more FINA comment; EDITS &QL; 
 &UR; By AMANDA RIDDLE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHOENIX (AP) _ Olympic champion Gary Hall was cleared Tuesday to
swim in a World Cup meet despite a marijuana-related suspension
scheduled to run through Dec. 12.
	   U.S. federal court Judge Roger Strand, who issued a temporary
restraining order Monday allowing Hall to compete, upheld by his
earlier ruling.
	   FINA, swimming's world governing body, contended Hall's appeal
should be dismissed and the rest of his suspension upheld. The
organization said the court should have no jurisdiction in the
case.
	   FINA secretary Gunnar Werner said the federation would not
appeal.
	   ``We can do nothing more other than obey the order,'' he said
Tuesday by phone from Sweden.
	   ``This decision is only valid in the United States,'' he added.
``Hall is still suspended in the rest of the world.''
	   Hall's appeal against FINA's three-month suspension still has to
be heard in full by the Court of Arbitration of Sport in
Switzerland.
	   ``Our position is that FINA rules are prevailing in a case like
this,'' Werner said. ``Our position is the court in the U.S. is not
competent.''
	   Werner said an appeal would take too long. He added that the
case underscores the ongoing battle between international sports
federations and the courts, especially in the United States.
	   ``Our position is that FINA rules should prevail all around the
world,'' he said. ``But what can we do if a national court makes a
ruling? We can only fight for our position.''
	   Hall, who lives in Phoenix, won gold medals as part of the U.S.
400-meter freestyle and 400 medley relay teams in the 1996 Atlanta
Games. He also won silver medals in the 50 and 100 freestyle.
	   He was scheduled to compete in Tuesday's World Cup meet, and
later this week in the U.S. Open meet, both in College Station,
Texas.
	   His lawyers argued that both competitions are essential to
Hall's bid to compete in the 2000 Olympics and secure endorsements.
	   Hall was temporarily suspended in July after FINA said he tested
positive for marijuana during a May 15 competition in Phoenix. That
prevented Hall from swimming in the Goodwill Games and the U.S.
Senior Nationals.
	   The federation delayed the suspension in August to allow a
hearing after Hall appealed.
	   During a Nov. 6 hearing, Hall received his three-month
suspension from FINA's doping panel for testing positive for
marijuana. That suspension was effective Nov. 12.
	   FINA then deducted two of the three months already served by
Hall during the temporary suspension, which left him with 30 more
days to serve.

EU makes little progress on budget reform

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union finance ministers failed
Tuesday to narrow differences over how to pay for plans to bring up
to 12 new members into the Union over the coming decade.
	   British, French and German ministers said there was growing
support for plans to freeze EU spending up to 2006 around current
levels of 85 billion European currency units (dlrs 100 billion) a
year.
	   But less well off EU members _ Spain, Portugal, Greece and
Ireland _ are seeking an increase in spending to ensure they don't
lose out when even poorer nations in central and eastern Europe
join the club.
	   ``It is a difficult area, sufficient progress has not been
made,'' said Austrian Finance Minister Rudolf Edlinger, who chaired
the day-long meeting.
	   The finance ministers had hoped to draw up guidelines on the
budget debate to the leaders of the 15 EU nations who hold their
year-end summit next week in Vienna.
	   Although the leaders are hoping to move the issue forward in the
Austrian capital, they have set a deadline of next Spring to
overhaul the budget.
	   Complicating the question are demands by Germany, the
Netherlands, Austria and Sweden for a reduction in their membership
dues to the EU.

Report: Italy's Telecom to reach accord by Christmas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Telecom Italia SpA said Tuesday that its
board has given its new chief executive a mandate to conduct
broad-based negotiations for the development of a digital platform.
	   Later, the Italian news agency AGI reported that Telecom will
likely reach an agreement for a digital television platform by
Christmas.
	   No one at Telecom Italia was immediately available to comment.
	   Telecom Italia would only say that Franco Bernabe, who took up
his post last week, will be spearheading the company's efforts to
form an alliance for satellite digital television.
	   Last week, the chairman and chief executive of News Corp.,
Rupert Murdoch, said that News Corp. was close to signing a digital
television agreement with Telecom Italia that would create a
company to compete with Telepiu, the pay-TV unit that is 90 percent
controlled by Canal Plus SA.

Companies close checkbooks in protest against Suriname's exchange

<TEXT>
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ Delivering a stunning economic blow
to Suriname's government, two aluminum mining companies on Tuesday
stopped paying taxes and exchanging their dollars through the
national bank.
	   The Suriname Aluminum Co., a branch of Pittsburgh-based Aluminum
Company of America, and the Suriname Billiton Bauxite Co. claim the
government cheated them out of dlrs 17 million over the last 14
months by buying their U.S. currency for half what it is worth.
	   They will only convert enough money to meet their payroll of
about 3,000 people.
	   Suriname, a Dutch-speaking country in South America that is the
Western Hemisphere's second-poorest nation after Haiti, exports
bauxite and finished aluminum worth dlrs 359 million annually. The
exports are the country's largest source of hard currency.
	   Under Surinamese law, the two companies must change their
foreign exchange earnings to Surinamese guilders at the Suriname
Central Bank.
	   The service charge for the exchange is one of the largest
sources of income for the government. Suriname Aluminum Co. alone
exchanged about dlrs 2 million per month through the bank.
	   But the official exchange rate set by the bank is 396 guilders
to the U.S. dollar, while street prices hover around 700 guilders
to the dollar.
	   Natural resources minister Errol Alibux said he had called a
meeting with leaders of the two companies to discuss the protest.
	   Suriname has been wracked by unrest linked to rising inflation
despite efforts to control the exchange rate. A new sales tax,
imposed just before Christmas last year, outraged workers.
Government employees are currently in their fourth week of a strike
to demand raises.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Activists across the globe
marched in the streets, distributed condoms and held benefit
concerts Tuesday to try to halt the spread of AIDS, which will kill
millions of people this year alone.
	   Underscoring events on World AIDS Day was this sobering fact:
Although powerful new medicines are helping industrialized
countries win the battle against the disease, it has reached
epidemic proportions in continents where people can't afford the
drugs.
	   About 33.4 million people around the world are infected with
HIV, two-thirds of them in sub-Saharan Africa. In Asia and the
Pacific, 700,000 people become infected with HIV per year.
	   In sub-Saharan Africa, the 1998 death toll from AIDS is expected
to be 2 million. Nearly 6 million more people will become infected
this year _ 1.7 million of them in sub-Saharan Africa.
	   ``In the case of HIV/AIDS, the difference in wealth becomes
literally matter of life and death,'' decried Mary Robinson, the
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.
	   From bars in Hong Kong to parks in South Africa, activists
preached safe sex. People pinned red ribbons on lapels to express
solidarity in the fight against AIDS. In San Juan, Puerto Rico,
more than 3,000 people formed a human red ribbon.
	   ``It's important to be here, to urge people to say `No' to AIDS
and to protect themselves,'' said Carlos Baerga, a free agent
baseball player most recently with the New York Mets. Those whose
loved ones died from AIDS planned to toss carnations into the
Atlantic Ocean in their memory.
	   _ In India, where up to 5 million people are HIV positive,
hundreds of schoolchildren marched beside prostitutes in New Delhi
to draw attention to the epidemic.
	   _ Israelis and Palestinians handed out condoms and literature to
passengers departing Israel's international airport in Tel Aviv.
	   _ In Ivory Coast, thousands of children wearing T-shirts with
anti-AIDS slogans and bouncing inflated condoms like beach balls
marched through the streets of Abidjan.
	   _ In Kenya, children wearing black T-Shirts that said ``Stop
AIDS'' distributed condoms and pamphlets on AIDS prevention in
Dandora, an eastern Nairobi slum.
	   _ In Hong Kong's nightspots, activists handed out coasters with
pictures of a condom on one side and a safe-sex message on the
other.
	   _ In Tokyo, Japan's Health Ministry held rallies and concerts in
a central square.
	   _ In Moscow, a contraceptive company's employees sheathed in
red, yellow or green ``condom suits'' handed out condoms in Pushkin
Square.
	   _ In Pretoria, South Africa, clowns painted red AIDS ribbons on
people's faces as drum majorettes entertained a crowd.
	   Underneath it all was a life-and-death message: Practice safe
sex or face the consequences.
	   ``Come and witness the reality of AIDS. See the devastation in
our community. See the fresh graves,'' South African President
Nelson Mandela told hundreds of people in a village in
KwaZulu-Natal province, where an estimated 25 percent of adults are
infected with HIV.
	   But considering the enormity of the problem, the call to action
worldwide was muted.
	   In some countries like Zimbabwe, where an estimated 23 percent
of the population is infected with HIV, World AIDS day passed with
little fanfare. Countries in southern Africa have been slow to
recognize the unfolding tragedy and have little resources to fight
it.
	   It was only in October that the South African government
launched an AIDS awareness program. Already, more than 3 million
South Africans are infected. This year an estimated 168,000 have
died from AIDS.
	   The vast majority of those infected in Africa and other
developing regions cannot afford the drugs that are prolonging life
among AIDS patients in the West.
	   In Washington, President Bill Clinton announced dlrs 10 million
in emergency grants to help children orphaned by AIDS in poorer
nations. Much more assistance would be needed to help turn the
tide.
	   Robinson, the top human rights official at the U.N., said: ``The
current situation is an indictment of the international allocation
of resources to fight HIV/AIDS in developing nations.''

	   ROME (AP) _ Italian first-division club AS Roma is close to
purchasing French second-division team Nice in an effort to improve
its youth development program.
	   A spokesman for the Roman club, which is owned by Italian
industrialist Francesco Sensi, said Tuesday that negotiations with
Nice had entered the final stage.
	   ``But the formal, final agreement has not yet been reached,''
the spokesman said.
	   Club officials said the control of the French team was intended
to enable Roma to develop some of its prospective talent and scout
for others young players in France and in other countries.
	   ``Nice would be a sort of breeding-ground for young players and
for those players Roma can't immediately field,'' the spokesman
explained.
	   Roma is in second place behind Fiorentina in the Italian league
standings, while Nice is the last in the 20-team French second
division.

Rights groups applaud Guatemala sentences, say soldiers too must be

punished &QL;

	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Human rights activists applauded the death
sentences handed down to a Guatemalan civil patrol that carried out
a 1982 massacre, but said Tuesday that the military commanders who
they said oversaw it must be punished as well.
	   A court in the central province of Baja Verapaz on Monday
sentenced to death three former members of an army-trained civilian
patrol for their role in the massacre of 130 civilians on March 13,
1982 in what has come to be known as the Massacre of Rio Negro.
	   Their convictions were the first for crimes committed in
Guatemala's 36-year civil war, which ended in 1996.
	   ``The investigation must remain open so that the masterminds of
the massacre, including high-ranking military officers, can be
brought to justice,'' said Walter Valencia of the Human Rights
Legal Action Center.
	   The men were convicted based on testimony from the survivors,
many of whom had campaigned for years to bring the killers to
justice.
	   The Rio Negro massacre was part of Guatemala's so-called
scorched earth campaign to root out civilian support for the
Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity supporters. Hundreds of
Maya Indian villages were razed during the early 1980s.
	   An estimated 150,000 people died in Guatemala's civil war and
thousands more were tortured or kidnapped. A report released
earlier this year by a Roman Catholic Church human rights office
blamed the army for nearly 80 percent of the killings.
	   Herlindo Hichos, a member of the Missing Persons' Relatives
Association, said legal proceedings ``must be brought against those
who ordered these criminal acts.''
	   Judge Otto Mayan Morales, who handed the sentences, said
authorities were searching for another nine patrol members who
participated in the massacre. But he said no soldiers were with the
patrol during the massacre.
	   The sentences in the city of Salama, 25 miles (40 kilometers)
north of Guatemala City, came as another war-crimes case against
soldiers reopened after a seven-month delay because the public
prosecutor received death threats and resigned.
	   The trial of 27 Guatemalan soldiers accused in the 1995 Xaman
massacre reopened Nov. 25 with a new prosecutor, Alejandro Nunez
Pivarel.
	   Nunez said he would call 25 witnesses, including survivors of
the attack in the village of Xaman. Eleven people _ among them an
8-year-old boy _ died when a military patrol opened fire on
resettled refugees; 27 others were wounded.
	   The Xaman trial is the first in Guatemala to take members of the
armed forces to court for any of the 424 massacres attributed to
them during the civil war.

Iraq says team tried to buy `permitted' missile parts in Romania
</HEADLINE>

adviser; CHANGES byline, overline &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Monday denied it tried to buy
prohibited missile technology in Romania, but admitted sending a
team to that country to settle ``outstanding matters'' relating to
an old contract.
	   The team also was interested in ``some forging and
precision-casting technologies'' for short-range missiles that Iraq
is allowed to produce by the U.N. Security Council, Lt. Gen. Amer
al-Saadi, a top adviser to President Saddam Hussein, told
reporters.
	   He was commenting on a report Monday by the Cable News Network
that Iraqi missile experts, escorted by Iraqi secret police, went
to Bucharest to negotiate the purchase of guidance equipment for
banned long-range missiles.
	   The report is ``regrettably tendentious, baseless and full of
distortions as part of the hostile media campaign against Iraq,''
al-Saadi said.
	   Iraq has over the years claimed that is has ended all programs
to build mass destruction weapons as required by Security Council
resolutions adopted after the 1991 Gulf War, which ended Iraq's
occupation of Kuwait.
	   However, the Iraqi claims are disputed by the U.N. Special
Commission, which is responsible for dismantling its chemical and
biological weapons and missiles with a range more than 150
kilometers (93 miles).
	   Until UNSCOM gives Iraq a clean bill of health, the Security
Council will not lift U.N. economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Al-Saadi said an Iraqi team did travel to Romania in May this
year ``but not for the purpose of obtaining prohibited material or
technology.''
	   ``The purpose was to settle outstanding matters regarding a
contract made in 1995 for materials, which was known to (UNSCOM)
and were subjected to ongoing monitoring by them,'' he said.
	   Al-Saadi is widely believed to be the mastermind of Iraq's
chemical and biological weapons program.
	   According to CNN, the Iraqi purchase in Bucharest was blocked
because spy agencies from the United States and two other
countries, which were not identified, uncovered the potential deal
and monitored the Iraqis' two-week visit.
	   CNN on Tuesday stood by its report, which had quoted unnamed
sources and Scott Ritter, an American ex-Marine who resigned as an
UNSCOM member in August after complaining that the U.S. government
was not being tough enough with Iraq.
	   Al-Saadi said UNSCOM was fully aware at the time that Iraq had a
legal project to develop short-range missiles and that UNSCOM has
constantly monitored and witnessed static and flight tests.
	   ``Scott Ritter ... is now trying to portray himself as a Rambo
style hero for personal reasons and to serve Israeli objectives,''
al-Saadi said.
	   Also Tuesday, the spokeswoman for the U.N. weapons inspectors
said the United Nations has brought its complement of 120 weapons
inspectors in Iraq up to full strength.
	   The inspectors returned to Baghdad last month after a brief
pull-out following Iraq's refusal to allow them to work. Iraq
relented on Nov. 14, only hours before U.S. military strikes were
to be launched.

Tensions rise over Palestinian prisoners, Jewish settlements
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS Top to LEAD with Palestinian official's comments and
Israeli reaction &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinians stepped up their demands Tuesday
for the release of prisoners jailed for anti-Israel acts, but Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would not budge on the issue.
	   At a rally for prisoner releases in the West Bank city of
Ramallah, Ahmed Qureai, speaker of the Palestinian legislature,
alluded to the six-year Palestinian uprising against Israeli
occupation when he told the crowd, ``the leadership that threw
stones is prepared once again to throw stones in order to free the
people and to free the land.''
	   The comments drew a sharp response from Israel. ``The prime
minister will not tolerate threats of violence,'' read a statement
issued by Netanyahu's office.
	   Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
appealed to U.S. President Bill Clinton to resolve growing tensions
over Israel's refusal so-called security prisoners.
	   Netanyahu said he could not release prisoners who had been
involved in attacks on Israelis. ``I will not back down on this,''
he vowed.
	   The issue, which has prompted clashes between stone-throwing
Palestinian youths and Israeli soldiers, is raising concern about
an outbreak of violence in advance of Clinton's Dec. 12-15 visit to
Israel and the Palestinian-ruled lands.
	   The Israeli daily Haaretz reported that Israeli security
officials had urged Netanyahu to agree to free more Palestinian
activists in order to prevent rioting.
	   Palestinians claim that Israel promised at the Wye River summit
last month to free 750 prisoners from political factions such as
Arafat's Fatah group. Israel released 250 prisoners last month, but
most were car thieves and petty crooks.
	   ``This deception is creating demonstrations, anger and
frustration in the Palestinian community,'' Tibi told a Foreign
Press Association news conference.
	   Demonstrations have been held almost daily in support of
Palestinian prisoners, with some of the anger turned on Arafat and
his government.
	   Several hundred demonstrators gathered at rallies in Ramallah
and in the Gaza Strip, where about 150 children called for the
release of their fathers.
	   ``How can we live without our fathers?'' said Fidda Washah, 16,
who addressed the rally. Her father, Jabar, a member of the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine faction, has served 14 years
of a life sentence for attacking Israeli soldiers.
	   Netanyahu said he would not release anyone ``with blood on their
hands'' or members of the Islamic militant group Hamas.
	   ``The Palestinians are claiming, falsely, that I suggested
somehow to free murders at Wye,'' Netanyahu told reporters.
	   Israeli officials say only about 110 of the 2,500 Palestinian
activists behind bars could be let go in the next release,
scheduled to take place just after Clinton's visit.
	   Tibi, who was spokesman for the Palestinian delegation at Wye
Mills, Md., said only about 300 of the Palestinians currently in
jail had been involved in attacks that killed Israelis. The rest he
described as ``political prisoners.''
	   He said about 1,250 prisoners who were members of various PLO
factions and the remainder belonged to Hamas.
	   ``We would very much like him (Clinton) to interfere in the
issue of Palestinian prisoners,'' said Tibi.
	   David Bar-Illan, a senior adviser to Netanyahu, said Israel
would not agree to loosen the definition and free Palestinians
involved in attacks that only injured Israelis.
	   ``We will not budge on this one,'' Bar-Illan said, adding Israel
had freed more than 7,000 prisoners over the past five years.
	   Palestinian officials called on residents of the West Bank to
confront Israeli bulldozers that are expanding settlements or
building roads to link Israeli-controlled areas of the West Bank
and Israel.
	   ``Settlement activity should be resisted,'' said Tibi.
``Settlers are public enemy No. 1 to Palestinians.''
	   Several members of the Palestinian legislative council are
considering a boycott of Clinton's speech in Gaza City on Dec. 14
to show their anger over a failure by the United States to pressure
Israel on the settlement and prisoner issues.
	   In traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, meanwhile, Israeli
contractors bidding on the Har Homa Jewish housing project in
visited the construction site where left-wing Israelis staged a
protest. Police detained three demonstrators from the Peace Now
group trying to disrupt the tour.
	   The Palestinians hope to establish a future capital in east
Jerusalem. They say Har Homa is part of an Israeli plan to cut off
the Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem from their hinterland in
Bethlehem and the southern West Bank.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Polling stations will be heavily guarded during
local elections in St. Petersburg on Sunday _ a vote that is
believed to have played a part in the recent slaying of a prominent
liberal lawmaker.
	   Officials are also reporting multiple campaign violations as the
election nears, and two of the candidates have been formally
accused of corruption.
	   Russian media and politicians have suggested that lawmaker
Galina Starovoitova was killed to prevent her faction, Northern
Capital, from making a strong showing in the election to the
legislature in Russia's second-largest city.
	   Starovoitova was gunned down by unidentified assailants in her
apartment building in St. Petersburg last week. Police have
announced no major breakthroughs in the case.
	   Starovoitova was not on the ballot but was campaigning for her
allies, who have often spoken out against corruption.
	   The head of the Russian parliament's security committee, Viktor
Ilyukhin, on Tuesday joined those linking the killing to Sunday's
election.
	   ``Three or four crime rings in St. Petersburg largely control
business and politics,'' Ilyukhin was quoted as saying by the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   On Sunday, the 1,500 polling stations in the city will be
heavily guarded, said a senior St. Petersburg police official, Gen.
Nikolai Fyodorov.
	   Police have also started intensifying security at public places
around the city, Fyodorov said Tuesday, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   St. Petersburg is a particularly crime-ridden city, even by
Russian standards. Several prominent political and business leaders
have been killed or attacked in there in recent weeks.
	   One candidate in Sunday's election, former head of Russia's
influential Property Committee and ex-parliament member Sergei
Belyayev, has been formally charged with corruption, prosecutors
said Tuesday.
	   Another, businessman Alexander Moshkalov, was detained on
suspicion of extortion.
	   Vote rigging is also likely, the head of Russia's Central
Election Commission warned Tuesday.
	   ``Some cunning entrepreneurs have been collecting voter
signatures to sell them to interested candidates,'' Alexander
Ivanchenko said.
	   The results of several recent local elections in Russia had to
be canceled when winners were found to have criminal connections or
criminal records.
	   ``Elections are turning into a low farce. Elections are turning
into a dispute between big and very big money,'' prominent liberal
lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky said Tuesday.
	   St. Petersburg governor Vladimir Yakovlev called on election
officials Tuesday to tighten security for Sunday's vote and
expressed concern over campaign violations, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The Russian newspaper Noviye Izvestia printed transcripts last
week of what it said were taped phone conversations linking
Yakovlev and organized crime _ and said Starovoitova had the tapes
in her possession before she was killed. Yakovlev has refused to
comment on the article.
	   Starovoitova's death had all the trademarks of a contract hit,
which have become common in Russia and are rarely solved. Many of
the killings are related to business disputes, but Starovoitova had
no known business interests. She was also perhaps Russia's most
prominent female political figure.

on Galatasaray; Italian ministers to attend &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Authorities assigned more than 20,000
policemen to a politically charged Champions League match Wednesday
pitting Juventus of Italy against Turkey's Galatasaray.
	   ``We will do our best to start and finish the game without any
incidents,'' Interior Minister Kutlu Aktas told reporters Tuesday.
``Everyone should know that this is a sports competition.''
	   The tight security measures are intended to protect Juventus
players from any possible acts by Turks angry at Italy for refusing
to extradite a Kurdish rebel leader.
	   Because Turkey has the death penalty, Italy has refused to
return Abdullah Ocalan, who was arrested in Rome on Nov. 12
Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, has been fighting for
autonomy in southeastern Turkey for 14 years and the Turkish
government holds him responsible for thousands of deaths.
	   Aktas said that police will use a heavy hand against
troublemakers, warning that ``whoever gets involved in provocative
acts will be severely punished.''
	   Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz called on Turks to keep their calm
and dignity.
	   Private NTV television said some 22,000 policemen were assigned
to the match. Aktas said military units would also be called in.
	   The game will be played after a one-week postponement by
European soccer's governing body UEFA for security concerns.
Tension has declined since then.
	   Mass circulation dailies also called on the fans to stay calm.
	   ``Welcome Juve,'' headlined the daily Hurriyet in Italian,
saying Turks would put to shame those who have said Turkey was
unsafe by showing ``maturity and hospitality.''
	   NTV said police would search spectators entering the Ali Sami
Yen stadium for knives and clubs. Banners and fireworks are also
banned.
	   Roads to be used by Juventus players will be cordoned off, daily
Milliyet said.
	   But it was not clear if the measures would ease Juventus'
concerns.
	   Juventus general director Luiciano Moggi said Monday that they
``will not be going calmly,'' to Istanbul.
	   In a concession to the players' misgivings, the club announced
it would fly to Istanbul hours before the game and depart
immediately after the match. Juventus had planned to head to
Istanbul on Tuesday.
	   Several Juventus players, including French World Cup hero
Zinedine Zidane, had threatened to refuse to play in Istanbul.
	   ``We were kind of forced to go to play. We're very worried,''
Juventus 'keeper Angelo Peruzzi said Monday. ``UEFA and the Italian
and Turkish governments know that they have taken on a big
responsibility.''
	   Prior to the UEFA postponement, demonstrators set fire to a Fiat
car, a motorbike and numerous Italian flags.
	   Italy's ministers of sport and culture and of foreign trade said
they were going to Istanbul for the match.
	   Galatasaray has accused UEFA of favoring the Italian team by
postponing the game and allegedly giving injured Juventus players
time to recover.
	   Galatasaray coach Fatih Terim vowed to defeat Juve.
	   ``Hopefully, we will write history,'' sports daily Foto Mac
quoted Terim as saying Tuesday. ``Italians will return empty
handed.''
	   Romanian striker Gheorghe Hagi of Galatasaray was more cautious.
	   ``Ignoring Juventus' power would be suicide,'' Hagi said.
	   Galatasaray has seven points in Group B, one behind Norway's
Rosenborg. Juventus has four, but both teams have played one fewer
game than the Norwegians.

French allying with NASA to explore Mars
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France is teaming up with NASA to explore Mars in
2005, with plans to use a large new European rocket to send up the
U.S. orbiter as well as a French spacecraft to bring back soil
samples, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   A memorandum of understanding is to be signed shortly on the
joint effort to study the red planet, Le Monde reported, quoting
aides to Claude Allegre, the minister for education and research.
	   Allegre described the project in a speech to the National
Assembly Monday, with NASA contributing about 11 billion francs
(dlrs 2 billion) and France 2.5 billion francs (dlrs 450 million),
Le Monde said.
	   ``We will be present in this great adventure,'' Allegre said.
``We have signed an accord with the Americans,'' he said, referring
to ``letters of intention'' exchanged last spring.
	   As a young geologist in the 1970s studied soil samples U.S.
astronauts brought back from the moon, Allegre has long been a
supporter of space exploration.
	   But the move is also seen as a way to maintain France as
Europe's leader in space exploration, Le Monde said.
	   The French-based European Space Agency, whose commercial arm
Arianespace is the world's leader in commercial launches, has
developed a new, larger rocket called the Ariane 5.
	   That rocket, valued at 800 million francs (dlrs 143 million), is
to carry the U.S. orbiter that is to send up the U.S. orbiter in
August 2005.
	   France, ``with strong European participation,'' Allegre said,
will also contribute the ``Netlander'' -- four small probes
weighing about 50 kilograms (110 pounds) each.
	   Built with help from Germany and Finland, they are to conduct
geochemical, geophysical tests as well as monitor seismic movement.
	   The joint project was in the planning stage over the past year,
beginning in October 1997 when visiting NASA chief Daniel Goldin
asked France to contribute an Ariane 5.
	   Since then, French and American experts have met in both
countries, including at Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
Calif., where French scientists were visiting this week, Le Monde
said.

Split decision in Quebec; separatists re-elected, but with tepid

	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Like ambivalent boxing judges, Quebec voters
gave their combative politicians a split decision: the
pro-independence government gets another term in power, but with
support so tepid that a secession bid is unlikely any time soon.
	   The separatist Parti Quebecois retained a large legislative
majority in Monday's provincial election, winning 75 of the 125
seats to earn a new term of up to five years.
	   But the anti-separatist Quebec Liberal Party, though winning
only 48 seats, received 44 percent of the popular vote to 43
percent for the Parti Quebecois.
	   As a result, Liberal leader Jean Charest sounded more buoyant in
his remarks to supporters than Premier Lucien Bouchard, the
separatist leader, did in his victory speech.
	   ``The result tonight ... reflects the fact that the people of
Quebec, like the people of all Canada, want this country of ours to
work and be a success,'' said Charest, who will serve as opposition
leader in the provincial legislature.
	   The split decision stems from the geographical distribution of
political support in Quebec.
	   Anti-separatist support is concentrated in about 40 districts,
mostly around multiethnic Montreal, where the Liberals can rack up
huge victory margins. The separatists, whose backing comes almost
entirely from Quebec's French-speaking majority, are competitive in
a much larger number of districts spread across the province.
	   Bouchard, 59, had campaigned on the pledge that he would _ if
returned to power _ call for a referendum on seceding from Canada
whenever he felt conditions were right for a separatist victory.
	   But with only 43-percent support for his party, Bouchard is
likely to shelve any immediate push for a referendum and
concentrate instead on policies that will build public confidence.
	   ``There is no question that this vote was a vote to elect a
government, not a vote to determine the future of Quebec or the
future of the country,'' said Brian Tobin, the premier of
Newfoundland.
	   ``I wouldn't expect with these results that Mr. Bouchard will be
thinking of a referendum any time soon, if ever.''
	   Bouchard paid tribute to his opponents' determination and
pledged to work with them on policy matters. But he also promised
to work for the ``winning conditions'' that would make independence
possible eventually.
	   ``Our first priority is to advance Quebec ... to push it farther
toward its destiny,'' he said.
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
reaffirmed U.S. support for an undivided Canada.
	   ``The United States recognizes this is an internal issue for
Canadians to resolve within their constitutional, legal and
political system,'' he said. ``We have always valued our close and
productive relationship with a strong and united Canada.''
	   Canada's federal government kept a low profile during the 33-day
campaign, not wanting to undercut Charest in a province where many
francophones are traditionally wary of federal intentions.
	   Prime Minister Jean Chretien assured Bouchard of cooperation in
helping strengthen Quebec's economy and social services.
	   ``But when he talks about bringing together his famous winning
conditions, which he refuses to reveal, to hold another referendum
on separation, he should know we will defend our country,''
Chretien said.
	   As a personality, the charismatic Bouchard is by far the most
popular politician in Quebec. But many Quebeckers who voted for his
party are not keen on secession; recent polls indicated about 70
percent didn't want another referendum.
	   One of the most notable results of the election was the strong
showing of Democratic Action, the No. 3 party that drew 12 percent
of the vote behind its 28-year-old leader, Mario Dumont. The party,
which appeals to many young voters, favors greater autonomy for
Quebec but stops short of advocating outright secession.
	   ``Mr. Bouchard's mandate is clear _ to provide good government
and represent Quebec's interests,'' Dumont said. ``He was not
elected to do a referendum on sovereignty. Quebeckers want
constitutional peace.''
	   The separatists have lost two previous secession referendums, by
a big margin in 1980 and a narrow margin in 1995.
	   Bouchard is intent on avoiding a third defeat, and won a power
struggle with party hard-liners earlier this year by insisting he
would call another referendum only if opinion polls showed the
separatists would win.
	   About 80 percent of the 5.2 million eligible voters cast ballots
in Monday's election, high by North American standards but down
from 93 percent for the 1995 referendum.
	   About 83 percent of Quebec's 7.4 million people are French
speakers. The rest are divided among English-speakers with
long-term roots in Canada and more recently arrived immigrants from
southern Europe, Asia and elsewhere.
	   The long-term crusade for Quebec independence stems from a
feeling among many French Quebeckers that their culture is
different from the rest of Canada, plus a yearning to manage their
own affairs and have their own national symbols.

<TEXT>
	   DIYARBAKIR, Turkey (AP) _ An 18-year-old woman set off a hand
grenade strapped to her body Tuesday in a busy shopping street,
killing herself and injuring nine people, said the governor of this
province in the heart of the 14-year-old Kurdish war for autonomy.
	   Nafiz Kayali, governor of Diyarbakir province, refused to say
whether the woman was a Kurdish rebel, Anatolia, a Turkish news
agency reported.
	   Female Kurdish militants have in the past carried out suicide
bomb attacks in Turkey.
	   The blast occurred in the town of Lice, in southeastern Turkey.
	   Private television NTV reported that one of the injured was a
soldier.
	   The attack could discredit claims by rebel Kurdish leader,
Abdullah Ocalan, who was detained in Rome last month, that the
group is renouncing violence in the struggle for autonomy for
Kurds.
	   Last month, a Kurdish woman died setting off a bomb near a
military garrison that wounded two others.
	   The Turkish army is currently conducting a large-scale operation
against the rebels in southeast Turkey and neighboring northern
Iraq, NTV reported.
	   The army intensified its operations, sending in warplanes to
bomb rebel hideouts, following the downing of a military helicopter
by the rebels Friday, NTV said. Sixteen soldiers were killed in the
crash.
	   Despite Ocalan's call for a cease-fire on Sept. 1, PKK rebels
had been carried out close to 200 operations, the Germany-based
pro-Kurdish news agency DEM said.
	   DEM also claimed that the Turkish forces had burned down 36
villages populated mainly by Kurds in the past three months.
	   The military have in the past been accused of destroying
villages that allegedly harbored rebel forces.
	   Close to 37,000 people have been killed since Ocalan's group
began fighting in 1984.

Helicopter rescues TV crew trapped on Arctic island
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ While snow squalls whipped across the desolate
Arctic landscape, a Russian helicopter emerged from the dusky
winter light Tuesday and rescued a TV crew that had been stranded
on a remote island for weeks by bad weather.
	   The three-man crew _ a Russian, a Japanese and an Australian who
had been making a documentary on polar bears _ had three days' food
left when the helicopter airlifted them from Wrangel Island to the
port of Pevek, the Ministry of Emergency Situations said.
	   They had waited for weeks for the skies to clear up enough so
that a helicopter could land. The temperature on Wrangel Island has
been around minus 22 degrees, and the Arctic days never get
brighter than twilight.
	   ``We were filming polar bears and other animals,'' Nikita
Ovsyannikov told Russian television channel NTV. ``On Oct. 15, we
completed the work, and a flight was ordered to take us back.''
	   ``But this year the weather conditions were very unusual: heavy,
long cyclones, the weather was constantly bad, with powerful
blizzards. So the flight couldn't arrive,'' he said.
	   The three then holed up in a cabin on the island's northeast
coast, about 350 miles west of Alaska.
	   Japanese crew member Tatsuhiko Kobayashi developed complications
from a recent eye operation, but the others were in good health,
Russia's ORT television reported.
	   Weather in Russia's Arctic has been particularly severe this
year. A nuclear-powered ice-breaking ship was stranded for several
days last week, unable to cut a channel for a Finnish tanker that
carried badly needed fuel to residents of Russia's northeast
Chukotka peninsula, not far from Wrangel Island.
	   ``It wasn't easy to find pilots,'' said Dean Finlay of the
emergency company AEA International SOS. ``Also, there was only a
three-hour daytime window in the area, and just over two hours of
flight time, so they had to get the window just right.''
	   It took the crew about an hour to load the 880 pounds of
equipment and film aboard. Then they traveled back in the already
black Arctic night.
	   ``It was an anxious couple of hours,'' said John Hyde, a
television producer who helped coordinate the rescue.
	   There were conflicting reports on who organized the rescue.
Emergency Situations Ministry spokesman Viktor Beltsov said the
rescue was organized by his agency using an Mi-8 helicopter hired
from a private airline.
	   But AEA International SOS said it had organized the rescue,
according to Mark Crawford, the company's spokesman in Australia.
He said his company had been hired by the filmmakers' employer,
Natural History Pty. Ltd., in New Zealand.
	   ``They're in fair spirits,'' Crawford said of the crew.
``They're surviving, of course, but they were down to their last
three days of food.''
	   Kobayashi is an employee of NHK, the Japanese television
company. The Australian is cameraman John McGuiness. All three crew
members were expected to fly to Moscow on Wednesday.

Honduras lowers Mitch death toll to 5,657
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	    &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Honduras restoring civil
liberties, judge saying pilot caused helicopter crash that killed
mayor.
 &UR; By JULIE WATSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Honduras announced Tuesday that it
suspended a governor for inflating her region's death toll from
Hurricane Mitch, and lowered its official death count by 1,350
people.
	   The new death toll of 5,657 was compiled after the government
sent teams to verify reports from regions across Honduras, the
Interior Secretariat said Tuesday.
	   The governor, Lucila Esperanza Barahona de Castro of the Santa
Barbara region in remote northwestern Honduras, was suspended after
investigators could verify only 282 of the 1,159 deaths reported in
her area.
	   Authorities said the suspension was standard procedure during an
inquiry.
	   Barahona told The Associated Press she couldn't have falsified
the numbers because she didn't even give a death toll to the
federal government.
	   ``I don't know what source gave them the numbers,'' she said
Tuesday.
	   In addition to the 5,657 dead, Honduras said it had verified
8,058 missing, 12,272 injured and 1.4 million homeless throughout
the country.
	   Aid workers and journalists began questioning Honduras'
estimated death toll after figures jumped drastically Nov. 2, the
same day that news broke of a landslide in Nicaragua that covered
two villages and killed up to 2,000 people.
	   That day, Honduras' official death toll jumped from 600 to
5,000. Later, authorities raised the figure to 6,400, then last
week to 7,007.
	   Luis Torres, spokesman for the committee overseeing the relief
effort, told The Associated Press that ``all the information is
being verified by the mayors' offices, the army, the police, public
and private rescue groups and the authorities of the 18 provinces
of the country.''
	   The revised figure from Honduras lowers the overall death toll
in Central America from Hurricane Mitch to 9,071.
	   Meanwhile, Honduras' legislature restored its bill of rights,
which was suspended Nov. 2 when flooding from Mitch sparked looting
and banditry, and ended an 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. Lawmakers said
the emergency had been overcome.
	   The government also reversed its explanation for a helicopter
crash that killed the overwhelmingly popular mayor of the capital,
Cesar Castellanos, a 50-year-old neurosurgeon who was considered
the top candidate to become Honduras' next president.
	   Officials had blamed mechanical failure, but said Tuesday that
human error caused the crash, which occurred while Castellanos was
surveying hurricane damage.
	   ``Pilot Jose Miranda caused the tragedy when he made an
unplanned maneuver, which caused the craft the crash into
high-tension cables and fall to the ground,'' Judge Dagoberto Aspra
said Tuesday.
	   He spoke after listening to audiotapes of communications between
the pilot and the control tower.
	   Miranda was also killed in the crash.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Activists across the globe
marched in the streets, distributed condoms and held benefit
concerts Tuesday to try to halt the spread of AIDS, which will kill
millions of people this year alone.
	   Underscoring events on World AIDS Day was this sobering fact:
Although powerful new medicines are helping industrialized
countries win the battle against the disease, it has reached
epidemic proportions in continents where people can't afford the
drugs.
	   About 33.4 million people around the world are infected with
HIV, two-thirds of them in sub-Saharan Africa. In Asia and the
Pacific, 700,000 people become infected with HIV per year.
	   In sub-Saharan Africa, the 1998 death toll from AIDS is expected
to be 2 million. Nearly 6 million more people will become infected
this year _ 1.7 million of them in sub-Saharan Africa.
	   ``In the case of HIV/AIDS, the difference in wealth becomes
literally matter of life and death,'' decried Mary Robinson, the
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.
	   From bars in Hong Kong to parks in South Africa, activists
preached safe sex. People pinned red ribbons on lapels to express
solidarity in the fight against AIDS. In San Juan, Puerto Rico,
more than 3,000 people formed a human red ribbon.
	   ``It's important to be here, to urge people to say `No' to AIDS
and to protect themselves,'' said Carlos Baerga, a free agent
baseball player most recently with the New York Mets. Those whose
loved ones died from AIDS planned to toss carnations into the
Atlantic Ocean in their memory.
	   _ In India, where up to 5 million people are HIV positive,
hundreds of schoolchildren marched beside prostitutes in New Delhi
to draw attention to the epidemic.
	   _ Israelis and Palestinians handed out condoms and literature to
passengers departing Israel's international airport in Tel Aviv.
	   _ In Ivory Coast, thousands of children wearing T-shirts with
anti-AIDS slogans and bouncing inflated condoms like beach balls
marched through the streets of Abidjan.
	   _ In Kenya, children wearing black T-Shirts that said ``Stop
AIDS'' distributed condoms and pamphlets on AIDS prevention in
Dandora, an eastern Nairobi slum.
	   _ In Hong Kong's nightspots, activists handed out coasters with
pictures of a condom on one side and a safe-sex message on the
other.
	   _ In Tokyo, Japan's Health Ministry held rallies and concerts in
a central square.
	   _ In Moscow, a contraceptive company's employees sheathed in
red, yellow or green ``condom suits'' handed out condoms in Pushkin
Square.
	   _ In Pretoria, South Africa, clowns painted red AIDS ribbons on
people's faces as drum majorettes entertained a crowd.
	   Underneath it all was a life-and-death message: Practice safe
sex or face the consequences.
	   ``Come and witness the reality of AIDS. See the devastation in
our community. See the fresh graves,'' South African President
Nelson Mandela told hundreds of people in a village in
KwaZulu-Natal province, where an estimated 25 percent of adults are
infected with HIV.
	   But considering the enormity of the problem, the call to action
worldwide was muted.
	   In some countries like Zimbabwe, where an estimated 23 percent
of the population is infected with HIV, World AIDS day passed with
little fanfare. Countries in southern Africa have been slow to
recognize the unfolding tragedy and have little resources to fight
it.
	   It was only in October that the South African government
launched an AIDS awareness program. Already, more than 3 million
South Africans are infected. This year an estimated 168,000 have
died from AIDS.
	   The vast majority of those infected in Africa and other
developing regions cannot afford the drugs that are prolonging life
among AIDS patients in the West.
	   In Washington, President Bill Clinton announced dlrs 10 million
in emergency grants to help children orphaned by AIDS in poorer
nations. Much more assistance would be needed to help turn the
tide.
	   Robinson, the top human rights official at the U.N., said: ``The
current situation is an indictment of the international allocation
of resources to fight HIV/AIDS in developing nations.''

	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Juventus top manager Luciano Moggi on
Tuesday defended as ``well-grounded'' the club decision to stay a
single day in Istanbul for the politically-tinged Champions League
match against Turkey's Galatasaray.
	   The Italian league champions, who need a victory against the
Turkish team to keep qualifying chances alive in the most titled
European soccer competition, decided to travel to Istanbul on match
day Wednesday and return home immediately after the game.
	   UEFA, Europe's soccer governing body which requires teams to
arrive the day before European Cup matches, was critical of
Juventus decision.
	   ``Juventus feels there are well-grounded motives for failing to
conform to UEFA directives,'' said Moggi, the general director of
the Turin team, which is owned by the Agnelli family of auto
tycoons.
	   Juventus confirmed on Tuesday its travel plans for the match
which was already postponed by one week after Italy's refusal to
extradite a Kurdish rebel leader prompted anti-Italian
demonstrations in Turkey.
	   Several Juventus players, who had initially refused to travel to
Instanbul, bowed to the club decision to play Galatasaray but
criticized the UEFA stand.
	   ``We have been forced to play a game conditioned by political
motives,'' said No. 1 keeper Angelo Peruzzi.
	   Team captain Antonio Conte said Tuesday that the Italian
government and UEFA left the Italian team alone.
	   ``UEFA and the (Italian) government have claimed that there are
no security problems in Istanbul ... but as far as we know no UEFA
and government representatives will be in Istanbul Wednesday,''
Conte told the Italian news agency ANSA.
	   Later, however, Italy's minister of sports and culture, Giovanna
Melandri, said she was going to the game.
	   ``I'm convinced that sports must always and in any case
represent a moment of encounter. I hope I'll be attending a great
match,'' Melandri was quoted as saying.
	   Another Italian minister, holding the foreign trade portfolio,
also was planning to attend.
	   Anti-Italian sentiment in Turkey over the Ocalan issue raised
fears among Italian business owners that Turks might boycott
Italian goods.

Former Miss Universe stays in presidential race despite being
</HEADLINE>
dumped by party &QL; 
 &UR; By BART JONES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ A former Miss Universe said Tuesday
she will stay in the race to become Venezuela's next president
despite losing the backing of one of the country's major political
parties.
	   Irene Saez, 36, said she accepted Monday's decision by the
center-right COPEI party to throw its support to former state
governor Henrique Salas Romer, but would compete in next Sunday's
election as an independent.
	   ``I respect the decision and I return the card that never
belonged to me,'' Saez said, referring to COPEI's box on the
electoral ballot.
	   The move by COPEI was part of strategy to foil the presidential
aspirations of retired Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez, who led an abortive
coup in 1992. COPEI said Saez's candidacy threatened to divide the
anti-Chavez vote.
	   Fearing that Chavez would impose a dictatorship if elected,
COPEI and Venezuela's other major party, Democratic Action, have
closed ranks around Salas.
	   Over the weekend, Democratic Action also dropped its candidate,
77-year-old party stalwart Luis Alfaro, who is fighting the
decision.
	   Millions of Venezuela's poor see Chavez as a hero partly because
of his tough talk on corruption and his promises to slow down
free-market reforms.
	   Chavez's Patriotic Pole coalition won a plurality of seats in
Venezuela's Congress in Nov. 8 regional elections, prompting his
opponents to form a coalition of their own, dubbed the ``Democratic
Pole.''
	   Speaking to hundreds of supporters at her campaign headquarters
Tuesday, Saez said she laments the nation's increasing political
polarization.
	   ``We are all democratic and we are all patriotic. We are one
people,'' Saez said.
	   She acknowledged she has little chance of winning, but said she
wants to give voters an alternative for democratic change.
	   Saez, a 6-foot-1 (1.85-meter) strawberry blonde who was Miss
Universe 1981, had led the polls for months. As mayor of affluent
Chacao municipality in Caracas, she built a reputation as an honest
and efficient politician.
	   But sugary slogans, confusion among her campaign team and her
decision to accept COPEI's backing has seen her popularity plummet
in recent polls.

Former security chief confirms Romania-Iraq talks on missile

technology

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A former head of Romanian intelligence
on Tuesday said Iraq expressed interest in Romania's missile
technology three years ago but bilateral talks were inconclusive
and did not result in sales to Baghdad.
	   Reacting to media reports that Romania provided Iraq with
missile components, Virgil Magureanu, who headed the Romanian
Information Service between 1990 and 1997, said the two countries
held talks in 1995.
	   ``I don't know how far the negotiations went, but they were
stopped'' after the United States asked Romania to end them, he
told the Mediafax news agency. No weapons were sold, he reportedly
said.
	   Earlier, Foreign Affairs Ministry spokeswoman Carmen Podgoreanu
denied media reports that diplomats had confirmed Iraq-Romania
missile talks. Other government officials refused comment.

Russian tax police find 15,000 violations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's tax police found 15,471 tax violations in
the first 10 months of this year and sentenced 998 people for tax
dodging, officials said Tuesday.
	   The Federal Tax Police also said they had confiscated 18 million
liters (4.7 million gallons) of illegally produced alcohol from
January to October, worth 500 million rubles (dlrs 27 million), the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Tax evasion is widespread in Russia, which has aggravated the
country's financial troubles. Russian cash-strapped government has
been trying to tighten control over the lucrative alcohol business,
saying it would be a crucial way of collecting more taxes.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet left
a north London psychiatric hospital Tuesday evening, driven away in
darkness to a house on an estate of magnificent houses in an
ambulance in a convoy headed by police vehicles.
	   To chants of ``We want justice'' from demonstrators, some
shaking their fists, the ambulance swept through the gates of
Grovelands Priory at 6.45 p.m. (1845GMT), a day after the hospital
announced that the 83-year-old general does not need medical care,
and demanded that he leave.
	   An hour later the white ambulance with blacked out windows
arrived at Wentworth estate in Surrey, some 20 miles (30 kms) west
of central London.
	   A police helicopter circled overhead as the convoy drew into the
estate of huge homes set in private grounds _ many overlooking the
fairways of Wentworth Golf Club, home of the European golf tour.
	   Dozens of police arrived at roads leading into the estate and
said they'd been ordered to say nothing.
	   Monday's statement by the hospital, where Pinochet has been
since Oct. 29, dealt a blow to any plan he had to plead he is too
ill to be extradited to Spain to stand trial on charges of genocide
and torture.
	   If Home Secretary Jack Straw, who must rule by Dec. 11, allows
extradition proceedings to begin, Pinochet will likely be in
Britain for months fighting his case through the courts.
	   His new neighbors face disruption. Chilean exiles mount
demonstrations, and there is a police guard and heavy police
presence.

James Stewart's service unform to go on display at British museum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAMBRIDGE, England (AP) _ One of Hollywood legend James
Stewart's Air Force uniforms will go on display at a British air
museum.
	   The uniform, donated by the late actor's family, will be
presented among historic American combat aircraft at the Duxford
Imperial War Museum at Cambridge, the museum said Tuesday.
	   Stewart was already an Oscar-winning star when he flew 20 combat
missions in World War II, based at Tibenham, England, northeast of
London. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the
French Croix de Guerre.
	   He resumed his screen career after the war and made a total of
80 films, the best known of which is the holiday classic, ``It's a
Wonderful Life.''
	   ``Jimmy Stewart was a great friend of Duxford,'' museum director
Ted Inman said. ``He helped greatly fund raising for the American
Air Museum, and we were sad he was never able to see the fruit of
his works. This uniform, on show to Duxford's 450,000 visitors each
year, will remind us all that James Stewart was not only a fine
actor but also a brave aviator who flew on perilous daylight
missions from Britain.''
	   The museum didn't say when the uniform would go on display.

IMF head in Moscow for talks on loans

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With Russian leaders urgently seeking financial
help, International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus came to
Moscow today for two days of talks on Russia's frozen loan
agreement with the IMF.
	   Camdessus was to meet Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov later
today, and is scheduled to hold broader talks with government
officials Wednesday.
	   President Boris Yeltsin, who is in a hospital being treated for
pneumonia, spoke with Primakov by telephone today about the talks
with Camdessus.
	   In the Netherlands, meanwhile, former Russian Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin sought to reassure international investors that
Russia would survive its economic problems.
	   He told an international business conference that his country's
economic woes were ``far from desperate,'' adding: ``European
companies are still with us. They are not leaving Russia.''
	   Russia is seeking further installments on an IMF bailout package
that was reached in the summer, but was held up after the
government devalued the ruble and defaulted on some of its debts in
August. The IMF has said Russia must come up with a realistic
recovery plan before more money will be released.
	   Camdessus is not expected to announce any breakthroughs, but his
visit gives Russia an opportunity to make its case and lobby for
fresh funds.
	   The bailout package totals $22.6 billion and also involves the
World Bank and the Japanese government, but Russia has so far
received only about $5 billion.
	   An IMF mission left town last week saying the government's
revenue forecast for next year was overly optimistic. It also
disapproved of the government's intention to lower taxes and offer
subsidies to ailing industries.
	   If the Russian government doesn't receive foreign help soon, it
will probably have to start printing money, which would drive up
inflation.
	   ``I hope that the IMF would be able to make a decision to
provide aid to Russia that would allow us to avoid
hyperinflation,'' Oleg Sysuyev, a top presidential aide, was quoted
as saying today by the Interfax news agency.
	   The government has been delaying a debate on next year's budget
as it struggles to find ways to come up with enough money to meet
its expenses. The Cabinet again delayed the discussion this week,
but insisted the delay was not connected with Camdessus' visit.
	   However, the Russian media claimed the government put off action
on the budget because it is still hoping for the IMF loans.
	   ``Everyone understands that budget parameters remain vague, and
their clarification depends on Camdessus' visit,'' the business
daily Kommersant said today.
	   Former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, who was on a trip to the
United States this week, said Russia wouldn't be able to pay $17.5
billion in foreign debt that comes due next year.
	   ``The IMF must realize that and accept compromises with Russia
in reaching agreements on restructuring foreign debts,'' Kiriyenko
said at New York University on Monday, according to the Interfax
news agency.

Repairs at Chernobyl nuclear reactor delayed over energy shortages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine is so short of energy that it could
not afford Tuesday to temporarily shut down the Chernobyl nuclear
power plant for repairs.
	   Earlier this month, Ukraine's Nuclear Regulation Administration
ordered the plant's only working reactor be temporarily stopped,
warning that some safety equipment was reaching the end of its
operational life and needed to be upgraded or replaced.
	   But a spokesman for the state nuclear energy company Energoatom
said Tuesday that the reactor will stay active until at least Dec.
15. By then, other nuclear reactors undergoing repairs are set to
be restarted.
	   Nuclear Regulation Administration chief Oleksander Smyshliaev
said his agency decided to grant Energoatom's request to prolong
the reactor's work, but stressed that it had to be stopped as soon
as possible.
	   Another Chernobyl reactor was destroyed in a 1986 explosion and
fire, the world's worst nuclear accident. Since then, there have
been frequent malfunctions at the one remaining reactor despite
lengthy repairs between July 1997 and May 1998.
	   The Energy Ministry has repeatedly protested the order to shut
down the reactor, saying it is needed until the spring to ensure
enough electricity for the winter months.
	   Energoatom warned Monday that the shutdown of the Chernobyl
reactor would force energy authorities to cut off entire regions of
the country.
	   Ukraine faces a huge energy deficit this winter because
conventional energy plants, which are owed more than $1 billion by
consumers, can't afford enough fuel to satisfy the demand for
electricity and heat.
	   Thousands of towns and villages in Ukraine already go without
electricity for several hours every day as temperatures throughout
much of the country have sunk below zero.
	   Western nations have long demanded the shutdown of the working
Chernobyl reactor amid growing worries over its safety.

European Central Bank calls for confidence in single currency

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Duisenberg news conference &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Germany-France &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Europe's top central banker Tuesday
called on Europeans to have faith in their future, saying a lack of
confidence was a major risk to the economy ahead of the Jan. 1
launch of the euro common currency.
	   Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank, said
sagging growth and a year of market volatility had already shaken
corporate confidence in Europe. And his plea for support appeared
to reflect analysts' concerns that the euro is being launched at a
difficult time.
	   Growth in Europe is falling. Coupled with the danger of falling
prices _ or deflation _ the scenario could result in recession,
though that danger is far off.
	   The European Central Bank will set monetary policy for the 11
euro nations as soon as the currency is launched. With some euro
nations pushing for lower interest rates to help curb unemployment,
the bank may have a tough job ahead.
	   Growth may achieve just 2.5 percent in in 1999, compared to
earlier expectations of 3 percent, Duisenberg said. And despite
``calmer conditions'' on world financial markets in November, he
called for caution, saying the economy could still worsen.
	   The central bank must ``be at the helm right from the beginning.
There will be no mercy'' from financial markets, worried about
falling growth and the potential for deflation, said Adolf
Rosenstock, economist at Nomura.
	   The bank is being watched most keenly for how it will determine
a common interest rate for the so-called ``euro zone.'' Duisenberg
acknowledged that the interest rate discussion was ``intensifying
and deepening and livening up'' but _ as widely expected _ did not
reveal the rate.
	   Many analysts expect it to be at or around Germany's 3.3
percent, though some think the bank will set it at 3 percent to
boost growth in Europe.
	   Duisenberg also touched on the ECB's independence from
politicians _ the most sensitive issue facing the bank and one that
stems from the interest rate debate.
	   Germany repeatedly has urged the bank to drop interest rates to
boost economies and help governments cut unemployment, standing
Europe-wide at 9.9 percent. The ECB says its job is to keep prices
steady and inflation low, not to tinker with monetary policy to
achieve broader economic goals.
	   Pressure only grew Tuesday as leaders of Germany and France
agreed to strengthen efforts to fight unemployment and boost the
economy.
	   While Duisenberg said the bank wanted governments to reform
labor markets to increase employment and boost growth, he said it
was prepared to cooperate in other ways. He did not give specifics.
	   ``Without prejudice to price stability, our policy should and
will contribute to the other economic goals,'' he said.
	   Duisenberg chided governments for not doing enough to produce
budget surpluses and reduce debt levels, which he said ``are still
at a very high level.''
	   ``These are risks endangering the credibility of the euro and
the objective of price stability'' in the future euro area,
Duisenberg said.
	   With the Jan. 1 euro launch imminent, analysts have said the ECB
is under increasing pressure to spell out its policies. Duisenberg,
who spoke after a meeting of the ECB's governing council, announced
the bank would aim to keep money supply growth in the economy at
4.5 percent, roughly meeting expectations.
	   The bank's governing council consists of 11 central bank chiefs
from the countries launching the euro, plus a Frankfurt-based
directorate of six. Tuesday was the council's next to last
scheduled meeting before the currency launch.

Top clubs agree on new UEFA Cup format
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ UEFA and several of Europe's top clubs on Tuesday
agreed to a new format for the UEFA Cup which will give
unsuccessful Champions League competitors a second chance.
	   The revamped competition would merge the existing UEFA Cup and
Cup Winners Cup and start with 96 teams _ the combined total of the
current competitons, UEFA's European Football 2000 Task Force
decided.
	   If UEFA's Executive Committee approves the proposal, the eight
teams that finish third in their European Champions League groups
will join the new UEFA Cup in its third round.
	   Under the new Champions League format, the first- and
second-placed teams from all eight groups would advance to a
two-leg, single-elimination second round before the quarterfinal
stage.
	   ``It means we have more quality,'' UEFA General Secretary
Gerhard Aigner told reporters.
	   The cup will have one qualifying round. An alternative proposal
with a smaller starting lineup would have required three summer
qualifying rounds.
	   Under the proposal, countries whose teams reach the UEFA Cup
quarterfinals will receive an extra berth in the following season's
competition.
	   The group also discussed the financial structure of the revamped
Champions League.
	   In October, representatives of AC Milan, Real Madrid and 10
other major teams agreed not to join a breakaway Super League after
UEFA promised to extend next season's European Champions' League
from 24 teams to 32, playing in eight groups of four in the first
stage.
	   Clubs agreed Tuesday that 5 percent of the money they receive
from the new competition should go to the leagues of participating
teams, Aigner said.
	   The money would be distributed to clubs which don't qualify for
European competitions and ``must be used for education of young
players,'' he added.
	   UEFA expects the new-look Champions League to generate about 800
million francs (dlrs 570 million). Approximately 75 percent would
be distributed to clubs under both the current system of match and
performance fees and the clubs' market value.
	   UEFA's Executive Committee is expected to give final approval to
the revamped competitions and decide on a starting date for them
when it meets next week in Lausanne, Switzerland.
	   ``We have set the sails for a start next season,'' Aigner said.

Chinese police detain dissidents in crackdown on illegal party

	   BEIJING (AP) _ In an apparent attempt to crush a budding
opposition party, Chinese police have detained two of China's most
prominent dissidents and three other democracy campaigners, a human
rights group and relatives of those taken into custody said
Tuesday.
	   Police in two cities descended on the homes of Xu Wenli, Qin
Yongmin and other members of the China Democracy Party on Monday
night and took them away, relatives and the rights group said.
	   The police action was one of the harshest since dissidents
announced the formation of the would-be opposition group in June to
challenge the ruling Communist Party's monopoly on power. Since
then, police have questioned, briefly detained and harassed the
activists but refrained from filing charges.
	   Signaling the leadership's resolve to quash any challenges, the
party's No. 2, legislative chairman Li Peng, was quoted Tuesday as
saying that Western-style democracy was inappropriate for China and
opposition groups would not be tolerated.
	   If organizations seek ``the multi-party system and try to negate
the leadership of the Communist Party, then they will not be
allowed to exist,'' Li told the German business daily,
Handelsblatt, in an interview carried by China's official Xinhua
News Agency.
	   Police on Tuesday informed the family of Qin Yongmin that he was
arrested for plotting to overthrow the government, the Hong
Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China said. The crime carries a maximum penalty of life
imprisonment.
	   In taking Xu Wenli from his home Monday night, police produced
an arrest warrant and a search warrant that identified him as a
criminal suspect, said his wife, He Xitong. Unlike previous
occasions when Xu was held only for short periods, she feared this
time authorities were planning to charge and convict him.
	   Twenty police officers ransacked their Beijing apartment,
seizing a computer, a fax machine, address books, video tapes, a
typewriter, more than 1,000 pages of documents and even a
telephone, she said.
	   ``Xu Wenli has already paid heavily for democracy. I understand
that he is ready to pay again,'' said his wife. ``Xu Wenli won't
give up.''
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
the United States views Xu's detention ''as a serious step in the
wrong direction,'' and added that U.S. officials have urged Chinese
authorities to release Xu immediately.
	   ''We have said for some weeks now that we are disturbed by the
recent number of detentions of dissidents that serve to limit
political debate in China,'' Rubin said.
	   He said Xu had been ''for peacefully exercising fundamental
freedoms guaranteed by international human rights instruments.''
	   Rubin offered no information on Qin's detention.
 &UR; Qin and Xu are among, pick up 10th graf pvs.

U.N. sends 2,500 tons of relief aid to southern civilians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMED OSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The United Nations World Food Program has
sent about 2,500 tons of relief aid for hungry civilians in
war-torn southern Sudan, a U.N. official said Tuesday.
	   A convoy of seven river barges carrying relief material left the
river port of Kosti, 300 kilometers (miles 195) south of Khartoum,
on Monday to distribute the aid to people along the Nile river, the
WFP representative in Khartoum, Mohammed Saleheen, said in a
statement.
	   The statement said WFP teams will distribute relief to some 33
locations under government and rebel control until the convoy
reaches the southern strategic town of Juba early January.
	   Juba, a provincial capital about 1,200 kilometers (744 miles)
south of the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, is the largest town in
southern Sudan still under government control.
	   Saleheen said the WFP intends to send more aid in the coming
months via the Nile as it is much cheaper than air transport.
	   The WFP used to drop 9,500 tons of food a month at a cost of
dlrs 30 million into the south in the world's largest aid
operation.
	   Aid workers estimate about 1.5 million people are facing severe
food shortages in southern Sudan, mainly in Bahr el-Ghazal
province, as a result of drought and fighting.
	   The government and the rebels agreed in October to extend by
three months a cease-fire to allow food to reach civilians caught
in the war with the rebels in the south.
	   Sudan has been embroiled in a civil war for 15 years, pitting
Christian and animist rebels fighting for more autonomy against the
government in the Muslim, Arab north. About 1.5 million people have
died in the war and famines caused by the fighting.

Juventus official defends travel plans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Melandri to attend match. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Juventus general director Luciano Moggi on
Tuesday defended as ``well grounded'' the club decision to travel
to Istanbul on game day for the politically tinged European
Champions League match against Galatasaray.
	   The Italian league champions, who need a victory to keep its
quarterfinal chances alive, have decided to travel to Istanbul on
Wednesday and return home immediately after the game.
	   UEFA, Europe's governing body for soccer, requires teams to
arrive the day before of European Cup matches and was critical of
Juventus' decision.
	   ``Juventus feels there are well grounded motives for failing to
conform to UEFA directives,'' Moggi sauid.
	   Juventus confirmed on Tuesday its travel plans for the match,
which was postponed by a week after anti-Italian demonstrations
erupted in Turkey over Italy's refusal to extradite Kurdish rebel
leader Abdullah Ocalan.
	   Several Juventus players, who had initially refused to travel to
Instanbul, bowed to the club decision to play Galatasaray but
criticized the UEFA stand.
	   ``We have been forced to play a game conditioned by political
motives,'' Juventus starting goalkeeper Angelo Peruzzi said.
	   Team captain Antonio Conte said Tuesday that the Italian
government and UEFA left the Italian team standing alone.
	   ``UEFA and the (Italian) government have claimed that there are
no security problems in Istanbul ... but as far as we know no UEFA
and government representatives will be in Istanbul Wednesday,''
Conte told the Italian news agency ANSA.
	   However, Italian culture minister Giovanna Melandri, who was
invited to attend the game by her Turkish counterpart, on Tuesday
afternoon accepted the offer and said she was going to the game.
	   ``I'm convinced that sports must always and in any case
represent a moment of encounter. I hope I'll be attending a great
match,'' Melandri was quoted as saying.
	   Anti-Italian sentiment in Turkey over the Ocalan issue raised
fears among Italian business owners that Turks might boycott
Italian goods.

Iraq says team tried to buy `permitted' missile parts in Romania
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with news conference by Saddam's
adviser denying Iraq tried to buy prohibited missile technology
from Romania; CHANGES byline, overline &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Monday denied it tried to buy
prohibited missile technology in Romania, but admitted sending a
team there to settle ``outstanding matters'' relating to an old
contract.
	   The team also was interested in ``some forging and
precision-casting technologies'' for short-range missiles that Iraq
is allowed to produce under U.N. Security Council resolutions, Lt.
Gen. Amer al-Saadi, a top adviser to President Saddam Hussein, told
reporters.
	   He was commenting on a report Monday by the Cable News Network
that Iraqi missile experts, escorted by Iraqi secret police, went
to Bucharest to negotiate the purchase of guidance equipment for
banned long-range missiles.
	   The report is ``regrettably tendentious, baseless and full of
distortions as part of the hostile media campaign against Iraq,''
al-Saadi said.
	   Iraq has over the years claimed that is has ended all programs
to build mass destruction weapons as required by Security Council
resolutions adopted after the 1991 Gulf War, which ended Iraq's
occupation of Kuwait.
	   However, the Iraqi claims are disputed by the U.N. Special
Commission, which is responsible for dismantling its chemical and
biological weapons and missiles with a range more than 150
kilometers (93 miles).
	   Until UNSCOM gives Iraq a clean bill of health, the Security
Council will not lift U.N. economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Al-Saadi said an Iraqi team did travel to Romania in May this
year ``but not for the purpose of obtaining prohibited material or
technology.''
	   ``The purpose was to settle outstanding matters regarding a
contract made in 1995 for materials, which was known to (UNSCOM)
and were subjected to ongoing monitoring by them,'' he said.
	   Al-Saadi is widely believed to be the mastermind of Iraq's
chemical and biological weapons program.
	   According to CNN, the Iraqi purchase in Bucharest was blocked
because spy agencies from the United States and two other
countries, which were not identified, uncovered the potential deal
and monitored the Iraqis' two-week visit.
	   CNN on Tuesday stood by its report, which had quoted unnamed
sources and Scott Ritter, an American ex-Marine who resigned as an
UNSCOM member in August after complaining that the U.S. government
was not being tough enough with Iraq.
	   Al-Saadi said UNSCOM was fully aware at the time that Iraq had a
legal project to develop short-range missiles and that UNSCOM has
constantly monitored and witnessed static and flight tests.
	   ``Scott Ritter ... is now trying to portray himself as a Rambo
style hero for personal reasons and to serve Israeli objectives,''
al-Saadi said.
	   Also Tuesday, the spokeswoman for the U.N. weapons inspectors
said the United Nations has brought its complement of 120 weapons
inspectors in Iraq up to full strength.
	   The inspectors returned to Baghdad last month after a brief
pull-out following Iraq's refusal to allow them to work. Iraq
relented on Nov. 14, only hours before U.S. military strikes were
to be launched.

IMF head in Moscow for talks on loans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 5 grafs to UPDATE with quotes from Chernomyrdin.
Picks up 4th graf pvs ``Russia is seeking...''  &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With Russian leaders urgently seeking financial
help, International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus came to
Moscow today for two days of talks on Russia's frozen loan
agreement with the IMF.
	   Camdessus was to meet Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov later
today, and is scheduled to hold broader talks with government
officials Wednesday.
	   President Boris Yeltsin, who is in a hospital being treated for
pneumonia, spoke with Primakov by telephone today about the talks
with Camdessus.
	   In the Netherlands, meanwhile, former Russian Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin sought to reassure international investors that
Russia would survive its economic problems.
	   He told an international business conference that his country's
economic woes were ``far from desperate,'' adding: ``European
companies are still with us. They are not leaving Russia.''
	   Russia is seeking further installments on an IMF bailout package
that was reached in the summer, but was held up after the
government devalued the ruble and defaulted on some of its debts in
August. The IMF has said Russia must come up with a realistic
recovery plan before more money will be released.
	   Camdessus is not expected to announce any breakthroughs, but his
visit gives Russia an opportunity to make its case and lobby for
fresh funds.
	   The bailout package totals $22.6 billion and also involves the
World Bank and the Japanese government, but Russia has so far
received only about $5 billion.
	   An IMF mission left town last week saying the government's
revenue forecast for next year was overly optimistic. It also
disapproved of the government's intention to lower taxes and offer
subsidies to ailing industries.
	   If the Russian government doesn't receive foreign help soon, it
will probably have to start printing money, which would drive up
inflation.
	   ``I hope that the IMF would be able to make a decision to
provide aid to Russia that would allow us to avoid
hyperinflation,'' Oleg Sysuyev, a top presidential aide, was quoted
as saying today by the Interfax news agency.
	   The government has been delaying a debate on next year's budget
as it struggles to find ways to come up with enough money to meet
its expenses. The Cabinet again delayed the discussion this week,
but insisted the delay was not connected with Camdessus' visit.
	   However, the Russian media claimed the government put off action
on the budget because it is still hoping for the IMF loans.
	   ``Everyone understands that budget parameters remain vague, and
their clarification depends on Camdessus' visit,'' the business
daily Kommersant said today.
	   Former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, who was on a trip to the
United States this week, said Russia wouldn't be able to pay $17.5
billion in foreign debt that comes due next year.
	   ``The IMF must realize that and accept compromises with Russia
in reaching agreements on restructuring foreign debts,'' Kiriyenko
said at New York University on Monday, according to the Interfax
news agency.

French rap singer charged in beating of stewardess
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ French rap singer Didier Morvic has
been charged with assault and is to appear in court later this
month after he allegedly attacked a stewardess and broke her nose,
police said Tuesday.
	   Morvic, alias ``Joey Starr'' of the group NTM, was accused of
striking the stewardess in the face early Sunday morning in a hotel
in this southern French town, police said on customary anonymity.
	   The stewardess, whose name and airline were not identified, was
attacked shortly before she was to work on a flight to Paris,
police said. There was no immediate word on what sparked the
attack.
	   The stewardess suffered ``crano-facial trauma with a nasal
fracture,'' forcing her to stay off the job for 12 days, said a
statement by France's National Airline Pilots Union, or SNPL.
	   The union condemned the incident, giving ``their complete
support to their attacked colleague and will join in the legal
action as a plaintiff'' when Staff appears in court Dec. 16.
	   The union also said it would call on its members to refuse to
allow Starr to take a plane in France.
	   NTM, or Nic Ta Mere, France's most controversial rap group, has
already faced legal action for lyrics attacking the police.

Five `Real IRA' suspects plead guilty to botched armed robbery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Five suspected Irish Republican Army
dissidents pleaded guilty Tuesday to committing a botched armed
robbery that ended after police shot dead one of their comrades.
	   The three judges presiding over Ireland's anti-terrorist Special
Criminal Court said they would pass sentence Wednesday on the four
men and a woman who admitted they ambushed an armored van
containing 250,000 pounds (dlrs 375,000) in May.
	   Anti-terrorist detectives had been keeping the gang under
surveillance as part of their efforts to suppress the so-called
Real IRA, a rump of dissidents opposed to their outlawed group's
July 1997 truce.
	   Police Det. Chief Superintendent Sean Camon offered a detailed
description of the moments when officers confronted the gang on the
main highway south of Dublin.
	   Camon said police moved in immediately after the gang, disguised
as government road workers, stopped the cash-loaded van at gunpoint
and began trying to break it open using sledgehammers and a steel
cutter.
	   Camon said the gang had planned to cut open the roof of the van,
pour in gasoline and threaten to burn alive the two security guards
inside if they didn't surrender the cash.
	   He said police killed Ronan McLoughlin, 28, after he tried to
hijack a passing civilian's car and pointed his loaded .357 Magnum
revolver at police.
	   Stephen Carney, 23, was arrested after pointing his pump-action
shotgun at officers, then crashing one of the gang's getaway
vehicles into two police cars.
	   Philip Forsythe, 25, and Danny McAllister, 43, were found hiding
in nearby hedges. Camon said McAllister had been operating the
cutter, while Forsythe had been wielding a fake rocket launcher.
	   Saoirse Breatnach, 24, was arrested after failing to hijack
another passing car using her Kalashnikov assault rifle, then
losing a fistfight with police.
	   Police arrested the final gang member, 34-year-old Pascal Burke,
about 2 miles (3 kms) away, where he was waiting in a stolen van
containing radio scanners and mobile phones intended to ease the
gang's getaway.
	   Camon said Burke had previously been convicted in 1989 of
possessing explosives and spent five years in prison, while Carney
and McAllister both had five previous convictions related to
terrorism and petty crime.
	   Police presume the gang's intention was to raise funds to buy
arms for the Real IRA faction, which in August committed the worst
atrocity in the three-decade history of the Northern Ireland
conflict _ a car bomb in the town of Omagh that killed 29 civilians
and wounded 370. The Real IRA called an open-ended truce in
September.
	   The IRA has frequently robbed banks and armored cars in the
Irish Republic to fund its operations.

Lukewarm victory poses awkward challenge for Quebec's separatists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos MTL101;103 &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Quebec's separatist premier, Lucien Bouchard,
faced an awkward future Tuesday after voters returned him to power
but made clear there was no groundswell of support for secession.
	   Backed by only 43 percent of the voters, Bouchard's Parti
Quebecois found itself still in control of the legislature, yet
lacking a mandate to press quickly for its paramount goal _
independence from Canada.
	   Instead, Bouchard and his foes agreed, the government will have
to focus on difficult, unglamorous issues like job creation,
deficit reduction and shoring up eroding social services.
	   Bouchard had hoped for a decisive win in Monday's provincial
election as a first step toward calling for a referendum on
secession. He has pledged to hold such a referendum only when
confident the separatists can win, and he admitted Tuesday this is
not now the case.
	   ``It's clear Quebeckers don't want a referendum right now,'' he
told a news conference. ``They want us to complete the reforms that
we've started.
	   ``I personally trust that, provided we succeed in those
achievements, we will create a momentum of confidence-building all
over Quebec, and in such a climate the winning conditions for a
referendum will arise.''
	   After a 33-day campaign billed as a showdown over separatism,
Quebec emerged from the election with its political forces in
almost the same position as after the last election in 1994.
	   The separatists won 75 of the legislature's 125 seats, while the
anti-separatist Quebec Liberal Party won 48, a third party called
Democratic Action won one, and one seat remained unfilled because
of a candidate's recent death.
	   In 1994, the separatists won 77 seats to 47 for the Liberals,
while each side won about 44 percent of the popular vote.
	   On Monday, the Liberals again won 44 percent of the votes, while
the separatists slipped to 43 percent. Democratic Action _ which
favors greater autonomy but not necessarily independence _ won 12
percent behind its 28-year-old leader Mario Dumont.
	   The separatists were able to convert modest vote totals into a
legislative majority because their support _ mostly among the
French-speaking majority _ is spread evenly across much of the
province. Anti-separatist support is concentrated in fewer
districts, mostly in and around multiethnic Montreal.
	   Liberal Party leader Jean Charest said Bouchard was now in a
bind, in danger of alienating mainstream voters if he maneuvers
vigorously for a referendum or alienating Parti Quebecois militants
if he does not.
	   ``One of the groups is going to be deeply disappointed,''
Charest said. ``The members of the Parti Quebecois today have to
feel very uncomfortable about the results.''
	   Charest, who will be opposition leader in the legislature, said
Quebeckers ``want a government that's going to focus on making
Quebec work as a society, that will not divide us.''
	   One of the next battlegrounds for Bouchard will be upcoming
negotiations pitting him and premiers of other provinces against
the federal government. Several other provinces are now echoing
Quebec's longstanding demands for more control over social
spending, and Prime Minister Jean Chretien must decide whether to
cede some federal powers or risk giving Bouchard a new grievance.
	   One of Chretien's Cabinet ministers, Quebec native Stephane
Dion, said threats of secession are not an appropriate way to
extract concessions from the federal government.
	   ``It divides our society, it hurts our economy,'' Dion said.
``It gives to many Canadians outside Quebec the sense that
Quebeckers are small kids and receive too much from the federal
government.''
	   In some anti-separatist newspapers in English-speaking Canada,
the tone toward the Parti Quebecois was even harsher.
	   ``The tedious Quebec situation can, and should be, ignored by
all Canadians,'' wrote columnist Diane Francis in the Toronto-based
National Post. ``Nobody's going anywhere without the full consent
of everyone both inside and outside Quebec.''

Tensions rise over Palestinian prisoners, Jewish settlements
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS Top to LEAD with Palestinian official's comments and
Israeli reaction &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinians stepped up their demands Tuesday
for the release of prisoners jailed for anti-Israel acts, but Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would not budge on the issue.
	   At a rally for prisoner releases in the West Bank city of
Ramallah, Ahmed Qureai, speaker of the Palestinian legislature,
alluded to the six-year Palestinian uprising against Israeli
occupation when he told the crowd, ``the leadership that threw
stones is prepared once again to throw stones in order to free the
people and to free the land.''
	   The comments drew a sharp response from Israel. ``The prime
minister will not tolerate threats of violence,'' read a statement
issued by Netanyahu's office.
	   Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
appealed to U.S. President Bill Clinton to resolve growing tensions
over Israel's refusal to release so-called security prisoners.
	   Netanyahu said he could not release prisoners who had been
involved in attacks on Israelis. ``I will not back down on this,''
he vowed.
	   The issue, which has prompted clashes between stone-throwing
Palestinian youths and Israeli soldiers, is raising concern about
an outbreak of violence in advance of Clinton's Dec. 12-15 visit to
Israel and the Palestinian-ruled lands.
	   The Israeli daily Haaretz reported that Israeli security
officials had urged Netanyahu to agree to free more Palestinian
activists in order to prevent rioting.
	   Palestinians claim that Israel promised at the Wye River summit
last month to free 750 prisoners from political factions such as
Arafat's Fatah group. Israel released 250 prisoners last month, but
most were car thieves and petty crooks.
	   ``This deception is creating demonstrations, anger and
frustration in the Palestinian community,'' Tibi told a Foreign
Press Association news conference.
	   Demonstrations have been held almost daily in support of
Palestinian prisoners, with some of the anger turned on Arafat and
his government.
	   Several hundred demonstrators gathered at rallies in Ramallah
and in the Gaza Strip, where about 150 children called for the
release of their fathers.
	   ``How can we live without our fathers?'' said Fidda Washah, 16,
who addressed the rally. Her father, Jabar, a member of the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine faction, has served 14 years
of a life sentence for attacking Israeli soldiers.
	   Netanyahu said he would not release anyone ``with blood on their
hands'' or members of the Islamic militant group Hamas.
	   ``The Palestinians are claiming, falsely, that I suggested
somehow to free murders at Wye,'' Netanyahu told reporters.
	   Israeli officials say only about 110 of the 2,500 Palestinian
activists behind bars could be let go in the next release,
scheduled to take place just after Clinton's visit.
	   Tibi, who was spokesman for the Palestinian delegation at Wye
Mills, Maryland, said only about 300 of the Palestinians currently
in jail had been involved in attacks that killed Israelis. The rest
he described as ``political prisoners.''
	   He said about 1,250 prisoners who were members of various PLO
factions and the remainder belonged to Hamas.
	   ``We would very much like him (Clinton) to interfere in the
issue of Palestinian prisoners,'' said Tibi.
	   David Bar-Illan, a senior adviser to Netanyahu, said Israel
would not agree to loosen the definition and free Palestinians
involved in attacks that only injured Israelis.
	   ``We will not budge on this one,'' Bar-Illan said, adding Israel
had freed more than 7,000 prisoners over the past five years.
	   Palestinian officials called on residents of the West Bank to
confront Israeli bulldozers that are expanding settlements or
building roads to link Israeli-controlled areas of the West Bank
and Israel.
	   ``Settlement activity should be resisted,'' said Tibi.
``Settlers are public enemy No. 1 to Palestinians.''
	   Several members of the Palestinian legislative council are
considering a boycott of Clinton's speech in Gaza City on Dec. 14
to show their anger over a failure by the United States to pressure
Israel on the settlement and prisoner issues.

Bayern Munich beats Stuttgart 3-0 to reach Cup semifinal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Bundesliga leader Bayern Munich shrugged
off freezing weather and reached the semifinals of the German Cup
by routing crisis-shaken Stuttgart 3-0 on Tuesday.
	   Carsten Jancker used a good pass from veteran Lothar Matthaeus
in the 26th minute to open the scoring.
	   A looping shot from 20 meters (yards) by international
midfielder Mario Basler made it 2-0 and substitute Alexander
Zickler scored the third in the 79th after a fast break.
	   A small crowd of 11,000 braved the freezing temperature to see
the match in the Olympic stadium.
	   The defeat could spell the end of coach Winfried Schaefer's
reign in Stuttgart, which is now without a win in six games, with
four defeats and two losses.
	   Some German media reports say Stuttgart players are rebelling
against the unpopular coach, who is also detested by fans.
	   Schaefer dropped Bulgarian star midfielder Krasimir Balakov from
the rosters, while starting striker Fredi Bobic only came on in the
second halftime.

Norwegians to buy 25 percent of Russia's largest cellular company
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Norway's state telecommunications company Telenor
said Tuesday it would buy a 25 percent stake in Russia's largest
cellular phone provider, VimpelCom, a news report said.
	   VimpelCom was the first Russian company to trade on the New York
Stock Exchange, in 1996.
	   VimpelCom president Dmitry Zimin said the company welcomed the
dlrs 160 million Telenor sale at a time when obtaining loans from
foreign banks has become extremely difficult, the Interfax news
agency reported. Russia's financial crisis has eroded the
credibility of many Russian companies.
	   The deal gives Telenor 25 percent plus one share of VimpelCom
and three of the nine seats on the board of directors. The sale is
to be completed by June 1, 1999, Interfax said.
	   Telenor runs cellular networks in Norway, Germany, Ireland,
Greece, Austria, Hungary, Montenegro, Ukraine and Bangladesh, the
report said.
	   VimpelCom was founded in 1992 by a group of Russian radio and
defense equipment experts with help from a U.S. investment firm.

Lukewarm victory poses awkward challenge for Quebec's separatists

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Quebec's separatist premier, Lucien Bouchard,
faced an awkward future Tuesday after voters returned him to power
but made clear there was no groundswell of support for secession.
	   Backed by only 43 percent of the voters, Bouchard's Parti
Quebecois found itself still in control of the legislature, yet
lacking a mandate to press quickly for its paramount goal _
independence from Canada.
	   Instead, Bouchard and his foes agreed, the government will have
to focus on difficult, unglamorous issues like job creation,
deficit reduction and shoring up eroding social services.
	   Bouchard had hoped for a decisive win in Monday's provincial
election as a first step toward calling for a referendum on
secession. He has pledged to hold such a referendum only when
confident the separatists can win, and he admitted Tuesday this is
not now the case.
	   ``It's clear Quebeckers don't want a referendum right now,'' he
told a news conference. ``They want us to complete the reforms that
we've started.
	   ``I personally trust that, provided we succeed in those
achievements, we will create a momentum of confidence-building all
over Quebec, and in such a climate the winning conditions for a
referendum will arise.''
	   After a 33-day campaign billed as a showdown over separatism,
Quebec emerged from the election with its political forces in
almost the same position as after the last election in 1994.
	   The separatists won 75 of the legislature's 125 seats, while the
anti-separatist Quebec Liberal Party won 48, a third party called
Democratic Action won one, and one seat remained unfilled because
of a candidate's recent death.
	   In 1994, the separatists won 77 seats to 47 for the Liberals,
while each side won about 44 percent of the popular vote.
	   On Monday, the Liberals again won 44 percent of the votes, while
the separatists slipped to 43 percent. Democratic Action _ which
favors greater autonomy but not necessarily independence _ won 12
percent behind its 28-year-old leader Mario Dumont.
	   The separatists were able to convert modest vote totals into a
legislative majority because their support _ mostly among the
French-speaking majority _ is spread evenly across much of the
province. Anti-separatist support is concentrated in fewer
districts, mostly in and around multiethnic Montreal.
	   Liberal Party leader Jean Charest said Bouchard was now in a
bind, in danger of alienating mainstream voters if he maneuvers
vigorously for a referendum or alienating Parti Quebecois militants
if he does not.
	   ``One of the groups is going to be deeply disappointed,''
Charest said. ``The members of the Parti Quebecois today have to
feel very uncomfortable about the results.''
	   Charest, who will be opposition leader in the legislature, said
Quebeckers ``want a government that's going to focus on making
Quebec work as a society, that will not divide us.''
	   One of the next battlegrounds for Bouchard will be upcoming
negotiations pitting him and premiers of other provinces against
the federal government. Several other provinces are now echoing
Quebec's longstanding demands for more control over social
spending, and Prime Minister Jean Chretien must decide whether to
cede some federal powers or risk giving Bouchard a new grievance.
	   One of Chretien's Cabinet ministers, Quebec native Stephane
Dion, said threats of secession are not an appropriate way to
extract concessions from the federal government.
	   ``It divides our society, it hurts our economy,'' Dion said.
``It gives to many Canadians outside Quebec the sense that
Quebeckers are small kids and receive too much from the federal
government.''
	   In some anti-separatist newspapers in English-speaking Canada,
the tone toward the Parti Quebecois was even harsher.
	   ``The tedious Quebec situation can, and should be, ignored by
all Canadians,'' wrote columnist Diane Francis in the Toronto-based
National Post. ``Nobody's going anywhere without the full consent
of everyone both inside and outside Quebec.''

Rights leader jailed on suspicion of harming national security

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Egyptian human rights activist was
ordered jailed Tuesday for 15 days pending a probe into allegations
that he took money from Britain in return for writing a report
about police brutality.
	   Police are investigating Hafez Abu Saada, the secretary general
of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, for ``accepting
donations without prior government consent,'' an EOHR spokesman
said.
	   The police also are working on the premise that Saada published
``false reports that harm national interests and (accepted) money
transfers from foreign countries aimed at acts that harm national
and security interests,'' said the spokesman, Yasser Abdul-Razzak.
	   The charges are punishable by up to 15 years in jail.
	   Prosecutor-general Raga el-Araby, who used his constitutional
authority to order Saada's detention, will put him on trial if the
police find enough evidence within the next 15 days.
	   The EOHR admits accepting in October a dlrs 25,000 donation by
the British Parliament's human rights committee. But it denies the
money influenced its report on the arrest and alleged torture of
scores of Coptic Christians in the southern village of el-Kusheh in
August.
	   On Tuesday, the EOHR's 15-member board decided to return the
money to Britain and to reject in future all foreign donations, as
a demonstration of its neutrality.
	   The donation became controversial after it was reported on Nov.
23 by an Egyptian weekly, Al-Osboa, which called it a payment for
committing treason. Two days later, the prosecutor-general took up
the case.
	   EOHR's report on el-Kusheh says police, while investigating a
murder of two Coptic Christians in the village, rounded up hundreds
of Copts and beat them in a bid to extract false confessions.
	   The report said police feared the culprits were Muslim and were
anxious to pin the blame on Christians to prevent religious strife
in the Christian majority town.
	   During interviews with The Associated Press, many villagers
confirmed they were tortured.
	   The government has denied widespread torture and says only 14
people were detained. The Interior Ministry says foreign-funded
rights groups are maligning Egypt.
	   Al-Osboa, whose editor is believed to have close links with the
Interior Ministry, called the EOHR report a ``flagrant conspiracy
on Egyptian national security.''

Aid accord shows U.S. ambivalence about getting involved in
</HEADLINE>
Colombia &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) _ Convinced of the need to strengthen
an armed forces under siege by the hemisphere's most powerful
insurgency, the United States signed an accord with Colombia on
Tuesday pledging more military support.
	   But the modest agreement _ creating a bilateral working group to
discuss U.S. military aid options _ seemed as much a symbol of
American reluctance as enthusiasm about getting more deeply
involved in Colombia's nearly 4-decade-old conflict.
	   The group will convene twice a year with the aim of making
Colmbia's armed forces more professional, improving human rights
and fighting drug trafficking, officials said.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, in Colombia for a meeting
of regional defense ministers, called the accord an ``important
step'' that could lead to more tangible assistance in the future.
	   Cohen and Rodrigo Lloreda, the Colombian defense minister,
discussed U.S. training and equipment for a 1,000-man army
battalion expected to be established by mid-1999. The unit's sole
function will be to assist police in anti-narcotics operations.
	   U.S. aid to Colombia's security forces is currently about $100
million a year, most of which goes to the Colombian police and is
classified as counter-narcotics. The aid, including training, is
also restricted by U.S. law to military units with clean human
rights records _ a tough prohibition in a country with some of
Latin America's most serious abuses.
	   Even if the United States does not provide direct aid to fight
the insurgency, said Lloreda, its counter-narcotics assistance will
weaken the rebels by attacking one of their main sources of income.
The guerrillas increasingly fund their insurgency by taxing the
drug trade.
	   The top commander of U.S. forces in Latin America, Gen. Charles
E. Wilhelm, said Tuesday that Colombia's military was ``heading in
the right direction'' versus the rebels but still has serious
problems with mobility, intelligence and river operations.
	   Wilhelm said U.S.-trained units can engage with the rebels as
long as they are accompanying police in operations in areas where
the guerrillas are clearly involved in drug trafficking. While
recognizing that the lines can become blurred, officials bristle at
the suggestion that the United States is getting involved in
Colombia's civil conflict.
	   ``I am definitely not referring to counterinsurgency,'' a senior
U.S. official traveling with Cohen said at a press briefing,
responding to a reporter's question about whether any of the aid
will be used against the guerrillas. The official spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   Some observers are worried that U.S. military aid could send
confusing signals to the rebels, undermining President Andres
Pastrana's attempts to coax them toward peace.
	   But such assistance could also help the Colombian army push the
guerrillas nearer to a settlement.

Most of archaeological digs in Israel halted over budget dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: FIXES spelling of archaeology throughout ADDS details 3rd
graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Archaeology, one of Israel's biggest tourist
attractions, suffered a blow Tuesday when most of the country's
excavations were shut down.
	   The Israel Antiquities Authority halted its salvage digs after
the Supreme Court ruled that developers and building contractors
cannot be billed for the costs of these excavations.
	   In the country of Jesus and King Solomon, Crusader King Richard
the Lion Hearted and Saladin, the Arab conqueror who battled the
crusaders in the streets of Jerusalem, it is almost impossible to
start a building or a road without uncovering ancient remains.
	   In the archaeological sense Israel is the one of the most
crowded countries in the world, with some 25,000 known sites
excavated or still waiting to be dug up.
	   Ahead of most construction projects, the Antiquities Authority
carries out a salvage dig. In response to a petition from a
developer, the Supreme Court ruled Sunday that the government, not
the builder, must bear the costs of the salvage digs.
	   In response, the Antiquities Authority decided Tuesday to halt
all salvage digs which account for about 300 of the 350 excavations
carried out in Israel each year.
	   ``We have no budget for salvage digs,'' said Antiquities
Authority spokeswoman Osnat Gouez.
	   Major digs open to the public like those in Jerusalem, Caesarea
and Beit Shean have been drastically curtailed for lack of
government funding, Gouez said.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In an ambulance escorted by armed police in
darkness, former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet left
hospital Tuesday for a luxury home on the edge of Wentworth golf
course to continue his fight against extradition to Spain on
charges of genocide and torture.
	   To shout and taunts of fist-shaking demonstrators, Pinochet
swept through the gates of Grovelands Priory a day after the
psychiatric hospital announced that the 83-year-old general is fit,
does not need medical care, and demanded that he leave.
	   With a police helicopter circling overhead, the ambulance convoy
arrived an hour later at the Wentworth Estate, a compound of
magnificent houses with private grounds, many overlooking the
fairways of the famed course, 20 miles (30 kms) west of London and
home to the European golf tour.
	   There was no word on who owns the house, in the estate's Lindale
Close, where Pinochet is staying. North Surrey police chief Carl
Crathern confirmed that Pinochet ``is now in residence in a house
on Wentworth estate.''
	   Supporters househunted while the Grovelands Priory became
increasingly impatient and eventually precipitated Pinochet's
departure by announcing there is nothing wrong with him.
	   The statement was a blow to any attempt by Pinochet to plead
that he is too ill or frail to stand trial over deaths and torture
of political opponents by secret police during his 1973-90 rule
after he overthrew an elected Marxist.
	   Britain's Home Secretary Jack Straw must decided by Dec. 11
whether to let extradition proceedings start and if he does
Pinochet will likely be in Britain through months of court battles.
Straw could block extradition on several grounds, including
compassion.
	   ``He showed no compassion for us, so why should we show any for
him,'' said Francina Ramirez, 41, a Chilean exile outside the
hospital who said she was arrested by Pinochet's secret police and
tortured with electric currents passing through her breasts.
	   Pinochet's new neighbors, mostly bankers and stockbrokers, face
similar scenes of demonstrations and a heavy police presence.
	   In the House of Commons, Foreign Office Minister Derek Fatchett
warned Britons to stay away from Chile unless it was essential to
go there. He said Britons living there ``to keep a low profile,
avoid crowds, meetings, demonstrations and areas where the
English-speaking community usually gathers.''
	   Chile's government stepped up efforts to get the Pinochet freed.
In Spain, Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said it was becoming
increasingly likely Pinochet would be tried in Chile.
	   Although an official Chilean report says some 3,000 people were
murdered or tortured during Pinochet's rule, the Chilean government
wants him back _ partly because of fears that the anger of his

	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in a central London hospital where
he had undergone back surgery. He moved Oct. 29 to Grovelands
Priory which for more than two weeks has been trying to make him
leave.
	   An National Opinion Poll published Tuesday indicated that 51
percent of Britons think Pinochet should be extradited, 32 percent
disagreed and the rest of the 961-strong sample of voters
questioned had no opinion. The error margin was plus or minus three
percent.

Artillery echoes through hills at Mammoth Mountain

	   MAMMOTH MOUNTAIN, California (AP) _ Howitzers welcomed World Cup
ski racers to this California resort on Tuesday as workers tried to
clear mountain drifts from a 2-foot (0.6-meter) snowfall overnight.
	   The guns could well have been a 21-gun salute for the powerful
Austrian women's team, which swept two downhills and a super-G last
weekend at Lake Louise, Alberta.
	   Austrian women have won four of the six races so far and, with
this resort playing host to a super-G and a slalom this week,
there's every reason to think the ``Power Team'' can add to its
laurels.
	   A year ago, it was the German team that swept all before it and,
even though two-time World Cup overall champion Katja Seizinger is
out with a knee injury, the remaining members aren't quite ready to
hand all the laurels to Austria.
	   ``Mammoth Mountain is a very good slope for me, steep and
difficult,'' said Hilde Gerg, third the last two years in the
overall standings and with a victory, a second, a third and a fifth
from previous visits here
	   Gerg was third in the super-G behind Austrian Alexandra
Meissnitzer and teammates Martina Ertl and Regina Haeusl each had
fourths in the downhills won both days by Renate Goetschl. While
not victories, those placements are giving the Germans hope early
in the season.
	   ``I think we can come more and more and get better,'' Gerg said.
	   ``Last year, I was third in the overall and you think this year
you can perhaps be second or even first, but it's not easy. You
have to look at how the other girls are skiing. Alexandra
Meissnitzer is skiing very well at the moment. But it's a long
season and we will see.''
	   Although the German women have been very good in the 1990s, last
year ``was a dream season for us,'' said Gerg, who added a gold
medal in slalom and a bronze in the combined in the Olympics at
Nagano, Japan.
	   ``What happened happened. The success I've had, nobody can take
it from me. It's mine,'' she said. ``But we also want to continue
to ski well. We want to say it wasn't only one season.
	   ``It's very nice to have it, but now it's not going to be so
easy. But I think it's good to have to fight; it's not so bad if
it's not always so easy.''
	   Gerg admits that some of Germany's early problems can be blamed
on Seizinger's absence.
	   ``Every girl is skiing for herself, but on the team it's not so
easy to tell who is the leader,'' she said. ``With Katja it was
always easy; if she said something, that meant it was right.''

Prominent Islamic writer in Egypt dies at 85
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Aisha Abdul-Rahman, Egypt's leading female
Islamic writer, philosopher and literary critic, died Tuesday in
hospital after a heart attack. She was 85.
	   Abdul-Rahman was admitted to a hospital in Cairo on Saturday
after suffering a stroke, Egypt's Middle East News Agency said.
	   Better known Bent el-Shati, or the daughter of the shore,
Abdul-Rahman was born in 1913 in the northern town of Dumyat,
overlooking a lake near the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
	   Challenging tradition, she received her primary education at
home at a time when women were not encouraged to go to school.
	   She continued her studies and graduated from Cairo University in
1939 with a B.A. in literature and then a Ph.D. in 1950 under
Egypt's greatest writer, Taha Hussein.
	   She spent some 10 years as the head of the Arabic and Islamic
departments at Ain Shams University in Cairo and also taught at
several Arab universities.
	   She wrote more than 40 books on Islamic teachings, dozens of
literary books and novels as well as hundreds of researches and
daily columns in several newspapers.
	   Abdul-Rahamn received several awards for her outstanding career
from the governments of Egypt, Morocco and Kuwait.
	   She was married to Sheik Amin el-Khouli, who was her teacher in
Cairo University during her undergraduate days. He died some years
ago. The couple is survived by a son and a daughter.
	   Funeral arrangements were not immediately known.

Ofili wins prestigious Turner Prize with elephant dung works
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Chris Ofili, notorious for incorporating lumps of
elephant dung in his paintings, on Tuesday was awarded this year's
Turner Prize, the most high-profile award of the contemporary art
year.
	   Ofili, 30, from Manchester, is the first painter to win the
prize for at least 12 years. He mixes hip hop, pornographic and
Biblical references in his multi-layered and detailed work, which
incorporates balls of elephant dung in every painting.
	   If they are not stuck to the canvas, the lacquered, fist-sized
balls support each painting's lower edge as they are propped on the
floor.
	   The Turner Prize, open to British artists under 50 exhibiting
during the previous 12 months, carries a 20,000 pound (dlrs 33,000)
cash award.
	   This year's other short-listed artists were all female _
sculptor Cathy de Monchaux, and video installation artists Tacita
Dean and Sam Taylor-Wood.
	   Although short lists invariably include a painter, the prize has
more often been won by sculptors or conceptual artists, including
Rachel Whiteread's inside-out room (1993), Anish Kapoor's organic
shapes (1991) and Damien Hirst's pickled cows (1995).
	   The previous two years had been triumphs for video artists
Gillian Wearing (``police officers'' posing for 20 minutes, 1997)
and Douglas Gordon (two hands fighting, 1996).

Puerto Rico a site for relocated Panama anti-drug base
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Colombia-US
 &UR; By JARED KOTLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) _ U.S. military counternarcotics
operations currently based in Panama will be relocated to Puerto
Rico and elsewhere in the region when Washington completes its
troop pullout from Panama next year, a senior U.S. commander said
Tuesday.
	   ``In a certain sense you can look at Puerto Rico as a partial
replacement for Panama,'' said Marine Gen. Charles E. Wilhelm,
chief of the U.S. Southern Command with responsibility for Latin
America, during a meeting of regional defense ministers.
	   Negotiations to maintain a U.S. troop presence for
anti-narcotics purposes in Panama were scuttled in September,
setting U.S. officials on a search for alternatives. All U.S.
troops must quit the country by Dec. 31, 1999, when the Panama
canal reverts to Panamanian control.
	   Panama was considered the ideal base for drug interdiction, due
to its central location along shipment routes between Andean
cocaine- and heroin-producing countries and the United States.
Currently, U.S. AWACs radar planes track drug flights through the
region from Howard Air Force Base in Panama. The facility will be
closed in May.
	   ``In terms of geography, Puerto Rico is not where Panama is,''
said Wilhem, who said the change in plans could curtail operations
for a time but would still satisfy U.S. counternarcotics needs ``to
a reasonable extent.''
	   Wilhem did not reveal which other countries might be prepared to
accept a U.S. presence, saying only that they were in the southern
Caribbean, Central America and ``the Andean ridge'' _ which
includes Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru.
	   He said the United States wants to reach agreements allowing
access to existing airfields while avoiding a large U.S. troop
buildup in a region highly sensitive to foreign intervention.

Government warns of action against Kosovo rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The government of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic accused Kosovo rebels Tuesday of endangering the
province's shaky peace, warning it won't tolerate continued attacks
``no matter what the price.''
	   In a statement sent to the Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe, the government blasted international efforts
to include the rebels in the peace process for effectively
``legalizing the terrorists.''
	   ``Insolent, criminal activity and provocative actions by
Albanian terrorists present an obstacle to the peace process ... in
defiance of state bodies and international appeals,'' said the
statement carried by the official Tanjug news agency.
	   The strongly worded statement, issued on the eve of an OSCE
meeting on Kosovo in Oslo, Norway, signaled Milosevic's defiance as
U.S. and other international mediators intensify efforts to
negotiate a solution for Kosovo.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill is due in Belgrade on Wednesday with
a reworked version of his draft plan for Kosovo. Hill has sought
KLA support for the draft.
	   Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, has rejected the
plan because it would loosen its control over the southern
province, whose population is dominated by independence-minded
ethnic Albanians.
	   The government is proposing a form of self-rule that would keep
Kosovo firmly within Serbia.
	   But in the statement Tuesday the Yugoslav government harsly
objected to involving the KLA in the peace process and accused
ethnic Albanian politicians of supporting the rebels.
	   ``Without a resolute condemnation and adequate measures,
separatists and terrorists will continue attacks against the
innocent population, which the state will not allow no matter what
the price,'' said Jovanovic.
	   The government accused the KLA rebels of carrying out 310
attacks since Milosevic and U.S. mediators negotiated an end to
seven months of violence on Oct. 12. The statement said nine
policemen and six civilians had been killed since then.
	   The October deal called for withdrawal of most of Serb-led
forces from Kosovo. An OSCE verifying mission is to observe the
cease-fire.
	   ``The aim of terrorists and separatists is not a political
solution ... but terror, violence and an attempt to change the
borders,'' the government said.
	   It blasted ``contacts that representatives of various countries
and organizations keep with terrorists, killers, kidnappers,
bandits and other criminals that call themselves the KLA.''
	   ``Such actions undermine a true political process and peaceful
solution,'' the government warned.
	   A Serb government crackdown against the KLA earlier this year
claimed hundreds of lives and made some 300,000 people homeless.
There are fears that the province could explode in renewed fighting
next spring if a political solution is not found.

Honduras lowers Mitch death toll to 5,657

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Honduras announced Tuesday that it
suspended a governor for inflating her region's death toll from
Hurricane Mitch, and lowered its official death count by 1,350
people.
	   The new death toll of 5,657 was compiled after the government
sent teams to verify reports from regions across Honduras, the
Interior Secretariat said Tuesday.
	   The governor, Lucila Esperanza Barahona de Castro of the Santa
Barbara region in remote northwestern Honduras, was suspended after
investigators could verify only 282 of the 1,159 deaths reported in
her area.
	   Authorities said the suspension was standard procedure during an
inquiry.
	   Barahona told The Associated Press she couldn't have falsified
the numbers because she didn't even give a death toll to the
federal government.
	   ``I don't know what source gave them the numbers,'' she said
Tuesday.
	   In addition to the 5,657 dead, Honduras said it had verified
8,058 missing, 12,272 injured and 1.4 million homeless throughout
the country.
	   Aid workers and journalists began questioning Honduras'
estimated death toll after figures jumped drastically Nov. 2, two
days after news broke of a landslide in Nicaragua that covered two
villages and killed up to 2,000 people.

Activity subsides at Mexican volcanos
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Villagers returned to their homes on the
slopes of the Colima volcano on Tuesday after a 15-day evacuation
caused by bursts of ash and rivers of lava.
	   About 180 residents of the town of La Yerbabuena in western
Colima state returned, although soldiers planned to stay in the
town to stand guard.
	   ``The danger posed by the volcano has diminished,'' Colima civil
protection official Javier Velasco said. ``People can return to
their daily lifestyles and children can go back to school.''
	   But some experts advised continued caution. Geologist Michael
Sheridan of the University of Buffalo in New York state said the
Colima volcano could be entering a period of activity that he said
comes every 40-50 years.
	   ``Colima is going through its regular cycle, and it's
approaching its climactic phase, which is going to be very
violent,'' he said. ``It could happen this week or it could happen
within a month.''
	   Meanwhile, the Popocatepetl Volcano near Mexico City also showed
signs of diminished activity, the National Center for Disaster
Prevention said.
	   The ``Popo'', as local residents call it, had six brief bursts
Tuesday morning, sending small quantities of ash over nearby towns.
	   Soldiers have increased patrols to keep climbers and hikers at
least 4 1/2 miles (7 kms) away from the Popo's crater.
	   Although no evacuations have been ordered, the Mexico City
government reportedly is setting up more than 100 shelters capable
of housing 53,000 people in the event that they become necessary.

Letter bomb explodes in Canberra
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia, (AP) _ A letter bomb exploded early
Wednesday morning at Canberra's regional mail center in the
industrial suburb of Fyshwick, injuring one postal worker.
	   Police said the man's injuries are not serious, but they have
closed the center, fearing that more devices might be present.
	   The ceiling of the building was damaged
	   The explosion occurred in the early hours of Wednesday, local
time.
	   Police say their inquiries might take a week.
	   ``It was a well-constructed, sophisticated letter bomb,' Police
Sgt. Ron Garbutt told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   ``To me that appears as though the person constructing it knew
what they were doing and was certainly not an amateurish attempt at
making a letter bomb.''
	   The police have no idea who the bomb was addressed to or where
it came from, Garbutt said.

Belle and Orioles finally agree on dlrs 65 million, five-year deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID GINSBURG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ Albert Belle arrived in Baltimore on Tuesday
wielding a pen instead of his potent bat, becoming the highest-paid
player in the history of the Orioles.
	   Belle finally agreed to a dlrs 65 million, five-year contract
Monday night and signed on with the Orioles before being introduced
during a news conference at Camden Yards.
	   Belle said Baltimore was always his favorite team when he was
growing up and Eddie Murray, now a coach for the team, was one of
his heroes.
	   ``I finally get an opportunity to come here,'' he said. ``I'm
looking forward to working with these guys. They definitely want to
go all out to win. This club is definitely a contender.''
	   Orioles general manager Frank Wren called Belle ``one of the
outstanding hitters'' in baseball.
	   Before checking into Baltimore, however, Belle checked out all
his options.
	   Wren settled Friday with Belle's agent, Arn Tellem, on the
financial terms of the deal. But while the sides worked to solidify
other issues, Belle did some probing on his own.
	   According to a source who was in contact with several major
league teams, Belle personally placed telephone calls Monday to
Yankees general manager Brian Cashman and Chicago White Sox general
manager Ron Schueler, asking if they were interested in him.
	   New York withdrew its offer last week after Bernie Williams
re-signed for dlrs 87.5 million over seven years.
	   Belle had until Wednesday to return to the White Sox and
complete a dlrs 55 million, five-year deal that guaranteed him dlrs
35 million in the next three seasons, but Chicago refused to
increase Belle's salary.
	   So Belle chose the Orioles, who were lagging behind the other AL
contenders in the free-agent sweepstakes and felt compelled to
overlook Belle's checkered past by offering him one of the most
lucrative contracts in U.S. baseball history.
	   The contract ties Belle with Mike Piazza of the New York Mets
for the third-highest average salary (dlrs 13 million) behind only
Anaheim's Mo Vaughn (dlrs 13.33 million) and Arizona's Randy
Johnson (dlrs 13.1 million).
	   It took until Monday for an agreement on the final detail, the
extent of the no-trade clause in the contract.
	   Belle's deal is the sixth highest in total dollars, trailing
only Piazza (dlrs 91 million), Williams, Vaughn (dlrs 80 million),
Boston's Pedro Martinez (dlrs 75 million) and the Los Angeles
Dodgers' Gary Sheffield (dlrs 68.5 million).
	   Belle became available because his contract with the White Sox
included a clause that allowed him to ask for a raise or become a
free agent if his average salary didn't remain among the top three
in baseball. Belle was knocked out of the top three when Sheffield
received an additional dlrs 7.5 million for agreeing to waive his
no-trade clause and go from Florida to the Los Angeles Dodgers last
spring.
	   Belle hit .328 this year with 49 homers and 152 RBIs. He led the
AL in slugging percentage (.655) and total bases (399), and set
club records for homers, doubles (48), total bases and extra-base
hits (99). He was second in the AL in doubles, homers and RBIs.

Cleveland opera singer kills self after bad outing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details, quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By AMY BETH GRAVES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ An opera singer who was said to be distraught
over a bad rehearsal hanged himself in a hospital psychiatric ward.
	   Edward Russell White, a 6-foot-6 (1.98 meter) bass-baritone, was
found Sunday hanging by a bedsheet tied to a cast-iron sewer pipe
at the Cleveland Clinic.
	   He had been taken to the clinic from his hotel room, where on
Friday night he had taken 80 pills of a medication to treat
seizures or panic attacks, police Sgt. Mark Hastings said.
	   Opera officials said White, 46, was upset following a Friday
rehearsal for the Cleveland Opera's upcoming production of ``Lucia
di Lammermoor.''
	   ``There is pressure in show business, but nobody asked him to do
the impossible,'' said David Bamberger, general director of the
opera. ``He apparently had very deeply seated insecurities.''
	   Ambulance workers who took White to the hospital on Saturday
said he told them he wanted to die. A doctor diagnosed White as
severely depressed.
	   In his room, White had stuffed his bed with blankets to make it
appear he was in it, hospital officials said. He was found
unconscious and taken to the emergency room, where he died.
	   White was from East Orange, New Jersey and used the stage name
Edward Russell in recent years. He appeared in opera productions in
the United States and in Europe, including a performance of
Rimsky-Korsakov's ballet-opera ``Mlada'' with the London Symphony
Orchestra in 1988. He made his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1990 as
the undertaker in ``Porgy and Bess.''
	   He performed several times with the Cleveland Opera in
productions such as ``Fidelio'' in 1991, ``Rigoletto'' in 1996 and
``The Flying Dutchman'' last year.
	   White arrived last week in Cleveland to replace a singer who
became ill, but had plenty of time to rehearse and was upbeat about
the role, Bamberger said.
	   Bamberger also saw White after the drug overdose.
	   ``He said he was hoping to be out of the hospital in time to do
the show,'' he said. ``This is such a shock. He was ... a most fun
and pleasant person. I guess there was a level of pain that we
didn't see.''

Most of archaeological digs in Israel halted over budget dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: FIXES spelling of archaeology throughout ADDS details 3rd
graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Archaeology, one of Israel's biggest tourist
attractions, suffered a blow Tuesday when most of its excavations
were shut down.
	   The Israel Antiquities Authority halted its salvage digs _
carried out ahead of most construction projects _ after the Supreme
Court ruled that developers and builders cannot be billed for these
excavations.
	   In the country of Jesus and King Solomon, Richard the Lion
Hearted and Saladin, the Arab conqueror who battled the crusaders
in the streets of Jerusalem, it is almost impossible to start a
building or a road without uncovering ancient remains.
	   In response to a petition from a developer, however, the Supreme
Court ruled Sunday that the government, not the builder, must bear
the costs of the salvage digs, operated by the Antiquities
Authority.
	   In response, the Antiquities Authority decided Tuesday to halt
all salvage digs which account for about 300 of the 350 excavations
carried out in Israel each year.
	   ``We have no budget for salvage digs,'' said Antiquities
Authority spokeswoman Osnat Gouez.
	   Major digs open to the public like those in Jerusalem, Caesarea
and Beit Shean have been drastically curtailed for lack of
government funding, Gouez said.
	   In the archaeological sense, Israel is the one of the most
crowded countries in the world, with some 25,000 known sites
excavated or waiting to be dug up.

Report: Asia on way to recovery and presenting big opportunities
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia, (AP) _ Most troubled Asian economies will
recover in two to five years and will provide ``significant
commercial opportunities, a new Australian government report
released Wednesday said.
	   ``Asia's infrastructure needs are still enormous,'' said the
report, called Asia's infrastructure in the Crisis, Harnessing
Private Enterprise.
	   The report, launched by Trade Minister Tim Fischer, is the work
of a team
	   headed by Dr. Frances Perkins, executive director of the East
Asia analytical unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and
Trade.
	   It concludes that troubled regional economies will bottom out in
1999 and 2000, and it looks at how Asian countries will finance
their power, water and transport requirements after that time.
	   ``Regional governments had insufficient resources to meet these
needs even before the crisis, but now have even fewer,'' the report
says.
	   ``Most are devoting huge amounts to bail out their financial
systems and assist the unemployed,'' it adds.
	   ``These governments are therefore keen to harness private sector
funds and expertise to provide much of the infrastructure
shortfall.''
	   The report notes that, before the onset of the crisis last year,
Asia's infrastructure needs were expected to top US dlrs .1.5
trillion over the coming decade.
	   ``That forecast has now been cut back to US dlrs 1 to 1.2
trillion,'' it added.
	   The authors admit that the private sector developers will face
big problems, but insist that they can be overcome.
	   They say the considerable risks involved can be reduced by
finding the best forms of finance and seeking involvement of
agencies like the World Bank.
	   ``Long term concessions are the best practice in private water
supply,'' the report says.
	   ``They leave governments owning the monopoly water pipe and
sewerage network, but give private operators 20 to 30 year leases
to use these assets and collect revenue from water sales.
	   ``East and West Manila and Macau are good examples of private
water concessions in the Asia Pacific,'' the authors say.
	   The report adds that best practices, like these, can provide
benefits to everyone.
	   ``Manila's 1997 tendering process was highly competitive,'' they
say.
	   ``And the tariffs of the winning concessionaires were half to a
quarter of those previously charged by the government owned water
utility.''
	   The report also speaks favorably of what it called ``build,
operate and transfer,'' or BOT, arrangements in many other areas.
	   ``To overcome gaps in regulatory and legal environments, several
East Asian economies, like the Philippines and China, have
introduced successful build, operate, transfer (BOT) legislation to
encourage private investment in
	   infrastructure,'' the report says.
	   However it warns that some regional governments, which it did
not name, still lack the capacity to operate such legislation
efficiently and transparently.
	   The report says tariff reform is is fundamental to preventing
waste and encouraging private infrastructure investment in Asia.
	   ``Singapore leads Asia in electronic tolls and time of day road
pricing,'' the report said.
	   But it says charging practices are often less than optimal.
	   ``In several regional economies, uneconomically low tariffs
mainly benefit middle and high income users,'' it warns.
	   The report says this reduces the authorities' ability to
maintain existing assets and extend their services to lower income
urban and rural areas.

Tyson offers no contest plea on assault charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROCKVILLE, Maryland (AP) _ Mike Tyson pleaded no contest on
Tuesday to charges he assaulted two men following a traffic
accident.
	   Although the plea is not an admission of guilt, Tyson faces up
to 20 years in prison _ 10 years on each count _ when he is
sentenced early next year.
	   ``He admits to losing his temper on the side of the road,''
Tyson attorney Paul Kemp said.
	   Tyson told Judge Steven Johnson he was not promised leniency and
does not expect preferential treatment in sentencing. He also said
he was aware his plea could affect his probation for a 1992 rape
conviction in Indiana.
	   ``The state was prepared to present the facts in the case,''
said Assistant State's Attorney Carol Crawford, objecting to
Johnson acceptance of the plea.
	   The charges stem from an Aug. 31 accident involving his wife,
Monica, in Montgomery County, in suburban Washington, D.C.
	   Abmielec Saucedo and Richard Hardick said Tyson kicked and
punched them following the accident. They have reached an
out-of-court settlement with Tyson to avoid a civil suit in the
case.
	   ``The complainants will testify at sentencing that this is the
appropriate plea,'' Kemp said.
	   Outside court, Tyson would not discuss the incident, although he
did talk about a Jan. 16 bout against Francois Botha. The Nevada
Athletic Commission returned Tyson's boxing license in October. It
was revoked after he bit champion Evander Holyfield's ears during a
June 1997 title bout.

Three Albanians killed in apparent robbery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Three unidentified Albanian laborers were
shot and killed during an apparent robbery in a village in central
Greece, police said Tuesday.
	   According to police, the three men were killed inside their home
in the farming community of Molos. Their bodies were discovered
Tuesday by a villager who went to hire one of the men for a day job
on his farm. The house was ransacked and no money was found.
	   Nearly 500,000 illegal immigrants work and live in Greece, most
of them from Albania. Many Albanians work either as farm hands or
at constructions sites around the country.

Bowe, awaiting sentencing, has assault charge set aside
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Adds last graf on no date for sentencing &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH WHITE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UPPER MARLBORO, Maryland (AP) _ Former heavyweight champion
Riddick Bowe, who is awaiting a probable jail sentence in North
Carolina for kidnapping his estranged wife and five children in
June, has had an earlier assault charge involving his wife set
aside.
	   Judge Hovey Johnson on Monday shelved the second-degree assault
charge from August 1997 on the conditions that Bowe have no violent
conduct with his wife and that he complete a 10-day psychiatric
evaluation and any accompanying treatments.
	   The state withheld the right to return the case to the active
docket any time within the next 12 months.
	   Other than a brief acknowledgment that he understood the
agreement, Bowe said nothing during his court appearance and
refused comment as he left the courtroom. His wife, Judy, who
watched the proceeding from the gallery, also declined comment, as
did Bowe's lawyer, Billy Martin.
	   In June, Bowe pleaded guilty to abducting his wife and children
from their home in Cornelius, North Caorlina. He attempted to drive
them to his home in Fort Washington, Maryland but Mrs. Bowe managed
to phone for help during a stop in Virginia.
	   Prosecutors said Bowe would serve 18 to 24 months in prison
under his plea agreement in the kidnapping case, but he has yet to
be sentenced. He was allowed to return to Maryland on the condition
he remain under house arrest with electronic monitoring.
	   A sentencing date has not been scheduled for Bowe in the North
Carolina case, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's office in
Charlotte said Tuesday.

Chileans debate whether conditions exist at home to try Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Britain-Pinochet &QL; 
 &UR; By EDUARDO GALLARDO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ As a decision nears on whether Gen.
Augusto Pinochet will return to Chile or face extradition to Spain,
controversy is brewing here on whether the former dictator could
receive an effective trial at home.
	   Pinochet, who was arrested on Oct. 16 while visiting London,
faces charges in Spain of genocide, terrorism and torture against
Spanish nationals who lived in Chile during his brutal regime from
1973-90.
	   The Chilean government has opposed his extradition, insisting
instead that the 83-year-old Pinochet can receive an impartial
trial in Chile.
	   Human rights activists and leftist politicians disagree.
	   They argue the biggest hurdles to a Chilean trial are Pinochet's
immunity as a senator for life and an amnesty law issued by his
government.
	   Because of his military status, they say, a case against him
would probably wind up in the armed forces' courts, where his
influence remains considerable.
	   However, the Chilean government says Pinochet's crimes _
including the murder or disappearance of an estimated 3,197 people
_ occurred on its soil and therefore should be handled by Chile's
own courts.
	   Pinochet, who was discharged Tuesday from a London psychiatric
hospital, remains under police custody. Britain's Home Secretary
Jack Straw must decide by Dec. 11 whether to allow the him to
return to his homeland, or authorize his extradition to Spain.
	   The Chilean government, meanwhile, continued to press its case
that a Pinochet trial on its own soil is possible.
	   Justice Minister Soledad Alvear said Tuesday that ``we have an
independent judicial system capable of dealing'' with human rights
trials.
	   She pointed out that the top commanders of Pinochet's feared
secret police _ Gen. Manuel Contreras and Brig. Pedro Espinoza _
are now serving prison terms in Chile for the 1976 assassination of
former Chilean foreign minister Orlando Letelier in Washington.
	   The minister said Pinochet's legislative immunity can be lifted
if formal charges are filed against him.
	   Senate President Andres Zaldivar agreed, saying ``no one in
Chile is above the law.''
	   Chief Justice Roberto Davila said ``nobody should have doubts''
of his country's ability to put him on trial, calling a trial of
Pinochet by a foreign court ``tantamount to trampling Chile's
sovereignty.''
	   However, three socialist congressmen disagreed.
	   The legislators asserted in a letter sent to Secretary Straw
that ``no real conditions exist in Chile to try Pinochet.''
	   Allowing Pinochet to return ``would guarantee him total
impunity,'' said the lawmakers _ Juan Bustos, Fanny Pollarolo and
Juan Pablo Letelier.
	   Nine congressmen in President Eduardo Frei's Christian
Democratic Party said they would only support Pinochet's return if
they are assured his trial would be handled by civilian courts.
	   And, they insisted, the civilian judges should be guaranteed
ample collaboration by the military, including permission to
question officers and inspect barracks if necessary.
	   But Juan Guzman, the civilian judge handling those suits, has
admitted he may have to eventually transfer them to a military
court.
	   In Chile, Pinochet faces 14 lawsuits filed by victims of his
regime's repression, their relatives, and by organizations
representing journalists, nurses and school teachers who were
killed.
	   Jose Miguel Insulza, Chile's foreign minister, said on Tuesday
in Madrid that his government ``is studying whether to join
existing suits.''

Udinese downs Parma 3-2 in first-leg game of quarterfinals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UDINE, Italy (AP) _ Argentine defender Mauro Esteban Navas
scored the game winner in second-half injury time as Udinese downed
Parma 3-2 in a first-leg game of the Italian Cup quarterfinals
Tuesday night.
	   The powerful long-distance drive by Navas in the 92nd could not
be stopped by Hernan Crespo, Parma's Argentine striker who played
the final minutes as keeper to substitute for injured goalie Matteo
Guardalben.
	   Crespo had tallied Parma's 2-2 equalizer in the 76th minute
before being forced between his team posts.
	   Guardalben could not be replaced by another keeper when he was
injured in the 85th as Parma had already completed the allowed
substitutions.
	   It was an unexpected loss for the Parma team which came from a
4-0 rout of AC Milan in a league match last Sunday. The home
triumph vaulted Parma to second place in the Serie A standings.
	   Ghanian teenage star Stephan Appiah put Udinese in front with a
right drive from 8 meters in the 39th minute at the Friuli stadium.
	   Argentine veteran striker Abel Balbo needed only two minutes to
tie the score in the 41st, on a perfect pass by teammate Diego
Fuser.
	   Brazilian striker Amoruso, who has tallied 8 goals in 11 league
matches, gave Udinese a 2-1 lead in the 46th with a precise
diagonal shot.
	   Amoruso was warmly applauded by the partisan crowd as he left
the field, with a light chest bruise, in the 65th.
	   Crespo, rested for most of the game, made it 2-2 minutes after
entering the field and shortly before the unhappy end as a keeper.
	   The first-leg program of the Italian Cup continues Wednesday
with second-division Atalanta hosting Serie A leader Fiorentina.
	   In a clash between soccer powerhouses Lazio takes on
Internazionale of Milan at Rome's Olympic stadium Thursday.
	   Juventus plays Bologna on Jan. 13, in a match postponed for the
Champions Cup commitments of the Turin team at Istanbul Wednesday.
	   Second-leg games are scheduled on Jan. 26.

No-smoking ban stamped out for fights

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ What's Saturday night at the
fights without a cigar?
	   The operators of the Atlantic City Convention Center, a
no-smoking building, will not enforce the ban when the building
holds its first boxing match this weekend.
	   The exemption will apply only to sports events at the dlrs 268
million center, which opened in mid-1997. Conventioneers and others
who rent the building or attend events there won't be allowed to
light up, according to Gregg Caren, assistant general manager.
	   ``When it comes to sporting events, smoking is permitted,'' he
said. ``If it was a meeting or a conference, we'd operate it as (a
no-smoking building). But at a boxing match, anyone knows going in
that they're expecting smoke.''
	   The center is operated by the Atlantic City Convention and
Visitors Authority, just as Convention Hall is. Convention Hall,
the site of most major fights in Atlantic City, is a no-smoking
building as well, but the ban is not enforced at sports events.
	   Promoter Don King, who is promoting the WBA world bantamweight
championship fight between Nana Konadu and Johnny Tapia, said the
issue never came up during negotiations for the fight, which is
expected to attract up to 6,000 people.
	   It's healthier to skip the cigars, anyway, King said Tuesday.
	   ``Do like I do,'' he said. ``Use 'em for a prop. Put 'em in your
mouth and don't light 'em, like I do.''

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Activists across the globe
marched in the streets, distributed condoms and held benefit
concerts Tuesday to try to halt the spread of AIDS, which will kill
millions of people this year alone.
	   Underscoring events on World AIDS Day was this sobering fact:
Although powerful new medicines are helping industrialized
countries win the battle against the disease, it has reached
epidemic proportions in continents where people can't afford the
drugs.
	   About 33.4 million people around the world are infected with
HIV, two-thirds of them in sub-Saharan Africa. In Asia and the
Pacific, 700,000 people become infected with HIV per year.
	   In sub-Saharan Africa, the 1998 death toll from AIDS is expected
to be 2 million. Nearly 6 million more people will become infected
this year _ 1.7 million of them in sub-Saharan Africa.
	   ``In the case of HIV/AIDS, the difference in wealth becomes
literally matter of life and death,'' decried Mary Robinson, the
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.
	   From bars in Hong Kong to parks in South Africa, activists
preached safe sex. People pinned red ribbons on lapels to express
solidarity in the fight against AIDS. In San Juan, Puerto Rico,
more than 3,000 people formed a human red ribbon.
	   ``It's important to be here, to urge people to say `No' to AIDS
and to protect themselves,'' said Carlos Baerga, a free agent
baseball player most recently with the New York Mets. Those whose
loved ones died from AIDS planned to toss carnations into the
Atlantic Ocean in their memory.
	   _ In India, where up to 5 million people are HIV positive,
hundreds of schoolchildren marched beside prostitutes in New Delhi
to draw attention to the epidemic.
	   _Israelis and Palestinians handed out condoms and literature to
passengers departing Israel's international airport in Tel Aviv.
	   _ In Ivory Coast, thousands of children wearing T-shirts with
anti-AIDS slogans and bouncing inflated condoms like beach balls
marched through the streets of Abidjan.
	   _ In Kenya, children wearing black T-Shirts that said ``Stop
AIDS'' distributed condoms and pamphlets on AIDS prevention in
Dandora, an eastern Nairobi slum.
	   _ In Hong Kong's nightspots, activists handed out coasters with
pictures of a condom on one side and a safe-sex message on the
other.
	   _ In Tokyo, Japan's Health Ministry held rallies and concerts in
a central square.
	   _ In Moscow, a contraceptive company's employees sheathed in
red, yellow or green ``condom suits'' handed out condoms in Pushkin
Square.
	   _ In Pretoria, South Africa, clowns painted red AIDS ribbons on
people's faces as drum majorettes entertained a crowd.
	   Underneath it all was a life-and-death message: Practice safe
sex of face the consequences.
	   ``Come and witness the reality of AIDS. See the devastation in
our community. See the fresh graves,'' South African President
Nelson Mandela told hundreds of people in a village in
KwaZulu-Natal province, where an estimated 25 percent of adults are
infected with HIV.
	   But considering the enormity of the problem, the call to action
worldwide was muted.
	   In some countries like Zimbabwe, where an estimated 23 percent
of the population is infected with HIV, World AIDS day passed with
little fanfare. Countries in southern Africa have been slow to
recognize the unfolding tragedy and have little resources to fight
it.
	   It was only in October that the South African government
launched an AIDS awareness program. Already, more than 3 million
South Africans are infected. This year an estimated 168,000 have
died from AIDS.
	   The vast majority of those infected in Africa and other
developing regions cannot afford the drugs that are prolonging life
among AIDS patients in the West.
	   In Washington, President Bill Clinton announced dlrs 10 million
in emergency grants to help children orphaned by AIDS in poorer
nations. Much more assistance would be needed to help turn the
tide.
	   Actress Sharon Stone, speaking at the United Nations in New
York, urged parents to accept that they cannot control their
children's urge to have sex _ and to provide them with condoms so
they don't join the 7,000 young people who are infected every day
with HIV.
	   Stone, who campaigns for the American Foundation for AIDS
Research, spoke at a U.N. discussion on AIDS and youth.
	   ``If you truly, truly love your children, you need to supply
condoms in a place in your home, at a quantity that makes it a
non-judgmental situation for them to have them,'' she said.

Big three absent from Dubai Sevens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Title-holders New Zealand
face a tough challenge from Fiji and Australia in the Dubai
International Rugby Sevens tournament which kicks off here
Thursday.
	   The New Zealanders, who hold the Commonwealth Games gold medal,
will be playing without their skipper and sevens specialist, Eric
Rush, who suffered a calf injury at the last minute.
	   ``Rush's absence is a big blow for us,'' admitted New Zealand
coach Gordon Tietjens. ``But we have been training hard and this is
the best available sevens team.''
	   Dallas Seymour, one of the most durable sevens players in the
world, will be leading New Zealand, who defeated Fiji in the final
here last year.
	   Australia's David Campese and Fiji's Waisale Serevi will also be
absent from the dlrs 50,000 tournament.
	   Campese recently announced his retirement from international
rugby and Serevi, who has led Fiji for the last nine years, could
not obtain leave from his French club to play here.
	   Fiji, with the explosive Marika Vunibaka as their captain, start
as co-favorites to win the 16-nation tournament and the dlrs 25,000
first prize.
	   Australia, led by Jim Williams, will also offer a strong bid for
the title.
	   England is led by former international Rory Underwood. France
has sent a team to Dubai for the first time.
	   Other teams come from Scotland, the United States, Canada,
Zimbabwe, Morocco and Taiwan.
	   The finals are scheduled for Friday.

Foster: U.S. track has big hurdle to clear
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Track Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Greg Foster, one of the newest members of the
U.S. Track and Field Hall of Fame, is now on the other side of his
sport _ and he isn't happy with its status.
	   Foster, a sports agent, is depressed about the decline of
athletics in the United States.
	   ``When we're losing meets annually, it's not good,'' the
hurdling great said Tuesday. ``I tell kids nowadays how good track
and field was when I was coming out of college (UCLA). At that
time, we had about 12 meets indoors and 12 outdoors _ all in this
country.''
	   Foster was the 1984 Olympic silver medalist in the 110-meter
hurdles and the 1983, 1987 and 1991 world champion. He was
world-ranked for 15 of the 16 years from 1977-92.
	   He laments that today's athletes have few opportunities to
compete in this country. Instead, they are forced to go to Europe,
where meets and money are plentiful.
	   ``Not being able to compete in front of the U.S. fans hurts
them,'' he said. ``They can't showcase their talents.
	   ``The sport has changed drastically. For those who are saying it
hasn't, they're not paying attention.
	   ``It's not at rock bottom. They'll always be someone there to
prevent it from hitting rock bottom. There are those of us who love
the sport too much to let that happen. It's a slow decline. But
there's a big difference from what I experienced and what I'm
experiencing now.''
	   When Foster was in his prime, and there were no shortage of
meets, he often competed against Renaldo Nehemiah, the former world
record-holder. While Nehemiah, who was elected into the Hall of
Fame last year, had the best of their confrontations, the
head-to-head meetings were compelling.
	   Those kinds of rivalries brought out crowds and made for the
best competition. Now interest in athletics in the United States
has never been lower.
	   Foster points to other factors in the decline: lack of closeness
between athletes and fans, uncooperative athletes, shortage of
sponsors.
	   Foster recalls that when he competed, athletes would mingle with
spectators afterward _ signing autographs, posing for pictures and
simply talking, heightening the camaraderie. Before meets, he
enjoyed going to the host city and helping the promoter at clinics
and other events.
	   ``Until the athletes realize how important the sponsors are and
give back to the sponsors, the sport will suffer,'' he said.
	   ``They have to learn to make the sport fan-friendly. It's wasn't
so much me publicizing the meet as the meet publicizing me. I've
run in Times Square, I've run at Magic Mountain, I've run at
Madison Square Garden ...''
	   The sport's downfall, he said, has resulted in a lack of quality
athletes.
	   That has forced some athletes, other than sprinters, to run on
relay teams in international meets and college dual meets. A prime
example was Allen Johnson, the two-time world champion and 1996
Olympic gold medalist in the 110 hurdles, who was drafted for the
winning U.S. 1,600-meter relay team at the 1997 World Championships
	   Still, Foster thinks the United States, which has dominated
Olympic track, will remain the world's No. 1 track power.
	   ``But the gap is closing,'' he said. ``The fact that we didn't
win the 4 x 100 relay (at the Atlanta Games) shows that it's
closing. We didn't lose (before) unless we dropped the baton.''
	   He says the sport's future lies with the athletes.
	   ``The athletes have to learn to make the sport exciting,'' he
said. ``Just to show up and run is not enough.''
	   Foster will be inducted into the Hall of Fame on Thursday at a
luncheon, sponsored by Xerox, at USA Track and Field's convention
in Orlando, Florida.
	   Joining him in the Hall will be discus thrower Jay Silvester,
women's distance runner Francie Larrieu-Smith and high jumper
Dwight Stone. The four inductees will bring the Hall's membership
to 176.

Study: Shopping hazardous to men's health
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Men who detest Christmas shopping have a new
excuse to avoid the chore _ it's hazardous to the their health.
	   Male stress levels skyrocket when they're confronted with facing
crowded stores, choosing gifts and standing in check-out lines, a
new British study shows.
	   ``The peak stress levels were equivalent to emergency situations
experienced by fighter pilots or policemen going into dangerous
situations,'' said psychologist David Lewis, who did the research.
	   The study, commissioned by the Brent Cross Shopping Center in
north London, sent about three dozen men and women of different
ages to stores with identical Christmas lists. Some went alone
while others were accompanied by children.
	   An accompanying researcher recorded periodic blood pressure and
heart rate figures during the trips.
	   Every man in the survey suffered considerable increases in blood
pressure and heart rates while only one in four women registered a
significant change.
	   ``For men, even the thought of going shopping was enough to send
stress levels soaring,'' Lewis said. ``Over 70 percent of them
recorded above-average readings before even stepping out the front
door.''
	   Most men surveyed admitted that the stress of Christmas shopping
would make them choose the first gift they see rather than spend
time in crowded stores considering the options.
	   The type of store can have an effect on men, too. Retailers
playing loud music in a crowded atmosphere sent blood pressures
soaring in two-thirds of the men.
	   ``Almost all the women who went shopping with their partners
regretted the decision and, surprisingly, stress levels were
considerably lower for those who shopped with children than those
who took boyfriends or husbands,'' Lewis said.
	   ``The fact is that women cope better with shopping than men,
probably because they have more experience of it,'' he said. ``If
women don't want to let their men get off scot-free they should
draw up a list of Christmas chores and get men to do something at
home while they do the shopping.''

Sharon Stone asks parents to provide condoms to their kids
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-World-Aids Day

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ On World AIDS Day, actress Sharon Stone
urged parents to accept that they cannot stop their children from
having sex _ and to provide them with condoms so they don't become
one of the 7,000 young people infected with HIV every day.
	   ``No matter how much we guide our children within our families,
within our churches, within our schools, we are not stronger than
the power of sexuality _ particularly to a teenager,'' she told a
panel discussion on AIDS and youth Tuesday at the United Nations.
	   For the past three years, Stone has been chairman of the
American Foundation for AIDS Research's campaign for AIDS research.
She arrived 40 minutes late for the panel discussion focusing on
youth and AIDS _with a good excuse.
	   ``I was at a very good party last night. I was at a party where
we raised nearly dlrs 2 million for AIDS research,'' she said, as
the audience burst into applause.
	   Stone, 40, who became a star after her steamy role in ``Basic
Instinct,'' recalled how she never told her parents she was having
sex in the back seat of a car as a teenager.
	   ``I do not encourage teenagers to have sex because it is painful
and difficult enough just to be a teenager,'' she said. ``But I can
tell you that no matter how much someone encouraged me, I lost my
virginity while still a teenager, and I would guess that most of
you did too.''
	   Stone urged parents to tell their children about sex and she
encouraged teenagers to talk to each other about sexuality _ and
about the danger of AIDS. She cited the latest statistics: 5.8
million new HIV infections in 1998 including 3 million young people
aged 10 to 24.
	   Stone urged parents to accept the power of sex ``by allowing a
safe nonjudgmental way for children to protect themselves.''
	   ``I believe that if you truly, truly love your children, you
need to supply condoms in a place in your home, at a quantity that
makes it a nonjudgmental situation for them to have them. I mean
put 200 condoms in a box in some place in the house where everybody
isn't all the time so that your kids can take them,'' she said.
	   ``If they want to make water balloons out of them, great. If
they want to carry them so they feel tough, great. If they want to
give them to their friends, even better,'' she said.
	   Stone said adults have a responsibility to ensure that young
people have protection.
	   ``A lot of people say I can't give this teenager condoms, their
parents are going to lose their minds with me. I don't care. I will
lose my friends before I will let their children die _ and that is
the choice you are looking at,'' she said.
	   Deputy Secretary-General Louise Frechette noted that 95 percent
of all infections and deaths are in the developing world and about
half the new HIV infections now occur in people aged 15-24.
	   ``There is a vaccine for AIDS,'' said Candido Gonzalez, a senior
member of the New York Citizens AIDS Network. ``It is called
education.''
	   Gonzalez fought back tears as he described how he watched his
mother, two cousins, an uncle and more than 60 friends die of AIDS.
	   ``I plead for world leaders to come together to put an end to
this pandemic,'' said Gonzalez, who has lived with AIDS himself for
the last 16 years.

English newspapers hammer England on Ashes loss
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS spelling of Ian Chappell in grafs 10-11 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Newspapers lashed out Tuesday after yet another
humiliation for England's cricket team.
	   ``Day England lost all credibility,'' said a blaring headline in
The Express.
	   ``That's the worst I have seen in 83 test matches,'' said The
Mirror, quoting England captain Alec Stewart.
	   ``One of our worst ever performances,'' echoed The Sun.
	   England's seven-wicket hammering by Australia Monday in the
second Test of the Ashes series _ England was bowled out for 112 in
39 overs on the opening day _ again reminded the nation how far it
has slipped in a game it invented.
	   To make matters worse, on the same day England was battered,
upstart Zimbabwe _ the lowest ranked of the nine Test-playing sides
_ picked up its first overseas Test win when it beat Pakistan by
seven wickets.
	   Writing under a headline calling England ``second-raters on
cricket's world stage,'' The Express columnist James Lawton said
the loss reflected deeper problems.
	   ``It is not just the specter of another defeat which makes
someone who cares for England's cricket legacy feel here like a man
walking down Park Lane with holes in his shoes,'' he said.
	   ``The grimness of this conclusion is that it may be that our
cricket future is drifting beyond our own hands,'' he added.
	   He was referring to a suggestion from former Australia captain
Ian Chappell that England may no longer rate five-Test status
against Australia.
	   ``I just don't know how we can keep handing out the five Tests
to England when teams like Pakistan and South Africa are beginning
to mean a lot more to the young people here,'' he quoted Chappell
as saying.
	   England has won just four of the last 30 Ashes matches to
Australia's 18, and the defeat inside three days means Australia
needs to win only one of the next three Tests to retain the Ashes.
	   The Daily Mail said even the Australian reserves were good
enough to beat England.
	   ``Australia's second 11 could probably beat the tourists as
well,'' wrote columnist Bob Willis.

Cuba declares Christmas a permanent holiday

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Christmas is back on Cuba's official calendar,
after nearly three decades in which political and economic concerns
made Dec. 25 just another day. Cubans said they look forward to the
chance to play, pray or just relax on the upcoming holiday.
	   The Communist Party used the entire front page of Cuba's only
daily newspaper, Granma, to recommend Tuesday that ``from this year
on'' Dec. 25 be a permanent holiday in Cuba. Adoption by the
Communist government is assured.
	   Ordinary Cubans _ whether religious or not _ welcomed the news,
which re-establishes a custom the communist government abolished in
1969.
	   ``It makes me very happy,'' said Marta Soler, a secretary who
came to the Our Lady of Carmen Roman Catholic church to buy
nativity figurines.
	   ``It's another day to rest. ... You can share it with the
family,'' said Judith Arango Rodriguez, 26.
	   Cuba's Roman Catholic Church issued a statement declaring that
it ``highly values this gesture'' and expressing confidence that
``the path of opening of Cuba'' would lead to ``causes for joy,
unity and hope for the Cuban people.''
	   It said re-establishing the holiday was ``an act which does
justice to our Christian-based culture.'' It also came after a
request by Pope John Paul II, who visited Cuba in January.
	   The government granted a Christmas holiday last year as a
one-time favor to the pope, but it had balked at declaring the
measure permanent.
	   Despite increasing tensions between Cuban churches and a
government that declared itself atheist in 1962, Christmas remained
an official holiday in Cuba until 1969, when the government was
frantically throwing much of the country's resources into an
unsuccessful effort to harvest 10 million metric tons of sugar.
	   The government argued that holidays interfered with the harvest
and also canceled the New Year's holiday that year. The New Year's
holiday soon returned, but Christmas remained a day of work.
	   On Tuesday, the Communist Party said mechanization had reduced
the need for manpower in the sugar harvest.
	   In its declaration, the party insisted that the abolition of the
holiday in 1969 ``was not inspired by any anti-religious
sentiment'' and argued that the Cuban revolution had been far
easier on churches than revolutions in France, Russia and Mexico.
	   However, the government at the time was avowedly atheist and
often clashed with the Roman Catholic hierarchy.
	   Christians were barred from being members of the Communist Party
and from holding many sensitive jobs. Even followers of Afro-Cuban
religions were considered unreliable, according to official
documents.
	   Displaying a Christmas tree at that time could lead to conflicts
with neighborhood Communist Party officials.
	   In 1976, Cuba's constitution guaranteed freedom of religion and
in 1991, the Communist Party dropped its ban on religious
believers. A year later, Cuba declared itself a secular rather than
an atheist state.
	   Restrictions on believers have fallen away and church-state
relations have grown steadily warmer, capped by the papal visit.
	   This year, even state stores were selling plastic Christmas
trees and ornaments.
	   Tuesday's declaration ``is a signal of an opening, a
rapprochement or reconciliation with the churches,'' said Josue
Ladron de Guevara, 27, a Methodist minister from the eastern city
of Santiago who was attending a religious workshop in Havana.
	   ``This is a dream that we have had for a long time,'' he added.
	   In its statement, the party praised churches for condemning the
U.S. embargo of Cuba, for sending aid and for speaking out in favor
of social justice around the world.
	   But it also alluded to old frictions, saying that
``counterrevolutionaries'' had long tried to create ``divisions and
conflicts between religion and revolution.''
	   It noted that ``some members of religious institutions'' _ a
reference to Roman Catholic leaders _ had helped in the ``monstrous
kidnapping'' of some 15,000 Cuban children who were sent by their
families to the United States in the early 1960s to save them from
communist education in Cuba.
	   Arguing that abolishing the holiday had been strictly an
economic decision, the party said northern industrial countries
were ``virtually covered in snow'' at Christmas and could afford to
grant a holiday, while tropical countries such as Cuba were in the
midst of crucial harvests.
	   Most of Cuba's tropical neighbors, however, have always granted
Christmas holidays.

Udinese downs Parma 3-2 in first-leg game of quarterfinals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UDINE, Italy (AP) _ Argentine defender Mauro Esteban Navas
scored the game winner in second-half injury time as Udinese downed
Parma 3-2 in a first-leg game of the Italian Cup quarterfinals
Tuesday night.
	   The powerful long-distance drive by Navas in the 92nd could not
be stopped by Hernan Crespo, Parma's Argentine striker who played
the final minutes as keeper to substitute for injured goalie Matteo
Guardalben.
	   Crespo had tallied Parma's 2-2 equalizer in the 76th minute
before being forced between his team posts.
	   Guardalben could not be replaced by another keeper when he was
injured in the 85th as Parma had already completed the allowed
substitutions.
	   It was an unexpected loss for the Parma team which came from a
4-0 rout of AC Milan in a league match last Sunday. The home
triumph vaulted Parma to second place in the Serie A standings.
	   Ghanian teenage star Stephan Appiah put Udinese in front with a
right drive from 8 meters in the 39th minute at the Friuli stadium.
	   Argentine veteran striker Abel Balbo needed only two minutes to
tie the score in the 41st, on a perfect pass by teammate Diego
Fuser.
	   Brazilian striker Amoruso, who has tallied 8 goals in 11 league
matches, gave Udinese a 2-1 lead in the 46th with a precise
diagonal shot.
	   Amoruso was warmly applauded by the partisan crowd as he left
the field, with a light chest bruise, in the 65th.
	   Crespo, rested for most of the game, made it 2-2 minutes after
entering the field and shortly before the unhappy end as a keeper.
	   The first-leg program of the Italian Cup continues Wednesday
with second-division Atalanta hosting Serie A leader Fiorentina.
	   In a clash between soccer powerhouses Lazio takes on
Internazionale of Milan at Rome's Olympic stadium Thursday.
	   Juventus plays Bologna on Jan. 13, in a match postponed for the
Champions Cup commitments of the Turin team at Istanbul Wednesday.
	   Second-leg games are scheduled on Jan. 26.

Tyson offers no contest plea on assault charges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to all needing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROCKVILLE, Maryland (AP) _ Mike Tyson pleaded no contest on
Tuesday to charges he assaulted two men following a traffic
accident.
	   Although the plea is not an admission of guilt, Tyson faces up
to 20 years in prison _ 10 years on each count _ when he is
sentenced early next year.
	   ``He admits to losing his temper on the side of the road,''
Tyson attorney Paul Kemp said.
	   Tyson told Judge Steven Johnson he was not promised leniency and
does not expect preferential treatment in sentencing. He also said
he was aware his plea could affect his probation for a 1992 rape
conviction in Indiana.
	   ``The state was prepared to present the facts in the case,''
said Assistant State's Attorney Carol Crawford, objecting to
Johnson acceptance of the plea.
	   The charges stem from an Aug. 31 accident involving his wife,
Monica, in Montgomery County, in suburban Washington, D.C.
	   Abmielec Saucedo and Richard Hardick said Tyson kicked and
punched them following the accident. They have reached an
out-of-court settlement with Tyson to avoid a civil suit in the
case.
	   ``The complainants will testify at sentencing that this is the
appropriate plea,'' Kemp said.
	   Outside court, Tyson would not discuss the incident, although he
did talk about a Jan. 16 bout against Francois Botha. The Nevada
Athletic Commission returned Tyson's boxing license in October. It
was revoked after he bit champion Evander Holyfield's ears during a
June 1997 title bout.

Pak staying with Leadbetter as coach
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ Even when she had to go 20 extra holes
to win the U.S. Women's Open, Se Ri Pak had a way of making golf
look easy _ smooth swing, remarkable patience and unwavering
concentration.
	   If only the rest of her life were that simple.
	   The past six weeks have offered a glimpse of how the brightest
star in women's golf since Nancy Lopez ultimately may not have
enough space _ not to mention freedom _ for her potential to
blossom.
	   During the LPGA Tour Championship in Las Vegas, the 20-year-old
rookie hit balls for Butch Harmon and played nine holes with his
most important client, Tiger Woods. Shortly thereafter, reports
surfaced that Pak would leave swing coach David Leadbetter at the
end of the year to join Harmon's stable.
	   But late last week, Pak was back on the range in Orlando,
Florida with Leadbetter at her side and her father nodding his
approval.
	   ``They want to continue our relationship,'' Leadbetter said.
``Everything was blown out of proportion. According to her, they
want me to help her to get to No. 1.''
	   This was confirmed by Pak in a release issued by Samsung, the
Korean electronics giant that sponsors Pak and ultimately calls all
the shots.
	   ``My intentions were misinterpreted,'' Pak said. She added that
she enjoyed playing with Woods and meeting Harmon, but then
expressed ``great appreciation'' for Leadbetter.
	   Leadbetter, who earlier this year received a letter from Nick
Faldo terminating their relationship, sounded as much relieved as
he was perplexed. He has traveled the world having worked for Faldo
and Nick Price, Ernie Els and Greg Norman. Still, he has never come
across a situation like this one.
	   ``It's quite hard to make out,'' he said. ``She has a lot of
complex things in her life, and the Korean mentality is a little
different than what seems to be normal in the West. She's got so
many people involved _ a manager, Samsung has another set of
managers, family friends, an uncle, a father who doesn't speak
English. It's a tough deal.''
	   Imagine what it has been like for Pak.
	   Expectations in South Korea may be higher than anything Woods
ever faced in America after he won the Masters. At least two dozen
Korean photographers followed her every move this year, especially
after she won the LPGA Championship and the U.S. Open.
	   That was one reason Pak was reluctant to go home for a week of
blockbuster celebrations the last week of October.
	   The news conference upon her arrival at the airport had to be
stopped after 10 minutes because of the crowd. Her face was
plastered on the front pages of almost every major newspaper. She
was the lead item on the television news.
	   ``While I am here, I want to take a rest, no matter what,'' Pak
said. ``Going shopping and gossiping with friends, that's what I
want the most.''
	   Fat chance. Her week was loaded down with appearances and golf
tournaments, a parade and a medal ceremony with the president.
Small wonder that Pak spent most of the week in a hospital
recovering from a cold and exhaustion.
	   She wound up pulling out of the Japan Classic, which in effect
ended any chance Pak had of catching Annika Sorenstam in the points
race for player of the year.
	   But then, the way her whirlwind season had been going, she
didn't have much of a kick left in her. During one stretch this
season, Pak played 11 out of 13 weeks. After winning the Open, she
played the next four tournaments.
	   ``That really did her in,'' Leadbetter said. ``She was playing
on momentum and adrenaline, and everybody wanted her to play. It
was way too much. She wasn't working out, she lost her fitness
level. All these were contributing factors.''
	   Pak hasn't won since beating Dottie Pepper down the stretch to
capture the Giant Eagle Classic on July 26. In her final nine
tournaments of the year, she finished inside the top 10 only once,
and her scoring average was 71.9, nearly one stroke higher than her
first 18 tournaments.
	   ``It doesn't matter how good a horse is, you can't race it every
week,'' Leadbetter said.
	   And that's why his next piece of advice may have more to do with
``shopping and gossiping'' than alignment and hip rotation. While
playing golf with Woods, Pak says she was inspired how to enjoy
golf and how to enjoy life.
	   ``We can't forget that she's just a kid,'' Leadbetter said.
	   That's an important reminder for Pak _ and everyone around her.

San Lorenzo meets Cruziero in Wednesday's Copa Mercosur semifinal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Argentina's San Lorenzo hopes a
well-rested squad will give them a lift over Brazil's Cruzeiro
Wednesday to advance to the Mercosur Cup finals.
	   The Argentine team lost the first semifinal leg in Brazil, 1-0,
and now needs a win plus a goal differential advantage to face
Brazil's Palmeiras in the tournament's finals.
	   ``This game is life or death,'' said San Lorenzo coach Alfio
Basile, who rested his players during recent league matches in
preparation for Wednesday's game.
	   Basile said his team is nearly injury-free except for striker
Alberto Acosta who is still bothered by a left leg injury but is
expected to play.
	   Now that Boca Juniors has won the Argentine league championship,
San Lorenzo is hoping a good showing in Mercosur Cup will generate
momentum for next season.
	   The game is scheduled to begin at 0010 GMT.
	   Probable lineups:
	   San Lorenzo: Oscar Passet, Horacio Ameli, Eduardo Tuzzio, Ivan
Cordoba, Eduardo Coudet, Claudio Rivadero, Federico Lussenhoff,
Federico Basabilvaso, Nestor Gorosito, Raul Estevez and Alberto
Acosta.
	   Cruzeiro: Paulo Cesar, Gustavo, Marcelo Dijan, Gottardo,
Gilberto, Marcos Paulo, Djair, Valdo, Muller, Marcelo Ramos and
Fabio Junior.

Government warns of action against Kosovo rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS graf 10 to FIX attribution. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The government of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic accused Kosovo rebels Tuesday of endangering the
province's shaky peace, warning it won't tolerate continued attacks
``no matter what the price.''
	   In a statement sent to the Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe, the government blasted international efforts
to include the rebels in the peace process for effectively
``legalizing the terrorists.''
	   ``Insolent, criminal activity and provocative actions by
Albanian terrorists present an obstacle to the peace process ... in
defiance of state bodies and international appeals,'' said the
statement carried by the official Tanjug news agency.
	   The strongly worded statement, issued on the eve of an OSCE
meeting on Kosovo in Oslo, Norway, signaled Milosevic's defiance as
U.S. and other international mediators intensify efforts to
negotiate a solution for Kosovo.
	   A Serb government crackdown against the KLA earlier this year
claimed hundreds of lives and made some 300,000 people homeless.
There are fears that the province could explode in renewed fighting
next spring if a political solution is not found.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill is due in Belgrade on Wednesday with
a reworked version of his draft plan for Kosovo. Hill has sought
KLA support for the draft.
	   Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, has rejected the
plan because it would loosen its control over the southern
province, whose population is dominated by independence-minded
ethnic Albanians.
	   The government is proposing a form of self-rule that would keep
Kosovo firmly within Serbia.
	   But in the statement Tuesday the Yugoslav government harshly
objected to involving the KLA in the peace process and accused
ethnic Albanian politicians of supporting the rebels.
	   ``Without a resolute condemnation and adequate measures,
separatists and terrorists will continue attacks against the
innocent population, which the state will not allow no matter what
the price,'' the statement said.
	   The government accused the KLA rebels of carrying out 310
attacks since Milosevic and U.S. mediators negotiated an end to
seven months of violence on Oct. 12. The statement said nine
policemen and six civilians had been killed since then.
	   The October deal called for withdrawal of most of Serb-led
forces from Kosovo. An OSCE verifying mission is to observe the
cease-fire.
	   ``The aim of terrorists and separatists is not a political
solution ... but terror, violence and an attempt to change the
borders,'' the government said.
	   It blasted ``contacts that representatives of various countries
and organizations keep with terrorists, killers, kidnappers,
bandits and other criminals that call themselves the KLA.''
	   ``Such actions undermine a true political process and peaceful
solution,'' the government warned.

LPGA Tour getting stronger and richer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ When Jim Ritts was appointed LPGA
commissioner in June 1995, he laid out a three-year goal for the
women to play at least 40 tournaments for just over dlrs 30 million
in prize money.
	   ``We've gotten there faster than I thought we would,'' Ritts
said this week.
	   The LPGA schedule features 43 tournaments next year with total
prize money of at least dlrs 36.2 million, up nearly 50 percent
from when Ritts took over. Almost half of the tournaments have
increased their purses, and 11 will offer dlrs 1 million or more.
	   The heart of the schedule is in June _ four tournaments with at
least dlrs 1 million purses, two of them major championships.
	   ``The way our summer looks in 1999 is how I would like to see
our entire schedule look in 2001,'' Ritts said. ``We've got to
stretch a little bit in all of this, but the relationship that we
have between the tour and the sponsors have never been more
positive than it is now.''
	   The tour lost a couple of sponsors and a couple of tournaments
this year, but that is no longer cause for panic. Among the
additions for 1999 are events in Naples, Fla.; Boston; Columbus,
Ohio; and Austin, Texas, the first full-field tournament in the
Lone Star State since 1986.
	   Ritts said most sponsors are under three-to-five-year contracts,
and many of them are from outside the traditional golf market.
	   ``As companies have increasingly moved to dual audiences, the
LPGA has clearly become one of the alternatives to them,'' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DALY DOWN: &LR;  John Daly may have arrived at another crossroads in
his ongoing recovery from alcoholism _ coping with Sunday pressure.
	   Twice in the past two weeks, Daly has been in the hunt on the
final nine holes and came up short.
	   He missed two short putts on the closing holes in the World Cup
of Golf, where he and teammate Scott Verplank finished two strokes
out of the lead. In the Hong Kong Open last week, Daly was done it
by three bogeys on the last five holes.
	   ``I just cannot handle the pressure anymore,'' Daly said after
the Hong Kong Open, where he finished at 5-under 279, seven strokes
back. ``When I got to 6- or 7-under, I started gagging it. I cannot
handle the nerves like I used to. It's tough.
	   ``It does not really give me encouragement to play like that and
miss out because of the pressure,'' he said. ``It hurts more than
it helps.''
	   Daly will tee it up Thursday with Laura Davies in the mixed team
JCPenney Classic, his last event until next season.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; BALL TEST: &LR;  The USGA has sent notice to manufacturers that its
overall distance and initial velocity standards for golf balls will
change by the spring of 2000.
	   Since 1941, the USGA has measured initial velocity using a wheel
that strikes the ball at 143 mph (230 kmph). Under the new
proposal, the wheel will be replaced by an air cannon that fires a
ball at 180 mph (290 kmph) at an 8-ounce (2224-gram) plate, about
the same weight of a driver.
	   Titleist chief Wally Uihlein, still steamed over the spring-like
effect test for drivers, said the ball proposal was simply another
example of the USGA abusing its power.
	   ``Are we expected to believe that after using a test for 57
years, the USGA has now suddenly and mysteriously found some new
way of measuring a golf ball's initial velocity?'' Uihlein said.
	   USGA spokesman Marty Parkes said a test protocol should be
finalized in time for the annual meeting in February, and it then
would be open for comment from manufacturers.
	   ``This exercise is not designed to kick hundreds of balls off
the conforming list,'' Parkes said. ``There may be a few that won't
make it, but I don't think you'll see huge numbers one way or the
other.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; COMING UP ROSES: &LR;  More than four months after his four
brilliant days at Royal Birkdale, Justin Rose continues to reap the
benefits from his fourth-place finish in the British Open.
	   The English teen-ager got his second major endorsement this week
from Taylor Made _ a three-year deal in which he will wear the hat
and play the clubs.
	   ``We like to do our contracts where we give a base foundation to
stand on,'' said Debbie Hall, tour relations director for Taylor
Made. ``And if they play well, they can make some money.''
	   But where? Not only did Rose miss every cut since turning pro
after the Open, he didn't even make it through Europe's qualifying
school and will likely spend most of his time on Europe's version
of the Nike Tour.
	   Taylor Made is hoping to get a bang for its bucks down the road.
Hall is quick to point out that David Duval was on the Nike Tour
not too long ago and has finished no worse than 11th on the money
list each of the past four years.
	   ``We're banking on Justin to do that,'' Hall said.
	   Rose earlier signed an incentive-laden deal to play the Maxfli
Revolution ball.

Puerto Rico a site for relocated Panama anti-drug base
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Colombia-US &QL; 
 &UR; By JARED KOTLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) _ U.S. counternarcotics operations
currently based in Panama will move to Puerto Rico and elsewhere
when Washington completes its troop pullout from Panama next year,
a senior U.S. commander said Tuesday.
	   ``In a certain sense you can look at Puerto Rico as a partial
replacement for Panama,'' said Marine Gen. Charles E. Wilhelm,
chief of the U.S. Southern Command with responsibility for Latin
America, during a meeting of regional defense ministers.
	   Wilhelm was accompanying U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen,
who said the United States had ``not made much progress to date''
in deciding which other Latin American and Caribbean countries
would share in hosting the relocated counter-narcotics forces.
	   Negotiations to maintain a U.S. troop presence for
anti-narcotics purposes in Panama were scuttled in September,
setting U.S. officials on a search for alternatives. All U.S.
troops must leave the country by Dec. 31, 1999, when the Panama
canal reverts to Panamanian control.
	   Panama was considered the ideal base for drug interdiction, due
to its central location along shipment routes between Andean
cocaine- and heroin-producing countries and the United States.
Currently, U.S. AWACs radar planes track drug flights through the
region from Howard Air Force Base in Panama. The facility will be
closed in May.
	   Wilhem didn't say which other countries might accept a U.S.
presence, saying only that they were in the southern Caribbean,
Central America and ``the Andean ridge'' _ which includes Colombia,
Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru.

Slobodan Milosevic accused Kosovo rebels Tuesday of endangering the

Boeing cutting an additional 20,000 jobs due to Asian crisis

<TEXT>
	   SEATTLE (AP) _ Boeing Co. said Tuesday it will cut an additional
20,000 workers over the next two years as the company scales back
production of several commercial jet lines due largely to
slackening demand because of the Asian economic crisis.
	   The new cuts will bring the total reductions in Boeing's work
force to 48,000 jobs, or a 20 percent drop from the high level of
238,000 reached in June of this year. In July, the company
announced that it would trim 28,000 jobs.
	   ``Clearly, the economic slowdown in Asia is driving air traffic
down which impacts our customers' plans and operations,'' Alan
Mulally, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group president said Tuesday.
``Our actions today will match production to market demand to
support our customers.''
	   Boeing, which early had projected 1999 net earnings at about
dlrs 2 billion now said it was forecasting next year's profits at
dlrs 1.5 billion to dlrs 1.8 billion. It said 1998 profits were
expected to be slightly above dlrs 1 billion, as earlier forecast.
	   Boeing presently is rolling out 51 planes a month, said
spokesman Larry McCracken. He said that will drop to 47 at the end
of next year and 38.5 planes a month by the end of 2000.
	   The company said it would reduce production of 747 jetliners
from 3.5 to two airplanes per month late next year, and to just one
per month in early 2000 if market conditions fail to improve.
	   Production of 757 jetliners will drop from five to four
airplanes per month and the 767 program will drop from four to 3.5
airplanes per month in early 2000.
	   The 777 program, currently scheduled to be reduced from seven to
five planes per month in fourth quarter of 1999, is now projected
to remain at the lower rate in 2000.
	   Boeing will increase production on its new-generation 737s as
scheduled to 24 planes per month, and it will remain at that rate
until late 2000 when it will decrease to 21 a month.
	   Air traffic growth in many Asian markets has plummeted as the
countries grapple with their worst currency crisis in decades. Many
Asian airlines have reported operating losses or reduced profits
since the crisis began, Boeing officials say.

Study: Shopping hazardous to men's health

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Men who detest Christmas shopping have a new
excuse to avoid the chore _ it's hazardous to the their health.
	   Male stress levels skyrocket when they're confronted with facing
crowded stores, choosing gifts and standing in check-out lines, a
new British study shows.
	   ``The peak stress levels were equivalent to emergency situations
experienced by fighter pilots or policemen going into dangerous
situations,'' said psychologist David Lewis, who did the research.
	   The study, commissioned by the Brent Cross Shopping Center in
north London, sent about three dozen men and women of different
ages to stores with identical Christmas lists. Some went alone
while others were accompanied by children.
	   An accompanying researcher recorded periodic blood pressure and
heart rate figures during the trips. Further information regarding
how survey participants were chosen and specific numbers of men and
women involved were not immediately available.
	   Every man in the survey suffered considerable increases in blood
pressure and heart rates while only one in four women registered a
significant change.
	   ``For men, even the thought of going shopping was enough to send
stress levels soaring,'' Lewis said. ``Over 70 percent of them
recorded above-average readings before even stepping out the front
door.''
	   Most men surveyed admitted that the stress of Christmas shopping
would make them choose the first gift they see rather than spend
time in crowded stores considering the options.
	   The type of store can have an effect on men, too. Retailers
playing loud music in a crowded atmosphere sent blood pressures
soaring in two-thirds of the men.
	   ``Almost all the women who went shopping with their partners
regretted the decision and, surprisingly, stress levels were
considerably lower for those who shopped with children than those
who took boyfriends or husbands,'' Lewis said.

Tyson pleads no contest to assault charges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with additional background; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By DERRILL HOLLY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROCKVILLE, Maryland (AP) _ Mike Tyson pleaded no contest Tuesday
to misdemeanor assault, a decision that could return the former
heavyweight champion to prison.
	   Although the plea to the two counts is not an admission of
guilt, Tyson faces up to 20 years in prison _ 10 years on each
count _ when he is sentenced early next year by a Maryland judge.
He also could be fined up to dlrs 2,500 on each count.
	   The charges stem from an Aug. 31 traffic accident in Montgomery
County, Md., involving Tyson's wife, Monica. Tyson was accused of
kicking and punching two motorists after the accident.
	   ``You understand that this plea could affect your parole,''
Judge Steven Johnson told Tyson before accepting his plea.
	   ``I'm truly aware of that,'' said Tyson, who was released from
prison in 1995 after serving three years of six-year sentence for a
1992 rape conviction in Indiana.
	   Tyson, who is scheduled to fight Francois Botha on Jan. 16,
would not discuss his case outside court.
	   It will be up to Indiana authorities to decide whether the
no-contest pleas violated his probation.
	   By late Tuesday afternoon, Marion County (Indiana) Superior
Court Judge Patricia Gifford had not heard from probation officials
about Tyson, her clerk, Becky Wagner, said. She said probation
officials would decide whether to request a violation hearing for
Tyson.
	   George Walker, chief probation officer for Marion County, was
out of the office until Wednesday.
	   Tyson told Johnson he did not expect leniency or a lighter
sentence in return for entering the no-contest pleas.
	   The prosecutor urged that jail time be included in the
punishment.
	   ``The state opposes any probation before judgment,'' said
Assistant State's Attorney Carol Crawford.
	   Tyson's lawyer, Paul Kemp, said the plea was an appropriate
resolution to the case.
	   ``Mr. Tyson certainly concedes that things occurred that were
inappropriate,'' Kemp said.
	   Following the August accident, Abmielec Saucedo and Richard
Hardick said Tyson attacked them. They have reached a settlement
with Tyson to avoid a civil suit.
	   Kemp said Saucedo and Hardick are prepared to testify at
sentencing that they support Tyson's no-contest plea.
	   ``He does not admit to intentionally striking anyone when this
incident occurred,'' Kemp said.
	   Kemp told the judge that Tyson became angry when neither Hardick
nor Saucedo expressed concern for his wife, who was driving when
the accident occurred.
	   Kemp admitted that Hardick was struck with a glancing blow and
Saucedo was inadvertently kicked as the boxer was restrained by his
wife and bodyguard.
	   Tyson is undergoing psychiatric treatment, one of the conditions
that led to reinstatement of his boxing license by the Nevada
Athletic Commission in October. The license was revoked after he
bit champion Evander Holyfield's ears during a June 1997 title
bout.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Archaeology, one of Israel's biggest tourist
attractions, suffered a blow Tuesday when most of its excavations
were shut down.
	   The Israel Antiquities Authority halted its salvage digs _
carried out ahead of most construction projects _ after the Supreme
Court ruled that developers and builders cannot be billed for these
excavations.
	   In the country of Jesus and King Solomon, Richard the Lion
Hearted and Saladin, the Arab conqueror who battled the crusaders
in the streets of Jerusalem, it is almost impossible to start a
building or a road without uncovering ancient remains.
	   In response to a petition from a developer, however, the Supreme
Court ruled Sunday that the government, not the builder, must bear
the costs of the salvage digs, operated by the Antiquities
Authority.
	   In response, the Antiquities Authority decided Tuesday to halt
all salvage digs which account for about 300 of the 350 excavations
carried out in Israel each year.
	   ``We have no budget for salvage digs,'' said Antiquities
Authority spokeswoman Osnat Gouez.
	   Major digs open to the public like those in Jerusalem, Caesarea
and Beit Shean have been drastically curtailed for lack of
government funding, Gouez said.
	   In the archaeological sense, Israel is the one of the most
crowded countries in the world, with some 25,000 known sites
excavated or waiting to be dug up.

On to New Zealand: Roiling oceans await solo sailors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHEILA NORMAN-CULP &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Those who dare to challenge the oceans solo say
the first 7,000 miles (11,200 kilometers) of the Around Alone
sailing race were exhausting. The next 6,884 miles (11,014
kilometers) will be harrowing.
	   Fifteen sailors and their crews are in Cape Town, South Africa,
this week, wrapping up weeks of repairs and restocking their 40-
to-60-foot (12- to-18-meter) boats.
	   On Saturday, they head to Auckland, New Zealand, for the second
leg of the four-part, nine-month race.
	   This section runs through a roiling stretch of water _ where the
Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans merge. Aside from the tip of
South America, there is no land to interrupt the free flow of wind.
	   It's not for nothing they call it the Roaring Forties _ below 40
degrees south latitude.
	   Mike Golding of Britain won the first leg by just 2 1/2 hours,
smashing the speed record from Charleston, South Carolina to Cape
Town. He arrived Oct. 31 after 34 days, 18 hours, 54 minutes and 44
seconds at sea.
	   The second- and third-place finishers _ Isabelle Autissier and
Marc Thiercelin, both of France _ also broke the mark set by
Autissier in 1994, the last time this race was held.
	   Jean-Pierre Mouligne of France won the Class II category, for
boats up to 50 feet (15 meters) long, followed by Michael Garside
of Britain and Brad Van Liew of the United States.
	   Other racers took up to 62 days to reach Cape Town, with the
last, Fedor Konioukhov of Russia, arriving just hours before the
disqualification deadline Nov. 28. It was not clear Tuesday night
if he would finish his repairs in time to leave with the other
boats Saturday.
	   ``This leg was exhausting for everyone, both physically and
psychologically. It put all of us _ both boats and skippers _
through the wringer. Being so close to each other pushed each of us
to our utmost,'' Autissier said.
	   If the first leg was a tactical chess match, where racers
gambled on the right moment to skirt the mid-Atlantic doldrums and
head east toward Africa, the second leg will be a flat-out
roller-coaster ride.
	   ``The first boat to make it into the strong westerlies should
have a big advantage,'' race director Mark Schrader said Monday.
	   He also noted that crash helmets were among the many safety
items issued. ``On 380-plus mile (610-plus kilometer) days, the
motion and the noise is incredible,'' he said.
	   Sailors who get ahead of high pressure systems will be surfing
down 40-foot (12-meter) waves with the smallest sails in their
arsenal, praying the heavy gauge metal shrouds holding up their
seven-story masts don't crumple under the onslaught.
	   Those who get stuck behind low pressure systems will have the
same icy seas smashing into them.
	   Autissier knows all about those seas. A rogue wave flipped and
demasted her 60-foot (18-meter) yacht on this leg in 1994, ending
her quest to win the around-the-world race after she had beaten
others by five days on the first leg. An Australian rescue
helicopter saved her life.
	   This time, she is reinforcing her lines, bringing a smaller
mainsail, packing lots of spare parts and adding a heater _ to ward
off the bitter cold from the constant storms.
	   The Around Alone competitors this year range from 30 to 64 years
old and are a veritable United Nations of the sea: three each from
France, Britain and the United States, two from Russia and one
apiece from Italy, Australia, South Africa and Japan. Autissier is
the only woman.
	   The three Americans include the 30-year-old Van Liew, Robin
Davie, 47, of Charleston, and George Stricker, 62, a native of
Newport, Kentucky.
	   All the sailors emerged from the first leg with astonishing
tales of courage and willpower.
	   Viktor Yazykov of Russia made headlines by performing surgery on
his infected elbow, using E-mail instructions from a Boston doctor.
	   Autissier had to scale her 85-foot (26-meter) mast to fix a
broken halyard, the line that keeps the sails up. Davie broke his
rudder midway, and then ran out of food as he approached Cape Town.
Thiercelin's mainsail ripped into shreds in a gale. Konioukhov's
water ballast system failed, leaving him unable to move upwind and
at times thousands of miles behind his competitors.
	   And nearly everyone's autopilot steering system broke down at
some point, so the racers could barely sleep two hours at a time.
	   Even Konioukhov, who has climbed Mount Everest and skied to both
poles, was daunted.
	   ``On this race the danger is for two months _ and that is just
leg one,'' he said in Cape Town. ``Compared to Everest, this is
very difficult.''

Investigating pathologist casts doubt on knife used in Bermuda
</HEADLINE>
killing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) _ An investigator on Tuesday cast doubt
on whether a knife found near the body of a Canadian teen-ager
killed in July 1996 was used in the crime.
	   Pathologist James Johnston told a jury in Bermuda that the
serrated steak knife was rusty and covered with crustaceans,
suggesting it had been in the water near the crime scene for some
time before the killing of 17-year-old Rebecca Middleton.
	   Johnston testified as a prosecution witness during the trial of
19-year-old Justis Smith, who is accused of killing Middleton along
with another man, Kirk Mundy. Mundy is serving five years in jail
after pleading guilty to being an accessory to the crime in October
1996.
	   Johnston also said her wounds did not look as if they were made
by a serrated blade, but noted the width of cuts was consistent
with the width of the blade.
	   He said Middleton was slashed 16 times and three of the cuts
were fatal.
	   Prosecutors claim Middleton, a native of Belleville, Ontario,
was raped and killed after she accepted a motorcycle ride from the
two men. She was in Bermuda on vacation and was found dead near
Ferry Reach.
	   The trial continues Wednesday.

Holders Chelsea out of League Cup

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Holders Chelsea were knocked out of the League Cup
Tuesday as Premier League rival Wimbledon won 2-1 in a quarterfinal
match on goals by Robbie Earle and a penalty 15 minutes from time
by Michael Hughes.
	   Chelsea's player-coach Gianluca Vialli scored with six minutes
remaining to make the final minutes interesting.
	   It was a bad night for French defender Frank Leboeuf as
Chelsea's 19-game unbeaten string ended.
	   Leboeuf gave away a free kick from which Earle headed the Dons
in front after 19 minutes. And his misery was compounded at the end
when he brought down Marcus Gayle to hand the home side a penalty,
which Hughes converted.
	   ``If we win the next round we will be at Wembley but there is no
point looking so far forward,'' said Hughes. ``We are a small club
and have no money to buy 5 or 6-million (pound) players. But we
have quality players here and we work very hard for each other.''
	   In Tuesday's other League Cup quarterfinal, the first division's
first-place team Sunderland defeated second-division Luton 3-0 to
reach the semifinals of the League Cup for the first time in 14
years.
	   Sunderland took a 1-0 lead on Marvin Johnson's own-goal five
minutes before the half. Michael Bridges made it 2-0 in the 89th
and Niall Quinn made it 3-0 in second-half injury time.
	   In an F.A. Cup first-round replay, Notts County won 3-0 over
semi-pro side Hendon. In another first-round replay, Kidderminster
and Plymouth played a 0-0 draw after extra time with Kidderminster
winning 5-4 on penalties.

Puerto Rico poll: Statehood gets plurality; mixed message for
</HEADLINE>
Washington &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Nearly 40 percent of Puerto Ricans
say they want statehood, but almost as many want to remain a
commonwealth of the United States, according to a newspaper poll.
	   According to the poll published Tuesday in The San Juan Star, 39
percent of those surveyed said they would vote for statehood in a
Dec. 13 referendum called by pro-statehood Gov. Pedro Rossello.
	   Rossello hopes the vote will encourage the U.S. Congress to
clear up the Caribbean island's ambiguous relationship with
Washington as a U.S. commonwealth. Congress has suggested that
anything less than a majority vote for statehood would not be
enough to change Puerto Rico's status.
	   In the poll, 16 percent of voters said they were undecided.
	   Two other options on the ballot _ a U.S. commonwealth definition
rejected by the commonwealth party, and a ``free association'' of
an independent Puerto Rico with treaty ties to Washington _
received 3 percent and 7 percent, respectively.
	   However, 34 percent said they will vote for ``none of the
above,'' a protest position adopted by Puerto Rico's
pro-commonwealth party, while just 3 percent said they will vote
for total independence, the Star said.
	   Puerto Rico's opposition Popular Democratic Party has called on
its supporters to vote for ``none of the above,'' claiming that
Rossello's pro-statehood administration imposed its own ballot
definition of commonwealth _ one that calls for fewer local powers
for the Puerto Rican government and says that Congress has the
right to revoke islanders' U.S. citizenship.
	   The door-to-door poll of 1,049 registered voters was conducted
Nov. 7-17 by Precision Research Inc., a private polling firm, for
The Star. Its margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage
points.
	   Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens who cannot vote for president
and have no vote in Congress. They do not pay federal taxes but
receive limited federal benefits, and they can be drafted into the
military.
	   The Star said its poll suggests that Puerto Ricans may not send
a clear enough message to Congress.
	   In March, the U.S. House of Representatives narrowly approved a
measure obliging Congress to act on a series of binding Puerto
Rican status votes. The measure died in the U.S. Senate.
	   In a non-binding 1993 vote, commonwealth edged out statehood by
48.6 percent to 46.3 percent. Just over 4 percent voted for
independence.

Grenada's prime minister under pressure to call elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICHARD SIMON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ Opponents of Grenadian Prime
Minister Keith Mitchell have demanded he call new elections in the
wake of defections that have crippled his party.
	   Mitchell's foreign minister and former health minister switched
to the opposition Grenada United Labor Party on Sunday, robbing his
New National Party of its majority in the House of Representatives.
	   Reynold Benjamin, a former secretary general of Mitchell's
party, said Tuesday the prime minister should ``do the honorable
thing'' and ask Governor General Sir Daniel Williams to dissolve
parliament.
	   ``If he goes to parliament, he will be at the mercy of the
opposition members if they can stand together as a bloc,'' Benjamin
said.
	   Benjamin resigned from the New National Party in 1992 because of
differences with Mitchell.
	   The country's fiscal year ends next month, meaning a flurry of
budget work will need to be done.
	   ``The right thing to do is to get out and give someone else a
chance,'' said constitutional lawyer Robert Grant, who joined
Benjamin on a local news program. ``I do hope our prime minister
will realize this, and call an election and get a mandate if he
dares to rule this country again.''
	   Mitchell's party saw its 9-6 majority reversed to an 8-7 split
in favor of the opposition when foreign minister Raphael Fletcher
and former health minister Grace Duncan switched allegiances.
	   Duncan had been fired from the cabinet in 1997 because of
clashes with Mitchell, and Fletcher said he was unhappy with how
the prime minister was handling a government audit.
	   Mitchell himself came to power through a similar political coup
in 1989, when he abruptly withdrew support for an ally, former
prime minister Herbert Blaize, during a party convention. Blaize
led the government for a short period with a minority government
and died within months of the defeat.
	   After Mitchell's switch, Blaize warned his former ally that
``what goes around comes around.''

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Blue-chip stocks bounced back Tuesday from a
steep slide, with the profit-taking behind Monday's sharp downturn
easing just as the Dow slipped below 9,000. The Dow Jones
industrial average initially extended Monday's 214-point plunge by
another 128 points, but reversed course before midday and finished
16.99 points _ or by 0.2 percent _ higher at 9,133.54. The morning
slide had pulled the Dow as low as 8,987 and 400 points from last
Monday's record mark of 9,374.27. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Share prices dropped sharply on European stock
exchanges Tuesday in a swirl of gloom and profit-taking, following
big falls on Wall Street and in Asian markets. The London Stock
Exchange, Europe's largest, set the pace with a fall of 3.6 percent
on the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index. ``We have
seen quite a rally in the last week or so, but investors are
nervous,'' said Tessa Kohn-Speyer, investment analyst at Barclays
Stockbrokers in London.'' Key indexes were down 5.0 percent in
Germany, 4.2 percent in Milan and Zurich, 4.0 percent in Paris, 5.2
percent in Moscow, 6.1 percent in Budapest, 4.7 percent in
Amsterdam, 3.4 percent in Oslo, 3.2 percent in Dublin and Madrid,
2.7 percent Stockholm, 2.1 percent in Prague and 1.3 percent in
Copenhagen. (EUROPEAN-MARKETS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Pulling off the richest corporate takeover in
history, Exxon will buy Mobil for dlrs 77.2 billion to create the
world's largest company and reunite two of the biggest pieces left
by the breakup of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil empire. The
deal, announced Tuesday, joins the two largest U.S. oil and gas
companies. However, despite the massive size of the new Exxon Mobil
Corp., a world oil glut caused by overproduction and weak demand is
expected to keep pump prices at rock-bottom levels for now. Exxon
Mobil will surpass Royal Dutch-Shell Group as the No. 1 energy
company and vault past General Motors Corp. as the largest
corporation in the world, with dlrs 203 billion in combined revenue
last year. Exxon is about twice Mobil's size in annual revenue.
(US-EXXON-MOBIL)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Bent on surviving a new round of
mergers shaking up the global oil industry, French petroleum giant
Total is buying Belgian refiner Petrofina for dlrs 11.8 billion in
a deal that would create the world's fifth-largest oil company. The
announcement Tuesday came just hours ahead of news that the top
U.S. oil company, Exxon Corp., was buying the No. 2 company Mobil
Corp. for dlrs 77 billion in the richest corporate takeover in
history. The deal between Total and Petrofina, Belgium's biggest
industrial company, would create a new company, Total Fina, that
would be the third-largest oil company in Europe. Investors,
believing that Total may be paying too much for Petrofina, sent
Total's shares down 12 percent in Paris trading. Petrofina shares
rose 18 percent in Brussels. (BELGIUM-PETROFINA-TOTAL)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With a dlrs 22.6 billion loan for Russia hanging
in limbo, International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus
launched a new round of talks in Moscow on Tuesday on freeing up
the money. Yet Russia's government continued to put off tough
financial decisions the IMF says are necessary for releasing the
rest of the frozen loan, and Camdessus was not expected to announce
any breakthroughs. Camdessus met Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on
Tuesday night and is scheduled to hold broader talks with
government officials Wednesday. Russia, facing mounting debts to
workers, pensioners and foreign creditors, is seeking further
installments on a dlrs 22.6 billion IMF-led bailout package reached
in the summer. The loan was frozen after Russia succumbed to the
Asian economic crisis and devalued the ruble and defaulted on some
of its debts in August. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ With just a month to go before the
launch of the euro, European Union finance ministers reached an
11th-hour agreement Tuesday on who should speak for the
single-currency bloc on the world stage. The agreement resolved
months of deadlock between big and small euro-zone nations over
representation of the 11-nation currency bloc at the G-7 group of
world economic powers and other international bodies. Under the
compromise, the euro-zone's three existing G-7 nations - Germany,
France and Italy - keep their seats and will take turns to
represent the bloc. Smaller nations will get to sit alongside them
at G-7 meetings, when they hold the rotating euro-zone presidency.
German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine will therefore speak for
the euro-zone for the first six months of 1999, to be joined by his
Finnish counterpart Sauli Niniisto for second half of the year.

	   Here is a summary of news from The Associated Press. Stories
carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items below have
moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   LONDON (AP) _ In an ambulance escorted by armed police, former
Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet left a hospital Tuesday and
moved into a luxurious home to continue fighting an effort to
extradite him on charges of genocide and torture. Demonstrators
shouted and shook their fists as Pinochet swept through the gates
of Grovelands Priory a day after the psychiatric hospital announced
that he is fit and demanded that he leave. The hospital's order
undermined any attempt by the 83-year-old general to plead that he
is too ill or frail to stand trial in Spain in the deaths and
torture of political opponents during his 1973-90 rule in Chile.
(BRITAIN-PINOCHET)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ In what could be a warmup for statehood, U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat have launched a new U.S.-Palestinian commission designed at
the outset to channel dlrs 900 million in new American aid to the
West Bank and Gaza. The landmark, one-hour meeting was held in
Albright's office near the end of Arafat's high-profile visit to
Washington in which he again asserted hopes for a state and called
east Jerusalem ``occupied territory.'' The commission is unique in
that other U.S. commissions are with prominent nations. Among them:
Russia, Mexico, South Africa, Egypt and Ukraine. James P. Rubin,
the State Department spokesman, said the new commission with the
Palestinians did not establish a state-to-state relationship.
(US-ARAFAT).
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The detention of two of China's most influential
dissidents and three other pro-democracy activists underscores the
government's stated determination to crush any challenge to
one-party Communist rule. Legislative chairman Li Peng, the
Communist Party's No. 2 man, was quoted as saying Tuesday that
Western-style democracy was inappropriate for China and that
opposition groups would not be tolerated. Police in two cities went
to the homes of Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin and other members of the
fledgling China Democracy Party on Monday night and took them away,
relatives and a human rights group said Tuesday. The police action
was one of the most severe since dissidents announced their attempt
to form an opposition group in June to challenge the Communist
Party's monopoly on power. (CHINA-DISSIDENTS)
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Christmas is back on Cuba's official calendar,
after nearly three decades in which political and economic concerns
made Dec. 25 just another day. Cubans said they look forward to the
chance to play, pray or just relax on the upcoming holiday. The
Communist Party used the entire front page of Cuba's only daily
newspaper, Granma, to recommend Tuesday that ``from this year on''
Dec. 25 be a permanent holiday in Cuba. Adoption by the Communist
government is assured. Cuba's Roman Catholic Church issued a
statement declaring that it ``highly values this gesture'' and
expressing confidence that ``the path of opening of Cuba'' would
lead to ``causes for joy, unity and hope for the Cuban people.''
The government granted a Christmas holiday last year as a one-time
favor to Pope John Paul II, who visited in January, but it had
balked at declaring the measure permanent. (CUBA-CHRISTMAS)
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Activists across the globe
marched in the streets, distributed condoms and held benefit
concerts Tuesday to try to halt the spread of AIDS, which will kill
millions of people this year alone. Underscoring events on World
AIDS Day was this sobering fact: Although powerful new medicines
are helping industrialized countries win the battle against the
disease, it has reached epidemic proportions in continents where
people can't afford the drugs. About 33.4 million people around the
world are infected with HIV, two-thirds of them in sub-Saharan
Africa. In Asia and the Pacific, 700,000 people become infected
with HIV per year. ``In the case of HIV/AIDS, the difference in
wealth becomes literally matter of life and death,'' decried Mary
Robinson, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.

Letter bomb explodes in Canberra
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia, (AP) _ A letter bomb exploded early
Wednesday morning at Canberra's regional mail center in the
industrial suburb of Fyshwick, injuring one postal worker.
	   Police said the man's injuries are not serious, but they have
closed the center, fearing that more devices might be present.
	   The ceiling of the building was damaged. The explosion occurred
in the early hours of Wednesday, local time.
	   Police say their inquiries might take a week.
	   ``It was a well-constructed, sophisticated letter bomb,' Police
Sgt. Ron Garbutt told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   ``To me that appears as though the person constructing it knew
what they were doing and was certainly not an amateurish attempt at
making a letter bomb.''
	   The police have no idea who the bomb was addressed to or where
it came from, Garbutt said.

 &UR; By ALFONSO ANZUETO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Human rights activists applauded the death
sentences handed down to a Guatemalan civil patrol that carried out
a 1982 massacre, but said Tuesday that the military commanders who
they said oversaw it must be punished as well.
	   A court in the central province of Baja Verapaz on Monday
sentenced to death three former members of an army-trained civilian
patrol for their role in the massacre of 130 civilians on March 13,
1982 in what has come to be known as the Massacre of Rio Negro.
	   Their convictions were the first for crimes committed in
Guatemala's 36-year civil war, which ended in 1996.
	   ``The investigation must remain open so that the masterminds of
the massacre, including high-ranking military officers, can be
brought to justice,'' said Walter Valencia of the Human Rights
Legal Action Center.
	   The men were convicted based on testimony from the survivors,
many of whom had campaigned for years to bring the killers to
justice.
	   The Rio Negro massacre was part of Guatemala's so-called
scorched earth campaign to root out civilian support for the
Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity supporters. Hundreds of
Maya Indian villages were razed during the early 1980s.
	   The motives in the Rio Negro massacre remain unclear; civil
defense patrols and soldiers carried out similar acts against
villages suspected of supporting leftist rebels, or simply because
of personal rivalries or land disputes.
	   What there is little doubt of is the methods they used to kill.
	   The defense patrols apparently began murdering villagers from
Rio Negro _ a tiny Achi Mayan Indian hamlet in the mountains 25
miles (40 kms) north of Guatemala City _ in February, 1982.
	   An estimated 150,000 people died in Guatemala's civil war and
thousands more were tortured or kidnapped. A report released
earlier this year by a Roman Catholic Church human rights office
blamed the army for nearly 80 percent of the killings.
	   Herlindo Hichos, a member of the Missing Persons' Relatives
Association, said legal proceedings ``must be brought against those
who ordered these criminal acts.''
	   Judge Otto Mayan Morales, who handed the sentences, said
authorities were searching for another nine patrol members who
participated in the massacre. But he said no soldiers were with the
patrol during the massacre.
	   The sentences in the city of Salama, 25 miles (40 kilometers)
north of Guatemala City, came as another war-crimes case against
soldiers reopened after a seven-month delay because the public
prosecutor received death threats and resigned.
	   The trial of 27 Guatemalan soldiers accused in the 1995 Xaman
massacre reopened Nov. 25 with a new prosecutor, Alejandro Nunez
Pivarel.
	   Nunez said he would call 25 witnesses, including survivors of
the attack in the village of Xaman. Eleven people _ among them an
8-year-old boy _ died when a military patrol opened fire on
resettled refugees; 27 others were wounded.
	   The Xaman trial is the first in Guatemala to take members of the
armed forces to court for any of the 424 massacres attributed to
them during the civil war.

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Police issued a nationwide postal
alert after finding 21 more parcel bombs at a Canberra mail
processing center where a bomb exploded early Wednesday morning.
	   A postal worker was slightly injured by shrapnel when a package
detonated. A search of the building found 21 more bombs.
	   Australian Federal Police said an identical parcel bomb was
discovered in Sydney on Tuesday, taking to 23 in all the number of
bombs found so far.
	   The Sydney parcel was detonated by bomb squad police after the
person to whom it was delivered became suspicious.
	   Federal Police Superintendent Geoff Hazel said the bomber
targeted a specific segment of the community but he declined to
identify them publicly for fear of compromising the investigation.
	   The parcels are white and similar in size to a computer disc
storage box, bearing a 2-dollar stamp and a 30-cent stamp.

Dollar lower against yen, Japanese stocks rise in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen early
Wednesday, largely carrying over its weakness overseas. Japanese
stock prices bounced back in light trading.
	   The dollar bought 121.84 yen in early trading, down 0.94 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level
of 122.17 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 161.51
points, or 1.09 percent, to 14,996.92 points in the first 30
minutes of trading. On Tuesday, the Nikkei closed down 48.29
points, or 0.32 percent.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar remained weak against the yen
partly after the release of disappointing U.S. economic data.
	   The National Association of Purchasing Management reported
Tuesday the manufacturing sector in the United States slowed for
the sixth consecutive month in November.
	   On the stock market, share prices rebounded on short covering
after falling moderately the past three trading sessions.
	   Market players said trading will likely remain in a narrow range
because of a lack of fresh news on the Japanese government's
economic policies. Parliament is discussing a government-sponsored
supplementary budget to spur the nation's sagging economy.
	   The Tokyo market was also supported by an overnight gain on Wall
Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average finished 16.99
points higher, or 0.2 percent, at 9,133.54, on Tuesday.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 5.69 points, or 0.50 percent, to 1,147.95. The TOPIX
closed down 1.24 points, or 0.11 percent, the day before.
	   The benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government bond was
quoted at 1.160 percent, up from Tuesday's close of 1.140 percent.
Its price fell to 105.49 yen from the previous day's 105.68.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ The government tested the quality
of teaching at Brazil's universities, and most of them got a
flunking grade.
	   The Education Ministry on Tuesday released findings of tests on
126,800 college students in 10 fields of study. In nine, the
average grade was below 40 on a scale of 100.
	   Dental students did the best with an average of 59, the ministry
said. Math majors finished last with 21, while chemical engineering
students got an average grade of 23.
	   ``The overall performance of the system is still
unsatisfactory,'' Education Minister Paulo Renato Souza said in
Brasilia, the capital. Teaching generally is poor, he said, and
students ``read little and study little.''
	   Public universities did better than private ones, the study
showed. The country's best schools are in Sao Paulo, Brazil's
richest and most populous state.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen met
with Central American counterparts on Tuesday and pledged continued
disaster relief from the nearly 3,000 U.S. military personnel in
the region.
	   To date, the U.S. military has deployed 2,645 of its personnel
to the region, flown 692 missions, and delivered four million
pounds of supplies as part of a dlrs 250 million U.S. aid effort to
the countries devastated by Hurricane Mitch, Cohen said.
	   As many as 10,000 people were killed by the storm which ripped
through the region at the end of October, causing massive flooding.
	   Central American delegates thanked Cohen, in town for a meeting
of defense ministers, for U.S. assistance and urged the United
States to remain supportive as the region moves from the emergency
relief phase to longer-term reconstruction.
	   ``We've regressed more than 20 years in terms of infrastructure
and the loss of human potential,'' said El Salvador's defense
minister, Gen. Jaime Guzman.
	   Nicaragua's defense minister, Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, said his
country's most pressing need was public health specialists to
prevent epidemics.
	   ___
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ A new leftist rebel group is active in
Ecuador and claimed responsibility for a dynamite attack on a
provincial government office, police said Tuesday.
	   Police have arrested three alleged members of the People's
Combatants Group. The group said it bombed the governor's office in
the province of Manabi, 150 miles (240 kilometers) southwest of
Quito, on Nov. 16, Police Chief Jorge Villarroel said in a radio
interview. The bomb caused damage but no injuries.
	   Villarroel said the group was against the government and its
economic measures, and called for an ``armed struggle.''
	   President Jamil Mahuad took office in August and announced a
series of economic reforms _ which included ending subsidies on
electricity, cooking gas and diesel oil _ to rescue Ecuador's
bankrupt economy.
	   Since the announcement, three other minor bombings have occurred
in addition to the Manabi attack, including a dynamite stick thrown
into the U.S. Embassy compound in Quito.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican authorities withdrew an order for
five U.S. clergymen to leave the country after straying near rebel
territory in southern Mexico, saying they accepted the group's
explanation that it was an honest mistake.
	   The clergymen, part of a 29-member delegation of the
Chicago-based Pastors for Peace group, were briefly detained
Saturday when they traveled to the village of El Bosque during
their rounds delivering food to hungry Indians.
	   El Bosque wasn't on the itinerary they filed in their visa
applications. Since May, Mexico has required that foreign observers
or humanitarian workers list all places they intend to visit in
order to be granted a visa.
	   Andres Chao, spokesman for Mexico's immigration institute, said
Pastors for Peace President Lucius Walker traveled to Mexico City
to meet with immigration officials and to explain the group's
position.
	   Walker said the group of five had diverted their route because a
dirt road was impassable.
	   ``He accepted the error of having taken a route that wasn't
established,'' Chao said.
	   Two of the five clergymen left Mexico voluntarily on Monday, and
the other three had been ordered to leave by Friday. Chao said the
government had decided not to force them out because they accepted
their mistake.
	   Chao said the pastors had been detained for their own safety
because the area is near the zone of influence of Zapatista rebels,
who staged a brief uprising in January 1994. There has been little
fighting while peace talks with the government have stalled.

Taiwanese president wows voters in lively last campaign

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ It's the last journey down the campaign
trail for the man who brought democracy to Taiwan, and President
Lee Teng-hui is making the most of it.
	   Lee is putting on a lively show as he stumps across Taiwan to
help fellow Nationalist Party politicians in campaigning for
legislative and mayoral races ahead of Saturday's election.
	   In rural Chiayi city in the south, Lee put on a straw hat and
rode in to a rally site on a power tiller. In cosmopolitan Taipei,
Lee played star warrior and knight of the round table.
	   To appeal for party unity, the 75-year-old Lee has also appeared
on stages in a plumed hat as a tribal chief or wielding a bat as
the head of a baseball team.
	   The vote could influence the outcome of the next presidential
race in 16 months and is being watched closely by Beijing, which
considers Taiwan a part of China.
	   Lee says he will retire when his term ends after a career in
politics that has seen him change with the times _ now courting
voters with flashy gimmicks rather than long speeches on policy.
	   But Lee still pushes the message that made him a giant of
Taiwanese politics: The island will be governed by the will of the
people.
	   ``Our party may be a hundred-year-old shop,'' a smiling Lee told
a rally, ``but it has been re-opened as a modern department store.
You name it and we can provide the service.''
	   Lee will campaign in each of Taiwan's 21 cities and counties at
least twice before the elections, underscoring his influence and
popularity.
	   The president commands great respect for bringing democracy to
Taiwan after coming to power in 1988. His charisma and his folksy
style only embellish his popularity.
	   Lee's Nationalists go into the election after a humiliating
defeat in local elections last December due largely to the party's
corrupt image. But they are expected to retain their slim majority
in a legislature being expanded to 225 seats.
	   Whatever the election outcome may be, Lee can rest assured the
causes he has championed _ democracy and the assertion of a
Taiwanese identity _ have taken hold in Taiwan despite stirring
anger in China.
	   ``These causes are reaffirmed again and again through
elections,'' said Antonio Chiang, publisher of the Taiwan Daily
News. ``Whoever succeeds Lee can only follow the tracks that he has
laid down.''
	   Lee managed to peacefully end the rule of Taiwan's Chinese
elite, which are dominated by the family of Chiang Kai-shek, who
fled China in 1949 after losing a civil war against the communists.
	   As Taiwan's first native-born leader, Lee has given Taiwanese a
say in their own affairs while Chiang had sought to impose a
mainland identity to reinforce his government's claim to represent
all of China.
	   Lee's other campaign to raise the island's international profile
has also angered Beijing, almost to the brink of military
confrontation three years ago. Most Taiwanese want to avoid
changing the island's status, and politicians are going along with
that, putting aside their own stances.
	   In the important Taipei mayoral race, Justice Minister Ma
Ying-jeou, the Nationalist challenger who has adamantly supported
unification with China, toned down his position and is campaigning
under the slogan of ``Taiwan First, Taipei First.''
	   Likewise, incumbent Mayor Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic
Progressive Party has said only that the people will be Taiwan's
ultimate masters, rather than spelling out the party's platform of
independence, which many Taiwanese fear could incite a Chinese
invasion.

Iraq fails to meet deadline to hand over document to inspectors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq failed to meet a U.N. target date to
hand over a document singled out by U.S. President Bill Clinton
which could help inspectors fill in gaps in Iraq's chemical weapons
program, a U.N. spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler sent a letter to
Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz last Friday asking for the
Iraqi air force account of chemical munitions used from 1983-88
during the Iran-Iraq war to be turned over by Monday.
	   ``We have not received the air force documents,'' said Ewen
Buchanan, spokesman for the U.N. Special Commission known as UNSCOM
which Butler heads.
	   The commission is charged with verifying the destruction of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The U.N. Security Council won't
lift oil sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait
until inspectors report that Baghdad's chemical, biological and
nuclear arms and missiles have been destroyed.
	   Weapons inspectors discovered the handwritten account of
munitions disposed of during the war years in July but weren't
allowed to remove it. The document, compiled by an Iraqi officer,
was sealed and the Iraqis put it in a safe.
	   Clinton singled out the air force document when he announced on
Nov. 15 that the United States would hold off on airstrikes and
give Baghdad a last chance to comply with U.N. resolutions
demanding its disarmament.
	   Two days later, Butler sent the first of several letters to Aziz
seeking papers _ the air force document, personal diaries, official
memos and meeting minutes among others _ in one of the first tests
of Iraq's pledge to resume full cooperation with inspectors.
	   Iraq balked at giving the documents to UNSCOM, saying they
didn't exist or had no bearing on Butler's disarmament work. It
also repeated conditions Iraq placed on viewing the air force
document _ that ``relevant portions'' could only be seen in the
presence of U.N. special envoy to Iraq Prakash Shah.
	   Butler on Friday again asked Aziz to hand over the air force
document to U.N. weapons inspectors in Baghdad by Monday, noting
that the Security Council supported his request for documents.
	   Iraq has agreed with several requests from Butler that it deems
legitimate in UNSCOM's quest for a declaration of its disarmament.
But Baghdad has continued to defy UNSCOM on issues it feels it has
already answered or are outside the mandate of U.N. inspectors.
	   Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon argued that forcing Baghdad
to open its archives might jeopardize ``the national security of
Iraq.''
	   Iraq has used the sovereignty argument before in trying to keep
inspectors at bay, and its sympathizers on the Security Council _
particularly Russia, China and France _ have generally supported
the position.
	   Butler was flying to Paris on Tuesday night at the invitation of
the French government and was expected to have a series of talks
there on Wednesday, Buchanan said.
	   On Thursday, Butler flies to Moscow at the invitation of the
Russian government and was expected to have meetings Friday at the
Foreign Ministry, the spokesman said.
	   Iraq's compliance with the weapons inspectors is expected to be
high on the agenda.
	   Butler must inform the Security Council whether Iraq has resumed
full cooperation with UNSCOM before the council can launch a
comprehensive review of Baghdad's compliance with council
resolutions. He said he expects to make a determination in the next
few weeks.
	   The Iraqi government is hoping the review will lead to a quick
lifting of sanctions _ but the United States insists there is no
link.
	   The United Nations, meanwhile, announced Tuesday that a U.N.
committee had approved 10 contracts for Iraqi oil to be delivered
over the next six months. They represent the first contracts
approved since Iraq agreed last week to continue working with the
the U.N. oil-for-food program, which lets Baghdad sell limited
amounts of oil to finance food and medicine for its people.

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia, (AP) _ Police issued a nationwide postal
alert after finding 21 more parcel bombs at a Canberra mail
processing center where a bomb exploded early Wednesday morning.
	   A postal worker was slightly injured by shrapnel when a package
detonated. A search of the building found 21 more bombs.
	   Australian Federal Police said an identical parcel bomb was
discovered in Sydney on Tuesday, taking to 23 in all the number of
bombs found so far.
	   The Sydney parcel was detonated by bomb squad police after the
person to whom it was delivered became suspicious.
	   Federal Police Superintendent Geoff Hazel said the bomber
targeted a specific segment of the community but he declined to
identify it publicly for fear of compromising the investigation.
	   The parcels are white and similar in size to a computer disc
storage box, bearing a 2-dollar stamp and a 30-cent stamp.

Palmeiro returning to Rangers

<TEXT>
	   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) _ Rafael Palmeiro is coming back to Texas.
	   The free agent first baseman and the Rangers agreed to a dlrs 45
million, five-year contract on Tuesday, five years after Texas
signed Will Clark and let Palmeiro go to Baltimore.
	   Palmeiro, who played for Texas from 1989-93, was a fan favorite
in during his first stint in Arlington.
	   Palmeiro, who had just finished his best season in Texas with a
.295 average, 37 homers and 105 RBIs, flourished with the Orioles.
He hit .296 this year with 43 homers and 121 RBIs, leading
Baltimore in homers, hits (183) and RBIs.
	   His return to Texas gives the Rangers something they have sorely
lacked _ power from the left side of the plate. Palmeiro will be
able to take advantage of the short left-field porch at The
Ballpark.
	   Baltimore had been eager to bring Palmeiro back. The Orioles,
who signed Albert Belle to a dlrs 65 million, five-year contract
Tuesday, also have lost Roberto Alomar, Eric Davis and Alan Mills
to free agency.

Lack of international aid makes frigid Afghan winter even worse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Tightly wrapped against the cold that
seeps through the damp walls of Kabul's children's hospital,
4-month-old Aminullah struggles to survive.
	   Doctors say the malnourished boy, who is barely the size of a
newborn, has little chance of making it through the frigid Afghan
winter, when temperatures sink well below freezing.
	   The winter will be much harder this year after international aid
groups pulled out of the capital city rather than follow rules
imposed by the Taliban religious army.
	   ``I don't know what to do. ... He is so hungry,'' says
Aminullah's mother, Huzra, as she rocks him gently back and forth
at the Indira Gandhi Hospital, a multi-story cement building where
the wind whistles through the cold hallways.
	   The hospital has few supplies. The pharmacy is bare. The only
ambulance has been locked away on the compound of one of the many
aid groups that left the city earlier this year.
	   After two decades of war in Afghanistan, Kabul is a desperate
city. Entire neighborhoods lie in ruin. Food stalls in the market
are often full, but too expensive for the poorest.
	   The glucose drip attached to Aminullah's hand was bought in the
market and the dirty woolen blanket Huzra pulls tightly around her
shoulders was brought from her home in the ruins of Kabul.
	   In front of the Ministry of Public Health, workers load about a
dozen pieces of firewood onto a battered steel food trolley and
push it a little over a mile (two kilometers) to the children's
hospital.
	   ``Every day the children are complaining that they are cold ...
but we have no fuel, no wood, nothing,'' says hospital
administrator Maulvi Hajji Nasruddin. ``We have no way to get
anything. ... We have only God.''
	   In July, dozens of aid groups pulled out of Kabul to protest a
Taliban order forcing them to relocate to abandon school
dormitories.
	   Negotiations are currently underway for some to return. At least
15 groups are expected to come back in the coming months, still a
significant drop from the more than 40 that once worked in the
capital.
	   The United Nations is waiting for security guarantees and a
promise of cooperation from the Taliban before allowing its
international staff to return. The United Nations has complained of
interference since the religious army took Kabul in September 1996.
	   The group controls 90 percent of the country, where it has
imposed its strict version of Islamic law.
	   The international Red Cross and the United Nations estimate that
more than 500,000 people in Kabul _ or two-thirds of the city _
depend on international aid to survive.
	   One vital service that continued despite the aid groups' pullout
was a program of bakeries throughout the capital that provides
subsidized bread to the poorest.
	   For some, the bakeries run by the World Food Program, the Red
Cross and CARE International supply their only food other than
heavily sugared tea.
	   ``In winter there is a great need. ... This year it will be
worse because assistance is limited. The international agencies are
not here to help,'' said Zia Nasir, field officer for the World
Food Program in Kabul.
	   For women like Raeza, whose husband was killed when a rocket
smashed into their home, the bread is all that is saving her and
her seven children from ruin. For dinner most nights she serves
bread and hot water.
	   ``Sometimes I beg. ... Some families know I am poor and they
bring their old clothes to me,'' says Raeza, who like many Afghans
uses only one name, her barefoot daughter clinging to her blackened
skirt.
	   In the ruins of Kabul, Lailama Afghani clutches her feverish
baby in her arms and slumps to the cold ground, frightened at the
prospect of another winter.
	   Her husband is sick. Her home is a bombed-out hovel in the
middle of a rocket-ruined neighborhood, a victim of the bitter
factional fighting that followed the end of communist rule here in
1992.
	   Against the bitterly cold nights she has only one wool blanket
for warmth.
	   ``Feel my baby. He has a fever but I have no medicine, no money.
What can I do?'' she asks, the burqa she is forced to wear slung
over her head to expose her face.
	   At an orphanage, where 350 children live in an unheated
building, there is no money for blankets or warm clothing. Some of
the smallest children have no shoes. The Red Cross had agreed to
supply the orphanage with wood. The impoverished Taliban government
has nothing to offer.
	   ``This will be the worst winter. ... We have no economy. This
government is like a sick person in the desert,'' said orphanage
director Maulvi Mohammed Asif.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Alan Alda, Harrison Ford and Barbra Streisand
are among the nominees in three new People's Choice Awards
categories in which Internet users will determine the winners.
	   In celebration of its 25th anniversary, the awards added the
categories of ``All-Time Favorite'' stars of television, movies and
music. The nominees in those and 15 other categories were announced
Monday and determined by a national Gallup poll.
	   Nominees in regular categories include ``Dawson's Creek,''
``There's Something About Mary'' and ``Titanic'' co-stars Leonardo
DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.
	   The Jan. 10 awards ceremony will air live on CBS from Pasadena.
	    &UR; ___
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Shirley MacLaine will receive the Golden Bear
award for lifetime achievement at the Berlin film festival,
organizers said Tuesday.
	   Festival director Moritz de Hadeln praised MacLaine's
``extraordinary versatility'' and said she embodies Hollywood
glamour.
	   MacLaine, 64, will receive her award Feb. 18. The 1980 film
``Being There'' will be among MacLaine's films shown at the
festival, which runs from Feb. 10-21.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ American singer Paul Simon can't
testify via video in the fraud trial of anti-apartheid activist
Allan Boesak, a judge has ruled.
	   Simon had said his workload prevented him from traveling to
South Africa, but agreed to testify against Boesak via telephone or
video from New York City.
	   Judge John Foxcroft on Monday ruled against such a hook-up. He
gave no explanation.
	   Simon donated 600,000 rand (dlrs 180,000 at the time) to
Boesak's Foundation for Peace and Justice Charity.
	   A former minister who once headed the World Alliance of Reformed
Churches, Boesak, 52, allegedly stole 1 million rand (dlrs 300,000
at the time) from the foundation.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Chris Ofili, notorious for incorporating lumps of
elephant dung in his paintings, on Tuesday won this year's Turner
Prize, the most high-profile award of the contemporary art year.
	   Ofili, 30, from Manchester, is the first painter to win the
prize for at least 12 years. He mixes hip hop, pornographic and
biblical references in his multi-layered and detailed work, which
incorporates balls of elephant dung in every painting.
	   If they are not stuck to the canvas, the lacquered, fist-sized
balls support each painting's lower edge as they are propped on the
floor.
	   The Turner Prize, open to British artists under 50 exhibiting
during the previous 12 months, carries a 20,000 pound (dlrs 33,000)
cash award.

	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ French rap singer Didier Morvic has
been charged with assault and is to appear in court later this
month after he allegedly attacked a stewardess and broke her nose,
police said Tuesday.
	   Morvic, alias ``Joey Starr'' of the group NTM, was accused of
striking the stewardess in the face early Sunday morning in a hotel
in this southern French town, police said on customary anonymity.
	   The stewardess, whose name and airline were not identified, was
attacked shortly before she was to work on a flight to Paris,
police said. There was no immediate word on what sparked the
attack.
	   The stewardess suffered ``crano-facial trauma with a nasal
fracture,'' forcing her to stay off the job for 12 days, according
to a statement by France's National Airline Pilots Union.
	   The union condemned the incident and said it would join in the
legal action when Staff appears in court Dec. 16.
	   The union also said it would call on its members to refuse to
allow Starr to take a plane in France.
	   NTM, or Nic Ta Mere, France's most controversial rap group, has
already faced legal action for lyrics attacking the police.
	    &UR; ___
	   CAMBRIDGE, England (AP) _ One of Hollywood legend Jimmy
Stewart's Air Force uniforms will go on display at a British air
museum.
	   The uniform, donated by the late actor's family, will be
presented among historic American combat aircraft at the Duxford
Imperial War Museum at Cambridge, the museum said Tuesday.
	   Stewart was already an Oscar-winning star when he flew 20 combat
missions in World War II, based at Tibenham, England, northeast of
London. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the
French Croix de Guerre.
	   He resumed his screen career after the war and made a total of
80 films, the best known of which is the holiday classic, ``It's a
Wonderful Life.''
	   The museum didn't say when the uniform would go on display.

Braves re-sign Otis Nixon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL NEWBERRY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Otis Nixon returned to the Atlanta Braves on
Tuesday, agreeing to a one-year contract that finally gives the
team a true leadoff hitter.
	   The Braves also re-signed shortstop Ozzie Guillen to a two-year
deal, providing depth behind injury-plagued Walt Weiss.
	   Weiss was the Braves' leadoff hitter most of last season,
inheriting the role almost by default after the team failed to
re-sign Kenny Lofton. Weiss started in the All-Star game and had a
.386 on-base percentage, but he lacks speed (only seven stolen
bases), and chronic leg injuries limited him to 96 games.
	   Nixon, an outfielder who played for the Braves from 1991-93, was
still an effective player at age 39. This year, he hit .297 for the
Minnesota Twins _ matching his career high _ and was eighth in the
American League with 37 stolen bases.
	   Nixon was one of the most popular Braves during his three-year
stint in Atlanta, despite a 60-day suspension for cocaine use that
kept him out of the 1991 postseason and the first three weeks of
the '92 season.
	   Before his suspension, he set a modern franchise record with 72
steals and hit .297. He re-signed with the Braves the following
season after becoming a free agent and hit .294 with 41 steals,
sharing playing time in center field with Deion Sanders.
	   The Braves have a crowded outfield, also signing free agent
Brian Jordan last week to go with returnees Ryan Klesko, Andruw
Jones and Gerald Williams.
	   Schuerholz said the signing of Nixon and the emergence of top
prospect George Lombard doesn't necessarily signal another move in
the outfield. Klesko would be the most likely candidate for a
trade, coming off a sub-par season (.274, 18 homers, 70 RBIs) and
scheduled to make dlrs 17 million over the next three years.
	   Guillen, 34, joined the Braves in May after being waived by the
Baltimore Orioles. He revitalized his career, hitting .277 with one
homer and 22 RBIs in 83 games.

Talks to resume Thursday after another payday passes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Locked-out National Basketball Association
players felt another squeeze on their wallets Tuesday before a
glimmer of hope suddenly emerged.
	   Collective bargaining talks, on hold for nearly two weeks, will
resume Thursday in New York with ``everything back on the table,''
deputy commissioner Russ Granik said.
	   Commissioner David Stern and union director Billy Hunter spoke
by telephone and agreed to a session involving the owners' and
players' full negotiating committees _ the first since Nov. 20.
	   ``Billy called David and it was agreed that there are no
deal-killers or other preconditions. Neither side is now committed
to anything, and whatever was put on the table at the last meeting
is now undone,'' Granik said.
	   Talks originally were scheduled to resume last weekend, but the
sides found themselves arguing over what was agreed to in the Nov.
20 session and whether there would be preconditions for a
resumption.
	   Owners are again asking for a 50-50 split and the players are
asking for 60 percent of revenues. Each side had moved three
percentage points in the Nov. 20 meeting.
	   ``We're back where we started,'' Granik said. ``We agree we're
better off meeting than not meeting.''
	   As the lockout moved into its sixth month, players missed their
second payday.
	   For stars like union president Patrick Ewing, who was due to
earn dlrs 18 million this season, that meant another lost dlrs
900,000 check.
	   ``The unprepared players are the ones who are getting hurt,''
said Eric Snow of the Philadelphia 76ers, who should have had about
dlrs 35,000 directly deposited into his bank account. ``If you paid
attention to the threats, you planned ahead and saved more money
than you ever thought you'd have needed.''
	   Snow took his agent's advice and salted away as much of last
season's dlrs 700,000 salary as possible. His pay was supposed go
up to dlrs 840,000 this season, but the length of the lockout means
he'll lose at least one-third of it.
	   Snow figures he can make it another few months before deciding
whether to liquidate some of his investments or take out a loan to
meet his living expenses. Meantime, he's knows he might never
recoup the money he's losing.
	   ``It's a big bite, but you hope the sacrifice is substantially
worth it in the end,'' Snow said. ``You take a hit now and hope it
benefits you later.''
	   Snow's salary is actually small by NBA standards, falling below
the average salary of about dlrs 2.4 million and the median of
about dlrs 1.2 million.
	   Since the season won't start until January at the earliest,
players also will miss checks Dec. 15 and Jan. 1.
	   Of the approximately dlrs 1 billion players were supposed to
earn this season, more than dlrs 300 million has been lost.

Ice resurfacers may pose pollution hazard in rinks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Ice rink spectators may want to think twice
before giving a round of applause to the guy driving the colorful
ice resurfacing machine. His work may be hazardous to their health.
	   A study by Harvard University researchers concludes that
gasoline- and propane-powered ice surfacing machines may produce
hazardous levels of nitrogen dioxide in rinks.
	   It's sort of like running your car in the garage, said Jonathan
I. Levy, one of the researchers. ``If you leave the engine on in
the garage for a period of time, you know that the pollution levels
rise. Obviously, an ice rink is larger ... but it is a similar
idea.''
	   The solution is increased ventilation. ``Basically, ventilation
levels (in ice rinks) tend to be not that high because, if you
bring in too much outside air, you have trouble keeping ice
quality,'' Levy said.
	   The resurfacing machines are best known by their brand names,
such as Zamboni, Olympia and others. They smooth the ice and spread
a film of water that quickly freezes, improving the surface between
periods of hockey games and in the intermissions at ice shows.
	   The increased levels of nitrogen dioxide immediately after the
machines operate have led to reports of respiratory problems
including coughing, tightness of the chest and shortness of breath,
the researchers said.
	   In one case, a group of Minnesota hockey players had breathing
problems a half hour after the ice was resurfaced.
	   ``The jury is out'' as to whether there is long-term damage,
Levy said. His research was reported in the December edition of the
American Journal of Public Health.
	   There is some evidence that chronic exposure to high levels of
nitrogen dioxide leads to a greater risk of respiratory infection
in children and worsens asthma symptoms,'' Levy said in an
interview.
	   The researchers studied 19 ice rinks in the Boston area for
three years and found that rinks with propane-powered ice
resurfacing machines had average nitrogen dioxide concentrations of
206 parts per billion. The average was 132 parts per billion for
rinks with gasoline machines and 37 ppb for those with electric
machines.
	   Studies have found increased levels of respiratory illness in
people with chronic exposure to 100 ppb of the gas, the researchers
said.
	   Using electric ice resurfacing machines can also help solve the
problem, but buying a new machine can cost up to dlrs 100,000, Levy
said, so the more practical answer may be better ventilation as
well as making sure the machines are tuned to reduce emissions.

Russian prime minister lobbies IMF chief for more loans

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus
has returned to a Russia that badly wants aid to pay off mounting
debts but has been unwilling to make the tough financial decisions
required to win IMF cash.
	   Camdessus is scheduled to hold broad meetings in Moscow on
Wednesday with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Finance
Minister Mikhail Zadornov, Central Bank chairman Viktor
Gerashchenko and other top Russian officials. The IMF chief met
with Primakov after his arrival Tuesday night.
	   ``I want to get better acquainted with the prime minister,''
Camdessus told reporters. ``I presume we will be having interesting
conversations.''
	   The stakes are high: Russia owes billions of dollars to workers,
pensioners and foreign creditors and wants the IMF to release a
frozen dlrs 22.6 billion bailout loan.
	   But Camdessus' visit is unlikely to produce any breakthroughs
for this cash-starved country.
	   The IMF put the loan on hold after Russia's government,
succumbing to the economic crisis that began in Asia, devalued the
ruble and defaulted on some of its debts in August. The fund is
demanding that Russia come up with a realistic economic recovery
plan before it will free up the loan.
	   Russia, however, has been waiting for the IMF to make the first
move. The government delayed a debate this week on next year's
budget as it struggles to find ways to come up with enough money to
meet expenses.
	   While the Cabinet insisted the delay was not connected with
Camdessus' visit, Russian media have suggested the government put
off action on the budget because it is still hoping for the IMF
loans. The latest budget draft assumes Russia will receive the IMF
money.
	   ``Everyone understands that budget parameters remain vague, and
their clarification depends on Camdessus' visit,'' the business
daily Kommersant said Tuesday.
	   If the Russian government doesn't receive foreign help soon, it
will probably have to start printing money, which would drive up
inflation and further imperil Russia's fragile economy.
	   ``I hope that the IMF would be able to make a decision to
provide aid to Russia that would allow us to avoid
hyperinflation,'' Oleg Sysuyev, a top presidential aide, told a
news conference Tuesday.
	   An IMF mission left town last week saying the government's
revenue forecast for next year was overly optimistic. It also
disapproved of the government's intention to lower taxes and offer
subsidies to ailing industries.
	   Russia has so far received only about dlrs 5 billion of the
bailout package, which also involves the World Bank and the
Japanese government.
	   Sysuyev, meanwhile, reiterated that President Boris Yeltsin will
leave day-to-day management of economic matters to Primakov.
Yeltsin is in the hospital receiving treatment for pneumonia and
will not meet with Camdessus.

Anwar trial disrupted by contempt hearing against lawyer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The trial of jailed politician
Anwar Ibrahim was put on hold Wednesday as the judge turned his
attention to a lawyer who has accused prosecutors of forcing a man
to lie about Anwar's alleged sexual trysts.
	   Manjeet Singh Dhillon, accused of contempt of court, is a lawyer
for Anwar's former tennis partner, Nallakaruppan Solaimalai, who is
being tried for illegal possession of ammunition, a charge that
carries a mandatory death sentence.
	   Nallakaruppan, or Nalla, as he is commonly known, was detained
under the Internal Security Act, before Anwar's Sept. 20 arrest.
	   On Monday, a warrant was issued by the court for Manjeet Singh
after he wrote a letter accusing prosecutors of trying to force
Nalla to enter into a plea bargain by giving false evidence against
Anwar.
	   Authorities say 125 bullets were found in Nalla's house during a
police investigation of allegations published in the book, ``Fifty
Reasons Why Anwar Ibrahim Cannot Become Prime Minister.''
	   In the book, it is alleged that Nalla set up sexual trysts for
Anwar while the 51-year-old politician was still deputy prime
minister and heir apparent to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Proceedings against Nalla are separate from Anwar's trial for
four counts of abuse of office. Anwar will face trial later for one
more charge of corruption and five counts of illegal sex acts.
	   Both Anwar and Nalla deny the charges against them.
	   Manjeet Singh's letter formed the basis for an affidavit for
which Zainur Zakaria, a prominent lawyer on Anwar's defense team,
has been sentenced to three months in jail for maligning the
prosecutors. Zainur will go to jail if he loses an appeal Friday.
	   The proceedings against Zainur and Manjeet Singh, both eminent
Malaysian lawyers and former presidents of the bar council, have
stunned the legal community. But there has been no public comment
from the council, the association of attorneys.
	   Anwar's trial began Nov. 4, but was adjourned during a summit
last month of Pacific Rim leaders held in Kuala Lumpur.

Kenyans seek to fight high-level corruption
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHEGE MBITIRU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Corruption is so refined in Kenya that no
one noticed for a good while that police headquarters was paying
salaries to dead officers.
	   ``People have been fiddling with the computers, and a lot of
money has been lost,'' said Noah arap Too, director of the Criminal
Investigation Department. ``Investigations are going on.''
	   Too would not say when the scam was detected, but the East
African Standard reported Nov. 12 that the scheme had begun in 1993
and cost taxpayers 180 million Kenyan shillings, or about dlrs 3
million.
	   On the same day, a committee headed by Judge Richard Kwach
issued a report detailing widespread corruption in the judiciary,
ranging from kickbacks on fines to sexual harassment of defendants.
	   ``Corruption is endemic. It is everywhere. Almost everybody in
Kenya participates in, is affected by, or is a victim of
corruption,'' said Musikari Kombo, chairman of a parliamentary
anti-corruption committee.
	   It is rare to find politicians and civil servants who don't
demand bribes ranging from a few shillings to millions _ payments
commonly referred to as ``kitu kidogo,'' or ``something small'' in
Swahili.
	   Contractors and businessmen pay huge bribes to win government
contracts. Police officers routinely accept bribes to let offenders
go and magistrates can be paid off to set criminals free.
	   Last May, Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae announced the
government was broke and said a major reason was customs officials
taking bribes not to collect duties on imported goods.
	   An even more harmful and rampant form of corruption is the
looting of public property, including land and government
corporations, the private Institute of Economic Affairs says. That
graft is the preserve of the political elite and their cronies, it
adds.
	   For decades, the auditor-general's office has chronicled
misappropriation of funds or outright theft by senior government
officials, but prosecutions have been rare.
	   In 1996, Transparency International, a Berlin-based group that
keeps tabs on government corruption around the world, ranked Kenya
third behind Nigeria and Pakistan.
	   This year, Kenya ranked 11th of 85 countries perceived to be
corrupt.
	   John Githongo, an influential newspaper columnist, warned his
readers not to believe things are getting better in Kenya. The
country's seeming improvement was solely because the watchdog group
had added more countries to its survey, he said.
	   The cost of official corruption can be high.
	   In just one instance, the Finance Ministry paid 5.2 billion
shillings (dlrs 83 million) to Goldenberg International in 1991 as
export subsidies on gold and diamonds that were never exported.
Kenya produces negligible quantities of gold and no diamonds.
	   Since coming to power in 1978, President Daniel arap Moi has
regularly promised to tackle corruption.
	   But donor nations and international lenders, which provide
financial assistance crucial to Kenya's development, have not been
impressed with his efforts, particularly in the Goldenberg case.
	   The International Monetary Fund acted first in August 1997,
suspending a dlrs 220 million loan because, it said, Kenya's
government refused to tackle high-level corruption. The loss of
funds worsened a recession.
	   David Frost, the head of the Chamber of Commerce in Birmingham,
England, said corruption is making foreign investors avoid Kenya.
``Who would risk plunging into a river full of crocodiles?'' he
said.
	   The situation is so bad that two dozen frustrated professionals,
businessmen, bankers, World Bank representatives, religious leaders
and legislators met recently to discuss what could be done about
corruption.
	   ``The scams are known. Figures are there, and yet nothing
happens,'' says Ian Knapp, an official at the World Bank.
	   The Institute of Economic Affairs says most Kenyans believe
nothing happens because of the common denominator in corruption _
``big money and high-ranking personnel.''
	   Charles Gardner, chairman of the East Africa Association, a
group of British businessmen, says graft won't end without a
crackdown on offenders. ``The only way we can deter the crooks is
if they see other crooks being put inside and believe that it might
happen to them,'' he says.
	   But Mohamed Galgalo, a member of the parliamentary
anti-corruption committee, says the solution must come from the
top.
	   ``We must have good will from the government to enforce laws on
corruption,'' Galgalo says. ``This should be the campaign for all
of us.''

Papua New Guinea blackouts continue for second day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Electrical workers have
imposed power blackouts across the country for the second day in a
row as a national strike by trade unions to protest the
government's 1999 budget continues.
	   The strike, which was called by trade union members last Friday
in defiance of Papua New Guinea Trade Union Congress leaders, began
with only intermittent industrial action but appears to be
gathering momentum.
	   About 1,300 workers employed by Papua New Guinea's main power
supplier, Elcom, have cut power to all residences and businesses
throughout the country from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
	   Elcom National Staff Association general secretary Philip Kaira
said the blackouts may be reviewed and the power unions may change
their strategy.
	   ``Now we may just focus on government bodies who have a huge
outstanding debts to Elcom,'' Kaira said.
	   ``We may shift our strategy and hit (cut off power to) all those
customers who owe large sums of money to Elcom in unpaid bills.''
	   Kaira said the unions may disconnect power supplies to
government buildings and offices, including Parliament House in
Port Moresby.
	   The unions have called for Prime Minister Bill Skate's
government to redraft its budget, which slashes spending across
most government departments, axes 7,000 public service jobs and
abolishes key research institutions.
	   Skate has refused to redraft the budget and claims that the
national strike is not based on industrial issues but is
politically motivated and illegal.

Job prospects dimming for Japan's high school graduates
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY317-318 &QL; 
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nobuyuki Asai had pretty much expected he would get
a job offer from Japan's biggest telecommunications company before
his high school graduation next spring.
	   Although not a stellar student, Asai had reason to be
optimistic. In the past, every senior at Adachi High who wanted a
job had found one by mid-September.
	   The offer never came. Of the nearly 50 Adachi students looking
for work this year, six are still searching and 10 have given up
and decided to go to vocational schools.
	   With Japan's economy wilting, a growing legion of disillusioned
teen-agers is finding the country's work force has no room for them
_ spawning fears that if things don't improve, Japan could soon be
paying the price in increased crime and poverty.
	   Unemployment for young Japanese between 15- and 19-years-old is
about 10 percent, the highest since the government began tracking
the figure in 1968 and far above the 4.3 percent rate for the
general population.
	   It is better than the United States, where the teen jobless rate
is about 15 percent. But near zero unemployment has long been one
of the pillars of Japan's postwar economic growth, and a key to the
low crime rates and social stability Japanese have grown accustomed
to.
	   ``It's a state of emergency,'' said Ryo Mino, an official in the
Education Ministry. ``We are extremely worried.''
	   Education officials say a major concern is a growing
rootlessness among teens who no longer desire the job security and
social standing that are so important to their parents. Many
instead float from one part-time job to another.
	   Juvenile crime _ although low compared to the United States and
other Western nations _ has been rising. The number of juveniles
committing murder, rape and other serious crimes jumped to 2,263 in
1997, up 51 percent from the year before. The number rose an
additional 10 percent during the first half of this year.
	   Disillusionment and restlessness are particularly high among
teens who aren't on track to get into the best universities.
	   Adachi High _ a drab, gray school on the slummy side of Tokyo,
where railroad tracks crisscross a muddy river _ sends few of its
graduates to the top four-year colleges.
	   Instead, most of the students, typical teens with a weakness for
baggy jeans and karaoke parties, end up in less prestigious
colleges or trade schools.
	   But not until this year did the possibility of being left out in
the cold become a reality.
	   Job offers for prospective high school graduates in the district
plummeted 35 percent. The drop was especially drastic in the ailing
financial sector, where offers fell from 52 to just nine.
	   With the recession worsening, salesclerk jobs that previously
went to high school graduates are being snatched up by those with
university and junior college degrees.
	   Such economic changes are hard for today's youth to grasp.
	   ``These kids grew up in affluence,'' said Kokichi Arai, a
guidance counselor at Adachi High. ``Their parents gave them money
and lots of material things. They think jobs are easy to come by.''
	   Kazuyuki Kageyama of the unemployment office for the Adachi
district said youngsters are starting to simply give up.
	   Over the last three years, seniors in the Adachi district with
no interest in either going to college or finding full-time
employment have more than doubled. Most of them end up with
part-time jobs.
	   ``Fortunately, there are still lots of part-time jobs for these
kids,'' Kageyama said. ``But I fear what the future holds could be
dangerous.''
	   Asai, a cheerful 17-year-old who plays the tuba for his
award-winning high school band, had once hoped to go to college.
But when his father's demolition business failed several years ago
_ a casualty of the recession _ Asai realized he'd have to let that
dream go.
	   Then the hoped-for telecommunications job didn't materialize.	   Finally, his guidance counselor found Asai a spot at a small
computer firm run by an Adachi graduate.
	   ``It was like there was no chance for us from the beginning,''
Asai said. ``Having just a high school degree was a big drawback.''

Businessmen, unions unite on literacy drive in Brazil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAROLD OLMOS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIBEIRAO PIRES, Brazil (AP) _ Rosalvo Amaral's job prospects
usually died when he showed his identity card. In place of his
signature was a word he couldn't understand: illiterate.
	   Francois Courtes, a French-born industrialist, needed skilled
workers to improve quality at his strongbox factory in this Sao
Paulo suburb. He was alarmed to learn nine of his 46 employees
couldn't read or write.
	   Their common need brought them together. Today, Amaral is among
20 adults studying their alphabet at a course in Courtes' factory.
	   As Brazil painfully emerges from decades of market protections
to compete in the global economy, illiteracy remains a major
obstacle. Two-thirds of the work force _ nearly 50 million
Brazilians _ dropped out before finishing high school.
	   The Sao Paulo Trade Federation says Brazilian workers spend on
average less than four years in school, compared to 11 years in
South Korea, nearly nine in Argentina and 7 1/2 in Chile. Poor
education often means poorer quality for Brazilian goods and a
smaller chance for companies to compete in world markets.
	   As those markets shrink in a global economic crisis, Brazilians
are learning that only the best will survive. And an unlikely
alliance of unions and big business has emerged to try to improve
labor and product.
	   In Ribeirao Pires and other industrial suburbs ringing Sao
Paulo, South America's biggest city, hundreds of adults are
enrolled in literacy classes offered by factories and private
businesses.
	   The project was proposed by the powerful Union of Metal Workers
_ and signaled an about-face in the confrontational tactics long
used by labor.
	   Union leader Luiz Marinho knows both approaches. Twenty years
ago, at age 15, he fought at street barricades in labor protests.
Today he sits down with business executives, politicians and
bankers, discussing ways to improve the quality of life.
	   ``We now look at the entire society,'' Marinho said. ``We look
for comprehensive solutions to the most pressing problems, from
reinforcing river banks to building clinics.''
	   One result of cooperation is a dramatic decrease in strikes.
Last year, there were just four strikes in Sao Paulo's industrial
belt, compared to 850 in 1978.
	   Better education also is an essential part of the cooperative
atmosphere.
	   ``We have to make the region attractive to private
investments,'' Marinho said. ``They will choose places with good
road networks, with good public utilities, where levels of
education are high.''
	   For unions, the bottom line is jobs.
	   Unemployment has soared since 1994, as Brazil wrestled inflation
down from 50 percent a month to under 4 percent a year. Officially,
the jobless rate is 8.2 percent, the worst in 15 years. But unions
say the rate is really around 20 percent.
	   Everyone agrees it will get worse. After local financial markets
tumbled and foreign investors pulled back from Brazil in August,
the government ratcheted interest rates up to nearly 50 percent and
promised to cut spending. For Latin America's biggest economy the
prognosis is stagnant growth or recession.
	   The auto industry, a big employer, has felt the pinch. After
production last year hit a record 2 million vehicles, sales have
slumped. In September, the local plants of Ford Motor Co. and
General Motors Corp. announced they will idle thousands of workers.
	   For industry, the goal of the literacy classes is to raise
quality and competitiveness.
	   Courtes, the factory owner, saw his plans to obtain a quality
certificate for his plant stymied by uneducated employees. ``Some
workers couldn't read the instructions or fill out forms,'' he
said.
	   He has high hopes for the literacy campaign, which gives
students the equivalent of a fourth-grade education. A
	   ``People feel better and happier,'' Courtes said. ``This helps a
lot in the production process.''
	   Evandro Salero, manager at the Irmaos Correia bus company, also
noticed a dramatic change in his workers after he started a
literacy program.
	   ``In just weeks they were more confident and spoke up their
minds articulately,'' he said. ``Look at them now. They want to
continue; they want to go further.''
	   Amaral, the student at Courtes' plant, is hoping to get a leg up
in the job competition.
	   ``Maybe I'll be ready to learn a profession,'' he said. ``At
least, things may change and I will find a stable job again.''
	   But already, his world is changing.
	   ``I didn't know how good it feels to see those letters and
discover they form meanings,'' he said.

Mets, Dodgers and Orioles in 3-way trade, Palmeiro to Texas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Another wild day in U.S. baseball's offseason
marketplace left half a dozen big names on new teams.
	   After Rafael Palmeiro went back to Texas, Otis Nixon returned to
Atlanta and Albert Belle formalized his deal with Baltimore, the
New York Mets, Los Angeles Dodgers and Orioles pulled off a
surprising three-way trade, The Associated Press learned.
	   When the wheel stopped spinning Tuesday night, New York had
acquired outfielder Roger Cedeno from the Dodgers and reliever
Armando Benitez from the Orioles, Baltimore got catcher Charles
Johnson and Los Angeles wound up with catcher Todd Hundley and
minor league pitcher Arnold Gooch.
	   The big money deals (Palmeiro dlrs 45 million for five years)
and Belle (dlrs 65 million for five years), were overshadowed by
the big three-way trade, a rarity in baseball's free-agent era.
	   First, the Mets sent Hundley and Gooch to the Dodgers for
Johnson and Cedeno, and then they sent Johnson to Baltimore for
Benitez.
	   Hundley, who is to be paid dlrs 5.2 million next season and dlrs
6 million in 2000, became expendable after New York re-signed Mike
Piazza to a dlrs 91 million, seven-year deal in October.
	   Hundley struggled last season after returning from the disabled
list in July following reconstructive surgery on his right elbow at
the end of the 1997 season.
	   He hit just .161 with three homers, 12 RBIs and 55 strikeouts in
124 at-bats, limiting his trade value. Before the injury, Hundley
was one of the most feared hitters in the league.
	   Hundley, a 29-year-old switch-hitter, set a big-league record
for homers by a catcher in 1996, hitting 41 to surpass Roy
Campanella's 43-year-old standard. Hundley also hit .259 and drove
in 112 runs that year.
	   Benitez gives the Mets added depth in their bullpen. He went 5-6
with a 3.82 ERA and 22 saves last season for Baltimore. He will
most likely be the right-handed setup man for closer John Franco.
	   Johnson, 27, came to the Dodgers along with Gary Sheffield,
Bobby Bonilla, Jim Eisenreich and a minor league pitcher for Piazza
and third baseman Todd Zeile last May 15. Piazza was traded to the
Mets a week later.
	   Johnson played in 133 games with the Marlins and Dodgers last
season and hit just .218 with 19 homers and 58 RBIs.
	   The 24-year-old Cedeno, a switch hitter long considered a top
prospect, played in 105 games for the Dodgers last season and hit
.242 with two homers and 17 RBIs.

Australia defies Asian crisis to chalk up 5 percent growth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia has defied the Asian
economic crisis and recorded spectacular economic growth of 5
percent, according to figures released Wednesday.
	   Australia's gross domestic product rose 1 percent in the three
months to September 30 from the previous three months, and rose 5
percent year-on-year, the Australian Bureau of Statistics
announced.
	   News of the growth came just hours after the country's central
Reserve Bank cut official interest rates by 0.25 percentage points,
to 4.75 percent.
	   Treasurer Peter Costello said the growth figures demonstrated
the resilience of the Australian economy.
	   ``I want to pay tribute to Australia's exporters who have done a
remarkable job,'' Costello said.
	   Before the Asian economic crisis, which started in July last
year, almost 70 percent of Australia's exports went to Asian
markets.
	   Since then, local exporters have found new markets in Europe and
North America.
	   Costello said currency realignments, including a weaker
Australian dollar, had helped.
	   He said another 5 percent economic growth rate was not expected
in the year ahead.
	   Australia's growth had been fueled by strong exports, high
private capital spending and vigorous domestic spending, the bureau
reported.
	   Australia had done well in the first year of the Asian crisis,
Costello said.
	   ``To have weathered the first year with such exceptional
strength in the economy has been a major achievement,'' he said.

Dodgers acquire Hundley from Mets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN NADEL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The Los Angeles Dodgers, looking to beef up
their offense, acquired power-hitting catcher Todd Hundley from the
New York Mets on Tuesday for catcher Charles Johnson and outfielder
Roger Cedeno, The Associated Press learned.
	   The Dodgers will also receive minor league pitcher Arnie Gooch,
a 22-year-old right-hander obtained by the Mets in the Bret
Saberhagen trade on July 31, 1995.
	   Los Angeles wouldn't immediately confirm the trade, but planned
to make the announcement later Tuesday night.
	   Hundley, coming off elbow surgery, played in just 53 games last
season and hit .161 with three homers and 12 RBIs. He became
expendable when the Mets signed catcher Mike Piazza to a dlrs 91
million, seven-year contract earlier in the offseason.
	   Hundley, a 29-year-old switch-hitter, set a big-league record
for homers by a catcher in 1996, hitting 41 to surpass Roy
Campanella's 43-year-old standard. Hundley also hit .259 and drove
in 112 runs that year.
	   Hampered by elbow problems in 1997, Hundley played in 132 games
and hit .273 with 30 homers and 86 RBIs. He thus became the first
Mets player to hit 30 or more homers in consecutive seasons since
Darryl Strawberry did so in 1987-88.
	   Johnson, 27, came to the Dodgers along with Gary Sheffield,
Bobby Bonilla, Jim Eisenreich and a minor league pitcher for Piazza
and third baseman Todd Zeile last May 15. Piazza was traded to the
Mets a week later.
	   Johnson played in 133 games with the Marlins and Dodgers last
season and hit just .218 with 19 homers and 58 RBIs. He was
immediately traded by the Mets to the Baltimore Orioles for
reliever Armando Benitez, a deal that made sense due to Piazza's
presence.
	   The 24-year-old Cedeno, a switch hitter long considered a top
prospect, played in 105 games for the Dodgers last season and hit
.242 with two homers and 17 RBIs.

Palmeiro returning to Rangers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details &QL; 
 &UR; By SUSAN MONTOYA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) _ Rafael Palmeiro is coming back to Texas.
	   The free agent first baseman and the Rangers agreed to a dlrs 45
million, five-year contract on Tuesday, five years after Texas
signed Will Clark and let Palmeiro go to Baltimore.
	   Palmeiro, who played for Texas from 1989-93, was a fan favorite
during his first stint in Arlington.
	   But he was finished in Texas the day Clark signed a five-year,
dlrs 30 million deal with the Rangers. Palmeiro ended up getting an
almost identical deal in Baltimore.
	   His departure was a bitter one, with Palmeiro criticizing the
Rangers' desire to win a World Series and telling a newspaper that
Clark, a teammate at Mississippi State, had undercut him.
	   ``That's Will,'' Palmeiro told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram at
the time. ``That's the way he is. He's got no class. Friendship
didn't matter to him. ... He's a low-life.''
	   Palmeiro also blasted Rangers management, including President
Tom Scheiffer, who remains with the team.
	   Palmeiro, who had just finished his best season in Texas with a
.295 average, 37 homers and 105 RBIs, flourished with the Orioles,
and he always seemed to punish Texas pitchers. He hit .296 this
year with 43 homers and 121 RBIs, leading Baltimore in homers, hits
(183) and RBIs.
	   His return to Texas gives the Rangers something they have sorely
lacked _ power from the left side of the plate. Palmeiro will be
able to take advantage of the short right-field porch at The
Ballpark, something Clark rarely seemed able to do here.
	   This time, it's Clark's turn to look for another team.
	   ``We had initial interest from a number of teams, but we had
focused our attention on Texas, which was Will's first choice,''
said Clark's agent, Jeff Moorad. ``At this point, we'll go back to
the other teams that have expressed interest and continue this game
of musical chairs.''
	   While Moorad wouldn't say what teams he has talked to, the
Boston Red Sox and Orioles are said to be interested in Clark.
	   Palmeiro, according to a pair of baseball sources, turned down a
dlrs 50 million, five-year offer from Baltimore, agreeing to a
contract that calls for yearly salaries of dlrs 9 million,
including dlrs 1 million per season deferred.
	   Baltimore had been eager to bring Palmeiro back. The Orioles,
who signed Albert Belle to a dlrs 65 million, five-year contract
Tuesday, also have lost Roberto Alomar, Eric Davis and Alan Mills
to free agency.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ When Thailand's economic bubble burst,
once-successful property developer Patcha Punprom found herself in
the position of many Thais _ dreams shattered and facing
bankruptcy.
	   One night, haunted by unpaid bills, she overdosed on sleeping
pills. Her mother saved her and put her in touch with a suicide hot
line.
	   ``I am broke and cannot afford my bills,'' Patcha, 28, told a
worker at the hot line. ``All the time, I want to die, because it
will end my problems.''
	   Patcha isn't alone in her despair. Thailand's economic collapse
last year is being blamed for the doubling of the suicide rate, a
frightening development in a country renowned for an easygoing
attitude toward life and where everything seemed to be getting
better during the go-go early 1990s.
	   Take the case of a would-be engineer who jumped from a
12th-story apartment in the middle of Bangkok last weekend. He left
behind puzzled parents who can hardly understand how it happened to
their family.
	   They told police that their son was under heavy stress after a
year of fruitless job-hunting. As a postgraduate student, he had
high hopes for his future and could not accept being unemployed.
	   He was one of 2 million Thais that the recession, the worst in
decades, has left jobless. Health authorities credit it with
feeding rising drug abuse, violence and suicides.
	   ``Spreading stress and despair have triggered an alarming rise
in suicide and violence, especially among men, who are the
traditional breadwinners,'' said Somchai Chakrabhand, deputy
director general of the Department of Mental Health.
	   The main reasons for suicide used to be a broken heart, chronic
mental problems or disappointment related to home and school,
Somchai said. All those troubles still exist, now joined by
recession.
	   Two suicides are reported each day in the Thai capital _ usually
by poisoning, shooting, hanging or leaping from a building, Somchai
said.
	   Last month, a 62-year-old farmer hanged himself from a tree
outside Government House, where Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and
his Cabinet work, after months of quiet protest.
	   Debt-stricken Chum Sakhorn took his life to protest the
government's indifference in helping him recover his farm from what
he considered unscrupulous businessman and corrupt bureaucrats. The
suicide became an embarrassing political issue, then blew over.
	   A total of 560 suicides were recorded in Thailand between July
1997, when the economic crisis began, and June _ double that of
previous years. Somchai estimates the financial crisis was behind
24 percent of the deaths. Three-quarters of the victims were men.
	   Heavy publicity given suicides seems to be prompting more people
to kill themselves. Endlessly repeated television footage of a
suicidal woman who fell to her death from a rooftop during a
bungled rescue bid was followed by four similar suicide attempts
the next day.
	   The account of a debt-ridden nurse who forced her 8-year-old son
to take insecticide before strangling herself received wide media
coverage.
	   Within hours, Bangkok police recorded three more suicides, all
men who were caught up in job and financial troubles. One jumped in
front of a train, another leaped from a five-story building and a
third threw himself to a busy street from a pedestrian overpass.
	   Hundreds of hot lines have been set up at government hospitals
and health centers. The Mental Health Department has urged the
media to be more sensitive in reporting suicide.
	   The department and police have been discussing the formation of
special units to deal with suicide threats. Each unit would be made
up of psychologists, police, fire fighters and paramedics.

Companies close checkbooks in protest against Suriname's exchange
</HEADLINE>
rate &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ Delivering a major economic blow to
Suriname's government, two aluminum mining companies stopped paying
taxes and exchanging their dollars through the national bank.
	   The Suriname Aluminum Co., a branch of Pittsburgh-based Aluminum
Company of America, and the Suriname Billiton Bauxite Co. claim the
government cheated them out of dlrs 17 million over the last 14
months by buying their U.S. currency for half what it is worth.
	   They said Tuesday they would only convert enough money to meet
their payroll of about 3,000 people.
	   Suriname, a Dutch-speaking country in South America, exports
bauxite and finished aluminum worth dlrs 359 million annually. The
exports are the largest source of hard currency for the country _
the Western Hemisphere's second-poorest after Haiti.
	   Under Surinamese law, the two companies must change their
foreign exchange earnings to Surinamese guilders through the
Suriname Central Bank.
	   The service charge for the exchange is one of the largest
sources of income for the government. Suriname Aluminum Co. alone
exchanged about dlrs 2 million per month through the bank.
	   But the official exchange rate set by the bank is 396 guilders
to the U.S. dollar, while street prices hover around dlrs 700 to
the dollar.
	   Natural resources minister Errol Alibux said he had called a
meeting with leaders of the two companies to discuss the protest.
	   Suriname has been wracked by unrest linked to rising inflation
despite efforts to control the exchange rate. A new sales tax,
imposed just before Christmas last year, outraged workers.
Government employees are currently in their fourth week of a strike
to demand raises.

Thomson takes the heat for course revamp
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DENNIS PASSA
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ As Australian golf's father figure,
Peter Thomson seemed a natural to captain the Down Under-dominated
International team at next week's Presidents Cup at Royal
Melbourne.
	   But this week, five-time British Open winner Thomson is taking
the heat from a number of golfers at the Australian Open, including
Presidents Cup player Stuart Appleby of Australia, over Thomson's
design changes to Royal Adelaide.
	   ``I expected there will be controversy,'' Thomson said Wednesday
as Greg Norman, playing his first 72-hole tournament since
undergoing shoulder surgery eight months ago, toured Royal Adelaide
in advance of Thursday's opening round.
	   Thomson has added about 300 meters to the now par-72,
6,565-meter (7,178-yard) course, grown out the rough and extended
it further into the fairways and added 20 bunkers. Royal Adelaide's
small greens have been left, well, small.
	   Norman was reserved in his comments on the course, but his body
language during Tuesday's pro-am indicated he wasn't happy. He
appeared to be upset when after finishing pin-high down the left
side of the green on the short par-4 third, he found his ball
submerged in knee-high rough and could only blast it into similar
territory on the other side.
	   ``Where do you play to?'' he was heard to murmur to his caddie,
Tony Navarro.
	   Appleby said he would have preferred that the course was left
the way it was.
	   ``I don't know what was wrong with it,'' said Appleby. ``There
is a real fine line between pleasure and pain. You are going to see
some pretty ugly shots.
	   ``We are now hitting four irons where we used to hit seven irons
into some places,'' added Appleby. ``Shots are longer but we are
talking about green sizes that haven't changed. I've never seen a
course become harder by so much.''
	   Local newspaper reports have one unnamed player suggesting that
Thomson has ``lost his marbles,'' while another is quoted he'll do
the ``full monty'' _ strip naked _ in front of the clubhouse if
anyone in the field breaks par in all four rounds.
	   Thomson won three of his five British Opens at Royal Birkdale,
Royal Lytham and St. Anne's, and he says it's only natural that he
would lean towards seaside links in his course preference.
	   ``I didn't hear anyone complaining about Royal Birkdale, Troon
or Lytham,'' said Thomson. ``That's because it's the British Open
and you expect it. But why shouldn't we expect it at the Australian
Open?''
	   Englishman Nick Faldo isn't complaining _ he said he enjoyed the
traditional touches of Scottish golf architect Alister Mackenzie,
who also designed Augusta National and Royal Melbourne. Thomson has
tipped Faldo, a winner of six majors, as the likely Australian Open
winner.
	   ``It's a fantastic course, naturally challenging and full of
wonderful Mackenzie bunkering,'' Faldo said Wednesday after his
practice round, which he said he played poorly.
	   ``You can be just a yard off the fairway and still have 200 to
the green, but not a chance of reaching it because of the heavy
rough,'' Faldo said. ``It has a way of punishing you, but that's
golf.''
	   Faldo's countryman Lee Westwood won last year's Australian Open
at the Metropolitan course in Melbourne in a playoff with Norman,
who has won the tournament five times. But Westwood isn't back to
defend his title, playing in South Africa instead.
	   U.S. Presidents Cup team members Fred Couples and John Huston
are also in the Australian Open field, along with other
International members Craig Parry of Australia, New Zealand's Frank
Nobilo and Greg Turner and Paraguay's Carlos Franco.
	   Couples and Huston, possible partners in the Presidents Cup,
played a leisurely practice round Wednesday morning. Couples
watched in amazement on the par-4 sixth when gusty winds blew putt
after practice putt away from the hole. (djp)

Report: North Korea preparing another rocket launch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ U.S. spy satellites have detected North Koreans
preparing to launch another missile and Tokyo has been warned, a
Japanese newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The North Koreans have been moving parts of their new Taepo Dong
missile from storage to the launch pad since about Nov. 20, the
Yomiuri newspaper reported, citing Japanese government sources that
had received word from the United States.
	   Japan is worried that the North is likely to launch another
missile later this year, said the Yomiuri, Japan's largest daily,
in a front-page article.
	   Government spokesman Hiromu Nonaka acknowledged Wednesday that
Tokyo was aware of ``some kind of movement'' in North Korea. He
would not elaborate.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi confirmed Japan had received
``various information'' about a North Korean launch in the works,
but Kyodo News agency quoted him as saying, ``I have not heard that
it has been confirmed.''
	   The Defense Agency would not comment on the Yomiuri report.
	   Japanese were unnerved by the firing of a rocket by North Korea
on Aug. 31. Believed to be a test of its Taepo Dong, the rocket
flew over Japan and landed in the Pacific Ocean, proving the
communist nation can strike any part of the country.
	   Japan has a peaceful rocket program but no spy satellite of its
own and must rely on the United States for information about the
threat from North Korean missiles.
	   A joint missile defense system with the United States has been
proposed, and Japan approved a plan to put four spy satellites into
orbit by 2002.
	   North Korea, which says it put a satellite in orbit with the
August firing, has denounced Japan's spy satellite plan, calling it
a ``dangerous military action.''
	   The Radiopress agency in Tokyo, monitoring North Korean reports,
said Korean Central Radio reported Tuesday that the scientists who
worked on the launch were awarded medals.
	   When asked last week about recent reports of more possible North
Korean missile tests, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen declined
comment.

Guerrilla negotiator: We will not lay down our arms

<TEXT>
	   LA MACHACA, Colombia (AP) _ Leftist rebels have no intention of
giving up their weapons even if a peace accord is reached with
President Andres Pastrana's government, a top guerrilla negotiator
said.
	   ``The government knows that we're not going to surrender our
weapons,'' said Joaquin Gomez, one of three subcomandantes
representing the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC,
in a peace dialogue that has yet to begin.
	   ``They are talking with us because we have them, and these same
weapons will be a guarantee afterwards that the agreements are
carried out,'' Gomez, the 51-year-old chief of the rebel's southern
military bloc, told reporters Monday in this remote southern
hamlet.
	   The government has not set any conditions for the talks, though
Pastrana has appealed for a truce, at least through the Christmas
and New Year's holiday. The rebels have refused to halt
hostilities, however.
	   Three soldiers, a police officer and nine civilians were killed
in separate rebel attacks Monday and Tuesday in northwestern
Colombia, authorities said.
	   Accompanied by a dozen bodyguards, Gomez arrived in La Machaca,
which is little more than a cluster of huts along a dirt road,
driving a green Ford sport utility vehicle.
	   Another rebel spokesman, 33-year-old Fabian Ramirez, came in
another vehicle and sported a Che Guevara wristwatch. The
reporters, arriving from the other direction, had to first clear a
rebel checkpoint.
	   Gomez, a former university lecturer, said Pastrana has not
honored his promise to remove all soldiers from a
16,200-square-mile (42,000-square-kilometer) swath of southern
Colombia where the peace talks are to take place. He said there
will be no peace talks until the pullout, now nearly a month
delayed, is complete.
	   Pastrana says the more than 100 soldiers that remain at a
military base in nearby San Vicente del Caguan, the largest town in
the pullout zone, are unarmed and are there to support government
negotiators, a claim rejected by the rebels.
	   The rebel negotiators' next scheduled meeting with Pastrana's
peace commissioner is set for Dec. 11.
	   More than 400 kilometers (250 miles) away, nine civilians and
one police officer were killed in an attack Tuesday by FARC
fighters on a police post in the town of San Francisco, said
Antioquia state police spokesman Haten Dasuki. He could not provide
details on how the civilians died, other than to say that the FARC
used car bombs.
	   In the nearby town of Cocorna, three soldiers were killed in an
ambush by rebels of the National Liberation Army, or ELN, the
country's second-largest guerrilla force, the army said.
	   The soldiers had arrived to help a besieged police post, which a
column of about 100 ELN fighters attacked at 6 p.m. on Monday, said
deputy police commander Gen. Alfredo Salgado. He said seven police
officers were missing and possibly captured.

Virgin Islands leader wants to upgrade U.S. status
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAN PERRY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ Less than two weeks
before Puerto Ricans vote the preference on statehood, the incoming
governor of the neighboring U.S. Virgin Islands says he wants more
rights for his territory _ but not statehood.
	   ``We want the full degree of American freedoms under the U.S.
flag,'' Gov.-elect Charles Turnbull said Tuesday in an interview
with The Associated Press. ``We are American citizens and I think
we should have the right.''
	   He added, however, that he would not seek to become a state, but
would fight for many of the same rights.
	   ``Our delegate in the Congress can't vote on the floor. We would
want that,'' he said. ``We could vote for president and vice
president of the United States. I don't see why we can't do that.''
	   Inhabitants of the islands are now considered U.S. citizens and
have a non-voting representative in Congress. They are not allowed
to participate in U.S. presidential elections.
	   The country is considered an unincorporated territory of the
United States, administered by the Department of the Interior, and
U.S. currency is used. Defense is the responsiblity of the United
States.
	   Turnbull said he would call a constitutional convention which he
hoped would result in a petition for improved status to the United
States, which bought the territory from Denmark in 1917 for
strategic purposes. Four previous conventions ended in deadlock.
	   Turnbull was interviewed during a break between meetings with
U.S. and other business leaders he hoped would invest in the
islands and help them overcome a debt estimated at about dlrs 1
billion _ a monumental sum in a territory of about 114,000 people
	   Turnbull bemoaned the misconception that the territory was
devastated by a series of hurricanes that struck in recent years,
beginning with Hugo in 1989, the first major storm after a
half-century of relative calm, and leading up to September's
Hurricane Georges.
	   ``We intend to market the islands better to attract more
tourists,'' he said.

Prime minister improves his chances of survival with coalition
</HEADLINE>
deal &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT KEITH-REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ Political commentators believe a coalition
deal announced by Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka will greatly
improve his chances of retaining office after a general election
expected to occur in May.
	   Rabuka, leader of the SVT, or Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei,
meaning ``Fijian Political Party,'' which heads the present
government, said Tuesday he had agreed with the National Federated
and United General parties to ``cooperate'' with the aim of setting
up a coalition after the election.
	   The National Federated Party (NFP) is backed by the bulk of the
Indian community that comprises 43 percent of the 800,000
population. It controls two-thirds of Indian communal seats in the
present Parliament and is expected to at least retain that strength
after the May election.
	   The United General Party (UGP) is backed by minority European,
European-Chinese and other small communities and is expected to
emerge from the May election with at least the five seats it has in
the present Parliament.
	   The NFP leader, opposition leader Jai Ram Reddy, is one of the
government ministers ousted and jailed in 1987 when then Col.
Rabuka led a Fijian nationalist coup against a newly elected
Indian-dominated government.
	   Reddy and Rabuka reconciled in recent years and were the key
figures in securing a democratic constitution as a replacement for
one condemned internationally after it imposition by a post coup
regime.
	   Since the new constitution does not guarantee Fijians the
complete political supremacy they had under the former
constitution, Fijian nationalist extremist splinter groups have
emerged with the aim of toppling Rabuka.
	   Local commentators say the splintering of Fijian loyalties, plus
anti-Rabuka parties backed by chiefs who disapprove of Rabuka's
commoner background, present a serious threat to Rabuka in
retaining sufficient Fijian backing for the SVT.
	   The agreement with the NFP and UGP should ensure him at least
25-30 seats in the new 71-seat Parliament in addition to the
numbers he can reasonably hope to pick up for the SVT. No firm date
has been set for the election, but election authorities are
indicating a mid May date, as has Rabuka.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Police issued a nationwide postal
alert after finding 21 more parcel bombs at a Canberra mail
processing center where a bomb exploded early Wednesday morning.
	   A postal worker was slightly injured by shrapnel when a package
detonated. A search of the building found 21 more bombs.
	   Police ruled out a political or diplomatic link to the bombs.
	   Sources close to the investigation said the matter related to a
personal dispute. Staff at the Australian Tax Office were warned
not to open any suspicious packages.
	   Australian Federal Police said an identical parcel bomb was
discovered in Sydney on Tuesday, taking to 23 in all the number of
bombs found so far.
	   The Sydney parcel was detonated by bomb squad police after the
person to whom it was delivered became suspicious.
	   Federal Police Superintendent Geoff Hazel said the bomber
targeted a specific segment of the community but he declined to
identify them publicly for fear of compromising the investigation.
	   The parcels are white and similar in size to a computer disc
storage box, bearing a 2-dollar stamp and a 30-cent stamp.

Star skaters get to improvise their routines
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ There's nothing all those well-programmed figure
skaters like less than ad-libbing. Each of their regimented,
precisely choreographed on-ice practice sessions is designed to
make automatic every spin, every jump, every move.
	   All of which should make Thursday night's Improv-Ice
entertaining and unpredictable.
	   Twelve of the world's most accomplished skaters will compete at
the Centrum in Worcester, Massachusetts, without knowing what
routine they're performing until one hour before they hit the ice.
	   ``I thought, `Wouldn't it be fun to do something that a lot of
clubs do to try to promote individuality and spontaneity from
skaters, and do it with the established stars,'' said Robin
Cousins, the 1980 Olympic champion who came up with the Improv-Ice
format and is producing the event. ``We'll have them go out on a
limb and instantly create.''
	   On hand will be Olympic champions Kristi Yamaguchi and Viktor
Petrenko; U.S. champions Nancy Kerrigan, Rosalynn Sumners, Nicole
Bobek and Rudy Galindo; current world champion Alexei Yagudin;
Philippe Candeloro; Brian Orser; Michael Weiss; Denise Biellmann;
and Surya Bonaly. Each will draw for a starting position one hour
before the event. Then, they will draw a style of music, either
classical, jazz, easy-listening, rock n' roll, theatrical and
country.
	   The skaters then get one hour to listen to the music, with 30
minutes allowed for on-ice rehearsal.
	   ``We have a group of people that some people would not expect
the type of spontaneity we hope they will show,'' Cousins said. ``I
know they all have this ability.
	   ``There were skaters I thought of, and we have most of the
skaters there. They'll all be responsive, such as Philippe
Candeloro, who is wonderfully spontaneous. And musically, we are
not going into the deepest realm of obscurity. It is music a lot of
them will know.''
	   But they won't have skated to it, at least not competitively.
And they won't have much time to come up with a program that fits,
whether it be Tchaikovsky or Aerosmith or Brooks and Dunn.
	   ``There is nothing unskateable,'' said Cousins, who also will
serve as artistic director for Improv-Ice, which will be televised
live by USA Network. ``I didn't pick the music until I knew the 12
skaters. I expect all of them be able to pull something together
for whatever music they get.''
	   The audience also won't know the music a skater selected until
the competition begins and the skater announces it.
	   Cousins is convinced the public needs to see something fresh
from televised skating events. This approach certainly is fresh.
	   ``One of the things I found I like when creating these shows is
doing things that have never been done before,'' he said. ``People
won't be seeing the same skaters doing the same material.
	   ``One thing I said to the agents was in no way would I intend to
humiliate their clients. I think it is just a starting point with
this.''

Dollar lower against yen, stocks mixed at midday

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was lower against the yen at midday
Wednesday following its slip on overseas markets. Japanese stocks
turned mixed.
	   The dollar bought 121.84 yen in late morning trading, down 1.07
yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York
level of 122.17 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 63.37
points, or 0.43 percent, to end the morning session at 14,898.78.
On Tuesday, the Nikkei closed down 48.29 points, or 0.32 percent.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar remained weak against the yen
in the absence of fresh market-moving news after its slide on
overseas markets in reaction to the release of disappointing U.S.
economic data.
	   The National Association of Purchasing Management reported
Tuesday the manufacturing sector in the United States slowed for
the sixth consecutive month in November.
	   On the stock market, share prices were mixed as investors took
to the sidelines to monitor parliamentary debate on a
government-sponsored supplementary budget to spur the nation's
sagging economy.
	   Market players said trading was stuck in a narrow range amid a
lack of fresh news on the government's economic policies.
	   Investors also were reluctant to make significant moves ahead of
the sale of shares in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. and next
week's ``special quotation'' settlement of December futures and
options, traders said.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 0.29 points, or 0.03 percent, to 1,141.97. The
TOPIX closed down 1.24 points, or 0.11 percent, the day before.
	   The benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government bond was
quoted at 1.165 percent, up from Tuesday's close of 1.140 percent,
driving its price down to 105.44 yen from the previous day's
105.68.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ From bars in Hong Kong to the
United Nations, activists did what they could to turn the public's
attention to the battle against AIDS, which has reached epidemic
proportions in developing countries.
	   Although powerful new medicines are helping industrialized
countries fight the disease, it will kill millions of people this
year alone and is hitting hardest continents where people can't
afford the drugs.
	   About 33.4 million people around the world are infected with
HIV, two-thirds of them in sub-Saharan Africa. In Asia and the
Pacific, 700,000 people become infected with HIV per year.
	   In sub-Saharan Africa, the 1998 death toll from AIDS is expected
to be 2 million. Nearly 6 million more people will become infected
this year _ 1.7 million of them in sub-Saharan Africa.
	   ``In the case of HIV/AIDS, the difference in wealth becomes
literally matter of life and death,'' decried Mary Robinson, the
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.
	   Across the globe Tuesday, activists preached safe sex. People
pinned red ribbons on lapels to express solidarity in the fight
against AIDS. In San Juan, Puerto Rico, more than 3,000 people
formed a human red ribbon to commemorate World AIDS Day.
	   ``It's important to be here, to urge people to say `No' to AIDS
and to protect themselves,'' said Carlos Baerga, a free agent
baseball player most recently with the New York Mets. Those whose
loved ones died from AIDS planned to toss carnations into the
Atlantic Ocean in their memory.
	   _ In India, where up to 5 million people are HIV positive,
hundreds of schoolchildren marched beside prostitutes in New Delhi
to draw attention to the epidemic.
	   _Israelis and Palestinians handed out condoms and literature to
passengers departing Israel's international airport in Tel Aviv.
	   _ In Ivory Coast, thousands of children wearing T-shirts with
anti-AIDS slogans and bouncing inflated condoms like beach balls
marched through the streets of Abidjan.
	   _ In Kenya, children wearing black T-Shirts that said ``Stop
AIDS'' distributed condoms and pamphlets on AIDS prevention in
Dandora, an eastern Nairobi slum.
	   _ In Hong Kong's nightspots, activists handed out coasters with
pictures of a condom on one side and a safe-sex message on the
other.
	   _ In Tokyo, Japan's Health Ministry held rallies and concerts in
a central square.
	   _ In Moscow, a contraceptive company's employees sheathed in
red, yellow or green ``condom suits'' handed out condoms in Pushkin
Square.
	   _ In Pretoria, South Africa, clowns painted red AIDS ribbons on
people's faces as drum majorettes entertained a crowd.
	   Underneath it all was a life-and-death message: Practice safe
sex of face the consequences.
	   ``Come and witness the reality of AIDS. See the devastation in
our community. See the fresh graves,'' South African President
Nelson Mandela told hundreds of people in a village in
KwaZulu-Natal province, where an estimated 25 percent of adults are
infected with HIV.
	   But considering the enormity of the problem, the call to action
worldwide was muted.
	   In some countries like Zimbabwe, where an estimated 23 percent
of the population is infected with HIV, World AIDS day passed with
little fanfare. Countries in southern Africa have been slow to
recognize the unfolding tragedy and have little resources to fight
it.
	   It was only in October that the South African government
launched an AIDS awareness program. Already, more than 3 million
South Africans are infected. This year an estimated 168,000 have
died from AIDS.
	   The vast majority of those infected in Africa and other
developing regions cannot afford the drugs that are prolonging life
among AIDS patients in the West.
	   In Washington, President Bill Clinton announced dlrs 10 million
in emergency grants to help children orphaned by AIDS in poorer
nations. Much more assistance would be needed to help turn the
tide.
	   Actress Sharon Stone, speaking at the United Nations in New
York, urged parents to accept that they cannot control their
children's urge to have sex _ and to provide them with condoms so
they don't join the 7,000 young people who are infected every day
with HIV.
	   Stone, who campaigns for the American Foundation for AIDS
Research, spoke at a U.N. discussion on AIDS and youth.
	   ``If you truly, truly love your children, you need to supply
condoms in a place in your home, at a quantity that makes it a
non-judgmental situation for them to have them,'' she said.
	   And in New York, a rally near City Hall was overshadowed by
local politics, focusing on complaints about tightfisted security
that in recent months has all but cut off public access to the
governmental building and its surrounding plaza.
	   Several hundred demonstrators shielded by a federal court order
were greeted with steel barricades, metal detectors and scores of
police when they arrived at City Hall Tuesday to recognize the
worldwide threat of AIDS and recall its victims.
	   Nobody was arrested, and in the end, police erected several
barricaded pens in the parking lot, one holding 150 demonstrators,
a second with people who addressed the crowd and a third to hold TV
cameras and reporters.

South Korea to recognize brain death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ In a move that will facilitate organ
transplants, South Korea plans to recognize a brain dead person as
legally dead beginning next year.
	   The Ministry of Health and Welfare said Wednesday that
legislation will be enacted this month to legalize transplants of
the heart, liver and other vital organs from a brain dead person.
	   Currently, the heart must have stopped for a person to be
recognized as dead.
	   The legislation calls for the establishment of medical teams of
up to 10 members at the nation's major hospitals to decide whether
a person is brain dead.
	   A centralized organ donor center will also be established to
ease the matching of donors to recipients.
	   With two ruling coalition parties enjoying a majority in the
National Assembly and backing from the main opposition party, the
bill is expected to be passed without difficulty.

Japan Tobacco joins U.S. health payments deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan Tobacco Inc. has decided to take part in the
dlrs 206 billion settlement between U.S. states and the tobacco
industry for health care reimbursements.
	   Japan Tobacco will chip in about dlrs 1.4 million a year
starting in 2000, as its share in the settlement reached last month
between 46 states and four major U.S. tobacco companies, but its
share may increase over the years, spokesman Yoshiro Go said
Wednesday.
	   Japan Tobacco will also comply with other provisions of the
settlement, including restrictions on advertising and the targeting
of minors, but such terms will not affect its business in Japan, he
said.
	   Although it has not been sued in the United States, Japan
Tobacco decided to join the settlement Monday because that was seen
as a better business decision in the long term, Go said.
	   Japan Tobacco sells about 800 million cigarettes a year in the
United States, for a market share of about 0.15 percent.
	   At home, where it sells 256 billion cigarettes a year, or about
77 percent of the market, it is facing four lawsuits over alleged
tobacco-related illnesses.

Studies: Epilepsy drug relieves pain from diabetes, shingles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRENDA C. COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ New studies show that an epilepsy drug can bring
relief to diabetics who suffer pain from nerve damage and to people
with shingles who develop nerve pain that sometimes lasts for
years.
	   The two types of nerve pain afflict at least hundreds of
thousands and possibly millions of Americans.
	   In the new studies, the drug gabapentin (marketed as Neurontin)
worked as well as the usual drugs prescribed for such nerve pain _
tricyclic antidepressants _ have worked in past studies,
researchers said.
	   They did not directly compare the drugs in the findings
published in Wednesday's edition of The Journal of the American
Medical Association.
	   Gabapentin costs much more but many patients can't take
antidepressants for medical reasons or they find the side effects
intolerable, said experts not involved in the research.
	   After gabapentin was approved to control epileptic seizures in
1994, doctors quickly discovered that it also relieved nerve pain,
said one expert, Dr. Phillip A. Low, a neurology professor at the
Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.
	   Shingles is an infection by the chicken-pox virus of nerves
supplying certain areas of the skin, usually in people over 50. It
causes severe pain that has been described as tearing, burning,
piercing and ``electric shocklike.'' Shingles usually produces a
rash and goes away, but for 10 to 20 percent of sufferers, the
aftermath is pain that can last for years, researchers say.
	   For such pain, tricyclic antidepressants provide relief in only
about half of cases, so gabapentin may be a better first choice,
Low and a colleague, Dr. Rose M. Dotson, wrote in an editorial
accompanying the studies.
	   For diabetic nerve pain, tricyclics are still probably a better
first choice, since they are less expensive and doctors have more
experience with them, the editorial said, adding that further
research is needed.
	   Nerve pain is one of the most common and difficult types of pain
to treat, Low and Dotson wrote.
	   Gabapentin is one of several seizure-controlling medicines that
doctors have discovered can relieve it, even though none is
approved to be marketed for that purpose.
	   Seizure-controlling drugs and the tricyclics all modify brain
chemicals that regulate pain signals from nerves, Low and Dotson
said.
	   But the tricyclics can cause heart rhythm problems, low blood
pressure, grogginess, dry mouth, constipation, confusion and
urinary retention _ side effects that are dangerous in some
patients and intolerable in others, Low and Dotson said.
	   Gabapentin caused far fewer side effects in the new studies,
though some patients stopped taking it because of drowsiness or
dizziness, researchers said.
	   In one study, led by Dr. Miroslav Backonja of the University of
Wisconsin, Madison, 70 patients with diabetic nerve pain who were
randomly assigned to receive gabapentin for eight weeks had
significantly less pain and better sleep than 65 patients who were
given a placebo. Patients were studied at 20 different sites and
did not know whether they received the drug or the dummy pill.
	   In the other study, led by Dr. Michael Rowbotham of the
University of California, San Francisco, similar differences were
found among 89 patients given gabapentin and 95 given placebos for
four weeks at 16 study sites to treat pain syndromes following
shingles.
	   Both studies were funded by Neurontin maker Parke-Davis, a
division of Warner-Lambert Co., Morris Plains, New Jersey.

Faldo hopes to end season on a high note
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DENNIS PASSA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Englishman Nick Faldo has a blunt
assessment of 1998 prior to his win with David Carter in the World
Cup of golf last month in New Zealand.
	   ``It has been great _ for the last two weeks,'' Faldo said
Wednesday after a practice round at the Australian Open.
``Previously it was lousy. At least it has turned around, I can see
the light at the end of the tunnel.''
	   In October, Faldo's 12-year marriage to his second wife, Gill,
formally ended in divorce. Earlier in the month, Faldo, 41, said
that he and his American girlfriend, Brenna Cepelak, were ending
their three-year relationship.
	   Faldo has struggled on the US Tour this year but says he has
gained confidence after firing mentor David Leadbetter and
employing Chip Koehkle.
	   ``When there is a lot flying around, it is difficult to feel
good about your golf game and focus on it,'' Faldo said Wednesday
when asked about his problems off the golf course.
	   He feels confident about his chances in the Australian Open,
although perhaps not as optimistic as Peter Thomson, the five-time
British Open champion who redesigned Royal Adelaide and has tipped
Faldo to win.
	   ``I didn't play very well today, so I'll go out later and try to
work on some things,'' Faldo said.
	   ``The rough is very thick in some places. You can miss the
fairway by a yard _ and you are aiming at a fairway that is 23
yards wide _ and you are unplayable, still 200 yards from the
green. I think that is probably unnecessary.''
	   Faldo says he's working on a few different things under Koehkle.
	   ``The swing has been a bit out of synch, the arm and body
swing,'' said Faldo. ``We have been trying to find what I lost over
the last couple of seasons which was the feeling in my right hand
through impact.
	   ``It wasn't coming in the same as it used to in the early 1990s.
That really was a key for me.''
	   Faldo admits he's not hitting as many practice balls as he used
to.
	   ``I prefer productive practice,'' says Faldo. ``Ten years ago I
used to hit 1,500 a day. Physically I couldn't do that now. I'd
rather go down there for an hour and work on exactly what I've got
to work on.''
	   Faldo, a three-time U.S. Masters and British Open champion, says
he has 11 months of golf planned for 1999.
	   ``Next year I am trying to do both tours (European and U.S.) and
make the Ryder Cup team,'' said Faldo. ``The goals are still the
same _ being No. 1 and winning events. Winning as much as possible.
That's what I want to get back to.'' (djp)

Mets, Dodgers and Orioles in 3-way trade, Palmeiro to Texas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details; Mets refusing comment on whether Ventura
deal had been completed &QL; 
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Another wild day in U.S. baseball's offseason
marketplace left half a dozen big names on new teams.
	   After Rafael Palmeiro went back to Texas, Otis Nixon returned to
Atlanta and Albert Belle formalized his deal with Baltimore, the
New York Mets, Los Angeles Dodgers and Orioles pulled off a
surprising three-way trade.
	   When the wheel stopped spinning Tuesday night, New York had
acquired outfielder Roger Cedeno from the Dodgers and reliever
Armando Benitez from the Orioles, Baltimore got catcher Charles
Johnson and Los Angeles wound up with catcher Todd Hundley and
minor league pitcher Arnold Gooch.
	   In addition, it appeared the Mets also had reached agreement
with third baseman Robin Ventura, with the team refusing to confirm
or deny whether a deal had been completed.
	   The big money deals (Palmeiro dlrs 45 million for five years)
and Belle (dlrs 65 million for five years), were overshadowed by
the big three-way trade, a rarity in baseball's free-agent era.
	   First, the Mets sent Hundley and Gooch to the Dodgers for
Johnson and Cedeno, and then they sent Johnson to Baltimore for
Benitez.
	   ``It is a bittersweet day in Mets history with Todd Hundley
leaving the organization,'' Mets general manager Steve Phillips
said. ``We feel we've added in Armando Benitez one of the best
power pitchers in the game, and somebody who will give us a
completely different look in the bullpen.''
	   Hundley, who is to be paid dlrs 5.2 million next season and dlrs
6 million in 2000, became expendable after New York kept Mike
Piazza with a dlrs 91 million, seven-year deal in October.
	   Hundley struggled last season after returning from the disabled
list in July following reconstructive surgery on his right elbow at
the end of the 1997 season.
	   He hit just .161 with three homers, 12 RBIs and 55 strikeouts in
124 at-bats, limiting his trade value. Before the injury, Hundley
was one of the most feared hitters in the league.
	   Hundley, a 29-year-old switch-hitter, set a big-league record
for homers by a catcher in 1996, hitting 41 to surpass Roy
Campanella's 43-year-old standard. Hundley also hit .259 and drove
in 112 runs that year.
	   Benitez gives the Mets added depth in their bullpen. He went 5-6
with a 3.82 ERA and 22 saves last season for Baltimore. He will
most likely be the right-handed setup man for closer John Franco.
	   Johnson, 27, came to the Dodgers along with Gary Sheffield,
Bobby Bonilla, Jim Eisenreich and a minor league pitcher for Piazza
and third baseman Todd Zeile last May 15. Piazza was traded to the
Mets a week later.
	   Johnson played in 133 games with the Marlins and Dodgers last
season and hit just .218 with 19 homers and 58 RBIs.
	   The 24-year-old Cedeno, a switch hitter long considered a top
prospect, played in 105 games for the Dodgers last season and hit
.242 with two homers and 17 RBIs.
	   Before the big trade, Palmeiro returned to Texas, the team he
left after the 1993 season to sign a dlrs 30.35 million, five-year
contract with Baltimore.
	   Palmeiro turned down a dlrs 50 million, five-year offer to
remain with the Orioles, instead going to the Ballpark in Arlington
on Tuesday _ without his agent _ and accepting a deal that includes
yearly salaries of dlrs 9 million, of which dlrs 1 million a season
will be deferred.
	   His decision ends the Texas career of Will Clark, who replaced
him five years ago and now seems headed to Baltimore or Boston.
	   Atlanta, which also re-signed infielder Ozzie Guillen to a
two-year contract, brought back Nixon, who played for the Braves
from 1991-93 and turns 40 in January. The Braves apparently will
attempt to trade Ryan Klesko, leaving Nixon in a crowded outfield
that includes free-agent signee Brian Jordan and returnees Andruw
Jones and Gerald Williams.

Graves of 7,000 Japanese soldiers unearthed in Thailand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Excavation has begun for about 7,000
graves of Japanese soldiers who perished during World War II, the
Japanese embassy said Wednesday.
	   Japan's Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare is
sponsoring the excavation in hopes of identifying some of the
soldiers and providing answers for families of soldiers still
listed as missing, said Hideki Yamada, first secretary at the
embassy in Bangkok.
	   The site, near Mae Hong Son, 650 kilometers (404 miles) north of
Bangkok and near the border with Myanmar, is an abandoned cemetery
of Japan's Imperial Army.
	   The Japanese government only learned of its existence earlier
this year, Yamada said.
	   The soldiers died as they trekked out of Myanmar, then known as
Burma, after the Japanese surrendered in 1945.
	   The Thai workers, hired by the Japanese government, performed
Buddhist religious rites Tuesday before beginning the five-day dig.

Rehearsal show promises spectacular Asian Games opening

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ For a few hours Sunday, Thais will be
able to cast aside worries about the lingering Asian economic
crisis and revel in a spectacular cultural celebration marking the
opening of the 13th Asian Games.
	   Several thousand people got a sneak preview of the festivities
Tuesday when the final rehearsal for the ceremony was thrown open
to the public at the last minute.
	   The rehearsal was originally supposed to be open, then last week
was turned into a closed activity for what organizers said were
security reasons.
	   ``Besides, we don't want to give away the climax of the event,''
Somjainuk Engtrakul, chairman of the ticketing committee, told
reporters about an hour before Tuesday's rehearsal began.
	   But stadium guards somehow slipped up and about 1,500 ordinary
citizens were admitted to the crowd that was originally supposed to
be limited to members of the press, foreign dignitaries, government
officials and the games' organizers.
	   With the gates breached, the decision was made to admit all
comers, and many of the stadium's 60,000 seats quickly filled up.
	   The lucky spectators watched 7,614 performers take part in a
nearly four-hour show of lavishly-produced acts with the theme
``Friendship Beyond Frontiers.''
	   The combined budget for the opening and closing ceremonies is 70
million baht (dlrs 1.94 million) and that includes a large share of
donated and at-cost labor.
	   For an overture, songs written by the country's multi-talented
King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest-reigning monarch, were
played by the Western-style Bangkok Symphony Orchestra along with
the Fong Nam band, a kind of new wave traditional Thai ensemble.
	   The emphasis shifted to the visual for the next act, as hundreds
of performers in ancient Thai garb marched down the center of the
field to a majestic tune, followed by people-drawn chariots.
	   Hundreds of primary school students dressed in colorful outfits
for the next two performances, celebrating both the unity of Asia
and Chai-yo, the cartoon elephant mascot of the games. Elephants
have long been a symbol of Thailand.
	   The athletes' march then followed _ with performers as stand-ins
_ with representatives of the 41 countries taking place in what
organizers bill as the last major sporting event of the 20th
century.
	   At the actual event on Sunday, King Bhumibol will officially
proclaim the games open.
	   Issaraporn Suktha, a gold medal weightlifter for Thailand at the
last Southeast Asian Games, will then carry the torch into the
stadium, and Somluck Khamsing, a boxer who won Thailand's
first-ever Olympic gold medal in 1996 in Atlanta, will take it the
last lap to light the flame.
	   The artistic high point came next, as the warlike beat of drums
announced the Gathering of Heavenly Spirits, a show based on the
Indian Ramayana epic, the basis for much of traditional Thai
mythology, literature, and performing and fine arts.
	   The field became a swirl of giant snakes, swans, birds, angels,
and other mystical creatures, all cheered by the crowd.
	   Another performance celebrating the unity of Asia capped the
show, with four large swan floats pulled to the middle of the
field, to each tethered a giant balloon symbolizing the sun, moon,
earth and a giant lotus.
	   ``The lighting was 80 percent OK, while the sound was 90
percent,'' said Thisana Duandao, a producer with JSL, the private
company putting on the show. ``Overall, we are satisfied with the
performance. We have minor adjustments to make.''
	   Bhichai Rattakul, deputy prime minister and chairman of the
Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee, who has been losing sleep
over whether organizational problems can be overcome at the last
minute, pronounced himself ``very happy.''

More than 500 police carried out a massive drugs sting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ More than 500 police officers swarmed a suspected
drugs lair used by traffickers to supply millions of pounds
(dollars) of cocaine _ in one of the largest raids ever in central
London.
	   Scotland Yard said Wednesday that 39 people were arrested for
drugs and drugs-related offenses after the Tuesday night raid on a
four-story building on Charing Cross Road, the heart of the
capital's theater district. Police said the building, which had
been operating as an unlicensed club, was a clearing house for
illegal drugs.
	   ''This has been running for months,'' Police Chief
Superintendent Jim Overton said. ''Rather than just go for the
people in there, we are going for the organizers ... We are very
pleased with the results so far. It looks very, very promising.''
	   The substances found were still being analyzed, and the search
of the building was expected to continue throughout Wednesday.
	   Describing the building as a ''fortified drugs warehouse,''
Overton said hundreds of officers were needed because the building
was reinforced with steel doors and floors. Two other addresses in
London had also been searched in connection with the investigation.
	   Police released no other information.

Tokio Marine considering tie-up with Schwab
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A major Japanese insurer is looking into a possible
tie-up with U.S. discount brokerage Charles Schwab and Co.
	   Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co. said Wednesday that no
decision has been reached.
	   Leading financial daily, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, reported
Wednesday that the two companies plan to set up an
Internet-brokerage venture in Japan with capital participation from
three other companies in Tokio's Mitsubishi group.
	   If the deal materializes, Tokio Marine and Fire will be the
first Japanese nonlife insurer to enter the securities business
under the so-called Big Bang, a much publicized program by the
Japanese government to ease regulations and stimulate competition.
	   The Big Bang is expected to facilitate foreign participation in
the Japanese financial markets over the next several years.
	   In recent months, several Japanese banks also announced major
tie-ups with foreign banks.
	   Nihon Keizai said the two companies are expected to work out an
agreement by the end of December. The two will draw up a marketing
plan before April 1999, and the new brokerage will start in the
summer, it said.
	   The joint venture will market an array of financial products to
individuals mainly on the Internet, Nihon Keizai said.
	   The venture will market through Tokio Marine's network of
insurance agents as well as its own branches, in addition to a
telephone center handling direct sales.
	   The joint venture is expected to be capitalized at between 10
billion yen and 20 billion yen (dlrs 82 million and dlrs 164
million), with Charles Schwab holding a 50 percent share and Tokio
Marine 30 percent.
	   Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp. and
Meiji Life Insurance Co. are likely to take stakes of 5 percent or
10 percent each, Nihon Keizai said.

Apple Computer will open office in Thailand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Apple Computer will open an office in
Thailand to boost its marketing efforts as its troubled Thai
distributor cuts back on promotional budgets, the Bangkok Post
reported on Wednesday.
	   Thailand is the U.S. computer-maker's second largest market in
Asia with 85,000 users, 90 percent of whom use Apple products for
design and publishing work, company officials were quoted as
saying.
	   Apple executive are hoping to increase sales with the
introduction of their new iMac model, the newspaper said.
	   Graham Long, Apple's president of Asia Pacific operations, was
quoted as saying that its Thai distributor Sahaviriya Office
Automation was doing less marketing than in the past.
	   He cited no reason for Sahaviriya's reduced marketing role, but
the company has been hard hit by Thailand's economic and financial
crises.
	   ``We are now being more aggressive in marketing Apple,'' Long
was quoted as saying by the Post. He also said the company had
recently opened an office in South Korea.

Papua New Guinea blackout continue for second day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ The power blackout in
Papua New Guinea continued for the second day, forced by a
nationwide strike by trade unions protesting the government's
budget.
	   The strike was called last Friday, to demand Prime Minister Bill
Skate to redraft next year's budget, which slashes spending across
most government departments, axes 7,000 public service jobs and
abolishes key research institutions.
	   About 1,300 workers for the main power supplier, Elcom, have cut
power to all homes and businesses throughout the country from 8
a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
	   Elcom National Staff Association general secretary Philip Kaira
said it may begin targeting the blackout at only customers who owe
large sums of money to Elcom in unpaid bills.
	   Kaira said the unions may disconnect power supplies to
government buildings and offices, including the Parliament House in
Port Moresby.
	   Skate, who has refused to redraft the budget, says the strike is
politically motivated and illegal.

Philippine exports plunge 8.7 percent in October
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ In the first major slump in
Philippine exports since the start of Asia's currency crisis,
exports shrank 8.7 percent in October from the previous month to
dlrs 2.542 billion, the government announced Wednesday.
	   Export growth was also sharply lower on an annual basis,
dropping to 9.3 percent in October from 19 percent in September,
the National Statistics Office said.
	   The Philippines had enjoyed annual export growth of more than 20
percent for much of the past several years, showing remarkable
resilience to the effects of the 17-month currency crisis.
	   But economists said they expected a slowdown in export growth
because of weaker worldwide demand following the slowdown in the
global economy.
	   Luz Lorenzo, economist for ATR Securities Inc., said the
Philippines also faces increased competition from Asian neighbors
that are making efforts to increase exports to recover from the
regional financial crisis.
	   ``We may have to share our gains with our neighbors,'' she said.
	   Joey Cuyegkeng, economist for ING Barings Securities Philippines
Inc., also blamed the agricultural sector for the slowdown in
export growth.
	   Agricultural production contracted 3.1 percent in the third
quarter of this year because of the aftereffects of a prolonged
drought which was followed by strong typhoons.
	   For the first 10 months of the year, exports rose 18 percent to
dlrs 24.39 billion, the statistics office said.
	   Lorenzo said she expects Philippine export growth will slip to
16 percent for the entire year compared to 1997.
	   Electronics and components accounted for 56 percent of total
October exports, grossing dlrs 1.43 billion, 32 percent more than
the year-earlier level.
	   The second top export category was garments, which generated
dlrs 165 million, down 1.4 percent from the year-earlier level.
	   Computer parts and peripherals accounted for dlrs 127.1 million
of October exports, 18 percent less than a year before.
	   The United States remained the country's top export destination,
accounting for 33 percent of total October shipments, or dlrs 849.5
million, 6.7 more higher than the year-earlier level.
	   Japan followed with a 14 percent share totaling dlrs 351.2
million, 12 percent less than a year earlier, reflecting Japan's
weakening economy.
	   The government announces import figures separately each month.

Prime minister improves his chances of survival with coalition deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT KEITH-REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ The coalition deal announced this week by
Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka will greatly improve his chances of
retaining office after a general election expected in May.
	   Rabuka said Tuesday he had agreed with the National Federated
and United General parties to work together with to set up a
coalition. Rabuka heads the SVT, or Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni
Taukei, meaning ``Fijian Political Party,'' which heads the present
government.
	   The National Federated Party, or NFP, is backed by the bulk of
the Indian community that comprises 43 percent of the 800,000
population. It controls two-thirds of Indian communal seats in the
present Parliament and is expected to at least retain that strength
after the May election.
	   The United General Party, or UGP, is backed by minority
European, European-Chinese and other small communities and is
expected to emerge from the May election with at least the five
seats it has in the present Parliament.
	   The NFP leader, opposition leader Jai Ram Reddy, is one of the
government ministers ousted and jailed in 1987 when then Col.
Rabuka led a Fijian nationalist coup against a newly elected
Indian-dominated government.
	   Reddy and Rabuka reconciled in recent years and were the key
figures in securing a democratic constitution as a replacement for
one condemned internationally after it imposition by a post coup
regime.
	   Since the new constitution does not guarantee Fijians the
complete political supremacy they had under the former
constitution, Fijian nationalist extremist splinter groups have
emerged with the aim of toppling Rabuka.
	   Local commentators say the splintering of Fijian loyalties, plus
anti-Rabuka parties backed by chiefs who disapprove of Rabuka's
commoner background, present a serious threat to Rabuka.
	   The agreement with the NFP and UGP should ensure him at least 25
or 30 seats in the new 71-seat Parliament in addition to the
numbers he can reasonably hope to pick up for the SVT.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Brian Leetch tied the game with one second left
in regulation and Adam Graves' second goal of the night at 2:10 of
overtime gave the New York Rangers a 5-4 victory over the Florida
Panthers on Tuesday night.
	   The Panthers, led by rookies Mark Parrish and Oleg Kvasha,
appeared to be on their way to their third straight victory when
Leetch tied the game at 4 with a deflected shot from just outside
the crease.
	   Graves, who had earlier tied the game at 3, then scored his 10th
on a passout from behind the net by Todd Harvey.
	   Dave Gagner and Radek Dvorak also scored for Florida. Wayne
Gretzky and John MacLean scored power-play goals for New York.
 &UR; Bruins 1, Canucks 1, OT &QC; 
	   In Boston, Sergei Samsonov scored with 29 seconds remaining in
the second period to lift the Boston Bruins into a 1-1 tie with the
Vancouver Canucks.
	   With the deadlock, the Bruins extended their unbeaten streak to
six games while the Canucks broke a five-game losing streak.
	   Samsonov scored his ninth of the seson when Chris Taylor's shot
was deflected off the pad of Canucks goalie Garth Snow.
	   The Canucks had taken the lead on Mark Messier's goal at 13:27
of the opening period.
 &UR; Devils 4, Capitals 0 &QC; 
	   In Washington, Martin Brodeur stopped 22 shots for his second
shutout of the season as New Jersey blanked Washington.
	   Jason Arnott, Jay Pandolfo, Denis Pederson and Bobby Holik each
scored for the Devils. The win moves New Jersey into first place in
the Eastern Conference with 29 points, passing idle Toronto (28).
	   It was the second time the Capitals have been shut out in their
last three games.
 &UR; Mighty Ducks 4, Penguins 4 &QC; 
	   In Pittsburgh, Martin Straka scored his 14th goal midway through
the third period to pull Pittsburgh into a tie with Anaheim,
despite a four-assist game by the Mighty Ducks' Teemu Selanne.
	   Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr scored twice to end a 10-game goal
drought, his longest since he went 17 games without a goal as a
rookie in 1990-91.
	   The Mighty Ducks broke a three-game losing streak, but are 1-4-1
since a three-game winning streak.
	   Selanne set up goals by Steve Rucchin and Travis Green early in
the third period for a 4-3 Penguin lead.
 &UR; Senators 3, Predators 1 &QC; 
	   In Nashville, Tennessee, the oft-injured Daniel Alfredsson had
his first multi-point game of the year with a goal and an assist to
lead Ottawa over Nashville, the Senators' fifth win in their last
six games.
	   Alfredsson scored on a wrist shot from the slot 4:53 into the
second period and assisted on Radek Bonk's first-period tally.
	   Ottawa goaltender Ron Tugnutt, making his first road start of
the year after six at home, came within 7:34 of his ninth career
shutout.
	   With 4:18 left, Ottawa's Shaun Van Allen missed a penalty shot
when he fired wide left.

Thai government cuts bonuses for state enterprise executives
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's cash-strapped government has
cut year-end bonuses for executives of state enterprises, but
spared rank and file workers because of concerns about a possible
backlash.
	   State enterprise workers organizations had threatened
retaliation against the government if bonuses were cut for regular
workers, according to Wednesday's Bangkok Post.
	   In Thailand, many workers count on a large year-end bonus
totaling several months pay to make up for low monthly salaries.
	   During the last two years, violence erupted at some private
companies when they told workers their bonuses would be reduced
because of a bad business year.
	   An announcement from the Cabinet on Wednesday said executives of
state enterprises must have their bonuses for 1999 reduced by at
least 30 percent.
	   The rule will also apply to non-state enterprises in which the
government or state enterprises hold more than a 50 percent stake.
	   State enterprise workers recently staged a protest in front of
parliament, angry and fearful over austerity and privatization
plans they argue are being forced on the government by the
International Monetary Fund as part of its bailout of the Thai
economy.
	   Thailand is in the midst of its worst economic crisis in modern
times and is receiving a dlrs 17.2 billion rescue package from the
IMF.
	   The IMF has required Thailand to undertake economic reforms that
include privatizing state enterprises, which are generally viewed
as inefficient.
	   The government has countered state enterprise workers' claims by
saying that privatization is not being forced upon by the IMF, but
is being done to make the economy more competitive.

New resort deal approved by Fiji government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ Fiji's Cabinet has approved a French-led
consortium's plan to build a resort complex on one of the Pacific
island nation's finest beaches, Information Minister Filipe Bole
said Wednesday.
	   The consortium, led by Gerard Saliot of D.B. Group Asia Pacific,
of Paris and Hong Kong, planned to invest Fiji dollars 560 million
(U.S. dlrs 280 million) in building resorts at Natadola Beach on
Fiji's main island of Viti Levu, Bole said.
	   The resort complex would be managed by Four Seas, Club Med and
other operators, he said.
	   Natadola Beach is on the on the southwest coast of Viti Levy and
is regarded as the island's finest beach.
	   The government plans to invest Fiji dollars 40 million (U.S.
dlrs 20 million) in roads, water and electricity for the Natadola
beach area, Bole said.
	   The Natadola Beach Co., involving CIG Enterprises of Paris and
Asia Pacific International of Hong Kong, has acquired 808 acres
(327 hectares) of land at the beach.
	   Bole said the development will begin in 1999, to be completed by
2009. A 300-room four- or five-star hotel and an 18 hole golf
course are slated as the first construction project.
	   Fiji receives about 370,000 tourists a year, and that is
expected to grow to 433,000 by 2001.

 &UR; Thomson takes the heat for course revamp &QL; 
 &UR; EDs: adds details on Norman's Wednesday practice, quotes in last
graf from Billy Mayfair, TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By DENNIS PASSA
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ As Australian golf's father figure,
Peter Thomson seemed a natural to captain the Down Under-dominated
International team at next week's Presidents Cup at Royal
Melbourne.
	   But this week, five-time British Open winner Thomson is taking
the heat from a number of golfers at the Australian Open, including
Presidents Cup player Stuart Appleby of Australia, over Thomson's
design changes to Royal Adelaide.
	   ``I expected there will be controversy,'' Thomson said Wednesday
as Greg Norman, playing his first 72-hole tournament since
undergoing shoulder surgery eight months ago, toured Royal Adelaide
in advance of Thursday's opening round.
	   Thomson has added about 300 meters to the now par-72,
6,565-meter (7,178-yard) course, grown out the rough and extended
it further into the fairways and added 20 bunkers. Royal Adelaide's
small greens have been left, well, small.
	   Norman was in a relaxed mood during his practice round
Wednesday, laughing with spectators despite swirling winds that
made the course play difficult.
	   He's kept comments about the course to himself, but his body
language during Tuesday's pro-am indicated he wasn't happy. He
appeared to be upset when after finishing pin-high down the left
side of the green on the short par-4 third, he found his ball
submerged in knee-high rough and could only blast it into similar
territory on the other side.
	   ``Where do you play to?'' he was heard to murmur to his caddie,
Tony Navarro.
	   Appleby said he could see no reason to change the course.
	   ``I don't know what was wrong with it,'' said Appleby. ``There
is a real fine line between pleasure and pain. You are going to see
some pretty ugly shots.
	   ``We are now hitting four irons where we used to hit seven irons
into some places,'' added Appleby. ``Shots are longer but we are
talking about green sizes that haven't changed. I've never seen a
course become harder by so much.''
	   Local newspaper reports have one unnamed player suggesting that
Thomson has ``lost his marbles,'' while another is quoted he'll do
the ``full monty'' _ strip naked _ in front of the clubhouse if
anyone in the field breaks par in all four rounds.
	   Thomson won three of his five British Opens at Royal Birkdale,
Royal Lytham and St. Anne's, and he says it's only natural that he
would lean towards seaside links in his course preference.
	   ``I didn't hear anyone complaining about Royal Birkdale, Troon
or Lytham,'' said Thomson. ``That's because it's the British Open
and you expect it. But why shouldn't we expect it at the Australian
Open?''
	   Englishman Nick Faldo isn't complaining _ he said he enjoyed the
traditional touches of Scottish golf architect Alister Mackenzie,
who also designed Augusta National and Royal Melbourne. Thomson has
tipped Faldo, a winner of six majors, as the likely Australian Open
winner.
	   ``It's a fantastic course, naturally challenging and full of
wonderful Mackenzie bunkering,'' Faldo said Wednesday.
	   U.S. Presidents Cup team members Fred Couples and John Huston
are also in the Australian Open field, along with other
International members Craig Parry of Australia, New Zealand's Frank
Nobilo and Greg Turner and Paraguay's Carlos Franco.
	   Couples and Huston, possible partners in the Presidents Cup,
played a leisurely practice round Wednesday morning. Couples
watched in amazement on the par-4 sixth when gusty winds blew putt
after practice putt away from the hole.
	   American Billy Mayfair had similar problems Wednesday.
	   ``There were a few times when I actually putted off the green,''
said Mayfair. ``The balls were rolling all over the place, and
there are some subtle breaks. If someone can get it going with the
putter, they've definitely read the greens well.''
