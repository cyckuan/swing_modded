<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on U.N. Mission in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Friday met behind closed doors to discuss whether the
United Nations would carry on its presence in the war-torn Angola
against the backdrop of the opposition from the capital Luanda.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council held the consultations after U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan has made repeated contacts with the
Angolan Government to persuade it into accepting the U.N. presence
in the southwest country.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council issued here on Friday,
Annan said, "I intend to continue consultations with the
Government of Angola concerning the modalities of the future
presence of the United Nations and will inform the Security
Council in due course of the outcome of these consultations."
</P>
<P>
In response, Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos had a
letter sent to Annan, asking for the U.N. Observer Mission in
Angola (MONUA) to leave the country after its mandate expires on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
An exit would be the latest in a series of U.N. withdrawals
from African wars, including Somalia and Rwanda, which have posed
a challenge to the organization's ability to maintain peace and
security in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Angola remains grave, with heave fighting
continuing to rage in several parts of the country," Annan said in
his report, "Deep animosity and distrust have persisted between
the Government of Angola and the National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA)."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council proposed in a resolution last month that a
special representative be based in Luanda but President dos Santos
turned down this idea, saying that any envoy should stay in New
York and visit his country occasionally.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of fighting broke out in December last year,
leading to the breakdown of a 1994 peace accord aimed at ending
decades of war in the country.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Announces Budget With Projected Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Singapore government Friday
dished out a focused budget with a projected deficit and gave key
priorities to education and training as well as high value-added
sectors in an knowledge-based economy.
</P>
<P>
Total expenditure, comprising operating and development
expenditure, is estimated at 29.2 billion Singapore dollars (17.18
billion U.S. dollars) in financial year 1999, an increase of 5.6
percent or 1.5 billion Singapore dollars (882 million U.S.
dollars) over the previous year with a large part of it from the
development expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Revenue collection is projected to fall from 27.7 billion
Singapore dollars (16.29 billion U.S. dollars) in financial year
1998 to 24.1 billion Singapore dollars (14.18 billion U.S.
dollars) this year, a 3.1-billion-Singapore-dollar or 11.4-percent
decline.
</P>
<P>
The shrinking revenue incurs an operating deficit of 5.1
billion Singapore dollars (3 billion U.S. dollars) or 3.5 percent
of the gross domestic product (GDP) projected for this year.
</P>
<P>
In his budget statement, Minister for Fiancee Richard Hu said
the budget deficit will be funded entirely from surpluses
accumulated by the government in its current term of office.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the expenditure in 1999 will continue to be
allocated to defense and education at 25 percent and 19 percent of
the total government spending respectively.
</P>
<P>
Defense spending remains at the 1998 level of 7.3 billion
Singapore dollars (4.29 billion U.S. dollars), accounting for 5.1
percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
Allocation for education is 5.7 billion Singapore dollars (3.35
billion U.S. dollars) with its share of the GDP increasing
steadily from 3 percent in financial year 1997 to 3.4 percent in
1998 and to just under 4 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a total of 150 million Singapore dollars (88.24
million U.S. dollars) are allocated in 1999 for upgrading and
retraining workers to ensure employability in an increasingly
knowledge-based economy.
</P>
<P>
The share for the social and community services sector has
increased to 39 percent of the budget over 1998 on account of
higher spending on education and public housing.
</P>
<P>
Operating expenditure is budgeted at 15.2 billion Singapore
(8.94 billion U.S. dollars), increasing by 300 million Singapore
dollars (176.47 million U.S. dollars) compared to 1998. Operating
expenditure will rise to 10.7 percent of the GDP, up from 10.4
percent in 1998 and 9.7 percent in 1997. Total development
spending will amount to 13.9 billion Singapore dollars (8.18
billion U.S. dollars), increasing by 1.2 billion Singapore dollars
(705.8 million U.S. dollars) from 12.7 billion Singapore dollars
(7.47 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998 with an aim to invest in
strategic development projects to pump-prime the economy in the
short term.
</P>
<P>
In the budget, some tax incentives are introduced to promote
the development of certain high value-added sectors of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
However, it is noted that the budget does not include any new
measures to stimulate the economy and the much talked expectation
for more tax cut and rebate is not met.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Local Election Polls Extended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran's election headquarters
announced on Friday that the deadline for the country's first
ever local elections has been extended by one or two hours in
different provinces for the second time.
</P>
<P>
The polling were scheduled to end at 16:00 local time (1230
GMT), but the new deadline for voting has been prolonged to 19:00
(1530 GMT) or 20:00 (1630 GMT) in various parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The extension was made due to massive turnout and the people's
enthusiasm, the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted a statement
from the headquarters as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian people turned out massively on Friday to elect
councilors of cities, towns and villages, the first time since
the Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
As the polling officially kicked off at 8:00 a.m. (0430 GMT),
long queues were seen on the live reports throughout the country
by the state television.
</P>
<P>
Like the presidential elections in 1997, many elders and women
turned out to cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
Both of the two rival factions in the country have pinned a
great deal of hope on the elections. The moderates expect to push
forward the political reforms promised by President Khatami and
the conservatives intend to strengthen their control on the
country's important organs.
</P>
<P>
A total of 298,865 candidates are running for about 200,000
seats in councils of 720 cities, towns and villages throughout
the country after some candidates withdrew from the
election.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that 334,141 people have been qualified
for the elections.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian constitution and relevant laws, all
Iranians above 15 years old, or some 39 million out of the
country's 65 million population are eligible to vote in the
elections.

<HEADLINE> Museveni, British Minister on Congo (K) Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni held discussions on the current situation in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) with British Secretary of State
for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Tony Lloyd here Friday.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued Friday evening by the Ugandan
President's Office said that the secretary of state, who arrived
here Thursday night, is on a mission to the region to discuss with
regional leaders on the situation in Congo (K) and the prospects
for a peaceful resolution to the nearly seven- month conflict.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd delivered a special message to the Ugandan president from
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and expressed the prime
minister's concern about the continued conflict in the vast
central African country.
</P>
<P>
Britain is in full support of the regional peace initiative
aimed at putting an end to the war, he said.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Museveni reiterated Uganda's position that
the conflict should be resolved politically instead of militarily.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the international community should
seriously consider funding a neutral force which will come in and
provide internal security while at the same time addressing the
security concerns of the DRC' s neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Any negotiations to end the conflict should address both the
internal and the regional dimensions of the problem, he added.
</P>
<P>
Uganda welcomes emerging indications that the belligerent
groups in the DRC are willing to talk to each other anywhere and
at any time convenient, the president asserted.
</P>
<P>
The visiting British secretary of state, who has been to
Zimbabwe, Angola, the DRC and Rwanda, briefed Museveni about his
discussions with the leaders of those countries, saying that he
will proceed to Addis Ababa, capital of Ethiopia to hold talks
with Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
Salim Ahmed Salim.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Ethnic Albanian Delegates Want to Form Provisional Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Kosovo's ethnic Albanian
delegates at the Rambouillet peace talks decided on Wednesday to
form a "Kosovo provisional government" and appointed the spokesman
of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) Jakup Krasic as its premier-
designate.
</P>
<P>
Hidajt Hiseni, vice president of the Union of Democratic
Movement in the southern Serbian province of Kosovo in Yugoslavia,
announced the news Friday, the Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Hiseni told an Albanian-language newspaper that the above
decision was approved by all members of the ethnic Albanian
delegation at the peace talks in France. However, the appointment
of Krasic would be formally announced "after some time" as
requested by Krasic himself.
</P>
<P>
The report said that KLA's political leader Adem Demaci was
strongly opposed to the formation of the provisional government,
deeming it illegal.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Rugova, chairman of the Democratic League of Kosovo,
reportedly said in a statement on Friday that the ethnic Albanian
delegation at the Rambouillet talks was interested in "securing a
peace deal as early as possible to ensure the safety of all the
Kosovars."
</P>
<P>
Rugova contended that the talks were aimed at stemming
bloodshed and putting the Kosovo autonomous regime to function so
as to open bright prospects for the Kosovars.

<HEADLINE> Russia Signs Customs Agreement With Four Former Soviet Republics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
signed a customs agreement Friday with the leaders of four former
Soviet Republics to eliminate customs barriers and encourage
business between the countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed by presidents of Russia, Belarus,
Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, is an important document in
the customs integration process of the five countries, Yeltsin
said at the five countries' customs union council meeting Friday.
</P>
<P>
"There is no alternative to our integration and development of
mutual cooperation," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko, Kazakh President
Nursulatn Nazarbayev, Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev and Tajik
President Emomali Rakhmovnov also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Russia, Belarus, Kazakstan and Kyrgyzstan formed a customs
union in 1996 to consolidate their economic reform efforts and
deepen their economic integration. The four countries were joined
by Tajikistan later.
</P>
<P>
Russia, Belarus, Kazakstan and Kyrgyzstan first agreed to
remove customs barriers in 1996, but the union has made little
progress in increasing trade among its five countries since it has
been plagued with an array of problems.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The British government rejected
Calls on Friday for Home Secretary Jack Straw to resign over the
publication of details of witnesses in the Stephen Lawrence case.
</P>
<P>
Home Office minister Paul Boateng denied that Straw or his
officials were to blame for the publication of witnesses' names
and addresses in appendices to the report on the police
investigation of the racist murder.
</P>
<P>
He told MPs that the chairman of the inquiry team, Sir William
Macpherson, had accepted full responsibility for the blunder.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a matter that cannot be put at the door of the
Home Office," he said.
</P>
<P>
Several of the named informants are now under police protection
after their names were made public and the opposition Conservative
party MPs have called Straw to resign for the error.
</P>
<P>
Distribution of the report has been suspended and fresh copies
are to be published without the offending details.
</P>
<P>
Both Labor and opposition MPs expressed incredulity that the
Home Office did not remove the names from the document when it
received the report more than a week prior to publication.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on Friday that the absence of a
functioning parliament has created a serious institutional vacuum
in Haiti and continues to cause grave concern for the
international community.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council on the United Nations
Civilian Police Mission in Haiti (MIPONUH), Annan calls on all
political actors to pursue constructive and meaningful
negotiations to resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General also reiterated the need for the
formation of a credible Provisional Electoral Council as soon as
possible in order to create the basis for early, free and fair
elections in Haiti before the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no expectation of international assistance,
financial or otherwise, for elections which do not meet the
necessary conditions of transparency and credibility," Annan
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Annan warned that the current political crisis is having
adverse effects on social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
He says without a functioning government and legislature, it is
becoming increasingly difficult to utilize international
assistance or implement developmental projects.

<HEADLINE> Annan: It is up to Libya to Decide Lockerbie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Friday said that the United Nations has given
Tripoli "all the explanations and clarifications necessary," the
next stage is up to Libya to decide when to turn over the two
suspects for trial in the Lockerbie bombing in December 1988 which
killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the U.N. headquarters on Friday morning,
Annan told reporters, "We have given them all the explanations and
clarifications necessary, so the next stage would be for the
Libyans to decide when the two accused will be turned over for
trial in the Netherlands."
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if they are negotiations, but I have been having
discussions with the Libyan authorities," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief made the statement as the Security Council will
late on Friday begin review on sanctions against Libya, on which
Annan gives briefing to 15 Council members.
</P>
<P>
At issue if the handing over by Libya for trial before a
Scottish court in the Netherlands two suspects in the December
1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, reviewed and extended every 120 days, can be
suspended if the two Libyans arrive in the Netherlands for
trial.The sanctions were imposed in 1992 and toughened in 1993 and
include bans on air travel, weapons, some financial assets, some
types of oil equipment but no oil embargo.
</P>
<P>
A Security Council resolution, adopted in August last year,
calls for an automatic suspension once the two have arrived in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Last August, Libya accepted a proposal from Washington and
London to set up a Scottish court in the Netherlands for the
trial, after the United States and Britain dropped their
insistence that the two should be tried in either of the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Who will Be Next Nigerian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 40 million
registered voters will troop out Saturday to decide who is the
next Nigerian president in the presidential election in the most
populous African country.
</P>
<P>
Former Head of State of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo is the flag
bearer of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) while the alliance
of the All People's Party (APP) and the Alliance for Democracy
(AD) field former Finance Minister Olu Falae as their joint
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Falae who was initially the AD presidential candidate was
chosen by the two parties as their joint candidate on the APP
platform under the guidelines issued by the Independent National
Electoral Commission (INEC) of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The Saturday election is the climax of the transition program
unveiled seven months ago by Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar to hand over power to an elected president on
May 29.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, in his early 60s, is now seen as the strongest
contender to lead the west African country back to civilian rule
and out of poverty, ethnic divisions and widespread corruption.
</P>
<P>
In a country riven by tribalism, Obasanjo who is making a
come-back 20 years after stepping down as a military ruler in 1979
willingly is one of the few politicians who can claim to be more
popular outside than within his own ethnic group of Yoruba.
</P>
<P>
He enjoys the backing of many in the Hausa-speaking North who
has dominated the Nigerian government for the past decades and
also enjoys the key support of many retired and serving military
officers in the country which has been ruled by the military
except for 10 years since its independence in 1960.
</P>
<P>
The retired general received international acclamation in 1979
for being the first modern African military leader to hand over
power to civilians voluntarily and adopted the role of world
statesman when he was nominated as one of the candidates of the
United Nations Secretary-General in 1991.
</P>
<P>
However, the military has always been unpopular in Nigeria as
the military rulers have made the country one of the 20 most
backward countries in the world with corruption in the country
placed on top of the global corruption list.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo's critics said, if one judges by the mood of the
nation and the havoc already done to Nigeria by the past military
dictators, it will be difficult for any retired military man to
win the presidency unless by fraud.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, former United States President Jimmy Carter, who
arrived here Thursday as a co-leader of the U.S. observers team,
predicted that the presidential election would be the best of the
elections held under the current on-going transition program in
the country.
</P>
<P>
"My belief is that the overwhelming number of powerful military
leaders in this country are committed to the process of a transfer
of power to a civilian government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo's party of the PDP had easily won the local and state
government elections held last December and January this year
before the AD and the APP joined forces in February to contest in
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Based on the past performance, the combination of the two
parties against the PDP provides an opportunity for a keen contest
in which the scale of victory could tilt either way.
</P>
<P>
Although the PDP remained the lead in the National Assembly
election held on February 20, issues like anti-military sentiments
and perceived marginalization of some sections of the country may
influence the pattern of voting on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Following the defeat of presidential aspirant Alex Ekwueme who
belongs to Igbos at the PDP national convention, the votes of
Igbos from the Southeast of the country which is the third largest
clan in Nigeria, may become a major factor in determining who
emerges winner of the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
If the Igbos make good their threat to back Falae, Obasanjo's
rival, in protest over Ekwueme's defeat, the outcome of the
election may not be in favor of the PDP.
</P>
<P>
People in Nigeria and the world are keenly waiting to find out
who will win in Saturday's presidential election which in turn
will lead the most populous African country to civilian rule.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Join Int'l Peace Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa would join
international peace operations if it is authorized by
international and domestic authorities, the South African
government said in a white paper released Friday.
</P>
<P>
South Africa might provide armed forces, police and civilian
assistance for international peace missions because it is clearly
in the interest of the country, South African Press Association
quoted the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the country would not deploy its national military force
without a clear international mandate, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The army's participation would not exceed one infantry
battalion, it added.
</P>
<P>
According to the white paper, which was endorsed by the South
African cabinet last October, the level and size of any
participation in a peace mission would depend on how closely it
relates to South Africa's interests.
</P>
<P>
If needed, South Africa would also send voluntary services,
including personnel specializing in de-mining, conflict
resolution, election monitoring and medical care.
</P>
<P>
The government would create a resource bank of competent
personnel so that they would be quickly dispatched for
international assignments when needed, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The South African defense force would cooperate with the United
Nations in determining personnel and equipment which would be sent
to peace missions.

<HEADLINE> Angola's War-Disabled Kids Treated in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan Action for
Development, a non-governmental organization (NGO), said Friday
that 144 war-disabled Angolan kids were in line with a children's
program sent to Germany for surgical treatment and recovery in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Domingas Goncalves who is in charge of the children's program
revealed here that 117 kids who had been treated in Germany
returned to Angola last year.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the NGO will send 49 more kids who had been made
disabled in the civil war to Germany for cure this year.
</P>
<P>
The children's program is a joint project sponsored by the
Angolan Action for Development and a German NGO Friends Dorf
International, which selects Angolan children under 12 years who
had been handicapped due to the civil war in the southern African
country and sends them to Germany for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Since the program was implemented five years ago, 697 Angolan
kids have been sent to Germany and 569 of them have returned,
according to Ms. Goncalves.

<HEADLINE> EU Informal Summit Clashes Over Budget Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of European Union
countries gathered here on Friday only to clash over the
long-debated issue of budget reform for the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
The informal summit was called in an attempt to settle sharp
division on farm and financial reform ahead of the bloc's planned
expansion into central and eastern Europe next century.
</P>
<P>
But the one-day meeting was not expected to reach any consensus
as the European Union farm ministers council meeting broke up
earlier in the day in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The reform of EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was one of
the key issues at stake in the Bonn informal summit.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government of the European Union have
set a March 25 deadline to agree on the so-called Agenda 2000
reform package which aims at reforming the union's
100-billion-U.S.-dollar annual budget including aid payments to
farmers and poorer regions.
</P>
<P>
Germany insisted that the EU's annual budget should be
stabilized in real terms at around 100 billion dollars in the
period from 2000 to 2006, which would otherwise cap spending on
agriculture at 44.67 billion dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
France, known as the EU twin development engines alongside
Germany, strongly opposed the budget freeze idea and proposed to
reduce the aid progressively.
</P>
<P>
Germany on Friday did not rule out a study of the French idea
of degressivity but stuck to its co-financing proposal that
requires EU member states to jointly finance their agricultural
sector together with the union.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, some 30,000 farmers from across the EU staged a
demonstration in Brussels to protest against the proposed price
cuts on agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
Another headache for the EU leaders was the financing for the
union's poorer regions.
</P>
<P>
Germany, the largest net contributor toward the EU coffer,
wants to cut the total 2000-2006 budget for regional aid to around
220 billion dollars even though Spain, Portugal, Greece and
Ireland have rejected the plan by the European Commission to trim
the regional aid.
</P>
<P>
Britain also caused bitter rows at the informal summit with its
rebate. Several member states want Britain to give ground on its
annual 2-billion-pound (please convert thanks) rebate on its
contribution toward the EU budget.
</P>
<P>
The rebate was won back by former British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
Germany and France are among those who want to see the British
rebate cut or scrapped.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders tried hard to find a framework for the current
negotiations which are expected to end in the form of a reform
agreement to be signed up in the EU summit slated for later next
month in Berlin.

UNITED NATIONS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Friday decided to extend the mandate of the
United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic until
November 15, 1999.
</P>
<P>
In its resolution unanimously adopted, the Security Council

</P>
<P>
The Council strongly reaffirmed that the complete
implementation of the Bangui Agreement and of the National
reconciliation pact is essential to peace and national
reconciliation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Council urged the Government of the Central African
Republic to continue to take concrete steps to implement
political, economic, social and security reforms it promised.
</P>
<P>
The Council called upon all parties in the country, with the
assistance of the special representative of the U.N.
Secretary-General, to take the necessary measures to resolve the
current political impasse, with a view to enhancing the national
reconciliation process.

<HEADLINE> Israel Promises Speedy Trial for American </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, Februay 26 (Xinhua) - In an effort to soothe
anger and disappointment of U.S. officials, Israeli Justice
Minister Tsahi Hanegbi promised Friday a speedy trial for an
American Jewish teenager suspected of murder, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the 18-year-old
Samuel Sheinbein, who is suspected of killing an acquaintaince in
Maryland state in September 1997 before fleeing to Israel, should
face trial in Israel instead of being extradited to the
U.S. because he holds an Israeli citizenship by birth.
</P>
<P>
"Since the decision of the Supreme Court, the state of
Israel will poll all the necessary resources in order for
there to be a speedy and effective trial," Hanegbi told the
radio.
</P>
<P>
But he also said that it is nearly impossible to carry
out justice and the trial will involve unusually high costs
since the crime was committed in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Israeli state prosecutors said the trial will begin as
early as next week.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and other officials expressed
disappointment over the ruling of the Israeli Supreme Court, but
said they will assist Israeli courts in the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Sheinbein claimed Israeli citizenship through his father, who
was born in a pre-state Israel but settled in the U.S. in
1952. Israeli laws bar citizens of Israel from being handed
over to foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
But a lower court, the Jerusalem District Court, ruled last
September that Sheinbein is subject to extradition since he
had never lived in Israel before he fled here and thus does
not remain a close tie with the country.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court overturned the lower court decision by a
narrow margin of 3-2. Israeli Prime Minister's Office and the
Foreign Ministry quickly called on Washington to accept the
ruling of the Supreme Court, saying the court works
independently and apolitically.
</P>
<P>
Senior diplomatic officials in the Foreign Ministry, however,
have expressed concern that this case may strain Israel's ties
with the U.S., its closest ally, Israel Radio said.

<HEADLINE> W. African States to Survey Marine Resources in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A team of marine scientists from
six west African countries Friday set sail aboard a fishing vessel
in Lagos for a month-long survey of the state of fishery resources
and pollution in the Gulf of Guinea.
</P>
<P>
The expedition flagged off by Nigerian Minister of Agriculture,
Water Resources and Rural Development, Alhaji Alfa Wali, is being
undertaken by scientists from Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Benin,
Cameroun, Togo and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The survey project sponsored by the United Nations Industrial
Development Organization (UNIDO) is aimed at assessing and
mitigating ecosystem pollution, protecting human health and
ensuring the sustainability of living resources.
</P>
<P>
The survey is expected to cover 92,300 square kilometers of
continental shelves of the six countries and work the depth range
of 10 to 100 meters, generating water samples and sediments for
pollution studies.
</P>
<P>
Analysis of the fishery samples will be carried out in Lagos of
Nigeria while the pollution level analysis is expected to be made
in Abidjan of Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the flag-off ceremony, the Nigerian minister said
that the last fishery resources stock assessment survey of inshore
waters of Nigeria was conducted more than 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
He added that the development had led to arguments by
scientists as to the correct state of the nation's marine fishery
resources.
</P>
<P>
He said that the fishing industry in the country had complained
of marked reduction in mean sizes of fish species as well as
quantity of catch per unit effort.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the Nigerian government had in 1997
promulgated the sea and inland fishery decree to regulate fishing
activities in the nation's territorial waters, the exclusive
economic zone as well as rivers, lakes and dams.

<HEADLINE> Young Enterpreneurs Urged to Back E. A. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Young enterpreneurs in the
East African region have been urged to be shrewd, disciplined and
sober in carrying out their business activities in order to ensure
success.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by President Yoweri Museveni when he opened
the first regional conference of the East African Enterprise
Network here Friday afternoon, a press release from the
President's Office said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech delivered at the conference attended by delegates
from Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia, Rwanda and Burundi,
Museveni said that the enterpreneurs should fully support all
efforts aimed at regional integration because this is where the
future of Africa lies.
</P>
<P>
The crucial thing lacking in the region has been
enterpreneurship, he explained.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the young enterpreneurs now coming up are
uniquely placed to advance the business of their predecessors who
were pioneers in commerce and industry.
</P>
<P>
The president urged them to emphasize efficiency in their
enterprises by minimizing costs while maximizing profits in all
their operations.
</P>
<P>
Lack of infrastructure, macro-economic instability,
interference in the economy by the state, lack of credit, small
markets, corruption and slowness in decision-making by government
are the main obstacles hindering economic growth in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said the Ugandan government has done a lot to improve
infrastructure and the environment for investment, pledging that
the government will continue to do this in the future.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Foreign Affairs Amama Mbabazi assured the
young businessmen that the government is committed to facilitating
and strengthening the private sector in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said significant progress has been made in harmonizing
policies in the region in a move to create one large market.

In the supermarket like Circuit City, even lower prices can be

450MHz processors inside, sell at 1599.99 dollars after an instant
discount of 260 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Pentium III has 70 new instructions on the chip which will
boost multimedia performance, in particular 3-D, full-motion video
and voice processing.
</P>
<P>
It may appeal most to gamers, with other computer buyers
looking for bargains as Intel, the world's largest maker of
microprocessors for personal computers, slashes the prices of its
Pentium II chips. Others may want to wait till next year for the
one-gigahertz version, double the speed of the 500MHz Pentium III
chip on sale from today.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Defense Minister Kundi
Payama Friday issued a decree Friday which orders to enlist
soldiers from the Angolan youths living abroad.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued by the Angolan Defense
Ministry, the government has notified its diplomatic missions
abroad of the decree and asked them to encourage the Angolan
youths at the age of 20 to 22 years to return and join the Angolan
army.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government declared on January 11 this year that
the age for recruitment was lowered from 20 years to 18 at home.
</P>
<P>
Since civil war renewed in the country last November, the
Angolan government troops had fought many fierce battles against
the forces of the rebel National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) in central highlands and northern parts of the
southern African country.

<HEADLINE> Romania, Switzerland Hope A Lasting Solution to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Romania and Switzerland
still hope that at the future negotiations an immediate, good
solution will be found and, on a long term, a solution making
impossible the continuation of this series of crisis, Romanian
Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu said on Friday after talks with his
Swiss counterpart Flavio Cotti.
</P>
<P>
Cotti asserted that there was a unanimity of views between
Romania and Switzerland as concerns the settling down of the
crisis in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Besides the "hot regional issues", the parties analyzed the
unfolding, until this moment, of the support the Swiss
Confederation granted and grants to Romania and the East-European
states as well as its prospects, as there is a Swiss program of
support of these countries.
</P>
<P>
The topic of Romania's candidacy to the OSCE Presidency for the
year 2001 was also discussed. Switzerland promised to grant
Romania "unconditional support".
</P>
<P>
Cotti confirmed that Switzerland fully supported Romania's
candidacy for the OSCE Presidency in 2001 and estimated that this
would be very important, especially when taking into account
Romania's geographical position, near some main conflict areas
within the OSCE zone.
</P>
<P>
Flavio Cotti, the head of Switzerland's Department for Foreign
Affairs, arrived here Friday for an official visit of a few hours
in Bucharest. This is his third visit within six years.

<HEADLINE> Study Links Surgery to Higher Risk of CJD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Surgery could be linked to
higher risk of contraction of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), the
fatal, degenerative brain disease, Australian doctors said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a report published in The Lancet medical journal, doctors
from the University of Melbourne said they have found that a range
of surgical treatments may account for a proportion of cases of
sporadic CJD, the classic form of the disease.
</P>
<P>
CJD comes in several forms. The most common is sporadic CJD
that mainly affects elderly people and accounts for between 85 and
95 percent of the disease worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Another type is called variant CJD, which is linked to mad cow
disease and is specific to the UK.
</P>
<P>
The cause of sporadic CJD is still not known, but the new
Australian research sought to isolate some risk factors.
</P>
<P>
The doctors studied 241 definite and probable cases of CJD and
compared them with 784 healthy volunteers, and their main finding
was that there was a significant association between surgical
procedures and the development of sporadic CJD.
</P>
<P>
This risk increased with the number of surgical treatments and
the greatest risk factor was for people who had more than three
operations including hysterectomies and heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
The other factors included living or working on a farm or
market garden for more than 10 years. However, people who worked
in butchers shops or abattoirs were not at any greater risk.
</P>
<P>
And blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and major dental
work were not linked to risk of sporadic CJD.
</P>
<P>
The findings "should reinforce the heightened vigilance about
infection control at all levels of care in hospital settings," the
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
They also suggested that the results could have implications
for risk factors of variant CJD, which is caused by eating beef
infected with mad cow disease.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Grows at Rapid Pace in Final Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. gross domestic product
grew at an annual rate of 6.1 percent in the final three months of
1998, the fastest pace in nearly 15 years, the Commerce Department
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The growth in GDP had been originally reported at 5.6 percent
for the fourth quarter. This upward revision reflected a slightly
better performance in trade than originally thought.
</P>
<P>
For all of 1998, the Department said, the economy grew 3.9
percent unchanged from its estimate a month ago. That matched the
1998 increased and followed 3.4 percent economic growth in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, the economy has grown at its fastest
pace since the mid 1980s. In December of last year, the country's
economic expansion became the longest in peacetime history.
Economists say it has been three decades since the country has
enjoyed the current good mix of rapid economic growth, low
unemployment and low inflation.
</P>
<P>
However, all forecasters are predicting economic growth will
slow significantly in 1999 although so far there are no signs of
that occurring. Most analysts believe GDP growth this year will be
between 2.5 percent and 3 percent as the red-hot consumer sector
slows a bit and a rising trade deficit takes more of a bite out of
the manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of total
economic activity, rose 4.8 percent in 1998, the fastest increase
in 14 years.
</P>
<P>
Strong growth in domestic demand offset the one dark spot for
the economy at present, a record trade deficit as U.S. farmers and
manufacturers face dwindling export markets overseas while imports
made cheaper by foreign currency devaluations flood into the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The quarterly pattern of growth in 1998 showed a 5.5 percent
GDP rate in the first quarter followed by a big drop to 1.8
percent in the second quarter, then 3.7 percent in the third
quarter and the 6.1 percent in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
The 6.1 percent advance was the largest quarterly GDP increase
since a 6.4 percent growth rate in the second quarter of 1984.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Warns Arms Row Could Damage N.Irish Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A Sinn Fein leader warned on
Friday that pressure for IRA to disarm could cause irreparable
damage to Northern Ireland's fragile peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mitchel McLaughlin, chairman of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political
wing, told BBC radio that those "who are now demanding prior
decommissioning before we move to setting up the executive are
reneging on the Good Friday Agreement."
</P>
<P>
"I think by the time those people realize that the IRA are not
going to be forced to decommission, they will have in the meantime
irreparably damaged the Good Friday Agreement," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Irish Republican Army (IRA) has been holding to a truce in
its war against British rule since July 1997.
</P>
<P>
But with no sign of a breakthrough on disarmament, Sinn Fein
and pro-British Unionist parties are on a collision course that
could disrupt the launch of structures agreed in last year's peace
agreement aimed at ending 30 years of strife in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Britain wants to give its province a large measure of home-rule
starting on March 10, but Protestant Unionists say they will not
sit in a ruling 10-minister executive with the Catholic Sinn Fein
unless the IRA gives up -- "decommissions" -- arms to prove that
the guerrillas' ceasefire is meant to be permanent.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Cyprus Makes New Diplomatic Efforts on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government recently
launched a diplomatic offensive in a bid to push for more pledges
and concrete actions from the international community to deal with
the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides, now on a two-week tour in
the United States, held a series of meetings with U.S. and
U.N. officials, including United Nations Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
He also met with the U.S. Presidential Emissary for Cyprus
Richard Holbrooke, and several U.S. congressmen. All the meetings
centered on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Kasoulides also briefed overseas Cypriots on
recent developments in Cyprus and exchanged views on how they can
help promote future U.S. efforts to solve the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated Cyprus
Republic in the south, recognized by the international community,
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north, only backed by Turkey,
since 1974 when Turkey landed its troops and took over the
northern third of the island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens
coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation formula, but so far no
tangible results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Kasoulides had talks in Brussels with the
European Union (EU) Commissioner for Foreign Affairs Hans Van den
Broek and other EU officials.
</P>
<P>
After he left Brussels, Kasoulides flew to Athens for talks
with the then Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos and
members of the leadership of the Greek Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides will also see German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer on March 15, now that Germany is holding the six-month
rotating presidency of the EU
</P>
<P>
Cyprus hopes to "make the most out of the increased
international interest," the government said.
</P>
<P>
According to government spokesman Christos Stylianides, the
effort has three aims: to persuade the Turkish side to return to
the negotiating table, to unleash the process of demilitarization
on the island, and to ensure a smooth course leading to Cyprus' EU
accession.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides also said the foreign ministry will seek "concrete
steps, concrete actions" from the international community.
</P>
<P>
But news reports showed that although the U.N. and the
U.S. officials are interested in a solution on Cyprus, they
insist that they should not act before the April elections in
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots and Turkey, who have been a long-time rival of
Greek Cypriots, vehemently oppose the admission of Cyprus into the
EU before Turkey, another EU membership applicant, arguing that it
will amount to the island joining Greece, already an EU member.
</P>
<P>
Both in Brussels and in New York, Stylianides expressed the
hope that an international force be deployed on the island under a
U.N. Security Council mandate, replacing the armed forces both of
the Cyprus Republic and the Turkish Cypriot areas.
</P>
<P>
So far there is no report about the reactions from the E.U. and
the U.S. on this idea.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, since the beginning of the year, Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides has had numerous meetings with visiting foreign
politicians, from whom the Cypriot government has got assurance
for supporting a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation formula on
Cyprus issue.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Tries to Develop Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LUSAKA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Tourism Minister Anosh
Chipawa said Friday that Zambia's tourism sector will take time to
develop to standards prevailing in southern African countries and
other countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to parliament, Chipawa said that lack of funds, poor
infrastructure and accommodation and lack of a vigorous
advertising campaign within Zambia and abroad are among the
bottle-necks the tourism sector was facing.
</P>
<P>
However, Chipawa described the tourism sector as " the
industry of the next millennium", saying that the sector can
become a major foreign exchange earner if its potential is fully
exploited.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia's tourism sector earned the country 89.8
million U.S. Dollars in 1998, a 19 percent increase over the 1997
earnings.
</P>
<P>
Winding up debate on the estimates of expenditure for the
Tourism Ministry, Chipawa said that investment in the sector had
increased to 1.67 billion Kwacha (about one million Dollars) in
1998 and created 704 jobs in the country.
</P>
<P>
While Zambia had a comparatively great potential in tourism,
the country will continue to lag behind due to poor funding and
poor infrastructures, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Chipawa challenged the Zambia National Tourism Board to start
generating its own funds and intensify the promotion of the
country's tourism attractions worldwide in order to attract more
tourists and investment.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Decides to Pull out U.N. Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Friday unanimously decided to withdraw U.N.
peacekeeping mission from Angola following the U.N. failure to
persuade the Angolan Government into accepting limited U.N.
political and military presence in the southwest African country.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Council made the decision in a resolution adopted
unanimously to support a proposal by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan to shut down the peacekeeping operations of the United
Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA) by March 1999.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council on Thursday, Annan said,
MONUA, except for some necessary personnel in administrative,
logistical and medical fields, will have its remaining military,
police and civilian personnel repatriated by the end of March
1999.
</P>
<P>
"The technical liquidation of MONUA and its predecessors, whose
combined presence in Angola spans a period of almost 10 years,
presents a significant challenge to the Organization," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"This task, which may take over six months to complete, will
demand the presence in Angola of a substantial number of
administrative, logistical and other personnel, as well as a small
medical unit," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, it will require the retaining, for a period of up
to two to three months after the mandate ends, of about 30 staff
and a dozen police officer who would assist in the liquidation,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the remaining military, police and civilian personnel
would be repatriated by end of March 1999," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council decided on June 30, 1997 to send MONUA
into Angola to monitor the peace process in the country. The
peacekeeping mission, currently with 654 members, ends its mandate
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
An Angolan Government delegation is in New York to shed more
light on the Luanda demand that MONUA leave after its mandate
expires.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of fighting broke out in December 1998,
breaking down a 1994 peace accord to end years of civil war in the
diamond-rich African country.

<HEADLINE> Internatonal Red Cross Warns Against Cholera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A relief agency Friday called
for more efforts in preventing cholera outbreaks in Kenya, citing
that the situation that causes cholera still remains in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Despite strenuous interventions, future outbreaks of cholera
are inevitable in Kenya, the International Federation of Red
Cross and Red Crescent Societies warned.
</P>
<P>
It is no longer difficult to tell where and when it will break
out and the only unpredictable thing is its intensity, the agency
alleged.
</P>
<P>
The comments came as the Kenya Red Cross Society delivered
medical supplies to Coast Province's Kwale District where the
cholera toll has been rising and the authorities reported that
1,200 affected people have sought medical care.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Red Cross branch coordinator, Kennedy Gesira, fears the
true figure may have been considerably higher. He said the fact
that some people have to walk from remote areas prevents many
from reaching health centers.
</P>
<P>
Cholera is now endemic to east Africa, and the Kenya Red Cross,
supported by the federation, is intensifying a campaign to train
health workers that in Nyanza Province alone has trained 3,000
community health workers in order to increase public awareness.
</P>
<P>
Head of the federation's regional delegation, Al Panico, said
poor hygiene, a lack of clean water and proper sanitation,
environmental pollution and wide-spread ignorance of the disease
have contributed to its spread.

<HEADLINE> PM: Bright Future Ahead for Sino-Russian Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
here Friday that Sino-Russian trade and economic cooperation will
advance to a brand new level as long as both sides work together
to give full play to advantages in their complementary economies.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, addressing a luncheon with about 100 Russian business
leaders, expressed confidence that such cooperation will be
further strengthened under the bilateral strategic partnership of
cooperation based on equality and mutual trust and oriented toward
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier is here on a four-day official visit, his
first to Russia since assuming premiership last March.
</P>
<P>
He met Thursday with Russian President Boris Yeltsin and held
the fourth regular meeting between the premiers of the two
countries together with his Russian counterpart, Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said President Yeltsin's remarks on the bright future of
bilateral trade and economic cooperation will give a fresh impetus
to the development of such cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The premier said his cordial, candid and substantial talks with
Primakov also yielded broad consensus on cooperation in various
areas, especially in economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed 11 documents on oil, natural gas,
electricity, transportation and regional cooperation at the end of
the premiers' meeting.
</P>
<P>
Friday's luncheon was hosted by Russian First Deputy Prime
Minister Yuri Maslyukov.
</P>
<P>
He said Zhu's visit has been a complete success as both sides
have settled many problems and opened up cooperation in such new
areas as direct investment, joint production of household electric
appliances and distribution of consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu said Russia commands top superiority in high-tech
areas such as space and that as long as the two sides trust each
other and strengthen cooperation, such superiority will lay a good
foundation for the speedy growth of economic and trade
collaboration.
</P>
<P>
He said the two premiers have reached sincere understanding in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
Zhu left Moscow later Friday for St. Petersburg, Russia's
second largest city, where he was scheduled to meet Governor Igor
Yakovlev and tour the local Izhorskiye Zavody machine-building
factory.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Isolate Superbug in Chicken Feed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists reported Friday
they have isolated so-called superbug bacteria in chicken feed
that is resistant to several important and much-used antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
The findings "raise serious issues about the risk of transfer
of these pathogens to man," Richard Schwalbe and colleagues from
the University of Maryland, Baltimore, said in a research letter
to The Lancet medical journal.
</P>
<P>
The investigators reported that after testing several samples
of commercially prepared chicken feed from one bag, they
identified the same resistant enterococci in all of them.
</P>
<P>
The enterococci was found resistant to antibiotics as
vancomycin, streptomycin, and ampicillin. Enterococci, which
causes intestinal problems, is a major source of hospital-acquired
infection in Europe and the U.S. and usually treated with
antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the drug-resistant enterococci in animal feed
means it could be transferred to animals and to humans, the
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
"The presence of multiple isolates within the same bag suggests
that there was widespread contamination by vancomycin-resistant
enterococci of at least one production lot of feed," they wrote.

<HEADLINE> British Envoy Reiterates Support of Peaceful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 26 (Xinhua) -- British envoy Tony Lloyd, who
was on a visit to Rwanda, reiterated his country's support of a
peaceful solution to the conflict in the the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Tony Lloyd, special envoy of British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, made the remarks during his meeting with Rwandan president
late Thursday evening as he continued with his African tour.
</P>
<P>
He had come to the region to express Britain's concern over the
bloody civil war tearing apart the the DRC, the Rwanda News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
''All this concerns us. As a friend, Britain is committed to
working with Africa to build peace and prevent conflict,'' a press
release by the British Embassy in Kigali, capital of Rwanda,
quoted Lloyd as saying.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the talks, Lloyd told reporters that Britain
cannot interfere with the African initiative, but stands ready to
throw all its weight behind all efforts being deployed to broker
a peace deal in the Congolese conflict which is causing great
losses in both human lives and material.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts here believe that Lloyd's visit to the region
will not change the status quo prevailing about the peace process
in the DRC stalled by the refusal to include the rebels in the
talks.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government insisted that it will not pull out its
troops out of the DRC unless a solution is found to thousands of
Hutu extremists who have been regrouped and rearmed by President
Laurent Kabila in order to invade Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
''As long as this is not solved, we will not pull our troops
out of Congo," Patrick Mazimhaka, Rwandan Minister in the
President's Office, told reporters soon after Lloyd left for
Kampala, Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Tony Lloyd's meeting with Rwandan government officials is part
of a nine- country African tour to try to add Britain's weight to
efforts to broker a peace deal in Congo.

<HEADLINE> EU Budget Reform Running Short of Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder assured on Friday that the planned European Union summit
in June would not be postponed though some fear the union's budget
reform would not be completed by then.
</P>
<P>
The chancellor, whose country is holding the six-month rotating
presidency of the 15-nation bloc, told the press after a one-day
informal meeting of the EU heads of state and government that he
was not thinking of postponing the June summit.
</P>
<P>
He said that any thought of a postponement could send out "a
signal that no agreement could be reached in the March summit" on
the budget reform program.
</P>
<P>
He described the postponement of the June summit as triggering
a "logistical difficulty" to the scheduled reforms of the European
Union, both politically and structurally, known as the Agenda
2000.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders gathered here Friday to try sorting out their
divisions concerning the thorny issue of budget reforms that would
lead to decreases of aid to the agricultural sector and to the
poorer regions of the union.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Santer, president of the European Commission, said at
the joint press conference with Schroeder that the participants of
the Bonn informal summit all showed a political will to reach an
agreement by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
"All the member states agreed that a well-balanced long-term
compromise could be reached in the end," said the chancellor,
"though everybody was disappointed by the failure of the mandate
by EU farm ministers."
</P>
<P>
EU funding to agriculture is the key to reaching an agreement
on EU budget reform, in that the 15-nation bloc spends almost half
of its annual budget on subsidizing agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The farm ministers council meeting broke off earlier on Friday
after a four-day marathon negotiations failed to bring the annual
agricultural subsidy to within the EU projection of 40.5 billion
euro (44.55 billion U.S. dollars). The ministers are to resume

<HEADLINE> No Going Back on Land Issue: Zimbabwean President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe reiterated Friday that nothing will stand in the
government's way to acquire more than five million hectares of
land on which to resettle thousands of people crammed in barren
communal lands.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the land issue was critical to the economic
empowerment of Zimbabwean people as the country's population was
enjoying political independence when they did not have economic
power.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a rally in Mashonaland West Province, north
Zimbabwe, Mugabe said: "The land issue is going ahead as planned.
 Nothing will stand in our way to acquire land."
</P>
<P>
"We want more farms to be designated for resettlement," the
president said as he urged the whites who understood the
government's position to explain to their counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe accused the independent and international media of
failing to understand the land reform in Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwe
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The international media had been labelling him Black Hitler,
Black Napoleon, tyrant and dictator, he said, denying allegations
that he had bought a mansion in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mugabe said the financial problems the country is
facing are due to low metal prices on the world market and poor
fetched by last season's tobacco crop.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government will arrest journalists who write
lies about the leadership, adding there is now some uncertainty
among supporters of the Zimbabwe African National Union -
Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) in the ruling party due to criticism the
government is facing.
</P>
<P>
"Unity is what we need," he said, adding, "We had bigger
problems than this before independence when we had to go and fight
for the country."
</P>
<P>
He said the new opposition Zimbabwe African People's Union
(ZAPU) 2000 is causing disunity among the Ndebele, one of the two
major nationalities in Zimbabwe, by castigating the Unity Accord
between ZANU (PF) and ZAPU of 1987.

<P>
LUSAKA, Febuary 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba will go to Uganda Saturday to have talks with President
Yoweri Museveni as part of his efforts to end the six-month war in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who has been mediating the conflict with a mandate of
Southern African Development Community (SADC), will travel to
Rwanda after talks with Museveni to have similar discussion with
Rwandan leaders, a spokesman of the Zambian Foreign Ministry said
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
For a regional summit to be convened as early as possible in
Lusaka to secure a truce in DRC, Chiluba has been shuttling
between concerned countries. In the past month he has visited
Zimbabwe, DRC, South Africa and Chad.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited Lusaka summit aimed at seeking a peaceful
solution to the crisis in DRC has been postponed several times
from the original date of December 8 of last year due to
disagreement on the presence of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
DRC President Laurent Kabila, who had refused to have direct
talks with the rebels of the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD)
led by Ernest Wamba Dia Wamba, now made a compromise, saying he is
ready to meet the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad have sent troops to the vast
central African country to back Kabila while Rwanda and Uganda
have been accused of backing the rebels although they said they
have deployed their troops in DRC for their own security interests
and accused Kabila instead of backing their anti-government
forces.

<HEADLINE> EU Leaders Appeal for Restraint in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The leaders from European Union
countries appealed on Friday to the conflicting parties in Kosovo
to refrain from further violence before a final peace agreement
could be reached.
</P>
<P>
The EU heads of state and government, meeting in a one-day
informal summit to discuss the union's budget reform, exchanged
views on the latest development of situation in the Yugoslav
province.
</P>
<P>
Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany that is holding
the six-month rotating presidency of the 15-nation bloc, said that
the EU leaders would not expect further violence or abuse of human
rights in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the EU leaders expected that a final peace
agreement could be signed on March 15 so as to facilitate the
implementation of peace in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Renewed fighting reportedly took place in Kosovo after a
conditional accord was reached on Tuesday between the conflicting
parties and the six-nation Contact Group at Rambouillet, France.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Albanian delegates asked to resume the peace talks
on March 15 after they have consulted the proposed peace deal with
their compatriots.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Albanians insisted to have NATO-led peace
implementation troops in Kosovo to guarantee the peace deal while
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia refused to have the NATO troops
in its territory.
</P>
<P>
NATO earlier warned that it still remained ready to use
whatever means necessary to help make peace in the region should
fighting break out again.

<P>
CAIRO, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- The Moroccan government reaffirmed its opposition to
the renewal of the agreement on fishing with the European Union
that expires late this year.
</P>
<P>
However, government spokesman Khaled Eleiwa was quoted by
Al-Hayat as saying the government is not against discussing
another partnership formulas.
</P>
<P>
The fish reserve in the Moroccan fisheries is threatened with
extinction if the current way of fishing by EU boats continues, he
said, adding the maritime environment requires new methods to save
the fishing resources.
</P>
<P>
Morocco is expected to lose up to 150 million U.S. dollars by
2000 when the agreement expires.
</P>
<P>
The E.U.-Moroccan fishing dispute will pose difficulties to
both sides on the eve of the introduction of a partnership
agreement between them early next summer.
</P>
<P>
The partnership envisages compensations to Morocco amounting to
800 million U.S. dollars over 4 years and will lead to the
establishment of a free trade zone between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The total exports of Egypt's potatoes to the EU
countries and to the Arab countries until Thursday hit 70,000
tonnes and 20,000 tonnes respectively, increasing by 60 percent in
contrast to last year's figures.
</P>
<P>
Registered Egyptian exporters were allowed not to stick to
their quotas, Egypt's local daily Al-Ahram Friday quoted Hamed
Mabrouk, a member of the potato export committee as saying.
</P>
<P>
The E.U. approved 4 new areas in Egypt as free from potato
diseases, thus raising the percentage of such areas in the country
to 85 of the desert lands that can export potatoes.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli Electric Corporation is likely to raise
another 400 to 500 million U.S. dollars in bonds in the United
States by the end of the year, the local daily Haaretz reported on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Electric Corp. successfully raised 500
million dollars in a sale of ten-year bonds in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli National Infrastructure Ministry is
seeking a private investor for building a rail line between Tel
Aviv and Kfar Sava, the Jerusalem Post daily reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that it will be the first railroad in Israel
built and operated by a private company.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Meir Shetreet, who was named as Israeli Finance
Minister early this week, intends to accelerate the retraining
programs for 35,000 job seekers of the country, the Jerusalem Post
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Shetreet as saying that fighting unemployment
is among his major objectives in his new job.

<HEADLINE> Iron in Sea Helps Combat Global Warming: Experiment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The first results of an
international experiment have shown that adding iron to the sea
could slow down climate change, the BBC reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The iron significantly boosted the growth of phytoplankton
which in turn absorbed much more of the carbon dioxide gases that
lead to global warming, the research has found.
</P>
<P>
A team of 26 scientists, including nine Britons, has spent
February seeding a 55 sq km patch of the southern ocean with iron
sulphate contained in slurry.
</P>
<P>
The team also includes members from New Zealand, Australia, the
Netherlands, Canada and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The scientists were testing a theory that lack of iron was
holding back phytoplankton growth in Antarctic waters southwest of
New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Dr Murdoch, a New Zealand scientist, said the test so far
showed that phytoplankton not only bloomed extensively, but they
were also responsible for the absorption of a significant amount
of carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
"The growing patch of phytoplankton also produced significant
quantities of gases known to be important in cloud formation," he
was quoted by the BBC as saying.
</P>
<P>
The experiment "provides further evidence to support the theory
that high amounts of iron in the southern ocean and low amounts of
atmospheric carbon dioxide in past ice ages are linked," Dr
Murdoch added.

TEHRAN, February 26 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian helicopter crashed
and caught fire on Friday, killing a passenger and injuring
six others on board, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter crashed after hitting a building at Birjand
airport in northeastern Khorasan province, Governor of Birjand
Mohammad Hossein Tavakkoli said.
</P>
<P>
It is not immediately known whether the helicopter has any
connection with the local elections held on Friday.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian Interior Ministry official said earlier that 40
helicopters were dispatched to send ballot boxes to arduous
regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
The local elections is the first of its kind in the country for
city, town and village councils since the Islamic revolution in
1979.
</P>
<P>
Head of the airport Mohammad Reza Tavazo said the reason
behind the incident is under investigation.
</P>
<P>
The general conditions of most of the injured are
satisfactory, IRNA quoted a hospital source as saying, but one of
them is under special medical care.

Two of the injured have been discharged from the hospital
and three others were treated as outpatient, IRNA added.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Fair Opens in Accra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fair, which was opened by Togolese Premier Kwassi Klutse,
is to give real meaning to the economic objectives of the group
with emphasis on economic development through trade among its 16
nations, reported the Ghana News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The 10-day fair is on the theme: "Economic Integration through
Trade."
</P>
<P>
Records have indicated a low volume of trade among ECOWAS
states, about 10 percent of the trade with Europe.
</P>
<P>
It, therefore, became necessary to sensitise member countries
to boost trade with each other and thus contribute to the
development of the people in the sub-region, said ECOWAS
Secretary-General Lansana Kouyate in his address at the opening
session.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony attracted dignitaries like Vice-President John
Evans Atta Mills and trade ministers as well as senior government
officials from Ghana and other member countries.
</P>
<P>
Participating are some 615 companies from the sub-region and a
host of others from the international community.
</P>
<P>
Items on display include machinery, agricultural products and
tools, food and beverages, cosmetics, textiles and clothing.
</P>
<P>
Also on the stands are leather products, chemicals and
pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
manufacturers and exhibitors have expressed optimism that the
fair would be a great success.

MAPUTO, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Minister of
Transport and Communications Antonio Fernando Friday appealed to
Portuguese entrepreneurs to invest in the Maputo Development
Corridor which will connect southern Mozambique with the
industrial area of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Fernando made the appeal at a meeting here held by the
Industrial Association of Porto (Portugal) with an aim to
introduce the corridor project and relevant investment policies to
the Portuguese entrepreneurs, the Mozambique News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Mozambican government is working hard to
create favorable environment for foreign investment, which
includes measures to shorten decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
The government also hopes to make the decision-making more
flexible, not only for investment promotion, but also for the
establishment of an investment protection mechanism so as to build
a sense of trust among investors, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Fernando believed that the key to foreign investors' success
in Mozambique is to work jointly with local entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
The main part of the Maputo Development Corridor is to
construct an express highway linking Maputo port in southern
Mozambique and the Witbank industrial area in the northeast of
South Africa. Work on the express highway started in mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique, which had been a Portuguese colony, received a
total of 169 million U.S. Dollars worth of investment from
Portugal between 1985 and 1998.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Waiting for Libyan Decision on Lockerbie, Annan Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has
given all explanations and clarifications to the Libyan
authorities at the request of Tripoli and "we are waiting for
their decision," U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the statement to reporters after briefing the U.N.
Security Council on his exchange with the Libyan authorities on
the handover of the two suspects for trial in the Lockerbie
bombing in December 1988, which killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
"I have indicated to the Council my judgement of giving all
explanations and clarifications that have been demanded by the
Libyan authorities," he said. "We are waiting for their decision."
</P>
<P>
Beginning last fall, a Libyan legal team and a U.N. legal team
"have been working together in clarifying issues related to the
Lockerbie issue," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"Lots of good work has been done by the two legal teams, and I
have good support and constructive help from all the governments
concerned," he said, citing the governments of the United States,
Britain, France, the Netherlands and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Annan said that the United Nations has given Tripoli
"all the explanations and clarifications necessary," and the next
stage is up to Libya to decide when to turn over the two suspects
for trial in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the U.N. headquarters Friday morning, Annan
told reporters, "We have given them all the explanations and
clarifications necessary, so the next stage would be for the
Libyans to decide when the two accused will be turned over for
trial in the Netherlands."
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if they are negotiations, but I have been having
discussions with the Libyan authorities," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief made the statement as the Security Council will
late Friday begin review on sanctions against Libya, on which
Annan gives briefing to 15 Council members.
</P>
<P>
At issue is the handing over by Libya for trial before a
Scottish court in the Netherlands of two suspects in the December
1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain intend to warn Libya Friday that
it has 30 days to hand over two suspects in the Lockerbie bombing.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Libyan permanent representative to the United
Nations, Abuzed Dorda, told reporters that Tripoli prefers to have
the sanctions against it lifted, rather than suspended.
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to have the sanctions lifted, not suspended, so no
country can use the Security Council resolution against our
country in their own interest," Dorda said.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, reviewed and extended every 120 days, can be
suspended if the two Libyans arrive in the Netherlands for trial.
The sanctions were imposed in 1992 and toughened in 1993 and
include bans on air travel, weapons, some financial assets, some
types of oil equipment but no oil embargo.
</P>
<P>
A Security Council resolution, adopted in August last year,
calls for an automatic suspension once the two have arrived in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Last August, Libya accepted a proposal from Washington and
London to set up a Scottish court in the Netherlands for the
trial, after the United States and Britain dropped their
insistence that the two should be tried in either of the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> Women for greater involvement in Credit Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 26 (Xinhua)- - Participants at a national
forum on gender, organised by the Ghana Co-operative Credit
Unions Association have advocated ways to ensure greater female
involvement in the activities and leadership of the association.
</P>
<P>
They have also called for the establishment of a national
gender committee to oversee the formulation and incorporation of
gender sensitive considerations into its programs and policies,
the Ghana News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
These were contained in a 10-point resolution adopted by 35
participants at a forum held at Sunyani on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The resolution noted with dissatisfaction the low level of
female participation in activities of credit unions in the
country, especially at the leadership level.
</P>
<P>
It stressed the need for deliberate efforts to encourage the
female to aspire to leadership positions so that their influence
and concerns could be brought to bear on programs of the
association.
</P>
<P>
The resolution called for the streamlining and
recapitalisation of the existing revolving loan for women which
was set up with the help of the Canadian Credit Union to enable
more women members to benefit.
</P>
<P>
In his closing address, deputy general manager of the
association, Frank Eduah, said that in its determination to
increase women membership, the credit unions have organized the
forum to propose policy changes to address gender issues in the
association.
</P>
<P>
Eduah said the proposals contained in the resolution will be
given serious consideration by the national board of directors of
the association to help address gender inequalities.
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Dwamena, chairman of the National Loans Committee of
the association who chaired the closing ceremony, urged more women
to join credit unions for positive changes in their lives.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Togolese Prime Minister Kwassi
Klutse Friday stressed the importance of international trade as a
recipe for effective development within the Economic Community of
the West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
Klutse expressed regret that member countries of the ECOWAS
are not taking advantage of international trade.
</P>
<P>
As a result, official trade within the sub-region is only 10
percent of total trade.
</P>
<P>
Klutse, who represented Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema
who is the current chairman of ECOWAS, made the remarks at the
opening of the second ECOWAS trade fair in Accra, Ghana, under the
theme "Economic Integration Through Trade", the Ghana News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Six hundred and fifteen companies are attending the fair from
the sub- region in addition to a host of other companies from the
international business community.
</P>
<P>
It is the biggest opportunity to showcase the immense
potentials within the west African region, which is reputed to be
the home of a market of about 250 million people.
</P>
<P>
Klutse described intra-ECOWAS trade as low and asked trade and
investment officials to embark on increasing the volume of trade
between them.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the progressive elimination of the numerous
tariffs and non-tariff barriers which will, in the long run,
result in appearance of a single currency.
</P>
<P>
Klutse mentioned problems associated with re-enforcement of
customs and travelling procedures and urged officials involved to
take the matter up.
</P>
<P>
Ghanaian Vice President John Mills also made similar speech on
trade.
</P>
<P>
Mills urged citizens in the sub-region to intensify efforts to
deal with factors which impede trade in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we need to address those factors that
inhibit trade between the sub-region and the rest of the world,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the challenge for the sub-region is to quicken the pace
of the implementation of measures that are already designed under
ECOWAS Trade Protocols to enhance trade among member countries.
</P>
<P>
Mills put the sub-region's population at 250 million with a
gross domestic product of about 75 billion Dollars, saying it
demonstrates the ability to the demand of a vibrant market.

<HEADLINE> Iron Cooking Pot Helps Cure Anaemia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Cooking food in iron pots could
help reduce anaemia in developing countries, scientists said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Anaemia is the most common nutritional problem in the world and
mainly affects women of child-bearing age, teenagers and young
children.
</P>
<P>
In some developing countries almost 50 percent of women and
children and 25 percent of men suffer from the condition, which is
mainly caused by iron deficiency.
</P>
<P>
Daily iron supplementation is the most common control strategy,
but the long duration of treatment and side-effects can deter
compliance.
</P>
<P>
Writing in The Lancet medical journal, Dr Abdulaziz Adish and
colleagues from Montreal, Canada, suggested that a far simpler,
cheaper and more culturally acceptable strategy is the use of iron
pots to cook food.
</P>
<P>
The researchers undertook a laboratory study of the iron
content of traditional foods cooked in iron pots, and a field
study of the effects of cooking with iron pots on the health and
growth of children in Ethiopian households.
</P>
<P>
In the laboratory study, there was about five times more
available iron in meat and vegetables cooked in iron pots than in
meat and vegetables cooked in aluminium or clay pots.
</P>
<P>
Of 407 children in households randomly assigned either an iron
pot or an aluminium pot, those fed food cooked in iron pots had
higher amounts of haemoglobin in their blood after 12 months than
those fed food cooked in aluminium pots.
</P>
<P>
Children fed food from iron pots also grew more quickly than
the other children, the study has found.
</P>
<P>
Both sets of results support the reintroduction of iron pots
into rural households in developing countries as a strategy to
control iron-deficiency anaemia, the researchers concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- European Stock Markets extended
their losses owing to the downward pressures on Wall Street
Friday.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 ended the day 31.4 points lower, a loss of
0.5 percent, at 6175.1. The index hit an early low of 6156.6 and
touched a 6222.7 high early in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
However, weaknesses in U.S. technology shares offered another
obstacle for the FTSE 100, as the Nasdaq dropped over 1 percent in
New York.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that thin volume on Wall Street had created
additional volatility, with many investors sitting the session out
amid uncertainty over the direction of short term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 leapt over 150-points to set a new all time
closing high of 6307.6, and traders said it was no surprise to see
some falling back after this record breaking week.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Xetra Dax fell 14.59 to close at 4903.96, stung by
Dresdner Bank's tumble after recording disappointing earnings.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the CAC-40 closed down 59.62 to hit 4092.94. French
stocks underperformed, losing 1.5 percent, as investors remain
wary that the U.S. Federal Reserve may soon opt for an interest
rate hike.

<HEADLINE> Study Links Fertility Problem to Testicular Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Men with low fertility are
twice as likely to develop testicular cancer than average, Danish
researchers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dr Henrik Moller and colleagues at the Danish National Research
Foundation have telephone interviewed 514 men with cancer and 720
controls and found that men having fewer children than
statistically expected were at a greater risk of developing
testicular cancer.
</P>
<P>
Their study, published in the British Medical Journal,
concluded that men with low relative fertility have doubled the
risk of testicular cancer than men with normal fertility.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of testicular cancer has increased in the past 50
years. In Denmark the number of cases has risen three-fold. There
is also evidence to suggest that sperm quality has reduced in the
same period, leading to an increase in low fertility.
</P>
<P>
The Danish scientists believed that the same underlying factors
may be responsible for the two trends.
</P>
<P>
One possible factor may be contamination of water supplies by
sex hormones such as oestrogen from the contraceptive pill.
</P>
<P>
Recent research also suggests that a wide range of hormone-like
chemicals found in plastics, packaging and other products may be
linked to a decline in sperm quality.
</P>
<P>
"The most plausible explanation for the association between
subfertility and testicular cancer is the existence of causal
factors that are common in both conditions," the researchers
suggested.
</P>
<P>
And they speculated that these factors may take effect at an
embryonic stage.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Allocates 223 Mln Dlrs to Fight Domestic Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
Friday announced 223 million U.S. dollars in grants to fight
violence against women.
</P>
<P>
"As a society, as a country, as a national family, we don't
have to put up with this kind of abuse, and we will not," Gore
said at a ceremony in the White House.
</P>
<P>
The grants are intended to help communities provide services to
victims and foster collaboration between victims' advocates,
prosecutors, police officers and judges in handling domestic abuse
cases.
</P>
<P>
Gore said 138 million dollars will go to 56 states and
territories to strengthen the criminal justice system's response
to violence against women. States must allocate at least 25
percent of the money to law enforcement, prosecutors and victim
services.
</P>
<P>
An additional 62 million dollars will go to battered women's
shelters through the Department of Health and Human Services, Gore
said. The funding will pay for counseling, legal assistance,
emergency aid such as transportation or meals and referral
services for women and children seeking to escape a violent home.
</P>
<P>
Also, 23 million dollars will go to 32 states and five
territories for coordination of criminal justice efforts against
domestic violence such as creating centralized units of police,
prosecutors and judiciary officials to handle those cases.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Certifies Mexico as Cooperative in Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Friday cited Mexico as a fully cooperating partner in the fight
against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
In a foreign policy address to California business leaders,
Clinton credited Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo, saying he
was "working hard to tackle the corruption traffickers."
</P>
<P>
His announcement set up a potential battle with Republicans in
Congress who, seeking sanctions against Mexico, criticized the
U.S. neighbor for a drop in narcotics seizures and disappointing
record of extradition.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton said: "Mexico is cooperating with us in the
battle for our lives."
</P>
<P>
White House drug policy director Harry McCaffrey, in referring
to Republicans' criticism of Mexico, said on Thursday that
refusing to certify the country as a fully cooperating partner in
the fight against drug trafficking would send an unwise and
wrongheaded political message.
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to work in practical cooperation with men and
women of good will who share our view that this drug threat is a
terrible menace to their own political institutions and their
own children," he said.
</P>
<P>
By U.S. law, the president must judge the performance of all
foreign drug-producing and transiting countries by March. Any
countries not certified as fully cooperating would be hit with
economic penalties by the United States.

WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A former U.S. National
Security Agency intelligence analyst was sentenced Friday to 24
years in prison for selling top-secret documents to the Soviet KGB
for 60,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
David Sheldon Boone, 46, pleaded guilty in federal court in
December to conspiracy to commit espionage.
</P>
<P>
Boone was arrested in a sting operation in which a former
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent posing as a KGB
representative asked him to resume his spying, most of which was
carried out while he was posted in Germany from 1988 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
The documents included material on tactical nuclear weapons
targeting the Soviet bloc and a 300- to 400-page handbook listing
reconnaissance and intelligence-collection systems used by the
U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
Boone put American pilots' lives in danger by selling the
documents, prosecutor Thomas Connolly said.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Government Welcomes NPC Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government said here Saturday evening
that it welcomes the statement made by the Commission of
Legislative Affairs of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC) on the clarification of the Court of Final
Appeals of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee said earlier Saturday that the
statement made by Hong Kong's highest court Friday "is necessary
to clarify its previous abode right judgment".
</P>
<P>
On January 29, the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) ruled that
mainland children born to Hong Kong permanent residents had the
right of abode in the territory, whether or not the parents were
married or they were residents at the time the children were born.
</P>
<P>
The ruling had produced strong repercussions in the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and aroused wide concern in
interior areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
As contents of the January 29 judgment involve the explanatory
right of the Basic Law of the HKSAR and the relationship between
the Central Government and the HKSAR, people of the legal
communities from Hong Kong and the interior areas of the country
have made harsh comments on different occasions.
</P>
<P>
CFA Friday conceded it cannot question the authority of the
NPC and its Standing Committee. Chief Justice Andrew Li said CFA
had agreed to a Hong Kong government request to clarify certain
parts of the controversial ruling giving the right of abode to
mainland children born to HK parents.
</P>
<P>
The court accepts that it cannot query the authority of the NPC
and the Standing Committee which is in accordance with the Basic
Law and procedures therein, he said.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Legal Affairs Commission spokesman said: "We notice the
saying in CAF's decision Friday that the judicial right of courts
in HKSAR is entrusted by the Basic Law which stipulates under
Article 158 the explanatory right of the law is up to the NPC
Standing Committee."
</P>
<P>
While calling the statement a necessary step to clarify the
January 29 judgment of CFA, the spokesman emphasized that the
National People's Congress is the highest state power organ of the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
"The NPC and its Standing Committee will perform its duties
according to the principles of 'one country, two systems' and the
Basic Law of the HKSAR," the spokesman added.

<P>
PYONGYANG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Scientific researchers in
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) have successfully
developed an electron microscope with an amplification of 300,000
times within a short span of six months, the Korean Central News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The microscope has been developed by young researchers relying
on their own efforts, the report said.
</P>
<P>
With it, metals and microbiological cells can be observed and
photographed 300,000 times larger. The state-of-the-art instrument
can also feed micrograph data into computers.
</P>
<P>
The report said the development of the microscope marked the
establishment of the scientific foundation on which the country
could further uplift its state of the art in electrooptics. It
could also help deepen research in such fields as gene engineering,
new material development and micro-processing.
</P>
<P>
The development of the microscope, following the successful
launch of the first man-made satellite last August, will inspire
new confidence and optimism in the Korean people in their efforts
to build a strong nation, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Threats Against Neighbors Detrimental: Egyptian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister
Amr Mousa Saturday criticized Iraq for its recent threats against
its neighbors, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Such threats are very detrimental and would lead to
continuation of the problem and further fuel the regional
crisis," Mousa told reporters during a two-day stopover at Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
"It is not in the interest of anyone that Iraq renewed such
threats, especially when we are trying to salvage the Iraqi people
from the current bad situation in the face of the strict regional
and international policies," he said at Saudi port city of Jeddah.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said on February 14 that Iraq
was capable of attacking Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, both were
accused by Baghdad of harboring air bases for U.S. and British
warplanes to enforce the "no-fly" zones in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its allies imposed the no-fly zones with a
claimed aim of protecting Kurds in the north and Shiites in the
south from attacks by Saddam's troops.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian foreign minister also called on Iraq to "show
understanding" of the Arab position adopted during the Arab
foreign ministers' meeting held in Cairo on January 24.
</P>
<P>
He said his country and all other Arab nations are abiding by
the resolutions issued by the Arab foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
Those resolutions urged Iraq to stop threatening its neighbors
and demanded full Iraqi compliance with international resolutions
related to its invasion and occupation of Kuwait in 1990-1991.

<HEADLINE> Arab Patriotic Festival Opens in Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 27 (Xinhua) -- A two-day Arab patriotic
festival designed to show solidarity with Iraq began in Baghdad
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The festival highlights the slogan that "standing by Iraq
against unjust embargo and the U.S.-British aggression is the holy
pan-Arab duty."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony attended by nearly 1,000
representatives from Arab countries, Iraqi Vice President Taha
Yassin Ramadan said "Iraq has been exposed to various kinds of
brutal conspiracies just to stop its development and to impair its
power."
</P>
<P>
Ramadan stressed the conspiracy intensified after Iraq had got
victories from the eight-year-old war with Iran from 1980-88.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. and British warplanes, which regrettably took
off from Arab territories, were still destroying Iraqi sites and
killing innocents.
</P>
<P>
He was apparently criticizing Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, whose
bases were used by warplanes of the two countries to enforce the
southern no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
Clashes between Iraq and U.S.-British warplanes have almost
become a daily occurrence in the restricted zones since the
mid-December U.S.-British bombardment of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan criticized the no-fly zones imposed on Iraq by U.S-led
western allies following the 1991 Gulf War, saying they were
imposed in contrary to the international law and the U.N. Security
Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan also accused the U.S. officials of persuading others to
accept their abortive policy, saying they were touring the region
to convince locals that they were right to interfere with Iraq's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan said that "the Arab Nation is one body and one spirit
and it can not abandon its sons in Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, Iraqi National Assembly
(parliament) Chairman Saadoun Hammadi, members of the National
Command, Regional Command of the Arab Baath Socialist Party and
some ministers were present at the opening ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Lower Deficit Recorded in HK for 10 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- A deficit of 27.48 billion
HK dollars (3.52 billion U.S. dollars) was recorded in Hong Kong
for the 10 months up to January 31, 1999, the government of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The deficit is 10.57 billion HK dollars (1.36 billion U.S.
dollars) lower than that for the period to December, the
government said, announcing its financial results for the 10
months up to January 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The expenditure for the current fiscal year to date amounts to
193.20 billion HK dollars (24.77 billion U.S. dollars) while the
revenue for the same period is 165.72 billion HK dollars (21.25
billion U.S. dollars), the government said.
</P>
<P>
After taking account of the increase in the net worth of the
Land Fund, the fiscal reserves stood at 438.37 billion HK dollars
(56.20 billion U.S. dollars) at January 31, 1999, a decrease of 19.
18 billion HK dollars (2.46 billion U.S. dollars) compared with
the level at March 31, 1998, the end of the previous financial
year.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said that the improvement in the
finances in January was mainly due to the normal high level of
Salaries Tax receipts during the month.
</P>
<P>
An up to date assessment of the likely deficit for the current
fiscal year will be provided by Financial Secretary Donald Tsang
in his budget speech next Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Calling for More High-degree Graduates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, the provincial
capital of Guangdong in south China, will need about 100,000
graduates with a Master's or Doctor's degree in 2010, according
today's Guangzhou Daily.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, such a high level of education has
played a significant role in the city's economic growth, the city
mayor Lin Shusen was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou's GDP has registered an annual growth rate of 14.33
percent since 1978 when China initiated the policy of reform and
opening up, and since 1992 the city has been ranked among the top
three of the country's ten fastest developing cities.
</P>
<P>
Despite the negative impact of the Asian financial crisis last
year, the city's GDP grew by 13 percent compared to 1997 and the
continuing inflow of qualified personnel from other cities and
abroad will help to keep the growth momentum.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that Guangzhou has entered a significant development
phase in which rapid growth is determined by the quantity and
quality of its professional workforce.
</P>
<P>
The city government and related departments have drawn up a
plan to launch a new mechanism in order to train and attract more
highly qualified people.
</P>
<P>
The city will provide preferential treatment to overseas
graduates, including high salaries, sound research facilities and
residential conditions as well as looking after the education of
their children.
</P>
<P>
A package of other encouraging measures such as a research
bonus will also be introduced.

<TEXT>
<P>
Chengdu, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Le Kha Phieu, general
secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
Vietnam, has stressed that the relationship between Vietnam and
China and their communist parties is enjoying bright prospects.
</P>
<P>
Phieu made the remarks during his visit in southwest China's
Sichuan Province, and pointed out that the summit meeting in
Sichuan's capital of Chengdu in 1990, at which it was decided to
resume relations between the two neighboring nations and their
parties, has an important historical significance.
</P>
<P>
Phieu, who arrived here earlier today was met by Xie Shijie,
secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
He told Xie that his talks with his Chinese counterpart Jiang
Zemin were fruitful, and bilateral ties have become closer since
normalization.
</P>
<P>
Today both countries issued a "Joint Statement", which
clarified the principle of building long-term, stable, future-
oriented, good-neighborly and all-round cooperative relations for
the 21st century, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he expressed his pleasure at visiting the site
of the "Chengdu Summit".
</P>
<P>
Xie briefed the visitor on Sichuan's achievements since reform

</P>
<P>
Phieu said his visit to this renowned province enabled him to
see in person China's great change after reform, especially noting
how people's lives have been improved thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
This demonstrates that the sole choice to develop the economy
and improve people's lives in accordance with China's national
situation is to stick to a socialist course and the principle of
common prosperity, he said.

<HEADLINE> US Urged to Stop Interfering in Other Nations' Internal Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- China today urged the United
States to stop using the so-called human rights issue to meddle in
other countries' internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the section concerning China in the U.
S. State Department's annual human rights report, issued Friday,
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said that the US
government should respect the facts and abide by the norms of
international law.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has always respected the general
purpose of promoting and protecting human rights and basic freedom
in the United Nations Charter and the relevant international human
rights instruments on human rights," Zhang said, adding that China
has constantly made big efforts in that direction.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past half century, especially over the past 20 years
of reform and opening-up, the Chinese government has made great
achievements in improving the people's living standards and human
rights status, and the Chinese people are enjoying their rights in
political, economic, social and cultural fields," she noted.
</P>
<P>
"However, without uttering a single word about cases of serious
human rights violations in its own country, the U.S. government
issued the human rights report directed at other countries, and
fabricated unwarranted charges upon another country's human rights
conditions and made irresponsible comments about their internal
affairs." she added.
</P>
<P>
"This is a typical example of applying dual standards on human
rights issue," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"We hereby express our strong resentment and firm opposition to
the US actions and urge the United States to stop using the
pretext of the human rights issue to interfere in other countries'
internal affairs," she concluded.

<HEADLINE> India Increases Defense Budget by 11 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
proposed to increase its defense budget for 1999-2000 by 11
percent to 456.97 billion rupees (10.88 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Presenting the general budget for the new financial year,
Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha told the lower house of the Indian
Parliament Saturday that the budget of the army was increased with
expenditure going up to 239.249 billion rupees (5.63 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The budget for the navy was increased by 2.23 billion rupees
(52.47 million dollars) to 33.62 billion rupees (791.06 million
dollars) and the air force budget went up by 5.297 billion rupees
(124.64 million dollars) to 60.42 billion rupees (1.42 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to the budget, allocation for defense ordnance
factories has been substantially reduced by more than half to 1.34
billion rupees (31.53 million dollars) for 1999-2000, compared
with more than 2.82 billion rupees (66.35 million dollars) last
year. No reason was given for the reduction.
</P>
<P>
The capital outlay for the defense services went up from 101.87
billion rupees (2.4 billion dollars) in the revised estimates of
1998-99 to nearly 122.30 billion rupees (2.88 billion dollars) for
the coming year.
</P>
<P>
Allocation for defense pensions has been increased from the
revised estimates of 72.7 billion rupees (1.71 billion dollars)
last year to 73.48 billion rupees (1.73 billion dollars) for
1999-2000 to meet additional requirement mainly due to the impact
of annual growth of pensioners.
</P>
<P>
Under the 239.249 billion rupees (5.629 billion dollars)
earmarked for the army, pay and allowances for uniformed personnel
would be 92 billion rupees (2.16 billion dollars), and nearly
11.83 billion rupees (278.35 million dollars) would be for
civilians and 20.68 billion rupees (486.59 million dollars) for
research and development.
</P>
<P>
The 33.62 billion rupees (791.06 million dollars) for the navy
include allocation of nearly 6 billion rupees (141.18 million
dollars) for pay and allowances of uniformed personnel, 4.77
billion (112.24 million dollars) for civilians and 14 billion
(329.41 million dollars) for stores.
</P>
<P>
The air force budget allocates 16.31 billion rupees (383.76
million dollars) for pay and allowances of regular personnel, 2.85
billion rupees (67.06 million dollars) for civilians and about
36.19 billion rupees (851.53 million dollars) for stores,

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Threats Against Neighbors Detrimental: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister
Amr Mousa Sunday criticized Iraq for its recent threats against
its neighbors, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Such threats are very detrimental and would lead to
continuation of the problem and further fuel the regional
crisis," Mousa told reporters during a two-day stopover at Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
"It is not in the interest of anyone that Iraq renewed such
threats, especially that we are trying to salvage the Iraqi people
from the current bad situation in the face of the strict regional
and international policies," he said at Saudi port city of Jeddah.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said on February 14 that Iraq
was capable of attacking Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, both were
accused by Baghdad of harboring air bases for U.S. and British
warplanes to enforce the "no-fly" zones in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its allies imposed the no-fly zones with the
claimed aim of protecting Kurds in the north and Shiites in the
south from attacks by Saddam's troops.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian foreign minister also called on Iraq to "show
understanding" of the Arab position adopted during the Arab
foreign ministers' meeting held in Cairo on January 24.
</P>
<P>
He said his country and all other Arab nations are abiding by
the resolutions issued by the Arab foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
Those resolutions urged Iraq to stop threatening its neighbors
and demanded full Iraqi compliance with international resolutions
related to its invasion and occupation of Kuwait in 1990-1991.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Congress Files Candidates for Polls in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Nepali Congress
(NC) announced here Saturday the list of 203 candidates who will
contest the general elections on May 3 in all the 205
constituencies in the country.
</P>
<P>
Former party chief Krishna Prasad Bhattarai has already been
picked up as the prime ministerial candidate.
</P>
<P>
Bhattarai, 75, will try again this time his luck in the
Kathmandu No. 1 constituency, pitting himself against Man Mohan
Adhikari, the prime ministerial candidate of the ruling Communist
Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML), and Bam Dev
Gautam, general secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal
(Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML).
</P>
<P>
Bhattarai lost there in the past two elections held
respectively on May 12, 1991 and November 15, 1994. But this time,
he will also compete in Parsa No. 1 constituency of central Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Party President and Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala will
contest as well in two constituencies -- Morang No. 1 constituency
and Sunsari No. 5 constituency in eastern Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Others on the list include Vice President Sushil Koirala,
General Secretary Tara Nath Ranabhat, central member and Speaker
Ram Chandra Poudel, central member and former prime minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba and the four sitting ministers from the party.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary Ranabhat said that the party allots 13
tickets to women, short of the 10 percent target promised by
President Koirala but more than the requirement of five percent of
the kingdom's constitution.
</P>
<P>
Former deputy prime minister Miss Shailaja Acharya won the
candidacy, but Prime Minister Koirala's daughter Sujata Koirala,
who has been involved in social work for years and is wishful to
contest the election to the 205-seat House of Representatives,
failed.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali Congress, which aims to win an overwhelming majority
in the polls, becomes the first party to declare all the
candidates nationwide. General Secretary Ranabhat said his party
would not forge alliance with any other party in the polls.
</P>
<P>
The party won a clear majority of 110 seats in the elections in
1991 but lagged behind the CPN-UML with 83 seats in the second
polls in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML has declared its candidates in only 165 of the 205
constituencies, leaving 40 open for possible electoral alliances.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-ML, which broke away from the CPN-UML in March 1998,
has declared its intention to contest the polls in all the
constituencies but has named only 112 candidates.
</P>
<P>
It hopes to ally with other left parties in the remaining
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
The Nepal Sadbhavana Party, the other partner of the
tri-partite government, and the two factions of the National
Democratic Party (RPP) led respectively by former prime ministers
Surya Bahadur Thapa and Lokendra Bahadur Chand, have yet to decide
their candidates.
</P>
<P>
RPP (Thapa) said it is also open to electoral alliances.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission said that about 13.5 million adults
including 6.86 million males and 6.66 million females are eligible
to vote in the polls.
</P>
<P>
However, it has yet to decide on whether to hold the coming
elections in one single day or phase-wise as all the parties
except the NC oppose phase-wise polls.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives was dissolved on January 15.

<HEADLINE> 3 Hezbollah Guerrillas Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Three Hezbollah (Party of God)
guerrillas were killed in south Lebanon in clashes with Israeli
forces, a Hezbollah statement said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed resistance group said the corpses of the
three guerrillas had been taken back from the wadies in the
central sector of the Israeli occupied border zone in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
They were killed during clashes with Israeli forces two days
ago, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
This is the first fatality Hezbollah has suffered since the
start of this year. A total of 40 Hezbollah guerrillas were killed
last year.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened only three days after three Israeli
officers were killed in a Hezbollah ambush in the western Bekaa
Valley in eastern Lebanon. Another five Israeli soldiers were
wounded.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting against Israel's occupation.

<HEADLINE> 23 Iraqi Civilians Injured in U.S.-British Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-three Iraqi civilians
were injured Saturday morning when U.S.-British warplanes
attacked civilian targets in southern Iraq, an Iraqi military
spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as saying
that at 8:15 a.m. local time (0515 GMT) 11 formations of
U.S.-British warplanes from Saudi and Kuwaiti bases violated
Iraq's southern airspace over Misan, Basra, Dhi-Qar, Najaf and
Muthana provinces.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that these planes attacked military and
civilian sites, injuring 23 civilians in Misan province.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi air defense units fired back at the planes and forced
them to flee at 9:38 a.m. local time (0638 GMT), he said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, for the first time since the mid-December
U.S.-British bombardments on Iraq, U.S. and British warplanes
attacked targets in southern suburbs of Baghdad, killing several
civilians and injuring a number of others.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-December attacks, U.S. and British warplanes
patrolling the no-fly zones have been attacking Iraqi military and
civilian targets nearly on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed by the U.S. and its allies in the
wake of the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
Baghdad's suppression.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has insisted that these restricted zones have no
U.N. authorization, and are thus illegal.

because the No.1 state highway which links central and southern
Mozambique and goes through the province has been cut off by water
at at least two points so that some counties have been isolated
from the outside world.
</P>
<P>
However, the governor didn't reveal any information regarding
flooded farms or besieged farmers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports from neighboring Sofala Province said
traffic between its capital city Beira and Save River which
borders the two provinces was also cut off.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Discuss Halt to Operations Against Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Saturday that he will discuss with top army officials
an appeal by abducted Brig. Gen. Victor Obillo to stop military
operations against New People's Army (NPA) rebels.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview in Zamboanga, Mindanao, Estrada said: "We
will discuss this with our military officers. The report (about
the general's appeal) was published just this morning."
</P>
<P>
Obillo reportedly sent a message via a two-way radio from an
NPA hideout Friday, asking the government army to stop its
offensive operations "for considerations far greater than" his
personal safety.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also said he is not bothered by threats of the New
People's Army to kidnap government officials and other persons
close to him.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready. They should not threaten us because we are not
afraid of them and we will never be," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
The government Wednesday suspended peace talks with the New
People's Army following its abduction of Obillo, Capt. Eduardo
Montealto and Police Inspector Roberto Bernal in Mindanao in the
past week.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Estrada said the abductions were "acts of
treachery" and only showed bad faith on the part of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, government programs to address the root
causes of the insurgency, as well as its peace initiatives with
NPA rebels at the local level, will be pursued "even more
vigorously."
</P>
<P>
Estrada also reiterated that he would consider reopening peace
talks with NPA rebels if they release the abducted officers
unharmed.
</P>
<P>
He called on the rebels to lay down their arms and help his
government address the root cause of the insurgency if they are
sincere in their desire to help Filipinos achieve a better life.

<HEADLINE> China, UNESCO and Japan Join Hands to Protect Ancient Palace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, February 27 (Xinhua) -- China, UNESCO and Japan have
successfully completed the restoration work of the first layer
foundation of an imperial palace built more than 1,300 years ago
in Chang'an, the capital of China during the Tang Dynasty (618-907)
.
</P>
<P>
Daming Palace, the largest one in Chang'an, which is now called
Xi'an, was the nerve center of Tang politics when Chang'an was at
its peak as a cosmopolitan city with residents of many ethnic
backgrounds. Its main focus was the Hanyuan Hall where state
rituals and important ceremonies including diplomatic exchanges
were carried out.
</P>
<P>
The Daming Palace was burnt to the ground during a war in 886
after two centuries of continual restoration. It is located in the
northeastern district of today's Xi'an whose center is the ruins
of Hanyuan Hall, a 200-meter-long, 100-meter-wide and 15- meter-
high earth base.
</P>
<P>
However, the onslaught of natural elements and the negative
effects of human activities such as rapid urbanization was posing
a threat to the remains of the hall.
</P>
<P>
In order to preserve the site as a permanent legacy for future
generations as well as a field history museum giving direct access
to ancient Chinese civilization, UNESCO and China inked the action
plan in July 1995 to launch the restoration project sponsored by
the Japanese Trust Fund for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage.
</P>
<P>
A sum of two million U.S. dollars was invested in the whole
project and restoration work of the first layer foundation was
completed at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 representatives from China, UNESCO and Japan met
Friday in Xi'an to evaluate the completed work and discuss future
arrangements.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Standing
Committee of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) started to
deliberate three drafts and another three reports submitted to
the eighth meeting of the standing committee today.
</P>
<P>
This afternoon China's top legislator Li Peng, who is Chairman
of the NPC Standing Committee, listened to discussions in the
third group on the drafts.
</P>
<P>
Most of the members focused on the draft agenda of the second
session of the Ninth NPC and the work report of the NPC Standing
Committee in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Nie Li commented that the standing committee made great
achievements in 1998, with progresses in legislation research and
supervision on the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's
Procuratorate.
</P>
<P>
Gu Jinchi suggested that all members of the standing committee
should take part in lectures on understanding the law while Zhu

</P>
<P>
The President of the Supreme People's Court and the Procurator-

<HEADLINE> Two More Arrests Made in Ireland Over Omagh Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 27 (Xinhua) - Two more people were arrested by
Irish police on Saturday in connection with last August's bombing
at Omagh, which killed 29 people in the single worst atrocity in
Northern Ireland's sectarian conflict.
</P>
<P>
The pair, one in his mid-twenties and the other in his mid-
thirties, were held by Irish Republic detectives at Dundalk, close
to the Irish Republic's border with the British-ruled north.
</P>
<P>
"Two men were arrested in the Dundalk area sometime after 7 o'
clock (0700 GMT) this morning in connection with the ongoing
investigation into the Omagh bombing," the Reuters quoted an Irish
police spokeswoman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, 13 men were detained in carefully coordinated
raids on both sides of the frontier. One of them became the first
person to be charged in connection with the bombing earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
The Omagh attack was the work of a radical dissident republican
faction, "the Real Irish Republic Army," aimed at derailing the
province's fragile peace process.
</P>
<P>
Faced with a security crackdown and public outrage, the faction
called off hostilities soon after the attack.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian, German Firms Sign Defense Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian company PSC-ND
Sdn Bhd Saturday picked German Naval Group (GNP) to help it supply
new patrol boats to the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN).
</P>
<P>
PSC-ND and GNP signed here Saturday a contract for the
cooperation in the presence of Malaysian Defense Minister Abang
Abu Bakar Mustapha.
</P>
<P>
PSC-ND signed a contract worth 5.35 billion ringgit (1.407
billion U.S. dollars) with the government on September 5 last year
to replace the navy's patrol boats, many of which are in the
process of being phased out because they are no longer economical
to maintain.
</P>
<P>
The government's contract involves the construction of 27
off-shore patrol boats in Lumut, about 290 kilometers northwest
from here.
</P>
<P>
GNP will help PSC-ND build six patrol boats which would be
equipped with state-of-the-art technologies with the first boat to
be delivered in 56 months and the rest within eight years.
</P>
<P>
The patrol boats, each 90-meter-long and equipped with helipad,
will have a speed of 22 knots.
</P>
<P>
Abang Abu Bakar said on the occasion that the government's
contract would enhance the capabilities of local companies in
hi-tech defense industry.
</P>
<P>
The patrol boats are said to use at least 30 percent local
components.
</P>
<P>
Abang Abu Bakar said the contract would help kick-start the
country's economic growth and speed up recovery.

<HEADLINE> Indian Government Presents Budget to Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government
presented the budget for 1999-2000 to the parliament Saturday with
an estimated 5.8-percent growth of gross domestic product (GDP) as
against 5 percent in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
The budget, the second for the central government led by
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) since March 1998, increases defense
expenditure to 456.94 billion rupees (about 10.88 billion U.S.
dollars), a hike of 44.94 billion rupees (1.07 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Growth of the agricultural and allied sectors is estimated at
5.3 percent while foreign currency reserves are up by 2 billion
dollars, according to the crucial budget tabled before the
parliament by Finance Minister Yaswant Sinha Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The budget proposed incentives for farmers' cooperatives to
lift fertilizer use during the April to May lean period and the
central government would provide special funds to states for land
consolidation.
</P>
<P>
Sinha told the parliament that fiscal deficit for 1998-1999 is
likely to increase to 6.5 percent of the GDP from the budget
target of 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to reduce the deficit to 4 percent of the GDP at
799.95 billion rupees (about 19.046 billion dollars) in 1999-2000
from 1.037 trillion rupees (about 24.7 billion dollars) in the
current financial year by stepping up efforts to increase revenue
while curbing expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Total expenditure for 1999-2000 was estimated at 2.839 trillion
rupees (67.6 billion dollars) as against 2.819 trillion rupees
(67.12 billion dollars) this financial year.
</P>
<P>
According to revised estimates for this year, non-plan
expenditure had increased by 176.16 billion rupees (about 4.19
billion dollars) and there was a shortfall of 36.31 billion rupees
(some 864.5 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The revenue deficit for next year was put at 2.7 percent of the
GDP, or 541.47 billion rupees (12.89 billion dollars) against
604.74 billion rupees (14.4 billion dollars) in 1998-99.

<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>

in the budget row could threaten the credibility of the single

way the community is financed.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>

to perform both tasks simultaneously without risking an accident,
according to the guide.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The largest legal action ever brought against the UK tobacco
industry collapsed Friday, reducing the prospect of litigation of
the kind mounted successfully in the U.S. succeeding in this
country.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- Race relations reforms are being ignored by police forces
throughout Britain and ethnic minority officers are continuing to

TIRANA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Albanian troops held a massive
war game near the border with Kosovo on Friday, flexing their
muscle amid worries for a possible spread of violence from the
troubled Yugoslavian province.
</P>
<P>
As reported by the official Albanian Telegraph Agency on

the sovereignty of our country may be threatened," he said.

peace talks opened in Rambouillet, France, earlier this month.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Students Free Arnoun from Israeli Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Lebanese
university students Friday night liberated a village annexed by
Israeli forces to its self-proclaimed "security zone" in south
Lebanon, the Daily Star reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The students, organized by the Union of Democratic Youth of
Lebanon, flocked to the village of Arnoun at noon and held a rally
beside the barricades set up by Israeli forces 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
They tore down some 200 meters of the fencing in the center of
the village which was erected as a demarcation line by the Israeli
forces.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers, stationed in the Beaufort Castle on the hill
overlooking Arnoun, fired several bursts in the air for warning.
</P>
<P>
Israel annexed Arnoun to its "security zone" in south Lebanon
on February 17, claiming that guerrillas of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, always used the village as a launching
pad for attacks on its outpost at the nearby Beaufort Castle.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the "security zone" in 1985 with a claimed aim of
protecting its north from cross-border attacks by Lebanese
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The students' campaign came when the Lebanese government's
diplomatic efforts to liberate the village appeared to be rapidly
losing momentum and the five-nation Monitoring Group became
helpless in the face of Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
The group comprising Lebanon, Israel, the United States,
France, Syria was established in 1996, commissioned with
monitoring truce between Lebanese guerrillas and Israeli forces
and precluding civilians from conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Richard Ehrdmann, chairman and U.S. delegate to the group,
delivered a message from Israel to the Lebanese government that
Israel would leave the village alone only after the student
demonstrations were halted.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon rejected the demand, saying it would not yield to any
Israeli conditions.
</P>
<P>
Western diplomatic sources confirmed that Israeli forces showed
no intention to replace the barbed-wire fence cordoning off Arnoun.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Emile Lahoud praised "the bold move of
Lebanese students and their courage in front of Israeli forces."
</P>
<P>
"This was an act of heroism in defending our national and
legitimate rights and to reflect our attachment to our land,"
Prime Minister Salim Hoss said.

<HEADLINE> NPC Legal Affairs Commission Spokesman on HK Court Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The statement made by Hong
Kong's highest court yesterday is necessary to clarify its
previous abode right judgment, said a spokesman of the Commission
of Legal Affairs of the National People's Congress (NPC) in an
interview with the press.
</P>
<P>
On January 29, the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) ruled that
mainland children born to Hong Kong permanent residents had the
right of abode in the territory, whether or not the parents were
married or they were residents at the time the children were born.
</P>
<P>
The ruling had produced strong repercussions in the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and aroused wide concern in
interior areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
As contents of the January 29 judgment involve the explanatory
right of the Basic Law of the HKSAR and the relationship between
the Central Chinese Government and HKSAR, people of the legal
communities from Hong Kong and the interior areas of the country
have made harsh comments on different occasions.
</P>
<P>
CFA yesterday conceded it cannot question the authority of the
NPC and its Standing Committee. Chief Justice Andrew Li said CFA
had agreed to a Hong Kong government request to clarify certain
parts of the controversial ruling giving the right of abode to
mainland children born to HK parents.
</P>
<P>
"The court accepts that it cannot query the authority of the NPC
and the Standing Committee which is in accordance with the Basic
Law and procedures therein," he said.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Legal Affairs Commission spokesman said: "We notice the
saying in CAF's decision yesterday that the judicial right of
courts in HKSAR is entrusted by the Basic Law which stipulates
under Article 158 the explanatory right of the law is up to the
NPC Standing Committee."
</P>
<P>
While calling the statement a necessary step to clarify the
January 29 judgment of CFA, the spokesman emphasized that the
National People's Congress is the highest state power organ of the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
"NPC and its Standing Committee will perform its duties
according to the principles of 'one country, two systems' and the
Basic Law of the HKSAR," the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Reforms Foreign Exchange Rate System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has reformed its
management system of the exchange rate between the Vietnamese dong
and foreign currencies, Vietnam News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Le Duc Thuy, deputy governor of Vietnam's state bank, announced
here on Friday the new decision made by the governor of the State
Bank of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Under the decision, Vietnam's state bank, basing itself on the
overnight exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Vietnamese
dong on Vietnam's interbank market, will announce only one daily
official average exchange rate instead of two exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
The decision restricts Vietnamese credit organizations to only
a plus or minus daily alteration of 0.1 percent on the Vietnamese
dong and U.S. dollar official exchange rate announced by the state
bank.
</P>
<P>
The credit organizations licensed to deal in foreign currencies
will base themselves on the interbank market's daily average
exchange rate to fix their selling and buying rates. The interbank
market's daily average exchange rate will also be used to
calculate import-export taxes and to fix the state bank's official
exchange rates between the Vietnamese dong and other foreign
currencies.
</P>
<P>
The managers of Vietnam's other credit organizations are
allowed to set their own daily exchange rates between the
Vietnamese dong and other foreign currencies, except for the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
The move is an attempt to make the Vietnamese dong a
convertible currency by letting it gradually fluctuate to meet
market demands and supplies.
</P>
<P>
Up until Friday, February 26, Vietnam had operated an official
exchange rate system, where Vietnam's state bank had set the
official exchange rate for the U.S. dollar for lengthy periods,
which all licensed commercial banks had to adhere to within a
7-percent trading band.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Claims Downing of Two Eritrean Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Su-27 warplanes
have allegedly shot down two Eritrean MiG-29 jets in dogfights
over Badme, approximately 900 km north of Addis Ababa, the
Monitor English newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted reliable sources as saying that the first
jet was brought down on Thursday and the second on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea has not confirmed the downing of its two jets, but said
it had destroyed 31 Ethiopian tanks, captured three and shot down
an attack helicopter Thursday, which Addis had also denied.
</P>
<P>
During the two days, the Monitor paper said, residents of
Mekele, capital of Ethiopia's Tigray State, "were reported to have
been treated to aerobatics performed by Ethiopian pilots returning
after downing Eritrean jets".
</P>
<P>
The air showdown reportedly took place amidst intense fighting
on the ground on the Badme front where Eritrea admitted Friday
that its defense line along the Badme front has been broken by
Ethiopian troops.
</P>
<P>
"The Ethiopians have emptied the other fronts to bring troops
to this front," and broke through at one place along the Badme
front Friday with "numerical superiority", an Eritrean spokesman
admitted.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Demands Monitoring on NGOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi has said non-governmental organizations (NGOs) should be
closely monitored and regulated, citing that Kenya's security
must be a top priority.
</P>
<P>
He ordered Thursday a proper network of government departments
be set up in Lokichogio in west Kenya's Rift Valley Province, in
a bid to monitor the operations of the over 40 NGOs which operate
under the umbrella of the Operation LIfeline Sudan, World Food
Program and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,
the official Kenya Times newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Noting that over 50 planes landed at Lokichogio daily, 25 of
which were foreign registered, Moi said Kenya's security should
be a top priority.
</P>
<P>
He called for an immediate end to the arrangement whereby
foreign soldiers worked in Lokichogio under the umbrella of the
World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that Kenya's soldiers and other security
agencies were capable of rendering such service.
</P>
<P>
He noted that while Kenya sympathized with the suffering of the
people from neighboring countries arising out of civil strife,
Kenya's security was not negotiable.
</P>
<P>
Because of civil strife, there were over 70,000 refugees in
Kakuma of Rife Valley Province, some of whom came from as far as
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Moi said if Western powers wished to see
peace in Africa, they should stop supplying arms and other
equipment of mass destruction to political factions in African
countries.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Review Agreement on Marcos Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Saturday ordered a review of the terms of a provisional
agreement giving 150 million U.S. dollars to 10,000 victims of
human rights abuses during the Marcos regime.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican, who accompanied Estrada
in Zamboanga City on his five-day visit to Mindanao, said Estrada
issued the order to ensure that the amount stated in the agreement
will reach their intended beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was forged recently among the family of the late
President Ferdinand Marcos, the government and the lawyers of the
human rights victims.
</P>
<P>
"The PCGG has been directed by the president to carefully
review the terms of the agreement and to make sure that the
proceeds will indeed go to the intended beneficiaries," Barican
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will not stand in the way of the
agreement between the Marcos family and the human rights victims.
</P>
<P>
"But of course, this agreement will still be subject to the
approval of the Sandiganbayan (supreme court)," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Estrada assured the human rights victims that the 150
million dollars will all go to them since the government and the
Marcos family have yet to forge a deal for the recovery of the
latter's alleged ill-gotten wealth.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also expressed confidence that this development would
eventually lead to smoother negotiations between the government
and the Marcoses for the recovery of the family's allegedly
ill-gotten fortune, which he intends to spend on his pro-poor
programs.

<HEADLINE> Changes At A Tibetan Aristocratic Manor House(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Palha Manor, one of the largest
aristocratic manor houses in Tibet, has seen real changes in the
past four decades.
</P>
<P>
"The manor was a hell for serfs and a paradise for slave owners
before the serf system was abolished in 1959," says Mima Toinzhub,
who was born in the manor as a serf and served there for 21 years.
</P>
<P>
There were four or five manor houses with the name Palha in
Tibet before 1959, all belonging to Palha Wangjig, which had more
than 3,000 serfs in their heyday. The largest manor is in Xigaze.
</P>
<P>
The aristocrats sought refuge abroad during the democratic
reform period of 40 years ago and their lands were distributed to
slaves. The manor house is now an exhibition hall that has played
host to 100,00 visitors.
</P>
<P>
In the miserable old days, Toinzhub says, Palha and his wife
lived in 80 spacious rooms, while their slaves, about 300 in
number, were crammed into a group of low, rundown slums, often
with 3 generations living in a 7-sq.m. room with only a stove and
one or two pottery jars.
</P>
<P>
There were instruments of torture like leather whips, laths,
and shackles hanging on the porch to punish serfs and the owner
built two cells and a cave that contained scorpions, where people
who dared cause trouble were thrown.
</P>
<P>
"I became a tailor at the manor at the age of 13 and used to
work from early morning until late at night, with only a spoonful
of low-quality Zamba," Toinzhub says. "I stayed hungry all day
long and never laughed in the 21 years I was a slave. My only wish
at that time was to eat my fill and have my freedom."

The population of the village doubled to 257 over the past 40
years. Last year, it produced 380,000 kg of grain. Per capita
income averaged 1,500 yuan last year, says Lhaba Logyai, the
village head. "My family has 1.8 hectares of farmland, 6 cows, a
horse, a mule, and 9 sheep. We have a two-storey building with
modern furniture, color TVs, and a sewing machine," the 54-year-
old man says. "Life today is really different."
</P>
<P>
Toinzhub is even better off than the village head, with a 10-
room building, 2.2 ha of farmland, 11 head of cattle, 2 horses,
and 10 sheep. "My family harvests 10,000 kg of grain each year and
the warehouse on the first floor holds enough surplus grain to
feed the 6 family members for five years," he says.
</P>
<P>
Toinzhub's 17-year-old grandson, Gesang, says that he will take
the college entrance exam after he graduates from high school. The

To show his thanks to the government, Toinzhub has put the
portrait of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping in his room. They are
decorated with Hada, a piece of white silk regarded as a token of
respect.
</P>

"Chairman Mao set us free from slavery and Deng Xiaoping led us
to carry out economic reforms that made us richer," he says.

Zambia Daily Mail newspaper Saturday quoted Akerele as saying

Akerele also commended the establishment of the international

Akerele noted that there are enough drugs for consumption but
that most of the substances had been abused in the guise of
prescription.

She indicated that cannabis may soon be turned to be a useful
drug for medication but that it would be treated cautiously like
other narcotic drugs.

"This means that cannabis used for medical purposes will be
subject to licensing and other control measures foreseen under the
international drug control treaties," she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- New regulations issued by the
Ministry of Labor and Social Security will involve some 140
million more people on China's unemployment insurance system, up
significantly on the 79.6 million people previously enjoying such
coverage.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment insurance coverage will be expanded from state-
owned enterprises to include non-state, foreign-funded and private
enterprises in line with the new regulation recently added to the
Underemployment Insurance Regulations, according to Guangming
Daily.
</P>
<P>
Employees of city and township enterprises will be required to
contribute one percent or two percent of total salaries to the
unemployment insurance fund which will be supplemented with
national subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that the revenue will provide a solid foundation
for the unemployment insurance fund.
</P>
<P>
Individuals who lose their jobs after paying unemployment
insurance fees for one year, as well as registered unemployed
workers seeking new occupations will be eligible for subsidies
from the fund, according to the regulations.
</P>
<P>
The term of eligibility will depend on how long individuals has
contributed to the unemployment insurance fund.

<HEADLINE> Scientists: Dinosaur-birds Are Not Father of Birds (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The small bird-like dinosaurs and the remote village where they
had remained unknown for 130 million years have become the leading
topics for worldwide paleontologists.
</P>
<P>
Many scientists are concerned about the reports in some
domestic newspapers that the dinosaur-birds, or sinosauropteryx,
actually fathered the modern species of birds.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to resolve this dispute Xinhua today arranged an
exclusive interview with Chinese leading bird expert Hou Lianhai,
research fellow with the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of
Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, and dinosaur expert
Dong Zhiming, a research fellow with the same institute.
</P>
<P>
"The fossilized archaeopteryx which was excavated in 1861 in
Germany was the earliest known bird on the earth," they said.
</P>
<P>
"While the finding of sinosauropteryx pushed forward the
research on the bird's origin, the small theropod dinosaur could
not substitute the archaeopteryx as the father of all birds," they
added.
</P>
<P>
"After repeated studies of the fossils, I don't believe the
creature had the same key characteristics as birds," Hou said, "
Birds might be remote cousins of dinosaur-birds rather than their
lineal descendants."
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, famous dinosaur researcher John Ostrom at Yale
University concluded that the archaeopteryx resembled a scaled-
down version of the theropod dinosaur known as deinonychus.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Leader Acknowledges Expanding Relations With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Cuban leader Fidel Castro said
Friday that his country's relations with China are improving as
bilateral cooperation deepens in many areas.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban government, Fidel Castro said here at the Palace of
Revolution in meeting with Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian,
gives a high priority to expanding its ties with China.
</P>
<P>
As Chi, here since Thursday on a three-day visit, passed his
greetings to the host from Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Castro
asked the guest to deliver his greetings to the Chinese leader.
</P>
<P>
Besides topics regarding Cuba-China relations, the two also
exchanged views on various international issues.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Cuban Minister of the Revolutionary Armed
Forces Raul Castro met Chi and expressed his country's willingness
to further step up friendly relations and cooperation with China
in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Raul Castro, concurrently first vice president of the Council
of Ministers, said Chi's visit to Cuba -- the first by a Chinese
defense minister -- marked the start of a new stage in the
bilateral military ties.
</P>
<P>
He applauded China's development, saying the country is playing
an increasingly important role in the world.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Chi said China and Cuba have shared common
interests and views on many issues, noting that the two countries
have been expanding cooperation in military and many other fields
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He briefed his Cuban counterpart on China's defense policies,
foreign policies and latest developments.
</P>
<P>
Chi also reviewed the honor guards of the Cuban armed forces at
a welcome ceremony and then visited a couple of military units.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Sets Conditions for Peace Talks With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Saturday that any further talks with rebel groups
will only focus on development and efforts to improve the life of
the people in Mindanao and other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview in Zamboanga City, Mindanao, Estrada said
it is time to put a stop to conditions imposed by rebels on
continuing peace talks initiated by the government.
</P>
<P>
"They are the ones giving the conditions on where the president
will meet with them," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada has canceled a meeting scheduled for Sunday
with Hashim Salamat, chairman of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF). He has agreed to meet Salamat on board a presidential
yacht, but Salamat has insisted on meeting somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
The MILF chairman also insisted that 300 government soldiers
and 300 MILF rebels secure the meeting instead of only four
escorts.
</P>
<P>
"Why should the MILF be there in big numbers, that would not be
a problem if the meeting is personal, but as president, that will
not look good," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the agenda of any meeting should only be on the
"development of Mindanao."
</P>
<P>
He said talks about secession or the establishment of an
independent Islamic state as demanded by the MILF is out of the
question.
</P>
<P>
But Estrada noted that the doors to peace talks will remain
open for as long as the talks will focus on peace and development.

<HEADLINE> Scientists: Dinosaur-birds Are Not Father of Birds (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The discoveries in Liaoning of the once-feathered creatures, or
protarchaeopteryx, apparently lent some credence to the hypothesis
that birds descended from small theropod dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
However, Hou rejected the theory of a direct connection between
dinosaur-birds and modern birds.
</P>
<P>
"The two short-armed specimens have saw-like teeth that were
flat and sharp, with deep bulbous roots, unlike the modern bird's
conical shape," Hou said.
</P>
<P>
Also, their short arms could not support their bodies, and they
basically depended on two legs when moving, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The feathered creature that lived in the place of Liaoning
might not share a close evolutionary heritage with birds," Dong
said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, many vertebrate paleontologists have begun to
question whether feathers are key features that automatically mean
a feathered creature is a bird.
</P>
<P>
Seven researchers from the institute, including Hou, attended a
congratulatory symposium, coinciding with the retirement of Ostrom,
on February 12 at Yale University.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide authoritative scientists praised the achievements of
Chinese scholars in the field. They also made note of the location
of the treasured fossils in Liaoning.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Backgrounder on the Tibetan
ethnic group:
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan Ethnic Group, involving 4.59 million people, is
distributed in the Tibet Autonomous Region, Qinghai and Gansu
provinces in northwest China, and Sichuan and Yunnan provinces in
the southwest.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetans originally lived along the banks of the Yarlung
Zangbo River. In the early seventh century, Songzen Gampo
established the state known as "Tubo," which used slave labor.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan language has three main dialects and the Tibetan
written language also dates from the seventh century.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has produced a great many books on Buddhism and Tibetan
medicine, including "King Gesar," the longest epic in the world,
which was originally an oral account of how the hero rid the
people of evils. This epic provides a vivid picture of life in
ancient Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The religion of Lamaism has exerted a profound influence on
Tibetan culture and customs.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan men and women both wear wool or fur hats and silk or
cotton blouses and robes, and rural women often wear aprons
designed with beautiful patterns.
</P>
<P>
The "Hada" is the most common gift among Tibetans, especially
on holidays and other important occasions. This is a 2-to-3-foot-
long silk scarf, a greater length signifying great respect for the
recipient. People present "Hadas" of various lengths depending on
the social status of the recipient.
</P>
<P>
The staple food of the Tibetan people is roasted highland
barley flour, and the main beverages are butter tea, milk tea and
barley wine. Most Tibetans eat neither fish nor fowl.

<HEADLINE> OSCE Monitor Says Belgrade Will Admit NATO Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 26 (Xinhua) -- William Walker, top observer
in Kosovo for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE), said on Friday that Yugoslavia will be forced to
allow NATO troops to enter the embattled province of Serbia within
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a Yugoslavian newspaper, Walker, chairman
of the OSCE Verification Mission to Kosovo, said ethnic Albanians
would not be able to gain independence in the near future because
they could not defeat the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
He also said the Serbs could only weaken the Kosovo Liberation
Army (KLA) but could not eliminate them.
</P>
<P>
Walker said most Kosovo Albanians would welcome the arrival of
the NATO troops, which is part of the peace plan proposed by the
international Contact Group for the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
But Walker predicted that Albanian guerrillas would turn over a
small proportion of their weapons to NATO peacekeepers.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Govt to Eliminate Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government has
committed to eliminating child labor by strict enforcing of its
strong legislation, the official Daily News reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a ceremony held recently to inaugurate a tripartite
workshop on the International labor convention of the
International Labor Organization (ILO), Labor Minister W.D.J.
Seneviratne said child labor is a major problem for Sri Lanka and
other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The minister said a multi-disciplinary approach and collective
efforts of all government, non-government agencies, community and
religious organizations and the public are also needed to achieve
the goal of enforcing a minimum age of employment.
</P>
<P>
According to the Sri Lankan law, no child under 14 could be
employed in industry or commerce and no child under 12 could be
employed in domestic service.
</P>
<P>
The necessity of a minimum age of employment is of prime
importance specially in the context of child labor, which is the
result of socio economic conditions prevailing in the country, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan labor force survey of 1995 has revealed that
20,600 children between 10 to 14 years are employed, and of them
6,900 are females.
</P>
<P>
Quoting ILO statistics, the minister said there are 73 million
child workers in the world and no region or country is entirely
free from child labor. Sri Lanka, too, is not an exception.
</P>
<P>
The minister said child labor in Sri Lanka is mostly prevalent
in the domestic sphere since children of poor families are
released for domestic employment by parents who cannot afford to
bring them up.
</P>
<P>
He added that it was important to strengthen the labor
inspection services by a specially trained inspectors.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Get 900m U.S. Dollars Flood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has received good
responses to its appeal for international assistance to the tune
of 900 million U.S. dollars after the flood last year, press
reports here said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The aid pledged, in such forms as emergency flood relief,
post-flood rehabilitation assistance, import and reserve supports,
is fairly around the requisition placed, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government received 191 million dollars as
emergency flood relief by 30 November 1998, including food and
other relief materials, an Economic Relations Division official
said.
</P>
<P>
And after November 30 last year, long-term rehabilitation
assistance began to arrive, he added.
</P>
<P>
The country has received 138 million dollars from the
International Monetary Fund as reserve support which directly went
to the Bangladesh Bank, the central bank, and another 138 million
dollars from the Asian Development Bank for long-term post-flood
infrastructural rehabilitation, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has also given 200 million dollars as import
support to help the government foot the post-flood emergency
import bills, and another 165 million dollars as flood aid.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 941.24 million dollars are needed for Bangladesh's
flood rehabilitation, according to Finance Minister A.M.S. Kibria.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh was badly hit by a prolonged flood last year, which
lasted from July to September, affecting two-thirds of the country
and inflicting an estimated loss of 4.3 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> EDS-News Analysis South Korean Economy Shows Recovery But Still Long Way To Go </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The battered South Korean
economy is recovering rapidly as nearly all key indicators
bottomed out in December and demonstrated a sharp upward trend in
January, but both government and economic experts predict a long
way to go to full recovery.
</P>
<P>
Power generation and industrial power consumption, barometers
of the country's industrial production, rose 8.6 percent and 12.8
percent respectively in January, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Production of semi-conductors, one of the country's major
export items, soared 105.1 percent in the month after an increase
of 249.1 percent in December 1998. Automobile production grew 37
percent in January, following a moderate 2.4 percent increase in
December, while auto exports jumped 12.3 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
Petrochemical production saw a 12.3 percent growth in January
on top of a 2.8 percent increase in December.
</P>
<P>
Domestic consumption expanded along with growing industrial
activities. Semi-conductor shipments for internal use surged 417.8
percent in January, exceeding the 112.6 percent rise last December,
while auto shipments for domestic markets rocketed 101.5 percent
from the 6.6 percent growth last December.
</P>
<P>
In addition, key indicators monitoring department store sales,
highway traffic volume and gasoline consumption showed a sharp
increase in January over the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Department store sales went up 11.2 percent in January,
following a 13.2 percent rise last December, while gasoline
consumption grew 10.2 percent, the first increase since the
financial crisis caused by corporate failures and financial
institutions' bad loans which swept the country in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
This upward consumption trend is based on a rise in the import
of consumer goods, up 66.3 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
Based on the encouraging figures, President Kim Dae-jung
predicted that the economy will grow by 2 percent this year,
compared with an estimated 6 percent contraction in 1998. But he
cautioned the Korean people against complacency.
</P>
<P>
Looking calm at a televised meeting with his people, Kim said:
"This is no time to pop open champagne. The government has no
champagne ready. We are just coming out of a dark tunnel and
advancing toward blinking lights of hope ahead," Kim said. He
stressed the need to accelerate the pace of restructuring
inefficient conglomerates, or chaebols.
</P>
<P>
His point of view was shared by the nation's economic analysts,
who cautioned against the possibility of overestimation because
the number of working days in January surpassed those of the
previous year as the lunar new year fell in January last year and
in February this year.
</P>
<P>
They said there are still too many pitfalls ahead, which could
spoil the fledgling recovery, such as heavy bad debt burdens and
rising unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The employment situation remained bleak in January; the jobless
figure hit a record high of 1.76 million in January.
</P>
<P>
A weak Japanese yen, among other external factors, could also
hinder the recovery, said the analysts.

<HEADLINE> Smoke Causes Health, Flight Problems in Thai Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Bushfire smoke has shrouded
the northern province of Mae Hong Son in Thailand, causing
respiratory ailments and flight cancellations, the Bangkok Post
newspaper said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a provincial public health official as
saying that people have been warned against out-doors morning and
evening  exercising when smoke is at its thickest.
</P>
<P>
Dust density has climbed and the public health office is
closely monitoring the smoke situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that so far over 100 people have been treated
at various hospitals for rash, allergy and respiratory complaints.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the smoke was a result of slash-and-burn
farm clearing tactics. A stern warning against the tactics has
been issued and violators would be arrested.
</P>
<P>
It was predicted the smoke would linger into March as the
problem was likely to intensify.
</P>
<P>
A provincial manager for Thai Airways International said the
airline has had to divert or cancel some of its flights to the
province.
</P>
<P>
Since January, at least 20 flights were diverted due to poor
visibility, and conditions permissible for landing occurred only
during late afternoon, according to the manager.

March 1, Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy and his German counterpart will take part in a
bilateral Canada-Germany meeting and in a Canada-EU meeting, with
the latter involving the participation of Sir Leon Brittan,
according to the Canadian foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
"Canada's relations with Germany are based on a commonality of
values and priorities," said Axworthy, "This compatibility
translates not only in our ability to develop, adopt and implement
joint and parallel policies, for example, with respect to
landmines, but also in our ability to cooperate within
multilateral forums such as NATO, the U.N. and the G-8."
</P>
<P>
The bilateral meeting between Axworthy and Fischer will focus
on a range of bilateral and multilateral issues including the
upcoming G-8 meeting in Koln, Germany; the upcoming NATO summit,
Canadian priorities at the U.N. Security Council, international
peacekeeping, the Middle East Peace Process and economic reforms
in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
In the context of the Canada-EU transatlantic ministerial
meeting, Axworthy, Fischer and Sir Leon Brittan will focus on
cooperation on human security issues such as small arms and
landmines, and conflict situations in Kosovo and Africa. The
status of Canada-EU relations and objectives for the next Canada-
EU Summit will also be raised.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Los Angeles Lakers will
finally have Dennis Rodman in the lineup tonight and may also
decide on the coach responsible for putting up with his antics.
</P>
<P>
After signing Rodman on Tuesday night, the Lakers fired coach
Del Harris the following day on the heels of a three-game losing
streak.
</P>
<P>
General manager Jerry West said the new coach would be either
Larry Drew or Kurt Rambis, who were assistants under Harris.
</P>
<P>
Rodman showed up in purple hair and participated in the
shootaround today. He is expected to play tonight when the Lakers
and Clippers conclude a home-and-home series.
</P>
<P>
"From a playing perspective, I don't think there's any doubt he
will help our basketball team," West said of Rodman. "Sometimes we
need a little fire. He will add some spice to the Lakers."
</P>
<P>
Rodman, who has not played since the decisive Game Six of last
season's NBA Finals on June 14, will wear uniform No. 73. The
seven commemorates his consecutive rebounding titles and the three
is for the trio of consecutive championships he won with the Bulls.

<HEADLINE> Debates Heat up over Rail Line along Yangtze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Constructing a rational and
comprehensive passageway along the Yangtze River has raised heated
debates in China.
</P>
<P>
Experts for the project said the construction of a railway
running alongside the longest river in the nation could speed up
the economic development in the area, while those against the rail
line noted that it would make the transportation system too
crowded.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the lack of a comprehensive railway system, the
exchange of commodities and passengers of the Yangtze River basin
has been severely restricted, argued Wang Hai, a researcher with
the Jiangsu Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
For a densely populated and economic hub like the Yangtze River
basin, a single means of water transportation can not meet the
demands of modern life, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
With a comprehensive transportation system, the Yangtze River
basin will be able to play its role as a pivotal passageway to
South, Central and West China better, maintained the researcher.
</P>
<P>
As the state has already chosen Shanghai's Pudong New Area, the
Three Gorges Project and Chongqing as three growth zones of the
nation, the move will also lay a solid foundation for sustained
economic growth for the Yangtze River basin and contribute to
China's overall development in the next century.
</P>
<P>
People who are strongly against the railway cited the surging
road construction in the river basin, saying that plans have been
made to build main highways to link up major cities along the
Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Construction of another railway in the basin would bring
serious challenges to the already gloomy water transport sector
there and make the present transportation system more crowded,
they said.
</P>
<P>
China pins high hopes on the Yangtze River to play a bigger
role as China's main waterway in its development strategies for
the river basin.
</P>
<P>
The transportation capacity of the Yangtze is equal to that of
a highway with 14 lanes, and upon the completion of the Three
Gorges Project, ships with over 10,000 tons will be able to sail
up to Chongqing on the upper reaches of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the highway network along the river could
provide people with convenient short distance transport, while
passengers who travel long distances alongside the river will
likely prefer airplane to railway.
</P>
<P>
Money saved from railway construction could be used to fund
other road construction in backward places, they suggested.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, it seems that a rationally constructed
passageway along the Yangtze will remain an arduous task for the
government and a hot topic for experts.

<HEADLINE> Terrorist Attack Disrupts Colombian Oil Pipeline Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's ability
to transport oil through the main Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline was
suspended Friday after a section of the pipe was dynamited by
rebels, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
It was the 15th terrorist attack this year against the
pipeline, which carries crude oil from the Colombian eastern
fields to the Covenas Caribbean port..
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman in Santa fe de Bogota said the pipeline
was dynamited in a remote zone of Norte de Santander, a department
near the northeast border with Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Authorities of Cucuta, the capital of Norte de Santander, said
the attack was attributed to the National Liberation Army (ELN).
</P>
<P>
The rebel group, the second largest in the country after the
Revolutionary Forces of Colombia (FARC), has maintained attacks
against oil infrastructure related to multinational installations
since 1986, which it then declared military targets.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1.7 million barrels of crude have been spilled in more
than 700 attacks over the past 13 years. the attacks have caused
great harm to the environment, according to authorities.
</P>
<P>
A team of technicians from the state-owned Oil Colombian
Enterprise (Ecopetrol) has assessed the damage and is expected to
initiate repairs soon.

BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Marine safety and the
prevention of offshore pollution resulting from shipping activity
are getting a new emphasis in China, today's "China Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
The newly established China Maritime Safety Administration will
take action to improve marine safety and curb pollution caused by
ships, the newspaper quoted Deputy Director-General Liu gongchen
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the first national work conference yesterday held

a highly efficient maritime management system will be introduced
in the country's marine areas, at ports and along inland rivers to
ensure "safer shipping and cleaner waters".
</P>

The official also called for increased inspection cruises in
expanded offshore areas in 1999 to timely detect and deal with
marine accidents and illegal effluent-discharges, and to guarantee
safe waterways.

Last year, the administration set up an inspection fleet of 150
vessels, which traveled 45,990 total nautical miles to supervise
maritime law enforcement and to handle emergency accidents. It
also conducted more than 530 marine search and rescue operations,
helping 3,856 people escape danger in the past year.
</P>
<P>
The administration will cooperate with the People's Liberation
Army (PLA) and foreign countries to achieve better results in
marine search and rescue operations this year, said the official.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the inspection ratio of foreign ships will be
increased in 1999, while management of medium- ad small-sized
shipping companies will be enhanced this year.
</P>
<P>
His administration will also check the sea-worthiness of
vessels, imported old ships and those owned by townships, and step
up creation of a quick-response mechanism to curb oil-spill
pollution in marine waters and deal with related accidents in time.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Uses New System to Detect Volcanic Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is using a system of
applied satellite technology to detect isolated volcanic activity
by remote sensing, the Indonesian Observer reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Argos system is like an early warning device,
said Sukhyar, director of the Volcanology Agency in Bandung,
capital of West Java province.
</P>
<P>
"The system receives increasing indications of volcanic
activities and 'warnings' can be anticipated by the Volcanology
Agency. Even explosions can be predicted. The equipment receives
data every two minutes," Sukhyar said.
</P>
<P>
The Argos system has been used at the agency's laboratory since
last May and has indicated several volcanoes as potentially
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
They include Mount Karangetang and Mount Lokon in South
Sulawesi, Mount Gunung Ibu in East Java, and Anak Krakatau, which
is located in the Java Straits and has recently been billowing
smoke.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- China will mount a four-year
campaign to guarantee sustainable development by establishing a
legal system to protect the environment and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
"Strengthening legal protection for the environment and natural
resources will be at the top of the agenda for the Environment and
Resources Protection Committee (ERPC) under the National People's
Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, according to ERPC chairman Qu
Geping.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Qu said the
committee will accelerate the rectification effort and draft basic
laws covering protection of the environment and natural resources.
Efforts will also center on improving special laws covering
pollution prevention, resource protection and ecological
construction.
</P>
<P>
"All related laws should serve the fundamental interests of the
people and the overall situation of the nation," said Qu.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the major tasks for this year will center
on the draft Marine Environment Protection Law and draft Air
Pollution Prevention Law and strengthening laws on environmental
impact appraisals, desertification and pollution-free production.
</P>
<P>
Legislation involving environmental and resource protection
will follow the basic principles of the sustainable development
strategy, using science and technology to revitalize the nation
and ensuring that development of the economy, population,
resources and environment meet the needs of the market economy.
</P>
<P>
The ERPC will examine successful experiences both at home and
abroad in order to solve the essential legislative issues,
according to Qu.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian House Approves Revised State Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's House of
Representatives has approved the 1999/2000 State Budget with some
changes in revenue and expenditure targets, the Jakarta Post
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Following revisions, the budget for the 1999/2000 fiscal year,
which begins in April, is a balanced 219.6 trillion rupiah (25.8
billion U.S. dollars), higher than the 218.2 trillion rupiah (25.6
billion dollars) initially proposed by the government.
</P>
<P>
"The 1999/2000 State Budget has been carefully and
realistically designed based on assumptions and evaluations of
various internal and external developments, both current and
future," Finance Minister Bambang Subianto told the parliament
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The budget assumes zero economic growth, from an economic
contraction of more than minus 13 percent last year. Inflation is
assumed at 17 percent, down from 66 percent in the previous year,
while the exchange rate for the rupiah against the U.S. dollar is
forecast at 7,500 rupiah, up from 10,600 rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The revisions in the 1999/2000 State Budget include a
15-percent to 50-percent salary increase for civil servants.
</P>
<P>
Spending for the bank recapitalization program has been lowered
to 17 trillion rupiah (2 billion U.S. dollars) from the initially
proposed 18 trillion rupiah (2.1 billion dollars).

The NPC Standing Committee has adopted six laws covering
environmental protection and the marine environment, as well as
the prevention of water, air, solid waste and noise pollution.
</P>
<P>
The committee has issued nine resource management laws related
to forestry, grasslands, fishing, mineral resources, land
management, water resources, wild animal protection, water and
soil conservation, and coal resources.
</P>
<P>
Legislative work related to environmental and resource
protection has been strengthened, and the NPC Standing Committee
recently approved the revised Forestry Law and Land Management Law.
</P>
<P>
"A major stumbling block in the country's legislative efforts
to improve environmental and resource protection centers on the
fact that the actual authority of the law has not yet been
strengthened," said Qu, adding that some laws have not been
implemented properly and still others have been violated.
</P>
<P>
He said the ERPC will continue efforts for legal inspection of
environmental and resource protection, and strive to provide solid
guarantees to ensure the effective implementation of laws and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
This year's ERPC enforcement efforts will focus on
implementation of the Air Pollution Prevention Law.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Exports Outperform Imports in Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The quality of China's exports
improved last year, but the quality of imported goods declined,
reported the State Administration for Entry-Exit Inspection and
Quarantine.
</P>
<P>
The administration came up with the conclusion after inspecting
2.52 billion batches of commodities valued at 105.8 billion US
dollars that were bound for export and 427,000 batches of imported
goods worth 43.1 billion US dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The export of 10,500 batches of commodities valued at 335
million US dollars was blocked because the items did not meet
state standards.
</P>
<P>
This represented 0.11 percent fewer blocked export shipments
and 0.13 percent less blockages in monetary terms during 1998 than
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Aquatic products, power generating machines and fabric-based
clothing achieved a higher qualification rate than other export
products last year, while coal, tea, pig iron, cotton, electronic
calculators, and bicycles were found to have more quality problems,
the administration said.
</P>
<P>
The quality of exported grain improved, along with ferrosilicon,
recorders and watches.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, about 4.45 percent of imported products inspected -
- about 3.9 percent of the total value -- were found to have
quality problems.
</P>
<P>
The rates were 0.46 percentage points and 0.61 percentage
points higher than 1997 levels, according to the administration.
</P>
<P>
As much as 36.85 percent of cotton imported into China fell
short of quality standards last year, the highest failure rate of
all imported products.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Warring Parties Urged to Make Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Romania and Switzerland on
Friday jointly urged warring parties in the embattled Yugoslav
province of Kosovo to find a quick and lasting solution to the
Kosovo conflict during the next round of peace talks in March.
</P>
<P>
The calls were issued by Romanian Foreign Minister Andrei
Gabriel Plesu and his visiting Swiss counterpart, Flavio Cotti,
following a meeting.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference, Cotti said the two countries
shared "common views" on resolving the long-standing conflict in
Kosovo, a mainly ethnic Albanian-populated province in southern
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government and ethnic Albanians will resume peace
talks in Rambouillet, in the suburbs of Paris, on March 15. The
talks were proposed by the international Contact Group on the ex-
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
During the first round of peace talks this month, the two sides
failed to agree on a peace plan.
</P>
<P>
Besides Kosovo, Plesu said they also discussed bilateral
relations and cooperation in dealing with international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Cotti said he has promised Plesu to "unconditionally" support
Romania in its bid for the presidency of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
Cotti, who arrived here Friday for a one-day visit, said that
Romania's election as the OSCE presidency state is significant
because of the country's location in the Balkans, home to several
hot spots in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Destroys Last SS-19 Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine on Friday destroyed the
last of its 111 SS-19 missiles under a U.S.-financed disarmament
program.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was held at a Soviet-era factory in the
southeastern city of Dnepropetrovsk, which helped bring this class
of missiles to the world. U.S. and Ukrainian officials presided
over the missiles' destruction, the Ukrainian Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine inherited 130 SS-19 missiles, 46 SS-24 missiles and 44
strategic bombers from the Soviet Union. It later sold 19 SS-19
missiles to Russia, according to Ukrainian officials.
</P>
<P>
After Ukraine signed the START I disarmament treaty in 1994,
the U.S. financed the former Soviet republic, under a Cooperative
Threat Reduction program, to complete the process of destroying
the missiles and silos, which once held nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
The process of pulling Ukraine's SS-24 missiles from their
silos and destroying the silos has already begun.
</P>
<P>
Officials on both sides however say extracting the solid fuel
used in SS-24s is a more challenging process than draining the SS-
19s' liquid fuel. A decision has yet to be made about how and
when to start the work.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Supporters of Manchester United
Friday voiced concern about the club's place in future European
competitions if a merger between BSkyB and French broadcasting
company, Canal Plus, goes ahead.
</P>
<P>
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission is currently looking into
BSkyB's 623.4 million pounds takeover bid for United and is due to
deliver its report by March 12.
</P>
<P>
But Shareholders United against Murdoch (SUAM) claimed news of
BSkyB's rumored talks with Canal Plus lent weight to their
arguments against the takeover deal.
</P>
<P>
Canal Plus already holds a controlling stake in French club
Paris St Germain and UEFA regulations state that no owner is
allowed to enter more than one side in any European competition.
</P>
<P>
"One can easily see a terrible situation where it's a choice
between Manchester United and Paris St Germain - and one shouldn't
assume that just because Manchester United are the bigger club
that Paris St Germain will be forced to give up their place.
</P>
<P>
"What would French supporters think of that? And what if Paris
St Germain are the French champions and Manchester United only
qualify for the Champions' League as runners-up or by coming third
in the Premiership?" said SUAM spokesman Michael Crick.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a nightmare to sort out, especially when competing
in Europe means so much to Manchester United," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission said any possible merger
between BSkyB and Canal Plus does not come under its remit.
</P>
<P>
"But all views are considered by us, and if SUAM have written
to us then their views will be taken into account," a spokesman
added.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Asked to Float More Global Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- International investors have
asked the Philippine government to float another 500 million U.S.
dollars worth of global bonds following its successful offering of
1 billion dollars of global bonds earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Star newspaper reported Saturday that the new
offer is being studied carefully in lieu of a planned
300-million-dollar Eurobond offering.
</P>
<P>
The team of Philippine officials successfully completed Friday
a one-week roadshow for the Eurobond offering in several European
cities, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper cited finance department sources as saying that the
Philippine officials' presentation was well-received, enabling
European investors to recognize and appreciate fully the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources said, there has been no decision yet on
whether to proceed or not with the Eurobond issuance due to a
number of factors.
</P>
<P>
For one, the sources said, the Philippine panel is still
looking at the spreads on the Eurobonds and that of the global
bonds.
</P>
<P>
The euro, when it was launched on January 1 this year, was
pegged at 1.16 euro to the dollar. But in the past weeks, the euro
was down to 1.09 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the government may adopt a wait-and-see
attitude first before deciding if it will float the Eurobonds.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government issued 1 billion dollars worth of
global bonds in January and an additional 200 million dollars were
again offered this month following more bids from international
investors.

Kemp said jail officials at the Montgomery County, Md, made the
reversal of the disciplinary action after hearing an appeal from
Tyson.
</P>
<P>
"They are allowing his doctor to prescribe his medication,"
Kemp said, adding that Dr. Richard Goldberg and Tyson's private
physician saw him Thursday at the jail.
</P>
<P>
Kemp had said the TV incident was provoked when the former
heavyweight champion was abruptly taken off Zoloft, an
antidepressant drug he had been taking for four months.
</P>
<P>
Tyson was sentenced a one-year jail term on February 5 and he
can appeal the sentence before March 7. But Kemp said he made no
decision concerning that appeal.

<HEADLINE> Bolivia, Colombia Pleased With U.S. Anti-drug Certification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Bolivian government
expressed satisfaction Friday with certification of the country's
anti-drug effort by the United States, said the president's
spokesman Mauro Bertero.
</P>
<P>
Reports received from Bolivia quoted Bertero as saying
certification supports the Dignity Plan, implemented by the
government of President Hugo Banzer, to eradicate illegal coca
cultivation in the El Chapare tropical zone and end the production
of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
Bertero said 8,000 hectares of coca were eradicated and the
production of cocaine was reduced by 25 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian government also expressed satisfaction with the U.
S. decision to certify its cooperation in the drug war.
</P>
<P>
After the Washington announcement, Foreign Minister Guillermo
Fernandez deSoto said, "It is a great cause of satisfaction for
Colombia, especiallyk after going through a very difficult stage
in relations with the United States," in a clear reference to the
previous government of Ernesto Samper. The certification, he
concluded, recognizes that the nation's anti-drug efforts are
improving.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that a new stage in the normalization
of relations, together with the strengthening of cooperation with
the U.S., starts now.

<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Ningbo Port, China's second
largest seaport located in Zhejiang Province, has reported a
record freight volume for the first 45 days of the new year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show the port handled close to 12 million tons of
cargo during the period, up 18 percent on the same 1998 period.
The container handling volume surged 60 percent to over 62,000
TEUs, including shipments carried by five foreign ships.
</P>
<P>
Lu Bohong, vice-director of the Ningbo Port Administrative
Office, attributed the growth to improved services.
</P>
<P>
The port helped to substantially reduce transportation costs by
offering coordinated sea-river transport to small and medium-sized
steel plants along the Yangtze River, in addition to strengthening
internal management to reduce the time required for loading and
off-loading.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the port expects to handle 90 million tons of cargo and
500,000 TEU containers this year.

<HEADLINE> Marcos Family Agrees to Compromise Talks With Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The family of the late
President Ferdinand Marcos has agreed to have more compromise
talks with the government over the sharing of the Marcos wealth,
the Manila Standard said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that after finalizing the compromise deal
awarding 150 million U.S. dollars of the Marcos wealth to some
10,000 "human rights victims," Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the only son
of the late President Marcos, agreed with the government that more
compromise talks should follow.
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times reported Thursday that victims of human
rights violations by the late President Marcos reached a tentative
150-million-dollar settlement in a U.S. court that appears to end
a 13-year legal battle.
</P>
<P>
"Now that this has been accepted, we can start talking with the
government," said the Marcos' son.
</P>
<P>
But Justice Secretary Serafin Cuevas said that the settlement
was not yet, is not yet binding because a Philippine court has yet
to take jurisdiction over the agreement.
</P>
<P>
This means the 570-million-dollar escrow fund deposited at in
the Philippine National Bank could not be used to indemnify the
human rights victims as the court has yet to establish its
ownership.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora as saying
that the next step will be to strike an out-of-court settlement
for a sharing of what remains of the 570-million-dollar Swiss bank
deposits between the Marcos heirs and the government.
</P>
<P>
The Estrada administration will pursue a 75-25 percent division
of the remainder of the Marcos money.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Senate Approves Fraga as Central Bank Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian Senate Friday
approved Economist Arminio Fraga Neto as the president of Brazil's
Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
Fraga said in a speech during a Senate discussion that the two
major changes Brazil is undergoing -- the budget adjustment and
the reform of the flexible exchange system -- will eventually take
the country to a promising future.
</P>
<P>
The new central bank chief said interest rates may drop in the
near future because of the improvement in the public deficit
situation and the end of pressure on the exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
Fraga said the central bank is committed to reduce inflation
through a strong budget policy. He also defended the autonomy and
the transparency of the central bank as a fundamental condition
for the credibility of the institution.
</P>
<P>
The two largest stock markets in the country reacted favorably
to Fraga's approval by the Senate. Bovespa of Sao Paulo
registered a 2.2 percent gain during the afternoon session, while
the Rio de Janeiro Stock Market registered a 2.4 percent gain.

<HEADLINE> Mauresmo Ousts Hingis at Paris Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- France's Amelie Mauresmo rallied
from one set down to oust world number one Martina Hingis of
Switzerland from the Paris Open women's tennis tourney on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mauresmo, a 2-6, 6-1, 6-3 winner, established a semifinals
clash against Belgium's Dominique Van Roost and avenged her loss
to Hingis in last month's Australian Open final in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
Friday's match was much hyped because of not only that previous
encounter, but also the "half a man" label Hingis reportedly gave
Mauresmo before their Australian clash.
</P>
<P>
"Today I beat the world number one and this is something very
special to me", the 19-year-old Mauresmo said Friday. "In
Australia, I had beaten Lindsay Davenport who was in the top spot
then. Today I beat the other one, and this is superb.
</P>
<P>
After losing the first set, Mauresmo broke Hingis's serve in
the first game of the second set and kept the momentum going to
take the set.
</P>
<P>
Hingis was apparently out of tempo in the deciding set and
could not avoid another break on her serve to give Mauresmo a 5-3
lead.
</P>
<P>
In another quarterfinal, Van Roost ousted Russian Elena
Likhovtseva 7-5, 6-0.

<HEADLINE> Kafelnikov Fails to Take Top Spot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia
failed to take the world tennis top spot when he lost to Thomas
Johansson 6-2, 7-6 in the London Indoor tennis tournament on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Victory over the Swede would have allowed Kafelnikov to replace
Pete Sampras at the top of the rankings. But the Russian looked
ill at ease from the opening game when he lost his serve with two
double faults.
</P>
<P>
Johansson, playing tight, controlled tennis, broke serve again
to take the set as top seed Kafelnikov prowled the baseline
berating himself for a string of mistakes.
</P>
<P>
The eighth seed, who beat Kafelnikov in their last meeting at
the 1998 U.S. Open, kept control of his nerves as the match went
into the tiebreak.
</P>
<P>
Johansson wasted two match points, one with a double fault,
before winning a semifinal place against Richard Krajicek with a
sweet drop volley.
</P>
<P>
"It's very tough to go on court knowing if you win you are
number one," Johansson said. It was clear he was nervous but I
tried to stay focused all the time and concentrate on my own game.
"
</P>
<P>
In other matches of the day, Britain's Greg Rusedski played one
of the best matches of his life to beat Thomas Enqvist 7-5,4-6, 6-
3, Richard Krajicek swept aside Karol Kucera 6-1, 6-3 and Hicham
Arazi beat Dominik Hrbaty 6-4, 6-2 for the semi-finals.

<HEADLINE> Di Canio Facing Fresh FA Rap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Controversial Paolo Di Canio is
facing a reprimand from the Football Association after launching
another verbal assault on the referee he pushed over in a
sensational red-card incident last year.
</P>
<P>
The West Ham striker also reopened the war of words with his
former club Sheffield Wednesday, accusing them of stabbing him in
the back.
</P>
<P>
Di Canio was banned for 11 games for shoving referee Paul
Alcock to the floor in a Premiership match with Arsenal last
September. The incident brought a swift end to his Wednesday
career and he left for Upton Park for two million pounds without
playing for the Yorkshire side again.
</P>
<P>
He was widely criticised within the game over the high-profile
clash with authority, but Di Canio refuses to sit quietly by and
take the flak.
</P>
<P>
In an interview in the Italian press he was quoted as saying: "
I apologised to Mr. Alcock but I have suffered very serious
consequences, and the fact that he wants to denounce me can't help
to clear matters up.
</P>
<P>
"He claims he can't sleep properly any more, that he gets pins
and needles in his leg and that he has suffered a slipped disc.
</P>
<P>
"But then the same referee has previously been head-butted yet
he has been able to officiate for eight seasons without any
problems. Now he is suddenly suffering from insomnia," he added.
</P>
<P>
But the referee expressed disappointment that the matter had
resurfaced in the press and insisted Di Canio had never said sorry.
</P>
<P>
"I have never received a personal apology from Di Canio. By
that I mean a phone call or a letter," said Alcock.
</P>
<P>
"And as for his claims about my insomnia, the only sleep I've
ever lost over the last five months has been a result of physical
injury, not my mental state.
</P>
<P>
"I have the scans to prove I slipped a disc and I was out of
football for 10 weeks - nearly as long as he was."
</P>
<P>
The FA are determined to prevent any further public outbursts
by serving a warning on Di Canio in person.
</P>
<P>
FA spokesman Steve Double said: "The FA compliance officer,
Graham Bean, will be meeting with Paolo Di Canio next week to
discuss his remarks with a view to warning him about his future
conduct.
</P>
<P>
"We feel it is obviously time to draw a line under this episode,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Di Canio's attack on his former club was even more bitter, with
the Hillsborough players bearing the brunt of his fury for what he
perceives as their disloyalty.
</P>
<P>
"At one point I was devoured by anxiety at the thought of going
back to the club who had stabbed me in the back," he fumed.
</P>
<P>
"I decided to remain in England because I am a proud Italian
and did not want to run away.
</P>
<P>
"I made a mistake in pushing that referee but I did it to help
one of my team-mates - and afterwards none of them helped me.
</P>
<P>
"They didn't give a damn about me in the dressing room because
they were jealous of me," added Di Canio.
</P>
<P>
He also described Sheffield itself as a boring place to live in
and branded Wednesday's preparation for matches under manager
Danny Wilson as "absurd".

<HEADLINE> Ferguson: Friendlies Should be Scrapped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United manager Alex
Ferguson said on Friday that international friendly matches should
be abolished.
</P>
<P>
According to the BBC reports, Ferguson warned that friendlies
created an impossible job for any potential England manager - and
made the 'club versus country' question a problem for players and
teams alike.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important for the international team manager to
understand the club manager's point of view," Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
"And sometimes I think the FA councillors want the trips more
than the players.
</P>
<P>
"But all it means is they end up falling out with the managers,
"he said.
</P>
<P>
United, who clash with Inter Milan in next week's European
Champions Cup quarter-final, are currently top of the Premiership,
but Ferguson is taking nothing for granted.
</P>
<P>
"We know that we're in a fight," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I have great respect for what Arsene Wenger has done for
Arsenal and the same goes for (Gianluca) Vialli at Chelsea. He's
always someone I worry about."
</P>
<P>
On the question of Europe, Ferguson was adamant that United can
succeed and said he was not concerned whether Ronaldo is fit for
the match.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not afraid of Ronaldo," he said, before suggesting that
media stories regarding the Brazilian star's injury problems could
be misleading.
</P>
<P>
"You never know whether the Italians get up to those types of
games.
</P>
<P>
"Ronaldo obviously has injuries - his two knees have been
giving him problems and you can't dismiss that.
</P>
<P>
"You can't expect him to walk out on the pitch and feel 100%.
But I have a feeling that his club wants him to play," the manager
added.

<HEADLINE> Wembley Delay Threatens 2006 Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- England's hopes of staging the
2006 World Cup could be reduced by a delay in selling off Wembley,
shareholders in the national stadium have been warned.
</P>
<P>
The Football Association's planned purchase of Wembley, which
looked to have been completed last month, still has not gone ahead.
</P>
<P>
And with no imminent resolution on the cards, the FA's rival
for the buy-out, leisure group ENIC, has revealed it is "
continuing to monitor the Wembley situation" and said it has the
funds to launch an increased offer.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that a major redevelopment of the famous ground
will be the centrepiece of England's 2006 World Cup campaign.
</P>
<P>
The FA has until July to provide written details of its bid to
football's world governing body FIFA - including information on
the new stadium that will replace Wembley and could stage the
World Cup final.
</P>
<P>
But Alec McGivan, director of the 2006 World Cup campaign, told
The Times: "We do need a decision for the future. It is very
important for the bid. We do not want any further delay."
</P>
<P>
Shareholders of Wembley plc will consider the offer from the FA
- under its umbrella body the English National Stadium Development
Company - at its extraordinary general meeting on March 11.

<HEADLINE> Annan Regrets Resumption of Conflict in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Friday regretted the impasse in the Angola peace
process and the resumption of conflict, which have led to the
termination of the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola
(MONUA).
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his spokesman's office, Annan said
that since the conclusion of the Lusaka Protocol in November 1994,
the United Nations peacekeeping operations have contributed to
four years of relative peace, the longest such period the people
of Angola had ever enjoyed since its independence.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general believed that the United Nations can be
proud of its contribution, which gave the Angolan parties a unique
opportunity to achieve peace and national reconciliation, and it
was tragic that historic opportunity had not been seized by the
Angolan parties.
</P>
<P>
"With the steadily worsening security situation, and the
inability of MONUA to carry out its mandate, it had become
increasingly clear that, for the time being, the conditions for an
effective United Nations peacekeeping role in Angola had ceased to
exist," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations will not, however, abandon the people of
Angola and is prepared to continue and, if need be, increase its
humanitarian assistance, human rights and development activities,"
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief added the United Nations would stand ready to
offer its support again whenever the parties in conflict decide to
seek a peaceful settlement.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of fighting erupted in the country in December
1998, breaking down a 1994 peace accord to end years of civil war
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council Friday unanimously decided
to withdraw the MONUA from Angola following the U.N. failure to
persuade the Angolan government into accepting limited U.N.
presence there.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Reduces Some Warplanes Poised for Attack in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- There would be a small
reduction of U.S. attack and support warplanes near Yugoslavia,
the U.S. Defense Department said in brief statement on Friday.
</P>
<P>
But it said more than 240 fighter jets remained on alert within
range of battered Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department said it was Defense Secretary William
Cohen who had authorized re-deployment of five EA-6B "prowler"
electronic jamming jets from Europe to Whidbey Island Naval Air
Station in Washington State.
</P>
<P>
EA-6Bs were in major demand for U.S. mission overseas and the
jets were being returned to their base at Whidbey Island to
reduce "the stress on the aircraft, the crews and their
families," the Defense Department said.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that some 50 other U.S. jets sent to
the region earlier this month as a warning to Serb forces in and
near Kosovo will remain on station with other American and NATO
aircraft. These included a dozen radar-avoiding F-117A stealth
fighters in Iraly and seven heavy B-52 bombers in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. warplanes near Yugoslavia are part of a force of
more than 400 NATO attack and support aircraft poised for
possible action against Belgrade.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall Again On Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street Stocks fell
again Friday in fears that computer market would slow down and
the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates as well.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9,306.58, down
59.76, bringing its total losses to 246.09 points in the four
days since Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The plunge was led by a selloff in technology shares after
Compaq Computer, the world's largest personal computer maker,
warned that its sales have slowed so far this quarter. The
warning pushed its shares down nearly 6 points and shares for
IBM, Dell and other computer makers also fell sharply on
concern that their sales may also slow in coming months.
</P>
<P>
The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index was down
38.79 at 2,288.03 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 6.69 at 1,238.33.
</P>
<P>
Investors were also nervous about a possible raising of
interest rates by the Federal Reserve after the Commerce
Department readjusted the U.S. economic growth in the fourth
quarter of 1998 at 6.1 percent in annual rate, up from 5.6
percent. The Federal Reserve Chairman Allan Greenspan has said
that the Federal was ready to raise interest rates to cool off
the economy if the growth rate would not go lower.
</P>
<P>
Other major indexes were also lower. The NYSE index fell
0.97 at 586.46 while the American Stock Exchange index
dropped 4.82 at 698.29.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down
0.46 at 392.26.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Farm Price Down by One Percent in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The average price paid to
U.S. farmers for all agricultural products in February fell one
percent from January as prices for most crops continued to dive,
the Agriculture Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The average farm price was down five percent as compared with
the same month of last year.
</P>
<P>
Soybean price dropped to 4.83 U.S. dollars per bushel on
average in February, the lowest since March 1987, the department
said in its monthly Agricultural Prices report.
</P>
<P>
The farm price gauge was weighed down by sinking prices for
milk, tomatoes, corn and soybeans, the department said. But
farmers selling cattle, hogs, oranges and potatoes actually saw
price increases.
</P>
<P>
Prices paid for soybeans were down more than eight percent in
February from the previous month and 25 percent below prices paid
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In February, corn prices fell five cents to 2.01 dollars per
bushel on average, down 54 cents from a year ago. Wheat prices
also decreased, diving to 2.72 dollars per bushel, down eight
cents from January and 55 cents lower than prices paid last
February.
</P>
<P>
U.S. farmers have seen incomes swiftly decline over the past
year as an oversupply of grains and meat worldwide has combined
with declined demand for agricultural goods from countries facing
economic hardships.
</P>
<P>
Last year, U.S. Congress approved 5.9 billion dollars in
emergency spending for farmers and speculation has mounted that
another aid package may be needed this year to help some farmers
stay on the land.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Warns of NATO Act against Yugoslav Repression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Friday that NATO was "prepared to act" if Yogoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic continued to repress ethnic Albanians
in Kosovo before peace talks resume on March 15.
</P>
<P>
"President Milosevic should understand that this is a time
for restraint, not repression. And if he does not, NATO is
prepared to act," Clinton said in a foreign policy address in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came as tensions mounted in Kosovo over a buildup
of Serbian forces on its borders.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that progress had been made at the talks on Kosovo
peace earlier this month at Rambouillet, outside Paris, despite a
failure to reach a full peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
He said it was because independence-minded ethnic Albanian
leaders had agreed in principle to a deal that would give them
"substantial" self rule, while Serbia had agreed to may points,
though they remained opposed to NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Serbia's leaders must now accept that only by allowing
people in Kosovo control over their day-to-day lives, as after
all, they had been promised under Yugoslav law, it is only by
doing that can they keep their country intact," he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Certifies Mexico, Colombia as Anti-Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
certified to Congress on Friday that Mexico and Colombia were
cooperating partners in the fight against drug trafficking,
sparing them from U.S. sanctions, the State Department said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also put Nigeria, which was last year on the
noncertified list, on the list of cooperating countries but only
because such a decision was in the U.S. national interests, the
State Department added in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in San Francisco, Clinton publicly cited Mexico as a
fully cooperating partner in the fight against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
In a foreign policy address to California business leaders,
Clinton credited Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo, saying he
was "working hard to tackle the corruption traffickers."
</P>
<P>
Colombia is the world's biggest cocaine producer and a major
U.S. supplier of heroin.
</P>
<P>
Last year it was formally "certified" as a cooperating state
but only on the grounds of U.S. national interest. Since then
U.S. officials have praised the anti-drug efforts of Colombia's
President Andres Pastrana who took over last August.
</P>
<P>
By U.S. law, the president must judge the performance of all
foreign drug-producing and transiting countries by March. Any
countries not certified as fully cooperating would be hit with
economic penalties by the United States.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Find Mammal Breathing Through Skin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Researchers in Canada have
found that a newborn marsupial mouse relies more on its skin than
on its lungs to breathe.
</P>
<P>
The Australian marsupial mouse, named Julia Creek dunnart, is
the first mammal so far shown to breathe through its skin, Jacopo
Mortola and colleagues from McGill University, Canada, reported in
the latest issue of the science journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
The unique physiological feat of the marsupial mouse will help
future studies of breathing in all mammals, the researchers
believed.
</P>
<P>
The Julia Creek dunnart gives birth to one of the tiniest of
newborn mammals. Only 4 millimeters long at birth, and weighing
around 17 milligrams, baby dunnarts are born before their lungs
are fully functional.
</P>
<P>
When the baby dunnart crawls from its mother's womb to her
pouch, its lungs are fully formed, but its muscles are too weak to
inflate them.
</P>
<P>
So to make up the difference, the baby dunnart breathes through
its skin, the scientists have found.
</P>
<P>
By enclosing newborn dunnarts in an ingeniously contrived
manometer, the scientists found that gas exchange into blood
vessels in the fine hairless skin exceeds that through the lungs.
</P>
<P>
The baby dunnarts' skin absorbs 50 times as much as oxygen as
their lungs. It was not until the animals were 20 days old that
their lungs were contributing about two-thirds of respiratory
needs.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other mammals, the baby dunnart can survive by using its
skin simply because it is very small and so surface area is large
in proportion to volume, the scientists explained.

<HEADLINE> PM: Bright Future Ahead for Sino-Russian Economic  Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
here Friday that Sino-Russian trade and economic cooperation will
advance to a brand new level as long as both sides work together
to give full play to advantages in their complementary economies.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, addressing a luncheon with about 100 Russian business
leaders, expressed confidence that such cooperation will be
further strengthened under the bilateral strategic partnership of
cooperation based on equality and mutual trust and oriented toward
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier is here on a four-day official visit, his
first to Russia since assuming premiership last March.
</P>
<P>
He met Thursday with Russian President Boris Yeltsin and held
the fourth regular meeting between the premiers of the two
countries together with his Russian counterpart, Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said President Yeltsin's remarks on the bright future of
bilateral trade and economic cooperation will give a fresh impetus
to the development of such cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The premier said his cordial, candid and substantial talks with
Primakov also yielded broad consensus on cooperation in various
areas, especially in economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed 11 documents on oil, natural gas,
electricity, transportation and regional cooperation at the end of
the premiers' meeting.
</P>
<P>
Friday's luncheon was hosted by Russian First Deputy Prime
Minister Yuri Maslyukov.
</P>
<P>
He said Zhu's visit has been a complete success as both sides
have settled many problems and opened up cooperation in such new
areas as direct investment, joint production of household electric
appliances and distribution of consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu said Russia commands top superiority in high-tech
areas such as space and that as long as the two sides trust each
other and strengthen cooperation, such superiority will lay a good
foundation for the speedy growth of economic and trade
collaboration.
</P>
<P>
He said the two premiers have reached sincere understanding in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
Zhu left Moscow later Friday for St. Petersburg, Russia's
second largest city, where he was scheduled to meet Governor
Vladimir Yakovlev and tour the local Izhorskiye Zavody
machine-building factory.
