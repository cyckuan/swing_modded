<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM to Attend OIC Meeting in Iran </HEADLINE>

<P>
CAIRO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa has said that he would go to Tehran next month to attend a
ministerial meeting of Islamic countries, in a first such visit by
a senior Egyptian official to Iran in 18 years.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East News Agency today quoted Moussa as saying that
he would lead Egypt's delegation to the meetings of the foreign
ministers of the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) to be
held in the Iranian capital of Tehran on December 6-7.
</P>
<P>
The meetings will be held to prepare for the 8th OIC summit
which will start on December 9 and last for three days.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Embassy in Cairo said in a statement earlier that
27 heads of state, three monarchs, seven premiers, three crown
princes and four vice-presidents will take part in the upcoming
Islamic summit.
</P>
<P>
The Jeddah-based OIC, established in 1970 with a view to
rallying the ranks of the Islamic world, holds a summit meeting
every three years.
</P>
<P>
Moussa's visit will be the first of a senior Egyptian official
to Iran since the Iranian Islamic Revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Tehran severed political ties with Cairo since 1979, the year
Egypt signed its peace treaty with Israel. But the upcoming summit
in the Iranian capital will show how much progress has been made
since 1991, when the two countries established interest section in
their respective state.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Leader to Meet Blair in Downing Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Gerry Adams, leader of the
political wing Sinn Fein of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), is to
meet with British Prime Minister Tony Blair at his Downing Street
office on December 11.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be the first between an Irish republican
leader and a British prime minister since 1921.
</P>
<P>
A Downing Street spokesman said today Blair was "determined to
drive forward the peace process and believes it is vital to keep
up the momentum."
</P>
<P>
He said Blair would use the meeting to discuss the state of
all-party peace talks in Belfast, to which Sinn Fein was admitted
for the first time in September after the IRA renewed a cease-fire
in July.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister will... stress once more the absolute
necessity of a continuing commitment to exclusively peaceful
means," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein wants to unite Northern Ireland with the Republic of
Ireland and its IRA guerrilla wing has fought a violent campaign
against the British rule in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Blair's spokesman said the planned meeting was part of routine
contacts between the prime minister and Northern Irish party
leaders in Northern Ireland. The two men will not pose for
photographs.
</P>
<P>
The announcement reflects a remarkable turnaround in official
British perceptions of Adams, who was held in jail in the 1970s as
a guerrilla suspect and whose voice was banned from being heard in
Britain for several years until 1994.

<HEADLINE> UN Arms Inspectors Continue Mission in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations arms
inspection teams continued today its missions in Iraq for the
eighth consecutive day after Iraq allowed them back on November
21, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Some 12 teams searched 20 sites, including eight not marked for
inspection, in different remote areas, Hussam Mohammed Amin, head
of the Iraqi department assisting the U.N. inspection work, told
the agency.
</P>
<P>
Iraq provided the teams with all possible facilities without
delay or any problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. teams have so far inspected 116 sites in Iraq since
November 22, which were all carried out smoothly without
interference from the Iraqi side, U.N. experts, who asked not to
be named, were quoted by the agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Amin expressed the hope that U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM)
in charge of eliminating weapons of mass destruction in Iraq would
take into consideration the results of the inspection and Iraq's
full cooperation while evaluating the position of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM is to verify that Iraq has dismantled all its
weapons of mass destruction. Only then will the U.N. Security
Council lift the crippling economic sanctions, including a ban on
oil export, imposed on Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the agency said that the U.S. U2 spy plane intruded
into the Iraqi airspace this morning.
</P>
<P>
It flew at a high altitude over Karbala Governorate, southwest
of the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, then headed for the northern
areas of Al-Tuz, Arbil and Ninwi Governorate. It later turned to
the west and south.
</P>
<P>
An official Iraqi spokesman said that the country's air defense
force was tracking the plane.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that such U.S. act will not scare Iraq or force
it to cede its legitimate rights, and that it will prove a failure.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has said it will shoot down any U.S. U2 plane that
intrudes its airspace, while the United States has threatened to
make tough response to Iraqi moves.

<HEADLINE> Steel Fence to Be Built Around Diana's Island Grave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- A two-meter high steel cordon
with thousands of heart-shaped motif is to be erected around the
island where Diana, Princess of Wales, is buried before her
ancestral home is opened to the public in the summer.
</P>
<P>
Diana's brother, Earl Charles Spencer, has submitted designs
for the gates to the local planning authority near the Althorp
estate in Northamptonshire, central England, said a local press
report today.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the barrier was to control crowds wanting
to see the island, surrounded by an ornamental lake, where Diana
was buried, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The heart motif reflects Diana's stated desire, two years
before her death, to become a "queen of people's hearts."
</P>
<P>
Spencer plans to open the grounds of Althorp House, where Diana
was born and spent her childhood, for two months next summer.
Thousands of people are expected to visit the country park and a
proposed museum about her life and charity work.
</P>
<P>
The 16-century Althorp House is expected to become one of
Britain's biggest visitor attractions when it opens on July 1 --
Diana's birthday -- until the first anniversary of her death in a
Paris car crash on August 31.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Trade Unions Threatens to Act over New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions (ZCTU) said today that it will embark on a mass action to
protest the Zimbabwean government's imposition of an extra levy
on the already over-burdened tax-payers.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance announced on Friday
that the government has approved rises in sales tax and fuel
duties plus a second five percent levy on income tax to raise
additional revenue to pay war veterans gratuities and pensions.
</P>
<P>
According to the new levy, all goods and services now
attracting 15 percent sales tax will be levied at the rate of
17.5 percent in sales tax. Sales tax on electricity rises from
five percent to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new levy will raise the effective maximum rate of income
tax on individuals from 42 percent to 44 percent. For companies
the effective rate of tax on income will be 41.25 percent, up
from the present 39.375 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Since the government has seen no reason to negotiate itself
out of its own mess, the ZCTU will embark on a rolling mass
action," said ZCTU President Gibson Sibanda.
</P>
<P>
Sibanda told reporters that ZCTU deplored the decision by the
government to impose an extra levy on the already over-burdened
tax payers.
</P>
<P>
The total disregard for the plight of people had undermined
the legitimacy of the government, he said.
</P>
<P>
Having assessed the opinion of the workers, he said, the ZCTU
concluded that the government's action is tantamount to
confrontation with the workers.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the government has various options amongst which
are to reduce the size of the cabinet, rationalising ministries
and foreign missions, find options within the budget and recover
from those that looted the war victims fund. What is crucial is
a government that sets its priorities right," said the ZCTU
president.

acquisition of a new car or an equivalent tax break for those not
intending to buy another.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Most Greeks Favor Death Penalty for Drug Dealers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- A recent poll shows that 75
percent of Greeks support the resumption of death penalty for drug
dealers, according to Greece's Athens News newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which was released Friday, was conducted recently
with 1,400 people nationwide being interviewed.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that the level of support for the return of
capital punishment for drug traffickers was generally higher among
women, religious people, the less educated and Greeks living in
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
About 75 percent of respondents now believe that drugs are too
readily available while 76 percent found the law enforcements
"ineffective" or "very ineffective" in their efforts against drug
dealers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, 69 members of the Greek parliament signed a
petition calling for the death penalty, which was scrapped three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
But the Greek government has refused to do so. Greek Justice
Minister Evangelos Yiannopoulos said recently that the government
had succeeded in combating drugs at schools and in other areas.

<P>
TORONTO, Canada, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President
Jiang Zemin left here today for Mexico for a state visit to the
country after paying a four-day state visit to Canada.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 representatives from the Chinese community and
Canadian officials saw Jiang and his entourage off at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Jiang started his first visit to Canada Wednesday after taking
part in the fifth leaders' informal meeting of the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Vancouver Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After signing a series of agreements on economic cooperation
and trade in Ottawa, Jiang arrived here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Early today, speaking at a breakfast hosted by Premier Mike
Harris of Ontario, Jiang said, "Although our stay here is brief,
we have fully experienced the friendship of the government and
people of the province of Ontario to the people of China."
</P>
<P>
Ontario plays an important and positive role in the economic,
trade, scientific and technological, and cultural exchanges
between China and Canada, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
China's Jiangsu Province is twinned with Ontario; Chongqing
Municipality, with Toronto; and Ma'anshan city, with Hamilton. The
province is also the hometown of Doctor Norman Bethune admired and
respected by the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"All these have vigorously enhanced mutual understanding
between the two sides and promoted the friendship between the two
peoples," Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
"Upon concluding my visit to Canada, I would like to take this
opportunity to express once again our profound thanks to the

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Rebel Leader Blames Government for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- A leading Sudanese rebel leader
today blamed the Sudanese government for the collapse of the
recent round of peace negotiations held in Kenyan capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
"It failed because of (Sudanese President Omar al-) Bashir's
concept of a unified Sudan without any care whatsoever for the
multi-ethnic and multi-religion groups in Sudan," John Garang, who
is currently on a visit to Egypt, said in an interview with the
Egyptian newspaper Al Ahram.
</P>
<P>
Garang is the leader of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army
(SPLA), a major rebel group in southern Sudan, which took up arms
in 1983 to press for greater autonomy for the southern third of
the Africa's largest country.
</P>
<P>
He said that he has proposed to set up a confederation of the
Muslim north and the Christian south to maintain the unity of
Sudan, which he said is his first goal.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government reportedly rejected the proposal in the
peace talks, which ended early this month in Nairobi without
reaching an agreement to end the civil war. More than 1 million
people has been killed in the war.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Sudan's Justice Minister Abdul-Basit Sabdarat, who
is attending a conference here, said that Khartoum does not object
to Garang's ongoing visit as Egypt is believed to be concerned
with Sudan's unity.
</P>
<P>
Sabdarat's remarks coincided with a thaw in the relations
between Egypt and Sudan, the two Nile valley states.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here said that a senior Egyptian official,
possibly Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, will visit Khartoum in the
coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
Moussa has said that Cairo is keen to pursue rapprochement with
Sudan, which it has accused of harboring Islamic militants to
overthrow the Egyptian secular government.

<P>
DAR ES SlAAM, November 29 (Xinhua) -- An opposition leader has
urged Tanzanian religious leaders to refrain from participating
in political rallies, " The Guardian" reportred today.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the Provisionally Registered Union for
Democracy in Tanzania, Makimbo Kaoneka, has said that there was a
growing tendency among religious leaders to attend and even
address political rallies.
</P>
<P>
Of late, some religious leaders have covertly participated in
politics by conveying their political massages through religious
preachings, Kaoneka told a press conference in Dar es Salaam
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
" It is dangerous for them to do so", the paper quoted Kaoneka
as saying, without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
He said religious leaders who opt for politics should abandon
preaching the Gospel and join political parties.
</P>
<P>
Kaoneka was referring to Reverend Zakaria kakobe of the Full
Gospel Church and Sheikh Khalifa, who represented their religious
groups during the recent opposition parties rally held at
Jangwani grounds to press for constitutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the current debate on constitutional amendment,
Kaoneka said that his party fully supports the move.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian
authorities have rounded up more than 33,000 people classified as
illegal aliens in a major crackdown in the northwest region.
</P>
<P>
Vincent Parker, spokesman for the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told a news conference on
Friday that a total of 33,952 people had been arrested so far.
</P>
<P>
Some 20,304 people were rounded up in Kigoma region, 11,088 in
Ngara and 2,200 in Kasulu district, he was quoted by press
reports today.
</P>
<P>
Parker said the bulk of those detained had been registered as
refugees and returned to camps.
</P>
<P>
Of the 20,304 rounded up in Kigoma, some 10,878 are Congoless,
9,407 are Burundians and 19 are Rwandans.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said, UNHCR is concerned about the
arbitrary nature of the operation and is liaising with the
Tanzanian authorities to verify the status of those detained.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the round-up, one area we're very much concerned
about is the need to have status-determining procedures to sort
out who is a legitimate refugee," Parker noted.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the UNHCR re-launched its voluntary repatriation
operation of 74,000 Congolese.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese repatriation which started in September was
suspended at the end of October because of the UNHCR concern over
excessive interference by Congolese officials especially with
regard to verifying the security of refugees.

MOSCOW, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin today chaired a meeting of the military reform
commission to discuss the concept of military construction, the
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said the concept of military construction drafted
together by the Defense Ministry, the General Staff and other
agencies identifies the tasks facing the armed forces in the
foreseeable future, as well as how the Russian army and navy
should be organized up to the year 2005."
</P>
<P>
He noted this is the first such document since the 1930s and
ordered the Defense Ministry to finalize the draft and re-submit
it to the commission on December 5, 1997.
</P>
<P>
State military inspector and Defense Council secretary Andrei
Kokoshin said the commission "gave an overall approval to the
concept of military construction."
</P>
<P>
Kokoshin noted that this is an "important step towards building
a concept of military development the draft of which is being
prepared by the commission in keeping with President Boris
Yeltsin's decision."
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev described the concept as a
"unique document." "For the first time in the history of our
country, we have worked out and formalized a set of fundamental
provisions which determine the shape of Russia's military
organization under a single state policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said the ultimate goal of military reform is to
"create a rational and efficient military organization capable of
ensuring Russia's defense and security."
</P>
<P>
Another task identified in the concept is the creation of a
single system of state patriotic, military, ethical and legal
training in order to raise the prestige of military service.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the main guarantee of successful
military reform is the unity of material and spiritual aspects of
military construction.

<HEADLINE> Dysentery, Cholera Claim 33 Lives at Tanzanian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-three people
have died of dysentery and cholera over the past two years at
Mererani Village, a major mining area in Tanzania, due to poor
sanitation, The Guardian reported today.
</P>
<P>
Dysentery has been a leading killer disease in Mererani
because of poor water supply, particularly in the mining area,
local medical officer Thadeus Eweyemanu told a team of Media
Women Association who visited the village two days ago.
</P>
<P>
About 2,174 people were admitted to 14 dispensaries in
Mererani, 22 of whom died, Ewiyemanu said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that nine of the 11 people died of cholera
between August and October this year, were from the mines.
</P>
<P>
The medical officer put the blame to the miners most of whom
are stubborn, saying "They don't use toilets and care very little
about their health."
</P>
<P>
Poor medical services have also contributed to the death toll,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Small-scale miners have flocked to the village in the northern
Arusha region in recent years exploiting gemstones without paying
taxes to the government, the paper added.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Employ Chinese Special Zone Expertise: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Minister of Electricity
and Energy Maher Abaza said today his country will employ Chinese
expertise in building its own special economic zone in the
northwest of the Gulf of Suez.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has allocated about 300 million pounds (about 100 million
U.S. dollars) for construction of such infrastructure elements as
road, water and electricity leading up to the 160 square
kilometers zone, as a feasibility study conducted with the Chinese
side for the project is under way, the minister told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a meeting today with Egyptian Prime Minister
Kamal el-Ganzouri, Chinese Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation Liu Shanzai said the special economic zones
have been a hallmark of the Chinese reform and opening program.
</P>
<P>
Liu made the remarks in a joint press briefing together with
Abaza.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the Chinese government is keen on boosting cooperation
with Egypt through participation in implementing the Gulf of Suez
special zone project, which will be a good way to help improve the
trade balance and elevate bilateral economic cooperation to a
level commensurable to the two countries' political ties.
</P>
<P>
"China will also offer its experiences and lessons, management,
personnel training and counseling to Egypt in conducting this
project," said Liu, who is visiting Egypt at the head of a Chinese
governmental delegation which also includes businessmen.
</P>
<P>
He said Beijing will give its answer to a new proposal by
Premier Ganzouri on setting up two Sino-Egyptian joint ventures in
the fields of infrastructure construction and investment service
in the Gulf of Suez zone.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri, impressed by what he saw during his visit to several
Special Economic Zones in China last April, advocated taking
advantage of the Chinese savvy in Egypt's economic reform. Egypt
has signed an agreement with China on cooperation in setting up
the zone.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Chinese joint committee for developing the Gulf of
Suez zone is in session under the co-chairmen of Abaza and Liu to
outline the economic feasibility studies and plan infrastructure
in the region together.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are expected to sign an agreement Sunday on
conducting a general planning for the special zone.
</P>
<P>
During their week-long visit that began on November 25, the
Chinese entrepreneurs have reached several agreements of
cooperation with their Egyptian counterparts on infrastructure
construction, cement production, as well as production of water
treatment equipments in Egypt.

<HEADLINE> China Plans To Build More Railways In Southwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Now that the Nanning-Kunming
Railway opened today, China plans to build more key railways in
the southwestern part of the country, according to Ye Qing,
vice-minister of the State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Ye said that China electrified railways in that region in the
early 1990s, and that new railways will improve transportation in
the mountainous area, and that will help both local and national
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Railways scheduled for construction or renovation in the near
future include the Daxian-Wanxian Line, the Neijiang-Kunming Line,
the Huaihua-Chongqing Line, and the Zhijin-Huangtong Line.
</P>
<P>
Southwest China has many mineral and energy resources, but the
poor transportation has hindered its development. But, this
construction work was helped by the central government's policy of
narrowing the gap between western parts of the country and more
prosperous eastern provinces.
</P>
<P>
When the construction work is completed, the region will have
an opportunity to increase co-operation with Southeast Asian
countries like Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar, Ye said, and
will be able to open wider to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
China can make use of these countries' abundant resources and
huge markets, he said, in addition to which, the new railways will
connect with the Pan-Asia Railway, and become a part of the
Euroasian Continental Bridge.
</P>
<P>
The 898.5-km Nanning-Kunming Railway is the longest electrified
single-track trunk railway in China. It crosses some
underdeveloped parts of Yunnan and Guizhou provinces and the
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Cities and counties along the railway line are expected to
benefit a great deal from it.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 30 (Xinhua) -- A high-level Yemeni
delegation led by Deputy Prime Minister Abdul-karim al-Iryani
arrived in Saudi Arabia today to discuss protracted border
dispute between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Riyadh said that al-Iryani, also
Yemeni Foreign Minister, would deliver a letter from Yemeni
President Ali Abdullah Saleh to Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz
during his meeting with the king.
</P>
<P>
The letter reportedly deals with bilateral relations and the
ongoing efforts exerted to settle the land and maritime border
dispute between the two countries, according to Kuwait News
Agency.
</P>

The agency quoted diplomatic sources as saying that the letter
also tackles the border shooting accident occurred earlier this

<HEADLINE> Seoul, IMF Expected to Conclude Talks Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government and
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are expected to conclude the
ongoing negotiations on terms for the IMF bailout funds soon.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed in principle on supplying Seoul with
the first tranche of IMF funds in four to five days, South Korean
government officials told reporters here today.
</P>
<P>
However, South Korean Minister of Finance and Economy Lim
Chang-yuel told reporters that the two sides remained different
concerning the pace and intensity of South Korean economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Though the details of the IMF conditions are not available yet,
ministry officials said that the IMF-suggested terms include
lowering South Korea's gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate to
around 2.5 percent instead of the 4.8 percent offered by Seoul.
</P>
<P>
South Korea explained that an unprecedented low growth rate of
less than 4 percent is feared to bring with huge side-effect such
as social unstability due to the high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The IMF also demanded Seoul's current-account deficit be
reduced to below 1 percent of the GDP and the inflation rate be
kept at below 5 percent, ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides showed difference on the issue of liquidating
troubled financial institutions. The IMF strongly demands that
some insolvent banks as well as several ailing merchant banks be
liquidated.
</P>
<P>
But the South Korean side wants a softer measure on the issue,
citing enormous negative impact of banks' liquidation on the
overall economy.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean side also complained that a 10 percent cut in
the government general budget the IMF demanded will make the
government difficult to assist the restructuring in the financial
sector.
</P>
<P>
However, local experts said that the two sides are expected to
reach an agreement by compromises such as setting the growth rate
at the 3 percent mark.
</P>
<P>
Lim said that the IMF bailout package, aimed at easing a
foreign exchange crisis, would eventually be far more than 20
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the exact amount of the IMF bailout package is expected to
be finalized after consultations between Seoul and IMF managing
director in Seoul later this week, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
"We decided to provide a sufficient amount of IMF funds to
Seoul as early as possible, earlier than originally scheduled,"
Hubert Neiss, chief IMF delegate, told reporters, adding that the
United States and Japan have agreed to participate in the IMF
bailout package.

<HEADLINE> UN Arms Inspection Work Continues in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Ten monitoring groups of the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) and the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) continued their inspection missions smoothly
today in Iraq, the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The teams today inspected 21 suspected sites in Iraq, including
seven sites which are not covered by long-term monitoring, said
INA.
</P>
<P>
According to Hussam Mohammed Ameen, Director General of the
Iraqi National Monitoring Department, one U.N. arms inspection
group had been helicoptered to the inspection site despite Iraqi
authorities' warning of bad weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
Another monitoring group canceled its mission after their
helicopter was caught in a rain storm on its mid-way to the
inspection site, Ameen added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the inspection groups had done their job smoothly
for nine consecutive days, with the full cooperation of Iraq,
adding that no problems and delays were reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official called on the special commission to
thoroughly examine the results of its daily inspections to help
build confidence between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Ameen said the results were in congruence with Iraqi
declarations and proved "beyond any doubt" falsity of American
claims on prohibited activities in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The arms inspection teams had to verify that Iraq has
eliminated all its weapons of mass destruction before the
U.N.-imposed sanctions against Iraq can be lifted.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions imposed following Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in
1990 barred Iraq from exporting oil, its economic mainstay.

However, hours after Sajjad's order, Justice Siddqui issued a
press release this evening saying he declines to accept Sajjad's
order because it "amounts to interference with judicial process."
</P>
<P>
Justice Siddiqui leads the group of judges who suspended or
endorsed the suspension of Chief Justice Sajjad after taking up
direct petitions against him four days ago.
</P>
<P>
The suspension order has been rejected by Sajjad who along with
few other judges issued counter judgments leading to the most
devastating judicial factionalism in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
Ordering the full court cancellation, Sajjad said today in his
order, it was essential "to save the system" and "mandatory to
ensure establishment of rule of law."
</P>
<P>
"This is the only way in which the institution of the Supreme
Court can be saved from damage and erosion," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Justice also accused the government of preventing him
from proceeding against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in contempt
and corruption cases.
</P>
<P>
"To prevent me and other judges from deciding these cases,
steps have been taken to divert the attention of the people and
question of validity of my appointment as the Chief Justice has
been raised," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stated that he was appointed the Chief Justice on June 5,
1994, out of turn, as he was number four on the seniority list.
</P>
<P>
"No judge, senior to me felt aggrieved, resigned, or opted to
retire as a mark of protest, which means that my appointment as
Chief Justice was accepted for all intents and purposes," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Attempts have been made to create a rift among the judges so
that they should be divided and the events show that it has been
done with a substantial amount of success," he added.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Extends Winning Streak in China's Soccer League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Shenhua extended its
winning streak to four on Sunday while Qingdao Hainiu was still to
reap its first victory as the Chinese Professional Soccer League
resumed its competitions since November 16.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai trounced Vanguard Huandao 3-0 thanks to Wu Chengying's
pair whereas Qingdao suffered its fourth straight defeat of 0-3
against Guangzhou Apollo with a first-half triple by Peng Weiguo
and Tan Ende.
</P>
<P>
Shenhua unleashed earlier unstoppable attempts and the account
was opened with defender Wu Chengying's left-foot shot in the 25th
minute, which bounced off the post and into the net. Bian Jun
made it a two-goal lead just two minutes before the break.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who was called up to China's national team during the World
Cup playoffs but played only one match, sealed the victory with
his second goal three minutes before the time.
</P>
<P>
Shenhua slipped down by one step on the league standings as
Beijing Guo'an clinched the second place on goal differentials.
Both Shenhua and Guo'an have 29 points apiece with the latter
played one more game.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao lost its second match of the week as the lower-ranked
Guangzhou scored three times in 24 minutes in the opening half.
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Peng Weiguo initiated the onslaught by bending in an
angled free-kick into the right corner of the net just one minute
into the game.
</P>
<P>
Four minutes later, Wen Zhijun hit the ball against the leg of
teammate Peng which bounced into the net before the defenders of
the visiting squad even attempted their interception.
</P>
<P>
Tan Ende scored the third in the 24th minute in close range
from Australian Robert's flank cross.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's other matches, Beijing Guo'an tied Tianjun Samsung
1-1, Jinan Taishan edged Sichuan Quanxing 2-1, and Yanbian Aodong
beat Chinese Army 2-0.
</P>
<P>
Dalian Wanda remained atop of the standings with 42 points from
16 matches as it extended its unbeaten record to 50 this Wednesday
with a convincing 4-0 victory over Sichuan.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Method Of Cheating On Exams Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- A tiny book that was
discovered recently in the city of Nanjing, in east China's
Jiangsu province, has been found to be one that could be used to
cheat during national examinations.
</P>
<P>
The 68-page book is about a twelfth the size of an ordinary
book, but has approximately 80,000 characters, each about the size
of the head of a pin.
</P>
<P>
During an examination, the examinee could easily hide the book
in his pocket and sneak a peek at it if the correct answer did not
come readily to mind.
</P>
<P>
The book was printed at least 100 years ago during the rein of
Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), according to
experts.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese imperial government used to hold national
examinations annually to decide who would become officials for the
imperial court. Those who did very well would receive an
appointment from the emperor. So the examination was vital as a
means for ordinary people to rise in social status and take part
in political life.
</P>
<P>
The examination dealt with Confucian doctrine, and examinees
had to memorize every word of the master, so the tiny books might
have come in handy for a dull-witted person.
</P>
<P>
The most difficult and complex examination system was abolished
at the turn of the century because of many problems in the modern
age.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Calls on UN to Respect its Sovereignty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has issued a communique
calling on the U.N. Security Council to respect its sovereignty
and accept its invitation to international observers to visit
Iraqi presidential palaces.
</P>
<P>
The communique was issued after Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein had a meeting Saturday night with Vice Chairman of the
Revolutionary Command Council Izzat Ibrahim and some members of
the National Command of the ruling Baath Party, the official
Iraqi News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The communique underscored Iraq's commitment to cooperate with
the U.N. Security Council and the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) in charge of eliminating weapons of mass destruction in
Iraq, saying that Iraq had fulfilled its obligations under
relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council resolutions, particularly resolution
687, guarantee respect of Iraq's sovereignty, and presidential
palaces are components of the very essence of Iraq's sovereignty,
said the communique.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government decided on November 26 to invite teams
from countries with representation in the U.N. Security Council
and the UNSCOM to visit the presidential palaces.
</P>
<P>
So far, Iraq has not allowed U.N. weapons inspection teams to
enter its presidential sites, while the Unite States insists that
Iraq should allow U.N. arms inspectors to enter any places
without delays.

<P>
CHANGSHA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The first-stage project of a
flood protection program has been completed at Dongting Lake, one
of China's largest freshwater lakes, on the middle reaches of the
Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Several major tributaries flow into the Yangtze via Dongting
Lake, on the northern part of Hunan Province, and often cause
severe flooding in the big river, threatening the lives of many
people living along the lower reaches.
</P>
<P>
The most recent flood occurred last year as a result of rising
water level in four tributaries, taking a heavy toll of lives and
causing an immense amount of damage.
</P>
<P>
The newest project has been going on for the past decade and
has strengthened dykes and allows the lake to hold more water,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1.16 billion yuan (139.76 million US dollars) has
been spent on new facilities that included a modern communications
and warning system.
</P>
<P>
The launching of the second phase of the program has been
approved after a number of officials of the relevant government
departments and experts in the field of water conservation and
flood control gave appraisals to the project this month.

<HEADLINE> Nyerere Urges College Graduates Depend on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The father of the
Tanzanian nation, Julius Nyerere, has called on college graduates
to depend on themselves rather than hunting for jobs everywhere.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, former President of Tanzania, made the call shortly
after he was conferred with a Doctorate degree by the Sokoine
University of Agriculture (SUA) on Friday for his contribution to
the development of the country and other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, who served as Chancellor of SUA at one time, said
education focusing on self-reliance remains to be a key solution
to the high unemployment rate in the country.
</P>
<P>
He urged the educated to look at agriculture where there is
vast potential for employment, saying that its success is the
back-bone of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture contributes more than one half of the country's
gross domestic product (GDP) and accounts for more than 70
percent of the exports.
</P>
<P>
The former president suggested professionals initiate and
carry out their own projects instead of moving around with their
certificates in search of jobs.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere admitted that at present it is more difficult for some
highly educated people to secure their jobs than before.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, it does not mean Tanzania has enough trained
people and will no longer need the educated.
</P>
<P>
"In fact the country needs more educated people than ever
before... the market is even wider," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere also urged academic institutions to offer programs in
line with the market demand.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian and British armies
today held a joint military exercise featuring anti-tank
technology in a desert south of Amman.
</P>
<P>
Some 250 combined troops took part in the exercise near the
city of Qatranah to wound up the military cooperation between the
two countries within this year, British Ambassador to Jordan
Christopher Battiscombe told Xinhua at the exercise field, about
100 kilometers south of Amman.
</P>
<P>
During the military game, advanced anti-tank missiles were
used to crash a dozen targets set in the desert.
</P>
<P>
British Lieutenant Colonel Jim Dutton told reporters that
"this is not a peacekeeping training but a real war training"
and it was conducted without specific, real-life targets.
</P>
<P>
Second Secretary of the British Embassy in Jordan Charles
Heatly told Xinhua that Jordan and Britain held regular military
games every year. Last year there were three such kind of games
and the present one was the third between the two sides within
this year.
</P>
<P>
Battiscombe said that the British army "will continue to
train with the Jordanian army in the future on regular basis."
</P>
<P>
Jordan's official news agency Petra earlier reported that the
month-long exercise was aimed at enhancing the kingdom's defense
capabilities.

<P>
HELSINKI, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Bjarte Engen Vik of Norway
skied to the victory on Sunday in a Nordic Combined World Cup
event in Rovaniemi, Finland.
</P>
<P>
Vik, starting second on the 15-kilometer cross country behind
Austria's Mario Stecher, closed the gap of 30 seconds during the
first few kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The two stayed together for a few kilometers until Vik pulled
away and won by 1 minute and 22.1 seconds.
</P>
<P>
However, Stecher led the World Cup standings after the two
first events of the season tied with Hannu Manninen of Finland
with 235 points while Vik was third overall with 225 points.
</P>
<P>
Vik, 26, did not ski well in the sprint event, where he lost to
Stecher on the 7.5-kilometer course. On the double distance, the

<HEADLINE> Global Warming May Raise Sea Levels: Japanese Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 30 (Xinhua) -- If emissions of global warming
gases continue at the current rate, the average annual temperature
in Japan would rise 2 to 3 degrees Celsius 70 years from now,
putting more than 4 million people in Tokyo and Osaka at risk from
high tides, Japan's Environment Agency warned today.
</P>
<P>
Under such a catastrophic scenario, 109 trillion yen (about
858.3 billion U.S. dollars) worth of assets, such as land and
buildings, in Japan's big cities would be drowned, the agency
warned.
</P>
<P>
A rise in sea levels would hit island countries in the South
Pacific hardest and 17 percent of Bangladesh would be buried under
water, it said.
</P>
<P>
The agency also predicted that wheat and corn would plunge in
China and India, while Japan's food self-sufficiency rate could
drop below the current 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
A reduction of snowfall as a result of continuing greenhouse
gas emissions would increase the chances of drought and a water
shortage, while typhoons and torrential rains would become
stronger, the agency added.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Indian President Kocheril
Raman Narayanan today continued consultations with constitutional
experts in a bid to find a solution to the present political
impasse in the country after the fall of the United Front
government on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The seven-month-old minority government led by Prime Minister
Inder Kumar Gujral resigned after its key ally, the Congress party
withdrew support to it over an investigative report on the
assassination of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991.
</P>
<P>
In defiance of the Congress party demand, the United Front has
refused to drop one of its constituents, the Dravida Munnetra
Kazagham (DMK) from its government though it was indicted by the
report for being linked with the assassination.
</P>
<P>
According to Press Trust of India, President Narayanan will
meet leaders of the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and
its allied parties this evening and listen to their views on how
to go about the issue.
</P>
<P>
Following the resignation of the Gujral government, BJP, the
largest party in the parliament, has yet made a decision on
whether to stake claim to form government, saying that it keeps
its options open.
</P>
<P>
Narayanan will also meet leaders of the 13-party United Front
and the Congress party on Monday as part of the consultation
process.
</P>
<P>
The president on Saturday held discussions with
Attorney-general Ashok Desai, Lok Sabha (the lower house of
parliament) Speaker P.A. Sangma and Chief Election Commissioner
M.S. Gill.
</P>
<P>
So far only the Congress party has staked claim to form a new
government.

<HEADLINE> Technological Renovation Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese state councillor has
asked workers, farmers, government employees and scientists to
participate in a national technological renovation program.
</P>
<P>
Song Jian, who is in charge of the State Science and Technology
Commission, speaking at a national conference on patents that
closed in Beijing today, said that China was famous for its great
inventions in ancient times, like the art of printing, but has
fallen behind the West in science and technology since the Ming
Dynasty some 300 years ago. This, in turn, has led to poverty, he
said.
</P>
<P>
And, although China has become better at inventing new things
since 1949 when the People's Republic was founded, he noted, steps
should be taken to get people to come up with new scientific ideas.
</P>
<P>
He said that a lack of technological renovation is one of the
reasons why some state-owned enterprises can not make a profit,
and that this will threaten China's strategic goals for the next
century.
</P>
<P>
It is not only scientists and engineers who can invent things,
Song said, but also workers, farmers, and even school students can
do the job, and many of them have even applied for national
patents. There should not be any fear of the difficulties, he
concluded.

<HEADLINE> Eastern Province to Invest Heavily in Ports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, November 30 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province
plans to invest some 12 billion yuan to build ports in the next
eight years, according to local government officials.
</P>
<P>
There are two major port groups in the province, with the
Fuzhou Port and Xiamen Port as their cores.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, Fujian had 99 berths, each able to handle
1,000-ton vessels, including 31 ports, each capable of handling
10,000-ton carriers. The province's total cargo-handling capacity
of local ports is nearly 40 million tons.
</P>
<P>
However, the local government still considers the development
of ports as lagging behind the growth in other transport
infrastructures such as highways and aviation.
</P>
<P>
According to the provincial plan, by the year 2005 Fujian
should increase the number of deep-water docks to 85, each with a
capacity to handle 10,000-ton vessels, with the province's total
port handling ability set at 120-to-130 million tons of goods.
</P>
<P>
A series of policies have been issued by the Fujian Provincial
Government to encourage domestic and foreign investors to
participate in the construction of ports.

<HEADLINE> HK Citizens' Fire Prevention Awareness Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Fire Services
Department (FSD) received 7,651 complaints from local citizens
over fire hazards in the first three quarters of this year, which
represented an increase of 65 percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
The statistics showed an increase in people's awareness of
fire prevention.
</P>
<P>
And 5,709 Fire Hazard Abatement Notices issued by the FSD in
the same period this year showed an increase of 62 percent over
the previous year, said John Tsang, acting director of the
department, at a ceremony to mark the launch of the 1997/98 Fire
Prevention Campaign here today.
</P>
<P>
The campaign this year centers on the theme of fire safety of
commercial buildings.
</P>
<P>
He added that the number of fire calls in the first nine months
this year stood at more than 26,000, and 40 deaths and 442
injuries were recorded. Of the injured, 13 were fire personnel.
</P>
<P>
The tragic fire at the Galley Building in Kowloon a year ago
which caused 39 deaths, had driven home the message that
"prevention is better than cure," Tsang said. The fire at the
16-storey building was believed to be the worst in Hong Kong over
the past century.
</P>
<P>
To maintain the momentum of fire prevention awareness,
publicity pamphlets would be distributed and open days of local
fire stations would be staged, he added.

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriot Pilgrims Visit Monastery in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 Greek
Cypriots today crossed to the Turkish-controlled northern Cyprus
for the biggest pilgrimage at the monastery of Apostolos Andreas,
on the eastern tip of the island.
</P>
<P>
The 1,044 pilgrims on board 23 buses provided by the Turkish
Cypriot authorities, made the 150-kilometer, three-hour trek to
celebrate the feast day of the Saint.
</P>
<P>
It is the second pilgrimage this year to the monastery. More
than 650 Greek Cypriots traveled to Apostolos Andreas on August
15, day of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
A mass will be held at the monastery to celebrate the Saint's
feast day, November 30, in accordance with the Greek Orthodox
calendar.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 other Greek Cypriots, who were not on the list of
people allowed to go on the pilgrimage, also gathered near the
Ledra Palace checkpoint under U.N. peacekeepers' control, the only
place from which one can enter the northern island, anxious to
visit the monastery.
</P>
<P>
But they were told by U.N. soldiers that the buses were full
and that no more people are allowed to visit the monastery for
security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots were also allowed on several occasions to
cross the U.N.-controlled cease-fire line to visit the Turkish
Cypriot enclave of Kokkina, in the northeastern part of the
island, and pay a pilgrimage to Hala Sultan Tekke mosque in
Larnaca.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of visits was agreed upon by Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash during
their meetings in Nicosia earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The East Mediterranean island has been divided since 1974 when
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
People from the two sides have been prohibited to cross
the 180-kilometer-long U.N.-controlled buffer zone which separates
the island into two parts.

Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, in a visit
to the province of Fujian from November 25 to 29, urged people to
stick to the principle of seeking truth from facts and further
emancipate their minds.
</P>
<P>
He told people there that they should explore more boldly and
develop the nation's economy by implementing the policies of the
15th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that Fujian, which is just across the Taiwan Straits
from Taiwan, should increase co-operation with Taiwan to make a
greater contribution to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
While visiting high-technology enterprises and villages, Qiao
also said he hopes the province will use the advantages it has and
do a better job.

<HEADLINE> UK Children Top Drug-taking League in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Children in Britain are taking
more drugs than their counterparts on the Continent and in the
United States, according to figures from one of Europe's leading
addiction research centers.
</P>
<P>
The new figures put the UK at the top of the league of
15-year-olds experimenting with drugs such as cannabis, ecstasy
and amphetamines.
</P>
<P>
It is not known why British children are more likely to dabble
with drugs, but the findings published this month named the UK as
the drugs center of Europe.
</P>
<P>
The study, compiled by the Trimbos Institute in the
Netherlands, shows that cannabis is the favored teenage drug in
the UK, with four out of 10 having tried it. It suggested that
more than two in 10 take it regularly.
</P>
<P>
Significantly, 13 percent of British youngsters have dabbled
with highly addictive amphetamines -- double the figure of any
other European country.
</P>
<P>
Inge Spruit, head of the addiction and substance use department
at the Trimbos Institute, said that one very worrying aspect of
the research was that children across Europe were experimenting
and mixing and matching all sorts of drugs.

<HEADLINE> LPG Taxis Trial Scheme Launched in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Diesel minibuses and then
buses might be converted to Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) if a
trial scheme for 30 taxis powered by LPG proves successful in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of the on-going campaign to tackle the
ever-growing air pollution, which is taken by many as one of the
major problems threatening the health of the 6.3 million Hong Kong
citizens.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has relied heavily on the use of diesel vehicles,
thus rendering a high concentration of respirable suspended
particulates (RSP) beyond the acceptable level," said Bowen Leung,
Secretary for Planning, Environment and Lands.
</P>
<P>
To reduce the level of RSP by tightening the emission standards
for various types of vehicles or improving upon their maintenance
alone would not adequately solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
And studies showed that the higher the RSP concentration, the
higher would be the rate of respiratory infection.
</P>
<P>
Several Hong Kong Government departments have since 1996 been
working with the gas suppliers and the motor trade in studying
their safety requirements.
</P>
<P>
Leung said preliminary assessment has concluded that it is both
safe and technically feasible to use LPG vehicles in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Officials did not rule out scraping the entire 18,000-vehicle
local fleet, with a replacement estimated to cost six billion HK
dollars (0.76 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Secretary for Planning, Environment and Lands
Benjamin Tang Kwok-bun said details of the switch from diesel to
LPG would depend on the success of the trial.

</P>
<P>
Companies attending the exhibition cover such industries as
electronics, aerospace, automobiles, machine building and chemical
industry, food, biological engineering, posts and
telecommunications and commercial services.
</P>
<P>
According to the organizing committee of the expo, enterprises
from Japan, the Republic of Korea (ROK), the United States, Europe

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Prices Remain High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 30 (xinhua) -- Nigerians are enjoying a low
inflation rate but a high price level, according to the Federal
Office of Statistics (FOS).
</P>
<P>
The continued drop in the nation's inflation rate, which head
of state General Sani Abacha claimed to be lower than 10 percent,
has not affected the prices of goods and services across the
country, said FOS Director-General Oladejo Ajayi at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Defining the rate of inflation as "the rate of the change of
prices", Ajayi said that the decrease in inflation rate to less
than 10 percent did not mean that the level of prices of goods
and services had gone down by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the rate at which price level is changing now
and compare this with the past, you will then agree with the
figure quoted by the head of state," he said, quoted by The
Guardian, a local newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
"But that is not to say that price level has come down," he
added.
</P>
<P>
It is widely accepted that the current price level is still
very high in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Due to the poor consumer purchasing power and tight fiscal
measures adopted by the government, the upward movement in prices
is slow, according to observers.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Cuts Air Fares to Buoy up Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has decided to offer a 50
percent reduction on domestic air fares in a bid to support its
backbone tourism industry stricken by the recent massive killings
of foreign tourists in an archeological city in southern Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The decision was adopted Saturday at a meeting attended by
government ministers and the chiefs of tourist and hotel chambers,
local English newspaper the Egyptian Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
The national carrier, EgyptAir, will increase the number of
domestic flights with reduced fares up to 50 percent to Egyptian
and foreigners to encourage domestic tourism, Tourism Minister
Mamdouh el-Beltagui told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also decided that banks should continue with
financing programs for all tourism activities while allowing
deferred payment of instalments owed by tourism and hotel sectors
as well as tourist companies for three months without incurring
extra interests.
</P>
<P>
Various extra fees levied on ships, entry visas, airports,
local hotel and tourist establishments outside the law will be
abolished, according to Beltagui.
</P>
<P>
He also advised private tourist and hotel companies to refrain
from layoffs or speculations and continue with their promotion and
marketing efforts.
</P>
<P>
These supportive measures have been taken in parallel with a
tougher and comprehensive security plan on the heels of the
November 17 massacre in Luxor, about 500 kilometers south of
Cairo, where six gunmen in black police uniforms shot dead 58
foreign tourists and four Egyptians before they were gunned down
by the police.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two weeks, Egypt has introduced waves of major
changes to top security and police posts, as well as a tougher
penalty on abusing police uniforms. It also enlisted the help of
military forces in maintaining security in tourist sites.
</P>
<P>
The attack carried out by Islamic militants threatens to
sabotage Egypt's 3.5 billion-dollar tourism, the mainstay of its
economy. Thousands of tourists have canceled trips after the
Luxor slayings, the worst in Egypt for years.
</P>
<P>
Tourism revenues will decline by at least 2 billion
U.S. dollars, Medhat Hassanein, professor of finance at the
American Unity in Cairo told Al Alam Al Youm, an Egyptian business
daily, last week.
</P>
<P>
About 5-8 million Egyptians directly or indirectly employed in
the tourism sector will surely be hurt by the expected decline in
tourist arrivals.

<HEADLINE> PNG's Coalition on the Verge of Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinea's
five-month-old multi-party coalition government was today on the
brink of falling apart, split by bribery allegations and claims of
backstabbing, the Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Bill Skate arrived back in the country from
Australia and ordered the immediate sacking of Deputy Prime
Minister and Pangu Party leader Chris Haiveta and People's
Progress Party (PPP) leader and Agriculture and Livestock Minister
Andrew Baing.
</P>
<P>
There was a heated exchange between Skate and Haiveta at
Jackson's airport this afternoon when the prime minister told his
deputy, who had arrived to greet him, of his dumping, AAP said.
</P>
<P>
Skate said "... they made me drunk, they made me talk bullshit"
in reference to a secretly-taped video showing Skate claiming to
have ordered an execution.
</P>
<P>
Skate announced to a crowd at the airport that Haiveta was no
longer his deputy.
</P>
<P>
Haiveta said he accepted the decision but that it was an
erratic one because of the pressure Skate was under.
</P>
<P>
Skate accused Haiveta and Baing of orchestrating a campaign to
unseat him by being behind secretly-filmed videotapes showing him
allegedly authorizing bribes to be paid through his internal
affairs minister Thomas Pelika.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) aired the tapes,
filmed by a disgruntled former government adviser Australian
businessman Mujo Sefa last week.
</P>
<P>
A tape screened on Friday night showed Skate boasting that he
had ordered the killing of a Highlands man who shot at him and
claiming he was the godfather of Port Moresby's street gangs.
</P>
<P>
Skate defended the godfather tape saying his comments were made
under the influence of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
Baing tonight welcomed his sacking and denied any knowledge of
plans to set up Skate.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy, I don't want to be part of any criminal
government," said Baing.
</P>
<P>
"I got sacked for upholding the Constitution and the rule of
law in this country. As far as I'm concerned, we did the right
thing."
</P>
<P>
Baing said PPP, which united behind him, was firmly behind
upholding the country's laws.
</P>
<P>
He said Pangu and PPP had no choice about staying in the
coalition and added that Skate had made "his biggest political
blunder".
</P>
<P>
If Pangu and PPP withdrew all of their members it would
effectively make Skate's remaining coalition of the People's
National Congress (PNC), the People's Democratic Movement (PDM)
and a group of independents a lame duck government.
</P>
<P>
Skate said he would contact all Pangu and PPP members tomorrow
and asked them to remain in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed for opposition members to join him.
</P>
<P>
However, Opposition Leader Bernard Narokobi has already called
on Skate to resign and for an inquiry into the allegations.

<HEADLINE> Large-Scale Strike Launched in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 30 (Xinhua) -- An open-ended strike
organized by Israeli Trade Union started early this morning in
protest against government plans for pension reform and
privatization.
</P>
<P>
Local media estimated some 150,000 clerical workers took part
in the strike, which paralyzed operations in 360 local authorities
and national institutions, such as the Jewish Agency and the
Jewish National Fund, and also affected the Fire and Rescue
Service and government companies.
</P>
<P>
The strike will spread to administrative workers of
universities and hospitals Monday, strike organizers said. And
some engineers and social workers will also join the strike.
</P>
<P>
The strike is the latest round in a Trade Union battle against
government economic reform plans, which have sparked fears that
the rights of the workers would be harmed.
</P>
<P>
The Union of Local Authorities of Israel (ULAI) has presented a
petition against the strike to the National Labor Court.
</P>
<P>
ULAI Chairman Adi Eldar expressed the hope that the dispute
should be solved through dialog in stead of harming public
services.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Continues Discussion on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli cabinet started
this morning another round of discussions on the second-stage
Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank as proposed by Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Government sources said that today's cabinet meeting is
expected to appoint a special committee to work out details of the
proposed further troop redeployment in the West Bank, rather than
determine the precise geographical dimensions outlined in
Netanyahu's package deal.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's package deal, as he further explained Thursday,
entails retention, after the final-status talks, of the Jordan
Valley as a buffer against military attack from the east,
continued Israeli control over Jerusalem's enlarged municipal
boundaries and inclusion of the Etzion Bloc of settlements
within Israel's borders.
</P>
<P>
It also stipulates that a security zone must be demarcated
beyond the 1967 Green Line in the West Bank, Israel's control of
the coastline of Gaza strip and no Palestinian statehood in the
future.
</P>
<P>
This is the territorial formula Netanyahu intents to offer to
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) in the final-status talks
that he believes should start immediately and replace the
interim stage of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's proposal has faced strong opposition from several
cabinet ministers such as Justice Minister Tzahi Hanegbi and
Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan, and the National Religious
Party's ministers. The local right-wing groups are also against
it.
</P>
<P>
Facing opposition from the coalition and right-wing groups,
Netanyahu tries to stop short of specifying what percentage of
the West Bank should be handed over to the PNA. Instead, he
prefers to outline the future map of Israel and the PNA as the
Israelis would like to see it.
</P>
<P>
But, Netanyahu's new package deal receives full support from
his key cabinet members such as Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai and Intrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai stated in Haifa on Saturday that the government
should give full support to Netanyahu's proposal because Israel
can not skip the second-stage troop redeployment and Israel must
honor its commitments and help move the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet endorsement of Netanyahu's package deal, including the
second-stage troops withdrawal in the West Bank, appears certain,
but to resolve the differences over this issue among cabinet
members and the right-ring groups remains very difficult,
observers said.

<HEADLINE> PNG PM Sacks Two Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinea (PNG) Prime
Minister Bill Skate today ordered the immediate sacking of two
leaders of his ruling coalition, accusing them of orchestrating
bribery allegations against him and a senior minister, the
Australia Associated Press (AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
Skate, who arrived in PNG this afternoon from Australia, said
he had issued instructions for the dismissal of Pangu Party leader
Chris Haveta and People Progress Party (PPP) leader Andrew Baing,
the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Haveta was deputy prime minister and minister in charge of
planning and implementation, and Baing was minister in charge of
agriculture and livestock.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for Skate is not available for the confirmation
of the news.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister issued writs in the Queensland Supreme Court
on November 27 in Brisbane, Australia, suing the Australian
Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and former government adviser Mujo
Sefa for defamation over an ABC television report last week
alleging Skate authorized 1,300 US dollars in bribes through his
Internal Affairs Minister Thomas Pelika.
</P>
<P>
The ABC said its report was based on tapes secretly filmed by
Sefa in his office.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was later under pressure from opposition
parties to resign over the corruption allegation.
</P>
<P>
Skate accused the two sacked ministers of organizing the
bribery allegations to cover up previous and current corruption
allegations against the former Pangu-PPP ruling administration,
AAP said.

<HEADLINE> GCC Drafts Law to Attract Foreign Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) states have drafted a joint law to attract foreign
capital to diversify their oil-reliant economies, local newspaper
Gulf News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The law, which includes new incentives and easing curbs on
foreign investors, will be presented for approval by the GCC heads
of state when they hold their annual summit in Kuwait on December
20.
</P>
<P>
The law calls for the creation of a foreign investment
committee in each member state to attract capital and coordinate
investment policies.
</P>
<P>
The GCC states, namely, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates
(UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and Kuwait, need industrial technology
to ease reliance on oil earnings which account for nearly two
thirds of their total incomes every year.
</P>
<P>
The development of non-oil industry in the GCC states has been
limited by current investment policies, under which foreign
investors in the GCC states are not permitted to own more than 49
percent of any project.
</P>
<P>
The rule has been criticized by the industrial countries. The
United States and the European Union states have repeatedly urged
the GCC to lift restrictions to encourage foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
Gulf News said the new investment law made some changes on the
restrictions by allowing free profit and capital transfer for
foreign investors and exempting them from customs tariffs on
several imported products as well as from income taxes for five
years.

<P>
ABU DHABI, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Bahrain is to seek the
extradition of eight opposition leaders in exile who have been
sentenced imprisonment between five and 15 years for trying to
topple the government, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain's security authorities are preparing extradition files
which would be presented through diplomatic channels or the
Interpol, Gulf News said, adding at least five of those are
believed living in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The eight men fled abroad after a foiled coup in June last year
to overthrow the ruling Al Khalifa family, which has dominated the
tiny island Gulf country for more than 200 years.
</P>
<P>
Gulf News said they were ruled guilty in absentia on November
22 in a secret trial without defenders. Under Bahrain's laws, they
will be retried if they appear in court voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
Among the eight people, six were also ordered to pay a total of
15 million U.S. dollars for damaging public property, said the

<HEADLINE> Border Province Battling Against AIDS Epidemic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- A total of 4,678 AIDS cases
makes the border province of Yunnan China's major battlefield
against acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), according to
the provincial Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
About 56 percent of the country's total AIDS cases are in
Yunnan Province, said a report released by the department, adding
that 15 of its 17 prefectures have reported AIDS cases since the
first was discovered in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Provincial officials blame the AIDS epidemic on drug
trafficking in areas bordering Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar and drug
abuse among local residents.
</P>
<P>
Of the reported cases, 91 percent were caused by contaminated
syringes used to inject drugs, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The health department has called for a battle against the
disease, which has no vaccine or cure so far.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan has set up an AIDS research center and a surveillance
network of 41 stations targeting drug abusers, prostitutes,
sexually transmitted disease patients and pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
The province is constructing AIDS prevention and control
facilities at six prefectures, 26 counties and eight ports. The
project, scheduled to be finished by 2000, will cost 50 million
yuan (6 million U.S. dollars) provided by local government and
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
So far, the province has received about 14 million yuan in
special anti-AIDS funds from the United Nations Development
Program, UNAIDS, the European Union and other international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan officials also have conducted a massive publicity
campaign among local residents.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent of the ordinary people have known the
basics about AIDS compared with less than 20 percent previously,
after a health education project was launched among the people in
11 cities and counties, according to Yang Chaobin, deputy director
of the health department.

DAR ES SALAAM, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The landing and taking
off of aircraft during the night at Zanzibar airport has become a
dangerous activity because of shortage of electricity.
</P>

The whole airport is lost in darkness at night, except for

The Zanzibar isles, 21 miles off the coast of the Tanzanian
mainland, need a total of 18 megawatts of electricity but are

the drought forced a major hydro-electricity station of the
country to shut down in late October.
</P>
<P>
In a recent trip to the airport, Zanzibar President Dr Salmin
Amour himself experienced the dim light and danger nervously,
embarrassing the airport management officials who later promised
to improve services.
</P>
<P>
An official of the airport said there were about 10 petromax
lamps but they have been taken by some officials to their
families for personal use, leaving the compound in such a
pathetic situation.
</P>
<P>
A worker at the airport said that there is a generator that
can supply electricity for the whole airport area but has been
out of order for a long time and no efforts have been made to
repair it.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Zimbabwe Takes Steps to Stabilize Currency (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Since the Zimbabwean Dollar
nosedived to an all-time low two weeks ago, the southern African
country has taken a series of measures to support the weak
dollar, calming the foreign exchange market and relaxing the
currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
On November 14, the Zimbabwe foreign exchange market was
plummeted to a record low due to panic importer demand of the
U.S. Dollar, trading between 19 and 25 Zimbabwean Dollars to the
U.S. Dollar compared with November 13's closing of 14.25
Zimbabwean Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Local economists attributed the steep fall of the Zimbabwean
Dollar to the fact that currency traders had seen huge importer
demand because the central bank, short on reserves, find it hard
to intervene the market, which leads to panic importation.
</P>
<P>
Rumors had it that Zimbabwe's foreign currency had fallen to
below two month's worth of imports at that time.
</P>
<P>
In the crucial talks between the World Bank and the Zimbabwean
government on November 14, there was little progress with regards
to payments support from the bank of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Financial Minister Herbert Murerwa recognized
exports of gold and tobacco were not performing well and the
balance of payment position was deteriorating, thus waning
investor's confidence about the future of the economy.
</P>
<P>
In face of the serious financial situation, the Zimbabwean
government took three measures to stabilize the foreign exchange
market.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the reserve bank pumped in 20 million U.S. Dollars to
support the Zimbabwean Dollar.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the central bank increased the re-discount rate from
25.5 percent to 28.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the bank also directed that all corporate foreign
currency account balances be off-loaded onto the foreign exchange
market.
</P>
<P>
Now, all these measures have enabled the Zimbabwean Dollar to
recover and trade at between 14 and 15 dollars to the U.S.
Dollar.

<HEADLINE> Shanxi Province's Telecommunications Industry Booming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The telecommunications
industry in central China's Shanxi Province has made
headway. Turnover topped 1.7 billion yuan in the first half of the
year, up 63 percent on a yearly basis, to rank third in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago the industry was considered a bottleneck for
economic growth in this landlocked province. The rate of
telephones was 1.7 in every 100 and the industry had an annual
turnover of 200 million yuan (24,096 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The present achievement should be attributed to the provincial
government's effort to channel 5.8 billion yuan of funds to
upgrade the infrastructure during the last five years.
</P>
<P>
Funds for the telecommunications once accounted for only
two-thirds of the introduced investment in Shanxi.
</P>
<P>
Efforts began to pay off last year, since the
telecommunications sector not only repaid loans but also earned
200 million yuan in profit. The number of telephone subscribers
increased from 180,000 in 1992 to one million in 1996, 70 percent
of which are private applicants.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the length of optical fiber cable and digital
micro-wave cable accounts for 4,225 kilometers. All counties in
the province now have access to long-distance digital
communications.
</P>
<P>
The latest focus of Shanxi's telecommunications sector is
diversifying services.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Zimbabwe Takes Steps to Stabilize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were mixed reactions from local money market analysts on
moves taken by the government to support the weak Zimbabwean
Dollar.
</P>
<P>
They said, "the measures may not be sufficient since there is
still a high import demand before the Christmas Day. However,
they will help narrow the gap between the dollar and other major
currencies."
</P>
<P>
The economic commentators held that the hike of the rediscount
rate, the rate at which banks borrow money from the central bank,
did not solve fundamental macro-economic problems and was only a
stop-gap measure.
</P>
<P>
They warned that the move by the Reserve Bank to increase the
rediscount rate in a bid to reverse the recent slide in the
Zimbabwean Dollar would throw off track efforts to achieve
macro-economic stability.
</P>
<P>
Chief economist of Zimbabwe's National Chamber of Commerce
John Makamure stressed while in the short-term the central bank's
move would help arrest the current slide of the local currency,
in the long run the problem might recur.
</P>
<P>
"For as long as the budget deficit and inflation remain high,
the problems of depreciation of the currency will continue to
haunt the economy," said President of the Confederation of
Zimbabwean Industries Jonee Blanchfield.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa said he had to act urgently
to avert a "disaster". The government had been aware of the
negative developments which were leading to the depreciation of
the Zimbabwean Dollar.
</P>
<P>
But, the multilateral financial institutions recently had
agreed to fund the Zimbabwe's second economic reform program. The
agreements, if reached, would improve Zimbabwe's balance of
payments position and in turn help stabilize the currency, the
minister said.

NEW DELHI, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Foreign secretaries of India
and Pakistan are likely to meet either in New Delhi or Islamabad
next month to carry forward bilateral dialogue to resolve all
outstanding issues between the two countries, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was broadly decided during informal consultations between
Indian Minister of State for External Affairs Saleem Shervani and
his Pakistani counterpart Mohammed Siddique Kunju at Bandos
islands in Maldives where a meeting of foreign ministers of the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) began on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, despite the political turmoil in
the countries, talks between the two ministers went off very well.
</P>
<P>
The ministers reaffirmed their commitment to improve bilateral
relations within the SAARC framework and stressed the need to
develop cooperative relations and make progress on all issues
including developing people-to-people contact.
</P>
<P>
As to the foreign secretary-level talks resumed in March last
after a three-year freeze, both sides felt that the structured
dialogue between the foreign secretaries should not be allowed to
get bogged down by procedural difficulties, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Since the resumption of talks in March last, foreign
secretaries of India and Pakistan have met three times. But the
talks have come to a deadlock over differences on whether a
working group on the Kashmir issue should be set up or not after
their third round of talks in New Delhi in September.

<HEADLINE> Canada Visit Successful, Says Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TORONTO, Canada, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said here today that his state visit to Canada is
successful and served the purpose of deepening understanding,
enhancing friendship and developing cooperation with eyes set on
the future.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks in an interview with The Globe and Mail,
a Toronto-based newspaper, before winding up his visit here and
leaving for Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he and Canadian Governor-General Romeo LeBlanc,
Prime Minister Jean Chretien and other Canadian leaders had
fruitful talks Friday.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, they had an in-depth exchange of views and
reached broad common ground on bilateral relations and some major
regional and international issues of mutual interest, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
China and Canada inked a number of bilateral agreements and a
host of economic contracts or letters of intent worth nearly 2
billion U.S. dollars during the visit.
</P>
<P>
"At the historical juncture of the turn of the century,
Canadian leaders and I all maintain that we should establish a
cross-century partnership of overall cooperation between our two
countries," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the two countries forged diplomatic ties in
1970, bilateral ties have maintained a good momentum of
development. The exchange of visits by their leaders has been
increasing, their economic and trade ties have been expanding fast
with the two-way trade volume growing steadily, and their exchanges
and cooperation in the fields of science and technology, culture,
education, sports and health have been strengthened. The two
countries also have had good cooperation on some major regional
and international issues.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he believes that as long as both sides set their
eyes on the future and follow the principles of mutual respect and
benefit, China-Canada relations will record a long term and stable
development.
</P>
<P>
On the biggest question China now faces, Jiang said it is to
make China's 1.23 billion people live in peace and contentment
with their life being improved continuously.
</P>
<P>
China has only 7 percent of the world's arable land, but its
population accounts for 22 percent of the world's total.
Developing agriculture to feed and cloth 1.2 billion people is
the top priority for the Chinese leadership.
</P>
<P>
On the recent financial turbulence in Southeast Asia, Jiang
said it did not have much impact on China and its Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region. He said Hong Kong has maintained
its economic prosperity, social stability and bright prospects for
the future. China's overall economic situation is also bright,
Jiang added.

<HEADLINE> Cuba, U.S. to Negotiate on Migration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Cuba and the United States will
hold a new round of migratory negotiations here starting from
December 2 to examine the implementation of the migratory
agreements signed between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the Cuban Foreign Affairs Ministry, President of
the National Assembly of People's Power Ricardo Alarcon will head
a delegation for the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The previous seventh round of negotiations was held in July
1997 in New York, which, both sides agree, provided a constructive
context for the discussion of all pending questions.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral dialogues were conducted in a complex
circumstance caused by the acquittal of the hijackers of a tourism
Cuban airliner in 1996 by the court of Tampa, a U.S. city.
</P>
<P>
On that occasion, both sides also discussed the removal of
obstacles raised by the Havana-based U.S. Office of interests to
the requests for visas by those who wanted to pay a short visit to
their relatives in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The 1994 and 1995 migratory agreements require the U.S. to
return illegal immigrants intercepted in the high seas and those
that enter the U.S. Guantanamo Naval Base.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate an orderly and legal migratory flow, Washington
is also required to grant at least 20,000 visas a year to Cuban
applicants for emigration to the United States.

<HEADLINE> China Acts to Clean up Accounting Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- A number of small accounting
firms are expected to shut down before the end of next year in a
nationwide clean-up of the public accounting industry, according
to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Industrial insiders said an inspection launched in August is
aimed at checking the qualifications of accountants, their
professional ethics, plus the capital and operations of accounting
firms.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, all Certified Public Accountant (CPA) firms,
including the Chinese partners of Sino-foreign accounting joint
ventures are required to break their links with their launchers,
most of them government departments and institutions.
</P>
<P>
One accounting firm in Zhejiang Province has been ordered to
close after the Ministry of Finance found the firm had not met its
registered capital requirements and was stricken by poor
management.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is also punishing three other accounting firms
for breaking the law and using unfair practices to make big
profits.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the examination was launched amid heightening
concern over quality and professional ethics in the industry after
several cases involving fake reporting were disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Services' Greater Role In Generating Italy's Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Italian services provided by
business, hotels, retailers, credit institutions and insurers and
in the areas of transport and communications are playing an
increasingly great role in generating the wealth of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Italy's National Statistics Institute reported today that
services now provide more than half the value added to production.
</P>
<P>
Value added in 1992 came to about 48.1 percent and reached 53.4
percent in 1996 while the entire tertiary sector became the
nation's largest employer with nearly 10 million Italians on these
payrolls to account for 44.7 percent of the total workforce.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the nation's wealth generated by agriculture shrank
from 4.5 to 3.5 percent and industry declined from 31.3 to 29.2
percent, said the institute.

<HEADLINE> Tardy Regions Need Stimulus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- A senior economic researcher
has proposed the establishment of three cross-border special
economic zones to ginger up China's central and western regions,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Di Kui highlighted three transnational corridors running
through zones on the Sino-Russian, Sino-Myanmar and
Sino-Kazakhstan borders: the bridge being constructed between
Russia and China's Northwestern Heihe city; the road connecting
southwest China's Yunnan Province with Myanmar, leading finally to
the Indian Ocean; and the new Euro-Asia Continental Bridge running
from east China's Lianyungang and Rizhao ports through the vast
central and western provinces all the way to Rotterdam in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Di suggested that these three transportation corridors, if
effectively used, could propel the economy of the landlocked
middle and western regions.
</P>
<P>
Di noticed that due to their small scattered and unorganized
nature, the existing cross-border co-operation is too weak to
spark the macro-economy of the central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
Di also proposed that "border processing zones" that could make
full use of the abundant raw materials and labor force in these
remote areas of China.
</P>
<P>
Among the three trans-border free economic zones he proposed,
Di said that the one bordering Myanmar is the most mature and the
easiest to develop and the zone in northeastern China is
"evolving" with China and Russia starting negotiations in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Di predicted that the northwestern zone on the China-Kazakhstan
border will tap the tremendous potential that the new Euro-Asia
Continental Bridge contains to boost the economic development of
both this region and the whole central and western area.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Russian Commerce Set to Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Sino-Russian trade will
continue to grow despite fluctuations in recent years, today's
China Daily quoted a senior trade official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The growth momentum is unlikely to reverse," said Hu Chusheng,
director general of the European Affairs Department of the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec).
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese customs, trade between China and Russia
has hovered around six to seven billion US dollars in recent
years, with China having a big deficit.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and Russian leaders have decided to push bilateral
trade to 20 billion US dollars by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The leaders were proceeding from the need to develop
State-to-State relations and bilateral economic co-operation, as
well as economic potential," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed breakthroughs must be made in four areas if the
20 billion US dollars target is to be realized.
</P>
<P>
First, the two countries should diversify their forms of trade
and economic co-operation, increasing the trade of higher
value-added products. At present, commodity trade is the mainstay
of bilateral economic ties.
</P>
<P>
Second, the two sides should improve collaboration in trading
infrastructure and service sectors, such as banking, insurance,
and arbitration.
</P>
<P>
Third, the two countries should promote bilateral co-operation
in large and long-term projects, so as to provide a new growth
factor and a stable basis for bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
Lastly, as both countries are moving towards a market economy,
their enterprises should pay more attention to business credit,
product quality, commercial conditions, financial capacity, and
post-sales service.

<HEADLINE> More Opening Vital for Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese senior economist
recently stressed the urgency of China's foreign trade reform,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Whether China's economic growth continues to be spurred by
foreign trade depends on how the country's trade regime will be
reshaped, said Yang Shengming, director of the Institute of
Finance and Trade Economics under the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the foreign trade agency model as "a dose of
medicine" that "treats only the symptoms, instead of the root
cause of the disease."
</P>
<P>
The agency mechanism should be applied only to those
medium-sized and small enterprises that are not able to enter the
world market by themselves, said Yang.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang, the foreign-invested companies and
enterprises with foreign-trade rights, which are increasing in
number and market share, have provided a shot in the arm to
China's foreign trade development.
</P>
<P>
Yang also stressed the opening-up of China's foreign trade,
saying "no opening, no development."
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from Chinese customs, during the first
ten months of this year, enterprises involving foreign investment
raked in 59.72 billion U.S.dollars from exports, up 22.4 percent
from the same period last year, and their imports registered a
seven percent rise.
</P>
<P>
"All this indicates that the gate into China's foreign trade
field has opened rather wide," said Yang.

<HEADLINE> Romania Protects Children from AIDS Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Romania has effectively
protected children from the danger of being cross-infected by the
HIV virus, Romanian Secretary of State of the Ministry of Public
Health Molnar Geza said here today.
</P>
<P>
Only five cases of child-infection by the HIV have been found
so far this year, none of them resulted from injection or blood
transfusion.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are more than 4,000 child HIV-carriers in
Romania, topping all the other European countries. Most of the
children were infected at the end of the 1980s through blood
transfusion or injection.
</P>
<P>
To avoid cross infection on the part of children, the Romanian
health departments began to press forward the use of disposable
syringes in 1990 and keep tight control on the quality of blood
products.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the government has also intensified AIDS
awareness campaign throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Health stations have been set up to provide necessary health
care to homeless children.
</P>
<P>
Geza said sexual contact and maternal infection will remain to
be the main channels for AIDS spreading in the country.
</P>
<P>
Romania found its first case of HIV infection in 1985 and now
has a total of about 470 adult HIV-carriers, the Romanian news
agency reported.

anti-personnel landmines.
</P>
<P>
He said, the Chinese government has always attached great
importance to humanitarian concerns over anti-personnel landmines
(APLs) and supported proper and reasonable restrictions on
landmines, especially APLs.
</P>
<P>
As one of the earliest States Parties to the Conventional on
Prohibition or Restriction on the Use of Certain Conventional
Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have
Indiscriminate Effects (CCW), China has always strictly abided by
the provisions of Protocol II (Landmine Protocol) of the CCW and
other relevant instruments and made positive contributions to the
amendment of the Landmine Protocol and the further enhancement of
restrictive measures on landmines, he said.
</P>
<P>
In April 1996, the Chinese government made a serious
announcement that China would not export APLs that failed to meet
the technical specifications of the amended Protocol even before
its formal entry into force. Currently, China is giving a positive
consideration to the early ratification of the new Landmine
Protocol, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is in favor of humanitarian efforts of
the international community aimed at preventing the casualties of
innocent civilians by the indiscriminate use of APLs. Over the
years, it has conducted fruitful work in both mine sweeping
operations inside the country and international assistance of mine
clearance, he said.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to actively join international efforts at
mine clearance, including making contributions to the
international fund on mine clearance. We are also ready to assist
countries suffering from landmine problems in the areas of mine
clearance-related training, technology and equipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are of the view that the general principle of solving the
landmine problem should be one that takes balanced account of both
humanitarian concerns and the legitimate military needs of
sovereign states for self-defense," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The issue of security is in itself a humanitarian
concern. Countries differ in their national conditions and defense
needs. For many countries, especially those lacking advanced
defensive weapons, APLs remain an effective means of self-defense,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has consistently adhered to an
independent foreign policy of peace. The sole purpose of its using
APLs within its territory is to safeguard national unity and
territorial integrity and ensure the peaceful life of the Chinese
people. Before an alternative of APLs is found, China must reserve
the right to use APLs on its own soil so as to form defensive
capability, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman declared: "We have noted that some countries have
concluded Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,
Production, and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their
Destruction. Based on the above-mentioned position, China does not
intend to sign this convention.
</P>
<P>
"However, we respect the sovereign choice made by these
countries and understand their humanitarian desires and concerns.
The Chinese government will send an observer delegation to the
signing conference of the Convention to be held in Ottawa, Canada,
on December 3, 1997 and the parallel roundtable on international
mine clearance and assistance."

<HEADLINE> Monetary Crisis Takes Its Toll on Indonesian Textile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The recent monetary crisis has
taken its toll on the Indonesian textile industry, putting scores
of medium-sized textile firms out of business, an industry
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Benny Soetrisno, secretary general of the Indonesian Textile
Association (API), said in Yogyakarta, Central Java, on Saturday
that prices of raw materials for the textile industry had
increased by 12 percent to 25 percent, preventing many firms from
attaining maximum production.
</P>
<P>
API had advised its members to cut their production by 20 to 30
percent in view of the situation, reports reaching here today
quoted Benny as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said API had also urged the collapsed companies to cooperate
with others which were still healthy.
</P>
<P>
API has a total membership of 5,000 textile companies including
550 big and 2,000 medium-sized companies.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's exports of textile products reached 6.42 billion US
dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The country has set a target of exporting textile products
worth 7.8 billion dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, along with other Southeast Asian countries, has been
hit badly by the monetary crisis since early July. The value of
the Indonesian rupiah has dropped by more than 40 percent against
the US dollar this year.

<HEADLINE> Experts: Foreign Trade to Grow Steadily in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign trade in 1998
is expected to rise to 370 billion US. dollars, experts said.
</P>
<P>
A better balance between imports and exports, along with a
declined trade surplus, is expected next year as a result of
constant and stable development in the Chinese domestic market and
the encouraging progress in world's economy, economists said.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a market system and economic restructuring
will bring another cycle of growth to China and provide a
systematic environment and material basis for trade development,
said Li Yushi, a professor from the International Trade and
Economic Cooperation Research Institute under the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li said the nation's successful soft landing of the economy in
recent years has effectively controlled inflation and has kept
prices stable. As a result, foreign trade prices are relatively
cheap, he said, and lower interest rates on loans and steady
exchange rates for RMB are favorable to bringing down trade costs
and increasing imports.
</P>
<P>
China's import-export businesses have focused on economic
returns after years of reforms, he said. Meanwhile, the release of
trade rights has allowed a great number of enterprises to engage
in imports and exports independently, Li said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, one unfavorable situation in domestic
enterprises is increased liability which could hold back export
growth.
</P>
<P>
The enlarged international market capacity is beneficial to
China's export businesses, he said, but the financial crisis in
Southeast Asia has caused a massive devaluation in the region
which will have a negative impact on China's exports.
</P>
<P>
Li Jian, deputy director of China's Foreign Trade Office of the
International Trade Research Institution, said the extensive
lowering of tariffs in October would further increase import
growth and reduce the trade surplus.
</P>
<P>
He said imports would be a strong stimulus for domestic
industries to deepen their reform, speed up technological
advancement and upgrade management. The decline of import costs
would also improve investment climate to attract more technology,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Yushi said the need for imports would also be strengthened
with the appearance of a new cycle of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
China's total volumes of foreign trade increased from 20.6
billion U.S. dollars in 1978 to 289 billion dollars in 1996,
climbing from the 32nd place to number 11 in the world.

<HEADLINE> Increased Quota Would Not Lower Oil Price: OPEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Dr. Rilwanu
Lukman believed that OPEC's decision to raise the organization's
oil output quota for the first semester of 1998 to 27.5 million
barrels per day (bpd) would not lower the oil price on the world
market.
</P>
<P>
"The aim of our increasing the production quota is not to lower
the oil price, but we believe it would stabilize the price,"
Rilwanu said here late last night after reading out the results of
the fourth day's session of the 103rd OPEC ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ministers of the 11 members of the oil cartel eventually agreed
on an increase in the production quota last night following
intensive deliberations since Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Rilwanu, who was re-elected as secretary general Saturday for
the 1997-2000 term, believed the price of oil on the world market
would not drop following OPEC's decision to increase its
production quota from the current 25.033 million bpd to 27.5
million bpd for the first semester of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the growth in world demand for oil next year,
Rilwanu estimated the increase would range from 1.5 to 2 million
bpd.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said with regard to oil consumption, it would
make no difference for the world whether oil is produced by OPEC
or non-OPEC countries.
</P>
<P>
Oil and energy ministers from the 11 OPEC member countries --
Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Nigeria and Venezuela --
attended the six-day meeting which started on November 26. The
meeting will conclude on December 1.

<HEADLINE> Pak PM Accuses President of Taking Partial Stand in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif today accused President Farooq Leghari of taking
sides with the judiciary in the ongoing constitutional crisis
involving the country's executive and the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot accept that taking sides by the Presidency in
delicate and sensitive matters is in the national interest, or
will help towards the attainment of a just solution, which is what
the paramount national interest requires," Sharif said in his
reply letter to the president, who sent Sharif a letter earlier
today.
</P>
<P>
"It grieves me to point out that these actions on your part
cannot, in any manner whatsoever, enhance the status and dignity
of the Presidency", Sharif said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Rightists Protest Against Further Troop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 29 (Xinhua) -- About 300 Israeli rightists
held demonstration tonight outside the prime minister's
residence protesting against U.S. pressure and government plan to
further withdraw troops from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
With huge banners of "No Concessions," "No Surrender to U.S.
Pressure," the protesters demanded Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu reject the pressure from the United States, and not
carry out the second stage of troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The rally was organized by rightwing groups, including the
Ideological Front, Council of Jewish Settlements and Israel's
Right. It was the first of its kind since Netanyahu came to power
last year.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, accusing Netanyahu of lying to his supporters,
requested he stop immediately handing over land to the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
They also attacked U.S. President Bill Clinton for pressurizing
Netanyahu to make concessions to the PNA for "the U.S. own
interests."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet has failed to reach an agreement on the
proposed troop pullbacks from 6-8 percent of the West Bank. It is
scheduled to discuss the issue Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The tune of the demonstration was kept low-key compared to the
hysteric protests organized by the same groups against the
previous Labor government.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said the demonstration was not aimed at opposing
Netanyahu but the further troop redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Fears about renewed violence against political leaders
resurfaced recently after posters of Netanyahu in Arab headdress
were pasted throughout Jerusalem last Thursday by the Ideological
Front in protest against further redeployment.
</P>
<P>
This was reminiscent of the similar posters featuring former
Labor prime minister Yitzhak Rabin in the same Arab headdress,
which were widely displayed months before his assassination in
November 1995.
