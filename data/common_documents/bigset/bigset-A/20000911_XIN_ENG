<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Ruling Party Difficult to Return to Power: Study Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 10 (Xinhua) --Return to power by the ruling
Awami League (AL) in the next general election might be difficult
if the party fails to resolve the current internal feud in the
grassroots level and choose candidates in some cases carefully,
leaders of a fact-finding team of AL predicted.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had assigned former leaders of AL'
s student wing Bangladesh Chattra League (BCL) for fact-finding to
prepare a secret report on the party's position in all the 300
seats of the parliament, with the view to having a clear picture
on the prospects of her party in the next general election.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hasina wants to know her party position in the
grassroots level beforehand to fix correct strategy to win the
next election.
</P>
<P>
The leaders on completion of their fact-finding tour are now
preparing the report and will submit it to the prime minister and
AL Chief Sheikh Hasina soon. The student leaders in 18 groups
visited all the 64 districts for doing their job.
</P>
<P>
Some of the student leaders told Xinhua that unless AL settles
the infighting of the party leaders in the grassroots level and
drops some candidates, the party might lose 25 seats in the next
election. In some cases brawl was so serious that leaders of a
single chapter do not sit together.
</P>
<P>
They said that some of the cabinet members and a few sitting
lawmakers of the ruling party have made their position risky in
their constituencies for the next election through their actions.
</P>
<P>
The party will have to change candidates in these cases, the
student leaders said, declining to name the ministers and the
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The leaders observed that the popularity of Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina went up in four years, but this would not be so much
helpful in winning the election unless the party resolves the
internal wrangles and choose candidates carefully.
</P>
<P>
They suggested that keeping the success and failure of the
government now aside, the party should immediately give attention
to settling the internal quarrels among the leaders in the
grassroots level.
</P>
<P>
Hasina took the decision a day after she met her cabinet
colleagues at a meeting in the capital where she said the next
election will be held some time in October next year and her
government will stay in power till July 13.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hasina took the decision to know the position of her
party in the backdrop of opposition's decision to form electoral
alliance in the next general election.

<HEADLINE> Visiting British Minister Stresses Free and Fair Election in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Free and fair election is a
must for continuity of democracy, visiting British Home Minister
Jack Straw said here Sunday, suggesting guarantee of a pre-
election environment wherein all sides can debate freely.
</P>
<P>
Democracy is the "only future" for Bangladesh, he told
reporters at a press briefing after ending his 24-hour visit to
Dhaka during which he met with opposition leader Begum Zia and
held official talks with his Bangladesh counterpart Home Minister
Mohammad Nasim.
</P>
<P>
"Economic situation of a country depends on how strengthened
are the democratic institutions and these two go hand in hand," he
told the newsmen at the press briefing.
</P>
<P>
His observations stemmed from his first-hand view of Bangladesh
's political scenario marked by strikes and hartals (destructive
strikes) amid opposition movement for resignation of the
government and immediate elections.
</P>
<P>
When referring to the immigrant issue, Straw said the British
government would do whatever possible to smoothen the visa
procedures at the Dhaka immigration office, which is one of the
busiest centers in the country, receiving a large number of
applications, of which 75 percent are approved.
</P>
<P>
At present there are 300,000 Britons of Bangladeshi origin, he
informed.
</P>
<P>
Issues like criminality, corruption, human rights and also
commercial relations were discussed during the official talks
between the two home ministers, Straw said.
</P>
<P>
As a prominent member of Tony Blair's cabinet and the topmost
representative of the current British government to visit
Bangladesh, Straw arrived in Dhaka Saturday evening and held
official talks Sunday with his Bangladeshi counterpart, Mohammad
Nasim. He also called on leader of the Opposition Begum Khaleda
Zia and Chief Justice Latifur Rahman.

<HEADLINE> Italian GP: Schumacher Wins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Ferrari's Michael Schumacher won
the Italian Grand Prix in Monza on Sunday, moving to within two
points of his arch-rival, McLaren's Mika Hakkinen, at the top of
the championship standings.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher led all the way in a race marred by a violent crash
at the start, which left Ferrari team-mate Rubens Barrichello,
McLaren's David Coulthard and four other drivers out at the first
chicane.
</P>
<P>
After ten laps run behind the safety car, Schumacher's Ferrari
steadily pulled away from Hakkinen's McLaren, which appeared to
lack the advantage of speed it had in Belgium two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen finished second and Ralf Schumacher, Michael's brother,
took the third spot in a Williams.
</P>
<P>
It was Schumacher's third victory at Monza and Ferrari's
seventh this season, a record not achieved by the team since 1953.
</P>
<P>
The German, who has now equalled Brazilian Ayrton Senna's
record of 41 career victories, was so overcome that at the press
conference after the race he broke down in tears and was unable to
continue.
</P>
<P>
The victory was an important boost for team morale which had
suffered after a series of disappointing results culminating in
Hakkinen's overtaking of Schumacher in the last laps of the
Belgian Grand prix two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The Finn now leads the championship standings with 80 points to
Schumacher's 78. In the constructors standings McLaren leads
Ferrari by 131 points to 127.
</P>
<P>
With three races to go, the stage is set for a dramatic finish
to the Formula 1 season.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Mubarak Discuss Palestinian-Israeli Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
on Monday discussed with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak the
latest developments of the peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat paid a brief visit to Egypt in the day, during which he
held talks with Mubarak at Burg al Arab airport, to the west of the
Mediterranean port city of Alexandria. The meeting came one day
after the Palestinian Central Council (PCC) decided to delay
declaration of statehood.
</P>
<P>
Arafat briefed Mubarak on his meeting with U.S. President Bill
Clinton last Wednesday in New York and some ideas raised during the
meeting which were not accepted by Israel, Egyptian Information
Minister Safwat el-Sharif said after the talks.
</P>
<P>
El-Sharif did not specify the ideas. But reports have said that
Arafat has proposed "Islamic sovereignty" via the Jerusalem
Committee over the Islamic shrines in the holy city, an idea which
Israeli officials have said they totally reject.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also briefed Mubarak on the PCC's decision to postpone
statehood declaration and to reconvene by November 15 to consider
further steps in this regard, the Egyptian minister told reporters.
</P>
<P>
PCC's decision is intended to give a chance to the international
community, Israel and other concerned parties to seek a
breakthrough and reach a peace agreement between the Palestinians
and Israel, el-Sharif quoted Arafat as saying.
</P>
<P>
El-Sharif said the two leaders exchanged views on Clinton's
proposals on resuming the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on the
issues discussed at the Camp David summit, which ended on July 25
without an agreement mainly due to disputes over the status of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks are expected to resume
within the coming few weeks with the U.S. participation, he added,
without giving a date.
</P>
<P>
Monday's visit is Arafat's eighth to Egypt since the collapse of
the Camp David summit. He has left for Oman after talks with
Mubarak.

CAIRO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Agricultural engineers and farmers in the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) can now get information on farming, post their
queries and receive answers from experts, through a new service on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The Internet service has been launched by the International
Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) Arab
Peninsula Regional Program's (APRP) regional office in Dubai, in
cooperation with the Central Lab for Agriculture in Egypt, the
official WAM news agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The service will not only offer information to agricultural
engineers but also solve their problems on the spot.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran's export of marine products is to exceed 100
million U.S. dollars during the current Iranian calendar year
(started March 20), while the figure stood at 63 million dollars
last year.
</P>
<P>
Caviar, one of Iran's major non-oil exports, will make up 50
percent of the total export value, Lotfollah Saidi, deputy chief of
Iran's Fisheries Organization, said.
</P>
<P>
Saidi said that some 155 million dollars have been allocated for
the purchase of nine fishing trawlers in a bid to raise the fishery
capacity of the country.
</P>
<P>
Some 14 new fishing ports are also under construction, five of
them will be completed and join the present 67 fishing ports by
March 2001.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The Jeddah-based Islamic Corporation for
Development of the Private Sector (ICD) and the Bahrain-based Gulf
Finance House (GFH) have agreed to set up the Injazat Technology
Fund, the first of its kind to finance technology development in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The 50-million-U.S.-dollar fund will be jointly undertaken by
GFH and ICD, which will invest 12.5 million dollars each, and the
expected life of the fund is five years.
</P>
<P>
The Communications Development Corporation (CDC), a Dubai-based
company, will provide investment, banking and corporate advisory
services as a technical advisor to the Injazat Technology Fund.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be set up in Bahrain and will also operate from
the Dubai Internet City once the application formalities are
completed.
</P>
<P>
It will invest in small- and medium-sized technology companies
in the Gulf, the Middle East and North Africa.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The number of mobile phone users in Egypt is expected
to soar to 5.74 million by 2003 from the current 1.4 million,
according to a study conducted by Egypt's leading communication
consultant Gertner Group International.
</P>
<P>
Egypt would thus step up to the third place after Turkey and
South Africa in terms of cellular phone subscriber number in the
Middle East and Africa region.
</P>
<P>
RAMALLAH -- The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) has reached
an agreement with Jordan on expanding bilateral trade ties.
</P>

The deal would help remove obstacles in bilateral trade and
speed up the establishment of a joint free trade zone by 2007, said
Jordanian attache at the Palestinian territories Adnan al-Azab.
</P>
<P>
The deal would facilitate bilateral trade movement and promote
marketing and competition levels of each country's products, he
added.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Step up Sex Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has adopted
a recommendation to intensify sex education that covers not only
the physical aspect but all the areas, said South African
Education Minister Kader Asmal in Pretoria on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A national focus will be given to highlight the importance of
responsible parenthood, respect for young girls and the prevention
of teenage pregnancies to curb the rocketing HIV infection rate
among adolescents, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the level of HIV infection among
adolescents aged younger than 20 had risen from six percent in
1994 to 21 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of all new HIV infections are among those aged
between 15 and 24, he said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the figures as frightening, Asmal said sex education
at school would be stepped up to promote a healthy lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of sex education is really health education and
the prevention of unwanted pregnancies," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the council of education ministers is intended to hold
a workshop with churches, trade unions, business and non-
government bodies.
</P>
<P>
"The role of the churches could be very important because the
future of our children is at stake," he stressed.

relations with nations of the Baltic region, and respects the
efforts by the people of those countries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Report Accuses Entertainment Industry of Targeting Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. government report
Monday accused the movie, video game and music industries of
aggressively marketing restricted violent products to underage
youths.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was released by the Federal Trade Commission
(FTC), said that such violent movies and video games are routinely
targeted toward younger people.
</P>
<P>
The report said materials submitted by the industry itself
showed intentional plans to promote their products to underage
audiences.
</P>
<P>
"The younger the audience, the more likely they are to be
influenced by TV advertising," one document from the entertainment
industry said.
</P>
<P>
The report was made under instructions of President Bill
Clinton and Congress after a deadly campus shooting incident in
which two students killed a teacher and 12 students before taking
their own lives in April last year.
</P>
<P>
"Target marketing to children of entertainment products with
violent content is pervasive and aggressive," FTC chairman Robert
Pitofsky said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The report found that of 44 movies rated R, which means only
for adults, 80 percent were marketed to youngsters.
</P>
<P>
And of 55 music recordings with "explicit" content labels, all
of them were marketed to children under 17, the report said. Of
118 electronic games with a "mature" rating for violence, 70
percent were targeted to children under 17.
</P>
<P>
The FTC report charged that Hollywood's practices undermined
the credibility of the ratings system used by the entertainment
industry to warn parents about the violent content of movies,
music and video games.

Latvia, which commands great geographical importance in the

Baltic states' aspirations "to return to Europe" and to join the
European Union (EU) because these are choices made in accordance
with their own conditions.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to see a stronger EU as one pole of a multi-polar
world," the Chinese leader said.
</P>
<P>
Berzins, for his part, said the Latvian people appreciate China
's kindness and friendly sentiments.

sticking to a one-China policy is the prerequisite and basis for
the stable and long-term development of bilateral ties.

trade cooperation with China. He put forward some suggestions
concerning the utilization of Riga port and the Eurasia
Continental Bridge.

"The Palestinians have clearly called for continuation of talks
with Israel and confirmed their intention to reach an
understanding on a permanent status of Palestinian territories,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Palestine "did not take unilateral steps that would lead to
negative consequences for the peace process in the Middle East,"
Interfax quoted the official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Moscow believes there is still a chance to reach a Palestinian-
Israeli agreement and this should be fully taken advantage of, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Sredin expressed his regret that Palestinians and Israelis "
still have serious differences over the entire spectrum of a
permanent settlement, in particular borders, settlements, refugees,
water resources and, the most sensitive issue, the status of East
Jerusalem."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Barak to Rewrite Agenda to Save Political Future by Qi Deliang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The countdown for Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's political future begins Monday evening when
he returns home from the United Nations Millennium Summit in New
York.
</P>
<P>
Faced with domestic political crisis, Barak has to leave the
sweet memories of meetings with the world leaders in New York
behind and focus his attention on ways to resolve political
problems at home.
</P>
<P>
By October 30, when Israeli Knesset (parliament) reconvenes
after its three-month recess, Barak must form a coalition that in
the first week of November will be able to help him repulse a no-
confidence vote, push through the 2001 state budget and bury the
bill of dissolving the Knesset and holding early elections.
</P>
<P>
Barak is scheduled to hold urgent meetings shortly after his
return Monday with key members and cabinet ministers of his One
Israel to brief them on his U.S. trip and his political agenda that
he plans to rewrite.
</P>
<P>
But in reality, each political task is much grayer and
frustrating for him to handle.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the July Camp David peace talks with the
Palestinians, all the ultra-Orthodox parties including Shas, the
third largest party in Knesset, and National Religious Party (NRP)
left the coalition, making the government a minority one in the
parliament. Political differences with Shas also led to the quit of
the cabinet ministers of moderate Meretz, the key coalition partner
of One Israel.
</P>
<P>
Six weeks elapsed, Barak has not taken Meretz back yet. Meretz
leader Yossi Sarid accompanied Barak to the New York summit; but
Barak did not give a clear indication about Meretz's future,
forcing Sarid to declare that Meretz will neither join a coalition
that will not move the peace process forward, nor one that will
include the opposition Likud party.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether Shas and NRP are willing to rejoin the
coalition. But what is sure is that a future minority government
formed with Meretz, the Center Party, Shinui (religious reform
party) and supported by 10 Arab Knesset members from outside will
be shaky at the mercy of the caprices of each individual lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
Barak's other option is to form a national unity government with
hawkish Likud, the opponent of the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
To bring Likud into the coalition, Barak will have to publicly
declare the death of the peace process on both the Palestinian and
Syrian tracks. In so doing, Barak will lose American support, dig a
deep pit between himself and senior members of One Israel, and lose
support of all his voters. Barak won wide support in last year's
elections on a platform of making peace with Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Before going to New York last week, Barak initiated a "civil
reform" plan to finish formulating a constitution within one year,
which will include the abolition of the Religious Affairs Ministry,
introduction of civil marriage and letting all the state-funded
schools study three core subjects of English, mathematics and
civics.
</P>
<P>
In New York, he expanded his plan by calling for more public
transport and flight by Israel's national carrier El Al on Sabbath.
Traditionally, Jews refrain from any work on Sabbath, which runs
from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Barak's plan not only incurred disagreement within One Israel,
but angered the ultra-Orthodox parties. Shas and NRP have said
Barak was declaring a religious war within the country.
</P>
<P>
Barak's "civil reform" plan aims to prepare for new elections
and give a signal to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat that he will
focus on domestic straits instead of the peace talks. Political
observers here believe, however, that only a peace agreement with
the Palestinians will save Barak from political perdition.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Arafat held separate meetings in New York with U.S.
President Bill Clinton to chart a course for the peace talks to
proceed. On Sunday, the Palestinian leadership decided to postpone
the declaration of Palestinian statehood again and to have peace
talks with Israel for five weeks.
</P>
<P>
This allows more time for the peace talks to succeed. But the
future of Jerusalem, a holy city to Jews, Muslims and Christians,
remains a sticking point in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
It had been the deal-breaker in the Camp David summit.
Palestinians want traditionally Arab East Jerusalem, captured by
Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, as the capital of their future
state, while Israel claims the whole of Jerusalem as its "eternal
and undivided" capital.
</P>
<P>
Barak suggested Sunday that he was willing to consider less than
full Israeli sovereignty over the site, provided it was not handed
to sole Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told Clinton last week in New York that he would accept "
Islamic sovereignty" over the holy site, under the auspices of
several Arab countries such as Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and
Morocco.
</P>
<P>
If he could obtain a peace agreement with the Palestinians
favored by the Israeli public, Barak would regain his political
edge and could ask the Knesset to choose either a referendum or an
election centering on the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Barak has to rewrite his political agenda as soon as possible by
taking measures to form a new coalition, push the budget through
the Knesset, handle properly the "civil reform" plan and speed up
peace talks with the Palestinians. Otherwise, his political future
will be in jeopardy and his government will be a goodby one.

<HEADLINE> Greece Pledges Cooperation With Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Greece and Cyprus are working
together to find a solution to the Cyprus issue and Greece supports
the island's accession to the European Union (EU), said Greece's
new ambassador to Cyprus on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at Cyprus' southern Larnaca airport, Ambassador
Christos Panagopoulos said the message he conveys from Athens is "
togetherness, further forging of national unanimity" and securing
cooperation between the governments of Greece and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island after a
failed coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Three rounds of U.N.-sponsored proximity talks between the two
Cypriot communities have been held since last December, which aimed
at paving the way for substantive negotiations to reach a
settlement in Cyprus. The fourth round will open in New York on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus started substantive accession negotiations with the EU in
November 1998. It hopes to be admitted as an EU member by January
2003.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador noted that as long as Turkey sticks to its "
intransigent policy" on the issue, Greece must help Cyprus upgrade
its defense capability, in the context of a joint defense pact
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact signed in 1993, Greece will provide military
assistance to Cyprus in case the Mediterranean island is attacked.
</P>
<P>
The senior diplomat said that "the strategic aim is to obtain
such circumstances that will allow the survival of Cypriot
hellenism in conditions of security and future prosperity."
</P>
<P>
To this end, Athens and Nicosia have defined the U.N. Security
Council decisions on Cyprus as guidelines to achieve a solution,
which must provide for the reunification of the island, the
establishment of a bizonal, bicommunal federation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there is full cooperation between the two
governments to achieve this goal.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Backs Efforts to Stabilize Oil Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Oil-rich Saudi Arabia on
Monday reaffirmed its support to all efforts employed to stabilize
world oil markets.
</P>
<P>
The pledge was made during a cabinet session chaired by King
Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz in the western Saudi city of Jeddah.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Council of Ministers praised the cooperation at the
ministerial meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) in Vienna on Sunday, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
OPEC oil ministers agreed on a compromised agreement of
increasing their output by 800,000 barrels per day from October 1
to curb the runaway oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The new OPEC move was aimed at pushing prices down into its
preferred range of 22-28 U.S. dollars a barrel. Oil prices in
London recently soared to its 10-year high of over 33 dollars per
barrel.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, which sits on about 26 percent of the total world
oil reserves, has thrown its weight behind efforts exerted to cool
down high oil prices.
</P>
<P>
During a recent visit to New York, Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah
Ibn Abdul-Aziz called for "stable prices to guarantee the interests
of both producers and consumers."
</P>
<P>
He said oil-producing countries must assume their
responsibilities with a view to bringing fairness to both producers
and consumers.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Students Protest "IMF Intervention" in Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- University students in Ankara
and Istanbul on Monday protested the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) for what they called intervention in Turkey's economy, and
rapped the government for submitting its economic policies to the
world body.
</P>
<P>
A group of students from Student Coordination of Ankara's
Universities came to the capital's Sakarya Avenue with banners,
shouting slogans against the IMF, Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Go away the IMF, this country is not for sale," students
shouted. The students later walked to the Human Rights Monument
located at Yuksel Avenue of the central city and then dispersed.
</P>
<P>
In Istanbul, a group of 30 protestors were taken into custody by
police after they attempted to hold a demonstration in front of the
U.S. Consulate.
</P>
<P>
The group comprising university and high school students was
stopped by police, and the students opened banners protesting the
IMF and threw eggs at the security forces who blocked them to
proceed further.
</P>
<P>
After the incident, the police took some protestors into custody
and brought them to the Istanbul Security Directorate.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is implementing a three-year economic stability program
under the 4-billion-dollar stand-by deal signed with the IMF last
December.
</P>
<P>
Under the three-year loan package approved by the IMF, Turkey
pledged to reduce its chronic inflation and budget deficits,
undertake a comprehensive privatization program and reform
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The government aims to reduce inflation to 20 percent in 2000,
10 percent in 2001 and 5.0 percent in 2002. The annual inflation
rate stood at 68.9 percent in January of this year.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the IMF Turkey-desk Chief Carlo Cottarelli led
a delegation to Turkey for the third regular review of the deal,
upon which the IMF board should release the fourth tranche of the 4
billion dollars stand-by loan -- around 300 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The IMF team inspected possible measures by the government on
monetary and fiscal policies for next year within the framework of
the 2001 budget plans.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Cottarelli expressed optimistic about the
privatization programme in the country, saying that it is possible
that further progress will be achieved in Turk Telekom sell-off and
other privatizations.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit defended the
governmental policies, saying that expressing concerns and putting
forward recommendations by international organizations from which
Turkey seeks help "are natural."
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the claim that the government's submission to
outside pressures, saying that "it is our state, together with the
relevant social groups, that determines the economic, social and
financial policies of Turkey."

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM Works to Win Understanding for "Social Plan" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak is in favor of a "covenant" between religious and secular
Jews as he makes efforts to implement his "social reform agenda,"
the Prime Minister's Office said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A number of teams have been asked to draw up suggestions and
they have been working on the subject for a while, according to a
statement released by the office.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to reach an agreement on preserving the Jewish and
Zionist nature of the state alongside the modernization of the
country, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
While declining to predict how long it takes the prime minister
to reach the religious-secular "covenant," Baker David, a spokesman
for Barak's office, told Xinhua that it has always been Barak's
efforts to achieve an understanding between different sectors of
the society.
</P>
<P>
The purpose, said David, is to provide the secular population "
an opportunity to do what they have never done before," partly
referring to Barak's promise to allow buses to run on Sabbath so as
to carry some carless poor immigrants to the beach or other
recreational areas, and to allow the state-run airline El Al to
operate on Sabbath to facilitate its privatization.
</P>
<P>
That is part of his "civil agenda," David said, adding that the
ethic behind the agenda is to create an equitable, freer and
orderly society not at the expense of certain groups of the
population.
</P>
<P>
The social agenda, said the spokesman, reflects the prime
minister's long-time intentions to bridge social differences and
turn the society into a more tolerant one.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, Minister of Science, Culture and Sports Matan
Vilnai said: "The government is able to raise several banners at
once...There is a close connection between social development and
the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Barak has been criticized for promoting his "secular
revolution," which came as a surprise in August, concerning
disbanding of the Ministry of Religous Affairs, allowing civil
marriages and imposing national service for all, including the
ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students and Arab Israeli youths.
</P>
<P>
The move was disliked by both the religious parties and Barak's
own Labor party, for fear that it might change the country's
religious status quo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Jewish leaders in New York on Sunday, Barak said he
will be absolutely committed to his "civil agenda" which is seen by
analysts as a path of escape that Barak has designed for himself in
case the peace talks with the Palestinians end in failure.
</P>
<P>
He told the Jewish leaders that the agenda intended to "set
right the presently distorted situation, which prevents large
sectors of the population from receiving services that a democratic
nation must provide its citizens."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Barak stressed that the current effort in the
peace process was a historic opportunity that must not be missed.
</P>
<P>
Returning from his trip to the United Nations on Monday, Barak
will be faced with uphill tasks of reshuffling his coalition and
pushing ahead the stalled peace process.

<HEADLINE> 24 Iranians Sentenced for Taking Part in Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian court has sentenced
24 people to one to five years in prison for taking part in riots
and attacks on public buildings in March in the northwestern city
of Khalkhal, a judiciary official announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 52 people were tried for their involvement in the
riots, which were sparked by a decision by the conservative
Guardians Council (GC) to annul the results of the February 18
Majlis (parliament) elections in the town.
</P>
<P>
But only 24 of them were found guilty of damaging public
properties, and the others were acquitted, said Amir Sohrab Beig,
head of the justice department of Ardabil Province, where the town
is located.
</P>
<P>
The official said that those convicted have 20 days to appeal to
have their lawsuits forwarded to the provincial appeals court.
</P>
<P>
Pro-reform allies of President Mohammad Khatami won an
overwhelming victory in the February elections, ending the long-
time conservative domination in the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
But the conservative GC, the top supervisor of the election,
cancelled election results in a number of constituencies, and in
some cases even replaced reformist winners with their conservative
rivals. The measure sparked protests in the related constituencies.

<HEADLINE> Israel Not to Pay for Palestinian Delay of Statehood: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli acting Foreign
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami Monday welcomed the Palestinian decision to
postpone the declaration of statehood, but refused to regard it as
a favor that Israel should pay for in return.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami said he did not see any change in Palestinian National
Authority Yasser Arafat's attitude in the peace talks. Arafat wants
an agreement and "their idea to postpone the declaration means they
want to exhaust" the possibility for striking a peace deal, he told
Xinhua at a press conference in the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"To make it very clear," said he, "the fact that they postponed
the unilateral declaration should not be seen an ingredient in the
negotiations. This is not an item Israel should pay for in terms of
assets of negotiations."
</P>
<P>
"This is a free decision taken by the Palestinians after having
evaluated all the constraints that existed. We of course think it
is commendable that they decided to postpone. It is good for the
process."
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami told reporters that whether the peace talks will achieve
progress "depends much on the attitude" of the negotiators. He said
that if both sides would "build on the impressions that we have
gathered from Camp David," there is still hope for progress in the
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Asked by Xinhua about whether the two sides would strive for a
framework deal instead of a comprehensive final accord considering
the difficulties involved in the final status talks, Ben-Ami said "
a framework agreement is feasible," but at the same time, he
stressed that "being feasible does not mean he (Arafat) will take
the final decisions."
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami praised Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's courage as
shown in the Camp David summit and called on Arafat to exercise the
faculties of leadership when the moment of truth arrives.
</P>
<P>
The acting foreign minister, who will leave for U.N. General
Assembly on Tuesday, said that Arafat's delay of statehood
declaration gave the peace process "a new lease on life." He said
that the two parties should do their utmost to exhaust the
possibility within the time frame that is allowed.
</P>
<P>
However, he played down expectations for a major breakthrough in
the future talks which will be given only four or five weeks of
time, saying that "there is no much or excessive room for hope."
</P>
<P>
He said Israel has supported the U.S. proposals on delaying the
Jerusalem issue which is the major stumbling block for the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
According to their Sharm el Sheikh accord signed last September,
the two sides should complete a permanent peace deal on all final
status issues which also include borders, water, Jewish settlements
and Palestinian refugees, by the mutually-agreed deadline of
September 13.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. bridging ideas on deferring the negotiations of the Old
City in Jerusalem, or the entire Jerusalem have been rejected by
the Palestinians who want to build an independent state with East
Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
The Old city in the traditionally Arab East Jerusalem, home to
the Temple Mount, the most sacred in Judaism, and a number of holy
shrines of Islam, was captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East
war.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami said that following the U.N. Millennium Summit where U.
S. President Bill Clinton made intensive mediation efforts to help
strike a peace deal, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators resumed
talks on Sunday in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the negotiations have never stopped since the July Camp
David summit, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Barak hailed the Palestinian postponement of
statehood as a "positive step," saying that the historic
opportunity must not be missed.
</P>
<P>
Both Israelis and Palestinians have seen October as their
deadline for further negotiations considering the fact that by the
time U.S. congress will go into recess so that it will not be
possible to endorse the massive aid packages needed to back a peace
deal, and that the Israeli parliament will reopen probably with a
wave of no-confidence votes for Barak's minority government.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who has been trying to strike a peace deal with the
Palestinians to fulfil his major election pledge 18 months ago, has
delayed the reshuffling of his government, waiting to see in what
direction the peace process will go.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Arafat Hold Talks on Palestinian-Israeli Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
began talks with visiting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Monday
evening on future policy in negotiations with Israel that resumed
Monday after a six-week hiatus.
</P>
<P>
The meeting started immediately after Arafat's arrival at the
Borg al Arab airport, west of Egypt's Mediterranean port city of
Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has frequently visited Egypt to consult Mubarak, the key
mediator in the Palestinian-Israeli peace process, strategies in
dealing with Israel. The current visit came one day after the
Palestine Central Council (PCC) decided to delay the declaration of
an independent state while Arafat agreed to have peace talks with
Israel for five weeks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat had earlier said amid a deadlock peace to proclaim an
independent state as early as on September 13, the deadline set
with Israel for a permanent peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders were expected to focus on the outcome of the
just concluded meeting of the PCC, which will meet again by
November 15 to consider when to declare statehood, Palestinian
Ambassador to Egypt Zohdi al Qedra said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is reportedly to go on to Oman on Tuesday for a meeting
with Sultan Qabus Bin Said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials have underlined the importance to
strengthen consultation and coordination with Arab leaders.

<P>
TEHRAN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Eighteen Iranians will soon
stand trial for alleged involvement in murdering several opposition
figures and dissident intellectuals in Tehran at the end of 1998,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tehran's military court has issued indictment against the 18
people and a court hearing will be held, said Abdol Reza Izadpanah,
a judiciary official in charge of social affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said the defendants have 10 days to introduce defense lawyers
to the court, otherwise they will be provided with court-appointed
lawyers. The official, however, did not disclose the status of the
accused.
</P>
<P>
Darius Forouhar, a veteran political activist who headed the
Iran Nation Party, his wife, and several dissident writers were
mysteriously killed in late 1998.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Intelligence Ministry had admitted some of its own agents
had been involved in the killings, which shocked the Iranian
society and forced former Intelligence Minister Qobanali Dorri
Najafabadi to resign.
</P>
<P>
The case also led to the suicide in prison of Former Deputy
Intelligence Minister for Political and Security Affairs Saeed
Emami, who was arrested last year for his major role in the

CAIRO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran will soon deliver two mobile power transmission
units to Lebanon as part of the efforts to help its reconstruction,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The first unit will be delivered to Lebanon next week and the
other next month, said Bahman Masoudi, deputy head of the Power
Generation and Distribution Center.
</P>
<P>
He added that the new equipment is to replace those damaged
during Israeli bombardment of Lebanon early this year. The two
units cost between 1.5 to 2 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Nearly 1 billion dirhams (273.2 million U.S.
dollars) will be spent on improving and upgrading Dubai's road
network this year, the official WAM news agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Besides, more than 400 million dirhams (109.3 million dollars)
will be spent on sewerage and drainage projects in the emirate.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, 970.04 million dirhams (265.03 million
dollars) have been earmarked for roads, including the stage four of
Dubai city's ring road and 412 million dirhams (112.6 million
dollars) on expanding the Al Aweer Sewage Treatment, and completing
the city's rain water drainage network at a cost of 300 million
dirhams (81.96 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The outlay more than doubled the 538.2 million dirhams (147
million dollars) spent five years ago.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan's trade deficit during the first five months of
this year widened as the kingdom's imports more than doubled its
exports, the central bank said in its monthly bulletin on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The import volume stood at 1.1 billion Jordanian dinars (1.54
billion U.S. dollars) as against the export volume of 418.9 million
dinars (586.5 million dollars) during the January-May period, the
bulletin said.
</P>
<P>
Medical and pharmaceutical products topped the kingdom's export
list during the first five months, while transport equipments, cars
and spare parts accounted for the major part of its imports.
</P>
<P>
Iraq remained Jordan's largest trading partner during the

<HEADLINE> Regional Blood Transfusion Workshop Opens in Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A four-week quality management
training workshop for blood transfusion service providers in the
African region started here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, the first of its kind, is held following a
meeting of experts last year where the need for quality management
in blood transfusion services was emphasized, said director for
blood safety and clinical technology of the World Health
Organization (WHO) Jean Emmanuel.
</P>
<P>
The workshop would cover the need to ensure safe blood donors,
quality storage, quality transportation of blood and the correct
blood type, the director said, explaining that the quality
management project has various components which include training
and establishment of laboratories.
</P>
<P>
"If we train people, they will go back to their countries with
knowledge to ensure that these things are put in place," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said similar workshops would be carried out in other parts
of the world including Asia and America. Zimbabwe has been
selected as a venue for the training because it is a collaborative
center for work carried out by the organization in the region, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe is the only country in Africa which has since 1994
been a collaborative center for WHO's blood transfusion services,
but we hope to get more countries if they meet certain standards,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
About 30 participants from Kenya, Botswana, Uganda, South
Africa, Eritrea, Zambia, Malawi, Ghana and Nigeria are attending
the workshop.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the workshop, Zimbabwe's Health and Child Welfare
Minister Timothy Stamps reiterated the need to teach the public on
the importance of blood and its safety.
</P>
<P>
Quality control of blood is essential in the wake of the HIV/
AIDS pandemic, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the WHO, each year unsafe blood transfusion and
injection practices accounted for 80,000 to 160,000 HIV infections
in the developing world.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Urged to Involve Communities in Handling Airport Emergencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The eastern and
southern African countries have been urged to involve communities
surrounding airports in handling emergencies which the airport
authorities in the region can not manage on their own.
</P>
<P>
"Handling of airport emergencies requires a coordinated program
between the airport and the surrounding community," said Salim
Msoma, permanent secretary in Tanzanian Ministry of Communications
and Transport, on Monday while speaking at the opening ceremony of
a five-day international workshop on aerodrome emergency planning
in the eastern and southern African countries.

He said the airport authorities in the region can not on their
own have the necessary human or material resources needed to
handle emergencies, especially of great magnitude.
</P>

A discussion on how to handle aircraft and other airport
emergencies will enhance safety in air travel, he said.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, organized by the International Civil Aviation
Organization in conjunction with the Tanzanian Airports Authority
and attended by delegates from more than 16 African countries, is
intended to review the status of aerodrome emergency planning in
the region and stress on the importance of airports emergency
procedures.
</P>
<P>
It will also stress the need to conduct regular emergency
drills to test the efficiency of those procedures and the
readiness of various state organs in implementing them, organizers
said.

LAGOS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Ministry of Aviation
Monday called on its U. S. counterpart to provide assistance for
the country's fledgling aviation industry and make it benefit from
the Open Sky Agreement signed lately by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Meeting a U. S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
delegation in the capital Abuja, Nigeria's Aviation Minister Kema
Chikwe said it is necessary, at the current stage, to accelerate
the accreditation by the FAA to Nigerian airlines and
administrative agencies for their operation in the U. S. airspace.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's aviation industry resumed in August direct flights to
the United States after long-time suspension. The country needs to
improve its airspace management to meet international standards,
Chikwe said.
</P>
<P>
On his side, Edward Jones, head of the U. S. delegation and FAA
representative in Africa, said he has come with various

<HEADLINE> Liberal Democrats: Britain Almost Meeting Tests to Join Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The five tests laid down by
Chancellor Golden Brown for UK entry into the euro were "in the
process of being met," according to a report commissioned by the
Liberal Democrats.
</P>
<P>
The commission of 14 economists, which included former member
of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, said UK entry
was "perfectly feasible" but the government must prepare the
ground now.
</P>
<P>
The report came Monday as the Institute of Directors said
Britain was "a long way off" achieving convergence with the euro
zone. In its report for the Liberal Democrats, the commission said
the business cycles of the two economic areas were converging.
</P>
<P>
There was no reason to believe that the UK's financial or
economic structure made adoption of the euro uniquely problematic,
it added.
</P>
<P>
The commission said it was vital the government adopted a
timetable to ensure UK full membership of the euro before a
general election to prevent a political campaign destabilizing the
pound.
</P>
<P>
It identified a range of DM2.45 to DM2.84 against the German
mark at which the UK economy could compete. This compares with a
closing rate last week of DM3.21. "Sterling remains overvalued
against the euro at the levels prevailing during the summer of
2000," the report said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Stresses Development Issue at UNDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS,September 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan urged here Monday the international
community to contribute more to world peace and development, a
target set at the newly-concluded Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a United Nations Development Program (UNDP)
ministerial meeting at the U.N. headquarters, Tang said that in
view of the globalization's negative impacts on developing
countries and widening gap between the north and south, to
effectively facilitate the economic development of developing
countries is "both an essential condition for a long-term, stable
and healthy growth of the world economy and an important guarantee
for the maintenance of world peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations, the most broadly represented and universal
organization in the world today, should therefore be strengthened
rather than weakened in the area of development," said Tang, who
flew here a week ago accompanying Chinese President Jiang Zemin
for the three-day Millennium Summit held on September 6-8.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang left here for home Saturday after the summit
and Tang remained for the general debate of the 55th General
Assembly scheduled to start Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The summit ended Friday with a declaration, which calls for
fighting for development for all the peoples of the world and
fighting against poverty, ignorance and disease. "This is the
consensus and hope reached among member states at the U.N.
Millennium Summit," Tang said in his UNDP speech.
</P>
<P>
Tang voiced China's support for the UNDP's exploratory
adjustments or reform, urging the most important agency at the U.N.
development system to continue to concentrate on providing
development assistance to developing countries and adhere to the
principle of universality, neutrality and grant.
</P>
<P>
"The UNDP should base its development aid work on the actual
conditions and needs of the recipient states and give
consideration mainly to these elements," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed deep concern about decreasing core
resources at the UNDP's disposal, hoping that the international
community and the developed countries in particular "will show
their political will, fulfill their commitments, reverse the
downward trend of official development assistance as soon as
possible and increase their contributions to the UNDP's core
resources."
</P>
<P>
Last week's U.N. Millennium Summit decided that a high-level
international and intergovernmental event on financing for
development be held in 2001. Tang said that it is essential to
make it a success.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese minister also called for efforts to further south-
south cooperation "both in width and depth" and urged priority to
be given to knowledge economy factors such as information
technology.
</P>
<P>
Tang is expected to deliver a speech at the first day general
debate of the U.N. General Assembly Tuesday, further elaborating
China's stand on important international issues.

Opening a coordination mechanism meeting of the United Nations,
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the
government of Sierra Leone Monday at U.N. headquarters in New York,
Annan alerted the meeting of humanitarian implications of the
continued instability in Sierra Leone and the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The latest number of internally displaced persons in Sierra
Leone exceeds 300,000 with another 37,000 Sierra Leonean refugees
in neighboring Liberia, he added.
</P>
<P>
An August meeting of troop-contributing countries to the U.N.
Mission Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) highlighted the responsibility of
the entire international community to assist the U.N. to achieve a
political solution in Sierra Leone with the involvement of the
ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
RUF rebels reignited Sierra Leone's nine-year civil war in May
by seizing about 500 U.N. peacekeepers, which severely embarrassed
the U.N. and prompted a reassessment of the U.N. peacekeeping
mission in that country.
</P>
<P>
Annan has proposed that the strength of the UNAMSIL be
increased to 20,500 from the current ceiling of 13,000. The
proposal is under the Security Council's consideration.

<HEADLINE> 12 Victim Found in Italian Flood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Rain finally tapered off in the
Italian southern town of Soverato Monday, allowing rescue and
relief teams to continue their efforts which led to the discovery
of the 12th confirmed victim from Sunday's flash flood.
</P>
<P>
The Italian news agency Ansa reported that local police are
still uncertain over the exact number of people who may still be
missing but, based on an earlier estimate, they should be at least
four.
</P>
<P>
The uncertainty stemmed from the fact that it was not known
exactly how many were at the camp when the flood hit just before
dawn Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor's office in the region of Calabria has impounded
administrative documents in the town to Soverato, including the
license for the camp to operate, in order to ascertain whether the
campground was in line with the law and why some 45 percent of the
site itself was allowed to be in the river basin itself.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's flash flood came several weeks ahead of the
traditional period of flooding in Italy, October-November.
</P>
<P>
Available documents showed that over the past 80 years floods
have struck 169 towns in Calabria, out of a total of over 15,000
floods and 6,456 municipalities.
</P>
<P>
Venice is the Italian city which has experienced the greatest

<HEADLINE> Russia, Vietnam Sign Pacts on Energy Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Vietnam signed a
package of agreements here Monday after a meeting of Russian Prime
Minister Mikhail Kasyanov and his Vietnamese counterpart, Phan Van
Khai, to enhance bilateral trade and economic relations.
</P>
<P>
The talks focused on cooperation in the fuel and energy sphere,
including the joint production of oil and gas in Vietnam and in
the joint construction of Vietnam's first oil refinery.
</P>
<P>
In particular, an oil and gas contract was signed between
PetroVietnam, a Vietnamese oil and gas corporation, and Russia's
largest gas company Gazprom and Russia's overseas oil enterprise
Zarubezhneft to exploit Vietnam's continental shelf.
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation between the two countries in the oil and gas
industry is developing very actively.... The contract signed today
indicates that Gazprom is joining this cooperation and starting
its work in Vietnam," Kasyanov told the press after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Russian-Vietnamese joint venture Vietsovpetro is one of the
most promising projects and ranks among the world's best oil
companies, he said, noting that the construction of Vietnam's
first oil refinery has begun with Russian assistance.
</P>
<P>
The sides have identical approaches to ways of settling
international problems and to economic partnership. Russia will
adhere to the principle of broadening strategic cooperation with
Vietnam, Kasyanov stressed.
</P>
<P>
The premiers also discussed the problem of Vietnam's debt to
Russia.
</P>
<P>
"This issue has come to its logical completion. This problem
should be turned into a mechanism of cooperation," said Kasyanov.
</P>
<P>
Phan arrived in Moscow for an official visit Sunday afternoon.
Tuesday, he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese premier will also meet with Russian State Duma (
lower house of parliament) Chairman Gennady Seleznyov and Chairman
of the Federation Council (upper chamber) Yegor Stroyev, as well
as Russian and Vietnamese business people, the Russian Foreign
Ministry announced.
</P>
<P>
Russia's arms supply to Vietnam may be also one of the items on
the agenda of Phan Van Khai's talks in Moscow this week.
</P>
<P>
Thursday, Phan will travel from Moscow to Minsk for a visit.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Lift Oil Output Under OPEC Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran will increase its oil
output to 3.84 million barrels per day as of October 1 in
accordance with its new quota within the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), an Oil Ministry official said here on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
OPEC members, excluding Iraq, agreed in their Vienna meeting on
Sunday to add 800,000 barrels to their current oil production
ceiling of 25.4 million barrels per day as of October 1, said
Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, senior advisor to Iranian Oil Minister
Bijan Namdar Zanganeh.
</P>
<P>
He told the official IRNA news agency that with OPEC's new
production ceiling up to 26.2 million barrels per day, Iran's share
in the amount would rise to 3.84 million barrels per day from the
current 2.72 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
On the impact of OPEC's latest production hike, Ardebili said
the increase will bring oil prices down to some extent.
</P>
<P>
Although OPEC members had raised their production ceiling twice
since March, oil prices were still very high, surpassing 30 U.S.
dollars per barrel in recent days.
</P>
<P>
Ardebili said that demand for OPEC's oil in the last quarter of
2000 is expected to be around 28.9 million barrels per day, less
than the 26.2 million barrels approved by OPEC plus Iraq's daily
production of 3 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the surplus will be stocked because the global
demand for oil is less than the total oil production of OPEC and
non-OPEC producers in the fourth quarter of the current year.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Minister Urges to Enhance Regional Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Commerce, Trade and
Industry Minister William Harrington said Monday there is need for
greater regional integration if the region is to improve its
economic performance.
</P>
<P>
Harrington made the remarks here at the opening ceremony of the
sixth meeting of the Trade and Customs FTA (Free Trade Area)
Committee.
</P>
<P>
He noted that African countries have not yet succeeded in
improving their economies as shown by the levels of poverty,
infant mortality, life expectancy and industrial development.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said ever since its inception, the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) had made
tremendous strides in the quest for greater economic integration,
adding that the region was moving fast towards the establishment
of the FTA next month.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia had already published its legal instrument for
the zero rating tariffs to be applied on reciprocal basis from
October 31, urging other member countries to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
"Zambia recognizes the challenges of regional integration and
wishes to benefit from the wider market the FTA will create. It is
only in this way can we move our people to a better world," he
said.
</P>
<P>
At the same function, COMESA Secretary General Erastus Mwencha
called for commitment from member countries to ensure successful
implementation of the FTA.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha also called on member states to guard against the "
catch up" theory, which was based on the premise that the region
should industrialize first before integrating, and catch up later.
</P>
<P>
This theory was going to be risky given the realities that
obtained in the region and the global dynamics, he said.

MOSCOW, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Two people have died from
severe burns received in an explosion at a fireworks firm in
Vilnius, capital of Lithuania, the Interfax news agency reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The firm's production director, Arunas Balsis, 32, died on
September 6 from burns covering nearly his entire body, and the
firm's engineer, Vidmantas Cerniauskas, 28, died Sunday from burns
over 60 percent of his body, Interfax cited the Vilnius clinic as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The blast occurred on September 5 when explosive substances
caught fire in the office of the Blikas, a Vilnius pyrotechnic
firm specializing in fireworks. Fire in the premises was
extinguished before the firefighters' arrival. Nobody was killed
in the blast, but several people were injured. The building
suffered minor damage.

<HEADLINE> Albania Becomes WTO's 138th Member </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Albania formally joined the
World Trade Organization (WTO) on September 8 after eight years of
negotiations for its WTO membership, according to a WTO press
release Monday.
</P>
<P>
Greeting the event that Albania has become WTO's 138th member,
WTO Director-General Mike Moore said, "I welcome Albania into the
multilateral trading system. Membership promises a more prosperous
future and raises living standards for all Albanian citizens."
</P>
<P>
"I also believe that by encouraging the trade links between
countries, WTO can help foster greater peace, stability and
development in southeastern Europe. Albania's membership brings
this organization ever closer to being a truly 'World Trade
Organization.'"
</P>
<P>
Albania applied for membership of WTO's predecessor GATT in
1992. Negotiations on its terms of accession to WTO then started
in earnest in 1998. The WTO General Council adopted the final
results of these negotiations on July 17, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Truckers' Protest Paralyzes Belgian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Belgian truck drivers
angered by rising oil prices continued their protest Monday to
force the government into accepting their demands for a price cut
on diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred truck drivers blocked main roads leading to
downtown Brussels to press for lower fuel taxes and lower prices
for oil-reliant products and services.
</P>
<P>
Taxi drivers and tour bus operators joined the protest on
Sunday. Overnight negotiations between protesters and the
government failed to yield any results.
</P>
<P>
Truckers also blockaded Belgium's largest oil refinery
Totalfina in Feluy, Hainault, preventing tankers from getting new
supplies. They also blockaded the Esso depot in the southern town
of Tournai and blocked petrol distributors in the west from
replenishing their supplies.
</P>
<P>
The drivers vowed to continue the protest unless their demands
were met. They claim diesel fuel prices have increased by half
since the beginning of 1999, which is threatening their business.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the problem is being felt elsewhere in Europe, they
demanded immediate action by the European Union. Their action is
amid a wave of similar protests across Europe.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Belgium's Secretary of State
responsible for energy Olivier Deleuze proposed Monday to offer
the country's 100,000 poor families a total of 1,000 liters of
free heating oil this winter.
</P>
<P>
He added that the oil sector should pay the bill to offset the
impact by the price hike on these families.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
agreed in Vienna to raise oil production by 800,000 barrels a day.
The move has brought the price of oil down slightly on the
international market.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Upbeat over Results at Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkish State Minister in
charge of sports Fikret Unlu said on Monday that he is very much
hopeful over the performance of Turkish athletes at the Olympic
games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Unlu, prior to his departure from Ankara to Sydney, told
reporters that the biggest motivation for the athletes is that the
awards had been announced before the games, reported the Anatolia
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"The winning athletes will work as a sports consultant after
they are 30 years old," Unlu said. "They will be paid the wages of
a first-degree government worker and therefore their future is
guaranteed."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the announcement of awards to be given to Turkish
athletes had raised expectations from them in Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"We want to win more medals than we did in 1960 at Rome
Olympics," Unlu declared, referring to the fact that the Turkish
athletes won 7 gold medals in 1960.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the Turkish athletes who are
participating in the Olympics will also get morale support from
the Turkish workers living in Australia, adding that Australia,
after Germany, has the second highest number of Turks living
within its borders. Unlu expressed his conviction that Turkey
has a chance to win medals in every branch of sports which Turkish
athletes are to attend in Sydney.

BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government today
urged Chinese enterprises to pay more attention to production
safety.

<HEADLINE> GCC Army Chiefs to Discuss Military Cooperation Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Army Chiefs of Staff
of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states will meet in the Saudi
capital of Riyadh Tuesday to discuss issues concerning military and
defense cooperation among member nations.
</P>
<P>
A GCC military source in Riyadh said that the meeting will
follow up on the implementation of projects, plans and joint
military training decided by GCC leaders during their 20th summit
held in Riyadh last November.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting will discuss the establishment of a security
belt among the GCC states, the source said, quoted by the Kuwait
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Countries of the six-member GCC -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- have agreed to build
an early warning network at a cost of 80 million U.S. dollars by
the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
They have also agreed to establish a unified contact system
worth 70 million dollars to exchange information and data between
Gulf operation rooms.
</P>
<P>
As these projects were originally recommended by U.S. defense
officials who believed the GCC states still "face potential missile
attacks from regional countries such as Iran and Iraq," both of the
projects will be built with the help of Washington.

<HEADLINE> Rising Oil Prices to Erode Thailand's Mooncake Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Rising global oil prices will
hit Thailand's mooncake market hard, as the psychological effect
of dearer petrol causes consumers to buy fewer cakes, a report
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report released by the Thai Farmers Bank research center
suggested the runaway oil prices would generate psychological
effects on buyers and the number of mooncakes purchased would drop.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was based on a poll of 1,142 mooncake
enthusiasts, revealed most consumers polled planned to buy at
least one fewer cake this year than last year.
</P>
<P>
Although the total number of mooncakes purchased this year is
expected to fall, hard-core Moon Goddess worshippers will buy just
as many treats as in 1999, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Mooncake producers can help insure themselves against decreased
consumer spending by expanding their selling hours, using more
attractive packaging, making more varieties of cakes and adding
more sugar to the cakes, so that more people use the items not
only as ceremonial objects but also as desserts, the report said.
</P>
<P>
These preventative measure could "automatically expand the
market base" of the mooncake industry, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed
Sunday to boost daily global crude oil output by three per cent,
or 800,000 barrels, in a bid to ease soaring prices which has
sparked worldwide concern and protests in Europe.
</P>
<P>
But Western nations said the decision would be insufficient.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is particularly vulnerable to changes in world oil
prices, since the kingdom is highly dependent on oil. Oil
consumption in Thailand rose by nearly 80 percent between 1990 and
1998, according to the U.S. investment banking company Merrill
Linch.
</P>
<P>
The company forecasts that Thailand's growth rate will be
shaved by one percentage point or more in 2001 due largely to
higher import prices.
</P>
<P>
Oil accounts for close to 61 percent of Thailand's primary
energy consumption and natural gas 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The country imported 168 billion baht (4.2 billion U.S. dollars)
worth of oil last year.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Peacekeeping Troops to Monitor Ethio-Eritrean Ceasefire in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
peacekeeping troops will start monitoring in October the
implementation of the ceasefire agreement signed by Ethiopia and
Eritrea in June after more than two years of bloody war, the U.N.
sources said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of the U.N. peacekeeping mission along the
border between the two countries will be completed in October,
said the sources who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. announced in August that it was sending 100 liaison
officers each to Ethiopia and Eritrea to make the necessary
arrangements for the deployment of 4,200 peacekeepers to monitor
the ceasefire between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that at least 19 countries from Africa, Europe,
Asia and Latin America were ready to contribute troops to the U.N.
Peacekeeping Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE), which will
be deployed in the 25-kilometer "security zone" inside Eritrean
territory.
</P>
<P>
Currently, more than 70 Ethiopian military officers have
received orientation training to assist the U.N. peacekeeping
mission, the sources said.

WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Los Alamos physicist Wen Ho Lee has agreed to plead guilty
to a single felony count of improperly retaining classified
nuclear weapons data and could be released from jail Monday if a
federal judge in Albuquerque accepts a plea agreement negotiated
between Lee's attorneys and a team of prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
-- Responding to global fears about a looming energy crisis,
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed Monday to
raise daily production by 800,000 barrels in a bid to bring down
increased crude oil prices and avert a heating fuel shortage this
winter.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The story of the Firestone tire debacle, blamed for as many
as 150 deaths around the world, is one of missed hints, lost
opportunities and unsolved mysteries, a review of more than 100
company and government documents showed. Another hearing in
Congress will be held Tuesday on the issue.
</P>
<P>
-- Bowing to international pressure, Palestinian leaders
decided at a meeting on Sunday night, as expected, to postpone a
declaration of statehood and re-commit themselves to the Middle
East peace effort despite deeply deadlocked negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Antitrust regulators are expected to approve Covisint, a
huge online parts exchange established by the Big-Three auto
makers. Covisint could wield purchasing power of up to 240 billion
dollars a year. Over a dozen major parts suppliers have agreed to
join it.
</P>
<P>
-- Clinton proposed to spend about 1.6 billion dollars to help
communities recover from forest fires that have scorched more than

include thinning millions of acres of federal forests as
precaution against future blazes. Clinton also announced about 40
million dollars in funds for 90 restoration projects in the region.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Wins Macedonian Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The "For Macedonia Together,"
the opposition alliance in Macedonia, won a "great victory" in
Sunday's local elections by taking control of most large cities,
Branko Crvenkovski, the leader of the group, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The group won an overwhelming number of votes in the first
round in Skopje, capital of Macedonia, as well as in Ohrid Stip,
Kocani, Veles and other major cities, Crvenkovski said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski will fulfill his
pledge and call for early parliamentary elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
Georgievski promised to hold early elections if the government
coalition of his VMRO DPMNE, the Democratic Alternative and the
Democratic Party of Albanians, lost the local vote by more than 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
Elections went smoothly in most areas, and clashes only
occurred in areas inhabited by Albanians. Eight people were
reportedly injured.

<HEADLINE> Hungary's Inflation to Increase Due to Rising Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Hungary's annual inflation
rate is expected to reach 9 percent this year, 0.5 percentage
points higher than expected, due to the recent increase in oil
prices on the international market, economy experts said.
</P>
<P>
The price of oil per barrel in the international market rose
from 15-17 U.S. dollars last year to an average of 30 dollars at
present, which is expected to push the country's inflation rate to
9 percent this year, the Magyar Tavirati Irodaise (Hungarian News
Agency) quoted experts on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rocketing oil prices, however, will have a limited impact on
the Hungarian economy as the country's industries have gone
through large-scale restructuring in recent years, resulting in a
decreasing demand for energy.
</P>
<P>
Hungary's demand for energy has dropped by 25 percent during
the past 10 years.

<HEADLINE> China Welcomes Foreign Investors in SOEs Assets Restructuring (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Following Cinda, three other firms: Huarong, Changcheng and
Dongfang, were set up. They are responsible for the acceptance,
management and handling of debts and other bad assets.
</P>
<P>
So far, a total of 1,300 billion yuan (156.6 billion U.S.
dollars) of bad assets from SOEs have been turned over to the four
asset management companies from banks.
</P>
<P>
Cinda is responsible for handling 350 billion yuan of bad
assets from SOEs in the fields of infrastructure construction,
power, chemicals, machinery, manufacturing, raw materials and real
estate.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, Cinda and three other asset management
firms have played an important role in promoting SOE reform
through asset restructuring and debt converting.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jingyan, director of the foreign investment department under
the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, said that
2000 is the last year of the central government's three-year
campaign to lift SOEs out of the red.
</P>
<P>
China will open wider its domestic market, Hu said, foreign
investment is warmly welcomed in the reform of SOEs.
</P>
<P>
"Investment, technology and management expertise will help
speed up the reform and development of SOEs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yalin, senior financial manager of Delotte Touche Tohmatsu
Consultants (Shanghai) Ltd., said that purchasing or investing in
Chinese bad assets is a new, fast and cheap way for multinational
corporations to enter China's market.
</P>
<P>
"This will provide the corporations opportunities to enjoy the
country's natural resources and labor resources, ready-made sale
network and potential profits," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Welcomes Foreign Investors in SOEs Assets Restructuring (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- China Cinda Asset Management
Cooperation today announced a list of 38 projects that foreign
business people are welcome to participate in, to help restructure
the country's state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
</P>
<P>
Tian Guoli, vice-president of Cinda, made the announcement
while speaking to representatives of multinational corporations,
who are attending the on-going fourth China Fair for International
Investment and Trade.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in China that asset restructuring
projects have been available to domestic and overseas business
people. Cinda is the first of the country's four asset management
companies to announce such a list.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the list is to attract foreign investment to help
reform Chinese state-owned enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
The projects include dozens of large and medium sized SOEs in
the phosphor-ammonium industry, alumina powder production and
paper making.
</P>
<P>
Foreign business people are welcome to handle the projects by
converting and restructuring debts, Tian said, while Cinda will
provide a series of favorable policies for the investors.
</P>
<P>
Many SOEs are running at a loss following the long-term effects
of a planning economy system. The country's commercial banks have
kept many long-standing bad loans to SOEs, causing a severe impact
to the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problems, China set up China Cinda Asset
Management Cooperation in April 1999, the first company of its
kind in China.

<HEADLINE> HK Important for Market-Based Chinese Economy: Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is meeting with
an extraordinary opportunity to be an even greater commercial and
market center in the years ahead because of the potential for
economic growth in a market-based Chinese economy, said a U.S.
economist.
</P>
<P>
With China undergoing its great transformation, China must
develop market skills more broadly, and Hong Kong can play a
particularly pivotal role in this regard, said Robert E. Rubin,
chairman of the Executive Committee and member of the Office of
the Chairman of Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at a luncheon in Hong Kong, Rubin said a
market based financial system poses a great challenge for China,
as it requires an effective system of regulation and supervision,
and of well-established accounting standards and rules and
processes of law.
</P>
<P>
China has made achievement in the reform of state-owned
commercial banks, but it is still focused on substantially
increasing the alternatives to the banking system, especially the
development of robust bond and stock markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the financial institutions themselves need
strong credit cultures, strong investment cultures and large
numbers of professionals with the requisite experience and skills.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is world class locus of the entrepreneurial and
financial and market skills that China so greatly needs, and has
long served this function within broader Chinese economy, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He believes that giving foreign financial institutions greatly
increased access to China's financial services sector would help
China meet this need.
</P>
<P>
While China's financial institutions continue to develop, the
WTO agreement does move in this direction, he added.

<P>
JERUSALEM, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A new fellowship fund worth
2 million U.S. dollars designed to encourage advanced studies by
woman scientists was dedicated Monday at the Hebrew University of
Jerusalem, the most prestigious university in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The first fellowships will be awarded to three female graduate

The fund, known as the Dalia and Dan Maydan Fellowship Endowment

64. Dalia Maydan received a Ph.D. in physical chemistry from Hebrew
University in 1962.
</P>
<P>
The company headed by Dan Maydan is the world's largest producer
of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, with revenues approaching
10 billion dollars this year. It has development and manufacturing
operations in the U.S., Israel, Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Both Dan and Dalia Maydan were born and educated in Israel and
have made a major impact on the advancement of science and
technology in the world.
</P>
<P>
Since Dalia Maydan had devoted her professional life to teaching
science to young people at Hebrew University and universities in
Britain and the U.S., her husband felt that giving young people -
especially women - the opportunity to pursue their scientific
education was a meaningful way for his wife's legacy to continue in
future generations.
</P>
<P>
"It is my hope that Dalia's love of science and her zeal for
education for women will live on in each scholarships recipient,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Maydans have lived in the U.S. since 1967. Dan Maydan has
received numerous awards and honors for his contributions to the
global semiconductor industry and was recognized in 1998 as an
industry pioneer during the 50th anniversary celebration of the
semiconductor industry.
</P>
<P>
Also in that year, he received the Israel Trade Award from the
Israeli Ministry of Industry and Trade and the State of Israel
Jubilee Award in recognition of his efforts to integrate Israel
into the global economy.

<HEADLINE> Manila Still Working for Release of Hostages: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Monday that it continues to work for safe release of the remaining
Filipino hostage taken from the Malaysian resort island of Sipadan,
and 13 evangelists held by the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Robert Aventajado, chief government negotiator with
Abu Sayyaf, said in a radio interview that President Joseph
Estrada wants to make sure all the hostages are released safely,
regardless of nationality.
</P>
<P>
"We have not forgotten Filipino hostage Roland Ullah. He is
still in Patikul (on Jolo island in Sulu province), and we are
negotiating with another faction of the Abu Sayyaf holding him. We
hope to get him out in a few days," Aventajado said.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado said negotiations are taking place for the release
of evangelist Wilde Almeda and his 12 followers, who went
voluntarily to the rebels' jungle lair to pray for release of the
21 hostages abducted from Malaysia's Sipadan island in late April.
</P>
<P>
Except for Filipino Ullah who is still held captive, the other
20 Sipadan hostages, including 10 foreign tourists, have all been
freed.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado said it is likely that a "development fund" would be
given to the Abu Sayyaf in exchange for the release of Almeda and
his followers.
</P>
<P>
Aside from Ullah and Almeda's group, two French journalists are
still being held hostage by the Abu Sayyaf faction headed by
Ghalib Andang (Commander Robot).
</P>
<P>
"We are timing our move so as not to expose the hostages to any
danger," Aventajado said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the Abu Sayyaf faction headed by Robot will not
release all the hostages immediately because of fears of a
military attack.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's top two telecom
players, SingTel and StarHub, will get a total of 1.9 billion
Singapore dollars (about 1.1 billion U.S. dollars) from the
government as a compensation for the accelerated freeing-up of the
telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
SingTel will get 859 million Singapore dollars (about 499
million U.S. dollars) and StarHub 1.082 billion Singapore dollars
(about 629 million U.S. dollars), the Information Development
Authority (IDA) announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two companies have accepted the compensations, IDA said.
</P>
<P>
"Compensation is being offered in recognition of the business
and investment plans that both operators had made for duopoly-
based public telecommunications services market, prior to the
announcement of full market liberalization," IDA said.

Technology, announced early this year that the government will
accelerate the full liberalization of the telecommunications
sector by two years, from April 1, 2000 to April 1, 2002.

<HEADLINE> One More Tutsi Party Signs Burundi Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Pang Yong
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 11 (Xinhua) -- One of the four Tutsi
parties which refused to sign the peace agreement aimed at ending
Burundi's seven-year civil war last month put its signature on the
document here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a brief ceremony held at the Mwalimu Nyerere Foundation,
where the Burundi peace facilitation team is based, Godefroy
Hakizimana, chairman of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), signed
on behalf of his party the Burundi Peace and Reconciliation Accord,
which was drawn up after over two years of marathon talks.
</P>
<P>
However, three of the remaining parties from the minority Tutsi
group, namely ANADDE, RADES and PIT, who were expected to sign on
Monday together with PSD, did not appear at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Instead, they have asked to see the international facilitator
Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg, South Africa, because they would
like to have some clarifications on the agreement, said Mark
Bomani, head of the facilitation team and top aid of Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has agreed to meet with them on Wednesday, Bomani said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope after they have been given the clarification they are
seeking, they'll be able to sign. Because we have indicated before,
Wednesday is the last day for signing this document," Bomani said
before the PSD chairman put his signatures on the document.
</P>
<P>
He further explained that these documents will be delivered to
the four depositories, namely the Secretary General of the U.N.,
the Secretary General of the OAU, the National Assembly of Burundi
and the Nyerere Foundation.
</P>
<P>
"So it will not be possible for anyone to sign these documents
after Wednesday. Signing of these documents will be closed," said
Bomani.
</P>
<P>
If those who have not signed by then wish to join the process,
he said, they have to apply to the signatories, to get their
agreement to add their signatures to their agreement.
</P>
<P>
Bomani disclosed his team will convene a meeting of all
signatories on September 25 in Tanzania's northern town of Arusha,
where the signatories will talk about the implementation of the
accord.
</P>
<P>
"We'll discuss the various measures that need to be taken for
the implementations. For example, under this document, within 60
days of signing the document, the parties are invited to nominate
their representatives in the National Assembly, three
representatives each, Bomani said.
</P>
<P>
They are also expected to make nominations to the government
and will have to appoint the Implementation Monitoring Committee,
Bomani added.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi peace accord was signed in Arusha on August 28 this
year amid much confusion. Thirteen out of the 19 parties involved
in the peace talks signed with reservation, after considerable
pressure from the international community on the ensemble of
Burundi warring parties.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, mediator of the peace accord, has called on
representatives of Burundian government and the main rebel groups
to meet in Nairobi, Kenya, on September 20 to work out details yet
solved in the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Tutsis dominate the army and the economy of Hutu-majority
Burundi. Civil war broke out in 1993 upon the assassination of
the central African nation's first and only democratically elected
president Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu. Fighting since then has killed
200,000 people in the nation of roughly 6 million.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Calls for International Help Over Refugee Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone has called for
international assistance to help solve the pressing issue of
refugees being driven out from Guinea, according to reports
reaching here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone's Ambassador to Guinea Sheku Ba Saccoh was quoted
as saying in Monrovia, capital of Guinea, that the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) should adopt some emergency
measures to address the horrifying situation in the west African
country.
</P>
<P>
Saccoh said refugees from Liberia and Sierra Leone had been
thrown out of their homes in Guinea in the middle of the rainy
season and were desperate for shelter.
</P>
<P>
The rounding-up of refugees began last Saturday after a speech
by Guinean President Lansana Conte in which he accused the
displaced people of helping armed dissidents who had been
responsible for the cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about half a million refugees fled Liberia
and Sierra Leone and stormed into the neighboring Guinea during
the civil wars in the two nations.
</P>
<P>
The Guinean authorities began the crackdown on foreigners
following the president's speech in the capital Conakry and the
Guinean civilians also joined enthusiastically in hunting down the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
About 700 frightened people stormed into the Sierra Leonean
Embassy and spent the night in the embassy compound after being
driven out from homes by their landlords, or told by neighborhood
chiefs that they were no longer wanted in the area, said the
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Sierra Leoneans seem to have been the main
targets, because Liberians living in Conakry are much less
obviously foreign, being from the same tribes and speaking the
same languages as the local population.
</P>
<P>
Guinea has allegedly accusing Sierra Leone and Liberia of
supporting armed bandits in the cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> France: EU Decision on Austria to Be Announced Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's (EU)
decision on whether or not to lift sanctions against Austria will
be announced soon, said a French leading official on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This should not be delayed too long. It is a question of hours
or days," said French Delegate Minister of European Affairs Pierre
Moscovici.
</P>
<P>
The three "wise men" -- former Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari, German jurist Jochen Frowein, and former Spanish
Foreign Minister Marcelino Oreja, who were appointed by the
European Court on Human Rights to evaluate the political situation
in Austria after the entry into government by the extreme-right --
have proposed to France, the presiding EU presidency state, to
lift sanctions against Austria.
</P>
<P>
EU imposed symbolic sanctions against Austria after the extreme-
right Freedom Party led by Joerg Haider entered government in
February. The sanctions include a suspension of bilateral
cooperation between the 14 other EU countries and Austria, minimal
reception of Austrian ambassadors, and refusal to support Austrian
candidates for international posts.
</P>
<P>
Denmark has already called for a lifting of the sanctions,
while Britain expressed that it also would welcome proposals by
the three "wise men."

disclosed that 800m medal hopeful Hezekiel Sepeng will carry the
South African flag during the opening ceremony of Sydney Olympic
Games.
</P>

Neethling was even pleasantly surprised to have one local wish
him luck for the 1500m freestyle, in which he will be competing

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A Beijing software company
claims today that it has conducted a "successful experiment" in
the upgrading of the industry by linking traditional software
products with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The new software, Kingsoft.net2001, developed by Kingsoft
Company, will make its debut on the Beijing market on September 23
this year, Kingsoft's chairman Lei Jun announced here today.
</P>
<P>
He described the software as "an electronic encyclopedia",
saying that the new software will enable users to download new
words directly from the Internet "with a click of the mouse."
</P>
<P>
"Kingsoft's long-term development strategy is focused on the
Internet," he said, adding that some 12 million Internet surfers
are currently using Kingsoft2000.
</P>
<P>
The company also announced the opening of a new website, www.
iciba.net, saying that it would facilitate the downloading of
words and on-line searching.
</P>
<P>
Kingsoft.net2001 contains more than seven million expressions
and over 2000 pictures. Three versions, a Chinese, English and
Japanese, will be available on the market soon, according to Lei.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Kingsoft introduced its Kingsoft2000 version and sold
one million copies at 28 yuan each in less than three months.
</P>
<P>
Yin Zhihe, executive chairman of the Beijing Software Industry
Association, said that China's software industry is still "at a
nascent stage", with sales accounting for less than 1 percent of
the country's gross domestic product. Seventy percent of the
software products sold in the Chinese market are foreign products.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government introduced favorable policies this year
in intellectual property protection, tax reductions and in its
anti-piracy campaign to support the sector's development, he said.

<HEADLINE> HK MTR Moves Toward Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Financial Secretary of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Regional government Donald Tsang
announced Monday that the government will privatize the Mass
Transit Railway Corp. (MTR) by selling 20 percent of its stake.
</P>
<P>
The MTR Privatization Share Offer, structured as a global
offering, will be aimed at retail investors in Hong Kong and
domestic and international professional and institutional
investors, Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
The initial price range has been set at 8 to 9.38 HK dollars
per share for the initial public offering (IPO) which will open on
September 25.
</P>
<P>
To encourage small-scale investors to apply, the government
will give them a 5.25-percent discount for the IPO, with loyalty
bonus shares to be issued in the ratio of 1:20 after one year and
1:15 after two years. Individual retail investors can get a
discount of 5.25 percent for the IPO.
</P>
<P>
Tsang described the privatization of the MTR as a "milestone"
since it will benefit the economy of Hong Kong and help enhance
Hong Kong's status as an international financial center.
</P>
<P>
Privatization of the MTR will reinforce the government's
commitment to a free market and bring about further improvements
in efficiency, productivity and flexibility of the MTR, he said.
</P>
<P>
The share offer of the MTR, the first for a major public asset
in Hong Kong, also sets the precedent for possible privatization
of other public of enterprises, Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
The listing of the MTR on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will add
quality and diversity to the stock market. Besides, it would
generate considerable revenue for the government and help the
government "reduce or even avoid budget deficit," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
The MTR was set up in 1975 as an enterprise solely owned by the
government. Over the past 25 years, the MTR has developed into an
efficient and mature mass transit system.
</P>
<P>
Tsang announced in his 1999 budget speech the government's
intention to privatize the MTR.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Current Asian Depreciation Not to Trigger Another Crisis: Credit Suisse Economist (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The situation was more serious in the Philippines. The
government's inability to reduce its fiscal deficit diminished the
confidence not only among international investors, but also among
the domestic retail people. Significant domestic capital has been
seen shifting out of pesos into U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
There are also concerns of the military actions in the
Philippines, which could further hammer the investors' confidence
as well as weaken the government fiscal position.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, the government also adopted weak baht policies,
hoping that by doing this it could substantially increase exports,
which provide better earnings for farmers.
</P>
<P>
"So far, we haven't seen a significant improvement in corporate
governance, we haven't seen the banking sector being properly
restructured and we haven't seen the mentality changing so
significantly," Tao cautioned.
</P>
<P>
This does not mean that Asia can not boom again, but this
certainly sets seat for a deja vu in 20 years down the road "
Structural weakness remains unchanged while economies are quickly
moving away from crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
The currency-troubled countries in Asia still have quite a long
way to go, the economist said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia needs to generate a surplus accounting for 6 percent
of its GDP compared with the current 3 percent in deficit and it
has to do this in less than 10 years before they can get back to a
healthy fiscal stance, but 10 years of continuous efforts of this
target is extremely difficult. "This just highlights the hard task
ahead of the troubled countries," Tao emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Of course, even among the currency-troubled countries, they are
not facing exactly the same problems. For example, Thailand has a
much better fiscal position than the other two, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If there is not a substantial change in the current economic
policies, particularly the tax policies, and if the new government
can push forward the reforms of the banking sector, I do see
Thailand has a better chance to escape from the current severe
difficulties, much sooner than the other two countries," Tao
concluded.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Current Asian Depreciation Not to Trigger Another Crisis: Credit Suisse Economist (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A Credit Suisse economist
said Monday that the new round of currency depreciation in some
Southeast Asian countries will not trigger another crisis in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"The fundamentals between now and three or four years ago are
completely different," Hong Kong-based senior economist Dong Tao
noted in an interview with Xinhua. "The trends of weakened
regional currencies are all triggered by domestic political
factors and we are not seeing any major pan-regional kind of
economic fundamental weaknesses."
</P>
<P>
Compared with the situation in 1997, Tao, director and senior
regional economist of Credit Suisse First Boston (Hong Kong)
Limited, said the 1997 crisis was featured by regionally-driven,
pan-regional structural weaknesses while today's is a specific
politically-motivated currency weakness.
</P>
<P>
"We saw in 1997 tremendous over-investment, massive currency
deficit, artificial intervention by the central bank and more
underlined economic fundamentals, but for the time being, we have
not seen this kind of pan-regional structural weakness," Tao said.
</P>
<P>
And in fact, Tao noted, Southeast Asian countries, such as
Singapore and Malaysia, have recovered recently quite well, and "
this gives us the confidence: The new currency falls in the region
are more individual cases rather than a regional thing."
</P>
<P>
A recent research by Credit Suisse's analysts showed that the
currencies were quite weak but the key issue is the countries' own
main political factors and the related domestic capital outflows,
instead of pan-regional crisis.
</P>
<P>
There has been recently a significant depreciation of the
Indonesian rupiah, the Philippine peso and the Thai baht. Lately,
the rupiah saw some rebound, but in general the currency rate is
still quite low.
</P>
<P>
In April, Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid removed two of
his cabinet members, resulting in the country's political
instability and pushing Indonesia's currency close to 10,000
rupiah a U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
In early August, some stability was seen returned, but
political uncertainties still remain and the cabinet still lacks
coherence. "We do think the currency will remain quite weak in the
coming months," Tao said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Hails Resumption of Relations With Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi here on Monday praised his country's
recent resumption of diplomatic relations with Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Hailing it as a great achievement of the Iranian government,
Asefi said the resumption of the relations would definitely be in
line with the mutual interests of both countries, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that Iran's reestablishment of ties with Algeria,
after a break of seven years, could break the ground for
enhancement of ties with other North African states.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami and his Algerian counterpart
Abdelaziz Bouteflika announced on Friday that the two countries
would resume full diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial level
as of Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made in New York on the sidelines of the
United Nations millenium summit after the two leaders held "very
positive and fruitful" negotiations, Asefi said, adding that the
preparations for the resumption of ties had been made several
months ago at the request of Algerian officials.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman termed Iran and Algeria as two effective members
of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) as well as the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
The two countries play a key role in the activities of the OIC
and OPEC with their active cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also highlighted the two countries' bilateral cooperation in
international organizations such as the Group 77 and the Non-
Aligned Movement.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Algeria broke off ties in 1993 after Algiers accused
Tehran of supporting the Islamic Salvation Front, the major
opposition of the Algerian government, a charge denied by Tehran.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Decision to Increase Oil Output "Wrong": Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tareq Aziz said Monday that it is wrong for the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to make the decision to
increase oil output by a big margin.
</P>
<P>
"We think the decision is wrong and the market does not actually
need such an increase," Aziz said in a televised interview,
referring to the agreement by the OPEC oil ministerial meeting on
Sunday to increase oil production by 800,000 barrels a day starting
from October in the face of soaring prices in world market.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the decision violated the OPEC agreement stipulating
that when oil prices go over a certain figure, the OPEC will
increase production by half million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
"Our analysis of the situation is that the core of the matter is
not shortage of fuel in the market, but the taxes imposed (on fuel)
by the United States and the Western governments," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz criticized that these governments do not want to lower the
taxes, but turn to press the oil-producing countries to increase
output to lower the surging oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly declared its stance of opposing OPEC oil
production increase.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released last Thursday, Iraqi Oil Minister Amir
Muhammad Rashid said, "All facts have confirmed that the quantity
of oil is sufficient in meeting the world demand."
</P>
<P>
Iraq had been part of the OPEC quota system until the 1991 Gulf
War, triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. Its oil
output has since been monitored by the United Nations, which
imposed sweeping sanctions on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
OPEC, the world's largest oil cartel, has increased its oil
output by 2.4 million barrels a day this year.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices hit a ten-year record high of 32.85 U.S. dollars a
barrel last Monday, while benchmark Brent crude for October was
traded at a new high of 32.88 dollars last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and the European Union have been pressuring OPEC in
raising oil production to lower the oil prices.

<HEADLINE> Israel Proposes "Functional Autonomy" Over Holy Site to Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli acting Foreign
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami proposed on Monday to give the
Palestinians "functional autonomy" over the Temple Mount in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Ben-Ami said this would
give "symbolic expression" to the Palestinians desire for
sovereignty over the area, paving the way for an agreement.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that "there can not be joint sovereignty" over
the holy site.
</P>
<P>
Israel would not be prepared to give up sovereignty over
Jerusalem and the holy places to Judaism, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem issue was the main stumbling block for the two
sides to reach a peace agreement, which had been scheduled for
September.
</P>
<P>
The flashpoint of negotiations was the walled compound in
Jerusalem's Old City. Known to Jews as the Temple Mount, it is the
site of their biblical Temples. To Muslims it is Haram Al-Sharif,
or Noble Sanctuary, with two mosques marking the spot where the
Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak suggested on Sunday in New
York where he was attending the United Nations Millennium Summit
that he was willing to consider less than full Israeli sovereignty
over the site, provided it was not handed to sole Palestinian
control.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who insisted on Palestinian
sovereignty over the holy site, told U.S. President Bill Clinton in
New York last week that he would accept Islamic sovereignty there,
under the auspices of several Arab nations such as Jordan, Egypt,
Saudi Arabia and Morocco.

<HEADLINE> 29 Al-Ma'unah Members Charged in High Court in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The 29 members of the Al-
Ma'unah deviate group accused of waging war against the Yang di-
Pertuan Agong (King) were Monday charged in the High Court here.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution will show that they intended to cause the
overthrow of the Government by unlawful means, Attorney-General
Mohtar Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
He told the court that "The accused persons had through the
communication set in their possession called on military personnel
to join them in their cause."
</P>
<P>
The 29 men claimed trial when the charge was read to them again
Monday. The charge is under Section 121 of the Penal Code which
provides for the death sentence or life imprisonment if found
guilty.
</P>
<P>
The 29 men are represented by a total of 32 lawyers while the
prosecution team is led by Mohtar.
</P>
<P>
The case, conducted before Justice Zulkefli Ahmad Makinudin,
has been classified as a security case and will be conducted in
accordance with the Essential (Security Cases) Regulation 1975.
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Karpal Singh, representing Mohamad Amin, chief of the Al-
Ma'unah group in Malaysia, opposed the use of the security case
regulation, especially with regard to appeal.
</P>
<P>
However the judge did not make any ruling on the matter.
</P>
<P>
The 29 include 27 who surrendered to the security forces on
July 6 after their Bukit Jenalik base in Sauk in the northern
state of Perak was cordoned by the security forces.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Lay First Submarine Cable for Boosting Telecom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA. September 11 (Xinhua -- Bangladesh is joining the global
club of high-speed submarine and cost-effective optical fiber
cable, breaking the barrier of cross-border communication, sources
in the Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board(BTTB) said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The BTTB has signed recently a memorandum of understanding with
Tyco Submarine System Ltd. to roll out a submarine cable.
Southeastern port city Chittagong in Bangladesh and Tuas in
Singapore will be the landing points of this 3,213-kilometer
undersea cable, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Its initial capacity will be 40 gigabits-per-second(Gbps),
which could be expanded to 640 Gbps by using dense wave length
division multiplexing technology.
</P>
<P>
The cable-laying work, at a cost of 145 million U.S. dollars,
will start at the end of this year and be finished by early 2002.
A consortium of 40 carriers invested one billion dollars in this
venture.
</P>
<P>
The link will connect Bangladesh with the second Asia Pacific
Cable Network(APCN-2) to be operational from September, 2001,
which will link Japan, Korea, China, Hong Kong, the Philippines,
Malaysia and Singapore together.
</P>
<P>
Direct access to APCN-2 will relieve the BTTB and all private
telecommunication operators from struggling with the over-
congested international call traffic.
</P>
<P>
By fueling competition in the telecom market and revolutionize
the long-distance call market, the submarine cable will also
rescue the BTTB from revenue shrinkage, which is caused by high
rate of call piracy, overwhelming popularity of internet telephony
and illegal calls via leased satellite circuits, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Output Increase Not Sufficient: Indian Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- India expressed its
dissatisfaction Monday over the decision by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on Sunday to increase crude
oil production by 800,000 barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Ram Naik told All India
radio that the increase should have been around 1.1 million
barrels a day to keep oil prices under control.
</P>
<P>
"I welcome the OPEC move to increase output though I would have
been happy if the increase had been by about 1.05 million to 1.1
million barrels per day," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the announcement of OPEC decision in Vienna, Naik
said in a statement last night that he welcomed the decision but
expressed his hope that the increase, which is three percent of
the present OPEC production quota, would have "a salutary and
lasting effect on international oil prices".
</P>
<P>
Indian economy, especially aviation and land transports, were
hit hard due to the increase of oil prices in the international
markets.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether India would consider increasing oil prices in the
wake of increase in oil pool deficit, the Indian minister said the
government would consider all options including reduction in
excise and customs duty or issue of oil bonds to oil companies in
lieu of their arrears as well as mulling hike in oil prices.

NEW DELHI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Sensitive Index (Sensex)
rose on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Monday on late selling
triggered by reports of hike in prices of petroleum products by

</P>
<P>
The BSE-30 share Sensitive Index opened firm at 4,715.30 and
rose to the day's high of 4,748.81 at around mid-session. It later
reacted negatively reflecting the downslide and closed below the 4,

still showing a net gain of 28.33 points.

<P>
The BSE-100 index also improved further by 9.22 points to 2,399.
58 from the previous close of 2,390.36.
</P>
<P>
However, a statement by petroleum Minister Ram Naik that prices
of petroleum products would be hiked after Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee's return from the U.S. induced heavy selling
pressure from Foreign Institutional Investors as well as bull
liquidation.

<P>
JAKARTA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- There are still 6.9 million
illiterate people (from 10 to 44 years old) in Indonesia, an
official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Machmuri Muchlas, Director General of the Education Ministry

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Support Audit of Govt Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Most Nigerians have expressed
their support to the resolution of the House of Representatives to
audit all the financial books of the three arms of government, The
Post Express newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives last Wednesday passed a motion
mandating the Auditor-General of the Federation to probe the
financial books of all arms of government.
</P>
<P>
The motion came after the pressure on the House to subject to
self-probe in on-going anti-corruption crusade by the government.
</P>
<P>
According to a nationwide poll conducted by the newspaper, a
three-quarter of Nigerians surveyed support the motion ordering
the auditor-general to comb through the government financial books.
</P>
<P>
Those who are in favor of auditing government accounts said it
was the only way to build public trust in the governance, adding
that such development would help bring sanity and financial
discipline to the nation's public sector.
</P>
<P>
They argued that by allowing the auditor-general to scrutinize
their accounts, the three arms of government would be sending a
positive signal to the international community of the government's
determination to wipe out the corruption in the country.

ROME, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Jordan team on Monday gave up
Formula One tests at the Italian circuit of Mugello this week
because the fatal first-lap crash at the Italian Grand Prix left
without short of cars.

crash. In addition, the Italian prosecutor investigating the crash
has impounded the vehicles, along with other cars from other teams
involved in the smash-up.
</P>
<P>
Jordan was the only team forced to cancel tests for the next
championship race at Indianapolis on September 24. It had planned
to have drivers Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Jarno Trulli start
testing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Monza prosecutor Salvatore Bellomo, meanwhile, ordered an
inspection of the crash site - the Roggia corner - and an autopsy
on 33-year-old track worker Paolo Ghislimberti, who was killed by
flying debris.

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 11 (Xinhua) -- World weightlifting record
holder Halil Mutlu of Turkey said Monday night he is confident to
win the gold medal of the 56kg category at the Sydney Olympic
games.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I'm confident of taking the gold though I face some
challenges in the competition," Mutlu, gold medal winner at the
1999 world and the European championships this year, told Xinhua
after he finished his training.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old lifter snatched 140-, jerked 170- for a total
of 310-kgs in the training session this evening, all surpassing
his own current world mark -- 132.5 for the snatch, 166.5 for the
jerk and 302.5 for the total.
</P>
<P>
"My form is good. Winning the gold is my hope in Sydney. But
lifters from Bulgaria and China, and maybe some other countries,
are also very strong, I must be careful on the way for the gold,"
Mutlu added.
</P>
<P>
His performance in training well sends threatening information
to his rivals. Chinese headcoach Yang Hanxiong said that if he
could lift the weight in competitions, no one could challenge him
for the gold.
</P>
<P>
Mutlu will fight for goal on September 16, the opening of

<HEADLINE> Farmers Benefit from Ecologically-Developed Valleys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Wang Dianyou, 55, has been
plowing in fields on a hill for years in northeast China's Jilin
province. Until recently, he had no idea he could make more money
by protecting a small valley than from planting several hundred mu
of crops.
</P>
<P>
Wang lives at the foot of Mount Changbai, home to a national
nature reserve established in 1960 and well-known for its
biological diversity. Time and again Wang has cursed the landscape
of mountains and valleys for the scarcity of farmland.
</P>
<P>
But Wang turned pain into gain two years ago after he and
several other villagers began to plant edible wild herbs, ginseng,
medicinal herbs and fruit trees in the ravine in front of his
house.
</P>
<P>
With the money earned from sales of these healthful products
and foods, people living near Mount Changbai could easily make 400,
000 to 500,000 yuan (48,120 to 60,240 U.S. dollars) a year, and
also were contributing to the ecological development in the valley.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xuexi, an official in charge of the ecological protection
in Baishan, a city near Mount Changbai, said that farmers have
benefited most from the switch to farming products that are more
ecology-friendly.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide, people are choosing to protect the environment while
making effective use of resources, said Professor Meng Xianzhong
at Jilin University. The policy of sustainable development adopted
by China in 1990s has helped more farmers realize the importance
of resource protection, he said.

<HEADLINE> Assistance Promotes Tibet's Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The central government and
various provinces and municipalities throughout China have joined
hands in promoting the economic and social growth in Tibet
Autonomous Region over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the region made the remark at the second
national work conference on Aid for Tibet hosted today in this
capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province, which neighbors
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
In line with the Tibet Assistance Policy introduced at the
Third National Conference on Tibet in 1994, over 40 central
government departments and 15 provinces and municipalities have
sent some 1,268 officials and technicians to the region, according
to Guo Jinlong, deputy secretary of the Tibet regional committee
of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
In their three-year terms in the region, the officials have
played a major role in introducing new concepts and technology to
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the central government departments and provinces and
municipalities have helped launch 2,042 assistance and cooperation
projects involving total investments of 2.47 billion yuan (about
298 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In addition, they have hosted many training programs for a
number of officials and professionals from Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the region's gross domestic product reached 10.5
billion yuan, up 12.9 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Over 380,000 of the 480,000 poor people in Tibet now have
enough food. The income of the 44 welfare counties in Tibet
reported an annual increase rate of over 30 percent.

<HEADLINE> HK Entrepreneur Makes Family Planning Donation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The China Population Welfare
Foundation (CPWF) today received a one-million-yuan donation from
a Hong Kong entrepreneur who wants to be sure the country's family
planning policy continues for a long time.
</P>
<P>
He Luli, vice-chairwoman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress and chairwoman of CPWF, received the
donation from Jun-chi Chan and thanked him for his contribution to
China's family planning cause.
</P>
<P>
The chairwoman noted that China's limited state budget can not
satisfy the increasing demand of the welfare cause for the world's
largest population, and charitable donations are an important
source of income.
</P>
<P>
"After over two decades of effort, China's family planning
policy has not only gained understandings from ordinary people but
also the international community at large," she said.
</P>
<P>
She added that many Hong Kong businesspeople have shown their
concern for the welfare operation in the mainland, which has won
praise from the United Nations Population Fund.
</P>
<P>
Chan said he wanted the money to go to hard-working family
planning workers. The philanthropic businessman has contributed
some 20 million yuan (2.4 million US dollars) to various causes on
the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The family planing policy has been in effect in China for 30
years, and has helped reduce the population growth by 300 million
people.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, the CPWF-initiated Project Happy has combined the
cause with poverty elimination efforts by bringing aid to poor
families, especially those with one child. The project has spent
more than 100 million yuan (12 million US dollars) helping at
least 70,000 impoverished mothers in various parts of China. Some
30 million yuan (3.6 million US dollars) of the fund came from
donations.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Move Pleasure Grounds Out of Ancient Parks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Management staff with the
Beijing Municipal Bureau of Parks and Woods said today they plan
to move pleasure grounds out of ancient parks within three years,
leaving only a few that are small and eco-friendly.
</P>
<P>
Jing Changshun, with the bureau, said the pleasure grounds were
built in the 1980s to help the parks out of financial trouble -- a
reasonable decision at the time. But now the noise and pollution
emanating from these sites have damaged the environment and the
parks' distinctive architecture.
</P>
<P>
Jing said the plan only affects parks built before the founding
of New China in 1949, mainly imperial parks in the feudal society,
such as the Temple of Heaven, Beihai Park, the Zhongshan Park and
the Jingshan Park.
</P>
<P>
To make up for what is removed, these parks have added other
tourist attractions such as rowing and ice-skating on lakes.

<HEADLINE> Teaching Profession Favored in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- At long last, Chinese
teachers say, their profession is getting its due: education is
becoming a more popular vocation, Teachers get better pay than
ever, and society respects them.
</P>
<P>
After two decades of working on the problem, governments at all
levels have succeeded in boosting teachers' social status and
raising their pay.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the average annual income and
housing conditions for teachers is higher than average for other
professions in China.
</P>
<P>
But before 1984, teachers were widely underpaid and overworked,
and snubbed by the public.
</P>
<P>
The central government has raised the salary for teachers
several times since then, and teachers were granted a special
allowance for housing and preferential treatment for medical care
and pensions.
</P>
<P>
The governments also invested heavily in housing projects
specially for teachers.
</P>
<P>
The average living space for teachers in urban China in 1998
was 8.74 square meters, more than the average level of all urban
residents.
</P>
<P>
In most provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions,
teachers are beginning to enjoy the same treatment extended to
civil servants in terms of inexpensive medical care.
</P>
<P>
According to the Law on Teachers issued in 1993, most provinces,
municipalities, autonomous regions raised the retirement pension
for teachers.
</P>
<P>
The brain drain facing the country's primary and middle schools
has taken a turn for the better during the past few years as a
result of the governmental intervention.
</P>
<P>
Many graduates from non-teachers' colleges, for example, began
to compete with those from normal universities for teaching jobs,
a rare occurrence in China.

<HEADLINE> Special TV Program for Teachers Airs Tonight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- "Candle Night," a special TV
program to commemorate China's 16th Teachers' Day, will be
broadcast tonight by China Educational Television (CETV).
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the China Charity Federation (CCF), CETV, Phoenix
TV and Hubei TV, the program aims to highlight Chinese teachers'
contributions in nurturing the country's younger generation.
</P>
<P>
In China, teachers are compared to candles, because both share
the characteristics of self-sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
The Candle Project, initiated by CCF in 1998, is also named for
teachers and aims to lessen the burden of teachers in poor rural
schools and improve their professional qualifications.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Leader Alerts Armed Forces to Entry of Kidnappers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada ordered the country's armed forces on Monday to be on the
alert and prevent the entry into Philippine territory of a kidnap
group believed responsible for a new abduction near the Malaysian
island resort of Sipadan.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora and chief of the Military
Intelligence Service General Jose Calimlim announced the president
's directive at the presidential palace after a joint meeting of
the Mindanao Coordinating Council (MCC).
</P>
<P>
Calimlim said initial intelligence reports indicated that three
Malaysians were abducted either Sunday afternoon or early Sunday
evening on Padanan Island near Malaysia's Sipadan resort where 21
western tourists and Filipinos had been kidnapped in April.
</P>
<P>
Of the 21 Sipadan hostages taken by the Abu Sayyaf to their
jungle hideout in Jolo, Sulu, only one Filipino, Roland Ullah,
remains in captivity. The Abu Sayyaf had released the 20 original
hostages,including one Filipino.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said President Estrada issued his alert order after
receiving reports from the intelligence community on the new
abduction in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"Upon instructions of the president, we have called the
Philippine Navy. We have also gotten in touch with the Philippine
Coastguard,"Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
"We have warned the authorities in Sulu and Basilan," he added,
"that if there are any unusual movements, they should take note
and do everything to prevent these kidnap victims from being
brought into the Philippines."
</P>
<P>
Calimlim said the Philippine Air Force has also been directed
to conduct flyovers in the border between the Philippines and
Malaysia and to closely monitor movements of boats that could be
carrying the kidnap victims.
</P>
<P>
He said no details were given by Malaysian intelligence as to
the identities of the kidnappers or if they have any links with
the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
Padanan is only half-an-hour by speedboat to the Philippines'
southernmost island of Tawi-Tawi, he said.

<HEADLINE> Former Indonesian President May Refuse to Attend 2nd Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Three days ahead of the
second hearing of a case against Indonesia's former President
Soeharto, a lawyer of the defendant, Mohammad Assegaf, insisted
here Monday that his client was still not fit to appear before the
court.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Soeharto is still not in a good shape to appear in the
court.He still has a big problem in his communication skills," he
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But, he indicated that his client could be tried "in absentia"
if in fact there is a permanent obstacle hampering the former
president from attending the trial.
</P>
<P>
"But the National Supreme Court firstly should issue an
instruction or an advice stipulating such a thing. As long as
there is no instruction from the Supreme Court, the South Jakarta
District Court, which is in charge of trying Soeharto, can not
stage 'in absentia trial' against Soeharto," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The district court should give more time and wait until the
defendant is really fit to appear before the court," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Because based on the country's crime code, the sick can not be
tried," he added.
</P>
<P>
The 79-year-old man, who ran the country for more than three
decades with an iron hand, failed to attend the trial on August 31
due to his bad health condition. He was reportedly not in a good
shape at that time after a series of strokes after stepping down
from the presidential office two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto faces charges of stealing 570 million U.S. dollars
from the state by funneling money from the tax-free charity
foundations he ran into the businesses of his family and friends.
</P>
<P>
Chief judge Lalu Mariyun adjourned the hearing until September
14,during which Soeharto's medical team along with an independent
medical team of the attorney general's office, were set to explain
the real health condition of the former ruler to the judges.
</P>
<P>
President Abdurrahman Wahid has indicated that the trial
process should go on despite the absence of the former president
in the first hearing.
</P>
<P>
But so far it is not clear whether Soeharto could attend the
next trial or will keep being absent.

JOHANNESBURG, September 11 (Xinhua) -- For the next three days,
the International Olympic Committee (IOC) will meet under
president Juan Antonio Samaranch to weigh the problems of running
the biggest slice of modern global sport and they will also add by
ballot two new names to those who make up the influential
executive committee.
</P>
<P>
One of these is almost certain to be Sam Ramsamy, President of
the National Olympic Committee of South Africa (NOCSA).
</P>
<P>
It will elevate him to one of the most pretigious positions in
world sport and give him the type of power leaders of small
countries.
</P>
<P>
At the opening of Clubhouse South Africa in Darling Harbour,
Sydney, the big guns of Australian sport and politics and a more

country in only its third Olympics since shaking off the shackles
of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
"There is no saying that because they have put my name forward
I will be elected," said Ramsamy.
</P>
<P>
"Of course Sam will get elected. He led the preliminaries. Why
shouldn't he be top again?" the South African Olympic team's chef

<HEADLINE> Shuttler Drain on Rise in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian badminton
officials have been told to pay attention to the current trend of
athletes migrating to other countries and areas and carefully
consider both the negative and positive aspects of the trend.
</P>
<P>
"Countries (and areas) like Australia, Hong Kong, Japan,
Singapore and Chinese Taipei are interested in recruiting
Indonesian shuttlers," said Ciputra, patron of Jaya Raya badminton
club.
</P>
<P>
"It is good news as we can export qualified and skilled human
resources when it's difficult to find a job here. It's also an
opportunity to promote the sport in other countries," he was
quoted by the Jakarta Post Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ciputra, a construction tycoon, said it also gave coaches an
opportunity to work abroad with foreign clubs.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, we will have a shortage of players and some
of our teammates will become our opponents. We have to consider it
wisely whether athletes migrating will have a good or bad effect,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Mia Audina was naturalized after staying for eight
months in the Netherlands, where she moved with her Dutch-citizen
husband. Fung Permadi moved to Taipei more than five years ago
after failing to outperform national shuttlers. He has kept his
nationality.

<HEADLINE> China Guns for Men's Team Gold at Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Shi Ting
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The all-conquering Chinese
men's gymnasts are going all out to bring home the elusive
Olympics team's gold in Sydney next month.
</P>
<P>
China captured their fourth consecutive men's world
championship last year in Tianjin with a massive margin and now
the only missing piece of jigsaw in the picture of their world
supremacy is the Olympics title that has been dominated by the
Russians for over a decade.
</P>
<P>
China have entered the Olympics twice as team world champions
but have never won a team Olympic gold.
</P>
<P>
The nation's sports officials have set a task of up to three
Olympic gold medals for the gymnastics team, and obviously the
trophy they desire most is from the men's team event.
</P>
<P>
Believing to possess a "best ever men's team in the China's
gymnastics history", head coach Huang Yubin says he is full of
confidence to lead his men to the ultimate Olympics glory.
</P>
<P>
"We're going very well in the training and I have no doubt
China is the top favourite in the men's team event," Huang says.
While Huang is blessed with an enviable pool of young talents on
their prime time to choose from, his arch rivals Russia are
struggling to form a well-balanced effort to defend their title
with only half of the six-man team on the world level and the
other half ways behind.
</P>
<P>
Top gymnastics official Zhang Jian believes the men's team's
gold would be a safe bet. "The lads are on the peak; they're
burning with the desire to win and their spirits are soaring, " he
says. "The timing is just perfect. "It is believed China has
decided five of their six-man team, with 19-year-old vault world
champion Li Xiaopeng leading the pack which also includes pommel
horse specialist Xing Aowei and three all-around gymnasts Huang Xu,
Yang Wei and Lu Yufu.
</P>
<P>
The remaining berth in the team is to be decided between Dong
Zhen, who clinched the rings world title in hometown Tianjin last
year, and Xiao Junfeng, who hit the form earlier this year with
four vault gold medals in a row at the World Cup Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
Besides men's team's event, China are able to strike gold in
other eight events at Sydney Olympics, Zhang reveals. They're
men's all-around, vault, rings, parallel bars, pommel horse, floor
and women's uneven bars and balance beam.
</P>
<P>
The prestigious men's individual all-around title, which was
snatched by Li Xiaoshuang four years ago at Atlanta, would prove
to be a tough battlefield of no more than ten gymnasts mainly from
China, Japan, Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Romania.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese challenge in the event lie in a joint force of Xing
Aowei, Yang Wei, Huang Xu and Lu Yufu. They can expect a
formidable rivalry in the shape of Belarus veteran Ivan Ivankov
and three top Russians Alexei Nemov, Alexei Bondarenko and world
champion Nikolay Krukov.
</P>
<P>
In the men's vault event, China will depend on a tandem of
world champion Li Xiaopeng and World Cup winner Xiao Junfeng. Also,
Li is eager to repeat his gold medal-winning performance in the
parallel bars event of the 1997 worlds and is a major contender
for the floor title.
</P>
<P>
China will be looking at world silver medallist Xing Aowei for
the pommel horse gold and world champion Dong Zhen for the rings.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women's gymnasts pale in comparison with the men's,
with only two realistic chances of reaching the top podium in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Huang Mandan and Ling Jie, silver and bronze medallist at last
year's worlds respectively, will be trying to uproot Russia's
Olympic defending champion Svetlana Khorkina from the uneven bars
championship. The Russian heartthrob has never fumbled in the
event of any major competitions since the 1995 world championships.
</P>
<P>
Ling will also have a shot at the balance beam event in Sydney,
but the 18-year-old world champion will be finding Khorkina
waiting there again, alongside women's all-around world champion
Maria Olaru of Romania.
</P>
<P>
The gymnastics delegation has never returned home empty handed
since China resumed their Olympics entry in the 1984 Los Angeles
Games. Things seem to be no different this time in Sydney.

"What happened last week was a very significant development."
Michel Zen-Ruffinen, general secretary of soccer's world governing
body, told a news conference ahead of the Olympic soccer
tournament starting on Wednesday.

Although FIFA has already published a schedule for the 2002

</P>
<P>
"Of course there is a lot of work still to be done before such
a decision could ever be taken. But following the recent summit
meeting between the two Korean presidents and the very optimistic
development here last week between the IOC and the two countries,
there is still a possibility that a match or even two could be
staged in DPR Korea.
</P>
<P>
"Any match would be transferred from a venue in South Korea
rather than from Japan, of course. The issue is open," he added.

SYDNEY, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Athletes competing at the
Sydney Olympic Games could be selected to take out-of-competition
drug tests as late as the evening before their events, a leading
anti-doping official of the International Olympic Committee (IOC)
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
IOC has introduced a new test for the stamina-boosting
erythropoietin (EPO) and is also testing competitors for the first
time before their events at the Games for other drugs like
steroids.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to test the athletes on the day (of the start
of their events) but we will test athletes up to the evening prior
to the day of competition," IOC medical commission chief Patrick
Schamasch said.
</P>
<P>
Medal winners are also usually tested after their competitions
and random tests are normally carried out on other athletes who do
not finish in the top three.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen B-share Market Down at Monday Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen B-share Index
closed at 119.88 points on Monday, down 1.12 points or 0.93
percent, compared with the last close, coming off its intraday
high of 121.75.
</P>
<P>
The turnover extended to 48.98 million HK dollars, which was 0.
36 million or 0.74 percent more than Friday's total, according to
Homeway, China's leading financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen B-share market struggled and traded within a tight
range today as it lacked fresh news to encourage the buying
activity and most of investors opted to remain cautious and wait
for a clearer direction. Moreover, the market met some selling
pressure in afternoon trading as well.
</P>
<P>
Losers overwhelmingly beat gainers by 36 to 13, with seven
unchanged, Homeway analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Weifu Fuel inched up 5.65 percent to 3.55 HK dollars, while
Lionda Hold gained 4.37 percent to 1.91 HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
Hangzhou Steam went down 4.81 percent to 2.77 HK dollars, while
Huafa Elec fell 4.29 percent to 2.68 HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
Continuing Last week's trend, the Shenzhen B-share market is
likely to be in the stage of correction in the short term as
investors are still cautious to wait for the direction and the
broad rally will not come very soon, Homeway analysts predicted.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai B-share Market Up at Monday Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai B-share Index
rose 0.33 points or 0.47 percent to 70.30 points on Monday, the
second straight day it defied the psychologically important 70-
point barrier this month.
</P>
<P>
The turnover stood at 16.78 million U.S. dollars, which was 4.
28 million or 20.32 percent less than Friday's total, according to
Homeway, China's leading financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
The market posted its fourth consecutive session of rise,
providing new hints that the sentiment had been slowly emerging
from its late-August slump. The gains in shares proved not to be
temporary as a positive bias lingered on.
</P>
<P>
Breadth figures clung on the positive territory. Advancers
outpaced decliners by 29 to 17, with 9 unchanged, Homeway analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
Waigaoqiao added 6.44 percent to 0.430 U.S. dollars, ST Steel
Tube rose 5.04 percent to 0.292 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dahua Chemical fell 4.11 percent to 0.180 U.S. dollars, while
Tire &AMP; Rubber lost 3.57 percent to 0.378 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the moderate gains in the past several days will
be taken as clearer evidence that the market is gradually but
steadily moving to a rebound path. However, aggressive advances
are not very likely as most investors are currently waiting on the
sidelines, Homeway analysts said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- By the end of June, the total
assets of China's four wholly state-owned commercial banks had
reached 10.7 trillion yuan, according to statistics released today

</P>
<P>
The outstanding amount of deposits in the four banks totaled 8.

management systems in a bid to establish a modern banking system.
</P>
<P>
Among this year's list of 1,000 largest banks worldwide,
selected by Britain's "Banker" magazine based on their capital
strength, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the

<P>
He said that all these banks have successfully implemented the
reforming measures put forward in the National Work Conference on
Finance held in November 1997, including streamlining branches and
subsidiaries, practicing asset-liability management, separation of
banking business from other economic entities, and the
implementation of a new classification system for credit quality.
</P>
<P>
He said that the banks are adopting new measures to advance
various reforms and reinforce internal control, and have

<HEADLINE> Chinese Treasuries Down on Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- China's T-bond market
slackened further as the bullish stock market and news of an IPO
drained capital away from fixed-income treasuries. Declines
outnumbered advances by a dominant five to one.
</P>
<P>
The transaction value on treasuries totaled 999 million yuan,
549 million yuan less than last Friday, according to Homeway,
China's leading financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
The new floating-rate ten-year 010004, whose interest rate is 2.
87 percent this year, led the decline by plummeting 0.56 percent
to end at 103.22 yuan, driving the yield up to 2.56 percent, from
2.49 percent on last Friday.
</P>
<P>
000896 (8.56 percent, due 2006) fell by 0.15 percent to 123.16

</P>
<P>
Both 000696 (11.83 percent, due 2006) and 0009908 (3.30 percent,
due 2009) tumbled by 0.13 percent, which has been translated into
a gain of about 0.03 percentage points in their yields.
</P>
<P>
009905 (3.28 percent, due 2007) was the only gainer, by edging
up 0.02 percent to the face value 100 yuan.
</P>
<P>
China's repo market saw a tame boom with a broad pickup in the
repurchasing prices. Combined trade volume of three-day, seven-day,

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The education level of
primary and high school teachers in China has improved rapidly
over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Ministry of Education said that this is
the result of the country's redoubled efforts to reform teaching
materials and promote continuous education to improve teachers'
professional skills.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, 95.9 percent of primary teachers in
China held moderate normal school degrees and 65.9 percent of
senior high school teachers have got bachelor's degrees or higher,
compared with 47 percent and 45.9 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, the degree level of primary and high school teachers
is still far behind their counterparts in some developed countries,
where a teacher's education level is a bachelor's degree or higher.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, qualifications for primary and
junior high school teachers still need to improve.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the number of senior high school teachers or
principals with master's degree should be increased.

<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A total of 13 provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions in China have launched
institutional reforms throughout their governments, and another
four others have finished half of the job for the reform, the
weekly journal Outlook reported today.
</P>
<P>
The structural overhaul in ten other provinces and
municipalities is underway, while Jiangsu, Guizhou, and Shanxi
provinces and Xinjiang Autonomous Region are ready to start, the
journal said.
</P>
<P>
The reform is meant to strengthen some departments, such as
those in charge of the economy, finance and management. However,
redundant departments and employees in government organizations
will be eliminated or laid off.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government administrative functions of
professional economic departments including industrial and
commercial administrations will be separated and transferred to
comprehensive economic departments.
</P>
<P>
Government departments will cut the ties with economic entities
affiliated to them and will no longer interfere in the operation
and investment policies of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Through the reform, China will reduce its average number of
provincial departments from 55 to 40, a drop of about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
With a total of 74,000 employees being laid off, not counting
employees in political and legal organizations, this year's reform
will be the most extensive ever.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Wants Permanent Solution to E. Timorese Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
expected to find a permanent solution to problems arising from the
continued presence of East Timorese refugees in East Tenggara
Province, a senior official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia does not want to be blamed all the time for every
case emerging (due to the presence of) the refugees and the
militias," Coordinating Minister for Political, Social and
Security Affairs Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said after meeting with
President Abdurrahman Wahid at the Merdeka Palace.
</P>
<P>
President Wahid met with key officials including Vice President
Megawati Soekarnoputri, Yudhoyono, Defense Force chief Adm. Widodo
AS, Police chief Gen. Rusdinhardjo and Coordinating Minister for
Economic Affairs Rizal Ramli a few hours after returning Monday
morning from his trip to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Yudhoyono said that what is happening to the East Timorese
refugees at present is similar to what had happened to them while
fleeing East Timor last year.
</P>
<P>
"There must be a joint cooperation to solve the problems and
Indonesia will not put itself again in a position where it could
be blamed for anything that could happen to the refugees or the
militias," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will make proposals on how to solve the
refugees issue to the U.N. Transitional Administration in East
Timor (UNTAET) and the East Timorese Resistance Council.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, Indonesia will propose the promotion
of the existing cooperation on the border between East Timor and
East Nusa Tenggara by establishing a joint patrol and exchanging
liaison officers between Indonesia and UNTAET.
</P>
<P>
"Under the framework of the joint border committee, we will
discuss further what methodology will be used by the Indonesian
military at the border areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that Indonesia hopes this could be
implemented soon to ensure that the country could monitor and
control the activities of East Timorese refugees, militias or the
local people in the border.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the killing of three U.N. aid workers in Atambua,
East Nusa Tenggara, last Wednesday, Yudhoyono said the government
is still awaiting the report of the team formed to investigate the
incident.
</P>
<P>
The incident broke out after hundreds of pro-Jakarta militia
and refugees attacked and burned the office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees in Atambua following the murder of
former pro-integration fighter Olivio Mendoza Moruk.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Suspects in East Timor Mayhem Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Three of the 19 prospective
suspects in an alleged human rights abuse case in East Timor were
grilled on Monday at the Indonesian Attorney General's Office here.
</P>
<P>
Let. Col. Yayat Sudrajat, former commander of the Tribuana
Military Task Force in East Timor; Col. Nur Muis, former commander
of the Dily Resort Military Command; and Herman Sudiyono, former
regent of Cova Lima were questioned Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The investigators also questioned two witnesses, namely Col.
Mudjiono, former deputy chief of the Dily Resort Military Command,
and Muafi Sawidi, former deputy police chief of Dili, capital of
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
After the questioning, Yayat Sudrajat declined to comment on
the result of Monday's investigation, saying, "I have done my
duties. What I did (in East Timor) was what I had to do at that
moment."
</P>
<P>
In early September, chief of the investigation team into
serious human rights offenses in East Timor, M.A. Rachman,
announced as many as 19 civilians and military personnel as
prospective suspects in the human rights abuse case in the
breakaway province of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The rights violations took place after the territory voted in
favor of independence in August last year in a U.N.-sponsored
direct ballot.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto, who was chief of the country's armed forces at that
time, was not included in the list of suspects.

<HEADLINE> UN to Launch Reports on Asia's Sexually Abused Children in Bangkok </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Two U.N. reports on Asia's
teenage victims of sexual abuse (rape and incest) and sexual
exploitation (trafficking, prostitution and pornography) will be
formally launched here Friday, a Bangkok-based U.N. regional
agency said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the
Pacific (ESCAP) said in a statement that the two reports, which it
produced after conducting related studies in Southeast Asia and
South Asia, will reveal the grave physical and psychological
situations those abused children are facing due to inadequate
health and social care.
</P>
<P>
"We found that there were virtually few services available for
young victims of sexual abuse and sexual exploitation and, where
services existed, they only treated physical ailments, " Kim Hak-
su,executive secretary of the ESCAP, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Almost no regard was paid to the emotional and psychological
care young victims need to help them recover and reintegrate back
into the community," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The two reports also found that although legislation against
sexual abuse and sexual exploitation exists in all countries of
Southeast Asia and South Asia, great challenges remain to enforce
these laws as well as to strengthen preventative and punitive
measures against perpetrators, the ESCAP head said.
</P>
<P>
The reports are part of a wider ESCAP regional program to
eliminate sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and
youth in Asia and the Pacific. The program includes advocacy at
the governmental level, capacity building for health and social
service personnel and the development of community awareness
projects.
</P>
<P>
The ESCAP will hold a press conference to launch the reports at
the U.N. Conference Center here, which is expected to be attended
by U.N. officials, Thai politicians and experts on child sex abuse
from the Asia-Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> Japan Moves to Enlarge ASEAN Swap Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Japan has called a meeting
with the six founding members of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) and China and South Korea to discuss
bilateral swap fund arrangements, the Thai News Agency reported on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Thailand Pakornmalakul
Nayudh was quoted as saying in Brunei that if Japan's meeting with
the six ASEAN founders, including Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, as well as China and South
Korea led to smooth conclusions, the total credit line of the
expanded ASEAN swap fund arrangements would be larger.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN members agreed to increase the ASEAN Swap Fund to 1
billion U.S. dollars from 200 million dollars at a meeting of
ASEAN central bankers held in Brunei last month.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN Swap Fund is part of the Asian Monetary Fund (AMF), a
currency safety net accord reached by finance ministers of the
five ASEAN founders plus China, Japan and South Korea at the
annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank in Thailand's
northern resort province of Chiang Mai in May.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the accord, known as the Chiang Mai
Initiative, is to enable a country short of foreign reserves to
borrow from others in the agreed network to absorb and address
unjustified selling pressure on its currency by speculators
without having to devalue its currency.
</P>
<P>
Japan already has swap agreements with South Korea and Malaysia,
worth 5 billion dollars and 2.5 billion dollars respectively and
is planning to conclude a similar accord with Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The move followed a recent announcement that progress has been
seen in the AMF initiative, as finance ministers of the ASEAN
founders and their counterparts from the three key Asian economies
were actively examining technical details of a web of central bank
swap lines and repurchase agreements, aiming to unveil an initial
blueprint of the AMF by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Pakornmalakul spoke of the issue on the sidelines of a meeting
of finance ministers and central bankers of member economies of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, being held in Brunei.

<TEXT>

<P>
SYDNEY, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Sydney Olympic Games could
be opened in fine weather on Friday, weather forecasters said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meteorology Bureau spokesman Kevin O'Loughlin, giving the
first official forecast for the period covering the Opening
Ceremony for the games, meanwhile also said that Sydney's spring
weather could produce surprises.
</P>
<P>
"We rely mainly on climatology, our computer models run out
only to about seven days, so climatologically it still looks
fairly favourable," he said.
</P>
<P>
"However in September we get some rain usually one day in
three on a statistical average."
</P>
<P>
The forecast minimum temperature is 11 Celsius (51.8 degrees
Fahrenheit) in the morning, with a maximum of 21 Celsius (69.8
degrees Fahrenheit) in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
O'Loughlin said he would be surprised if there was a repeat of
the strong winds that have hit Sydney in recent days.
</P>
<P>
But he added: "We couldn't rule that out because it's spring
time and it's a changeable time."

<HEADLINE> Boeing Shows New Planes in SW China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 11 (Xinhua) -- US-based Boeing Co. today
started its three-day display of Boeing 737-700s in southwest
China, flying the new plane from Chengdu of Sichuan province to
Lhasa of Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Fred Howard, President of Boeing China, Inc. said the small
aircraft is suitable for air transport in western China, where the
climate is unpredictable and the geological conditions rugged.
</P>
<P>
Engineers started designing the new plane, with up to 149 seats,
in 1993, and put it into operation in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing air show is the fourth Boeing Co. has hosted in
China. The company displayed its Boeing 717-200 in Beijing, Wuhan,
Kunming and Xiamen last October, and the Boeing 757-300, and
Boeing 767-400 in Urumqi, Haikou, Shanghai, Beijing and Taipei in
August, stirring up enthusiasm from China's air companies.
</P>
<P>
China has become one of Boeing Co.'s main partners worldwide.
Currently 347 Boeing planes are operating in China's 17 air
companies, accounting for two-thirds of the country's airplanes in
service.
</P>
<P>
To develop the economy in the vast western region, the central
government plans to build new airports in Sichuan, Yunnan Tibet
Autonomous Region and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Boeing has predicted China will need another 1,790 airplanes in
the next two decades, costing 137 billion U.S. dollars, to grow
into one of the largest air markets in the world.
</P>
<P>
Boeing Co. has sold a total of 80 aircraft to China since 1998,
including the 184-seat Boeing 737-800 to Air China and Southwest
China Airlines.

<HEADLINE> China's Telecom Market Welcomes Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- China Satellite Communication
Group, a new Telecom developer of the country, will be put into
operation this year, plunging another competitor into the country'
s telecom market mix of ten companies.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Shaobing, who oversees comprehensive planning under the
Ministry of Information Industry, said today at the ongoing Fourth
China Fair for International Investment and Trade that this is
part of the country's efforts to accelerate the domestic economic
reform and to bring fairness, justice and order to the market.
</P>
<P>
The new company will mainly deal in satellite-related telecom
business. The State Council has already okayed setting up local
telecom administrative offices.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, a competitive system will emerge in China's
telecom market involving the five leading telecom companies of
China Telecom, China Unicom, China Mobile, China Netcom, China
Satellite and others, as well as other nine Internet operators.
</P>
<P>
Juergen D. Lagleder, senior vice-president of Siemens Ltd.
China, said China's telecom market welcomes foreign investors
before its entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO). Siemens
Ltd. China is optimistic about business expansion in China in the
near future, Lagleder said.
</P>
<P>
The telecom industry is one of the fastest-growing sectors of
China's economy, and one which the WTO has requested China open to
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
The government's long-term monopoly of the domestic telecom
industry resulted in complaints from the people and lack of
confidence in the market from foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Economists predict the telecom industry will face the greatest
impact when China enters WTO. Therefore, establishing a
competitive market now is vital for the domestic enterprises if
they are to be ready for the fierce competition from foreign
telecom companies.
</P>
<P>
China started breaking the government monopoly in the industry
in 1994 by setting up China Unicom. Now, a number of foreign
telecom equipment manufacturers such as Ericsson, Nokia and
Motorola have entered the Chinese market. But telecom service is
still closed to foreign dealers.

<HEADLINE> More Taiwanese Funds Flowing Into Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The favorable environment in
the Chinese mainland has attracted an increasing number of
Taiwanese businessmen who invested in 1,399 projects in the
mainland in the first half this year.
</P>
<P>
These projects involve a total contractual Taiwanese investment
up to 1.99 billion U.S. dollars, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The two figures represent increases of 13.65 percent and 31.29
percent, respectively, over the corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The mainland has become the biggest destination of Taiwanese
investment, accounting for more than 50 percent of the total
Taiwanese investment that has been made out of the island,
according to sources.
</P>
<P>
During the first two days of the Fourth China Fair for
International Investment and Trade, which opened in the port city
of Xiamen on September 8, a total of 238 Taiwanese-funded projects
were signed, involving a combined investment of over 950 million U.
S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
More than 4,000 Taiwanese businessmen are attending the fair,
which will conclude September 12. Many of them have commented they
are attracted by the mainland's economic strength and social
stability as well as a series of policies the mainland has adopted
to protect their interests.
</P>
<P>
As of June this year, the total of number of Taiwanese-funded
projects in the mainland had exceeded 45,300, with a total
contractual Taiwanese investment of 46.66 billion U.S. dollars,

<HEADLINE> Red Tide Near Daya Bay Disappears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The red tide that heavily
damaged marine life in waters in Daya Bay off south China's
Guangdong Province since early September disappeared today.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the State Oceanic Administration's Nanhai Branch
said, the red tide was first spotted in waters near Aotou Town in
Huizhou City on September 3, and expanded to 30 square kilometers
on September 7. It started to break up last Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to specialists with the Nanhai Branch, the red tide
was mainly caused by industrial waste water and sewage discharged
into Daya Bay.
</P>
<P>
The red tide had caused about five million yuan in economic
losses to local farmers who cultivated aquatic products in sunken
nets in the offshore areas.
</P>
<P>
Due to efforts of local departments to monitor and control red
tide development in the offshore areas, the red tide did not have
much negative impact on offshore aquaculture in the county.
</P>
<P>
Another red tide occurred in mid-August in the same sea area
causing severe economic losses to local aquatic product farmers.
</P>
<P>
However, experts with the Nanhai Branch have requested
departments concerned to study the environments affected and stay
alert to red tides in the future.

declaring statehood for at least two months, but gave the go-ahead
to launch preparations for future sovereignty, such as possibly
expanding the Palestinian Police.
</P>
<P>
Ending a two-day meeting in Gaza City, the 129-member Council
put the PLO's Executive Committee, headed by Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, in charge of setting a date to declare a state
sometime between November 15 and January 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
In New York, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's spokesman
called the move "a positive step."
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said during a tour of
Hebron Sunday that the settlers there bear more responsibility than
the city's Palestinians for the violent incidents that have erupted
in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after he was briefed by Central Command
officers, Sneh said, "To my regret, from what I've learned it is in
fact certain elements within the (Jewish) community who have
increased the number of violent acts."
</P>
<P>
He added that he wished to avoid generalizations and that he was
speaking of "a few people within the community - either they or
their children who have been educated in a certain manner."
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Senior police officers met Sunday with supporters of former
Shas party leader and interior minister Aryeh Deri, who began his
prison service for bribe-taking on September 3.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami has agreed to
a request by the Prisons Service to allow only one Knesset
(parliament) member a week to visit Deri.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Ehud Barak, addressing Jewish leaders Sunday,
declared his absolute commitment to what he pointedly called his "
civil agenda," which analysts believe will separate religion from
the state.
</P>
<P>
Barak said he could not accept the current situation in which
couples unable to marry under Orthodox Jewish decree are forced to
flee to abroad to wed.
</P>
<P>
He added that there were 1 million immigrants from the former
Soviet Union now in Israel without private cars and unable to
travel to beaches or other recreational areas because of the ban on
the public transportation system on Shabbat.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Urges Restoration of International Confidence in ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 11 (Xinhua) -- International confidence in
the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) has not yet
been restored despite the region's quick recovery from the Asian
economic crisis, Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the 21st General Assembly
of the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Organization (AIPO) here, Lee
said nagging negative perceptions about ASEAN remain as the crisis
had set back ASEAN's economic dynamism and raised doubts about its
credibility and relevance as a regional organization.
</P>
<P>
To restore confidence in ASEAN, he said, the grouping must
first convince international investors and dialogue partners with
serious adoptions of the best standards of government,
transparency, corporate governance and rule of law.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, ASEAN members must press on with cooperation
initiatives such as the ASEAN Free Trade Area and the ASEAN
Investment Area, he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, ASEAN must also help its newer members catch up and
integrate with the region and the world economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
The AIPO, founded 1977, comprises eight member countries --
Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, the
Philippines and Cambodia. The two permanent observer countries are
Brunei and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Attending the assembly are 19 countries from AIPO, its two
permanent observer countries and nine observer nations including
China.

KAMPALA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has revealed that the Cabinet is soon to table an anti-

According to a press release from the President's Office

"Once the bill becomes law, people convicted of waging war
against the state will be severely punished to serve as an example
to all enemies of democracy," Museveni was quoted as saying.
</P>

The president, who was on a fact-finding visit to Mubende
district in western Uganda Saturday over the recent rebel invasion,
said that those involved in such activities are bankrupt
politicians trying to reverse the democratization process in
Uganda.

<P>
He called on Ugandans to be on the lookout for such elements
and report them to the authorities.

<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Authorities in Jiangsu
Province, east China, has banned underground water extraction in
the areas in and around the three rapid growing cities of Suzhou,
Wuxi and Changzhou, the Guangming Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ban was issued to stop the excessive use of underground
water, which has caused serious geological problems, including
surface subsidence or sinking of land.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the ban was jointly proposed by several deputies
of the local provincial legislature.
</P>
<P>
The deputies explained that the consumption of water has
increased dramatically due to the rapid development of township
enterprises over the past few years in the Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou
industrial belt.
</P>
<P>
They said the excessive use of underground water and the
fragile geological structure in the area has caused surface
subsidence.
</P>
<P>
This area has been China's granary for hundreds of years but it
has been industrializing rapidly over the past decade.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Schools to File Lawsuit Against Education Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's private schools were
prepared to file a lawsuit against the Education Ministry for
refusing to renew the licences for 600 out of 1,130 private
schools of the kingdom, the semiofficial Jordan Times reported on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Private Schools Owners Syndicate said the ministry refused
to renew the licences for these schools on the account that they
failed to implement its directive to install computers for students
before the start of the current school semester on September 3.
</P>
<P>
The ministry had ordered all schools in the country to install
at least one computer for every 10 students by September 1, but
representatives of the syndicate met Education Minister Kliaijd
Touqan in August, who agreed to a more lenient three-year-plan for
private schools to install the computers, Jordan Times said.
</P>
<P>
Licences for private schools in Jordan are temporary and renewed
each year following inspections by officials from the education
ministry to prove if they meet the criteria set by the ministry,
and the installation of computers were added to the criteria of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's new measure was part of its campaign to eradicate
computer illiteracy among students in the kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Three Malaysians Kidnapped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Three Malaysians
reported missing from a resort at Pandanan Island near Semporna of
Sabah, East Malaysia, Sunday night were Monday confirmed kidnapped
by an armed group which staged a robbery at the resort.
</P>
<P>
"All three are Malaysians," Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, who is also home minister, said police had informed
him that the armed men might comprise foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The information is based on the Malay dialect used by members
of the group which is similar to the language spoken by people in
the southern Philippines, he said.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said police were still investigating the group
responsible for the kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
The three were reported missing after a band of four men armed
with M-16 rifles robbed Pandanan Semporna Island Resort at
Pandanan Island.
</P>
<P>
Pandanan Island is about 20 nautical miles from Semporna and
not far from Sipadan Island where the Abu Sayyaf group from the
Philippines kidnapped 21 people,including nine Malaysians, on
April 23 and held them hostage in Jolo island in the southern
Philippines for months.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the abduction was again by the Abu Sayyaf armed
group, Abdullah said police were investigating.

<HEADLINE> Manila Confirms Kidnapping of Three Malaysians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government on
Monday confirmed that three Malaysians were kidnapped Sunday by
armed men believed to be Abu Sayyaf members off an island resort
in Malaysia's Sabah state.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora made the confirmation and
said the government has ordered navy soldiers to prevent the
kidnappers from entering the Philippine waters.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Monday that after the unidentified gunmen left the
resort in a speedboat, the three Malaysians were declared missing.
They added that the attackers were heading for Philippine waters.
</P>
<P>
Reports also noted that the kidnapping at Pasir Dive Resort on
Padanan Island off Sabah late Sunday night has been confirmed by
the local Malaysian police.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf group in the southern Philippines is suspected
to be behind the abduction.
</P>
<P>
Since the kidnapping site is about one hour's ride by speedboat
from the southernmost Philippine islands, other reports said the
new hostages might have been brought into Philippine territory.
</P>
<P>
More than four months ago, Abu Sayyaf rebels kidnapped 21
people,including 10 foreign tourists, from Malaysia's Sipadan
diving resort,also off Sabah. They were then taken to Jolo island
in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Although one Filipino is still held captive, yet nearly all the
hostages have since been freed. Earlier, the Philippine
authorities warned that the Abu Sayyaf rebels, who received
millions of dollars from negotiators, might return to Malaysian
waters again.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Wheat Output Expected to Fall 60 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia National Farmers'
Union (ZNFU) has projected a decline of 60 percent in local wheat
production in the 2000/2001 farming season because of escalating
production costs and the proliferating of cheap imports, Times of
Zambia newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
ZNFU President Ajay Vashee said in an interview in Ndola,
Copperbelt Province, on Sunday the number of local wheat producers
had continued to decrease in the last three years because of the
dwindling returns on the crop.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Vashee as saying Zambia was expected to
produce less than 60,000 tons of wheat this season, a figure which
was far less than 90,000 tons the country produced in the previous
season.
</P>
<P>
He said subsidized wheat imports which had flooded Zambia
discouraged the local farmers from fully engaging in the
production of the crop.
</P>
<P>
Vashee said the local wheat corp depended largely on irrigation
and as such, the cost of power and fuel to operate the equipment,
was too high compared to other countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia's national consumption was 120,000 tons of wheat
per annum but because of the obtaining situation, it was not
possible for the farmers to meet the national demand.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Get More Funds to Fight Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is expected to get 450
million U.S. dollars from donors to ease problems arising from
drought-related revenue shortfalls, the East African weekly
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The sum, equivalent to 4 percent of Kenya's gross domestic
product, is to be released in November.
</P>
<P>
Jose Fajgenbaum, senior advisor to the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) for Africa, said the money is not targeted at any
specific area of the budget and the Kenyan government will have
the latitude to use it for "whatever priorities are deemed highest.
"
</P>
<P>
The relaxed conditions for the aid package are understood to
have been negotiated during a Washington lunch meeting last
Thursday between Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi and the IMF head
Horst Kohler, the weekly said.
</P>
<P>
Of the total sum, only 52 million dollars is coming directly
from the IMF in the form of a long-term loans at concessional
rates, pending final approval by the IMF's board meeting set for
October 18 this year.
</P>
<P>
Another portion of the package, amounting to around 160 million
dollars, will be in the form of the expected energy-related
assistance from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
An IMF mission concluded its nine-day visit to Kenya last week
for assessing additional aid necessitated by the drought in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Bicommunal Festival of Mutual Understanding Held in Cyprus Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Greek and Turkish
Cypriots Sunday night gathered at the U.N.-controlled Ledra Palace
hotel in Nicosia to attend a "festival of mutual understanding."
</P>
<P>
The festival was organized by four Greek-Cypriot and three
Turkish- Cypriot parties under the auspices of the Slovak embassy
in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The political parties and the people who have come to the
festival are sending a clear message that they want peace, Slovak
ambassador Dusan Rozbora said, expressing the hope that more such
events will be held in the future.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Agriculture Minister Costas Themistocleous, who also
attended the festival, stressed the importance of such events as
they help build trust between the two divided communities of
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"Even if a settlement is found, without trust and mutual
understanding it cannot last," he said.
</P>
<P>
Demitris Christofias, general secretary of the left-wing AKEL
party, noted that such events "aim at doing away with the division
and bringing together the two communities of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
His words were echoed by Panayiotis Demetrou, deputy president
of right-wing ruling Democratic Rally party, who also said that "
mutual understanding is important even before a settlement is
achieved and especially after."
</P>
<P>
The president of the United Democrats party and former President
of Cyprus, George Vassiliou, also turned up for the event.
</P>
<P>
According to Cyprus News Agency, General Secretary of the
Republic Turkish Party Ferdi Sabit Soyer described the event as "a
good step" and expressed the hope that more will follow.
</P>
<P>
President of the Turkish Cypriot Communal Liberation Party
Mustafa Akkinci said the festival sends the message that people
from both communities want peace.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the Mediterranean island after a failed coup in
Nicosia seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Three rounds of United Nations-sponsored proximity talks have
been held, which aimed at paving the way for substantive
negotiations to reach a settlement in Cyprus. The fourth round will
open in New York on September 12.

<HEADLINE> Australia Condemns Protesters of World Economic Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Premier Steve Bracks of
Australia's Victoria State Monday described protesters at the
World Economic Forum Summit as extremists, saying they were
responsible for the violence which occurred during the summit.
</P>
<P>
"Could I say that I condemn outright some of the protesters for
the action they have taken," he was quoted by the Australian
Associated Press as saying. "It is not Australian -- it's very un-
Australian -- and it's obviously a matter which is of enormous
regret to me as premier of Victoria and I think most decent
Australians as well."
</P>
<P>
The premier warned that the protesters would face the full
force of the law.
</P>
<P>
Peaceful protesters were being drawn in by extremists, Bracks
said.
</P>
<P>
"We will take necessary force and action to ensure the
conference continues to go ahead and people also have the right to
peaceful protest as well," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to a law approved last week by the Australian
Parliament, the armed forces could be called in to tackle civil
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Violence occurred Monday morning in Melbourne, where thousands
of protesters attempted to "shut down" the three-day World
Economic Forum's Asia Pacific Summit, which opened Monday.
</P>
<P>
The protesters claimed that the WEF is the club of the world's
rich.

<HEADLINE> Manila's Intervention Calms Down Currency Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Central Bank
Governor Rafael Buenaventura said Monday that the government's
intervention in the foreign currency market has slightly beefed up
dollar circulation in the domestic front.
</P>
<P>
Buenaventura said this in a statement issued here in a bid to
clarify reports that the central bank is not doing anything to
save the peso, the local currency.
</P>
<P>
He also contradicted earlier allegations that the central bank
had indeed released a large bulk of its reserves to contain the
further slide of the peso.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the central bank is doing its best to keep the
government's dollar reserve so as not to affect its import
requirements.
</P>
<P>
Buenaventura also dismissed reports that the peso is the only
currency that depreciated in the region, noting that all the other
regional currencies have also depreciated.
</P>
<P>
At any rate, he expressed confidence that the foreign currency
market will improve because of increased dollar remittances from
overseas Filipino workers.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine peso was traded weaker against the U.S. dollar
early Monday amid fears that the central bank would again
intervene in the currency market.
</P>
<P>
The peso averaged 45.589 against the U.S. dollar Monday, weaker
than the previous close of 45.545. Dealers said the government's
intervention is expected to create an artificial stability in the
foreign exchange rates.

<HEADLINE> World Record-holder Shi Zhiyong Quits Olympics Due to Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Olympic gold medal
hopeful Shi Zhiyong, men's world record holder in the 62-kg class,
has to withdraw from the upcoming Olympic Games because of
injuries.
</P>
<P>
"He was forced to quit the Games for a injury just several days
before we left for Sydney last week," leader of the Chinese
weightlifting team Wei Di told Xinhua on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Shi set the new world record of 152.5 kilograms in snatch at
the Asian Weightlifting Championships in May in Japan, breaking
his own mark of 147.5 kilograms created at the World Championships
November last year in Greece, where he won the gold medal for the
snatch and placed fourth for the total.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old had been considered one of the contenders for
the gold medal in his category, which will be held Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Cui Wenhua, world champion in the 1997 World Championships for
the 108-kg class, also quit the Games due to feet injury. He was
originally to take part in the 105-kg event and hope to catch a
medal for China.
</P>
<P>
"Both of the lifters suffered injuries and have to give up the
Olympics," Wei said. "It's unlucky for the two who have prepared
for a long time with hard works."

<HEADLINE> Uzbek Olympic Official Needs Banned Drug for Illness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 11 (Xinhua) -- An Uzbekistan Olympic team
official, who was detained for carrying performance-enhancing
substances at Sydney airport last week, needed the drugs for an
illness, Uzbekistan's National Olympic Committee (NOC) president
Sabirjan Ruziev said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ruziev said Sergei Voynov, 45, needed the muscle-building
human growth hormone (HGH) for a skin disorder.
</P>
<P>
Since the incident last Thursday he has gone to a Sydney
hospital with cardiac problems.
</P>
<P>
"He has been ill since 1997. He needs it," Ruziev said."When
Mr Voynov got to the customs hall, he voluntarily went up to the
customs officer and said he had this drug.
</P>
<P>
"On September 7 and 8 customs officials questioned Mr Voynov.
On Friday evening his blood pressure increased alarmingly and he
complained of chest pains."
</P>
<P>
He added in a statement: "At 10 pm on September 8 he was taken
to Concord Hospital (in Sydney) where he is at the cardiac unit
undergoing tests."
</P>
<P>
Uzbek officials said, however, that they hoped Voynov would be
able to leave hospital later on Monday.
</P>
<P>
HGH can be used to help children with stunted growth but it is
believed to be abused by some athletes who want to boost their
power.
</P>
<P>
Under Australian law the maximum punishment for carrying it
illegally into the country is a fine of 100,000 Australian dollars
(56,000 U.S. dollars) or a five-year prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
The IOC has yet to develop a test for HGH, an expensive
substance which is believed to be fashionable with cheats.
</P>
<P>
The IOC said the official's Olympic accreditation would be
withdrawn if the person was found to have smuggled illegal drugs
into Australia.
</P>
<P>
But Ruziev said: "It is important to stress that Mr Voynov was
not detained or even questioned but was allowed to proceed with
the team to the Olympic village."

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment to China Going Up (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From January to July, foreign investment in the region
accounted for more than 10 percent of the nation's total.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, China is now carrying out a strategic readjustment
of its economy, and encourages foreign businesses to participate
in the reform of state enterprises in various forms. China has
also taken a series of steps to encourage foreign investors to set
up research and development centers in China, and pour funds into
high-tech industries, which is in accordance with the global
development strategy of multinational corporations.
</P>
<P>
Gregory C. Chow, an economist from the United States held that
the decrease of foreign investment in China is only a temporary
phenomenon. "China will still be an attraction for foreign funds
in the future with the improvement of both the domestic and
overseas environment."
</P>
<P>
China has taken the lead in absorbing foreign direct investment
in developing countries for seven years in row since 1993.

<HEADLINE> More Foreign Businessmen are Speaking Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN September 11 (Xinhua) -- The number of foreign
businessmen who can speak Chinese has increased rapidly in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
And it was quite an easy thing to find a foreigner who speaks
fluent Chinese at the fourth China Fair for International
Investment and Trade, which is being held in the port city of
Xiamen, southeast China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Miss Zhang, who has attended the fair for three consecutive
years, said that at the previous fairs, the earphones for
foreigners to hear simultaneous interpretation often fell short of
demand. However, she said, this year, many foreigners do not ask
for the earphones at all.
</P>
<P>
"They want to hear the original edition of Chinese policies,"
joked Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Hong Jun Park, a representative from Hyundai of the Republic of
Korea (ROK), is one of those foreign businessmen who did not ask
for an earphone at the fair.
</P>
<P>
Hong first studied Chinese in ROK. He said in ROK, more than 5,
000 students graduate from Chinese language departments each year.
</P>
<P>
Chinese is only second to English in popularity among foreign
languages in ROK following the establishment of diplomatic
relations between ROK and China in 1992.
</P>
<P>
He thought it is more convenient if one can speak the language
of the country where he has businesses to do.
</P>
<P>
A representative from China General Electric Corp. said that GE
has more than 7,000 employees in China, and they usually speak
Chinese in the offices, adding "We attach great importance to the
localization."
</P>
<P>
Juergen D. Lagleder, senior vice-president of Siemens Ltd.,
China, said that 50 percent of his company's foreign employees can
speak Chinese.
</P>
<P>
He also wants to improve his Chinese speaking ability, and he
encourages his employees to learn Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Commentators said that speaking Chinese does not necessarily
imply that one can do good business in China. However, the fact
that more and more foreign businessmen are starting to learn
Chinese actually means that the Chinese market is attractive to
them.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that China will remain one of the biggest markets
in the world in the 21st century, since the country's economy has
made a turn for the better and its accession into the World Trade
Organization enters its final stage.
</P>
<P>
Official sources say that up to now, more than 20,000
foreigners have attended training courses to learn commercial
Chinese.

<P>
WELLINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government
has allocated 11.8 million NZ dollars (about 5 million U.S.
dollars) to help private firms carry out research and development
programs.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the government here Monday said the
new fund is called Grants for Private Sector R&AMP;D and is managed by
the New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology.
Its aim is to increase the level of private sector R&AMP;D in New
Zealand by co-funding new research projects.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to build a true knowledge society in New
Zealand and research and innovation are essential to achieving
that," New Zealand Minister for Research, Science and Technology
pete Hodgson said in the press release.
</P>
<P>
"Private sector R&AMP;D in New Zealand is only about 0.34 percent
of GDP. This is very low by international standards and we need to
substantially increase business investment in R&AMP;D here.
</P>
<P>
"Wealth today is coming more from knowledge and ideas than from
the production of commodities. This means the talent and
experience New Zealanders have applied to primary production and
processing must be applied increasingly to research and
development. We have to convert the results of our academic and
industrial research into value-added exports," he said.
</P>
<P>
The new fund complements existing support for business offered
by the Foundation. Total funds in this respect are now 36 million
NZ dollars (over 15 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Blockades Drag on to Disrupt Brussels Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Office goers encountered
Monday morning what they saw on Sunday television -- road
blockades in downtown Brussels disrupting returning traffic from
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Between 600 and 700 heavy-duty trucks refused to leave even
though their planned come-and-go drive-by protest was already
prolonged by 12 hours till three o'clock on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday protest, organized by the Union of Professional Road
Transport of Belgium, drew more than 1,700 trucks from around the
country. They were joined by tourist coaches, taxis, school buses,
inter-city buses and motorbikes.
</P>
<P>
Like their equivalents in France, Germany and Britain, the
truck drivers were protesting against the ever-rising fuel prices,
caused by both tight production quota of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the government taxation
on fuels for revenue and environment reasons.
</P>
<P>
The union met the Belgian transport ministry officials Sunday
evening but failed to agree on anything. Another meeting was
scheduled for Monday morning and no one expects there will be any
result of that meeting in which European Union (EU) finance
ministers already expressed a "no change" of their policy on
taxing fuels.
</P>
<P>
The ministers during their weekend meeting at Versaille only
demanded the OPEC to increase production so as to reduce oil
prices. The OPEC in its turn decided on Sunday to raise its daily
production by 800,000 barrels.
</P>
<P>
Fuel prices, both petrol and diesel, rose by close to 20
percent in the last three years in Belgium. A liter of petrol now
costs around 48 Belgian francs (about 1.06 U.S. dollars) while a
liter of diesel costs around 35 francs (about 77 cents).
</P>
<P>
Belgian Budget Minister Johan Vande Lanotte estimated that the
rising prices of crude oil alone cost his country 15 billion
Belgian francs (about 33.3 million dollars) more this year and
that could mean a decrease of revenue next year in the amount of
25 billion francs (about 55.5 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The rocketing of oil prices posted since early 1999 has
triggered a debate in the EU on the crude oil prices, refining and
distribution as well as taxation on oil products, the three
components of fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices now seem determined to fluctuate within a band
of 30 dollars a barrel and it entered that band in February this
year following an uninterrupted rise since December 1998 when the
crude oil price bottomed out at 10 dollars a barrel.

<HEADLINE> Thorpe Among First Batch Tested for EPO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SYDNEY, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Australian gold medal contender
Ian Thorpe was among the first of the country's athletes who were
called to be blood tested for the banned drug EPO on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Thorpe trained at the Sydney Olympic pool and then was taken
away by drug testing officials along with fellow swimmers Kieren
Perkins,Grant Hackett and Hayley Lewis.
</P>
<P>
Australian head swimming coach Don Talbot applauded the blood
testing program Monday, but joined five-time American Olympic swim
gold medalist Jenny Thompson in calling for the EPO tests to
include sprinters as well as endurance athletes.
</P>
<P>
Talbot said he was concerned some cheats may escape at the
Sydney Games if drug testing officials ignored sprinters in the
EPO testing.
</P>
<P>
"There is talk going around that bothers me a little bit ...
that EPO only helps the distance people. It's just absolute
baloney," Talbot said.
</P>
<P>
"It's across the field. It's sprinters and everybody. With
sprinters, it changes the way they've got to work and they do less
and recover quicker. The distance people, of course, they've got a
greater capacity to work. (The drug testers) shouldn't just be
focussing on the distance people which they look like they're
doing right now," he said.
</P>
<P>
The IOC has pledged between 300 and 700 EPO tests leading up
to and during the Games.
</P>
<P>
But reports Monday outlined how the test approved for Sydney
would only detect EPO use within 72 hours, rather than the one
developed by the Australian Sports Drug Laboratory which can
reveal usage within a month of an athlete taking it.
</P>
<P>
AOC president John Coates said the test was restricted to that
period to meet legal requirements.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Torch Arrives in Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
Sydney, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Olympic torch, which has
been touring Australia in the last three months, will be arriving
in Sydney, the Olympic host city later Monday.
</P>
<P>
City mayor Frank Sartor said the city is ready for the arrival
of the torch. "The city is ready and we are a great celebration
city. It will be a magical moment when the torch relay hits
central Sydney," he said.
</P>
<P>
The torch was originally lit in ancient Olympia and toured 14
Pacific island states before being brought to Australia June 8 at
Uluru (Ayers Rock) where hockey gold medallist Nova Peris Kneebone
became the first torch bearer.
</P>
<P>
Down Under, it was presented all over the country by ski,
sailing and steam boats, train and tram, solar car or simply on
foot.
</P>
<P>
It even went underwater at the Great Barrier Reef.
</P>
<P>
During the final days the torch will be at Botany Bay, where
captain James Cook landed in 1788 and on top of the Sydney Opera
House before it crosses Harbour Bridge.
</P>
<P>
While the final torch bearer will remain unknown until he or
she enters the Olympic stadium to light the cauldron for the 16-
day Games on Friday night, other famous people have already
carried it and will do so over the next days.
</P>
<P>
Swim world champion Samantha Riley will bring the torch to the
top of the opera house, golfer Greg Norman will run across Harbour
Bridge and swim legend Dawn Fraser carry it in downtown.
</P>
<P>
Others include Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli, actress Rachel
Ward,cricket captain Steve Waugh and tennis heroes John Newcombe
and Patrick Rafter.

<HEADLINE> Dong Waits for Last-minute Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Men's rings world champion
Dong Zhen, relegated to substitute in the Chinese gymnastics team
a week ago, is still training hard and hopes for a last minute
change which could salvage his Sydney Olympics dream.
</P>
<P>
"I'm full of regrets in my heart. To win an Olympic gold is
every athlete's dream, and to be taken out of the first-string
line-up just ahead of the Games is even more bitter," Dong said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Rings specialist Dong last week was replaced by all-arounder Lu
Yufu after a dramatic change of mind of the Chinese gymnastics
officials. Zhang Jian, chairman of the Chinese Gymnastics
Association, argued that Lu was a safer bet for the men's team
gold than Dong, who cannot perform at top level on four out of six
apparatus.
</P>
<P>
But Dong said he understands the decision. "In spite of all, I
think it's worthwhile to sacrifice my individual glory for the
team gold."
</P>
<P>
Theoretically, Dong still has a chance to compete in the Games
since each team doesn't have to submit its line-up until the last
24 hours.
</P>
<P>
"I will be training hard until the last minute so that I'll be
ready if the team needs me," Dong said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment to China Going Up (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Statistics show that China has
absorbed a contractual foreign investment of 27.64 billion U.S.
dollars in the January-July period, an increase of 24.04 percent
over the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign funds used during that time amounted to 18.99 billion U.
S. dollars, with the decrease rate dropping from last year's two-
digit figure to the current one-digit figure.
</P>
<P>
Contracts involving 7.1 billion U.S. dollars of foreign
investment have been signed so far at the Fourth China Fair for
International Investment and Trade since it opened in the port
city of Xiamen on September 8.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that the decrease of foreign investment in China
since the mid-1990s has been initially held back.
</P>
<P>
State Councilor Wu Yi said, "I'm very happy to see foreign
funds coming back."
</P>
<P>
Analysts pointed out, the economies in the countries and
regions which were affected by the Asian financial crisis are
recovering rapidly since the second half of last year. This has
resulted in an active effect on the inflow of foreign funds into
China, as two-thirds of the foreign investment in China have come
from 10 Asian countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the positive financial policy adopted by the
Chinese government, China's economy has increased by 8.1 percent
in the first half of the year, 0.6 percentage points higher than
that of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The fact that China's economy has made a turn for the better
greatly increased the confidence level of foreign businesses to
invest in China, said Ma Xiuhong, assistant minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation.

BANGKOK, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Residents in the northeast
provinces of Thailand are expected to brace for heavy rain and
flash floods caused by the upcoming Wukong typhoon, the
Meteorological Department warned here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Residents in the provinces of Nakhon Phanom, Roi Et, Yasothon,
Ubon Ratchathani, Surin, Si Sa Ket, Buri Ram, Lop Buri, and
Prachin Buri should be well-prepared for the new typhoon, which is
moving from the South China Sea near Vietnam towards Nakhon Phanom
province, 740 kilometers northeast of Bangkok, the Meteorological
Department said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The northeast provinces would be affected by the Wukong typhoon
first in this week, followed by other regions in the next few days,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Thai fishermen should be more careful and follow weather
conditions closely, as wind and waves in the Andaman Sea have been
strong, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The northeast provinces are still struggling to recover from
the Kaemi tropical storm, which caused some 605 million baht (14.7
million U.S. dollars) of damages weeks ago.

<HEADLINE> Japan Hopes More Golds from Olympic Judokas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Judo powers Japan is gearing
up for more gold medals from its judokas as the Millennium Games
opens on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Against the three golds pocketed in Atlanta four years ago, the
Japanese judokas arrive in Sydney in a high mood by scooping eight
of 16 golds offered at the Judo World Championships in Birmingham
last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the Japanese prefer to be in a low pitch despite the
fact that seven world titles were safely tucked under their black
belts.
</P>
<P>
"Because we did well at the world championships last year,
other countries have been aware of what we are doing," said men's
head coach Yasuhiro Yamashita, "We will aim for the gold in all
the men's and women's divisions but medals shall be scattered
among many countries."
</P>
<P>
The seven titles each for men and women will be contested over
seven days in the Olympic Games, beginning with the lightest
division on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Spearheading the Japanese challenge is Shinichi Shinohara, who
won the men's open and heavyweight titles at the Worlds and will
face the toughest challenge from defending Olympic champion David
Douillet of France who missed the Worlds due to a back injury.
</P>
<P>
Women's four-time world bantamweight champion Ryoko Tamura is
also aiming to end her Olympic jinx after twice second places in
Barcelona and Atlanta, the only two losses in eight years for the
25-year-old Japanese.
</P>
<P>
Atlanta champion Tadahiro Nomura and world champion Manolo
Poulot of Cuba will battle for the men's bantamweight title, while
Kenzo Nakamura goes all out to defend his lightweight title
against such rivals as world champion James Pedro of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Other medal hopefuls include world champion Hidehiko Yoshida
and reigning world champion Kosei Inoue.

<HEADLINE> Drugs Most Sought by Cheaters in Sport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Following is a list of main
drugs and performance-enhancing methods banned by the
International Olympic Committee:
</P>
<P>
Anabolic steroids:
</P>
<P>
Often used to boost muscles and to increase strength and power.
</P>
<P>
Side-effects for men include increased aggression, impotence
and kidney damage.
</P>
<P>
Side-effects for women include development of male features
with facial hair and deepening of the voice.
</P>
<P>
Erythropoletin (EPO):
</P>
<P>
A hormone produced by the kidneys to regulate the production of
red blood cells.
</P>
<P>
Synthetic EPO is misused by competitors to boost oxygen levels,
mostly in long-distance running, swimming and cycling.
</P>
<P>
Side-effects include the thickening the blood, death through
heart attacks and strokes.
</P>
<P>
The past 23 years recorded the deaths of some 30 cyclists.
</P>
<P>
Test to detect EPO will be used for the first time in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Blood Doping:
</P>
<P>
Some cheaters remove their own blood and re-injected shortly
before competition to increase oxygen capacity.
</P>
<P>
Useful for endurance and stamina-based sports.
</P>
<P>
Difficult to catch blood dopers, and the blood tests will not
be tested for in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Human growth hormone (HGH):
</P>
<P>
Growth hormone, produced by the pituitary gland to stimulate
the growth of bones, muscles and tissues, is used medically to
treat children whose own glands do not produce enough hormone to
allow normal growth.
</P>
<P>
Human growth hormone may be used to stimulate muscle and tissue
growth.
</P>
<P>
Side-effects include abnormal growth of the hands, feet, face
and internal organs.
</P>
<P>
Hard to detect. No test has been developed for it yet.
</P>
<P>
Stimulants:
</P>
<P>
Stimulants act on brain to increase alertness, decrease
feelings of fatigue and increase aggression.
</P>
<P>
Abuse can lead to increased blood pressure and body temperature,
increased and irregular heart beat and addiction.
</P>
<P>
Common stimulants include caffeine, cocaine and ephedrine.
</P>
<P>
Diuretics:
</P>
<P>
Often referred as masking agents, help to expel fluid from the
body.
</P>
<P>
Often used to increase the speed with which urine is produced
in order to make it more difficult to detect banned substances.
</P>
<P>
Frequently misused in sports with weight categories.

<HEADLINE> Sports May Deter Crime, Australian Study Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SYDNEY, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Sports activities may help
prevent crime, especially by young people and Aborigines in poor
or isolated areas, an Australian study tells the result.
</P>
<P>
The study report by the Australian Institute of Criminology (
AIC) said:"Crime prevention is not the primary objective of sport
and physical activity but it might be an extremely positive by-
product."
</P>
<P>
The report was based on a study of various international and
Australian sport projects, including wilderness therapy programmes
in the United States, ballet, judo and swimming in Canadian
housing projects, British football and sports carnivals in rural
Australia.
</P>
<P>
This found a link between sports involvement and crime levels.
</P>
<P>
AIC director Adam Graycar said sport provided a sense of
belonging, loyalty and support that young people, especially in
poor or isolated areas, were looking for.
</P>
<P>
"It provides opportunities for them to engage in behaviors
that are valued by society, diverting them from offending
behaviors," Graycar said in a statement.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 11 (Xinhua) -- World athletics star Maurice
Greene of the United States said upon his arrival in Sydney on
Monday that his only threat for the Olympic 100 meters gold medal
is himself.
</P>
<P>
"My biggest threat is myself, me messing up," the world's
fastest man said.
</P>
<P>
The world champion and world record holder gave the U.S.track
and field training camp in Brisbane a miss and flew to Australia
from Japan after entering one last race in Yokohama on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I believe everything has been going according to plan and I'm
just here to put on a great show," said the 26-year-old, who has
been in a class of his own for most of the season.
</P>
<P>
Greene suggested not only the title but also his own world
record were within his reach when he ran the year's fastest 100
meters in his last major outing before the Games on September 1 in
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
The way he ignored cool weather and a slight headwind to clock
9.86 seconds in the German capital suggested his record mark of 9.
79 set last year in Athens would be under threat if conditions are
right at Stadium Australia for the 100 meters final on September
23.
</P>
<P>
The double sprint world champion, whose coach John Smith has
said he has the potential to run 9.60, insisted a world record was
not on his mind.
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter," he said. "I can run 10.40. If I get the
gold medal I'll be happy."
</P>
<P>
But he could only be dreaming of emulating Canada's Donovan
Bailey, who won the Olympic crown in a world record 9.84 four
years ago in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Greene watched that race from the stands with tears in his
eyes. Then hampered by an injury, he had run poorly at the U.S.
trials and missed the Olympic team.

<HEADLINE> Bonfrere: Nigeria's Gold Chance Robbed by European Clubs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SYDNEY, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian men's soccer team
headcoach Jo Bonfrere said Monday that his team's Olympic gold
chance could be robbed by European clubs.
</P>
<P>
The Dutchman said those clubs had ignored FIFA directives
about releasing players for Olympic duty with English premier
league club Arsenal's Nwankwo Kanu the most notable absentee.
</P>
<P>
He said he had been kept waiting on players arriving late or
not at all and while uncertain about his starting line-up for
Nigeria's opener against Honduras on Wednesday, he was sure that
gold was not achievable.
</P>
<P>
"It is just not possible because of the pressure the clubs in
Europe are applying," he said. "It's impossible."
</P>
<P>
Bonfrere said the gifted Kanu was a huge loss and placed the
blame on Arsenal, which was reluctant to release him as an over-
age player, adding that the club had forced Kanu to sign a
contract which prevented him travelling to Australia for the Games.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old striker, who led his country to Olympic gold
in Atlanta four years ago, decided at the weekend to stay with the
London club rather than appear for his country.
</P>
<P>
"I love to play for my fatherland, my country, but I helped us
win the Olympic medal four years ago and because of my commitments
with my club, I decided it was not quite right to leave Arsenal
for so long and try to achieve something I had already achieved
before," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I spoke to the coach and the vice president and told them my
feelings. Now I just hope that when this is all over I can meet up
with the Nigerian national team again."
</P>
<P>
Bonfrere said another concern was over-age player Garba Lawal,
24, who plays with Dutch side Roda and will arrive in Australia
late.
</P>
<P>
"They forced him to play on Saturday, otherwise they would not
let him go. The club said it does not care about the FIFA rules,"
Bonfrere said, adding that Lawal should arrive late Monday, giving
him just 48 hours for the journey.
</P>
<P>
Under FIFA rules, nations competing in the Olympics can expect
players to arrive in camp up to six days before the start of
competition.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Honduras are in the same group as Australia and
Italy.

<HEADLINE> Stolen Olympic Flag Returned after 80 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 11 (Xinhua) -- After 80 years, the stolen
original Olympic flag was returned to the International Olympic
Committee on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The flag was stolen by Hal Prieste at the 1920 Antwerp Olympic
Games where he won a diving bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
Prieste, who climbed a 4.5-meter pole at the Antwerp Olympic
stadium for the flag, has kept it in a dusty suitcase in his New
Jersey home for eight decades.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the 103-year-old showman and jokester delivered the
flag from his wheelchair as the IOC opened its 111th Session in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
After arriving with his doctor, Prieste could not resist joking:
"Will there be a plaque with my name on it?"
</P>
<P>
He said later that he would not miss giving the flag away
because "I ain't gonna be around too long."
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Lamaina, the wife of Prieste's doctor, said he wanted
to take the flag to prove to people at home he was an Olympic
champion.
</P>
<P>
Once services in the U.S. Navy during World War I, the
California-born Prieste won the bronze in platform diving, and
went into show business after the Games as a dancer, tumbler and
pantomime artist.
</P>
<P>
His wife Hazel died 30 years ago without any children.

NEW DELHI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- India welcomed the decision
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in
Vienna to increase the crude oil production by 800,000 barrels per
day.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the announcement of the OPEC decision on Sunday,
Indian Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Ram Naik expressed his
hope that the increase, which is three percent of the present OPEC
production quota, would have "a salutary and lasting effect on
international oil prices."
</P>
<P>
However, according to a statement issued Sunday night, the
minister said New Delhi would have been happier if the increase
was of a larger magnitude considering the already very high prices
and the strong demand in the market.
</P>
<P>
Indian economy, especially aviation and land transports, was

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Atomic Energy
Authority (AEA) has implemented a radiation protection program for
the benefit of the people, an official of the organization has
said.
</P>
<P>
Preenath Dias, chairman of the AEA, said that a special team of
officials had been engaged in carrying out regular inspection of
facilities where radioactive material and machines emitting
radiation are located and used in the country.
</P>
<P>
The authority has accorded highest priority to the measurement
of exposure levels of radiation among workers to ensure the levels
are less than internationally accepted limits.
</P>
<P>
At present the AEA issues about 140 licenses per year and about
1,000 workers are screened annually by the radiation protection
service.
</P>
<P>
The authority is also organizing training courses on radiation
protection to train workers who are being exposed to radiation, on
safety procedures.
</P>
<P>
The authority also provides consultation services on how to
construct buildings where radioactive materials and equipment are
located to protect the public from undue exposure to radiation.
</P>
<P>
Dais said that the main objective of the program was to
restrict the radiation exposure of workers who are engaged in
using nuclear technology for a number of useful activities and to
protect the public and the environment from radioactive
contamination.

SYDNEY, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The ethics commission of the
International Olympic Committee said on Monday it wanted to ban
athletes from betting on their own or their rivals' performances
during the Millennium Games.
</P>
<P>
The betting was against the "fundamental ethical principles
which are at the foundation of Olympism", Keba Mbaye of Senegal,
chairman of the commission, said at the IOC Session in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"It is stated (in the rules) that to take part in the Olympic
Games you have to respect the fundamental principles and we've
said that betting on yourself or your opponents is a violation of
the fundamental principles," he said.
</P>
<P>
IOC vice-president Kevan Gosper said the IOC's executive board
had asked legal experts to insert a clause in the Olympic Charter
which would specifically ban betting and set out the sanctions an
athlete would face.
</P>

Earlier, the Australian Olympic Committee said in July that its
athletes were free to bet on themselves or rivals.

<HEADLINE> 10,000 in Berlin Participate in Holocaust Day Demonstrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 people in
Berlin held an anti-racism demonstration on "Holocaust Day" to
express their concern over recent waves of far-right attacks.
</P>
<P>
The day began on Sunday morning, when about 50 people gathered
in a park to commemorate Werner Seelenbinder, a man who sacrificed
his life fighting against the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
Many people attended other gatherings, conferences and concerts
throughout the city to show their opposition to the rise in far-
right activities.
</P>
<P>
The day reached its climax in the afternoon, when more than 10,
000 people gathered in front of town hall, where Andreas Nachama,
leader of the Jewish community in Berlin, inaugurated the day with
a speech denouncing far-rightists and neo-Nazis.
</P>
<P>
Nachama noted that certain German politicians have tried to
cover up and beautify the bitter realities far-right activities
have been surfacing.
</P>
<P>
Far-rightists have been on the rise because the government is
not firm enough and the public is weak and lacks the will to fight,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Germany's far-right National Democratic Party (NPD) said last
Thursday its membership grew more than 10 percent since the
government threatened to ban it.
</P>
<P>
NPD leader Udo Voigt last week urged far right-wingers to move
towards a single party. He also filed a law suit in attempts to
retrieve the party's bank accounts that authorities had closed in
hopes of hindering alleged neo-Nazi activities.
</P>
<P>
A rising wave of skinhead violence against foreigners since
this summer has reopened the debate over how to tackle far-
rightism and racism.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, Berlin people organize anti-Nazi activities the
second weekend of every September. The police said the
demonstration this year was the largest-ever since 1990.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Economy Changes to the Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, September 10 (Xinhua) -- In Ecuador, the U.S. dollar
completely replaced the country's 116-year-old currency, the sucre,
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On January 9, former President Jamil Mahuad Witt proposed
adopting the U.S. dollar as the country's currency to stabilize
the foreign currency market, attract foreign investment and to
save the country from an economic crisis. Over the past year,
Ecuador has experienced Latin America's highest inflation rate at
90 percent.
</P>
<P>
President Gustavo Noboa, who came to power on January 22 after
a coup, has adopted the policy and began the conversion process on
April 1, phasing in the circulation of the dollar with September 9
as the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Anyone with leftover sucre after it ceased circulation on
Sunday must exchange it for dollars in the country's central bank.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador's sucre, named after a national hero who had led the
Ecuadorian people in a fight against Spanish colonialism, began
circulation on March 22, 1884.

Taiwan's abortive bid to "participate in the United Nations"

authorities use, their attempts to create "two Chinas" or "one
China, one Taiwan" at the United Nations are futile and unpopular,
and they cannot change their failed fate.

<HEADLINE> China's On-line Family Financial Supercenter Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- China has recently launched
its on-line family financial supercenter -- www.fudao.net in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"Meaning the pass to prosperity and profitability, the net of
fudao is among the few websites in China that provide ordinary
Chinese families with comprehensive financial services according
to different individual conditions," said Guo Yichang, Chief
Executive Officer of the supercenter.
</P>
<P>
Consisting of six channels on finance, insurance, wedding
financing, real estate, consumption and education, the supercenter
features a comprehensive range of services from large transactions
to individually designed financial services, said Guo.
</P>
<P>
It introduces services from 17 commercial banks and over 50
kinds of financial products as well as a comparison of quality and
prices of more than 1,000 kinds of consumables.
</P>
<P>
Users are informed of the latest data on their stocks and
negotiable securities from the mailbox. They can also get
individual insurance plans made by experts based on their personal
situations. More than 800 insurance agents are also available on
various homepages.
</P>
<P>
The wedding financing service is unique in China, said Guo. "A
newlywed can spare several thousand yuan through series of
services including wedding loans, budgets, photographs, ceremonies
and honeymoon travels."
</P>
<P>
Services also deals with real estate, home decorating and
relevant loans and insurance.
</P>
<P>
Cooperating with 50 odd schools, the supercenter also provides
on-line education enrollment services. More than 800 subjects are
available for infants, pupils, high school students and adults.
Users can apply for educational loans, insurance and scholarships
through the website.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jin, chief operating officer of the supercenter, said that
the on-line family financing service has great potential because
the concept of Chinese people's family financing is relatively
backward, and China's financial market lacks comprehensive
analysis and in-depth information.
</P>
<P>
He added that fudao.net plans to cooperate with foreign
companies to explore the Chinese market after China's entry into
the World Trade Organization.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The following is a round-up
of China's archaeology news for the past week:
</P>
<P>
-- Ancient Coffin to Be Opened in Late September
</P>
<P>
A coffin in an ancient tomb dating back to some 2,000 years is
expected to be opened in Beijing by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists who have been excavating the tomb for eight
months will take the coffin out of the outer caskets and open it
in the Beijing Research Institute of Cultural Heritage in late
September.
</P>
<P>
The tomb, located 10 kilometers west from downtown Beijing, is
well preserved by a wooden structure, known as "ticou" in Chinese.
Ticou is a wooden tomb structure used during the Han dynasties (
206 B.C. to 220 A.D.). The wooden structure encased the tomb and
prevented moisture and earth entering the tomb.
</P>
<P>
-- Ancient Chinese Emperor Buried in Luxury
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists have found more than 5,000 graves and
over 260 pits near the tomb of Jing, the fourth emperor of the
Western Han Dynasty (206 B.C.- 24 A.D.) and his empress in
northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
These graves and pits, covering 3.5 square kilometers in area,
were found in good order and are divided into different groups
according to the identity of the buried people.
</P>
<P>
The graves and pits were constructed in the period between the
early Western Han and the mid Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220), said
Jiao Nanfeng, who led a group of archaeologists to unearth the
tomb of Emperor Jing.
</P>
<P>
-- Ancient Steles Discovered on Great Wall
</P>
<P>
Fourteen pieces of 400-year-old steles were discovered recently
on a section of the Great Wall near Shimenzhai Village, Funing
county in north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
These steles are located along a four kilometer length of the
Great Wall, which lies on Mount Qingshi at an altitude of 600
meters.
</P>
<P>
The steles are almost free from artificial damage thanks to the
steepness of the area. The legible epigraphs record the
construction history of that section of the Great Wall built
between 1607 to 1608 in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
</P>
<P>
-- Public Fete of Chinese Ancestor Staged in Tianshui
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people from home and abroad gathered in Tianshui,
northwest China's Gansu Province, attending a ceremonious fete for
Fuxi, known as one of the first legendary ancestors of the Chinese
Nation.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was held in front of the Fuxi Temple, the biggest
temple for commemorating the ancestor in China.

</P>
<P>
China will turn the existing museum in the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region into a technologically advanced one, showing
treasures found on the ancient Silk Road.
</P>
<P>
The country will pour 110 million yuan (about 13.3 million U.S.
dollars into the renovation project, which is scheduled to be
completed in 2005.
</P>
<P>
During the first phase of construction, a square, a fountain
and a garden surrounding the museum will be built, covering a
total of 9,200 square meters.
</P>
<P>
-- Beijing Renovates Catholic Church
</P>
<P>
The Chinese capital of Beijing has recently finished renovating
a Catholic church in the downtown commercial center of Wangfujing.
</P>
<P>
The St. Jausse Church, also named "Eastern Church" built in
1655 and occupying an area of 2,387 square meters, is the second
oldest Catholic church in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The local government started the renovation in May, and besides
the church itself, it also built a front square with a scope of 1.
2 hectares. Trees and grass were planted and various lighting
facilities were installed to show off the gorgeous building at
night.
</P>
<P>
-- Scholar Proves Marco Polo's Visit China
</P>
<P>
A professor with the Beijing University has claimed to have
found new evidence proving that Marco Polo (1254-1324), an Italian
traveler, did come to China.
</P>
<P>
Dang Baohai, a history professor, cited three examples from the
travel note taken by Marco Polo: a legend about the birth of a
Khan of Ouigour, an ancient nationality in northwest China;
Mongolian authorities forced to pull down ramparts built by Han
Nationality during the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368); and Kublai Khan
ordered to plant trees along roads.

<HEADLINE> Ottey Threatens to Walk out Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Fighting the IAAF to overturn
a drug test to earn her right to run in a sixth Olympic Games,
Merlene Ottey threatened on Sunday to boycott the Millennium
Olympics should she not be selected for the individual 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
Ottey, 40, was the superveteran in the women's sprinting world
with seven Olympic medals but a gold, finished fourth in the
Jamaican championships, and was only eligible for the 4x100m relay
as top three finishers of Peta Gaye-Dowdie, Beverley McDonald and
Tanya Lawrence were selected for the individual places.
</P>
<P>
Ottey said that she would give up that place if the Jamaican
Federation did not select her for the individual event, saying
that "I think I will go on vacation."
</P>
<P>
After convincing an IAAF arbitration panel that a positive drug
test for nandrolone was flawed, Ottey has returned to something
like her old form, running 10.99 and 11.00 seconds. She ran a wind-
assisted 10.91 and a legal 11.15 on the Gold Coast yesterday.
</P>
<P>
"My goal for this year was to run a personal best. It might be
good enough to get a medal, we will see," said Ottey.
</P>
<P>
She said her record during 20 years should earn her some
consideration as she has won 14 world championships and seven
Olympic medals.
</P>
<P>
"It was fourth in my trials, but they have helped other
athletes in the past," she said.
</P>
<P>
"That was the first time in 20 years of running for Jamaica
that I have finished outside the top three. They have made rules
for other athletes to prove their fitness in the past, so why
should I be treated differently?"
</P>
<P>
"I think I have proved my fitness. I am just looking for one
spot in the 100, this is what I told them."

<HEADLINE> Safin Thrashes Sampras to Win U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Marat Safin becomes the
first Russian to win the U.S. Open as the sixth seed converted a
straight-set victory over four-time champion Pete Sampras here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
After winning the U.S. Open 6-4, 6-3, 6-3, the 20-year-old
Russian kneed down to the floor and kiss the court in celebration
in Arthur Ashe Stadium as he also becomes the youngest champion
since Sampras won the first of his four U.S. Open titles a decade
ago.
</P>
<P>
This was also the first major title for Safin over a former
champion in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
"He reminded me of myself when I was 19 and came here and won
for the first time," Sampras said.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, holder of 13 Grand Slam titles, had lost only twice
before in a major final, against Stefan Edberg in the 1992 U.S.
Open and Andre Agassi in the 1995 Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
At 3-3 in the first set, Safin created his first break point at
15-40 with a sizzling forehand. Two points later, Safin rocketed
back a return winner which Sampras barely caught a glimpse of the
ball.
</P>
<P>
The second set turned at the same 3-3 juncture. After Sampras
served the first of his double-faults, Safin pounced again,
setting up the first break point of the match with a spectacular
running backhand pass, and taking the game with a solid return
that Sampras slugged long.
</P>
<P>
When Safin took a 3-0 lead in the third set, it was just a
matter of a brief time before it was all over.

JERUSALEM -- Israeli acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami
proposed on Monday to give the Palestinians "functional autonomy"
over the Temple Mount in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Ben-Ami said this would
give "symbolic expression" to the Palestinians desire for
sovereignty over the area, paving the way for an agreement.

But he stressed that "there can not be joint sovereignty" over
the holy site. (Israel-Palestine-Sovereignty)

buildings in March in the northwestern city of Khalkhal, a

A total of 52 people were tried for their involvement in the

Majlis (parliament) elections in the town.

<P>
But only 24 of them were found guilty of damaging public

JERUSALEM -- Israeli acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami
Monday welcomed the Palestinian decision to postpone the
declaration of statehood, but refused to regard it as a favor that
Israel should pay for in return.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami said he did not see any change in Palestinian National
Authority Yasser Arafat's attitude in the peace talks. Arafat wants
an agreement and "their idea to postpone the declaration means they
want to exhaust" the possibility for striking a peace deal, he told
Xinhua at a press conference in the Foreign Ministry. (Israel-FM-

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Increased Bicommunal Contacts Auspicious for Divided Cyprus by Liu Xingchang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Contacts between Greek and
Turkish Cypriots in divided Cyprus have increased noticeably in
recent months as leaders of the sides are engaged in proximity
talks for possible reunification.
</P>
<P>
Figures showed that bicommunal meetings have quadrupled since
September last year thanks to the uplift of political atmosphere in
the island country, which has been divided into Greek and Turkish
Cypriot communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and seized the
northern third of the island following a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots in 1983 proclaimed a breakaway republic, which
is recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
U.N. has been trying for decades to reunify the island by a
bicommunal, bizonal federation formula. But Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash, angered by the European Union's (EU) decision to
deny Turkey a EU candidacy, walked out of peace talks with Cypriot
government and banned almost all the bicommunal contacts.
</P>
<P>
The devastating earthquakes that hit Turkey in August and Greece
in September last year brought out detente in the two countries'
relationship. The two countries have offered aid and condolences to
each other and the "earthquake diplomacy" finally led to Greece's
drop of opposition to Ankara's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Three rounds of U.N.-brokered proximity talks between Greek and
Turkish Cypriots have been conducted since last December, and the
fourth round will start in New York Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the contacts occurred in events arranged with the help
of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) in the buffer
zone, involving individuals, groups and political parties.
</P>
<P>
A rapprochement fair at Pergamos park in the eastern part of the
island was organized by Greek Cypriot left-wing AKEL party and
Turkish Cypriot Patriotic Unity Movement earlier this year,
attracting 2,000 participants from both sides.
</P>
<P>
Party leaders of both sides also met several times this year to
exchange views on the developments of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The bicommunal activities are widely welcomed on the island,
although there are so far different views about the contacts. Some
groups and political parties believe that these contacts help build
up trust between the sides.
</P>
<P>
AKEL, active in the contacts, has expressed that although the
rapprochement efforts in themselves could not solve the Cyprus
issue, they could create a positive climate between the communities
to ensure the viability of a solution.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Urges Members to Join Free Trade Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) Monday urged its members to join the
free trade area (FTA) to be launched at the end of October.
</P>
<P>
The launching of the FTA on October 31 and the establishment
of a single market of about 350 million people will add the voice
of an integrated region to international economics and politics,
said COMESA Secretary General Erastus Mwencha while opening the
sixth meeting of the COMESA's Trade and Customs Committee here
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
"We should, therefore, put in place support programs and
arrangements for the smooth functioning of the free trade area,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
At the fifth summit of the COMESA Authority held in Mauritius
this May, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi,
Mauritius, Sudan, Uganda Zambia and Zimbabwe undertook to remove
all their remaining tariffs between each other by 31 October to
usher in a free trade area.
</P>
<P>
Since the Mauritius meeting, Seychelles has confirmed that it
will join the FTA in June next year while Rwanda and Burundi are
making good progress to join the FTA, Mwencha said.
</P>
<P>
"We need to decide on the derogation of Swaziland and Namibia.
We hope that Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and
the Comoros will join the FTA when circumstances permit," he said.
</P>
<P>
Because not all member states have undertaken to implement the
COMESA FTA on October 31, 2000, this will pose a question as how
FTA members will conduct their trade with non-FTA members, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha also tried to allay fears that the removal of tariffs
between FTA members may cause significant loss to government
revenues.
</P>
<P>
The revenues that the governments will give up as a result of
the FTA is very small and will be easily compensated for through
improved tax administration and levying of domestic sales tax such
as value added tax on the resulting larger volume of imports, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Since the FTA is one of the stages leading towards a common
market and eventually an African economic community, a formula
should be worked out on the relationship governing trade between
COMESA FTA member states and COMESA non-FTA member states, Mwencha
said.

<HEADLINE> Greece Wants to Have Good Ties With All Neighbors: Greek President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Greek President Costis
Stephanopoulos Monday night expressed the hope that Greece intends
to live peacefully with all its neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
"Greece wishes to co-exist with all its neighbors in a climate
of peace, cooperation and good neighborliness," President
Stephanopoulos said at a dinner hosted in honor of the NATO
military chiefs participating in their annual rotating convention
here.
</P>
<P>
This was also valid for Greece's neighboring country, Turkey,
with which Greece aimed to develop friendly and productive
relations, he noted.
</P>
<P>
To this effect, Greece had already proceeded since last year
in recoursing to specific friendly actions, the president said,
adding that he hoped that NATO would support the policy which
Athens had initiated.
</P>
<P>
Italian Admiral Guido Venturoni, chairman of the NATO Military
Committee, said that the good climate between Greece and Turkey
was a reality and the committee was applying efforts to aid its
continuation.
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, Greece had strained relations with its
neighbors such as Albania, Macedonia and Turkey, but Greece has
now improved its relations with the neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Since last June, Greece has done a lot to better its relations
with its long-time rival, Turkey, and the two countries have
signed a number of bilateral cooperation agreements following
several rounds of peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Studies to Raise Oil Production to 100,000 BPD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Mexico studies to raise
from 50,000 to 100,000 barrels a day (bpd) its supply of oil in
the last quarter of the year, after the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) is raising its output by 800,000
barrels a day, official sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mexico, which is not an OPEC member, has advocated in recent
years a production policy that will permit to maintain the balance
of the international market prices to prevent economic crises of
world consequences.
</P>
<P>
Mexican Energy Ministry's sources explained Monday that they
will wait for the international market reaction to the OPEC
decision, to calculate the crude for export volume to be adopted
by the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the same sources, Mexico will have an additional
producing capability of up to 200,000 barrels of oil a day, which
will permit it to take a decision on the expansion of its exports
in the following weeks.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the increase will be much smaller despite
this surplus, and that their estimations point to an increase of
50,000 to 100,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
The same sources noted that other oil producing countries could
take advantage of the OPEC decision to approve an increase in
their output.
</P>
<P>
The extra output would take Mexico's nominal export base to
over 1.8 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
Mexico is currently produces 3 million bpd of oil.

<HEADLINE> Britain Refuses to Pull Out of Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Monday refused to
bow to pressure to pull out of Sierra Leone after a dramatic
weekend raid to free British soldiers taken hostage by rebel
groups in that western African nation, saying it could even send
in reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon said no decisions had yet been
made on troop requirements in the war-ravaged former British
colony. But he added that troop numbers could be bolstered if a
threat of revenge attacks by militia there emerged.
</P>
<P>
"We constantly review our involvement in what is clearly a
dangerous environment like Sierra Leone," Hoon told BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly if that is the judgment that is reached, then the
safety and security of British forces in Sierra Leone is
absolutely paramount," he said.
</P>
<P>
The rebel militia in Sierra Leone seized 11 British soldiers on
August 25 and later freed five of them before Britain attacked
their base on Sunday morning and freed all the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The captivated British soldiers were members of a unit training
a new Sierra Leone army following a 1999 peace deal to end a civil
war which has rumbled on since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Britain's opposition Conservative party blasted the government'
s role in Sierra Leone as an "ethical mess", calling for "a
serious rethink" about military commitments there.
</P>
<P>
British newspapers also urged a fresh look at army involvement
overseas in the wake of Sunday's raid -- although the nation's
press was quick to highlight how successful Sunday's operation had
been.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on Monday welcomed a decision by the
Palestinian Central Council to postpone a declaration of statehood
for two months.
</P>
<P>
"This decision reflects a Palestinian commitment to the peace
process and their commitment to continue negotiations," Albright
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The 129-member Central Council of the Palestinian Liberation
Organization, backing down from a pledge to declare statehood no
later than September 13, decided to postpone the declaration of
statehood for two months at a meeting held in Gaza on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Albright said that the Palestinian move will give Washington
more time to work on a settlement between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to continue doing what we are doing. There are
various combinations of meetings that can take place and there are
lots of things that we will be looking at," she said.
</P>
<P>
But she noted that "there is still obviously a difficult road
ahead and we are going to be looking to the parties to make the
tough decisions that will lead to a lasting peace."

<P>
"We are prepared to continue to be of assistance as meetings go
forward," she added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Criticizes Entertainment Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton Monday criticized the entertainment industry for marketing
violent movies, music and video games to children.
</P>
<P>
"They're trying to sell their movies and other products to the
very people that they themselves say shouldn't see them," Clinton
said in an address to the Jewish Community Center in Scarsdale,
New York state.
</P>
<P>
Clinton expressed his support for a government report
criticizing the entertainment industry's market tactics and urged
Hollywood to stop targeting children with their restricted violent
products only for adults.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was released here Monday by the Federal Trade
Commission, accused the entertainment industry of aggressively
marketing violent content to children, undermining the ratings
system used by the entertainment industry to warn against the
violent contents.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that 80 percent of the movies, half of the
video games and one-quarter of the CDs are being marketed
intentionally to the very children who are prohibited from buying
them.
</P>
<P>
U.S. First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who appeared together
with President Clinton, joined her husband in calling on Hollywood
to stop its marketing practices.
</P>
<P>
She said that if elected to the U.S. Senate from New York, she
would work to implement a voluntary, uniform ratings system for
all entertainment media.
</P>
<P>
"Today, I'm calling on the industry to immediately stop
marketing adult and violent entertainment to children and
voluntarily restrict the way they advertise and market it so that
we no longer find it during prime time family hours or inside the
magazines read mostly by our kids," she said.
</P>
<P>
"It's the right thing to do, it should be done, and I hope that
the industry will act," she added.

In a statement through his spokesman, Annan called on them to
fully support the efforts of the current chairman of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS), President Konare of
Mali, to reduce tension and restore peace and security between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief voiced distress at the loss of life and injuries
sustained by innocent villagers in armed clashes along borders
between Guinea and Liberia and between Guinea and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Part of the tension stems from the flow of refugees from
Liberia and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that some half a million refugees have fled the
two countries into the neighboring Guinea during the civil wars in
Liberia and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said Guinea had begun a rounding-up of refugees
from the two countries on Saturday on the grounds that they helped
armed dissidents responsible for cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Annan appealed to Guinea to continue
extension of "hospitality" to refugees and urged the refugees to

<HEADLINE> Blair Promises Billion Pound Plan for E-Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair promised on Monday to pump one billion pounds into
delivering all government services via the Internet by 2005,
saying Britain was catching up in the global race to get online.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a high-tech business park in the English Midlands,
Blair also pledged money to help small businesses link up to the
net and said the government would soon open the first of 6,000
Internet centers in poor communities.
</P>
<P>
He promised that Britain will become the best country in the
world for e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also announced the first raft of 600 online
centers to give hi-tech access to poorer communities.
</P>
<P>
Blair said the government's initiative, called UK Online, was
aimed at ensuring the country's economy did not fall into two -
old and new.
</P>
<P>
"There is no new economy. There is one economy, all of it being
transformed by information technology," he said. "What is
happening is no dot.com fad that will come and go - it is a
profound economic revolution."
</P>
<P>
The economy was all one and what mattered was whether companies
mastered the information technology change, he told his audience
in Loughborough, central England.
</P>
<P>
The government drive had three aims: to make sure the UK was
the best place to do e-commerce, to ensure universal net access
for all and to ensure all government services were available on
the net, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The one billion pound (1.42 billion U.S. dollar) package, from
funds already allocated in Chancellor Gordon Brown's July spending
review, aims to ensure that by 2005 Britons should be able to fill
in tax forms and apply for driving licenses and new passports on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
By 2002, all companies bidding for government contracts will
have to submit their bids electronically, Blair added.
</P>
<P>
He also announced an additional 15 million pounds to provide
help and advice to companies wanting to exploit new technologies.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Government Rules Out Fuel Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Belgian Prime Minister Guy
Verhofstadt said Monday that a cut in excise tax on fuel oil was
not the right way to solve the problem of rising prices.
</P>
<P>
Belga New Agency, Belgium's national news agency, said the
prime minister was speaking in New York during a trade promotion
tour.
</P>
<P>
Belgian truckers demanding tax cuts to drive down the oil price
brought Brussels the capital to a chaos Monday, the second day of
protests by transport workers. Truck drivers vowed to continue
their blockade after storming from a meeting with Transport
Minister Isabelle Durant.
</P>
<P>
The news agency did not say what was the prime minister's
alternative to combat rising oil prices, but quoted him as saying
that the issue should be discussed at Friday's cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian protest was launched just as a six-day blockade of
French oil refineries and storage depots came to an end but
protests gathered pace in Britain and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, truckers, taxi drivers, farmers, tour
operators and others who claim that high oil prices are hurting
their businesses, continue their protests in France, the
Netherlands and Germany.

In France, protesters cleared blockades only after the
government made concessions to them. However, protests continued
in scattered French cities, despite government concessions.
</P>
<P>
A wave of protests has moved across Europe after truckers and
farming groups in France won a 15 percent cut in fuel tax
following their blockades.

<HEADLINE> British Minister Calls for Immigration Rethink </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- British Home Office Minister
Barbara Roche said on Monday that Britain should consider relaxing
immigration controls in order to attract "wealth creators" to meet
the country's skills shortages.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) on
Monday, Roche called for an honest debate on the benefits of "
managed migration" to help plug the skills gap.
</P>
<P>
She also hinted at giving skilled immigrants an option to
pledge their allegiance to the UK, and of making work permits
conditional on a suitable job offer.
</P>
<P>
Roche told the IPPR that since the early 1970s the number of
people emigrating has outstripped those entering the UK.
</P>
<P>
Britain faces a demographic time-bomb, with a quarter of the
population expected to be over the age of 65 by 2050, she said.
</P>
<P>
Other countries such as the U.S., Canada and Australia have
used immigration as an economic tool, Roche added.
</P>
<P>
She highlighted the success such policies have had in America,
where officials cite immigration as a key factor underpinning the
country's extended economic boom.
</P>
<P>
"We are in competition for the brightest and best talents. The
market for skilled labor is a global market and not necessarily a
buyers' market," the minister told the central London meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We could have a program of induction and guidance. We could
attach greater symbolic importance to the achievement of UK
citizenship," she said.
</P>
<P>
The minister acknowledged that the high number of asylum
seekers entering the UK was "unfortunate" because it had "skewed"
the debate on migration.
</P>
<P>
"I fully understand public concern about the asylum system and
about the wider threat to a properly regulated system of
immigration control," she said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Attracts Women's Votes on TV Talk Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Democratic
presidential candidate Al Gore appeared on a TV talk show Monday
in a bid to attract more women's votes in the November election.
</P>
<P>
"I know something about the job of president," Gore answered
when he was asked by the talk show host why she should vote for
him.
</P>
<P>
Gore is the first politician invited to the television stage of
Oprah Winfrey in Chicago. Gore's Republican rival George W. Bush
is scheduled to appear on September 19 on Winfrey's show, which
reaches 22 million viewers weekly.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to a new Federal Trade Commission report criticizing
Hollywood for targeting children with violent products, Gore said
they would ask the entertainment industry for a voluntary "cease-
fire" in marketing inappropriate movies, video games and music to
children.
</P>
<P>
Gore said that if elected, his administration would give
entertainment companies six months to clean up their act or face
unspecified "tougher measures" under current laws on advertising.
</P>
<P>
"What we are calling for in this case is industry self-
restraint and self-regulation, not censorship," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the entertainment industry does not change its
practice in the six months, it could be found guilty of false
advertising.
</P>
<P>
Gore's appearance on the "Oprah" TV show kicked off a week in
which Gore and running mate Joseph Lieberman hope to solidify
gains among women voters by focusing on education policy and
pledging to clean up entertainment violence marketed to children.
</P>
<P>
A recent poll showed that Gore has opened up an 18-point lead
among women, while Bush held about a 20-point lead among men.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of British Filling Stations Run Dry Amid Nation-wide Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of filling stations
in Britain have run out of key grades of petrol and diesel amid
nationwide blockades at refineries, terminals and depots and panic
buying by motorists, oil firms said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Esso, Britain's leading petrol retailer, said over 300 of its 1,
600 sites had run out of petrol and diesel.
</P>
<P>
BP Amoco, Britain's second largest retailer, said that 40
percent of its petrol stations nationwide, or 600 out of 1,500
sites, had run out of products - mostly premium unleaded and
diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
Over one-third of petrol stations run by Texaco, another fuel
company in Britain, have also run dry or are very close to doing
so.
</P>
<P>
But the British government vowed to stand its ground on Monday
in the face of the mounting protests against high fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair, anxious to avoid a repeat of chaos
in France which led to a government climbdown, told a business
meeting in Loughborough, central England, that protesters were
misdirecting their anger.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot and we will not alter government policy on petrol
through blockades and pickets. That is not the way to make policy
in Britain," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
There are a total of over 13,000 petrol retail sites in Britain,
according to the Institute of Petroleum.

<HEADLINE> Astronaut, Cosmonaut Take Successful Spacewalk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. astronaut and a
Russian cosmonaut on Monday drifted out of space shuttle Atlantis,
making a successful climb up the international space station, the
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The mission, designed to lay cable and install a boom for a
navigation unit on the exterior of the 42-meter station, lasted 6
hours and 14 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Carrying the bundled cables on their backs along with the boom
and their tools, Edward Lu of the United States and Yuri
Malenchenko of Russia ventured an astounding 33 meters from
Atlantis' cargo bay, where the space station had been anchored for
the past day.
</P>
<P>
It was the farthest distance an NASA spacewalker had ventured
while tethered.
</P>
<P>
The spacewalk official inside Mission Control, Mike Hess,
likened the foray to working on the 11th story of a 13-story
building -- with a much better view, 370 kilometers above earth.
</P>
<P>
To get to the top of the towering station, Lu and Malenchenko
first took a 12 meter ride on the shuttle robot arm. Then they
ascended hand over hand like rock climbers, clipping and
unclipping their tethers like climbing ropes as they moved up.
</P>
<P>
The work went flawlessly, ending 16 minutes ahead of schedule
even with an additional brief task.
</P>
<P>
Atlantis, launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida
last Friday, linked up with the station as the spacecraft soared
above Kazakhstan on Sunday after a two-day chase.
</P>
<P>
Astronauts and cosmonauts of the space shuttle will enter the
station Tuesday to haul in thousands of pounds of supplies for the
first residents of the complex, due in November.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Pledges to Investigate Flood Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Giuliano
Amato pledged Monday that the culprits of the flood that killed 12
people when it swept through a Calabrian campsite early Sunday
will be brought to book.
</P>
<P>
A statement released after a cabinet meeting voiced "deep
condolences" on his own and the government's behalf and gave
assurances that the "responsibilities for the disaster will be
identified."
</P>
<P>
The cabinet also declared a state of natural calamity in the
region of Calabria, where other mostly eastern areas were
devastated by torrential rain that started beating down on
Thursday after six months of almost complete drought.
</P>
<P>
The state of emergency, which will go into effect early
tomorrow, was matched by special funds totaling 30 billion lire (
about 13.5 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Twelve people were killed on the Sunday's flash flood in
Soverato, south town of region Calabria, and at least four others
were missing.
</P>
<P>
Various investigations have been opened into the disaster, by
the judiciary and the regional and city governments, to start with,
and a suit has been filed by the WWF for manslaughter and civil
damages.
</P>
<P>
One of the main mysteries is why a campsite should be
authorized with 45 percent of its area within the river bed, or
for that matter a car dealership's parking area almost fully
inside it.
</P>
<P>
Confirming that investigators have already confiscated official
documents at Soverato's town hall, the prosecutor's office said
that the charges currently being considered are multiple
manslaughter in causing a flood.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended
lower for the second consecutive session Monday as investors
worried about the corporate earnings in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 25.16 at 11,195.49
points. The blue chip index fell 39.22 points last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The technology
heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 82.06 at 3,896.35 and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 5.24 at 1,489.26.
</P>
<P>
Stocks fell after a Goldman Sachs analyst cut IBM's earnings
expectations in the third quarter. In the previous sessions, a
number of companies warned that their earnings in the third
quarter would not meet expectations. Among them were DuPont,
Campbell Soup, First Data and MPower Communications.
</P>
<P>
The fresh warning today added to traders' worries about
investment returns in the slowing U.S. economy, dragging down high-
tech companies such as Oracle, Sun Microsystems and Cisco Systems
as well as IBM.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times in the
past 15 months in an effort to cool off the economy and keep
inflation at bay. Higher rates could increase costs and lower
profits for companies.
</P>
<P>
A surge in some energy and financial services stocks did not
stop the market's falling today. Shares of Goldman Sachs rose
after the investment bank announced that it had agreed to buy the
Wall Street market maker firm Spear Leeds &AMP; Kellogg for 6.5
billion U.S. dollars in stock and cash to expand its customer base.
Shares of J.P. Morgan was also up.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 1.51 at 677.24 and the American Stock
Exchange index was up 1.58 at 969.50. But the Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies was down 2.08 at 533.26.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,541 up, 1,303 down and 531
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 895.71 million shares from 958.65
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Bush Launches Campaign in Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican
presidential candidate George W. Bush Monday launched campaign in
Florida, a state he took it for granted that he would win a few
months ago as his younger brother Jeb Bush was governor.
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to carry Florida," Bush told a campaign rally in the
state with 25 electoral votes and a large population of seniors.
</P>
<P>
Texas Governor Bush held an edge over Gore in Florida before
the two parties' conventions in August, but new private polls
conducted by both parties show the race even or Vice President Al
Gore leads now.
</P>
<P>
Bush launched his campaign in Florida with a new slogan "Real
Plans for Real People" and a fresh style, talking informally with
elderly voters and answering questions for more than 30 minutes at
a local community center.
</P>
<P>
Bush, who is spending several hundred thousand dollars for
Florida TV ads, briefly talked about his 198 billion dollars plan
to overhaul the health care system for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
The governor also met privately with several seniors who would
benefit from his plan to provide 48 billion dollars in
prescription drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
His spokeswoman Karen Hughes said that Bush would travel this
week from Florida to Missouri, Washington State, California, New
Mexico and back to Austin, Texas on Friday, visiting nine cities
en route.
