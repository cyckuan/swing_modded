<HEADLINE> Crimes Cause Huge Capital Flight From Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Foreign and local businessmen and
investors have pulled out of the Philippines a staggering 3
billion U.S. dollars in deposits since last year partly due to an
upsurge in ransom kidnappings and other major crimes, the
Philippine News Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora was quoted as saying he was
informed by Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu that the country's
dollar deposits fell by 3 billion dollars ever since it was hit in
1997 by a new wave of ransom kidnappings and other major crimes.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said President Joseph Estrada has given "No. 1 priority"
to stanching the resurgent crime wave in order to make the
country's homes and streets safe anew, and woo back investors and
businessmen spooked by the unbridled rise in kidnap-for-ransom
cases in Metro Manila and other areas.
</P>
<P>
Estrada has assumed the position of secretary of the Department
of Interior and Local Government in a concurrent capacity as a way
to dramatize his resolve to lick criminality.
</P>
<P>
The fall of dollar deposits indicated that a large number of
businessmen and investors, mostly Chinese-Filipinos, have left the
country and took their money with them, Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
That was why Estrada was "very eager" to activate the proposed
Presidential Task Force Against Organized Crime, Zamora noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the proposed task force will be in the frontline of
government efforts to neutralize kidnapping syndicates whose
rampant illegal activities have scared away investors.
</P>
<P>
According to the non-governmental Citizens Action Against
Crime, 1997 was one of the worst years for kidnapping with 152
abductions involving 249 victims, 18 of whom died in the hands of
kidnappers. A total of 306 million pesos (7.5 million U.S.
dollars) in ransom was paid.

<HEADLINE> Killing of Nepali MP a Criminal Case: Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Police said Sunday that the
killing of Nepali MP Mirza Dilshad Beg was a criminal case and
that he was indeed involved in criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Achyut Krishna Kharel told a
press conference that Beg's death was due to a dispute between two
rival groups involved in criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
Home Minister Govinda Raj Joshi Sunday told parliament that an
internal dispute between Beg's group and an Indian group led to
the his assassination.
</P>
<P>
Beg, who was a central committee member of the National
Democratic Party (RPP), was gunned down here on the night of June
29 along with his driver.
</P>
<P>
Press reports here said he was wanted in India on a number of
criminal charges. Weeks before his death, the Indian government
had sought his extradition.
</P>
<P>
Rajendra Sadashiv Nikhale alias Chhota Rajan, an Indian
underworld don, had claimed that he gave the order to kill Beg.
</P>
<P>
"He was the conduit for the ISI. He was the main person
supplying weapons and explosives... He was also a close contact of
Dawood Ibrahim's and any one who aligns with Dawood is my enemy,"
he said in an interview with the Indian news magazine India Today.
</P>
<P>
The ISI stands for Pakistani intelligence agency while Dawood
Ibrahim, an underworld don living in Dubai, is Rajan's
friend-turned-foe.
</P>
<P>
"Through the ISI, he (Beg) was spreading terror in India," he
said. "With Beg out of the scene, it will not be easy for Dawood
to operate from Nepal."
</P>
<P>
Rajan, 39, controls much of the criminal underworld in Bombay
from his hideout in Malaysia, press reports here said.
</P>
<P>
Home Minister Joshi said Rajan, O.P. Singh and Bablu Srivastav
of India and Safiq Mohammad Khan of Nepal had been found to have
ordered and planned the assassination of Beg.
</P>
<P>
He said Khan enjoyed a very close relationship with Beg, which,
however, later turned into a bitter enmity.
</P>
<P>
He said a massive search for other accomplices is under way and
a circular has been issued through the Interpol -- the
International Criminal Police Organization.
</P>
<P>
IGP's Kharel said that five suspects including a police
constable had been arrested and the police will file the case to
the court within 25 days.
</P>
<P>
He said those arrested are all Nepalese and one of them was
brought to Nepal from India with the help of the Interpol.

MOSCOW, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia and South Korea might
normalize their damaged relations only after the visit by Russian
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov to Manila at the end of July,
Russian diplomatic sources said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency reported that South Korea has proposed
that the Russian and South Korean foreign ministers meet in Manila

the situation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Russian side is studying the proposal, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Russia and South Korea deteriorated at the
beginning of July when Moscow expelled a South Korean councillor,
who allegedly had conducted unlawful activities, and South Korea
retaliated by expelling a Russian diplomat from Seoul.
</P>
<P>
It was said that Moscow is to decide whether it is expedient to
meet South Korea halfway, or wait a little longer.

<P>
TEL AVIV, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Senior Israeli and Palestinian
officials resumed direct talks here Sunday in an effort to break
the impasse on the overdue Israeli redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai shook hands with
Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), deputy head of the Palestinian National
Authority, before their meeting at the Dan Hotel near the Tel Aviv
beach.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the first high-level Israeli-Palestinian direct
meeting in months, was convened at the request of the United
States. The two sides sought to break the 16-month-old deadlock in
the peace process stalled since March last year when Israel began
building a Jewish settlement in the disputed Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli delegation also included Cabinet Secretary Danny
Naveh and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's attorney Yitzhak
Molcho. Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat was among the
Palestinian team.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda was the implementation of the U.S. proposal
calling for a 13.1 percent Israeli withdrawal in the second
stage of Israeli further redeployments in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports speculated that Mordechai would propose
setting up joint committees to discuss the redeployment issue,
demand annulling the Palestinian Covenant articles calling for
Israel's destruction, and press the Palestinian on security issues.
</P>
<P>
The committees would conclude their works within a week.
</P>
<P>
Israel has so far rejected the U.S. proposal citing security
concerns. But Palestinian officials have stressed that the
Palestinian team came to the meeting only to listen because they
insisted the U.S. proposal should never be renegotiated.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's talks were overshadowed by a failed car bombing
attempt in central Jerusalem allegedly launched by the militant
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas). A suspected Hamas member was
arrested by Israeli police after suffering serious burns in
preparing for the attack. No one else was hurt.
</P>
<P>
Israel is expected to use the incident to press the Palestinian
side to do more on cracking down on terrorism.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Criticizes U.S. Over Oil Pricing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has criticized a U.S. move to
delay the approval of Iraq's oil pricing mechanism, calling it
"an unprecedented violation of adopted procedures for the
oil-for-food deal," the Iraqi News Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted an unnamed Oil Ministry spokesman as saying
that "this stand of U.S. administration is a flagrant violation of
adopted procedures as has never happened since the start of the
Memorandum of Understanding" that launched the oil-for-food
program in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. action also disrupted Iraq's oil exports plan, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the U.S. representative to the U.N. Sanctions
Committee opposed Iraq's selling price for August on grounds that
exports to Europe were underpriced. He demanded the discussion on the
pricing formula be postponed till July 24.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's State Oil Marketing Organization proposed a price of 2.6
U.S. dollars a barrel below Brent crude for the Kirkuk crude
destined for the European market in August.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has typically sold its oil at an average of 1.5 dollars
below the North Sea benchmark.
</P>
<P>
Iraq charged that by chosing the date, the U.S. representative
intended to continue delaying the approval of the pricing
mechanism until July 25 and 26 which are the U.N.' weekend.
</P>
<P>
"Consequently, reconsideration of the pricing mechanism will be
delayed until July 28, a matter that will cause confusion in oil
tankers' timetable," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the action once again "confirms that the
U.S. administration harbors ill intentions" against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Such U.S. policy aims to harm the people of Iraq and deprive
them of their legitimate needs" for foodstuffs and medicine,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was initially allowed to sell 2 billion dollars worth of
oil every six months to buy food and medicine under the
oil-for-food deal. And the ceiling was raised to 5.2 billion
dollars in the fourth phase of the deal starting on June 3.

<HEADLINE> 3rdadd: Israeli, Palestinian Officials Resume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEL AVIV, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The direct Israeli-Palestinian
talks were resumed here Sunday as Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai sat down with top Palestinian official Mahmoud Abbas
(Abu Mazen) to discuss reviving the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai shook hands with Mazen, deputy head of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA), before entering their
meeting at the the Dan Hotel near the Tel Aviv beach.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the first between the two sides in months, was
held at the request of the United States, which urged intensified
efforts to rescue the moribund peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two sides sought to settle some contentious issues blocking
the progress in the peace process that has stalled for 16 months
since March last year when Israel began building a Jewish
settlement in the disputed Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Among the Israeli delegation also included Cabinet Secretary
Danny Naveh and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's attorney
Yitzhak Molcho. Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat was
among the Palestinian team.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda of the Mordechai-Mazen meeting was the
U.S. proposal calling for a 13.1 percent Israeli withdrawal in the
second stage of Israeli further redeployments in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
More talks are expected as the two sides try to clinch a deal
on the second Israeli redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports speculated that Mordechai would suggest
setting up joint committees to discuss the redeployment, demand
annulling the Palestinian Covenant articles calling for Israel's
destruction, and press on the Palestinian side on security issues.
</P>
<P>
The committees would conclude their works within a week.
</P>
<P>
On the second redeployment, it was widely reported that Israel
would try to persuade the Palestinians to accepted its idea on
so-called Area D among the 13.1 percent withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
In this area, Israeli troops retain the right to reenter to
arrest suspected terrorists, and the Palestinian residents there
would not be allowed to build without permission.
</P>
<P>
But Palestinian officials have stressed that Israel should
return the proposed 13.1 percent of West Bank be turned into Area
A, which is under complete PNA control.
</P>
<P>
Despite the PNA's endorsement of the U.S. plan, Israel has so
far rejected the idea citing that any withdrawal exceeding 9
percent would endanger Israeli security interests. The
Palestinians insisted that the 13.1 percent proposal should not
be renegotiated.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of the talks, Palestinian officials downplayed any
dramatic breakthrough from the talks. Palestinian Planning and
International Cooperation Minister Nabil Shaath said the chance
of success was "very limited."
</P>
<P>
He tressed that the Palestinian team would tell the Israelis
that they would not back down even an inch from the
U.S. initiative, which he described as the PNA's minimal demand.
</P>
<P>
If the Israelis did not accept the US initiative, he warned,
then the PNA would ask the U.S. to take the next step.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's talks were also overshadowed by a failed car bombing
attempt in central Jerusalem allegedly launched by the
anti-Israeli militant Islamic Resistance Movement, or Hamas. A
Hamas suspect was arrested by Israeli police after suffering burns
in preparing for the attack. No one else was hurt.
</P>
<P>
Israel is expected to use the incident to press the Palestinian
side to do more to fight terrorism.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has signed an agreement with the Kilimanjaro Airports Development
Company Limited (KADCO) in a move to privatize the Kilimanjaro
International Airport (KIA).
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Sunday in Dar es Salaam by Salum Msoma, the
permanent secretary in the Ministry of Transport and
Communication, said KIA will be the first international airport
to be privatized in east and south Africa.
</P>
<P>
The statement said under the agreement, KADCO will lease and
operate the international airport for the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
"This demonstrates the commitment of the government to work
with international investors to improve the quality of the
national infrastructure," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The permanent secretary said in the statement that it is
expected that a modern and vibrant international airport in
Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa, will underpin the
development of tourism in the northern circuit.
</P>
<P>
The statement said KADCO's immediate role after acquiring the
airport is to act as a primary development company, adding that
various aspects of the airport's operations will be contracted to
the third parties with proven experience.
</P>
<P>
The statement also noted that the government will entrust the
existing assets to KADCO in exchange for a minority share holding
in KADCO.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Asked to Promote Israeli-Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu Sunday called on Jordan to help promote the
understanding between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the remarks when he met visiting Jordanian
Foreign Minister Jawad Anani, said a statement issued by the Prime
Minister's Office after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli leader assured Anani that he was determined to advance
the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations in order to finalize an
arrangement. He hoped Jordan would help achieve an understanding
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed Jordan could play a positive role this time
just as it did in helping reach the Israeli-Palestinian Hebron
Agreement in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, the second Arab country to seal peace with Israel after
Egypt, has been maintaining warm ties with Israel despite the
stalemate in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Anani expressed Jordan's desire for progress toward achieving
an Israeli-Palestinian agreement over the long overdue Israeli
redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The statement did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came just hours before the direct talks between
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and senior Palestinian
official Abu Mazen in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The talks were called upon by the U.S. in an attempt to break
the 16-month-old deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Anani met with Palestinian National Authority President
Yasser Arafat Saturday in Ramallah. Israel Radio reported that
they discussed the Palestinian-Jordanian cooperation, especially
on advancing the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.

<HEADLINE> Iran, EU Voice Readiness for Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran and the European Union (EU)
Sunday expressed readiness to promote multi-faceted cooperation
despite their differences over some issues.
</P>
<P>
"Although some differences exist, we are working to explore
grounds for EU-Iran cooperation in various areas, especially
economic cooperation," head of EU's Troika delegation Albert
Rohan told Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi in a meeting.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi agreed with the EU official on Iran-EU cooperation,
saying the two sides would cooperate on pursuing disarmament. He
added Iran is working with international organizations on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
The economic area is another field for cooperation between the
two sides, he added.
</P>
<P>
Rohan, secretary general of the Austrian Foreign Ministry, said
the EU-Iran talks on Saturday and Sunday were cordial and the two
sides had exchanged their views on different issues.
</P>
<P>
He told the Iranian foreign minister that the 15-nation
organization intended to proceed with a "new dialog" with Iran.
</P>
<P>
"The diversity of the subjects we discussed indicates the talks
are comprehensive," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 11-member EU team, which arrived here Saturday morning, held
the first talks with Iranian officials in more than one year. The
talks focused on the Middle East peace process, international
terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, Iran's human rights
situation and its death sentence on British writer Salman Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
The troika EU team include officials from Britain, Austria and
Germany, representing the previous, current and future holders of
EU's rotating presidency.
</P>
<P>
Rohan said the EU had similar views with Iran on some
international issues, especially the regional problems, adding
that the delegation would report the outcome of the talks to the
European Commission which would adopt an action plan.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU regarded dialog with Iran valuable in the belief
that it would lead to better understanding between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He also underlined the importance of cooperation in the
campaign against drug trafficking. Kharrazi accepted the proposal
for coordinating their anti-drugs fight.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said the time for "critical dialog" was over and
under the new atmosphere, a new chapter should be opened for talks
and mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
The EU started the purported "critical dialog" with Iran in
December 1992 with the aim to soften Tehran's policies on some key
issues.
</P>
<P>
But the dialog was suspended in April 1997 due to a row over a
Berlin court ruling that Iranian leaders were involved in a
political assassination in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The EU decided to resume talks with Iran last March after the
two sides reached a compromise over the diplomatic row.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Reaffirms Determination to Lift UN Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin
Ramadhan warned Sunday that Iraqi leadership and people would not
wait for another year for lifting the eight-year crippling
U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Ramadhan made the remarks in a speech to a cultural symposium
held by the ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party to celebrate its 30
year rule.
</P>
<P>
The top Iraqi leader said approaches adopted in the past by
Iraq's leadership in dealing with the UNSCOM, or U.N. Special
Commission on disarmament in Iraq, and the Security Council had
not led to the lifting of sanctions despite Iraq's fulfillment of
all relevant U.N. resolutions and its absolute cooperation with
the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary," Ramadhan added, "this has led
to...flagrant interference in Iraq's internal affairs. So Iraqi
leadership would decide in a serious way on the active
approaches to deal with UNSCOM and the Security Council."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. newspaper Wall Street Journal reported Friday that
the U.S. government had sent a classified notice to Congress,
asking it to approve the use of secret contingency funds for
operations within Iraq in an attempt to weaken and possibly
overthrow Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The paper also disclosed that a recent U.S. State Department
report to Congress also outlined plans to establish an Iraqi
center in suburban London and to support Iraqi opposition members
in exile.
</P>
<P>
Ramadhan said the Arab and internation public opinion had
shown understanding toward Iraq's legitimate demand, which is
based on facts and documents that exposed the aggressive policy
pursued by U.S. administration against the Iraqi people and Arab
Nation.
</P>
<P>
Ramadhan attacked the double standard and procrastination
policy pursued by the U.S. and its hegemony over the Security
Council and UNSCOM to achieve its ill-intentions against Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here noticed that the remarks of Ramadhan echoed
those of Saddam in his speech Friday to mark the 30th anniversary
of the 1968 Revolution that brought his party to power.
</P>
<P>
In his nationally televised speech, Saddam vowed to lift the
U.N. sanctions imposed since the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi president warned if Iraq's cooperation with the
UNSCOM and the Security Council would not lead to the lifting of
sanctions, Iraq would be forced to adopt alternative strategies,
which he did not elaborate.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Diplomatic Missions in Deplorable State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Foreign Minister Kelly
Walubita disclosed here Sunday that the country's diplomatic
missions abroad are in deplorable state and in need of urgent
repair to avoid embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Zambia News Agency ZANA, Walubita said
that chanceries and residences of Zambian missions abroad are in
a bad shape, a situation which is not good especially in big
cities where several other missions exist.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the situation to the general financial
constraints the country is facing and the continued depreciation
of the Kwacha against hard currency which is eroding the budgeted
amounts for missions abroad.
</P>
<P>
Some missions abroad are in debts emanating from non-payment
of rental arrears, prompting some of the landlords to contemplate
suing the Zambian government, said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
He cited the mission in Paris as one which is threatened with
legal action by the landlord who also requested the Paris
government to waive the diplomatic immunity the mission enjoys to
pave way for the action.
</P>
<P>
As a result of such constraints, Walubita said, the Zambian
government is considering purchasing buildings to be used as
missions as opposed to renting as this will save the country a
lot of money.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government is committed to ensure a smooth
flow of Zambian cadres to work in the diplomatic services as
career diplomats.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Spends $1.5 Million Compensating Extra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Though one of the least
developed countries in the world, Tanzania pays its workers one
billion Shillings (about 1.5 million US Dollars) for compensating
each of their public holidays which falls on weekends.
</P>
<P>
Participants in a workshop organized by the International
Labor Organization (ILO) office here said it's high time the
government got rid of this law "which destroys the country,"
media reports here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Africaus Maend, principal secretary of Association of
Tanzania, said according to the law, which allows holidays
falling on weekends or any resting day to be compensated on the
following day, each worker can get an averaged 1,000 Shillings
(about 1.5 US Dollar) per day.
</P>
<P>
"If you multiply one million workers by 1,000 Shillings, the
government will spend one billion Shillings on them who neither
produce goods nor provide services on that holiday," he said.
</P>
<P>
Judge Raymond Mwaikasu, chairman of the Industrial Court of
Tanzania, said the compensation of holidays results in
unnecessary losses to people coming from countryside for various
business in the cities on the "extended" holidays.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania is among the poorest countries in the world and its
people are supposed to work more and not to entertain holidays
which do not build the country," Mwaikasu said.
</P>
<P>
The workshop drew more than 50 officials from the Ministry of
Work, the Ministry of Social Welfare, Women and Children, the
Tanzania Federation of Trade Unions and the Industrial Court.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a report by a newspaper here said Tanzanian civil
servants kill nearly half a year on weekends, holidays and tea
breaks.
</P>
<P>
`The Sunday News daily backed by the government said its survey
in March showed that for every civil servant, he or she enjoys
about 96 Saturdays and Sundays, 18 public holidays, a 28-day
leave every year.
</P>
<P>
The civil servants are well-known to spend at least two hours
a day for tea break or other private business, or a total of at
least 40 days a year. This brings the total number of manpower
lost a year to 182 days, or nearly half a year, said the survey.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Appeals for Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
Sunday called on the Greek and Turkish Cypriots to reach a
compromise, enabling them to live together again in peace and
security.
</P>
<P>
In a televised address to mark the 24th anniversary of Turkey's
military intervention in the Mediterranean island, Clerides urged
the two communities to join the "consensual and unifying trend" of
dialog, cooperation and mutual support in the world.
</P>
<P>
"The sooner we realize this situation, the sooner we shall
benefit from its positive elements," he said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of
Cyprus in 1974 after a failed coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking
union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
On Cyprus' efforts to win European Union (EU) membership,
Clerides said the EU had sent a clear message that the two
communities would gain equal benefits from entering the EU and that
the Cyprus problem was not an obstacle to the accession.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his proposal that the Turkish Cypriots join the
Cypriot negotiating team, saying that it was "still valid."
</P>
<P>
The proposal put forward last March when the accession talks
between Cyprus and the EU started has been rejected by Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, who walked out of the peace talks in
protest.
</P>
<P>
Denktash said he would not return to the peace talks unless the
EU talks with Cyprus are halted and his breakaway entity is
internationally recognized. The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983
the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which was recognized
only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clerides stood firm on Cyprus' right of national
defense despite the international opposition to its controversial
plan to deploy missiles in the island.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have escalated in the island since Cyprus signed a
deal with Russia in January 1997 to buy the S-300 anti-aircraft
missile system. The United States and the EU have criticized the
move, saying its deployment will aggravate the tensions.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has repeatedly threatened to launch preemptive strikes
to destroy the missile system if it is deployed.
</P>
<P>
"We shall not accept any restrictions on our right to
defense," he said, stressing that Cyprus was compelled to
exercise the right by the presence of Turkish troops on the island.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is stationing 3,500 troops in the north.
</P>
<P>
"Our decision to continue to strengthen our defense with every
kind of defensive weapon which we believe will maximize our
security is irreversible," Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that the missile deal would be cancelled
"only if intercommunal talks resume and there is sufficient
progress toward the finding of a solution or if substantive steps
are taken toward demilitarization" of the island.

CAIRO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs

<P>
AMMAN -- The Arab Bank Group has earned 163 million
U.S. dollars in tax deductible profit in the first half of this
year, up 20.59 percent from the same period last year, the
semi-official Jordan Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Majid Shoman, Chairman of the group's Board of Directors,
attributed the achievement to the group's wise operation and its
expansion program.
</P>
<P>
The Arab Bank, the largest privately-owned bank in the Arab
world, started in March to issue bonus shares to expand
its business in Europe, the U.S. and the Far East, which raised its
capital from 62 million to 124 million dollars
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- The Iranian Majlis (Parliament) Sunday decided to
lift a ban on export of agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
Cheese is first priority among the proposed exports because
Iranian cheese supply has exceeded domestic need.

TEHRAN -- Iran announced Sunday it is to build its third largest
air terminal in the New Arg free trade zone in Bam in the central
province of Kerman, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Arafat Due in Cairo Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
will visit here Tuesday to brief Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
on the results of the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli talks, Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the announcement when he was commenting on the
talks held in Tel Aviv between senior Palestinian negotiator
Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) and Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
This was the first high-level talks between the two sides in
months.
</P>
<P>
"There is no middle way between the U.S. initiative and the
Israeli attitude," Moussa said, adding that Egypt would not exert
pressure on the Palestinians because this is not in line with
Cairo's policy.
</P>
<P>
"The fragmentation of the U.S. initiative is an Israeli demand
unaccepted by anybody," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has reportedly proposed that Israel withdraw from
another 13 percent of the West Bank. The Palestinians have
accepted the proposal, but Israel has rejected citing security
concerns.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials have said they would not renegotiate the
U.S. initiative with the Israeli side and they would listen to
Israeli ideas on the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moussa expected an Egyptian-Syrian summit to be held
within a few days. Mubarak is expected to discuss with Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad the latest developments of the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
To further coordinate with other countries, Moussa will visit
France Monday to lay down the details of an Egyptian-French
proposal on holding an international conference to save the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Such an international conference would become a necessity in
light of the expected Israeli rejection of the U.S. initiative,
Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
"If Israel explicitly rejects to pullout from 13 percent of the
West Bank in line with the U.S. plan, holding such a conference
anywhere would be inevitable," he added.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Paris in May, Mubarak and French President
Jacques Chirac proposed that an international conference be held
to break the 16-month-old deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process.

Cyprus signed a deal with Russia early last year to buy the
S-300 missiles with an aim to boost defense.
</P>
<P>
The move has angered the Turkish Cypriots and Turkey, which has
threatened to launch preemptive actions to destroy the missiles.
</P>
<P>
But during a recent visit to Russia, Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides and his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin reiterated the
position that the two countries will go ahead with the missile
deal.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest agreement between Cyprus and Russia,
the missiles will be delivered and deployed in Cyprus by the end
of November.
</P>
<P>
On July 13, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash said that
Turkey will retaliate if the Cypriot government deploys the
missiles on the divided island.
</P>
<P>
"Our position today stands at a point that you will get a
response to whatever you do," Denktash said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz is scheduled to fly to
northern Cyprus Monday to discuss with Turkish Cypriot officials
the latest tensions between the Turkish and Greek communities on
the island, especially Cyprus' plan to deploy the missiles.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the Mediterranean
island after a failed coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union
with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 the "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" recognized only by Ankara against the
internationally acknowledged Republic of Cyprus dominated by the
Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is stationing more than 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus
with a claimed aim to protect the Turkish Cypriot minorities.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian-French Initiative Not to Replace U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Egypt said on Sunday that the
Egyptian-French initiative on holding an international conference
on the Middle East peace process is not to substitute the
mediation role of the United States in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"The Egyptian-French initiative is to support the American
position in the peace process. It is not an alternative to the
American initiative," Mubarak told the country's Middle East News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Paris in May, Mubarak and French President
Jacques Chirac called for an international conference to find ways
of breaking the deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign minister Amr Moussa is scheduled to visit
Paris Monday to lay down the details of the joint initiative,
which is expected to take shape if a widely reported United States
proposal fails to be accepted by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has proposed that Israel withdraw from another 13.1
percent of the West Bank. The Palestinians have accepted the
proposal, but Israel has not. The Jewish state has said that it
would hand over no more than 9 percent of the West Bank to the
Palestinians for reasons of security interests.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Israeli, Palestinian Officials Agree on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEL AVIV, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Senior Israeli and Palestinian
officials ended their first direct talks in months here late
Sunday, agreeing to hold more follow-up talks to clinch a deal on
Israeli redeployment and other issues.
</P>
<P>
Trying to break the 16-month-old deadlock, Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), deputy
head of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), shook hands
before holding private talks.
</P>
<P>
The one-to-one talks were followed by an enlarged meeting
attended by other officials including Israeli Cabinet Secretary
Danny Naveh, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's attorney
Yitzhak Molcho and senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat. The
talks lasted for three and half hours.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Mazen said the two
sides discussed all issues concerning the peace process in the
hope that "such an endeavor will lead to a bridging of the sides."
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said the two sides agreed to create some "small
teams" to continue discussing all the issues, including the
dispute over a long overdue Israeli redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the first between the two sides in months, was
held at the request of the United States, which urged intensified
efforts to rescue the moribund peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two sides sought to overcome all the obstacles blocking the
progress of the peace process that has stalled for 16 months since
March last year when Israel began building a Jewish settlement in
the disputed Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda of the Mordechai-Mazen meeting was the
U.S. proposal calling for a 13.1 percent Israeli withdrawal in the
second stage of Israeli further redeployments in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Before the talks, local media reports speculated that Mordechai
would suggest setting up joint committees to discuss the
redeployment, demand annulling the Palestinian Covenant articles
calling for Israel's destruction, and press on the Palestinian
side on security issues.
</P>
<P>
The committees would conclude their works within a week.
</P>
<P>
On the second redeployment, it was widely reported that Israel
would try to persuade the Palestinians to accept its idea on
so-called Area D among the 13.1 percent withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
In this area, Israeli troops retain the right to reenter to
arrest suspected terrorists, and the Palestinian residents there
would not be allowed to build without permission.
</P>
<P>
But Palestinian officials have stressed that the proposed 13.1
percent of West Bank should be turned into Area A, which is under
complete PNA control.
</P>
<P>
Despite the PNA's endorsement of the U.S. plan, Israel has so
far rejected the idea, citing that any withdrawal exceeding 9
percent would endanger Israeli security interests. The
Palestinians insisted that the 13.1 percent proposal should not
be renegotiated.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of the Sunday talks, Palestinian officials downplayed any
prospect for any dramatic breakthrough. Palestinian Planning and
International Cooperation Minister Nabil Shaath said the chance of
success was "very limited."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Palestinian team would tell the Israelis
that they would not back down even an inch from the
U.S. initiative, which he described as the PNA's minimal demand.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's talks were also overshadowed by a failed car bombing
attempt in central Jerusalem allegedly launched by the
anti-Israeli militant Islamic Resistance Movement, or Hamas. A
Hamas suspect was arrested by Israeli police after suffering burns
in preparing for the attack. No one else was hurt.
</P>
<P>
Israel is expected to use the incident to press the Palestinian
side to do more to fight terrorism in future talks.

<HEADLINE> China Continues Its Domination at Asian Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- China continued to dominate women's
events at the Asian Athletics Championships in Fukuoka on Monday
despite Damayanthi Darsha of Sri Lanka took the 400m race.
</P>
<P>
Darsha clinched top place with a championship record run of
51.23 seconds, beating Svetlana Bodritskaya of Kazakhstan into
second in 52.46 and P.T. Usha third in 52.55.
</P>
<P>
Miki Imai of Japan made another break through by winning the
women's high jump with a meet record of 1.94m to beat fellow
Japanese Yoko Ota and East Asian Games champion Jin Ling of China.
</P>
<P>
But China still dominated four other women's events and its men's team
won two more gold medals.
</P>
<P>
Yan Jiankui defeated fellow Chinese defending champion Cui
Danfeng to become the new sprint champion in the women's 100m in
11.39, while Zhou Wei wrested the men's 100m title from Lin Wei,
winning it in 10.39.
</P>
<P>
The biggest surprise came earlier in the day when Atlanta
Olympic bronze medallist Wang Yan finished fifth in the women's
10km walk, leaving her teammate Li Yuxin to take her first
international victory in 46:41.
</P>
<P>
Li Lei defended the women's javelin with a 60.12m throw, while
Liu Jing timed 4:12.76 to make a Chinese one-two finish with Wang
Chunmei in the women's 1,500m.
</P>
<P>
Sugath Tillakaratne made it a Sri Lankan 400m double by winning
the men's race in a championship record time of 44.61, beating
Japan's Masayoshi Kan and Kenji Tabata into second and third.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Organizes Events to Mark Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Monday organized various
events to condemn Turkey's military intervention 24 years ago
which led to the division of this eastern Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
Greek Cypriots in the south were waked up at dawn by sirens
wailing to mark the hour that Turkish troops landed on the north of
the island on July 20, 1974, five days after a failed coup
launched by the Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
With bells toiling, residents flocked into local churchs in the
morning to hold services in memory of more than 5,000 people who
died or disappeared in the war with the Turks.
</P>
<P>
In the Primate of the Greek Orthodox Church of Cyprus,
Archbishop Chrysostomos led a prayer in the presence of Cyprus'
political and military leaders. The Archbishop also held a service
at the Saint John's Cathedral for those who lost their lives in
the fighting.
</P>
<P>
"We will never accept the fait accompli created by the
invasion and will continue our struggle until justice is done,"
President Glafcos Clerides said after laying a wreath at the
Makedonitissa Tomb in Nicosia, where soldiers killed during the
Turkish invasion were buried.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the Saint John's Cathedral, Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides vowed that "no blackmail, difficulty nor
pressure will force us to surrender to the Turkish Attila."
</P>
<P>
"Attila" was the code-name Turkey gave to its military
operation against Cyprus, which forced about 200,000 Greek
Cypriots to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
"Cyprus cannot and should not remain the only divided country
in Europe, when Europe itself is working toward its unification,"
Kasoulides said, adding that Europe should not accept the
situation in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The minister called for unity among the people of Cyprus and
Greece and Hellenism at large, in the struggle for vindication
and protection of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Greek Minister of Interior, Alecos Papadopoulos, who was in
Cyprus to attend the events, said he brought "feelings of love"
from the Greek government and Premier Costas Simitis to the Greek
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
He said the solidarity between the two countries was expressed
through a joint defense pact signed by the two governments in
1993, under which Greece will provide military assistance in case
Cyprus is attacked.
</P>
<P>
"The belief in freedom cannot be bent through guns and force,"
the Greek official said, referring to the presence of over 35,000
Turkish troops in the northern third of the island.
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast, Turkish Cypriots in the north held
celebrations to mark the 24th anniversary of the division of
Cyprus. Visiting Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz told Turkish
Cypriots it was Turkey that ended "Greek oppression" and foiled
the Greek attempt to annex Cyprus 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Turkey was determined to prevent the planned
deployment of Russian missiles by Cyprus, which has escalated
tensions in the island since early 1997.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus ordered the Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles in
January 1997 in a bid to boost its air defense. Cyprus has said
the missiles will be deployed late this year if no progress is
made in resuming the stalled peace talks and on its proposal for
demilitarizing the island.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia Monday expressed "serious
concern" over escalated hostilities in Kosovo and called for
cease-fire and negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin blamed Kosovo
separatists for the outbreak of fighting in the vicinity of
Orahovac, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"This is taking place due to overt, provocative actions on the
part of the Albanian militants," Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army
tried to storm the police station in Orahovac and capture its
first town in the five-month conflict.
</P>
<P>
"The Kosovo separatists should immediately ceasefire and resume
the negotiations to discuss the whole complex of problems of
Kosovo," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"What is happening makes it urgent for the Contact Group to set
a cease-fire as a condition for resumption of talks," Rakhmanin
said.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group includes the United States, Russia, Britain,
France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev and his Germany counterpart, Volker Ruhe, are to start a
two-day meeting Monday in the Russian resort of Sochi, and Kosovo
is expected to top their agenda.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Oil Prices Up Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The average price of OPEC's basket
of seven crudes increased last week, moving from 11.53
U.S. dollars per barrel from the week before to 11.97 dollars per
barrel, the Vienna-based OPEC Secretariat announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have been descending since the end of last year due
to oversupply.
</P>
<P>
To help boost the prices, OPEC decided in March and June to cut
the daily oil production of member countries. Some non-OPEC oil
producers also cut their production in a concerted effort to bring
up prices.
</P>
<P>
The average price a barrel stood at 11.65 dollars in June, much
lower than last year's average price of 18.68 dollars. The average
price was 13.35 dollars per barrel in the first quarter and 12.45
dollars in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC has set the benchmark price of oil per barrel at 21
dollars.

<P>
GENEVA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Nobel Laureate Ms Nadine Gordimer
of South Africa has been appointed goodwill ambassador for the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP), said the U.N. agency
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The South African writer will join another goodwill ambassador,
U.S. actor Danny Glover, in supporting UNDP efforts to build and
strengthen worldwide partnerships to fight poverty and underline
the imperative for international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"I have used my writing to support the fight against poverty
and degradation all of my life," said Gordimer. "Becoming a UNDP
goodwill ambassador will provide me with the opportunity to expand
awareness and develop partnerships in our ongoing effort to win
the war."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Assembly has designated 1997-2006 the U.N.
Decade for the Eradication of Poverty.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP wishes to enlist celebrities' support to turn urgent
public attention to poverty eradication and bring the issue to the
top of the international political agenda.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.3 billion of the world's people struggle to survive
on incomes of less than one dollar a day, according to U.N.
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Among the 4.4 billion people who live in developing countries,
almost three fifths live in communities without basic sanitation;
almost one third are without safe drinking water; one quarter lack
adequate housing; one fifth live beyond reach of modern health
services; one fifth of the children do not get as far as grade
five in school, and an equal percentage are undernourished.
</P>
<P>
"The new century is not going to be new at all if we offer only
charity, that palliative to satisfy the conscience and keep the
same old system of haves and have-nots quietly contained," said
Gordimer.
</P>
<P>
Born in 1923 at Springs, a small gold-mining town in South
Africa, Gordimer won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1991. She

<HEADLINE> S'pore External Trade in 1998 Expected to Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 20 (Xinhua)-- Singapore has projected that
total trade in 1998 would decline by between 4.5 and 5.5 percent
despite a rise in June.
</P>
<P>
In its "Review of Trade Performance and Outlook" released
Monday, the Trade Development Board (TDB) said it made the
projection after considering the slump in trade in the first half
of the year.
</P>
<P>
TDB said total trade, affected by the regional crisis and
global oversupply of key electronic products, declined by 7.7
percent in the second quarter of the year, reversing the 4.2
percent growth in the first quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Overall total trade shrank by 2 percent in the first half of
the year, TDB added.
</P>
<P>
However, TDB noted that the country's non-oil exports increased
by 6.1 percent in June following two consecutive months of decline
of 4.8 percent and 1.7 percent in May and April respectively.
</P>
<P>
TDB said its forecast is also based on the following factors:
</P>
<P>
-- Malaysia, Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea, hit by the
currency crisis, recorded a negative GDP growth in the first
quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
-- Possible slowdown in the economic growth in the United
States, the United Kingdom and Germany in the second half of the
year would affect both Singapore's direct exports to these markets
and exports of intermediate goods to the region to produce
products for these markets.
</P>
<P>
-- Global oversupply of key electronic products, such as disc
drives and integrated circuits, is likely to persist and weakened
demand, particularly in the Asian market, would linger on.
</P>
<P>
-- Many manufacturers had scaled down their operations in
Singapore and the region and this would affect exports of
intermediate goods to the region in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
-- Non-oil retained imports of intermediate goods, a short-term
indicator for manufacturing activities, had been declining for
four consecutive months since March 1998.
</P>
<P>
-- Oil trade for the second half of the year is likely to
remain weak with its price having fallen 18 percent in the first
half of the year due to strong competition from regional
refineries and weakening demand from Asia.

<HEADLINE> China, Italy Join Hands to Explore Bohai Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The China National Offshore Oil
Corp (CNOOC) and the Italian Agip Oil Company signed a contract
here today to explore for oil in the 09/11 block of the Bohai Sea.
</P>
<P>
The current contract is the 134th offshore oil contract China
has signed with foreign oil companies, according to a CNOOC source.
</P>
<P>
The source said the contracted 09/11 block lies in the western
part of the Bohai Sea some 25 kilometers southeast of Tanggu,
Tianjin City in north China, and covers an area of 850 square
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, Agip will undertake the risk alone and take
charge of such offshore operations as geological studies,
collection of 3-D seismic data and drilling exploratory wells.
</P>
<P>
According to years of exploratory practice and geological
studies, China's Bohai Bay area is rich in oil and gas resources
and many oil and gas structures have been found near the
promising 09/11 block.
</P>
<P>
According to the CNOOC source, Agip was one of the earliest to

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Recovers From Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen made a public appearance Monday after recovery
from an operation for appendix removal.
</P>
<P>
The appearance at Calmette Hospital, where the operation was
conducted, was aimed at refuting rumors that he was seriously ill,
or had already left the country for Singapore and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen told reporters that he felt very well and would leave
the hospital Tuesday and start work on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I am very satisfied with the process of the elections. I
believe the election will be held freely and fairly without
intimidation and violence," said Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Cambodia's future coalition government, Hun Sen
said it is too early to talk about this. He denied suggestions
that the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) had already made a secret
deal with a main political party.
</P>
<P>
He stressed: "It will depend on the results of the elections.
The CPP will not rule out the possibility of forming a coalition
government with some small political parties, not only the main
political parties."
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen fell ill when he attended the opening ceremony of an
irrigation project Friday in Takeo province and was taken
immediately to Calmette Hospital.
</P>
<P>
King Norodom Sihanouk and Hun Sen's political rivals, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, have sent Hun Sen wishes for a
speedy recovery.

<HEADLINE> China Founds Committee to Protect Lawyers' Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The China National Committee of
Protection of Lawyers' Rights and Interests was established here
today.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting on the protection of lawyers' rights, the
All-China Lawyers' Association (ACLA) said the establishment of
the organization was against the backdrop of increasing
infringement upon lawyers' legitimate rights and interests during
their legal practice.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the reform and opening up program, the
legal status of lawyers in China was changed from "legal workers
of the country" to independent professionals. They are playing an
increasingly more important role in protecting the legal rights
and interests of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhu Hongchao, vice-president of the ACLA, said while
they have shrugged off the "governmental title," and are involved
more in social and economic activities, their own rights and
interests are being increasingly encroached.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, the number of these infringement cases hit a
historic high in 1996 and 1997, either of which witnessed more
than ten malignant cases.
</P>
<P>
Only 30 percent of the cases submitted from all over the
country to the ACLA were resolved, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Ruihua, a professor of law in Beijing University,
stressed that the accused lawyers should be given the right to
defend themselves at a hearing before a verdict is made.

<HEADLINE> Community Service Absorbing Laid-off Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nanchang, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Laid-off workers in China are
being encouraged to settle down in new jobs that serve local
communities.
</P>
<P>
In Nanchang city, capital of east China's Jiangxi Province,
Zhou Lijun, a laid-off woman worker and newly-elected chairperson
of a neighborhood committee, is now launching a campaign to
provide job opportunities for fellow laid-off workers to render
communal services.
</P>
<P>
So far, 13 people have been put back to work, either looking
after the old and young, or doing some cleaning.
</P>
<P>
Similar re-employment services are being provided by nearly
5,000 neighborhood committees in the city, which has now some
100,000 laid off workers. As a result, some 14,000 laid-offs are
now back working again.
</P>
<P>
Among those working on the committees, 670 were elected to
their present posts after they were suspended from work in
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The self-support efforts of communities to tackle the
unemployment problem can also be found in Beijing, Shanghai and
other major cities. Those willing to work in their own communities
are able to enjoy tax-exemptions and low interest loans.
</P>
<P>
In the Dongcheng District of Beijing, more than 50,000 laid-off
workers have signed up for a communal-services network.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, In Shanghai, the Electrical Appliances Maintenance
Shop of Xingyi Neighborhood Community, set up by Zhang Wenlong, an
ex-worker at a color-TV factory, now boasts 12 chainstores and has
employed 124 laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
Economists have become aware of the new role of neighborhood
communities in dealing with reemployment. It takes a joint effort
by the government, society at large, as well as individuals to
tackle this problem, said Huang Zhigang, vice-president of the
Institute of Economics at the Academy of Social Sciences of
Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Li Yining, a professor of economics at Beijing University, also
said that people should rely more on the reform of institutions
and less on the increase in investment to get people employed
again.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted in seven major cities across
the country by an information company under the State Statistical
Bureau, 70 percent of urban households are in need of communal
services. This amounts to 20 million employment opportunities,
half of which remain open.

<HEADLINE> No Ban on Car Ads: Commissioner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior European Commission
official denied on Monday that the executive body of the European
Union (EU) had any plans to put constraints on car advertisements.
</P>
<P>
Neil Kinnock, the European commissioner responsible for
transport policy, said he wished to reassure manufacturers and
consumers alike that there are no plans to introduce bans in car
advertising.
</P>
<P>
The German newspaper Bild reported over the weekend that the
European Commission was considering proposing a ban in car ads.
</P>
<P>
"These (news) stories are totally false and do great harm by
creating unnecessary concern," said Kinnock.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials figured that the root of the Bild story
lay in the fact that British advertisers voluntarily offered not
to link base publicity for cars on their speed performance after
Britain started preparation for its presidency of the 15-nation
European Union, which was from January 1 to June 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
During its preparation for the rotating EU presidency, Britain
asked the commission services to investigate, informally, whether
there would be any benefit in extending throughout the union a
voluntary code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
But the commission did not support the idea though Britain put
the concept to discussion at a high-level working group of the
commission.

<HEADLINE> Greek Leader Hopes For Closer Ties with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Greek Parliament President
Apostolos Kaklamanis expressed his hope on Monday for the
all-round development in Greek-Chinese relations.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Kaklamanis said there was still
much room for further expansion of relations between the two
countries, not only in the economic field, but also in political
and other fronts.
</P>
<P>
Both countries shared a lot in common in views on numerous
international issues and in their national interests, and both
have splendid ancient civilizations behind them, he said.
</P>
<P>
These common aspects heralded a very positive future for the
further expansion of ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He expressed full satisfaction with the outcome of his first
official visit to China earlier this month. He said his talks with
the Chinese leadership had very broad dimensions.
</P>
<P>
China was not only a great regional power, but upon completion
of economic reforms, it would become a main actor on the world
stage as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his visit to Tibet, Kaklamanis said it was
evident, from his first hand impressions, great efforts had been
made by the Chinese government to improve the living standards of
the Tibetan people, who, until some decades ago, still lived under
primitive circumstances, and secluded in a feudal regime.

<HEADLINE> Air Route Linking Xiamen of China, Osaka of Japan Operational </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A Boeing 767-300 aircraft of the
Japan Air Transportation Co. Ltd. (JAT) took off from Gaoqi
Airport in east China's port city of Xiamen this afternoon
for Osaka, Japan, marking the opening of this new route.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed in May by JAT and the Gaoqi
Airport, JAT's planes will depart Xiamen for the three-hour flight
three times a week, on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
This is Xiamen's first air route to Japan.
</P>
<P>
An official from JAT said the opening of the air route will
help develop the port city's rich tourist resources as well as its
export of aquatics and fruit to Japan, adding that Xiamen's cuisine
especially appeals to the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
The passenger seats were filled on the initial flight,
according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
JAT aims to operate at 60 percent of capacity on the route
during its first year, which means 40,000 passengers and 2,000
tons of cargo.
</P>
<P>
As Japan's leading carrier, JAT opened its China service in
1987. It now has 12 air routes linking major Japanese cities
including Tokyo, Osaka and Fukuoka with Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian,
Qingdao, Hong Kong and Xiamen.
</P>

<HEADLINE> EU Citizens Among the Top Fish Eaters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Consumption by each European
Union citizen of fish and fish products each year ranks among the
highest in the world, second only to that in Iceland and Japan,
Eurostat reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg-based statistical office said a European ate an
average of 22 kilograms of fish and fish products a year, and fish
supplies around six percent of the European's protein intake.
</P>
<P>
In Iceland and Japan, consumption of fish and fish products
amounts to 93 kilograms and 68 kilograms a person per year,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member E.U. groups Belgium, Germany, Spain, France,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal,
Finland, Greece, Sweden, Denmark and Britain.
</P>
<P>
In the bloc, Portugal and Spain top the fish consumption scale
with an annual 57 kilograms and 39 kilograms for each person,
while landlocked Austria has the smallest per capita fish
consumption of 10 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Coastal Germany and the Netherlands are also low in fish
consumption, both with 12 kilograms per person annually.
</P>
<P>
Denmark is the largest producer of fish and fish products, with
an output amounting to a quarter of the E.U. total, followed by
Spain and Britain.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines' Financial Losses Worsen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines (PAL), which
has already incurred staggering financial losses over the last
five years, said that it is facing a worsening financial situation
in the new fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
In its preliminary financial statements for April and May 1998,
the first two months of the current fiscal year, the PAL said that
it suffered a net loss of 391.6 million pesos (9.6 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The figure is nearly four times the 101.2 million pesos (2.5
million dollars) loss incurred in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The deficit did not include the financial results for the month
of June, which is expected to be much worse because of the massive
disruption in PAL's operations caused by the illegal pilots'
strike starting June 5.
</P>
<P>
The strike, which lasted for 22 days and led to an extensive
downsizing of PAL operations, cost the flag carrier some 150
million pesos (3.4 million dollars) per day in lost revenue and
additional expenses.
</P>
<P>
PAL has accumulated losses of 14.9 billion pesos (363 million
dollars) over the last five fiscal years. The airline is just
coming off a record 8.1 billion pesos (197.6 million dollars) net
loss in the last fiscal year ending March 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
The flag carrier, which is beset by labor disputes that
threaten to aggravate its precarious financial condition, is
presently under the receivership with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) while a rehabilitation plan is being drawn up.
</P>
<P>
The SEC has warned that it will dissolve the PAL if a new
strike by the airline's ground crew breaks out since this will
just kill any proposed rehabilitation plan.

<HEADLINE> Arianespace Keen on Philippines' Satellite Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- European satellite launcher
Arianespace has expressed interest in launching Agila III, the
Philippines' second satellite, the official Philippine News Agency
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Agila III is expected to be sent into orbit by Mabuhay
Philippines Satellite Corp. (MPSC) in 1999, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Jean Marie Luton, chairman and chief executive officer of
Arianespace, was quoted as saying they are willing to grant the
Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) -- the major
stockholder of MPSC -- or any Asian company to a longer payment
period so they would subscribe to Arianespace.
</P>
<P>
Luton said because of the financial crisis, they expect
satellite companies to have difficulty in meeting payments, and
thus measures of flexibility would be introduced.
</P>
<P>
The MPSC tapped China to launch Agila II in August 1997 in
China. Agila II is an interim satellite used during the APEC
Summit in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
PLDT is planning to launch Agila III in 1999 and has reportedly
sent feelers to Arianespace.
</P>
<P>
But Arianespace officials said talks with MPSC were very loose
and there was no assurance yet that Agila III would push through
given the currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Richard Bowles, Arianespace director for Southeast Asia who
visited the Philippines recently, said, "We're interested in other
companies as long as there's a satellite to launch."
</P>
<P>
Bowles said MPSC will never go wrong if it chooses Arianespace
which has only three failures in its past 69 launches.
</P>
<P>
Arianespace is the world's first commercial transportation
company which represents the scientific, technical, financial and
political capabilities of 12 countries.

<HEADLINE> Sino-European Cooperation in Space Technology Hailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The successful launching of a
European-made satellite by a Chinese carrier rocket demonstrates
wide prospects for Sino-European cooperation, said Zhang Xinxia,
president of the China Great Wall Industry Corporation here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang made the remark at a reception in celebration of the
successful launching into orbit of the SinoSat-1 communications
satellite by the Chinese Long March 3B Rocket Carrier on July 18
from the Xichang Launch Center in southwest China's Sichuan
Province.
</P>
<P>
The SinoSat-1, manufactured by Alcatel Space of France, was the
first European satellite ever sent into space by a Chinese-made
rocket carrier.
</P>
<P>
This first successful cooperation between the Chinese and
European space industries has expanded the international
commercial launching scope of China's space industry and shows the
broad prospects for future cooperation between the two sides,
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The contract for this space program was signed between the
China Great Wall Industry Corporation and Germany-based EurasSpace.
</P>
<P>
EurasSpace's Managing Director Dr. Klaus Ninke also spoke at
the ceremony. In his remarks, he confirmed that the technology and
reliability of the Long March 3B, as well as related launch
activities, have made Chinese launching company highly competitive
with other launching agencies in this international market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Executive Vice-President of Alcatel Space, Bernard
Deloffre, deemed this cooperative program to be of mutual benefit,
and said that "the program has been carried out very smoothly from
the beginning, and very many Chinese personnel have taken part in
it."
</P>
<P>
"The launching is a great success," he said, adding, "We hope
to extend our cooperation into other areas."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Ask Exporters to Deposit Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
Monday ordered the country's monetary authorities to study the
possible abolition of a 1982 government regulation which exempts
exporters from depositing their foreign exchange in the central
bank.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Habibie here, former central bank official
Tarmidzi Rangkuti said the 1982 government regulation allows every
one to obtain and use foreign exchange at will.
</P>
<P>
It allows exporters to use foreign exchange earned from the
products they export, he said, adding that this runs counter to
Law No. 32/64 which states that the government controls foreign
exchange earned from the country's natural resources.
</P>
<P>
So long as this government regulation is effective, exporters
would not feel obligated to contribute their foreign exchange to
the government, he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian exporters earn about 3.6 billion U.S. dollars a
month, Tarmidzi said, noting that most of this amount is saved
abroad, like in Singapore, and used for speculations which inflict
harm on the country.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the government regulation should be abolished
as the law carries more weight than the regulation.
</P>
<P>
He cited as an example that even the United States compels its
exporters to deposit foreign exchange in the central bank.

meters, compared with the figures on July 17, according to the city's
water resources bureau.
</P>
<P>
The rising water level has brought new threats to local dikes
and embankments that have experienced four flood-peaks and heavy
rainstorms in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Local experts fear that the alarming water level may remain
high for some time.
</P>
<P>
Rescue teams of more than 100,000 local people have been sent
to guard the endangered dikes.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the Ministry of Water Resources and local
governments in the area have raised 16.73 million yuan (2 million
US dollars) to repair dikes on the Yangtze River's Jiujiang
Section.

<HEADLINE> Entertainment Stars to Aid Dropout Schoolgirls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 well-known
entertainers will attend a series of activities which began in
Beijing today to help dropout schoolgirls in poor rural areas to
return to school.
</P>
<P>
The activities, jointly sponsored by the China Children and
Teenagers Fund, Beijing Culture and Art Audio and Video Publishing
House and "Performing Arts" pictorial magazine, also aim to
promote concerns for public welfare among entertainers.
</P>
<P>
The activities will include direct donations to dropout
schoolgirls from film, TV and singing stars, benefit performance
tours around the country, and collection of songs from
Chinese-speaking areas in the world.
</P>
<P>
Both the direct donations and the box office income from
performances will be used for the "Spring Bud Project," which was
started by the China Children and Teenagers Fund under the
All-China Women's Federation in 1989 to help poor dropout girls go
back to school.
</P>
<P>
China has more than one million new school dropouts each year,
two-thirds of whom are girls, said Kang Ling, Vice-Chairman of the
fund. She said that the "Spring Bud Project" has already received
200 million yuan (about 24 million U.S. dollars) in donations and
has helped more than 600,000 girls.
</P>
<P>
"For girls, knowledge and skills provided by education is the
basis for their future development," said Pu Cunxi, a famous
Chinese actor, who spoke on behalf of all the actors
and actresses participating in the activities. "We want to repay
the society by helping dropout school girls."
</P>
<P>
Experts said that these activities will help form a system in
China's interior areas which will provide more opportunities for
entertainment stars to contribute to the public welfare.

<HEADLINE> Quality of Domestic Air Conditioners Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Air conditioners produced by large
domestic manufacturers have been improving in quality since 1995,
according to the result of a survey released today by the State
Quality and Technology Inspection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The survey included 35 major air conditioner manufacturers in
Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin municipalities and Guangdong,
Jiangsu, Sichuan, Zhejiang, Anhui, Liaoning and Shandong
Provinces. Among the products surveyed, 88.6 percent passed the
quality tests.
</P>
<P>
The quality of room air conditioners made by domestic
enterprises have reached world standards in terms of both the
appearance and working quality, said an expert from the State
Quality and Technology Inspection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, some domestic famous brands have now
entered the international market, offering electricity-saving, low
pollution, high efficiency and other superior qualities.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found there are still a few companies paying
little attention to the quality of their products. The state
bureau has called on quality inspection departments across the
country to tighten control of those enterprises and urge them to
improve the quality of their products.

<HEADLINE> Millennium Bug Should Be Tacked in Time: HK Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Kwong Ki-chi, secretary for
Information Technology and Broadcasting of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), said here Monday that the Year 2000
problem for computers is a management issue rather than just a
technical problem.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a luncheon hosted by the Hong Kong General Chamber
of Commerce, Kwong said that the Year 2000 problem is a management
issue which affects the survival of businesses if it is not fixed
in time.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted by the Hong Kong Productivity
Council in the first quarter of 1997, about two-thirds of the
businesses in Hong Kong would be affected by the Year 2000
problem, Kwong said.
</P>
<P>
According to the same survey, about 40 percent of the
respondents which were mainly small and medium-sized enterprises
did not know or had never heard about the problem; 40 percent did
not know if their systems would be affected; and almost half of
them did not have plans to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
"This was the situation more than a year ago. The awareness of
the problem has improved significantly since then, and
particularly in recent months following the publicity campaign
launched by my bureau," Kwong said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, even if people know what the problem is, they may
not be fully aware of its impact, he added.
</P>
<P>
"There are some hard facts about the Year 2000 problem which we
cannot afford to ignore," Kwong said.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, it is a management problem because it goes beyond the
narrow confines of IT, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the face of it, if the problem affects a computerized system
or a system with embedded microprocessors, the IT professionals
should know what the consequences of failure of that system, Kwong
said.
</P>
<P>
But this is too superficial an inference, he said. The true
consequence will need to be assessed by the management carefully,
taking into account all upstream and downstream implications, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
And, the risk extends far beyond the confines of the company
concerned. This is because no business works in isolation. It must
also examine the potential disruption which may be caused by its
suppliers and customers if their systems are not Year 2000
compliant, he continued.
</P>
<P>
Also, the more sophisticated the company in the use of IT, the
more likely it is to have frequent and extensive exchanges of
information with third parties, including its customers, business
partners and vendors. Obviously, the longer the dependency chain,
the harder is the problem, Kwong said.
</P>
<P>
"Second, I have heard from many IT professionals working in the
larger firms that the real difficulty faced by them is not the
lack of technical expertise or resources," Kwong said.
</P>
<P>
What they lack is the management will and determination to face
up to and tackle the problem, he added. Once again, it is a
management problem.
</P>
<P>
"Third, we are all facing the same immovable deadline," Kwong
went on to say. The best way to solve the problem is to start
early, to allow sufficient float for project slippage or delay due
to foreseen or unforeseen factors; and most important of all, to
give enough time to perform testing before the new systems are
allowed to run through January 1, 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is worth noting that even if your own systems are
compliant, you may still need contingency plans for dealing with
those of your business partners who may still be Year 2000
non-compliant for whatever reason," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Information Technology and Broadcasting Bureau was
established in April this year to oversee policies for Information
Technology, Telecommunications and Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
The need for this new grouping of policy responsibilities arose
from the fast converging technology in IT, telecommunications and
broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
The primary goal of the new bureau is to ensure the development
of Hong Kong as the leading IT, telecommunications and
broadcasting center in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
If Hong Kong is to maintain its status as a leading
international financial and business center and to remain
competitive in the global market, it has to keep itself in the
forefront of IT development, and to make the best use of advances
in IT to improve the quality and efficiency of the services it
offers, Kwong said.

</P>
<P>
In a letter to a national fiscal policy meeting, which opened

He urged the fiscal system to earnestly serve the macroeconomic
development and carry out the fiscal policies and measures
formulated by the central government to expand domestic demand and

<P>
He said expenditures should be readjusted to increase
investment in infrastructure construction and ensure expenditures
in key areas, and that general expenditure should be firmly

<HEADLINE> Record Number of Travelers in China in First Half of 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A record 68 million travelers
exited and entered China in the half of this year, a rise of 9.77
percent over with the same period last year, according to the Exit
and Entry Administration under the Ministry of Public Security.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the Administration said that China's
border inspection departments have adopted a series of measures
over recent years to improve their services and simplify
procedures, in an effort to adapt to the increasing number of
Chinese citizens going abroad.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the first half, more than 4.13 million
Chinese citizens went abroad, approximately the same number as the
same period last year. Of these, 2.58 million went on official
business, down 11 percent, and 1.54 traveled for private purposes,
up 16.31 percent.
</P>
<P>
Inland Chinese citizens visited 235 countries and regions, with
Chinese Hong Kong, Chinese Macao, Thailand, Japan, Russia, the
United States, Singapore, the Republic of Korea, the People's
Republic of Korea, and Australia topping the list.
</P>
<P>
And in the first six months, entry and exit by residents from
Hong Kong and Macao totaled 51.18 million, accounting for 75.21
percent of the total, with the daily number of entries and exits
averaging 280,500.
</P>
<P>
Some 3.38 million foreign citizens from 251 countries and
regions visited China, down 2.44 percent compared with same period
last year, which experts here attribute to the financial crisis
that hit some Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Entry and exit by people from Japan, Russia, the United States,
the Republic of Korea, Mongolia, Singapore, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Britain, and Germany headed the list of foreign
visitors to China.
</P>
<P>
China's border inspection departments also dealt with 23,763
people who had violated the country's entry and exit regulations,
an increase of 29 percent compared with same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the official disclosed that in the same six-month
period, China's border inspection departments apprehended 202
criminals convicted of major crimes and saved 230 million yuan
(27.7 million US dollars) in state funds.

<HEADLINE> CPC, CPJ to Increase Bilateral Exchanges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior Communist Party of China
(CPC) official and the leader of the Communist Party of Japan
(CPJ) today expressed the hope of increasing exchanges between the
two parties.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming meeting between top leaders of the CPC and CPJ
would open up a new chapter in the annals of party-to-party
relations and bilateral relations, said Hu Jintao, member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of CPC Central
Committee, during a meeting with a delegation led by Chairman
Tetsuzo Fuwa of the Presidium of the CPJ Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Hu told Fuwa that the CPC would foster a new type of
party-to-party cooperative relationship with the CPJ under the
principles jointly confirmed by the two parties.
</P>
<P>
The CPC and the CPJ had enjoyed a long-standing friendly ties,
Hu noted, adding that the restoration and development of bilateral
friendly exchanges conform to the trend of the times and would
benefit the overall situation of Sino-Japanese friendship.
</P>
<P>
The CPC and CPJ announced the normalization of party-to-party
relations last month, after they severed the ties in the 1960s
when the Cultural Revolution happened in China.
</P>
<P>
Hu expressed his belief that the exchange and cooperation
between the CPC and the CPJ will be conducive to the growth of
Sino-Japanese relations and to the establishment of a long-term,
stable and good-neighborly Sino-Japanese relationship oriented-to
the next century.
</P>
<P>
Fuwa voiced his joy at the restoration of CPJ-CPC ties, and
said that the relations between Japan and China are on a crucial
point of growth.
</P>
<P>
The CPJ is not a party in power in Japan, but it is ready to
strengthen exchanges, increase the mutual understanding and
advance friendly ties with CPC in the spirit of looking forward,
so as to promote the healthy development of Japan-China relations,
Fuwa said.
</P>
<P>
The CPJ delegation arrived here Sunday at the invitation of the
CPC. Dai Bingguo, head of the International Department of the CPC
Central Committee, held talks with the delegation yesterday.

<HEADLINE> India to Invest 7 Billion Dollars on IT in 10 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- India intends to invest 7
billion U.S. dollars in information technology (IT) over the next
decade which is expected to generate an annual export revenue of
some 50 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
One of the convenors of the National Task Force on Information
Technology and Software Development, N. Seshagiri, said here
Monday that direct and indirect investment in IT from government,
public and private sectors would be to the tune of 6 to 7 billion
U.S. dollars till 2008.
</P>
<P>
The task force, set up by the Indian government on May 22, put
forward at the end of last month a series of recommendations for
the development of information technology and software in the
country and set the target of annual software exports of 50
billion U.S. dollars by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Giving details about the national information policy drawn up
by the task force, Seshagiri said one to three percent of every
ministry's outlay would be earmarked for information technology,
and every department in the central and state government has a
five-year IT action plan.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that on an average of two percent of outlay, an
annual expenditure of near 500 million U.S. dollars would flow
into the IT sector from government alone for purchase of IT
products including software and personnel training in addition to
spending by state governments.
</P>
<P>
On the recommendation of the special team, the Indian
government would make an immediate investment of 7 billion rupees
(170 million U.S. dollars) as a corpus fund to solve the year 2000
problem (Y2K) in government, public and private organizations and
services.
</P>
<P>
Seshagiri said that actual inflow of working capital into the
industry would be to the tune of 3 billion U.S. dollars by 2000
against the current projection of 1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Indian banks would be permitted to invest in dedicated capital
funds meant for IT industry as part of a five percent increment in
deposits currently allowed for shares, he said.
</P>
<P>
The task force said in its "IT Action Plan" submitted to Prime
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee last month that IT industry is
expected to create more than a million jobs in the next five years
when its recommendations are implemented.
</P>
<P>
The suggested measures include introduction of sweat equity to
IT employees, blanket approval for Indian IT firms to acquire
foreign companies and zero duty on all IT products by the year
2002.
</P>
<P>
The team also suggested 100 percent depreciation on all IT
products in two years, tripling of working capital requirements
for industry, ending Internet access monopoly, Internet access
through cable, introduction of authorized independent service
providers in all districts by 2000 and Internet to all schools,
polytechnic, colleges and universities by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Software has become one of India's main foreign exchange
earners with 68 billion rupees (1.7 billion U.S. dollars) for
software exports in 1997-98, recording a growth rate of 65 percent
over the previous year.

-- Democrats are trying to divide Republicans ahead of midterm
elections by promoting so-called wedge issues to split off
factions of the party. Lawmakers are attaching items to spending
bills to draw off Republican votes on issues ranging from mortgage
insurance to birth control.
</P>
<P>
-- Managed care is dominating congressional debate, but
Republicans and Democrats appear far apart and are ready to take
the issue into the fall elections if legislation fails. The White
House signaled it may be set to compromise over lawsuits for
denial of care.

<HEADLINE> Experimental Gun Ban to Be Imposed in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine national police chief
General Roberto Lastimoso said Monday an experimental gun ban
ordered by President Joseph Estrada will take effect Tuesday
across the country.
</P>
<P>
The ban will be in place until rash of killings and violent
crimes involving use of loose firearms were neutralized, Lastimoso
said.
</P>
<P>
Lastimoso's announcement came after six gunmen strafed an
armored van and its back-up vehicle Monday morning in a Manila
suburb, killing two security guards and seriously wounding four
others.
</P>
<P>
Lastimoso said the ban is aimed at confiscating loose firearms
and preventing abusive gun holders from committing crimes. Those
exempt from the ban are soldiers, policemen and civilians who have
permits to carry guns outside their homes.
</P>
<P>
Lastimoso said applications for permits to carry guns were
already suspended, pending normalization of peace and order in
Metro Manila and other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the Estrada administration, which has vowed
to restore peace and order in the country in six months, was
greeted by three ambushes which killed two senior government
officials.
</P>
<P>
Rampant kidnappings, which had plagued two past
administrations, still persist, resulting in the reported three
billion U.S. dollars capital flight out of the country last year.

<HEADLINE> EU Lists 12 Regional Products for Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
added 12 more agricultural and food products on Monday to its
Protection of Geographical Indication and Designation of Origin
(PGI-PDO) list.
</P>
<P>
The new additions, six beers from Germany, three
fruit/vegetables and two olive oils from Greece and one meat
product from Italy, have increased to 476 the total of
agricultural and food products under such protection.
</P>
<P>
The protection stipulates that the use of these registered
names must be confined to producers in a particular area that
comply with closely-defined rules and criteria for the production
of the products.
</P>
<P>
The EC has so far announced eight PGI-PDO lists.
</P>
<P>
When an agricultural or food product becomes famous outside its
area of origin, it tends to find itself competing in the
marketplace with imitation products making use of its brand name.
</P>
<P>
European Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler said this
unfair competition not only undermines the efforts made by the
producers or manufacturers to acquire a good name in the first
place, it also leaves consumers confused as to which product is
genuine and which is a copy.
</P>
<P>
The European Union introduced the PGI-PDO protection system in
1992 in an attempt to harmonize protection at European community
level for all food products other than wines and spirit beverages.
</P>
<P>
The protection of wines and spirit drinks is already covered by
earlier European community legislation.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Urges Cancellation of Mozambique's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's biggest opposition
party, the National Resistance Movement of Mozambique (Renamo)
has called for cancellation of the results of June 30 local
elections as "low turnout has discredited the winner."
</P>
<P>
Renamo Chairman Afonso Dhlakama made the call after the
results of the polls were out and he urged President Joaquim
Chissano to declare the elections null and void, the Noticias
daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
It was announced Friday that only 286,000 of the 1.96 million
voters in the 33 towns and cities turned out to cast their votes,
with over 85 percent of the eligible people abstaining from
voting.
</P>
<P>
Renamo Saturday celebrated the high abstention rate of the
just-ended elections in central Sofala Province's Beira city.
</P>
<P>
The high rate of boycott means a failure for the ruling
Mozambican Liberation Front (Frelimo), and will forecast Dhlakama
and his party's victory in the 1999 general elections, said
Renamo's Sofala official Manuel Pereira during the celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Pereira also accused the National Electoral Committee NEC) and
Electoral Technical Administration Secretariat of siding with the
ruling Frelimo party and serving it as a tool.
</P>
<P>
The NEC has passed the election results on to the Supreme
Court which will consider whether they are effective.
</P>
<P>
Frelimo ended up as winners for the posts of mayors and city
councillors in the local elections which were held in 23 cities
and 10 towns on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Renamo and 15 other opposition parties boycotted the
elections.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Cut Economic Aid to Egypt: Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- United States Ambassador in Cairo
Daniel Kurtzer has disclosed that his country will cut annual
economic aid to Egypt by 5 percent, Egypt's Al Ahram daily
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Arabic-language newspaper, Kurtzer
said the total amount cut from the economic aid will be a little
more than 40 million dollars, not 120 million dollars as reported
by U.S. newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The reduction to be in place as of the next U.S. fiscal year is
in line with the country's policy of slashing foreign assistance,
the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. grants Egypt an annual economic aid of 815 million
dollars in addition to a 1.3-billion-dollar military assistance
every year.
</P>
<P>
The military aid will be kept intact, according to the U.S.
diplomat.
</P>
<P>
Kurtzer said the two countries have held rounds of negotiations
recently to deal with the establishment of a new system of
bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The new system will put emphasis on enhancing economic and
trade cooperation and rescheduling the aid program, he added.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Supports Palestinian Struggle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Monday Malaysia's commitment to
supporting the Palestinian struggle remained very strong.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope to see that peace returns to the Middle East.
We hope that the Palestinian people will have the right to return
to their homeland, the struggle of the Palestinian people is the
struggle for human rights," he said at a joint news conference
with his Palestinian counterpart Farouk Khadoumi here after their
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Expressing Malaysia's regret that the United States had not
been successful in asserting influence on Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to move the peace process forward, Abdullah
said Malaysia would continue to ask the U.S. to assert its
influence on Netanyahu to take more positive efforts to break the
deadlocked West Asia peace process.
</P>
<P>
"In fact Netanyahu has completely ignored whatever peace
agreements that have been entered into between Israel and the
Palestinian people. This is certainly most regrettable," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah discussed with Khadoumi for about an hour the latest
developments in West Asia.
</P>
<P>
Voicing his appreciation to Malaysia for the firm support given
to the Palestinian cause, the Palestinian foreign minister said
the Israeli government headed by Netanyahu had caused a setback in
the peace process, which the previous Israeli government had
agreed on, while the U.S., as the main broker of the process, had
said that it was unable to convince the Israeli government to
carry out the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Khadoumi, who arrived here Sunday for a five-day visit, said
the Israeli government led by Netanyahu had made two major
decisions which very much undermined the peace process, with the
first defining Israel's vital national interests which included
the Eastern and Western security zones, the areas surrounding
Jerusalem, the areas of the settlements, infrastructure (water,
electricity and transportation) interests and military-security
sites, and the second making the implementation of redeployment of
forces conditional on Yasser Arafat's compliance with terms that
were difficult, if not impossible, to meet.
</P>
<P>
To a question on what other countries could do to help
Palestine, he said they could pressure the U.S. to announce its
initiative in order to tell the public that Israel was responsible
for the stalemate and for killing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Action should be taken later by the United Nations and
economic sanctions should be imposed on Israel, similar to that on
the apartheid regime of South Africa in the past," he said.

<HEADLINE> Dalian Port Adopts Advanced Container Management System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- An advanced computer-controled
system went into operation today at Dalian Port in northeast
China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The new system will increase the port's container management
capacity to three million TEUs from the present 200,000 TEUs.
</P>
<P>
The system, installed by the Dalian Container Terminal
Co. Ltd., a Sino-Singaporean joint venture, is part of the
company's efforts to build the port into a major shipping hub in
east Asia.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, the joint venture has opened a number
of overseas and domestic shipping routes.
</P>
<P>
In December 1997, the Maersk Line, one of the world's largest
shippers, became a shareholder in the joint venture, which
has further strengthened the company.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Dalian Container Port has four deep-water berths
capable of stockpiling 30,000 containers at a time and
handling 1.1 million TEUs annually.
</P>
<P>
A fifth container dock is expected to be added to the port,
increasing its container handling capacity to 1.5 million TEUs a
year.

<HEADLINE> Pupils In Southwestern China Discover Animal Fossils </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 20 kinds of animal fossils
discovered by primary school pupils on the outskirts of Kunming,
the capital city of southwest China's Yunnan Province, have turned
out to be an important geological find.
</P>
<P>
The story of the fossils begins in February 1997, when Li Yi, a
second grade girl at the Yunnan Teachers College's primary school,
discovered an earthworm-shaped stone on Minshan Mountain, some 20
kilometers from Kunming. Li was simply digging around with her
classmates under the guidance of their teacher, Dong Wei, who was
hoping to get them to develop an interest in nature and geology.
</P>
<P>
The stone was later identified as a fossil, and as the
schoolmates continued to dig around the following year, more
and more fossil discoveries followed.
</P>
<P>
Then, their discoveries came to the attention of scholars and
the fossils turned out to be trilobites, medusas, and 23 other
species from the early stage of the Cambrian period, more than 500
million years ago.
</P>
<P>
Similar fossils that had been found in the mid 1980s at
Chengjiang, near the Maotian Mountain, about 100 kilometers from
Kunming, came to be known as "Chengjiang animal fossils". The
discovery of these fossils were then reputed as "one of the most
amazing geological discoveries in the 20th century."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the children's discovery has not only increased the
area over which Chengjiang fossils are thought to be dispersed,
but has also revealed a number of new species that had not been
seen before, according to Jiang Zhiwen, chief engineer of the
Yunnan Provincal Geology and Mineral Department and
secretary-general of the Geology Association of Yunnan Province.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Ministerial Meeting to Open in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers from Southeast
Asian nations and their dialogue partners are starting to gather
here Monday to discuss the current regional financial crisis and
other major problems facing the region and the world as well.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis, which is still raging in the region, and
its implications on the Asian economies and those beyond the
region are focus of the 31st annual ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) Ministerial Meeting (AMM) and its related
meetings, according to Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo
Siazon.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said that the combination of the prolonged financial
crisis and other problems in the region had led many to "believe
that the region's optimism for continued economic prosperity over
the next two to three years has become ambiguous at best."
</P>
<P>
"We are witnessing what might be the most defining moment for
the post-cold war world -- a re-evaluation of current economic and
financial architectures; a new perspective on the role of major
economic powerhouses and emerging economies; and the swift
judgment of markets in the electronic global markets," Siazon
said.
</P>
<P>
At such a moment, Siazon said, the AMM and its related meetings
are an incomparable opportunity to put focus on the current
economic situation and consider its implications on the countries
within Asia, as well as those beyond the region.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming elections in Cambodia, the nuclear arms race in
South Asia and the fight against transnational crime and a
controversial flexible engagement policy are also expected to be
tackled by the ministers.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia, whose entry to ASEAN was deferred indefinitely in
July 1997 due to its political instability, will hold
parliamentary elections on July 26, which are seen vital to
restore the country's political stability.
</P>
<P>
Siazon promised earlier that the Philippines, which is holding
the rotating ASEAN chairmanship, would push an earlier acceptance
of Cambodia by the grouping if the country conducts free, fair and
honest elections.
</P>
<P>
The flexible engagement policy proposed last year by Thailand
is expected to arouse a fierce debate during the meeting. The
proposal, which has gained support from the Philippines and
Malaysia, is a turnaround of the non-intervention policy that has
been adhered to by ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, which admitted Laos and Myanmar in July 1997, also
groups the Philippines, Brunei, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore,
Malaysia, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Before the ASEAN foreign ministers meet on July 24-25, ASEAN
senior officials and the ASEAN Standing Committee will meet
separately on July 21-22 to prepare for the ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
The other two related meetings include the 5th annual ASEAN
Regional Forum (ARF) on July 27 to be attended by the nine ASEAN
members, the two ASEAN observer countries Cambodia and Papua New
Guinea, and the 10 ASEAN dialogue partners.
</P>
<P>
A post ministerial conference will be held from July 28 to 29
between the ASEAN and its 10 dialogue partners -- China, the
United States, Russia, Japan, Canada, Australia, News Zealand,
South Korea, India and the European Unions (EU).

<HEADLINE> Former Philippine President's Daughter Acquitted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A Philippine trial judge acquitted
Monday the late strongman Ferdinand Marcos' daughter Imee Marcos
of two cases of tax evasion filed by the government in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Judge Noel Teejam of the Quezon City Regional Trial Court said
in a resolution that Imee Marcos, now a congresswoman representing
a district in the northern province of Ilocos Norte, was not found
guilty beyond reasonable doubt due to insufficient evidence filed
against her.
</P>
<P>
Teejam's decision said the Bureau of Internal Revenue failed to
submit convincing proofs which would show Imee Marcos's intent to
escape payment of taxes amounting to 114,000 pesos covering fiscal
year 1985 up to 1986.
</P>
<P>
The decision said Imee Marcos, in her defense, proved that she
was in good faith since she was in Hawaii in exile together with
other members of the Marcos family, including her late father who
was ousted from power by a people's revolt in February 1986.
</P>
<P>
Imee Marcos expressed the hope that all other cases filed by
the government against her family members will be dismissed soon.
</P>
<P>
The government has accused Marcos, who had been the country's
president from 1966 to 1986, of looting some 5 billion dollars
from the economy during his 20-year rule. Marcos died in exile in
Hawaii three years after his ouster.
</P>
<P>
Marcos's widow, Imelda, and her son are still facing some 100
lawsuits before Manila courts for various alleged offenses.
</P>
<P>
The country's Supreme Court has sentenced Imelda Marcos to 12
years in jail for corruption. But Imelda is free on bail while
waiting for a decision from the high tribunal on her appeal.
</P>
<P>
Marcos's son Ferdinand Jr. was sentenced by a Manila court to a
nine-year imprisonment for tax evasion. But his case is also on
appeal and he is free on bail. The young Marcos was elected
governor of Ilocos Norte, his hometown, in the May 11 national
polls.
</P>
<P>
Imelda had tried to run for the presidency in May but later
withdrew from the race just days before the presidential elections
in favor of Joseph Estrada who won the May 11 election.
</P>
<P>
The government is now reportedly negotiating with the Marcos
family on its alleged billions of dollars of ill-gotten wealth.

DHAKA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The flood situation in Bangladesh's
northern districts deteriorated again Monday with the rise of all
major rivers in the upstream of the Brahmaputra and the Ganges
basins, the national BSS news agency reported.
</P>

The flood situation would aggravate in the next couple of days
in eight districts in the Brahmaputra basin, the FFWC added.

<P>
MAPUTO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Grain output in Mozambique's
second farming season from June to July this year will be hard
hit by drought, the national daily Noticias reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of rain in central and southern Mozambique in the
past three months would affect agriculture and animal husbandry
seriously, engineer Joana Madime of the National Agricultural
Bureau was quoted as saying here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that grain production would decrease by 30
percent this year and it would reach only 1.6 million tons.
</P>
<P>
If the rainy season would not set in recently, land leveling
work in August and seed sowing in September would be affected,
which in turn would harm the grain output next year, Madime said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior government official said
today that China will accelerate the reform of methods used in
charging certain fees.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Xiang Huaicheng said at a national fiscal
policy meeting that at present there are too many funds and fees,
seriously disturbing social distribution order and negatively
affecting the country's revenue income. He said this is the time
to standardize the system of charging these fees.
</P>
<P>
Xiang said his ministry will adopt different measures to handle
different kinds of fees and funds. Illegal or irrational fees and
funds will be abolished; fees and funds in the nature of taxes
will be replaced with relevant taxes; fees which are in line with
international practice will be retained and managed in accordance
with fiscal rules.
</P>
<P>
He said that the State Council has pinpointed transportation
and vehicle fees as a breakthrough for reforming the fee charging
system. The reform of other sectors will be gradually carried

<HEADLINE> Angolan Officials Flee Into Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LUSAKA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- At Least 138 Angolan Government
officials living in the country's eastern border towns have fled
into Zambia after being attacked by rebels of the National Union
for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
And another 13 U.N. officials and aid workers have also fled
into Zambia and they have later been driven to Lusaka for safety,
Times of Zambia reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Tehuho Muliokela, permanent secretary of
Zambia's Western Province, as confirming the development at the
weekend, saying that the affected Angolan government officials
are those operating from districts in the Mushiku and Kwanda
Kubangu provinces bordering on Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The two provinces are UNITA strongholds where the rebel
movement still controls a 400-kilometer stretch.
</P>
<P>
The 138 Angolan officials were immediately repatriated
because the Zambian government did not have facilities to cater
for them, said Muliokela.
</P>
<P>
However, another hundreds of Angolans have been allegedly
trekking into Zambia since UNITA launched a fresh offensive
earlier this months.
</P>
<P>
There have been escalating violence and threats of massacres
in the UNITA controlled provinces and the rebel movement is
massing forces in Bengo, north of the capital city of Luanda,
where they are carring out armed attacks and remining highways, a
report dispatched by Angolan News Agency said last Wednesday.

<P>
MOSCOW, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia is competing with the United
States for a Greek order for advanced air defense systems, the
Itar-Tass reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted an official of the Russian military complex as saying
that Russia has offered to supply Greece with an up-to-date air
defense system consisting of C-300PMU2 Favorit and Antei-2500
anti-aircraft missile systems.
</P>
<P>
The main competitor to the Russian system is the United States'
Patriot system.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass said though the Russian system was superior to the
U.S. one, its chance of winning the tender was 50-50 because of
political factors favorable to the Americans, such as Greece's
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) membership.
</P>
<P>
The Favorit system was five to six years ahead of Patriot while
the Antei-2500 had no match at all, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He believed the Greek military would use the Russian offer as a
bargaining chip to force down the price of the Patriot system.

<HEADLINE> Australian Coastline at Risk From Tsunamis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Australia's northwest coastline
is most at risk from tsunamis caused by earthquakes generated in
the seismic-active Indonesian region.
</P>
<P>
Tsunami researchers at the National Tidal Facility (NTF) in
Adelaide said Monday the northwest coastline had been identified
as the most vulnerable area in Australia because of its proximity
to the undersea earthquake-prone Java Trench, according to reports
by the Australian Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
The NTF has joined forces with the Bureau of Meteorology to
develop an Australian Tsunami Warning System which would alert
authorities to a pending tsunami.
</P>
<P>
The system would use seismological information from Australian
Geological Survey Organization and sea level data from NTF to
predict where a tsunami - a tidal wave caused by an earthquake -
would hit and how much damage it would cause.
</P>
<P>
NTF research assistant James Chittleborough said the NTF was
simulating tsunamis to determine which areas of the Australian
coast were most at risk and to develop a model which would be used
in the warning system.
</P>
<P>
The research involves a computer program known as a
hydrodynamical model which simulates water movement in a given
region using the governing laws of physics.
</P>
<P>
Chittleborough said the NTF would also use data from the
tsunamis which wiped out villages on the remote northwest coast of
Papua New Guinea Friday night, killing more than 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
"It's a seismically active zone (around the Java Trench) so
that poses the most risk ... we've got tremors that occur fairly
often there," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bureau of Meteorology marine and oceanography services national
coordinator Phil Parker said the Australian Tsunami Warning System
could be in operation within a year if the agencies received the
necessary funding to finalize their research.
</P>
<P>
Parker said tsunamis could occur at any time and it was
important for people involved in the warning system to be
well-prepared.
</P>
<P>
"It's got to be something that people follow every day because
these can happen at any moment," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province, China's
largest exporter, registered a 10.7 percent growth in export
during the first half of this year despite the Asian financial
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Its total exports in the period amounted to 36.87 billion US
dollars. The financial crisis had considerably affected the
province's foreign trade sector. However, Guangdong still
maintained a rapid growth thanks to the increase of its economic
strength and competitive products, industry insiders said.
</P>
<P>
The province contributed more than 40 percent to the national
total exports in the six month period. Foreign trade also boosted
its GDP growth, which was 9.2 percent higher than that of the 1997
period.
</P>
<P>
And, the province adopted a series of measures to stimulate
domestic market demand. It injected more than 81 billion yuan in
fixed asset investment, and recorded over 114 billion yuan in
value added industrial output, up 11.2 percent and 10.2 percent,
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians: One-Week Deadline for Renewed Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian officials have given
a one-week deadline for the renewed direct talks with Israel,
saying they do not want the talks to be prolonged if no progress
is made, Israel Radio reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, cited by the radio,
said the Israelis did not bring any "substantial proposals" to the
meeting held Sunday night between Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai and Palestinian National Authority Deputy Chairman
Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen).
</P>
<P>
No progress was made at the meeting, Erekat said, hinting that
whatever the result or even without a result, the Palestinians
want to finish the talks in a week.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from their three-hour-long meeting in Tel Aviv,
Mordechai and Abbas said late Sunday night that the Israeli and
Palestinian teams agreed to meet in the coming days to resolving
contentious issues blocking the overdue West Bank pullback.
</P>
<P>
This was the first senior, public direct talks between Israel
and the Palestinians since March last year when Israel broke
ground for a controversial Jewish settlement in the Arab East
Jerusalem, precipitating the negotiation to a halt.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have recently called for a resumption of the
direct talks after they failed to persuade Israel to accept their
proposal calling on Israel to withdraw from an additional 13.1
percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Among the key issues discussed at Sunday night's talks were
Israel's demand to place special restrictions on 3 percent of the
13 percent to be yielded to the Palestinians, and the issue of
reconvening the Palestinian National Council to annul clauses in
the Palestinian Covenant calling for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Dahlan, head of the Palestinian General Security
Service and a member of the Palestinian team, said the Israeli
delegation had even refused to discuss the U.S. proposal.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever the Palestinians brought up the U.S. initiative, the
Israelis would say 'not yet'," he said after the meeting Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to Erekat's remarks, Director-General of the Israeli
Prime Minister's Office Moshe Leon was quoted by Israel Radio as
saying that progress had been made at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
There is a good chance for the talks to end up in an agreement,
he said. But he did not elaborate.

<HEADLINE> Bill on Malaysian MSC Development Tabled in Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Communications and
Multimedia Bill 1998, a single legislation to support the
country's efforts to develop the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC),
was tabled in the House of Representatives here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Energy, Telecommunications and Posts Minister Leo Moggie said
the bill was aimed at achieving the objectives of making Malaysia
a regional communication hub and evolving an information-savvy
society, according to the Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that with the bill, Malaysia would emerge as
a pioneer country in implementing a comprehensive policy structure
to handle the convergence process in the telecommunications,
computer and broadcasting sectors.
</P>
<P>
The convergence process involving the three sectors was a
global phenomenon and a current development trend, he said. Hence,
a comprehensive policy and regulatory framework needed to be
created to spearhead the development of the convergence process.
</P>
<P>
The policy framework was needed to ensure transparency and
consistency in enhancing the understanding of interested parties
of the convergence technology and of development efforts in the
communications and multimedia sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
The framework was also needed to encourage the development of
the communications and multimedia industry as an important base
for the country's economic and social development, he said.
</P>
<P>
It was also to safeguard the interests of consumers in terms of
service quality and costs, to ensure information security and
network reliability and to create healthy competition and a more
organized market, he added.
</P>
<P>
The bill was drafted generic or general in nature so that its
scope would be wider for adoption without having to make
amendments everytime there was a change in technology.
</P>
<P>
Special provisions have been drafted only for certain
situations to handle specific issues like regulation, competition
and the dominant operator in the market.
</P>
<P>
Among the main principles taken into account in preparing the
bill was the reduction of restrictive regulations by allowing
flexibility in decision-making so that the communications and
multimedia industry that emerged would be a self-disciplined
industry, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The bill also provided for the establishment of a single
regulatory body with autonomous powers on finance and management.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that with the formulation of the bill, the
Telecommunications Act 1950 and Broadcasting Act 1988 in the
country were repealed.

<HEADLINE> NZ Government cuts 163 Million US Dollars in Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley announced after a cabinet meeting on Monday that her
government decided to cut another 315 million N.Z. dollars (163
million U.S. dollars) in spending to "reinforce the government's
surplus and help New Zealand to build on the gains of the past
decade."
</P>
<P>
This is the second reduction in government expenditure. The
first one was 300 million N.Z. dollars (156 million U.S. dollars),
which was announced in the 1998 budget.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that before Monday's announcement, the New
Zealand Prime Minister ordered a review of all government
spending after a string of bad economic news last month, and said
any money not already spent by the government was under scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
Shipley said here Monday that the reductions of government
expenditure were a response to "Asian economic situation."
</P>
<P>
"In the short term the downturn in Asia is reducing New
Zealand's growth rate and the tax revenue which the government had
previously expected. The savings announced today will help buffer
the government against this loss of income," she said.
</P>
<P>
Shipley said that her government will review whether further
steps are needed to ensure that New Zealand's interests are
protected.
</P>
<P>
"The government will continue to closely monitor the global
impact of the Asian economic situation," she said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Shipley disclosed that for the 12-month period to
May 1998, New Zealand's exports to the main Asian economies
decreased by 402 million N.Z. dollars (209 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Armed Squads to Fight Piracy in E. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Armed mercenaries led by Kenyan
Defense Ministry personnel and former British special forces
would focus on the east African coast to help fight piracy,
according to a recent report in Lloyd's List.
</P>
<P>
The rapid response squads, which are managed by the
Swiss-based Marine Risk Management Group, can move into action
anywhere in the region within 24 hours, the East African weekly
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
They are part of a comprehensive counter-piracy program known
as Maritime Asset Recovery and Protection recently launched in
London, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The Somali coastline has become increasingly dangerous, with
frequent pirate attacks by people believed to be members of the
warring military factions controlling different parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Kenya and Tanzania have also reported isolated cases of pirate
attacks on ships in their territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
A Mombasa-based shipping agent welcomed the move, saying it
was the best way to counter the Somali gangs. He said his
principals had spent a lot of money securing safe passage for
their ships and crew between Somali ports.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Tanzania Harbors Authority said it had
stepped up surveillance in its coastal waters to curb piracy.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Ports Authority also announced it was boosting police
patrol within its waters after several anchored cargo ships were
attacked.

<HEADLINE> Natural Disasters In Northwestern Chinese Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The prevalence of natural disasters
in northwest China's Qinghai province this summer has meant havoc
for people's lives and property.
</P>
<P>
A teenager in Huzhu County was killed by lightning in May while
he was playing under a big tree. Two of his friends were thrown
away more than 10 meters by the jolt and a dog was cut in half.
</P>
<P>
The same storm caused a freak disaster for more than 30
families when they saw sparks in their courtyards and rooms and a
dozen TV sets exploded, witnesses say.
</P>
<P>
On June 7, three farmers in Minhe County received serious burns
when lightning struck a field where they were having their
meal. All had to be hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
Hailstorms hit fourteen of the province's counties, affecting
nearly 30,000 hectares of crops and 160,000 people's lives. As if
that weren't enough, locusts and caterpillars attacked more than
900,000 ha of grassland this summer, threatening the lives of
animals.
</P>
<P>
These phenomena have mainly been attributed to El Nino, local
authorities said, and the provincial government is trying to deal
with the disaster.

<HEADLINE> Marine Salvage Vessel Averts Sea Perils off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A marine salvage company based in
Kenya's Indian Ocean port Mombasa has averted oil spill and other
perils at rough sea off the Somali coast this month, after towing
ashore an oil tanker that had broken down there.
</P>
<P>
The East African weekly Monday quoted shipping sources as
saying that the tanker, mv Joey, carrying 10,500 tons of fuel
from the Middle East, was heading for Mombasa when it developed
engine problems at sea last month.
</P>
<P>
Murri International's tug-boat, Barbara, towed the drifting
vessel ashore on June 29 for repair, according to the press
report.
</P>
<P>
Shipping sources said the spot where the tanker was salvaged
is dangerous in July, which marks the beginning of the monsoon
season that is characterized by strong winds which create high
waves in the area.
</P>
<P>
Two cargo vessels had reportedly capsized in strong winds in
the same area while a third one was being refloated earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Yemen Ports Authority also reported that a
general cargo ship loaded with construction material and 3,000
tons of flour ran around in the same area after high winds rammed
it into a breakwater.
</P>
<P>
In June, a Syrian-registered vessel, mv Alimad, carrying 3,800
tons of cement from Saudi Arabia, capsized and sank near the same
spot. All the 30 crew members were rescued by a passing vessel.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Government Committed to Tackling Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region will make sustained efforts to
tackle unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The figures released by the Census and Statistics Department
here Monday show that the provisional seasonally adjusted
unemployment rate for the period of April to June this year was
4.5 percent and the provisional underemployment rate was 2.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate for the period of March to May this year
was 4.1 percent. The increase in unemployment occurred mainly in
the retail, restaurants and construction sectors while the
unemployment situation in the other major sectors was relatively
more stable.
</P>
<P>
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said that he was deeply
concerned about the rise in unemployment rate, and was acutely
aware of the difficulties facing the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
"However, we must not lose heart. Our fiscal, foreign exchange,
banking and corporate fundamentals are strong and employment
prospects remain positive. I am sure that we shall pull through
and emerge even more competitive and robust," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the series of measures to ease unemployment
announced recently by the Task Force on Employment are also taking
effect.
</P>
<P>
Some measures have been fully implemented, such as
strengthening the Labor Department's Job Matching Program, and
providing a telephone job matching service and vacancy processing
service for job-seekers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said: "the government has already advanced 12 public
works projects which would lead to the early creation of some
1,600 jobs. These projects and investment programs are on course."
</P>
<P>
"We are actively considering the possibility of expediting some
more infrastructural projects so that more job opportunities will
be available earlier," he added.

<HEADLINE> Tung Chee Hwa Inspects Hong Kong New Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's top leader Tung Chee
Hwa inspected the new international airport at Chek Lap Kok
on Monday, two weeks after it went into commercial operation.
</P>
<P>
Tung, Chief Executive of the Special Administrative Region
(SAR), Monday visited the passenger terminal building and two air
cargo terminals -- one run by the Asian Airfreight Terminal Ltd.,
and the other, Super Terminal One, operated by the Hong Kong Air
Cargo Terminal Ltd. (HACTL).
</P>
<P>
The chief executive told a press conference after his two-hour
tour that tremendous progress had been made on the passenger
services, yet much had to be done to improve the cargo operations.
</P>
<P>
"I have every confidence that Hong Kong airport, in a very,
very near future, will be recognized internationally as one of the
best airports in the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that by the eighth day, the standard of the passenger
services at the new airport had surpassed that of the Kai Tak
airport. Now the around-the-clock airport handles 480 flights and
90,000 passengers a day.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Airport Authority (AA), which oversees the
day-to-day operation of the new airport, said that the majority of
flights left within 30 minutes of schedule, and on average
passengers need to wait 18 minutes to reclaim their baggage --
either meeting or exceeding Kai Tak standards.
</P>
<P>
But cargo operations were affected due to the breakdown of the
Super Terminal One, which handles 80 percent of the total air
cargo in Hong Kong. The franchisee HACTL has planned to gear up
the throughput at the terminal step by step till it runs in full
strength in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
Super Terminal One handled some 3,000 tons of goods Sunday,
hitting its first-phase target to resume 50-percent capacity.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that his government had been following what was going
on at the new airport "with a great deal of anxiety and a great
deal of attention" since it was opened on July 6.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive said the government would soon nominate a
special commission to make an independent and full investigation
into the issues that emerged in the operation of the new airport.
He also appealed to public support for the efforts made by all
parties concerned in solving the problems as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Tung was accompanied by Administrative
Secretary Anson Chan, Chairman of the AA Wong Po-yan, and other
SAR officials.

<HEADLINE> Year 2000 Problem Solution Show Organized in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A three-day exhibition organized
by the Hong Kong Productivity Council (HKPC) opened here Monday to
provide Year 2000 problem (Y2K) solutions to small and
medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Thomas Tang, executive
director of HKPC, said: "One year after an HKPC survey that
revealed most companies were not aware of the seriousness of the
imminent problem, some of them still lack a sense of crisis."
</P>
<P>
"If we are not going to deal with the problem properly, its
impact could multiply under a chain effect, because of the
interplay between small and medium-sized enterprises, banks,
factories, suppliers and public utilities," Tang warned.
</P>
<P>
Tang urged an early completion of the Y2K rectification before
the year 2000 so as to allow sufficient time for an integrated
test by experts.
</P>
<P>
The Year 2000 Problem, also known as the Millennium Bug, occurs
because the computer system records years with the last two digits
rather than four, e.g. using "98" instead of "1998". As a result,
the computer system may not be able to distinguish "2000" from
"1900" when the new millennium arrives. The system may then lose
data processing functions that are vital to business operation.
</P>
<P>
The show provided a forum to major Y2K solution providers to
showcase their products and services. A series of seminars were
held concurrently with the show.
</P>
<P>
To enhance public awareness on the problem and to urge for
prompt action, HKPC has launched a services center to provide
affordable solutions to small and medium-sized enterprises which
form the backbone of Hong Kong economy and set up a hotline to
answer inquiries.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Increases Foreign Firms' Equity Percentage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia announced Monday
that from the day onwards, foreign companies' equity in the trade
sector, particularly wholesale and retail trade, could be 51
percent against the previous 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Megat Junid
Megat Ayob said Monday that in certain cases foreign firms were
allowed to hold up to 100 percent equity if Malaysia was made the
distribution center for the product.
</P>
<P>
The government's move is aimed at enabling more foreign
industrialists to invest in the sector, he told reporters after
chairing a dialogue here between his ministry and the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
Megat Junid said the cabinet had directed that the equity ratio
be revised as the country wanted to be more liberal towards the
companies particularly those involved in export-oriented
industries.
</P>
<P>
He said that now with this relaxation, it is likely many
foreign investors will want to inject more capital into companies
in Malaysia.

MANILA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Two security guards were killed
Monday morning in what appeared to be a failed attempt to rob an
armored van containing more than 10 million pesos (244,000 U.S.
dollars) in a Manila suburb.
</P>
<P>
The two victims died on the armored van in a street in Caloocan

Senior Superintendent Samuel Pagdilao, the city's police chief.
</P>
<P>
He said police suspect the incident was a handiwork of
professionals.
</P>
<P>
The modus operandi used by the suspects were similar to
previous armored van robberies elsewhere in Metro Manila, Pagdilao
said.
</P>
<P>
Pagdilao said that a police team managed to quickly respond to
the incident, preventing the suspects from escaping with the
contents of the armored Van.
</P>
<P>
He added that the responding team traded shots with the
suspects who managed to escape towards Manila on board a car.
</P>
<P>
The local police are now coordinating with other police
agencies in Metro Manila to try to get the suspects.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Vows to Counter Threats to Turkey, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz Monday warned that Ankara will retaliate threats to the
security of Turkey and northern Cyprus, the semi-official Anatolia
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz signaled the warning upon arrival in northern Cyprus for
a one-day visit, during which he will participate a ceremony to
mark the 24th anniversary of Turkey's military intervention on the
divided Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of
Cyprus in 1974 after a failed coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking
union with Greece. It has maintained some 40,000 troops here with
the claimed aim to protect the Turkish Cypriot minority.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz said that he will evaluate the recent situation on the
island with Turkish Cypriot leaders Rauf Denktash and Dervis
Eroglu.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 a breakaway
Turkish republic recognized only by Ankara, against the
internationally acknowledged Republic of Cyprus dominated by the
Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz said the Cypriot government has considered its accession
talks with the European Union (EU) as a green-light for every
action to increase "activities to provoke tension on Cyprus and in
the region, upsetting the security, stability and balances there."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus started the entry talks with the EU last March.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish prime minister stressed that such moves as possible
deployment of anti-aircraft missiles, building air and naval bases
for Greece and heavy armament efforts in Cyprus show that "Greece
and the Greek Cypriot side did not learn lessons from the history."
</P>
<P>
These adventurous steps are "dangerous and wrong," Yilmaz said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed a deal with Russia early last year to buy S-300
surface-to-air missiles in a bid to boost defense. The move has
angered the Turkish Cypriots and Turkey, which has threatened to
launch preemptive actions to destroy the missiles if deployed.

<HEADLINE> New Seed Technology Threatens 3rd World: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A technique that disables a
seed's ability to germinate when planted was widely criticized by
experts as it could spell doom to agriculture in the developing
world, the East African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The technique, known as terminator technology, has been
developed and patented by the U.S.-based Delta and Pine Land
Company and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). It is
expected to be on the market after 2000.
</P>
<P>
An official at the Kenya Agricultural Research Center (KARI),
expressed shock at the revelation, saying it was outrageous to
develop such a technology.
</P>
<P>
Although KARI generally discourages farmers from planting
saved up seeds due to low quality yields, he said, forcing them
to buy seeds every season would mean that those who cannot afford
to will not plant.
</P>
<P>
The technology which is also known as the millennium seed,
targets all plants, especially rice, wheat, sorghum and soya
beans, the world's main staple crops.
</P>
<P>
Hope Shand, a research director with the Rural Advancement
Foundation International (RAFI) which is a Canadian
non-governmental organization, has also described the technology
as "dangerous."
</P>
<P>
"Half of the world's population is poor. They provide food for
more than one billion people and they can't afford to buy seeds
every season, therefore, seed collection is vital to them," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The East African report said the technology has been condemned
by many Third World countries, with Camilla Montecinos of the
Chile-based Center of Education (CET) calling for a global
boycott.
</P>
<P>
Seeds treated with the technology can infect those that have
not. The plants will not be affected that season but the seeds
derived from the crop will be sterile, experts say.
</P>
<P>
However, Melvin Oliver, a USDA scientist, argued that the
creation of the technique is necessary to come up with a system
that allowed inventors to protect their work without recourse to
the law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, chief of the Nairobi-based U.N. Environment Program
Klaus Topfer was quoted as warning that competition for dwindling
biological resources could become a source of national and
international strife.

SHENZHEN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Huangtian International Airport
in the city of Shenzhen in Guangdong Province has reduced its
prices for 24-hour assistance for Hong Kong's air freight problems
at its new airport.
</P>
<P>
It has temporarily cut the cost of fuel and landing, which was
previously higher than in Hong Kong, in a gesture of
goodwill. Cargo handling and service charges at the Shenzhen
airport have been lower than those in Hong Kong, so the general
cost is now 30 percent lower than in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Another change is that foreign flight crews of cargo planes
bound for Hong Kong will not need entry or exit visas when
transiting the Shenzhen Airport.
</P>
<P>
The freight handling difficulties at Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok
Airport began just after it opened on July 6.
</P>
<P>
The first foreign cargo plane, one from Korean Airlines, is
expected to arrive at Shenzhen airport on July 23.

CANBERRA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar lost ground

<P>
At the close the Australian dollar was trading at 62.45 U.S.

<HEADLINE> Mandela's Wedding Covered Up for Money: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The veil of secrecy over the
wedding of President Nelson Mandela and Graca Machel was at least
partly to protect the interests of a publishing company which had
bought the rights to the story for an undisclosed amount.
</P>
<P>
The Star daily quoted a source as saying that the publishing
company was Mafube Publishing, which plans to bring out a special
publication on the wedding in two weeks' time.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's office had up until Friday denied media reports that
Mandela would tie the knot with Machel Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said Mafube's general manager Ivan Fynn Sunday night
denied the allegations, while Mandela's spokesman Parks
Mankahlana refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the way the president's office handled the
affair put its credibility in question.
</P>
<P>
"How am I supposed to believe him (Mankahlana) the next time
he tells me South Africa is not selling arms to Libya?" The Star
quoted a foreign journalist as asking.
</P>
<P>
The Star was the first to report Thursday that Mandela and
Machel would get married Saturday and stood by its story Friday.
</P>
<P>
But the president's office issued repeated denials Thursday
and Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you that the story which appeared in The Star is
not true," Mankahlana said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, he appealed to the media to discontinue the "false
rumors" that the president was to get married on Saturday and
reassured that Mandela would not tie the knot at least "in the
near future."
</P>
<P>
Johannesburg Chief Magistrate Charlton Bashe who officiated at
the wedding ceremony phoned The Star Thursday to deny that he had
been approached for the job. But he performed the official duties
at the ceremony Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the wedding Saturday afternoon, Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki admitted that he learned it about two months ago.
</P>
<P>
Asked why officials from Mandela's office had persistently
denied the story, he said: "They said they didn't know. And I am
sure they didn't know."
</P>
<P>
But that can't be true of Bashe, and it is highly unlikely
that Mankahlana would not have inquired from the president
whether The Star's story was correct, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Maputo Corridor to Boost Regional Economy: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Maputo Development
Corridor, which links South Africa and Mozambique and jointly
being built by the two countries, will remarkablely promote
economy in the region.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Business Day Monday quoted a study on the project
as saying that from the year of 2000 the corridor would have an
"important and positive effect" on tourism industry of South
Africa's Mpumalanga Province bordering with Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The corridor would also assist in fostering the infrastructure
development for the long-term job opportunities", the study said.
</P>
<P>
If there had been no corridor development, the increase in the
number of direct jobs between last year and 2005 would have been
27 percent. However, the effect of the corridor propelled the
increase in the direct jobs to more than 39 percent in the same
period.
</P>
<P>
The increase in direct jobs as a result of the corridor was
"very encouraging", the study said.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the 400-million-U.S.-Dollar corridor toll road
between Witbank, South Africa and Maputo, the capital of
Mazambique, was officially launched in the border town of Ressano
Garcia, Mozambique on June 6.
</P>
<P>
The corridor has been dubbed the largest infrastructure
project on the African continent. It was expected to be completed
in three years.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Muslim Rebels Urged to Be Sincere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine military has urged
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) to be sincere in its
peace negotiations with the government, the official Philippine
news agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Major General Rolando Bautista, chief of the Army's Sixth
Infantry Division, made the call Sunday to the Moro rebels in his
welcome address on the arrival of a battalion of marines in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The 456-strong battalion was dispatched to Maguindanao province
in central Mindanao, home to several major MILF strongholds, to
reinforce government forces there.
</P>
<P>
Skirmishes erupted anew last Thursday between government troops
and MILF forces near Buldon town in Maguindanao after some 200
MILF rebels attacked a detachment of the 37th Infantry Battalion
in the area.
</P>
<P>
The military said that at least five MILF guerrillas were
killed during the encounter while the government side has no
fatality.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Bautista instructed the Marine soldiers to
lessen their heated relationship against the MILF by way of
silencing their guns.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the government began their peace talks in January
1997 but the talks have been on-and-off due to sporadic clashes
between the MILF fighters and government troops.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the government made a major breakthrough in late
1997 by reaching a comprehensive ceasefire agreement covering the
entire Mindanao region. But the truce has been often violated.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, which deferred its scheduled next round of peace
talks with the government before the May 11 presidential
elections, is expected to resume its talks with the new
administration.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a splinter group of the mainstream Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF), is the strongest anti-government force in
the country, with an estimated membership of 12,000.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF signed a peace treaty with the government in September
1996, putting an end to more than three decades of the group's
secessionist movement in Mindanao.

<HEADLINE> Australia Would Do All It Could to Help PNG: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard said Monday Australia would do all it could to help Papua
New Guinea (PNG) recover from the devastating tidal wave which at
least left 600 dead and 6,000 homeless.
</P>
<P>
"As a country, as a close friend and neighbor and helper we
will do all we can to help the very unfortunate people of this
country," the prime minister told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer also told
reporters that Australia would do whatever it takes to help
restore the livelihood of the people devastated by the tidal wave.
</P>
<P>
Downer said Australia would need to provide medium to long-term
assistance for PNG, which was once administered by Australia
before PNG's independence in 1975.
</P>
<P>
He added Australia had committed about 300,000 U.S. dollars in
its initial reaction to the tragedy providing food, clothing and
medical aid.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said the money spent on the relief effort
was separate to the aid budget allocated to PNG of about 200
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Defense Force Monday set up a field hospital
near the PNG town of Vanimo and helped feed homeless victims.
</P>
<P>
Australian Defense Department Spokesman Colonel Keith Jobson
said Vanimo was 80 km from the wave-affected area, but many
injured had already been evacuated by helicopter to the town.
</P>
<P>
Three Royal Australian Air Force C130 Hercules aircraft loaded
with medical supplies and food arrived in PNG early Monday to
assist thousands of people left homeless and injured by Friday's
catastrophic tsunami.
</P>
<P>
Jobson said up to 700 people had been buried and hundreds of
people were injured, mostly with multiple fractures.
</P>
<P>
Ten-meter-high waves, triggered by two powerful undersea
earthquakes, crashed into a 30-km stretch of PNG's north coast on
Friday, wiping out seven heavily populated villages.

<HEADLINE> Aid Agencies Seek Funds to Rebuild Afghan Villages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 20 (Xinhua) -- International aid agencies have
appealed for more funds to help about 200,000 earthquake victims
in northern Afghanistan to rebuild their villages.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and the International Committee for the Red
Cross (ICRC) have completed their emergency operation in response
to the May 30 earthquake in Afghanistan's northeastern Badakshan,
according to a U.N. press release here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
International agencies, coordinated by the U.N., have now begun
a rehabilitation phase aimed at providing enough housing
assistance so that the 167,000 earthquake victims can secure
shelters before the winter arrives.
</P>
<P>
However, at least 30 villages on the more heavily damaged east
side of the earthquake zone in Badakshan province are inaccessible
by road, and the U.N. estimates that at least one million U.S.
dollars are needed to help them to survive the winter.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake, which measured 6.9 on the Richter scale and was
the second to hit the area this year, killed some 4,000 people,
destroyed 17,000 houses and affected 127 villages.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has spent 2.6 million dollars on the emergency
operation. However, a 6.8-million-dollar emergency appeal launched
in June, failed to elicit any response.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six weeks, the U.N. and ICRC delivered 1,500
metric tons of food. They also distributed 17,000 tents and
tarpaulins and 76,000 blankets, as well as cooking and washing
implements, soaps, used clothes and plastic sheeting.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Russia Issue Stands on Caspian, Tajikistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Russia have issued two
joint statements clarifying their stands on the Caspian Sea and
the peace process in Tajikistan, the official news agency IRNA
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two statements were inked Sunday night by Iranian Deputy
Foreign Minister Morteza Sarmadi and his Russian counterpart Boris
Pastukhov, who arrived here Friday to explain Moscow's stances on
the Caspian.
</P>
<P>
The two countries stressed in the first statement that a legal
regime of the Caspian has to be determined through the consensus
of the five littoral states, which also include Kazakhstan,
Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
They ruled out interference by any outside parties, as a
mediator or else, in drawing up the legal regime.
</P>
<P>
They said the 1921 and 1940 agreements signed by Tehran and
Moscow on joint ownership of the Caspian waters and resources
stand valid until the new regime is worked out.
</P>
<P>
They called for accelerating activities of working groups
consisting of deputy foreign ministers of the five states
bordering the Caspian for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Iran and Russia support equal partition of
the seabed among the bordering states, but did not reach a
consensus on how the sea resources should be utilized by the
countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Russia had espoused common ownership because reported
oil and gas reserves fall near the shores of the independent
republics of former Soviet Union. But lately Russia agreed to
a division after reportedly receiving promise of compensation and
left Iran an odd man out.
</P>
<P>
The options are a partition of both the water and the subsea
resources, and a division of the seabed while the water is left as
a common resource.
</P>
<P>
The two countries underlined the need to protect the Caspian
environment and strongly opposed the transfer of oil and gas
through subsea pipelines.
</P>
<P>
In a second statement, Tehran and Moscow assessed as "fragile"
the situation in Tajikistan where the government and opposition
have been locked in a six-year-old civil war and expressed concern
over the delay in implementing the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Both called for genuine efforts by the two sides to the
conflict to make the peace accord a success, reiterating their
commitment to peace efforts and subsequently reconstruction in the
war-torn Central Asian country.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Russia also cautioned against any interference in the
Tajik internal affairs by other countries.

<HEADLINE> India, U.S. Begin Third Round of Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- India and the United States
began their third round of tough talks on nuclear
non-proliferation and disarmament here Monday morning on a
cautious note.
</P>
<P>
The six-member U.S. delegation led by Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott arrived here Sunday evening amidst tight security.
</P>
<P>
It is significant that the talks come ten days before the
planned crucial meeting between Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on the
sidelines of the three-day summit of the South Asian Association
for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in Colombo beginning on July 29.
</P>
<P>
Talbott is the first high-ranking U.S. official to visit the
South Asian country since India conducted nuclear tests in May.
</P>
<P>
His first two rounds of talks with Indian Prime Minister's
special envoy Jaswant Singh -- in Washington on June 12 and in
Frankfurt on July 9 -- reached no concrete results with New Delhi
asserting that its demand for building a nuclear deterrent was not
negotiable.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi made it clear that there was no question of rolling
back or freezing its weaponization program and it would not sign
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) as its present form while
Washington insisted on the immediate and unconditional signing of
the CTBT by India and refraining from deploying nuclear weapons or
advanced missile systems in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, it is not unreasonable to count on a measure of
progress with each round of talks between Talbott and Jaswant
Singh, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission though both
sides disclosed little of the talks.
</P>
<P>
The three meetings between the two officials were planned in a
quick succession, the very fact of which is seen here as speaking
itself.
</P>
<P>
Both Talbott and Singh posed for photographs this morning
before their talks but declined to answer any questions from
waiting reporters.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said that the United States was in a mood to
settle its problems with India that had cropped up in the wake of
the nuclear tests by the Indian government led by Bharatiya Janata
Party.
</P>
<P>
Both sides were reportedly keen on improving the bilateral
relations so as to save the plans of President Bill Clinton to
visit South Asian countries later this year.
</P>
<P>
And India is eager to get rid of the economic sanctions imposed
especially by the U.S. The sanctions have began to hit the country
which is badly in need of foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
Talbott is scheduled to call on Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee, former prime minister I. K. Gujral, Home Minister L. K.
Advani and other Indian high officials.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation, which is scheduled to leave for Islamabad
Tuesday, includes Deputy Assistant Secretary for Non-Proliferation
Robert Einhorn, senior adviser in the National Security Council
Bruce Riedel, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph
Ralston, Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs Karl
Inderfurth and U.S. Ambassador to India Richard Celeste.

<HEADLINE> China's Tea Business Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Tea is becoming increasingly
popular all over the world, but in China, its home, there are
signs of sluggishness in the business.
</P>
<P>
Annual tea output fell to some 400,000 tons last year from a
record high of 800,000 tons, according to the Ministry of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
A recent quality inspection by the State Bureau of
Technological Supervision at 59 large tea stores in Beijing,
Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Zhengzhou and Hangzhou show that
only 35.9 percent of the tea met quality standards.
</P>
<P>
The people in charge of the industry are being blamed for
getting themselves in a rut. Analysts say that China now only has
solid tea, but other countries have many kinds of tea products
like tea milk, tea beer and other beverages.
</P>
<P>
Tea exports accounted for a tenth of China's total exports in
the 1950s, but tea has plummeted to only 0.1 percent of the total
in the 1990s, and tea's share of the international market has also
dropped sharply, according to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Kenya, Tanzania to Reduce Tampering with Cargo at </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenya and Tanzania are planning
to introduce a U.N.-designed transport logistics information
system in Mombasa and Dar es Salaam in attempts against tampering
with cargo in the two leading Indian Ocean ports in east Africa.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to greatly reduce diversion and pilferage
of cargo there, the East African regional weekly newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The new method, which aims to reduce errors and delays when
transmitting and receiving information, is cost-effective, Rashid
Marwan, Operations Controller of the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA),
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The system is known as ACIS port system or PortTracker. ACIS
is a generic name for a set of computer applications for
generating management information for multi-modal cargo transit
and transport problems.
</P>
<P>
Each application is independent but is designed in such a way
that it allows free exchange of data in the shipping industry.
</P>
<P>
The system contains four basic software modules.
</P>
<P>
The Ship Call sub-module, which covers each step of a ship's
call, can be assimilated into the harbor master function, from
boarding of the pilot to mobilization of tug-boats, pilots and
mooring gangs, to berthing and subsequent occupation of quay.
</P>
<P>
Then there is the Cargo Handling sub-module for preliminary
assignment of gangs and handling equipment. It monitors these
operations, producing time sheets and shift reports on
utilization and availability of cranes, forklifts and so on.
</P>
<P>
The Cargo Transfer Management sub-module includes the manifest
transfer system, which enables ship-owners, brokers and shippers
to transmit manifest data across borders using the U.N. standard
manifest message.
</P>
<P>
This sub-module also covers the management of cargo from
receipt to storage or warehousing and on to gate delivery/pass or
loading.
</P>
<P>
The fourth is a Container Terminal sub-module, an inventory
control system that monitors container movements and handling
operations from ship to delivery or vice versa, and, where
appropriate, stripping or stuffing.
</P>
<P>
Each basic sub-module integrates three vital functions,
namely, port billing to client, port statistics and performance
indicators, all based on the information provided by the system.

<HEADLINE> Museveni Writes to LRA Rebels for Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has written to Joseph Kony, the head of Lord Resistance Army
(LRA) active in north Uganda, saying he is ready to end the
conflict through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
A New Vision report said Monday that Minister of State for
northern reconstruction Alphonse Owiny-Dollo broke the news over
the weekend to delegates to an Acholi security conference in
London, but it did not say when the letter was written.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Museveni reportedly said he was willing to talk
peace but it was up to the Acholi victims to pardon the authors
of crime, namely: Josephy Kony, Alex Otti-Lagony and Vincent
Otti.
</P>
<P>
So it is not the Ugandan government but the LRA and a few
"armchair" rebels in London who are obstacles to peace in Acholi,
a northern district.
</P>
<P>
This is a sharp turn of the president's attitude toward the
rebels active in the north. Previously, he had made several
public statements saying he would not talk with rebels and would
wipe them out by force.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Kony spearheading several hundreds of LRA rebels
entered northern Uganda to abduct and loot for two months before
retreating to their base in southern Sudan and rising insecurity
has hit the government's top agenda.
</P>
<P>
The government has built a heavy military presence in northern
district to pursue the rebels and protect local people. But the
north is still not safe as expected.
</P>
<P>
So there is now an increasing outcry from many people
including some members of Parliament for the government to
terminate the northern conflict at the negotiating table.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Meteorologists Alert over Food Scarcity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigerians meteorologists have
warned of a drop in this year's agricultural yield and a probable
food scarcity next year owing to the current lack of rainfall in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The average statistics of rainfall for January to June
released at the weekend showed that the volume was below normal
for most of the western parts of the country. Those for the north
and east were normal.
</P>
<P>
However, while it is obvious that the west will be most
adversely affected, there is no guarantee that the effect of
other climatic parameters, intensity of rainfall and duration may
not affect the east and the north, the Guardian reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
An added danger is the depletion of the nation's water
resources which a recent scientific workshop blamed on the
unusual rise in temperature and the drastic reduction in
rainfall.
</P>
<P>
Scientists and meteorologists also blamed the negative trends
on the gradual but noticeable changes in the country's climate.
</P>
<P>
Such trends include the lowering of water levels in internal
water bodies, the persistent drought in the northern part of the
country, sea level rise and coastal erosion, as well as the
consequently steady depletion of the nation's water resources.
</P>
<P>
The high temperature recorded this year throughout the country
would also contribute to the decrease in national agricultural
scarcity.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Seeks S. African Mediation on Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has asked South
Africa to mediate in discussions on the status of Kashmir, an
area claimed by both India and Pakistan, The Star daily reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mian Abdul Waheed, chairman of Pakistan's parliamentary
standing committee on foreign affairs, met with South African
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki late last week to discuss the
disputed territory, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the talks as "friendly and cordial", Waheed said
the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) conference to be held in Durban
later this year would probably discuss the Kashmir issue, in
particular the nuclear proliferation on the Indian sub-continent.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan believes that the situation in Kashmir is the real
reason behind India's nuclear tests in May.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa has offered to send a delegation to mediate on
the Kashmir issue and although Pakistan is ready to discuss it,
it appears that India is not. India says there is no dispute,"
Waheed said.
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping that the incoming president of the NAM,
President Nelson Mandela, with his moral authority resulting from
his own experiences, is not be overpowered by the might of
India."

<HEADLINE> Corruption Reporting Network Receives 1.5 Million Alerts in Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) - China's network that encourages
pubic participation in the anti-corruption drive has had 1.47
million reports in 10 years, the Supreme People's Procuratorate's
deputy procurator-general, Zhang Qiong, said here today.
</P>
<P>
The information was mainly about officials and government
employees taking bribes, embezzlement, misappropriation of public
funds, dereliction of duty, and violating people's rights, Zhang
said.
</P>
<P>
The first corruption reporting center opened in Guangdong
Province's Shenzhen in 1988. Since then, 3,600 have opened across
the country, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The public have provided roughly 80 percent of the clues on
corruption cases handled by the prosecutors that involved 6,100
officials at or above the county level and 174,000 instances
involving 100,000 yuan each. Also, 61,000 offenders have had to
deal with judicial departments including 42,000 accused of taking
bribes and embezzlement, Zhang says.
</P>
<P>
More than a million cases fell within the scope of prosecutors
offices, who investigated 642,000, with bribery and embezzlement
accounting for 359,000, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The system protects informants from possible attempts at
revenge and procuratorates have awarded 10 million yuan to 120,000
people for information that led to uncovering crimes.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin has been calling for the
judiciary to rely on the public in the anti-corruption campaign,
and has asked procuratorates to get the public to join in the
crime reporting.
</P>
<P>
Procuratorates across the country will begin a nationwide
publicity campaign on reporting crimes to seek more help from the
public.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Thai Foreign Ministers Hold Talks in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- China is willing to work with
Thailand to push forward bilateral ties to a new height and bring
a more friendly and closer bilateral relationship into the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan made the remark during
talks with his Thai counterpart Surin Pitsuwan today.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two foreign ministers reviewed the
development of Sino-Thai relations in recent years and expressed
satisfaction with the enhancement of such relations between the
two countries in all spheres.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that joint efforts have enabled bilateral relations
to enter a mature period of all-round development. "There does not
exist any conflict of fundamental interests between China and
Thailand, nor any pending issue left over from history, nor any
hurdle to the promotion of bilateral cooperation," said the
Chinese foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Surin agreed with Tang's assessment and anticipation of
Sino-Thai relations, saying that such a bilateral relationship has
served as a typical example for the peaceful co-existence between
countries with different social systems.
</P>
<P>
He said that the further development of bilateral relations
accords with the common interests of the people of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Tang and Surin also discussed the signing of a bilateral
document on cooperation in the 21st century. They reached
consensus on major clauses and contents of the document. They
believed the document should be a "guideline document" for the
Sino-Thai relationship oriented with the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
They instructed the two foreign ministries' officials to
promptly consult on the issue so as to finalize the "far-reaching"
work at an early date.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers also discussed political, security and
economic situation in Asia and reached a wide-ranging consensus.
</P>
<P>
Surin spoke highly of China's positive role in maintaining
peace and development in the region. He also thanked China, as a
responsible country, for its great contributions to mitigating
financial crisis in East Asia.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Crack down on Money Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)
is preparing to abolish bearer financial instruments such as
Certificates of Deposits (CDs) and bonds in an effort to plug
loopholes for money laundering, corruption and fraud.
</P>
<P>
The move is also aimed at stemming the flow of drugs through
Kenya's coastal belt, the East African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has also announced measures to
strengthen CBK's capacity to enforce regulations on more open
customer disclosure by commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Discussions on the new measures, which are understood to be at
an advanced stage, are aimed at addressing international concerns
at the increasing use of African countries as centers for money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
According to Interpol sources, Kenya, South Africa and Zambia
have been identified as favorite transit drop points for drugs
from the Asia continent destined for the U.S. and European
markets.
</P>
<P>
It is partly to address these concerns that Kenya is becoming
a target of global racketeers seeking to "wash" their earnings
that the government has come up with the new requirements, which
are geared at tightening up the country's financial system.
</P>
<P>
Holders of the CDs and bonds will be given until next June to
liquidate them. New rules on the opening of new bank accounts
which were scrapped on September 29,1995, barely two days after
CBK imposed them may also be re-introduced.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the financial sector linked the move to last week's
discussions in Nairobi between visiting U.S. Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin and Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi.
</P>
<P>
A top Interpol official was quoted by the report as saying
that Nairobi with its sophisticated money market provided a
perfect front for money laundering.
</P>
<P>
The "cleaning" of illegal money from activity such as drug and
arms racketeering is usually through investing in legal business,
from which the proceeds are then passed off as untainted.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Hospitals in the India capital
has been paralyzed as over 70,000 health employees began their
indefinite strike Monday morning, demanding more patient care and
washing allowances and time-bound promotions.
</P>
<P>
The health employees in 26 Delhi government-run hospitals and
the all Indian Institute of Medical Science resorted to strike
following the failure of talks between the employees' leaders and
Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare Dalit Ezhilmalai
here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Organizer of the strike, the Joint Action Council, said Monday
that the employees were forced to go on strike because the
government refused to give them any concrete assurance.
</P>
<P>
Ezhilmalai reportedly assured the employees during his talks
with the employees' leaders that their demands, like increase in
patient-care and other allowances, could be met only if they
called off the strike.
</P>
<P>
Appealing to the employees not to joint the strike, the
minister said the Health Ministry had forwarded a proposal on
their demands for approval to the group of ministers set up by
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
But Convener of the Joint Action Council Ram Kishen complained
Sunday the apart from setting up the group of ministers to look
into demands of the health employees, no specific steps had been
taken by the Health Ministry to redress their grievances.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Exploit World Halal Food Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Monday pledged to
work towards becoming an international halal (permitted by Muslim
laws) food hub to capitalize on the 80 billion U.S. dollars halal
food market worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Its Agriculture Minister Sulaiman Daud said Monday his ministry
was discussing with state governments the creation of permanent
food production zones and agro-technology parks for the private
sector to invest in high-tech food production and integrated food
processing projects including that for halal food.
</P>
<P>
Being a reputable Islamic country, Malaysia is already a
selling point especially for its halal food products' entry into
the Muslim world such as the West Asia markets, he told reporters
after opening the two-day National Agri-Food Conference here.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the U.S. alone, the demand for halal food
amounts to 6 billion ringgit (about 1.456 billion U.S. dollars)
annually.
</P>
<P>
Without giving the target date for the establishment of the
hub, he said it depends much on the private sector.
</P>
<P>
He said that the halal food industry and the downstream
agro-based industry as a whole had tremendous potential.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Firms Fear Losses as Power Rationing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan manufacturers and general
consumers have braced for countrywide power rationing which they
say will slow down economic recovery in the east African state.
</P>
<P>
Chris Kirubi, chief of the Kenya Association of Manufacturers,
said the rationing would adversely affect industry.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturers said they lost 20 to 30 percent in revenue
due to the rationing they suffered from last year.
</P>
<P>
"The rationing portends major losses as machines will remain
idle and production will be reduced," Kirubi was quoted by
Monday's East African weekly as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC) announced a
nationwide power rationing schedule Wednesday, set to last until
mid September.
</P>
<P>
The company said the power interruptions had been caused by
the shutdown of the Kipevu and Masinga power stations due to
broken machinery and for the maintenance of one unit each at
Gitaru and Kipevu plants.
</P>
<P>
The power shortage will be felt during the day and evening
peak periods because of a total shortfall of 140 milliwatts (MW)
in the morning and peak periods.
</P>
<P>
A KPLC official said the blackouts, which begin at 8:00 a.m.
and last up to six hours in designated areas will last as long as
it takes the company to repair the machinery.
</P>
<P>
"We rely on the power supplied by the Kenya Power Company and
the rationing plan is based on the current output," said Florence
Obura, communications manager at KPLC.
</P>
<P>
Kenya generates 806 MW of electricity daily, comprising hydro
(584 MW), geothermal (45 MW), and thermal (177 MW).

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Recalling Five More Diplomats From Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korea is recalling five more
diplomats from Russia to reduce its number of intelligence agents
in Russia to the level of Russian agents in South Korea, the
Foreign Ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The withdrawal is in accordance with an agreement between the
intelligence authorities of both countries," said Foreign Ministry
spokesman Lee Ho-jin.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, both countries will limit to two the
number of intelligence officials each country will keep in its
diplomatic missions in the other's territory.
</P>
<P>
Lee hoped that the agreement would resolve a diplomatic row
which began early this month when each country expelled one
diplomat on charges of spying.
</P>
<P>
In negotiations that followed, Russia acknowledged that it has
two intelligence agents at its embassy in Seoul and proposed that
South Korea limit its intelligence officials in Russia to the same
number, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
According the spokesman, among the five South Koreans to be
withdrawn, two agents are in South Korea's embassy in Moscow and
three from its consulate in Vladivostok.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic row began on July 4 when Russia ordered the
expulsion of a South Korean diplomat, Cho Sung-woo, on spy
charges. Four days later, South Korea retaliated by ordering the
expulsion of a Russian diplomat in Seoul, Oleg N. Abramkin.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Diversify Exports to Boost Forex: PM </HEADLINE>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar Take Measures to Cope with Asian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The regional financial crisis,
which swept Southeast Asia, affected Myanmar to certain extent,
prompting a rise in commodity prices and a drop in the exchange
rate of the Myanmar currency Kyat against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar Minister of Finance and Revenue U Khin Maung Thein
admitted at a recent meeting here of senior finance officials of
the nine ASEAN countries that the crisis affected his country
slightly.
</P>
<P>
Although the effect on Myanmar is not seen as serious as those
suffered by some other Southeast Asian countries, which are
directly hit by the crisis, measures have been taken by the
government to prevent it from going worse since the outbreak of
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the financial storm affected Myanmar's
 foreign trade and investment to some extent.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign trade in the 1997-98 fiscal year, which
ended in March, totaled 3.24 billion U.S. dollars, of which
exports amounted to one billion dollars, registering a deficit of
1.24 billion dollars in its balance of trade in the period.
</P>
<P>
Its border trade with neighboring countries such as Bangladesh,
China, India and Thailand was also affected.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the exchange rate fluctuation between the
Myanmar currency Kyat and the U.S. dollar arising from the
regional monetary crisis, the foreign investment climate has also
been dampened in the country, with the increase in foreign
investment in 1997 less than that in 1996 and a fall of one
billion dollars despite reaching a total of 6.6 billion at the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
The crisis is also seen as a factor which hindered Myanmar's
endeavors to achieve the set growth of 6.4 percent in its gross
domestic product in 1997-98, which increased by only 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
In one of the measures that have been taken, Myanmar has called
for boosting production and promoting export, especially the
production of import substitute goods and export items to ensure
hard currency earning.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, priority is being given to the building of mills
and factories which can manufacture the designated goods for
export.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, consumers in the country have also been urged
to use more local-made goods instead of foreign ones in face of
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, like some other member states of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) which are adopting the "sell more,
buy less" formula, also called for importing less and exporting
more, and moving the priority tag from luxury items to more
essential ones.
</P>
<P>
The government also curtailed its imports by limiting import of
some categories of consumer goods in an effort to prevent foreign
exchange reserves from draining.
</P>
<P>
To preserve its dwindling foreign exchange reserves, which
stood at 272.7 million U.S. dollars at the end of September 1997,
Myanmar had begun controlling foreign exchange payments in August
the same year, limiting the payments for imports, foreign
remittances and overseas loans to 50,000 dollars per month.
</P>
<P>
Although the country insisted on continuous implementation of
some major projects in its efforts to bring about infrastructural
development when the effect is slight, care is being taken in the
supervision of monetary affairs to avoid mistakes amid the crisis
by not giving priority to those to-be-implemented housing or
construction projects which are not directly related to the
productive sector.
</P>
<P>
In early January, an official seminar on analysis and
assessment of the economic situation in Myanmar was convened to
study the effect on the country of the regional financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
At the time when the region is experiencing the currency
turbulence, Myanmar joined in signing a memorandum of
understanding on multilateral cooperation with other member states
in the ASEAN financial sector at a special meeting of the
grouping's finance ministers held in Kuala Lumpur last December.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar Finance and Revenue Minister reaffirmed that his
country is ready to participate in resolving the regional
financial crisis in cooperation with other ASEAN member states.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Muslims Live Longer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Muslims in northwest China's
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Regions enjoy comparatively long lives
because of their diet, prayers, health habits, and genetic
factors, according to researchers who studied the people of
Ningxia's Yongning County, where there are many centenarians.
</P>
<P>
The Regional Bureau of Health says that Ningxia had 22
centenarians out of 1.78 million Muslim people, while the Chinese
capital, Beijing, had 56 centenarians out of some 11 million
people in 1990.
</P>
<P>
China has some 8,000 centenaries on record, out of more than
1.2 billion people, most of them living in remote mountainous
parts of northwestern, southern, and southwestern China.
</P>
<P>
The Muslims of Yongning County usually eat mutton or beef once
a week, along with rice, pancakes, fresh vegetables, green tea,
Chinese wolfberry, red jujubes, raisins, and rock candy on a daily
basis.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the tea can help kidney function, removing
excess food in the stomach, and prolonging life.
</P>
<P>
Like other male Muslims elsewhere, 91-year-old Na Shengcai, a
farmer in Najiahu Village, Yongning County, goes to the mosque
five times a day to pray.
</P>
<P>
He has been getting up at about 4 o'clock in the morning and
walking to the mosque for the past 50 years. Before going to the
mosque, he takes a shower or washes his hands and face, and says
that the prayers are just like callisthenics and are a kind of
exercise.
</P>
<P>
After morning prayers, he does some farm work on 0.1 hectare of
leased land and says that going to field each day enables him to
breathe fresh air and helps his physique.
</P>
<P>
Na Hongjun, the head of the village, says that his village has
6 people above the age of 100. The eldest is 108 and the youngest,
104. Of 4,000 villagers, more than 400 are above the age of 70.
</P>
<P>
Na Shengcai's wife is 87 years old and the extended family has
five generations.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Health also says that the average life expectancy
of Muslims here has risen from 35 in 1949 to 69.5.

<HEADLINE> China Trying To Increase Building Materials Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- China plans to stop the decline in
building materials exports that resulted from the financial crisis
in Southeast Asia by concentrating on ceramics and plate glass.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior State Administration of Building
Materials official, building materials exports, mainly cement, to
Southeast Asian countries have fallen sharply this year and he has
called on departments and enterprises to look to international
markets and to pay closer attention to quality control.
</P>
<P>
He says that building materials companies need to make a
greater effort to protect their Southeast Asian market share,
while expanding their presence in the Middle East and Africa.
</P>
<P>
Chinese ceramics have an 8,000-year history and the industry
has been enjoying fast growth, producing nearly 10 billion pieces
of ceramics annually, or about 60 percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
China has a market for its ceramics products in 150 countries
and regions and annual exports worth 1.9 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
To tap the export potential of ceramics, the official says,
China's main ceramics producers should increase technological
renovation that reduces pollution, cuts energy consumption, and
improves process and quality.

<HEADLINE> Number of Sri Lankan Expatriate Workers on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The number of Sri Lanka's new
expatriate workers in the first four months of this year was about
47,100, an increase of 11 percent over the corresponding period
last year.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan expatriate workers remitted 1.08 billion U.S.
dollars in 1997 compared to 770 million dollars in 1996, Foreign
Employment Bureau (FEB) sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The FEB is set to provide employment for 200,000 persons this
year and has already found markets in several Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey of the FEB revealed that during the last one
and a half years, 150,000 Sri Lankans obtained new employment
abroad with 86 percent of them being employed as housemaids.
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of the housemaids are employed in Middle East
countries such as Saudi Arabia, Syria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon,
Oman and UAE while others are employed in countries and regions
like Singapore, Hong Kong, Cyprus, Greece and the Maldives.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are about one million Sri Lankans working
overseas, of whom 70 percent are females.
</P>
<P>
The FEB wants to provide employment opportunities for 1.2
million Sri Lankan people by the year 2000.

</P>
<P>
Zhuhai became the first area in China to initiate a reward

</P>
<P>
This has paid off handsomely in the city's high-tech output
value of 12 billion yuan in 1997, compared with less than 1
billion yuan in 1991, according to Liang Guangda, secretary of the

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Palace Museum Reaches Agreement With Intel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing-based Palace Museum
has reached an agreement with the U.S.'s Intel to solve a dispute
over a Web site on the Internet, it was reported today.
</P>
<P>
Intel created the site earlier this year to provide information
about the museum in the Forbidden City, without Chinese
authorization.
</P>
<P>
Museum officials expressed their displeasure with the move,
saying that it contained some mistakes and that photos and
articles were being used without copyright.
</P>
<P>
The dispute was solved recently, however, according to a museum
spokesman, who says that the Chinese will go along with the site
and provide copyrights for the Americans and see to the
correctness of the contents.
</P>
<P>
Intel says that it will place a notice on the main page, saying
that the Palace Museum supports the site and will provide the
museum with some advanced computer equipment for "further
promoting Chinese culture".
</P>
<P>
The cooperation will mean that previous mistakes are corrected
and that some low-quality pictures are replaced with new ones
provided by the museum, the spokesman says.
</P>
<P>
Some people explain that the dispute was the result of a lack
of legal protection for copyrights in the information era and
Chinese scholars' insufficient understanding of computer
technology development.
</P>
<P>
China has more than one million Internet users who spend most
of their time looking at information from the West.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Guard Eddie Casiano paced the
Puerto Rico cagers for a powerful storm to win over the United
States in the first-day preliminaries at the fourth Goodwill Games
here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Casiano contributed 31 points to his team's victory over the

which I hadn't been doing," said Casiano after the match.

advantage at half break before their experienced opponents rallied
back to overtake the lead in the second half.

<P>
With organized offensives, the Puerto Rico players overpassed
their American rivals who once led 20 points in the second half to
secure a significant victory.

of the second half, our defense started taking over for us," said
Carlos Morales, Puerto Rico coach, in a post-match press briefing.
</P>
<P>
However, his U.S. counterpart Clem Haskins attributed his
team's defeat to the young ages and inexperience and the credit to
the Puerto Rico team.
</P>
<P>
All eight men's basketball teams competed on Sunday in the
rounds with Lithuania defeating Russia 79-72.
</P>
<P>
The Russians also played an uphand first half for a 38-35

<HEADLINE> 1,000-year-old Cliff Burial Site In Southwestern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The site of a cliff burial dating
back some 1,000 years has been found in a suburb of this capital
of China's Sichuan province.
</P>
<P>
Local archaeologists excavated 2 of the 28 burial rooms and
unearthed more than 500 relics, including a great number of coins,
pieces of porcelain, pottery, and iron weapons.
</P>
<P>
One of the burial rooms is 20 m long and has 4 side chambers
decorated with colorful designs. Ten pottery coffins were found
inside.
</P>
<P>
The other, to the scholars' surprise, contained pottery coffins
from the Five Dynasties (907-979) as well as pottery jars with
ashes dating to later dynasties.
</P>
<P>
This suggests that the burial room was entered by people later
on, the scholars say, and point out that that was quite unusual in
Chinese history.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Chickens Output to Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will produce around 14.5
million chickens a week during the second half of this year, a 6.5
percent decline from an earlier forecast of 15.5 million,
according to a poultry industry source.
</P>
<P>
The adjustment reflects the economic slowdown, which reduced
chicken meat consumption by about 30 percent during the first half
of the year, the source was quoted Monday by the Bangkok Post as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Of the total production, five million chickens will be for the
domestic market and the remaining will feed export markets.
</P>
<P>
The industry has been adjusting its strategies by increasing
exports in order to earn more foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
Exports of chickens in the first five months of the year
totaled 102,000 tons, an increase of 44.2 percent over the same
period last year. The value of exports rose by 105 percent to 10.8
billion baht (270 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Over 6 Million Affected by Flood in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The current flood has hit 27 of
Bangladesh's 64 districts, affecting over six million people, and
the death toll has risen to over 60, official sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, the unofficial number of flood-affected people and
death toll might be more than double the official one, according
to press reports.
</P>
<P>
The flood-affected people are suffering a lot, taking shelter
on flood protection embankments, in educational institutions and
in relief camps, and there are not enough food, drinking water,
fuel and medicine available though the government departments
concerned have made great efforts in this regard, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, an outbreak of diarrheal diseases has been reported
from all over the flood-hit districts.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief has already
granted about two million taka (about 42,000 U.S. dollars) and
nearly 2,000 tons of rice and other materials as relief for the
affected people.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has also instructed all the local district
governments to make coordinated efforts to ensure supply of pure
drinking water and preventive medicine and protection of
embankments in the affected areas.
</P>
<P>
The flood situation in the central part of the country may
worsen further in a few days to come while that in the northern
part may continue to improve, the Flood Forecasting and Warning
Center predicted.

<HEADLINE> Qian: China Wants Closer Ties With Caribbean Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRIDGETOWN, Barbados, July 20 (Xinhua) -- China is willing to
establish a long-term, stable and enduring friendly relationship
with the Caribbean nations, Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen said
here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation
(CBC), Qian said better China-Caribbean ties, like those between
China and Barbados, are mutually beneficial.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that Barbados has always adhered to the one-China
policy and does not endorse any pro-independence activities by
Taiwan, which is a province of China.
</P>
<P>
On its part, China recently helped Barbados build an up-to-date
gymnasium, and trained 16 scholars in weather forecast,
traditional Chinese medicine, veterinary medicine and solar energy.
</P>
<P>
Since China and Barbados established diplomatic relations more
than 20 years ago, their bilateral relations have been developing
smoothly, said Qian.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that China has diplomatic relations with 162
countries and only a small number of countries maintain so-called
"diplomatic relations" with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Among the 16 Caribbean countries, nine have diplomatic ties
with China. In Asia no country recognizes Taiwan; and in Europe,
no country except the Vatican City State recognizes Taiwan, said
Qian.
</P>
<P>
"But regretfully, this is not the case in the Caribbean
region. I'm confident that this situation will change," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Historically speaking, the Chinese people are not unfamiliar
with this region," said Qian. "Our relations with this region are
growing, and are becoming better and better."
</P>
<P>
He noted that China became a full member of the Caribbean
Development Bank (CDB) last January and pledged to contribute 5
percent of the bank's capital resources.
</P>
<P>
"As a full member of the CDB, China will have more exchanges
and close links in economy with the Caribbean nations through the
CDB," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Predicting that China's economy will continue to grow in the
next five years, Qian said cooperation and exchanges between China
and the Caribbean nations will increase.

<HEADLINE> Thai Ministry Expects 270,000 Workers to Be Sacked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Labor Ministry expects
another 270,000 workers to be laid off nationwide as more
companies will be closed down due to liquidity crunch.
</P>
<P>
Labor Minister Trairong Suwankhiri said on Sunday that
liquidity crunch will force a total of 790 companies to shut down.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's research has found that the companies would need
35.6 billion baht (890 million U.S. dollars) to survive, according
to Monday's Bangkok Post.
</P>
<P>
Trairong said the government would try to negotiate the
companies' debt restructuring and find more credit for them.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said the result would depend on the
negotiations between the companies and banks.
</P>
<P>
He said if the companies eventually had to shut down, the
ministry would try to find new jobs for laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the ministry contributed to attempts to solve the
liquidity problems by having the Social Security Fund lend 4.7
billion baht (117 million dollars) to businesses through
commercial banks and Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is being plagued by a growing number of unemployed
workers estimated at 2.7 million at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Ong-art Klampaiboon, Democrat MP and
secretary of the foreign minister, warned that Thai workers
seeking jobs in foreign countries might be cheated and end up
stranded overseas.
</P>
<P>
He said the Foreign Ministry had last year helped some 4,000
Thais overseas, mainly mistreated workers and students who faced
financial problems.
</P>
<P>
Ong-art added that the ministry had this year rescued some
2,100 Thai expatriates. He suggested that workers wishing to work
overseas should consult Labor Ministry offices nationwide so as to
avoid being cheated.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Protests Armed Albanians' Entry into Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry
lodged a strong protest with Albania Sunday over the illegal
entrance by hundreds of armed Albanians into the Serbian province
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry said in a note to the Albanian embassy in
Belgrade that despite repeated warnings and protests, armed
Albanians had not ceased their forced entrance into the troubled
Serbian province, where ethnic Albanians are fighting for
independence.
</P>
<P>
The note complained that the Albanian government had done
nothing to stop the blatant breaches of the border, but connived
at them.
</P>
<P>
The note said the Albanian government should bear all
consequences resulting from these grave incidents.
</P>
<P>
However, Albanian Deputy Defense Minister Ilir Bocka
immediately denied reports of such intrusions, saying that armed
Albanian personnel are not involved in any actions taking place
outside Albania's borders.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the armed Albanians just wanted to defend the
border and territory from Serbs' attacks and threats.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Exports to ASEAN Countries Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's exports to other members
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) recorded a
31 percent drop in the first six months compared with the same
period last year, a Trade Ministry report said.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam, which gained 1.05 billion U.S. dollars from shipments
to other ASEAN countries in the first six months of last year, has
met with difficulties in boosting exports since last July when a
financial crisis broke out in some Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
As some currencies in the region have been depreciated,
Vietnamese commodities are less competitive in terms of price in
the ASEAN market, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Vietnam also encountered problems with getting paid
for its rice exports to some countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam, which imported from ASEAN countries 1.75 billion
dollars of goods in the past six months, will boost barter trade
so as to strengthen its commercial cooperation with ASEAN
countries and to ease the adverse effects of the depreciation of
the currencies in the region, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Exports to ASEAN countries used to make up 30 percent of the
country's total export turnover, the report added.

<HEADLINE> 8 Irrigation Facilities Built in Myanmar in 1997-98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A total of eight irrigation
facilities were built in 1997-98 fiscal year which ended in March,
irrigating 184,072 hectares of farmland, according to a latest
report on Myanmar's financial, economic and social conditions.
</P>
<P>
Of the 18 million hectares of cultivated land in the country,
12 million hectares were planted with crops in the 1997-98, it
said.
</P>
<P>
To boost the country's agriculture, Myanmar has built a total
of 90 dams and reservoirs since late 1988, of which 22 are in
central Mandalay division where arid zones lie.
</P>
<P>
Greening projects are also being implemented in 13 arid zones
in the division where water is scarce even for domestic
consumption.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar registered a growth of 4.6 percent of its gross
domestic product (GDP) in the 1997-98, in which agriculture, the
mainstay of the country's economy, grew by 2.9 percent in its
output value, accounting for 35.6 percent of the total GDP and
about 35 percent of the export.

BUCHAREST, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The police in east Romania have
discovered a human organ-smuggling ring, the Mediafax news agency
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A warrant has been issued to arrest Gheorghe Vaduva, the major
suspect, who is at large.
</P>
<P>
According to information from the Constanta County Police

least 20 Romanians aged between 21-47 sell one of their kidneys at
a price of 4,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Vaduva could earn 1,000 dollars from each of them, and all the
kidneys would be sold to western countries at a price of several
hundred thousand or more than one million dollars, said Dan
Salomia, a police officer.
</P>
<P>
Under Romanian law, it is illegal to trade human organs in this
way.

<HEADLINE> 48,000 Thai Graduates to Face joblessness Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Up to 48,000 new university
graduates will join the ranks of the unemployed in Thailand at the
end of next year, according to a senior official at the Thai
University Affairs Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment among new university graduates is found in every
field, even in popular fields like engineering and architecture.
Businesses are in very bad shape, Pramote Chotimongkol, deputy
permanent secretary of the ministry, was quoted Monday by the
Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, unemployment was low among law graduates.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has seen a continual rise in unemployment since 1994.
In 1995, there were 13,400 jobless graduates and the following
year the figure jumped to 18,000.
</P>
<P>
It has also been estimated that between 1996 and 1999 there
will be 40,000-48,000 new university graduates coming onto the
market each year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry, together with the Labor Ministry, is asking for
one billion baht (25 million U.S. dollars) in loans from the World
Bank to create jobs for new graduates, Pramote said.

SOFIA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Hristo Bonev is to stay on as coach
of the Bulgarian national team in spite of its poor performances
at the World Cup finals in France.

Bonev was unanimously agreed for another four-year tenure by
the Executive Committee of Bulgarian Football Association on

</P>
<P>
Association president Ivan Slavkov extended his thanks for
Bonev's effort on behalf of the association and the fans despite
the sad fact that Bulgaria, semifinalists in the 1994 World Cup,
failed to make the last 16 and was even beaten 1-6 by Spain in the
last group match in France.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Deadly Heat Wave Lingers in Southern U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Heat continued to plague the
U.S. southern Great Plains on Sunday and has already caused 110
deaths.
</P>
<P>
Dallas in Texas reached 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees
celsius) by early afternoon, the city's 14th straight day of
triple-digit temperatures, and highs were forecast to hit 100 or
more at least through Wednesday across much of the southern
Plains, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
It is the worst summer heat wave for Texas since 1980, when the
state had 42 consecutive days of 100-degree temperatures.
</P>
<P>
Readings also hit 100 by midday at Altus, Oklahoma;
Jacksonville in Arkansas; and Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma State officials estimated that the heat and drought
has cost the state's farmers and ranchers at least two billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Six of the heat-related deaths have been reported in Oklahoma,
and state health commissioner Dr. Jerry Nida said the state
Department of Health is monitoring nursing homes and trying to
develop a network to protect the elderly who live elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Texas had 79 deaths blamed on the heat, and California, Arizona
and Missouri had one each.
</P>
<P>
Louisiana reported 22 deaths, more than in 1996 and 1997
combined. Dr. Louise McFarland, the state epidemiologist, said,
"There are probably many more out there that we haven't heard of
yet."
</P>
<P>
In Dallas, Zachary Thompson, deputy director of county Health
and Human Services, spent most of his Sunday unloading box fans
and window units that were donated to the agency for people
without air conditioners to fight the heat.
</P>
<P>
For people who have air conditioners but do not use them for
fear of high electric bills, Thompson said the county had
established a program for people to make donations to help people
with their bills.
</P>
<P>
Increased water use because of the heat has put a strain on the
water systems of several communities around Texas, causing a
handful of water main breaks every day. Dallas had 67 ruptured
mains in two days last week and Dallas Water Utilities has put its
repair crews on 12-hour shifts.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Winner of 21 Grand Slam singles
titles, Steffi Graf captured her sixth A&AMP;P Tennis Classic
championship in Mahwah, New Jersey on Sunday by defeating Amanda
Coetzer 6-3, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Graf has won the annual exhibition tournament six of the seven
times she's participated, losing only to Kathy Rinaldi in the 1985
final. In the 21-year history of the event, no other player has
won it more than twice.
</P>
<P>
Winning the the A-and-P Classic, though it is only an
exhibition event, was a significant step in Graf's comeback from
surgery on her right knee in June of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Although Coetzer is only 4-10 lifetime against Graf on the WTA
Tour, three of those four wins came in 1997, including a victory
at the Australian Open when Graf was still ranked No. 1 and
another at the French Open.
</P>
<P>
Graf is currently ranked 57th in the world while Coetzer is
ranked eighth.
</P>
<P>
Neither player was at their best in Sunday's error-filled
final. Still, Graf continued to show signs of improvement.
</P>
<P>
Her backhand slice was her most effective weapon. She used it
repeatedly to work Coetzer's backhand, causing her to commit
several unforced errors.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Public Sector Deficit Seen to Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' consolidated
public sector deficit is estimated to reach 50 billion pesos this
year, substantially higher than the projected 26.5 billion pesos
under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program, a newspaper
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Star reported that Finance Secretary Edgardo
Espiritu made the assessment Sunday taking into account the
government's expected 20 billion peso (500 million U.S. dollar) to
30 billion peso (750 million dollar) budget deficit for the whole
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to Espiritu, government economic managers believe
that the projected budget gap is manageable.
</P>
<P>
Based on the simulations conducted by the Department of
Finance, the public sector deficit may hit 82.4 billion pesos (2.1
billion dollars), about three percent of gross domestic product if
the government's budget gap deteriorates to 59.4 billion pesos
(1.5 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Public sector deficit refers to the aggregate financial
positions of the national government, government-owned and
-controlled companies, and local government units.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Jobless Man Arrested for Trafficking Ecstasy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- An Indonesian unemployed man was
arrested for alleged possession and trafficking in Ecstasy and the
amphetamine-derivative shabu-shabu, the Jakarta Post Monday quoted
an official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The man was arrested by Jakarta Police Narcotics Unit officers
at his boarding house on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The tips on his activities were from nearby residents. He was
under our surveillance for quite a long time," deputy chief of the
city police detective unit Lt. Col. Bakat Purwanto said.
</P>
<P>
Police seized 1,049 Ecstasy pills and 60 grams of shabu-shabu
hidden in a drawer in his bedroom.
</P>
<P>
The man is believed to have been part of a drug-trafficking
network operating on college campuses and in discotheques, Bakat
said.
</P>
<P>
He said illegal drug transactions seemed to be growing despite
the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
During the first six months of this year alone, the Jakarta
Police Narcotics Unit has reportedly arrested at least 65
suspected drug users, traffickers and suppliers. Five of the
suspects have been shot to death during raids.
</P>
<P>
Forty-five kilograms of marijuana, four cannabis samplings, 150
grams of putauw (low-grade heroin), 7.5 kilograms of shabu-shabu,
780 grams of cocaine and about 1,800 Ecstasy pills have reportedly
been confiscated during the period.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Gov't Plans to Impose Export Quota on Logs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government plans to
impose a quota on exports of logs to guarantee a sufficient supply
for domestic demand, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
The export quota would not contravene the government's reform
program agreed to with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
because it did not constitute a ban on export of the commodity,
the Jakarta Post Monday quoted Forest Minister Muslimin Nasution
as saying at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
"Timber companies will be allowed to export after the supply of
logs can meet domestic demand for a minimum three months," he
said.
</P>
<P>
But he said the export quota system was still needed to
anticipate growing demand from overseas.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with economic reform programs signed on January
15 with the IMF, the government agreed to reduce export taxes on
logs saw timber and rattan to 30 percent by the end of June, 20
percent by the end of December this year, 15 percent by the end of
December 1999 and 10 percent by December 2000.
</P>
<P>
It also stipulated the government would eliminate all other
types of export restrictions, such as quotas, in three years.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 20 (Xinhua)-- Banks in the east China
municipality of Shanghai, the nation's leading economic center,
continued to support urban infrastructure projects by
extending more loans during the first half of 1998, according to
the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China (PBOC).
</P>
<P>
A number of key projects in the city, one of China's largest
metropolitan centers, have received substantial funding from major
banks, according to a PBOC official.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of China has provided more than 300 million US dollars
for the Shanghai Urban infrastructure Investment and Development
Corp, as well as 550 million yuan for the No.2 Metro Project, and
separate loans of 59 million US dollars and 20 million franc for a
passenger tunnel project beneath the Huangpu River.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years alone, the Shanghai Branch of the
Bank of Communications has extended loans totaling 900 million yuan
for viaduct project and the No.2 Metro Project. The bank pledged
to provide loans of over one billion yuan to the viaduct project
during 1998.

sectors, according to economists.

<HEADLINE> NZ Government Urged To Address Decline of Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government is
urged to address the country's "inability to recruit and retain
scientists."
</P>
<P>
In its latest estimates report, the Education and Science
Committee of the New Zealand Parliament says that the Ministry of
Research, Science and Technology needs to work with the Ministry
of Education to more effectively promote careers in science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
The committee says that science remains an unattractive career
option in New Zealand because it is so poorly paid relative to
other professions. This and lower-than-expected research funding
increases in this year's budget appear to be the "leading cause of
disillusionment" among scientists.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Minister of Research, Science and Technology
Maurice Williamson warned that the low numbers of New Zealanders
in science and technology-based careers will soon result in a
"massive shortage of human capital" in the country's science and
technology sector.

JAKARTA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Marauding herds of hungry
elephants went on the rampage in Indonesia's Sumatra Island,
destroying houses and crops, the Indonesian Observer reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the remote province of Aceh in north Sumatra, the wild
elephants attacked a village and plantation estate, damaging
several hectares of rubber trees and crops at Calang subdistrict.
</P>
<P>
The elephants stayed at the rubber plantation and nearby farms
for 15 days, before wildlife officials were able to chase them
back into the jungle, the report quoted head of the local Natural
Resources Conservation Agency Bambang Suprayogi as saying.
</P>
<P>
In Lampung province in South Sumatra, about 20 angry elephants
stormed into several villages late last week. Terrified residents
fled their houses to escape from the vicious beasts.

<HEADLINE> Briton, Canadian Win at HK Kai Tak Int'l Duathlon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 19 (Xinhua) -- James Endicott from Britain and
Laura Walsh from Canada won the men's and women's open categories
at the 1998 Hong Kong Kai Tak International Airport Duathlon race
here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kai Tak is the site of the former Hong Kong International
Airport. The airport has been relocated to Chek Lap Kok. The old
airport site, closed since July 6 this year, is to be transformed
into commercial use, according to a plan of the Special
Administrative Region government.
</P>
<P>
Endiccot, 19, finished the five-km run, the 30 km bicycle race
and another five km run in a time of one hour 30 minutes 48
seconds, followed by Andrew Patrick and Daniel Brown, both of Hong
Kong, in 1:30:58 and in 1:31:33.
</P>
<P>
"It's a chance of a lifetime," said Endicott, who came here not
long ago and is going back to Britain for university studies in
September.
</P>
<P>
"It's just wonderful as it was the first time for me to run and
bike on a completely flat course. It's really unusual," he said.
</P>
<P>
Walsh, 32, a professional triathlete for four years, covered
the same distance in 1:37:29. Local racers Kim Isherwood and Ania
Sroka finished second and third in 1:39:25 and 1:43:25
respectively.
</P>
<P>
"It was my first race in four years. The course is very good
and I'm happy with my time today," she said after the awarding
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Walsh, who fell ill seriously two years ago, said she'd planned
to compete in an international outdoor adventure race named Eco
Challenge, this September in Morocco.
</P>
<P>
Also held on Sunday were races Veteran, Relay, Junior, Novice
and Youth categories.
</P>
<P>
Manda Tam, Senior Sports Executive of the Hong Kong Triathlon
Association, said the turnout of more than 400 on Sunday's race
was a record for any such race in Hong Kong. The association is
considering hosting an Asian Duathlon championships at Kai Tak if
the reformation project for the site is not to kick off soon, she
said.

<HEADLINE> NZ's Telecommunication Companies in Heated Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Price war, which is being waged
 between New Zealand's telecommunication companies, has brought
cheaper calls for their customers.
</P>
<P>
Lower phone bills are becoming a reality, with Telecom, New
Zealand's largest listed company, cutting toll call charges to
hang on to customers being wooed away by cut-rate competitors.
</P>
<P>
From Monday some of Telecom's international toll charges will
fall by more than 50 per cent and a flat-rate deal for national
toll calls is being introduced to rival competing offers.
</P>
<P>
Telecom customers will pay a peak rate of 62 cents a minute for
calls to Britain and the United States, down from 1.38 NZ dollars.
Peak time calls to Australia now cost 55 cents a minute compared
with 83 cents previously. Some off-peak rates have also been
trimmed.
</P>
<P>
Telecom takes cut-rate measures because of the fact that its
share in the international toll market has fallen from 74 percent
late last year to 64 percent today. Niche toll service providers
such as Worldxchange and others have been undercutting Telecom on
international toll pricing and drawing customers away.
</P>
<P>
Worldxchange, which went into partnership with retailer Deka
last month, is still undercutting Telecom's new rates. It is
charging 57 cents a minute for peak calls to Britain, 51 cents a
minute to the United States, and 45 cents a minute to Australia.
</P>
<P>
The fierce competition is likely to continue to push toll call
prices lower.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Telecom Chief Executive Roderick Deane said
that cutting prices in the "intensely competitive" environment was
a "way of life now".

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Sees Steady Foreign Capital Inflow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 19 (Xinhua) -- An average of 6 billion
U.S. dollars of foreign capital and individual remittance flowed
into Lebanon annually for the past years, a senior central bank
official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Nasser Saidi, the first vice governor of Bank of Lebanon
attributed the steady inflow of foreign capital to a stable
Lebanese currency.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Orient radio, Saidi said a stable
currency in Lebanon increased the assets of the country's banks,
which rose to 2.3 billion dollars in March from 140 million
dollars in 1992.
</P>
<P>
To maintain a stable currency tops Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri's ambitious reconstruction agenda adopted after the
devastating 1975-90 civil war.
</P>
<P>
Saidi said he was confident about Lebanon's economy in view of
the good reputation Lebanon enjoyed in the international financial
market and an ability of issuing long-term bonds with low interest
rates thanks to its stable currency.
</P>
<P>
In April, the Lebanese government successfully issued 1 billion
dollars' worth of European bonds in the international market to
help pay off huge domestic debts and interests.
</P>
<P>
The government is considering to issue another 1 billion
dollars of bonds at the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Russia Urge Determination on Caspian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Russia called here Sunday
for a speedy determination of the Caspian Sea legal regime by the
five littoral states to secure fair distribution of the resources.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi and visiting Russian
Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov made the call in a meeting
Sunday, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Pastukhov urged that the legal regime be compiled unanimously
by the five littoral states as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that the speedy formulation of the legal regime
would avail the littoral states with the chance to have a fair
share of the sea's reserves free from other countries'
intervention.
</P>
<P>
Pastukhov arrived here Friday to explain the signing of an
agreement between Russia and Kazakhstan on July 6 to divide the
northern part of the Caspian Sea into separate Russian and Kazak
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Pastukhov assured Kharrazi of Russia's compliance with the 1921
and 1940 accords signed between the former Soviet Union and Iran,
the two Caspian littoral states before the collapse of the former
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The two documents determined a common ownership by Iran and the
former Soviet Union over the Caspian Sea, which is believed to
have a reserve of 16 billion barrels of crude oil and 8.3 trillion
cubic meters of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
After the Soviet collapse, the three newly independent littoral
states -- Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan -- with oil near
their coastlines, want the water to be divided into national
sectors so they can claim the oil for themselves.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran and Russia, two nations with little oil reserves
near their coastlines, demanded equal exploitation of the sea's
resources.
</P>
<P>
Iran, insisting on equal access to Caspian riches, lashed out
at the Russian-Kazakhstan agreement, saying that it did not
recognize any bilateral agreement and that the legal regime of
world's largest inland water should be determined by all the five
littoral states.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Pastukhov dismissed the allegations that
Russia, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan have got united against
Islamism, but said that Russia is against any extremist thoughts,
especially those prevalent in Afghanistan.
