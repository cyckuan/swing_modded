<HEADLINE> Russian Inflation Jumps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian consumer prices jumped 2.8 percent in  
June, up from a 1.9 percent rise the month before, the Russian 
Statistics Agency said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Inflation remains relatively high, but the government has been  
able to bring it down somewhat following a surge in prices that 
accompanied last year's financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	During the first seven months of 1998, Russian inflation was 4  
percent. But prices shot up after the government devalued the ruble 
and defaulted on debts that August, and inflation for all of 1998 
ended up being 84 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Inflation was 28 percent for the first seven months of this  
year, the government statistics agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other economic news, the Russian government benefited from  
better-than-expected tax and customs collection in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tax Ministry collected $1.2 billion in July, 31 percent  
higher than targeted. Customs officials collected $829 million in 
July, just above predictions. No reasons were given for the 
better-than-expected revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Russia's draft federal budget for 2000 will be ready  
for review Aug. 12, Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Khristenko told 
the Interfax news agency. The draft calls for a budget surplus and 
tax revenues of $27 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft budget foresees an average exchange rate of 32 rubles  
to the U.S. dollar in 2000. The ruble is currently trading at about 
24 to the dollar.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Swimming Team in Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Maybe the United States swimming squad  
at the Pan American Games should be labeled a ``B'' team, after 
all. 
</P>
<P>
	While the athletes and coaches disdained that tag prior to the  
competition, the confused Americans are losing at an alarming rate. 
</P>
<P>
	With 10 events completed, they have only two gold medals, both  
by men. The women are winless in five events, all won by Canadians. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-two events remain, putting the Americans in danger of  
making their worst showing ever. That was four years ago at Mar del 
Plata, Argentina, where they lost 10 of 32 races, four by the women 
and a record six by the men. The most women's losses ever was six 
in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	Never have the rest of the countries combined to beat the  
Americans in total golds, men or women. The closest call for the 
women came in 1955, when they won four golds and the other 
countries also combined for four. The tightest battle for the men 
was in 1951, when they edged the opposition 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, the Americans have dominated in the pool. In 1959 and  
1963, the men and women were 8-0 each in golds, The men also went 
undefeated in 1979, winning all 15 golds, were 15-1 in 1987 and 
14-1 in both 1971 and 1975. The women went 13-1 in both 1975 and 
1979 and 13-2 in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	Typifying this year's woes was Tuesday's performances by Jarod  
Schroeder and Sabir Muhammad in the men's 100-meter butterfly. 
Neither made the final, meaning the U.S. team would not win a medal 
in an individual event for the first time since 1955 and only the 
second time ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was shocked,'' Muhammad, the American record-holder for 50  
and 100 meters in short-course competition, said. 
</P>
<P>
	He blamed his unexpected failure on a horrible dive.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was the worst dive I've ever had in a swim race,'' Muhammad  
said. ``I went four meters, straight down. My usual dive is a lot 
shallower than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The disappointed Schroeder's problem also was his start.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was slow out of the blocks,'' he said. ``I think I was the  
last into the water. 
</P>
<P>
	``I then tried to force the issue, but I wasn't very efficient  
on my stroke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The poor showings surprised the team.  
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't expecting that,'' Eric Donnelly, the silver  
medalist in Tuesday night's 400 individual medley, said. ``Everyone 
was expecting them to be in the top eight and in the medals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a shock. But I don't think anyone let it get to them.''  
</P>
<P>
	Donnelly, for one, didn't let it affect his performance. He  
lowered his career-best by two seconds in winning his preliminary 
heat, then chopped another two seconds off his time in the final, 
finishing in 4 minutes 17.86 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Donnelly was beaten by Canada's Curtis Myden, who was timed in a  
1999 world-leading and Pan Ams record 4:15.52. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think the race would go that fast,'' Donnelly said  
after competing in his first international race. ``I thought just 
under 4:19 would win. After this morning, I wanted to get the 
record, but he beat me to it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not too disappointed.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Americans' only gold Tuesday night came in the final event,  
the men's 800 freestyle relay. Adam Messner, Dan Phillips, Devin 
Howard and Scott Tucker combined to swim 7:22.29. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other finals, Canada's Jessica Deglau won the women's 200  
freestyle at 2:00.65, only .04 seconds off the Canadian record; her 
teammate, Lauren Van Oosten, took the women's 200 breaststroke at 
2:30.36; and Venezuela's Francisco Sanchez won the men's 100 
butterfly in a Games record 53.33. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadians now have six swimming golds, as many as they  
accumulated at the 1995 games, and a total of 11 medals. The U.S. 
also has 11 medals, but only two golds. 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight's finals are the women's 400 freestyle, 100 backstroke  
and 400 freestyle relay, and the men's 100 freestyle and 200 
backstroke. 
</P>
<P>
	In today's prelims, all the Americans advanced, with Aaron  
Peirsol of Irvine, Calif., and Dan Shevcik of Wilton, Conn., 
posting the two-fastest times in the men's 200 backstroke, and 
Denali Knapp of Davis, Calif., registering the quickest time in the 
women's 100 backstroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Peirsol won his heat at 2:00.39 and Shevcik was second at  
2:01.58. Knapp was timed at 1:02.78 in winning her heat.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Lifts Boy Scout Ban on Gays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- For the first time, a state's highest court  
has ruled that the Boy Scouts of America's ban on homosexuals is 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey's Supreme Court said Wednesday that because the Boy  
Scouts are a ``place of public accommodation,'' they fall under the 
state's anti-discrimination law even though it is a private 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling could force the issue into the U.S. Supreme Court,  
which in a past decision refused to review another state's ruling 
that upheld the Boy Scout ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the decision was a victory for James Dale, an assistant  
scoutmaster who was kicked out of the Boy Scouts nine years ago 
when leaders found out he is gay. He sued seeking reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Supreme Court of New Jersey is wonderful,'' Dale said.  
``This is exactly what scouting has taught me: to believe in the 
system and that goodness will prevail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dale, who turned 29 on Monday, called the unanimous decision  
``the best birthday present I could have asked for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the national group vowed to appeal to the United  
States Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	George Davidson, an attorney for the Boy Scouts, had argued the  
group has a right to pick its own leaders without interference from 
``an all-powerful state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sad day when the state dictates to parents what role  
models they must provide for their children,'' Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling contrasted with a March 1998 decision by the  
California Supreme Court in the Boy Scouts' favor. That ruling, 
also unanimous, said the organization was not a business and was 
therefore free to exclude gays, as well as atheists and agnostics. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of that  
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Jersey court said the Boy Scouts organization  
constitutes a ``place of public accommodation'' because it has a 
broad-based membership and forms partnerships with public entities 
like police and fire departments. 
</P>
<P>
	Written by Chief Justice Deborah Poritz, the ruling dismissed  
assertions by the Boy Scouts that the words ``morally straight'' 
and ``clean'' in the Boy Scout Oath constitute a statement against 
homosexuality and allow it to keep gays out. 
</P>
<P>
	The court doubted young boys ``ascribe any meaning to these  
terms other than a commitment to be good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing before us ... suggests that one of Boy Scouts'  
purposes is to promote the view that homosexuality is immoral,'' 
the decision reads. 
</P>
<P>
	The court also said Dale's presence in the group would not  
symbolize an endorsement of homosexuality, and it rejected the Boy 
Scouts' contention that striking down their ban violates the 
group's First Amendment rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Davidson said he'll still argue First Amendment rights if the  
case reaches the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``The First Amendment trumps the state public accommodations  
laws,'' Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale earned 30 merit badges, seven achievement honors and other  
awards, and was an Eagle Scout during his 12 years in the 
organization. He was expelled by the Monmouth Council in 1990 after 
the group learned from a newspaper article that he was gay. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale said he would like to return to the Boy Scouts, but the  
promised appeals will likely stall that. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was growing up, I didn't know I was gay, but the Boy  
Scouts made me feel good about who I was,'' Dale said. ``Whether or 
not they know it, the Boy Scouts do wonderful things for gay kids 
across the country.''

<HEADLINE> Fringe Sports Shine at Pan Am Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Water skiing, racquetball, roller  
skating. Sounds like a day at Club Med, but it's actually the Pan 
American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking for some exposure as well as some legitimacy, six  
non-Olympic sports joined such stalwarts as basketball, boxing and 
track in the sports lineup at Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Asian Games can have kabaddi (full-contact tag) and sepak  
takraw (foot volleyball), the Pan Ams can have bowling and squash. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a perception amongst the public of a weekend  
cottager, have a few beers, go out on weekends and have some fun,'' 
said Ross Outerbridge, who chairs the High Performance Committee of 
Water Ski Canada. ``One thing that is difficult is to convince 
people of the perception of how difficult it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each Olympics usually reserves some place for a local sport or  
activity. But these competitors are more than weekend warriors. In 
nearly every sport, a pro circuit exists in which the top 
performers can earn more than $100,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor are these sports free of drug controversies. Canadian roller  
hockey goaltender Steve Vezina tested positive for three banned 
substances, including an anabolic steroid, and cost his country the 
gold medal at these Pan Ams. 
</P>
<P>
	The six non-Olympic sports contested at Winnipeg are: water  
skiing, racketball, roller sports, bowling, squash and karate. 
</P>
<P>
	In many cases, these sports struggle with their image. Take  
bowling, which conjures visions of middle-aged men in loud, loose 
shirts, smoking and drinking beer, 
</P>
<P>
	``I always tell our guys: `The best thing about your sport is  
everybody can do it. The worst thing about your sport is, everybody 
can do it,''' said Marc Whitney, press officer for the U.S. bowling 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Roller skating is stuck with an image of bikini-clad women  
gliding along Venice Beach in California. 
</P>
<P>
	``True, but how many times to do you see a highly trained  
athlete going backward down the street with a boom box on his 
shoulder?'' asked Maxine McKenzie, Canada's roller sports team 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly all thse competitors realize this is their chance to  
shine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Walking around the (athletes) village I haven't seen anybody  
who isn't excited,'' Canada racquetball coach Ron Brown said. ``But 
we're doubly excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If nothing else, the Pan Ams offer a rare chance for officials  
of the fringe sports to lobby IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	International Bowling Federation president Jerry Koenig has been  
working for years to get his sport recognized by the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	He went so far as to hold a bowling party at the 1998 Winter  
Olympics in Nagano, Japan, where he challenged IOC president Juan 
Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last time we bowled, he won one, and I won one,'' Koenig said.  
``We have handicapping in our sport, so I'm obligated to give him a 
few pins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if a sport wants to convince the IOC of its merits, this is  
the time and place. In 1995, in the Pan Am Games in Argentina, 
water skiing was held some 500 miles from the main sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having the sport within the city limits, within access of the  
fans, the media, the officials is tremendous for us,'' said 
Outerbridge of Water Ski Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The Athens Olympic Organizing Committee has proposed adding  
water skiing for the 2004 Games. Of course, it's also asked the IOC 
to consider fin swimming, in which racers don a mermaidlike tail.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rally Fails; Dow Drops 2.54 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks collapsed in the final  
half-hour of trading Wednesday, deflating a rally fueled by a $9.3 
billion merger of Dow Chemical and Union Carbide. The broader 
market, plagued by fears of inflation, declined much more steeply. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.54 points to close at  
10,674.77. The Dow, following what is becoming a familiar pattern, 
gave up nearly all its gains late in the day and wiped out what had 
been a 152-point gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Other market indicators fared worse. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
fell 16.85 to 1,305.33, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 47.99 
to 2,540.00. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the market fell prey to continuing worries that  
the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in an attempt to 
stave off inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market has gone from an emphasis on corporate earnings,  
which provided good news, to a hunt for signs of inflation,'' said 
Philip S. Dow, director of equity strategy at Dain Rauscher Wessels 
in Minneapolis. ``That's hurting stocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of higher interest rates continued to hit  
high-priced technology companies the hardest. The Nasdaq, which is 
dominated by technology stocks, ended today's session 11.3 percent 
below its July 16 record of 2,864.48. Traditionally, Wall Street 
considers a drop of at least 10 percent a correction, a milestone 
symbolizing weakness in markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet bookseller Amazon.com fell 6 7/16 to 88 7/16, while  
online auctioneer eBay dropped 8 5/8 to 75 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some new valuations for Internet stocks are being tested,''  
Dow said, suggesting that the shares are returning to prices that 
more accurately reflect their future earnings potential. 
</P>
<P>
	For most of the day, the Dow appeared well-equipped to buck the  
weakness in the broader market, even as most of its gains came from 
one component, Union Carbide. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Chemical said it will buy Union Carbide, creating the No. 2  
chemical company behind DuPont. Union Carbide soared 10 9/16 to 
59 3/8, while Dow Chemical fell 6 1/16 to 118 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies that make basic materials like chemicals and  
paper rose as well. International Paper, another stock in the Dow 
average, gained 2 15/16 to 54 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	But traders and analysts didn't trust the rally, and by  
afternoon, most Dow stocks ended lower. Financial companies, which 
are highly vulnerable to interest-rate concerns, led the decline. 
JP Morgan lost 3 3/16 to 124 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is lacking any conviction,'' said Richard Cripps,  
chief market strategist for Legg Mason in Baltimore. ``The market 
lacks any real incentives for buyers to come in, and some selling 
pressure definitely remains.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices, which have tumbled amid the growing belief that the  
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates, recovered Wednesday as 
the Treasury Department said it would reduce bond sales and 
proposed a buyback of part of the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.12  
percent from 6.16 percent late Tuesday. But analysts say the yield 
remains high enough to lure some investors away from stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were expected to stay in a fairly narrow range through  
Friday, when the Labor Department releases its monthly unemployment 
report. The report is expected to offer the latest indication of 
whether wage pressures are escalating enough to persuade the Fed to 
raise rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Even then, stocks may continue to falter until the Fed makes its  
decision at an August 24 meeting, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only good news for this market is that it is oversold,''  
said Cripps. ``That could leave us ripe for a pretty good rally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. Composite volume totaled 946.60 million 
shares, compared with 885.63 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 7.94 to 614.46, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 3.52 to 776.95. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 6.58 to 429.70. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.58 percent.  
European indexes were mixed, as Germany's DAX index was up 0.2 
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 0.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 
fell 0.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Skinhead Describes Death of Gay Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKFORD, Ala. (AP) -- A skinhead who pleaded guilty to killing a  
gay man testified Wednesday that his co-defendant did not strike 
the fatal blows, but did join him in a scheme to lure the victim to 
a remote area with the promise of sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Eric Mullins said he plotted to kill Billy Jack Gaither  
to steal his money and because the gay man made a pass at him. He 
said he invited Charles M. Butler Jr., to help because he ``didn't 
like queers either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mullins, 25, has pleaded guilty to capital murder in the Feb. 19  
beating death of Gaither, 39, who was beaten with an ax handle and 
had his throat cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler, 21, admitted to police that he helped Mullins burn  
Gaither's body atop a pile of old tires and set Gaither's car afire 
to destroy evidence, but he blamed Mullins for the murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Mullins, an imposing 6-foot-1 and 200 pounds, has the shaved  
head of a skinhead and ``SS'' tattooed on his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a racial tattoo. It's a skinhead tattoo,'' he testified.  
</P>
<P>
	Mullins, who had served 2 1/2 years in prison for burglary and  
forgery, said he made plans to kill Gaither after being 
propositioned, and invited Butler along. He said he told Gaither 
they were going to have sex. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are you telling these ladies and gentlemen that one of the  
reasons you set Billy Jack Gaither up was because he was gay?'' 
defense attorney Billy Hill asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes sir,'' Mullins replied.  
</P>
<P>
	``And you hate gays?''  
</P>
<P>
	``Yes sir.''  
</P>
<P>
	Before Mullins took the witness stand, Butler's father, Charles  
M. Butler Sr., said his son returned home around 3 a.m. and started 
crying and recounting the slaying of Gaither. ``He said, `We just 
killed a fellow,''' the father told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement to police in March, the father quoted his son as  
saying, ``I kicked a queer's ass.''

<HEADLINE> Buchanan May Leave Republican Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pat Buchanan, the pugnacious conservative  
whose insurgent presidential campaigns hobbled Republican 
front-runners in 1992 and 1996, is considering bolting to the 
Reform Party, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A major factor in his decision, which is not expected until the  
fall, will be the results of an Aug. 14 contest in Iowa testing the 
political strength of nine Republican presidential candidates, said 
officials close to Buchanan and in the Reform Party. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity, said  
Buchanan is worried that the Republican nomination process is 
geared in favor of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, and that he has 
little chance of winning or even pushing his social and economic 
issues to the forefront of the debate. 
</P>
<P>
	They say the candidate's sister, Bay Buchanan, has talked  
informally to a Reform Party official in recent weeks about a 
possible move. Such a step would be personally difficult for the 
former Nixon White House aide because of his long ties to the 
Republican Party, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders worry that a Buchanan defection would drain  
support of the GOP's most conservative voters from the party's 
eventual nominee. Already, conservative Sen. Bob Smith of New 
Hampshire has abandoned the Republican Party for a third-party run 
at the White House. Buchanan defended him against criticism from 
GOP leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the party that stands for the conservative principles  
that Pat Buchanan has articulated so well throughout his life,'' 
Republican National Committee spokesman Mike Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors have circulated for weeks that Buchanan may switch  
parties, and his campaign has refused to rule out the option. 
Interviews Wednesday with a half dozen officials familiar with the 
discussions produced the strongest evidence yet that Buchanan is 
seriously considering the move. 
</P>
<P>
	In a little-noticed television interview last month, Buchanan  
complained that the GOP establishment had decided that he was not a 
viable candidate. ``If they slam those doors shut,'' he warned, 
``we'll just have to look for another way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Associates said the interview was a warning that Buchanan was  
willing to abandon his party. 
</P>
<P>
	More recently, his sister talked with Pat Choate, a family  
friend and 1996 Reform Party vice presidential candidate, about the 
possibility of Buchanan leaving the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan declined to return telephone calls. His sister said the  
candidate was focused on the Iowa straw vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been no further development whatsoever'' since the  
TV interview ``when Pat said quite clearly that he will follow his 
ideas,'' Bay Buchanan said in a telephone interview from Montana, 
where she is vacationing. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan would not be assured of the presidential nomination in  
the fractious Reform Party. Backers of Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura 
have wrested the party leadership from associates of party founder 
Ross Perot. 
</P>
<P>
	While Perot supporters such as Choate and past chairman Russell  
Verney would welcome Buchanan to the party, Ventura has been cool 
to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reform Party nominee will have access to more than $12  
million in federal funding, millions more than Buchanan is expected 
to raise as a GOP candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Bay Buchanan's discussion with Choate took place shortly after  
the July 23 Reform Party convention. She left no doubt that 
Buchanan may leave the GOP if he isn't satisfied with the 
nominating process, according to two people well versed on the 
conversation,. 
</P>
<P>
	They described the conversation as informal, part of a long  
series of discussions between friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan still hopes to do well in the GOP-sponsored Iowa straw  
poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Though non-binding, the contest could determine the fate of  
Buchanan and other second-tier candidates including former Vice 
President Dan Quayle and former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	A poor showing would weaken Buchanan's standing in the GOP  
field, raising questions about whether he continue the Republican 
race, close down the campaign or seek the Reform Party nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, who left CNN to launch his third presidential campaign  
in March, is a fiery orator with a potent blend of politics: He is 
conservative on social issues yet appeals to populist instincts on 
economic matter such as trade. 
</P>
<P>
	He beat eventual nominee Bob Dole in the New Hampshire primary  
four years ago and put a scare into President Bush in 1992, 
finishing a close second. 
</P>
<P>
	Both times, Buchanan soon ran out of money and votes.  
</P>
<P>
	This year's campaign is a pale imitation of his past efforts. He  
is drawing smaller crowds, working with a staff that is smaller and 
less experienced and, at times, appears to be just going through 
the paces on the stump.

<HEADLINE> Steelers Hope To Restore QB Stewart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LATROBE, Pa. (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Steelers are doing a lot of  
construction work these days, and not all of it is taking place at 
their new stadium site. 
</P>
<P>
	They're also trying to rebuild a quarterback.  
</P>
<P>
	The restoration of Kordell Stewart began last winter, deep in  
the midsection of Three Rivers Stadium's windowless coaching 
offices. They started with a series of get-acquainted meetings with 
new offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride, then progressed into 
on-field sessions aimed not just at restoring Stewart's on-field 
ingenuity, but also his confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of all, his confidence.  
</P>
<P>
	Stewart wasn't the same quarterback in 1998 that he was in 1997,  
when he led the Steelers to within four points of the Super Bowl in 
his first season as a starter. Small wonder the Steelers weren't 
the same team, missing the playoffs for the first time since 1991 
with a 7-9 record and losing their final five games. 
</P>
<P>
	Exit former offensive coordinator Ray Sherman, who now finds  
himself running the NFL's most prolific offense in Minnesota. Enter 
Gilbride, a former NFL head coach and offensive coordinator whose 
success -- or failure -- will be determined largely by Kordell 
Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	The progress report one week into training camp: nothing  
dramatic yet, but everything seems on course. 
</P>
<P>
	``You start off pretty much with the basics and, at this point,  
you're running the plays everybody is familiar with,'' Stewart said 
Wednesday. ``As times progress, you start adding things here and 
there, and that's when the mind starts scrambling for some air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That Stewart is scrambling at all is a sign the offense has  
changed. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Sherman restricted Stewart's propensity for rolling  
out of the pocket and creating on the fly, partly to cut down on 
interceptions. Stewart was restricted mostly to the pocket, a 
quarterback forced to rely more on his ability to read defenses and 
much less on his improvisational skills. 
</P>
<P>
	To say it was a dismal failure would be an understatement.  
</P>
<P>
	One season after producing 32 touchdowns, 21 on passes and 11 on  
runs, he threw for 11 touchdowns and ran for two, a nearly 
two-thirds dropoff in touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Gilbride is in the process of opening up the offense by  
allowing Stewart and his receivers to adjust and react as a play is 
developing. The system demands that a quarterback and his receivers 
always be on the same wavelength, but also creates the possibility 
of more big plays. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Steelers had only one scoring pass play longer  
than 50 yards all season. With no fear the Steelers would strike 
for a big play, defenses stacked the line of scrimmage to contain 
the run, causing Jerome Bettis' yardage to drop from 1,665 yards in 
1997 to 1,185 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a scrimmage Tuesday against the Washington Redskins,  
Stewart found first-round draft choice Troy Edwards open several 
times for big yardage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a long way from being perfect,'' Gilbride said. ``There  
were a lot of mistakes, but there were a lot of good plays. I 
thought Kordell threw the ball well and made some pretty good 
reads. Some receivers stepped up big and made some big catches for 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards' legs may not yet be in top condition -- he quickly ran  
out of gas during wind sprints last week -- but there is nothing 
wrong with his hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bill Cowher quickly picked up on how Stewart and his  
receivers seem to be acclimating themselves to Gilbride's system. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a real comfort level that is taking place,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	That in itself is a major change, considering how uncomfortable  
Stewart seemed last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The receivers are doing more reading, giving the quarterback  
more of an opportunity to make some plays,'' Stewart said. 
``Whatever coverage they get, they can do whatever they want. They 
can work inside, they can work outside, there is a lot going on 
right now. So you will see more of a flashier offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pretty soon, it will be an automatic thing and, once that time  
comes, that's when everything will be rolling real smooth.''

<HEADLINE> Knee Sidelines Jets' Eric Green </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. -- For Bill Parcells, finding a fourth receiver  
is a minor hurdle. Sifting through the roster for pass-rusher is a 
test of patience. But Eric Green's knee is a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	After five straight days of two-a-day workouts, the veteran  
tight end was excused from training-camp sessions Tuesday afternoon 
and Wednesday with a sore left knee. The development had New York 
Jets coach Parcells sounding an alarm bell. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Eric Green can't play, we're going to have big problems,''  
Parcells said. ``It would impact us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former two-time Pro Bowler, who signed a four-year, $7.5  
million free-agent contract with the Jets during the offseason, is 
being counted on to fill the void created when Kyle Brady left for 
the Jacksonville Jaguars. Green, 32, underwent arthroscopic surgery 
on his knee following last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the Jets nor Green would reveal the exact nature of the  
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just one of those knees that's been around a long time,''  
said Green, who played with Baltimore the past three seasons. In 
that span, he stressed, the Ravens never required him to take part 
in two-a-day workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm new, and this is something I wanted to gauge and see how  
(the knee) responds,'' Green said. ``It's not all bad, though. I 
got some great things down at camp. These guys need to learn what 
kind of player I really am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells would like that, too, but is frustrated to find Green  
already sidelined in pain. Neither Fred Baxter nor Lawrence Hart, 
backups to Green, have wowed the Jets staff thus far in workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Green, who made the Pro Bowl in 1993 and 1994 with the  
Pittsburgh Steelers, missed four games last season with injuries, 
most unrelated to the knee. He finished with 422 yards on 34 
catches, with one touchdown. Over the past two seasons, he has 99 
receptions for 1,023 yards and six scores. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets hope that the 6-5, 279-pound veteran becomes more of a  
downfield receiving threat than Brady, and provides a powerful 
blocking presence for running back Curtis Martin. Parcells admits 
to being worried, however. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no choice,'' Parcells said of keeping Green off the  
field. ``It's going to make him dysfunctional if I keep going. So, 
I'll give him a couple of days off. 
</P>
<P>
	Green, who continually downplayed his knee problems Wednesday,  
declined to reveal how many surgeries have been performed on the 
troublesome joint. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells admitted that the team knew Green was battling a  
long-standing knee problem, but, ``I didn't know it was quite like 
this.'' If the tight end is unavailable, ``There's nobody out there 
to look for,'' the coach added. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're making a bit of a mountain here, though. If he's still  
not practicing two weeks from now, then we'll definitely have 
problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green doesn't see that happening.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's getting better,'' he said. ``I'm going to have days like  
this. I don't see any long-term effects. I'm not worried at all.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Fall in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks fell early Thursday, pushed down by  
a decline on Wall Street and the dollar's slide against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 114.38 yen, down 0.72 yen from late Wednesday  
in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 114.29 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average 214.75 points, or  
1.21 percent, to 17,470.63 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On 
Wednesday, the average closed down 284.55 points, or 1.58 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Among early losers were high-technology issues and blue chips,  
including Sony, TDK, NEC and Toyota Motor. They were sold in line 
with falls in the technology-rich U.S. Nasdaq composite index, 
which dropped 47.99 points to 2,540.00 at Wednesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average lost  
2.54 points to 10,674.77. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors in Tokyo were also discouraged by the yen's strength  
against the greenback. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen reduces the profits of Japanese exporters by  
making their products more expensive abroad and less competitive, 
while reducing their dollar-denominated revenues when translated 
into yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers gave the  
dollar an early boost to 114.57 yen earlier in the session, but 
U.S. funds stepped in to take profits, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with the BBC late Wednesday, Summers reiterated  
America's strong dollar policy, but there was no specific 
suggestion that U.S.-Japan joint dollar-buying intervention in 
currency markets was planned. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 14.97 points, or 1.03 percent, to 1,444.70. 
The TOPIX closed down 22.32 points, or 1.51 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 122.98 yen, down  
from 124.12 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell  
to 1.8500 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.8850 percent, 
driving its price up to 99.57 yen from 99.27 yen.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Close Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stock prices closed lower today mainly on  
selling of shares in large Japanese exporters. The dollar declined 
against the yen in late-afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 284.55 points,  
or 1.58 percent, to close at 17,685.38. On Tuesday, the average 
finished up 144.23 points, or 0.81 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.10 yen at late-afternoon, down 0.30 yen  
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level 
of 115.28 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices fell on continued investor concern  
that the yen's strength against the dollar will hurt Japanese 
exporters, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	A higher yen makes Japanese exports more expensive abroad and  
thus less competitive, and reduces the dollar-denominated earnings 
of Japanese exporters when translated into yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors are worried that the yen may continue to  
strengthen,'' said Hideyuki Okoshi, deputy manager at Chuo 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The overnight plunge in the Nasdaq Composite Index also weighed  
on Tokyo stocks today. The Index tumbled 35.64 points to 2,587.99 
Tuesday in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section closed down 22.32 points, or 1.51 percent, to 
1,459.67. The TOPIX closed up 13.37 points, or 0.91 percent, the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 472.32 million shares, down from 490.50 million shares 
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Retreating issues outnumbered advancing stocks 839 to 361 while  
116 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, traders sold the dollar, ignoring hints  
from Japan's government that it may carry out dollar-buying 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will think of appropriate measures at every turn of  
events,'' Zembei Mizoguchi, director-general of the international 
bureau at Japan's Ministry of Finance, told reporters today. 
</P>
<P>
	Expectations of intervention emerged after Finance Minister  
Kiichi Miyazawa and U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers agreed 
in phone talks Tuesday that they will maintain close ties on 
foreign exchange policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said, however, that there has been no indication of any  
joint intervention since the two officials spoke the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, the Bank of Japan has bought dollars to stop  
the yen's rise against the greenback, an action meant to help the 
country's nascent economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 124.12 yen, up from  
123.08 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.8900 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.8800 
percent, driving its price down to 99.23 yen from 99.32 yen.

<HEADLINE> Suns Close To Deal for Hardaway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Phoenix Suns are closing in on a deal with  
would bring Penny Hardaway from the Orlando Magic in a 
sign-and-trade arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns have intensified conversations with the Magic and  
Hardaway just as other NBA teams, including the Los Angeles Lakers 
and Toronto Raptors, have backed off. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida Today quoted Magic general manager John Gabriel as  
saying the Suns' deal is ``the only trade left out there.'' The 
remaining option for Orlando would be to try to keep Hardaway with 
the Magic to play for new coach Doc Rivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway was in Phoenix last Friday and Saturday, met with team  
officials, and played golf with coach Danny Ainge. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix radio station KMGE reported Tuesday night that the deal  
was completed, but Suns president Jerry Colangelo said nothing was 
final. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be premature to say anything about a deal that's  
done,'' Colangelo said late Tuesday night. ``We've had a lot of 
conversation with his agent and with Orlando, but I can't confirm 
to you that a deal is done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reports that the deal was imminent surfaced in Arizona and  
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orlando Sentinal and The Tribune of Mesa reported that the  
Suns would send Pat Garrity, Danny Manning and two draft picks to 
the Magic in exchange for Hardaway. The Arizona Republic quoted 
league sources and a source close to Hardaway as saying he has told 
the Suns he wants to play in Phoenix and has agreed to contract 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic want a sign-and-trade deal, even one that might not  
bring the kind of value they think Hardaway is worth, in order to 
get some compensation for losing the four-time all-star guard. 
</P>
<P>
	A sign-and-trade deal is the only way the Suns could get  
Hardaway, because they have no room under the salary cap to sign 
him outright as a free agent, a situation similar to most other 
teams in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old guard has averaged 19 points in his six NBA  
seasons, but dropped to 15.8 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando is in the midst of a roster overhaul under new coach Doc  
Rivers. The Magic traded Nick Anderson to Sacramento on Tuesday for 
Tariq Abdul-Wahad and a first-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	According to The Tribune, while Hardaway was in Phoenix,  
Colangelo presented him with a set of golf clubs in a purple golf 
bag with Hardaway's name and the Phoenix Suns stitched into it. 
It's the kind of gesture Colangelo is known for in his successful 
attempts to attract athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers removed themselves from the Hardaway sweepstakes when  
they reached a seven-year, $30 million agreement with Derek Fisher.

<HEADLINE> Korean IOC Member Mum on Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A powerful South Korean Olympic  
official refused to comment today on a criminal case implicating 
his son in Salt Lake City's bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	A businessman pleaded guilty to tax fraud Tuesday, saying he  
helped the son of Kim Un-yong, an executive member of the 
International Olympic Committee, obtain lawful permanent resident 
status by setting up a sham job at his now-defunct communications 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Kim Un-yong cannot comment until he reviews all the  
details on the case,'' his chief secretary, Baek Sung-il, said. 
``But he is not too concerned about the latest development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The secretary distributed copies of a statement Kim's American  
lawyer, Howard Graff, issued right after the guilty plea in the 
first criminal case stemming from the U.S. federal investigation 
into Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is indeed unfortunate that by implication, Dr. Kim has once  
again been dragged into a story concerning the alleged misdeeds of 
others,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	David E. Simmons, the businessman, has admitted that he used  
fake contracts and phony invoices to conceal the fact that John 
Kim's salary was being paid by the Salt Lake City Olympic bid 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal, he said, was to win support for the city's quest for  
the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, a member of the IOC's ruling executive board and president  
of an international confederation of Olympic sports, has denied any 
wrongdoing in the Salt Lake City scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	He has said that his son worked with Simmons on purely business  
terms and that he was unaware of any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten IOC members either resigned or were expelled for receiving  
cash and other improper inducements from the Salt Lake City 
committee trying to win the right to hold the Olympics in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	An IOC probe ruled Kim's case as minor and closed the case with  
a ``severe warning'' to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Graff's statement said the arrangements for reimbursing Simmons  
by the bidders were kept secret from the family. Court documents 
released Tuesday offered no evidence that the elder Kim knew about 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	An IOC spokesman refused to comment, saying it would be  
``inappropriate'' because ``the proceedings are ongoing in the 
United States.''

<HEADLINE> Korean IOC Member Reviewing Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A South Korean Olympic executive is  
not worried about tax fraud allegations that have touched on his 
son, arising out of the selection of Salt Lake City for the 2002 
Winter Olympics, a spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involving John Kim, the son of Kim Un-yong, is the  
first criminal prosecution by U.S. federal investigators over 
allegations that Salt Lake City officials illegally tried to 
influence Olympic delegates selecting the games' venue. 
</P>
<P>
	A businessman from Utah pleaded guilty to misdemeanor tax fraud  
Tuesday, admitting that he helped John Kim obtain permanent U.S. 
resident status by setting up a fake job at his now-defunct 
communications company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Kim Un-yong cannot comment until he reviews all the  
details on the case,'' his chief secretary, Baek Sung-il, said in 
the South Korean capital, Seoul. ``But he is not too concerned 
about the latest development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Kim, an IOC executive member, has denied any  
wrongdoing in the bidding scandal. He has previously said the money 
Simmons paid his son was for consulting and other services and had 
nothing to do with the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The businessman, David E. Simmons, has admitted that he used  
fake contracts and phony invoices to conceal the fact that John 
Kim's salary was being paid by the Salt Lake City Olympic Bid 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC official has said any deal between Simmons and the Salt  
Lake City bid committee was kept secret from his family. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake City scandal has never loomed large in South  
Korea, where senior government officials are routinely jailed on 
bribery charges. It has received little coverage in the news media. 
</P>
<P>
	President Kim Dae-jung's office said it was following Kim's case  
but there has been no probe or questioning by the South Korean 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's own investigation in March gave Kim Un-yong a ``severe  
warning'' for his conduct, but stopped short of harsher sanctions 
in the inquiry that led to an unprecedented 10 expulsions or 
resignations.

cited as a candidate to replace Juan Antonio Samaranch as IOC chief 
in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: No Excuse for Infidelity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today he makes no  
excuses for his marital infidelity, and neither does his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	It was his first public reaction to Hillary Rodham Clinton's  
much-discussed magazine interview, in which she drew an apparent 
link between the tumult of Clinton's childhood and what she 
described as his ``weakness'' and lack of self-control as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe that anybody could fairly read the article and  
think that she was making any excuses for me,'' Clinton said today. 
``I have not made any excuses for what was inexcusable, and neither 
has she, believe me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a Senate campaign visit to Jamestown, N.Y., Mrs. Clinton  
said today that she did not mean to imply in the interview with 
Talk magazine that the president's childhood problems were to blame 
for his infidelity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is responsible for their behavior and I am a very  
strong proponent and believer in personal responsibility, so I hope 
that people will take that message away from this,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she believes that the country has put the issue behind  
it. ``I have as well,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My husband and I love each other very much,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said today that thoughtful readers of the article will  
conclude ``that my wife is an extraordinary person,'' with an 
impressive record of public service, ``and that we love each other 
very much. 
</P>
<P>
	His comments came at the close of a Rose Garden appearance on  
economic themes, including the GOP-passed tax cut bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking pensive, Clinton spoke carefully about his childhood in  
Arkansas, which was marked by family discord. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have a bed of roses as a kid,'' Clinton said. But he  
said he had what's most important for any youngster. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing is that every child needs to know  
growing up that he or she is the most important person in the world 
to someone,'' he said. ``And I knew that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I always knew that I was well-loved and I think that's  
important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton's spokeswoman, Marsha Barry, weighed in  
with a similar refrain. 
</P>
<P>
	``She did not say the president's childhood in any way caused  
his behavior, nor does she believe that,'' spokeswoman Marsha Barry 
said, seeking to clarify what Mrs. Clinton meant when she said in 
the magazine interview that her husband was ``scarred by abuse'' as 
a child. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, he has his weaknesses,'' Mrs. Clinton told the magazine.  
``Yes, he needs to be more responsible, more disciplined, but it is 
remarkable given his background that he turned out to be the kind 
of person he is, capable of such leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Expanding on her husband's background, Mrs. Clinton said what  
scarred him at age 4 was a struggle between his mother and 
grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
	``A psychologist once told me that for a boy being in the middle  
of a conflict between two women is the worst possible situation,'' 
she said. ``There is always a desire to please each one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's quotations were misinterpreted, Berry said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think that she was basically stating some feelings about his  
childhood, but that they do not excuse his behavior,'' Berry said.

<HEADLINE> Mexico 4, Brazil 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Two goals by Miguel Zepeda and one each by  
Jose Manuel Abundis and Cuauhtemoc Blanco lifted Mexico to a 4-3 
upset of Brazil Wednesday night in the championship game of the 
Confederations Cup soccer tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's goals came from Serginho, Roni and Ze Roberto.  
</P>
<P>
	Brazil, which didn't give up a goal in the first round, seemed  
to fall apart defensively in the final. Evanilson, a key defender, 
was injured in the semifinal match against Saudi Arabia and 
couldn't play. 
</P>
<P>
	Azteca Stadium itself was also a major advantage to the  
Mexicans. Brazil had played all its previous games in the western 
city of Guadalajara. Mexico hasn't lost to another national team at 
Azteca in 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The capacity crowd of 110,000 throbbed with energy, beating on  
drums, blowing horns and showering the field in confetti in a 
deafening celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 12th minute, Zepeda's hard drive bounced off goalkeeper  
Dida's hands and over his head into the net. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico's second goal came in the 27th minute, when Abundis got  
free on the right side of the penalty box and fired in a pass from 
Blanco. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 43rd minute, German Villa tripped up Ronaldinho as he  
tried to shoot and Serginho made the penalty kick to cut Mexico's 
lead to 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil got even in the first minute of the second half when Roni  
converted a pass from Ronaldinho. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico took the lead again in the 48th minute, when Zepeda  
scored off a pass from Abundis, and made it 4-2 in the 61st minute 
when Blanco dribbled around defenders and crossed a shot into the 
net. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a minute later, Roni centered a pass to Ze Roberto, who  
drove it into the goal to make it 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico played for time after that, mounting a tight defense that  
Brazil couldn't penetrate.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Visits Phoenix Inmates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Mike Tyson was back among the incarcerated -- but  
this time, he was just visiting. 
</P>
<P>
	The ex-inmate and former heavyweight champion was supposed to  
promote Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio's tent city, where 
approximately 1,000 nonviolent inmates serve their sentences in 
tents. 
</P>
<P>
	But the parolee was less than complimentary when he saw it.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's too much like slavery,'' Tyson said Tuesday when he saw  
a dozen inmates with their ankles chained together. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson then joked that he was ``proud to see an all-white chain  
gang'' for once. He later apologized. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was recently released from a Maryland jail after serving a  
sentence for assaulting two motorists, and has served prison time 
in Indiana for rape. On Tuesday, he handed out doughnuts in 
100-degree weather to the inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people come in here because they can't manage their  
lives,'' Tyson said. ``They need skills to cope with society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the inmates asked Tyson to sign autographs on pieces of  
the doughnut boxes they ripped apart.

<HEADLINE> Briggs, Botha Talk a Good Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Shannon Briggs sizes up Francois  
Botha as nothing more than a washed-up fighter. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're too slow, you have no power,'' he said Wednesday. ``You  
can't move your head. You fought all bums your whole career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two heavyweights, doing their best to pump pay-per-view and  
ticket sales with trash talk, meet in a 10-round nontitle fight 
Saturday at Trump Taj Mahal. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha, the former IBF heavyweight titleholder, didn't want to  
hear any of Briggs' opinions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter whether you bring all these guys (Briggs'  
corner men) in here to scare me. The baddest man on the planet 
couldn't do it. What makes you think you can?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha, a 30-year-old South African living in Newport Beach,  
Calif., once fought three matches in one day. In 1992, he defeated 
Art Hooks, Russell Pierson and Mike Jones -- knocking each one out 
in the first round -- in Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, he won the IBF title with a unanimous decision over  
Axel Schulz, but a month later the bout was ruled a no contest 
after Botha's drug test showed steroids. 
</P>
<P>
	More recently, he led Mike Tyson on all three judges' cards in  
the fifth round of their Jan. 26 bout. Tyson knocked him out with 
one punch to win it. His other loss was to Michael Moorer. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha (39-2), fighting for the first time since the Tyson bout,  
says Briggs has no endurance. 
</P>
<P>
	``He starts early and he burns out in the later rounds,'' Botha  
said. ``I want to get him tired, work the body and take him out 
later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Briggs, a 27-year-old New Yorker, and Botha both want a shot at  
Tyson. Briggs also hopes for an eventual rematch with WBC champion 
Lennox Lewis, who stopped him in five rounds last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Briggs (31-2) hasn't fought since last December, when he scored  
a first-round TKO over Marcus Rhode. But he says he's in prime 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	This bout could be crossroads for both fighters.  
</P>
<P>
	``These two guys, neither one of them can afford to lose,'' said  
Emanuel Steward, Briggs' trainer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The winner has a great future in front of him,'' co-promoter  
Frank Warren said. ``And the loser has nowhere to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each fighter will get $400,000. The bout will be carried on a 9  
p.m. pay-per-view telecast by Showtime Event Television.

<HEADLINE> Reds Release Pitcher Jason Bere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Jason Bere's attempt to rejuvenate his career  
with the Cincinnati Reds ended Wednesday when he was released so he 
could try to find another team. 
</P>
<P>
	Bere, 28, was struggling at Triple-A Indianapolis, where he was  
trying to come back from a sore elbow that landed him on the 
disabled list June 16. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander was relegated to pitching in relief for  
Indianapolis and felt there would be no opportunity to make it back 
to the Reds' rotation. His agent, Tom Tanzer, and Reds general 
manager Jim Bowden agreed on his unconditional release. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no hard feelings here,'' Tanzer said. ``Jim gave Jason  
a lot of opportunities and basically he didn't pitch good and 
they've got to try to win a pennant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds claimed Bere off waivers from the Chicago White Sox on  
July 21 last year, when he was trying to recover from an elbow 
injury that sidelined him for most of the 1996-97 seasons. He made 
seven starts for the Reds and was impressive at the end, going 2-1 
with a 1.69 ERA in his final three starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Figuring he was making progress in his recovery, the Reds signed  
him to a $1.2 million contract for 1999 and counted him in the 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he had a 6.85 ERA in 10 starts and two relief  
appearances. He walked 40 in 43 1-3 innings and opposing batters 
hit .326 off of him. He lost his spot in the rotation and his elbow 
became inflamed after he made two appearances out of the bullpen, 
prompting the move to the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems continued when he started his rehab assignment. He  
was 0-2 in four starts and one relief appearance with a 10.19 ERA, 
walking 19 in 17 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds moved two of their young prospects into the Triple-A  
rotation, leaving Bere to pitch in relief and setting the stage for 
his departure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought he was healthy (this season) because if Jason  
was healthy, he would be able to throw more strikes than he has,'' 
Bowden said. ``Jason had made progress last year and regressed. I 
felt all along he was hurt, but he says he's not. We wish him 
nothing but the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tanzer said Bere will likely pitch at Triple-A for some other  
club with the hope of getting called up in September. He said the 
Reds were kind to let him pursue other opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	``They gave him a lot of chances,'' Tanzer said. ``It just  
didn't work out. The Reds couldn't have done anything more than 
they did. They were very accommodating.''

<HEADLINE> American Alters Frequent Flier Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- American Airlines' frequent flier miles  
could go a lot farther under the air carrier's new, looser 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline said Wednesday its frequent  
flier miles will last indefinitely as long as passengers use their 
accounts every three years. That means the 35 million people 
enrolled in American's AAdvantage program may not ever see mileage 
expire as long as they continue to accrue or use points. 
</P>
<P>
	``All you really have to do is have some activity within 36  
months,'' said Henry Joyner, vice president of marketing for AMR 
Corp., the parent company of American. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, frequent flier miles had a shelf life of about three  
years, depending on the program. 
</P>
<P>
	American's decision follows Northwest Airlines similar  
announcement in January. Delta Air Lines had dropped most of its 
expiration requirements three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines remains the only major carrier that has  
expiration dates. 
</P>
<P>
	``United does have non-expiring rules with their elite  
programs,'' said Randy Peterson, editor of InsideFlyer magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone messages left with United were not returned.  
</P>
<P>
	Frequent flier programs have been a powerful tool for creating  
customer loyalty for the airlines. The miles are used as a virtual 
currency with the airlines redeemable for such things as plane 
tickets, travel packages and hotel stays. Over the last several 
years, program participants have been able to earn miles on the 
ground in almost endless ways. Phone companies, grocers, car rental 
agencies and credit cards offer miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The way mileage is now accrued is partially why airlines are  
dropping their expiration dates. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in 1988 when frequent flier programs were introduced  
literally all mile accrual came from flying. Today, companies buy 
miles from the airlines to give to customers, making the programs 
lucrative for carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Close to half of miles today comes from other program  
activity,'' said Peterson. ``Essentially the airline is being 
prepaid for each seat.''

<HEADLINE> Canucks Sign Free Agent Doug Bodger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The Vancouver Canucks  
bolstered their young blueline, signing veteran Doug Bodger to a 
reported one-year contract on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	An unrestricted free agent, Bodger had three goals and 11  
assists in 65 games with the Los Angeles Kings last season. The 
33-year-old defenseman, who grew up on nearby Vancouver Island, 
reportedly signed a deal that will pay him $700,000 plus bonuses, 
almost half of the $1.3 million he made last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doug is a solid player at the NHL level and he will add  
veteran leadership and depth to our defense,'' said Brian Burke, 
Canucks president and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Bodger, who played his 1,000th career game last season, is  
entering his 16th NHL campaign and joining his sixth club after 
breaking into the league with Pittsburgh in 1984. An all-around 
player, Bodger's best offensive season came in 1992-'93 when he had 
nine goals and a career-high 45 assists in 81 games. 
</P>
<P>
	He is expected to help nurture the Canucks' young but promising  
defensive corps, which includes Ed Jovanovski, Mattias Ohlund and 
top prospect Bryan Allen. Murray Baron, 32, is the only other 
Canuck defenseman over 26 years of age. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate move Wednesday, the Canucks also signed free-agent  
right winger Martin Gendron. A journeyman with only 30 NHL games 
under his belt over five pro seasons, Gendron led the Montreal 
Canadiens' American Hockey League farm club in Fredericton, New 
Brunswick with 33 goals and 67 points in 65 games last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gendron, 25, was Washington's fourth-round pick in the 1992  
draft, and played 20 games with the Capitals in 1995-'96.

<HEADLINE> Dixon Edwards Leaves Dolphins Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Veteran linebacker Dixon Edwards left the  
Miami Dolphins today and may sit out the season because of an 
irregular heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards, a starter the past six years for the Dallas Cowboys and  
Minnesota Vikings, signed with Miami as a free agent in June. He 
participated in the first three training camp workouts last week 
before the heart ailment sidelined him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has seen four different doctors and cardiologists, one in  
Dallas in February and three other doctors in South Florida,'' 
coach Jimmy Johnson said. ``All four have cleared him to practice 
and to play. All four have said he's got a healthy heart. For that 
reason, we're leaving the door open for him to return to the squad 
at a later date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards, 31, met with Johnson today before leaving camp. He  
agreed to return his signing bonus, so there will be no salary-cap 
implications for the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has concerns,'' Johnson said. ``He will be working with a  
nutritionist to try to alleviate his concerns, and so he could have 
a change of mind here at a later date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards has played for a playoff team in each of his eight NFL  
seasons. He was expected to challenge Derrick Rodgers for a 
starting job at outside linebacker.

<HEADLINE> Isiah Thomas New Owner of CBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Isiah Thomas has big plans for his little league.  
</P>
<P>
	At first interested in acquiring an expansion franchise for  
Detroit, Thomas instead wound up paying $10 million to purchase the 
entire Continental Basketball Association and its nine franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	And he believes it's a great deal.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great business opportunity if we can put the right  
operational structure in place,'' Thomas said. ``The most important 
thing is to concentrate on being the best minor league system 
around. The CBA has been here since 1946 and plans to be around 
until 2046.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas' CBA involvement began innocently enough when he inquired  
about putting a team in Detroit, where he led the Pistons to 
consecutive NBA championships in 1989 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The next thing he knew, he owned the whole league, with Detroit  
on the back burner as a possible future expansion team. Also 
mentioned as areas the CBA might look to in the future were 
southern California and suburban Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas plans to reorganize the CBA from an association with 40  
owners into a single entity league. 
</P>
<P>
	``The franchises will be owned by the league,'' Thomas said.  
``This new single entity model will eliminate the inefficiencies of 
current franchise ownership. Under the single entity model, the 
nine teams will report to the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the league will control all aspects of team operations from  
player negotiations to marketing to revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	From a personal standpoint, Thomas sees his CBA connection as a  
natural progression. 
</P>
<P>
	``This completes the cycle of basketball for me, touching all  
the aspects of basketball,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After a 13-year playing career with the Pistons, he became part  
owner and general manager of the expansion Toronto Raptors. Then he 
moved into broadcasting as an analyst on NBC's coverage of the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``My interest is purely in basketball remaining healthy and the  
game continuing to grow, and protecting the sanctity of the game we 
all love,'' Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas wants the CBA to continue its role as a developmental  
league, a training ground for future NBA players and officials. He 
would also like to see the league's teams become directly 
affiliated with NBA clubs, moving players up and down with single 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on his agenda are possible exhibition games for CBA teams  
against NCAA teams, much like preseason games currently played 
against teams like Athletes In Action and touring European clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's for the future.  
</P>
<P>
	For now Thomas wants to build what he has.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have one goal -- to be the second best league in the  
world,'' he said. ``As a minor league, a developmental league, 
we're not in the driver's seat. We're passengers. We bring to the 
table the ability to enhance the property in each city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All this developed out of Thomas' dream to own an NBA team. He  
was forced to back off because he could not compete with corporate 
bankrolls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not given up on the NBA dream,'' he said. ``I learned a  
long time ago if your pocketbook can't support your dreams, you 
need to look elsewhere.''

<HEADLINE> Ford Faces Possible UAW Showdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. faces a possible showdown in  
national contract talks with the United Auto Workers over the 
potential spinoff of the No. 2 automaker's Visteon Automotive 
Systems parts unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The union has scheduled an Aug. 17 strike-authorization vote at  
Ford plants nationwide. Though such votes are routine every three 
years before the UAW contracts with Detroit's automakers expire in 
September, holding one at all of a single company's locals on the 
same day is unusual. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the vote is meant to send a strong message to the  
No. 2 automaker, which has enjoyed relatively smooth relations with 
the UAW for more than 20 years but is feeling heat this year over 
Visteon. 
</P>
<P>
	The union opposes a spinoff, fearing it could bode poorly for  
its 28,500 members at Visteon. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote is ``a very slight wake-up call, just to signal that  
this is an important issue and that the union is absolutely 
prepared to strike, if necessary,'' labor Professor Harley Shaiken 
at the University of California-Berkeley said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A strike authorization vote does not necessarily mean there  
would be a strike. Union leaders are required to seek rank-and-file 
authorization before calling a walkout. Workers usually vote 
overwhelmingly in favor of a strike, typically as a show of support 
for their union negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW spokesman Paul Krell played down the vote, saying such  
balloting is ``always done at all locations in a very narrow window 
anyway.'' Similar votes are planned at General Motors Corp. and 
DaimlerChrysler AG plants, though not on a single day. 
</P>
<P>
	But he did not dismiss the importance of Visteon to the UAW,  
given union sentiments that job security for generations of 
autoworkers current and future ``are very much of paramount 
concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Pestillo, the Ford vice chairman who is the chief  
architect of the company's successful labor relations, declined to 
comment on whether UAW leaders were trying to send Ford a message. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll have to ask them how they feel about what they're doing  
there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW's strike vote comes as the union continues separate  
negotiations that began in June with DaimlerChrysler, GM and Ford. 
Their contracts expire Sept. 14, and talks are expected to 
intensify around Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford has not yet stated its plans for Visteon, but has said it's  
considering a spinoff. There also have been reports that Ford is 
considering merging Visteon with Lear Corp., another large parts 
maker. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressure for a spinoff has increased since GM distributed shares  
in its Delphi Automotive Systems parts unit to GM shareholders in 
May after an initial public offering in January. Delphi is the 
world's largest auto parts manufacturer, followed by Visteon.

<HEADLINE> Judge Puts Timber Sales on Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A federal judge has put nine federal timber sales  
in the Pacific Northwest on hold, saying the government failed to 
conduct wildlife surveys required under a landmark management plan 
for old-growth forests. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservationists said the ruling from U.S. District Judge  
William Dwyer represents an important step in protecting declining 
wildlife in the nation's last remaining old-growth forests. 
</P>
<P>
	``This reaffirms our allegation that the Forest Service and the  
(Bureau of Land Management) were putting logging activities ahead 
of their responsibilities to protect wildlife, fish, clean water 
and old-growth forests,'' Dave Werntz of the Northwest Ecosystem 
Alliance said in today's Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the 1994 Northwest Forest Plan, timber companies could  
continue logging provided there were sufficient protections for 
species that depended on old trees. The Clinton administration 
drafted the plan to free public lands from gridlock of the early 
1990s brought about by the legal battle over protection of the 
northern spotted owl. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dwyer said federal land managers had acted ``arbitrarily and  
contrary to the plain language'' of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plan's requirement that surveys be conducted cannot be  
dropped simply by the issuance of memoranda concluding that `field 
surveys are not needed,''' Dwyer wrote in the ruling issued Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling affects proposed sales involving nearly 100 million  
board feet, or about one-fifth of all timber set to be cut this 
year on the west side of the Cascade Range. It could affect timber 
sales across Washington, Oregon and California. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to try to try to figure out just what all this  
means and what our remedies may be,'' said Rex Holloway, a 
spokesman for the Forest Service.

<HEADLINE> British Olympic Champion Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Linford Christie, the 100-meter champion at the  
1992 Olympics, was suspended today after his drug test showed the 
possible presence of steroids. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old British sprinter, who now coaches track but  
competes occasionally, insisted he was ``completely innocent'' and 
intends to defend himself against charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Amateur Athletic Federation said Christie  
tested positive for the steroid nandrolone in a urine sample from a 
February meet at Dortmund, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF, the world ruling body for track and field, said  
Christie's sample is not regarded as a positive test. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot conclude the Christie case has been proved,'' IAAF  
spokesman Giorgio Reineri. 
</P>
<P>
	If it is, Christie will receive at least a two-year suspension  
retroactive to the day after the drug test. Reineri said this case 
is unusual because Christie no longer competes seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have consistently opposed the use of banned substances by  
athletes and it is ridiculous to imagine that I would take them 
after my retirement,'' Christie said in a statement released 
through UK Athletics, Britain's governing track organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``I agree that there should be a full investigation into the  
numerous cases where metabolites of nandrolone have been found in 
urine samples to establish how this could happen without the 
knowledge of the athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UK Athletics said it had been notified of Christie's suspension  
by the IAAF. The suspension is in force until an investigation is 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important to note that the imposition of a suspension is  
not a declaration of guilt but rather the result of a decision that 
there is a case to answer,'' UK Athletics said. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension comes a day after sprinter Dennis Mitchell  
received a two-year drug ban. The IAAF said Mitchell's drug test 
showed a high level of testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
	The American runner will be barred from this month's world  
championships in Spain. But because the ban is retroactive Mitchell 
will be eligible for the 2000 Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, UK Athletics cleared European 200-meter champion Doug  
Walker who had tested positive for nandrolone. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker denied he had taken anything intentionally. He was  
initially suspended after the drug showed during an 
out-of-competition test, but UK Athletics lifted the ban after an 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Christie has consistently spoken out against drugs. But he has  
had to fight accusations that his success might be tied to 
performance-enhancing substances. 
</P>
<P>
	At the 1998 Olympics in Seoul, Christie finished third behind  
Ben Johnson and Carl Lewis but wound up with the silver after 
Johnson was stripped of the title for taking steroids. 
</P>
<P>
	Christie survived a scare when a banned substance showed in his  
urine sample, However, the substance derived from ginseng, a health 
drink that was cleared as acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, Christie won $64,000 in libel damages from a  
magazine writer who said his performances were the result of taking 
drugs.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Toni Collette </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When I last spoke to Toni Collette, star of  
``Muriel's Wedding'' and ``Velvet Goldmine,'' she was bubbling with 
enthusiasm about a film she was shooting in Philadelphia with Bruce 
Willis and Haley Joel Osment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's called `The Sixth Sense,' and Haley plays a kid who can  
see ghosts, and he has a psychologist, who is Bruce Willis, and I 
play his mom. It's very beautiful, actually. It's a big Disney 
affair. We're shooting for 8 1/2 weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, nine months later, Collette is on a round of media  
interviews to promote the film, and she is as enthusiastic as ever. 
But she revealed that she almost rejected the script, without 
bothering to read it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd never done a studio film,'' said Collette, sitting on a  
couch at the Disney offices on Park Avenue. ``And I had certain 
preconceived ideas about how formulaic and unoriginal and 
uninspiring that can be, with not much passion involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I was in New York, and I was jet lagged, and it was three  
o'clock in the morning, and I thought, `I'll pick this up and it 
will put me to sleep reading it.' And I just read the entire thing 
and sobbed my guts out, and it made me really want to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collette plays a single parent whose husband has left her. Her  
young son misses his father; she misses her mother, who is dead. 
Their house is empty and their life is joyless. Most of the people 
in her son's life are people no one else can see. 
</P>
<P>
	Willis, a prominent child psychologist, tries to get to the core  
of the child's sadness. Meanwhile, mother and son try to bridge the 
gap of pain and loneliness that separates them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is so emotionally driven, and you feel so connected to the  
characters, or I did at least when I was reading it,'' Collette 
said. ``I didn't realize it was scary until I saw the trailer; I 
thought it was a psycho-spiritual sort of journey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collette, 26, was born in Sydney, Australia. She left school  
when she was 16. She enrolled in drama school at 17 but left ``in 
the second term of the second year'' for work in the theater. 
</P>
<P>
	But Collette doesn't regret her lack of formal training. She has  
worked steadily since ``Muriel's Wedding'' was released in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman she plays in ``The Sixth Sense'' is far removed her  
glam-rocker role in ``Velvet Goldmine.'' She has exchanged 
over-the-top makeup and costumes for a housecoat and bedroom 
slippers. 
</P>
<P>
	Collette heaped praise on Haley, 11, whose previous films  
include ``Forrest Gump.'' His television credits include the role 
of Candice Bergen's son on ``Murphy Brown'' and a guest appearance 
on ``Ally McBeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've worked with kids before, and it was a matter of snatching  
whatever you could while they were up and while they were 
working,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Haley is not a kid. He is, obviously, but he's not, because he  
is analytical, intelligent, he makes decisions like any adult actor 
would, he's very aware of what he's doing, he's very aware of 
himself and therefore aware of his outside world as well. He's a 
brilliant, brilliant actor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During her recent trip to Manhattan, Collette's reddish-gold  
hair was short and spiky. She wore a long, layered dress in shades 
of blue and green, with open-toed shoes revealing her glittery 
painted toenails. 
</P>
<P>
	When she is not working, she goes on retreats in India, climbs  
mountains in Tibet and practices yoga. She doesn't eat meat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to study holistic medicine. Basically I see myself in a  
rain forest with long, white dreadlocks working with herbs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	1. What was it like to work with Bruce Willis?  
</P>
<P>
	Collette: I think people are going to be surprised with Bruce  
because he's really emotionally out there with this film, and it's 
not a part of himself that he usually reveals in his work. 
</P>
<P>
	2. Where do you call home?  
</P>
<P>
	Collette: I live between Sydney, London and the Wicklow  
Mountains in Ireland. ... And then I just kind of live around the 
planet. 
</P>
<P>
	2 1/2. What's with you and Ireland?  
</P>
<P>
	Collette: I love it. I love it. I have Irish ancestry, and I'm  
not saying that's it because obviously everyone does, the Irish get 
around. I went there for the first time about four or five years 
ago. And then I went out with an Irish guy and I just fell in love 
with the land and the people. I've got a lot of friends there, and 
I think the land there has a really beautiful energy. It's 
beautiful and it makes me feel really positive about existing when 
I'm there. 
</P>
<P>
	3. You're a chameleon. You've gone from glam-rock threads in  
``Velvet Goldmine'' to long, painted fingernails and a Philadelphia 
accent in ``The Sixth Sense.'' Can you go around the world more or 
less unrecognized? 
</P>
<P>
	Collette: Except when I smile. When people see my teeth. Then  
all is revealed. (Laughs and smiles, revealing her front teeth, one 
longer than the other.) 
</P>
<P>
	4. How would you describe your character and her relationship  
with her son? 
</P>
<P>
	Collette: She's a single parent, she's working two jobs, she's  
trying to scrape money together to get food on the table, clothe 
him, keep him sheltered, as well as giving all the love and 
nurturing that she can possibly, and she does that. She doesn't 
judge him, even though she knows he's an odd little kid. She fully 
embraces him and would die for him. But she feels like she's 
failing and feels guilty because of this and inadequate. ... And 
it's noticeable that he's sad, there's something odd, it gets worse 
and worse, so the tension builds and they can't communicate 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
	5. Do you practice yoga and go on retreats in India to connect  
with something beyond ...? 
</P>
<P>
	Collette: Well, I think we are connected anyway. It's just a  
matter of being conscious of it. And I just like to go away and 
have time where I have no responsibilities to anybody else. I think 
it's really important to do that. Just to be quiet and just be in a 
nightshirt because I think this is a really unnatural way to live.

<HEADLINE> KGB Documents: Mrs. Kennedy Appealed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just days after President Kennedy was  
assassinated, his wife Jacqueline appealed to Soviet leaders to 
continue peaceful relations with the United States, Soviet 
documents show. 
</P>
<P>
	In conversations with Soviet officials at her husband's funeral  
and in a handwritten note to Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev a week 
after the shooting, Mrs. Kennedy asked the Soviets for 
``continuation of self-control and restraint'' in Cold War 
relations and to pursue peace with the United States, the documents 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	KGB and Soviet diplomatic documents about the Kennedy  
assassination, which Russian President Boris Yeltsin gave to 
President Clinton a few months ago, were described to The 
Associated Press by a senior Clinton administration official 
familiar with them. 
</P>
<P>
	About 80 pages in Russian and their translation will be released  
Thursday by the National Archives and Records Administration, which 
collects, maintains and makes public Kennedy assassination records. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents are just a fraction of the six volumes of Soviet  
records on presidential assassin Lee Harvey Oswald that a federal 
panel had tried, but failed, to obtain in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the now-defunct Assassination Records Review Board  
said that the 80 pages, as described by the White House official, 
were interesting but there are still hundreds of documents -- 
including surveillance records of Oswald and reports from KGB 
operatives in the United States -- that have yet to be turned over. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds like a carefully selected group of records that  
doesn't contain a lot of what is there,'' said John Tunheim, a 
former chairman of the review board who saw some of the documents 
when he was part of a delegation that traveled to Russia in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The volumes of Oswald records stood 4 to 5 feet high, said  
Tunheim. 
</P>
<P>
	The review board was set up locate, gather and eventually make  
public all known assassination records. It went out of business 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. experts who translated and reviewed the documents have  
informed Clinton they shed little light on the November 1963 
assassination of Kennedy, but provide new details about the 
reactions of the Soviets and Kennedy's widow, the administration 
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents show that the Soviets were chagrined by news  
reports linking Oswald to ``leftist'' elements and Soviet agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Oswald, a former Marine, defected to the Soviet Union in 1959  
and renounced his American citizenship. That attracted the 
attention of the KGB, which bugged his apartment in the Belarus 
capital city of Minsk, paid neighbors to inform on him and kept 
Oswald and his Russian wife Marina under constant surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
	Oswald returned to the United States in 1962, settling in Dallas  
with his wife and baby. 
</P>
<P>
	The KGB denounced as ``slander'' American media reports  
suggesting Soviet complicity in Kennedy's death and suggested they 
served only to hide ``who is really behind the assassination,'' the 
official quoted the documents as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Diplomatic memos and notes also show that the Soviets -- media  
reports aside -- were pleased by high-level U.S. contacts 
immediately after the assassination that left them confident the 
shooting in Dallas wouldn't harm their relations with the United 
States, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents indicate that then-Secretary of State Dean Rusk  
quickly engaged in conversations with Soviet diplomats, talking 
about a wide range of issues that included nonproliferation of 
nuclear weapons, possible arms deals and a proposed U.S-Moscow air 
route, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Soviets described the contacts as a sign that it would be  
``business as usual'' with the United States, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes for Patients' Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to exploit Republican defections,  
President Clinton pressed GOP leaders Saturday to allow a House 
vote on legislation guaranteeing protections for managed-care 
patients before lawmakers leave next weekend for the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton noted that some GOP House members, led by lawmakers who  
are also medical doctors, have joined Democrats to urge support for 
a ``patients' bill of rights'' for Americans whose health care 
plans are through health maintenance organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very good news indeed,'' he said in his weekly radio  
address. ``It means there is a bipartisan consensus emerging behind 
a bill that would give all Americans the health protections they 
need. This bill should be debated and voted on this coming week, 
before Congress adjourns for the summer. If that happens, I believe 
the bill would pass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If the House is brave enough to protect the American people  
over the intense lobbying of the health insurance companies, the 
Republican leadership shouldn't stand in their way,'' the president 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	One Republican leader, Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., said health  
care is ``too important to all Americans to act hastily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watts said Republican-led House committees are working on a  
compromise, but ``there are still some key issues to resolve.'' The 
aim, he said, is to craft a bill that holds HMOs accountable and 
enables doctors to pursue the best medical treatment without 
permitting lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the Clinton-Gore administration and the Democrats in  
Congress want is an issue for the 2000 election,'' Watts said. 
``Frankly, it takes longer to write a law than a campaign 
document.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate has passed a bill that is weaker than the legislation  
the Clinton administration proposes and that almost all Capitol 
Hill Democrats support. 
</P>
<P>
	House GOP leaders had planned to bring a similar bill to the  
floor this week, but action was derailed when some GOP House 
members announced support for the Democratic version. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders contend the more sweeping Democratic plans  
would be too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	They advocate a more limited bill to give patients new rights of  
appeal but no right to sue if a health maintenance organization 
denies care or treatment. The GOP legislation also would give 
doctors some new power without removing an HMO's right to determine 
what care is medically necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., said he believes a compromise is  
possible once both chambers pass their versions of 
patient-protection legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we can have a fall dominated by bipartisan consensus  
in Congress if both sides were to put away their mirrors and blow 
away the smoke,'' Chafee said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Hits 499th Homer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire hit his 499th career home run, and  
tied Sammy Sosa for the major league lead with 42 homers this year, 
in the seventh inning Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire hit a 1-0 pitch from San Diego reliever Donne Wall an  
estimated 436 feet, a drive that cleared the left-field bullpen. 
The homer lifted the St. Louis Cardinals into a 6-all tie with the 
Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Sosa homered for the Cubs against Montreal.  
</P>
<P>
	McGwire and Sosa have homered on the same day 35 times the last  
two seasons, including 15 times this year. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire leads the NL with 99 RBIs, including 11 in the last six

<HEADLINE> Kellogg Co. To Introduce New Cereal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Coming soon to a breakfast bowl near you: a cereal that promises  
to deliver a super-dose of calcium. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg Co. was to introduce Wednesday its Special K Plus, a  
multi-grain, fruited cereal that, without milk, provides 600 
milligrams of calcium with every one-cup serving. 
</P>
<P>
	That's 60 percent of the daily calcium recommended by the  
federal government and many public health groups. The 
recommendations are higher for adolescents and people over age 50. 
</P>
<P>
	``It contains two times the calcium of any national cereal,''  
said Kellogg spokeswoman Meghan Parkhurst. ``With milk, the calcium 
goes up to 75 percent'' or 750 milligrams. 
</P>
<P>
	The cereal, the latest in an arsenal of products designed to  
revive the Battle Creek, Mich., manufacturer's stale cereal sales, 
will be sold in a milk carton to emphasize the high calcium 
content. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg Co.'s second-quarter earnings, released July 29, jumped  
7.7 percent, but the company's first-quarter earnings were down 30 
percent after a disappointing 1998. While overall sales were up 4 
percent to $1.8 billion for the quarter, cereal sales were 
relatively flat. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg hopes the new cereal will appeal to the three out of  
four Americans who are thought to not get enough calcium -- 
particularly women concerned about preventing osteoporosis, a 
degenerative bone disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacquelynn O'Palka, a clinical professor at the Indiana  
University School of Allied Health Sciences said it's difficult for 
the body to absorb calcium in large doses and that she prefers milk 
and other dairy products as sources for calcium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not ideal,'' she said ``But you think about the day and  
how rushed people are. This may their only shot at getting 
calcium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Special K Plus will cost the same as regular Special K and  
should be on store shelves by month's end.

<HEADLINE> Reno Subpoenaed for Alien Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House subcommittee voted Wednesday to  
subpoena Attorney General Janet Reno for information on immigrants 
with criminal records who go on to commit more offenses after being 
released from custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans angry over the Immigration and Naturalization  
Service's release of a Mexican drifter suspected in nine killings 
voted 6-1 to issue a subpoena after Rep. Lamar Smith said he never 
received data he requested from Reno in mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
	``The attorney general failed to respond in a timely or  
responsive manner,'' Smith, R-Texas, said. ``There is no excuse for 
withholding crucial information from Congress and the American 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's immigration  
subcommittee, said he was not satisfied by a two-page letter the 
Justice Department sent in response to his request. 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter Monday, Acting Assistant Attorney General Jon P.  
Jennings said a total of 26,870 criminal immigrants had been 
released from custody for various reasons in the five-year period 
ending May 31. But the department had no information on those who 
committed additional crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, many of the aliens who commit crimes are encountered  
by the INS following their release and are dealt with appropriately 
as a result of referrals received from state and local law 
enforcement channels,'' Jennings' letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he didn't believe that no other information was  
available. 
</P>
<P>
	The subpoena gives Reno three weeks to turn over ``all records  
relating to inadmissible or deportable criminal aliens who, during 
the past five years, were released from Immigration and 
Naturalization Service detention and subsequently convicted of 
additional crimes committed in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The subpoena was signed by House Judiciary Committee Chairman  
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., later in the day, Smith spokesman Alan Kay 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS recently came under fire for allowing Angel Maturino  
Resendez, suspected to be the ``railroad killer,'' to slip 
repeatedly through its fingers. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans have bitterly complained about the INS for  
years, accusing it of fiscal mismanagement, allowing the Southwest 
border of the United States to become a ``sieve'' where illegal 
immigrants cross at will, and of bungling the citizenship process, 
forcing applicants to wait for years to be sworn in as Americans.

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame Booster To Be Freed Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Kimberly Dunbar, the woman who embezzled  
more than $1.2 million from her employer and spent some of the 
money on Notre Dame football players, will be released from prison 
in October, a year earlier than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Her attorney, William Stanley, said Dunbar's release was moved  
up to Oct. 17 because she earned an associate's degree from Indiana 
while in prison, qualifying for a new state law that rewards 
inmates for earning educational degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Last September, Dunbar pleaded guilty to two Class C felony  
theft charges for embezzling the money. She was sentenced to four 
years in prison, meaning she would be eligible for release after 
two years with good behavior. She was also ordered to serve 
probation until 2014. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunbar admitted to spending much of the money on up to a dozen  
current and former Notre Dame players, leading to an investigation 
into the program. 
</P>
<P>
	The school appeared before the NCAA Committee on Infractions in  
June and is still awaiting word on what penalties it may face 
because of Dunbar's interaction with players. The NCAA ruled she 
was a school booster through her association with the now-defunct 
Quarterback Club.

<HEADLINE> Widow Will Run for Husband's Seat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Rep. George E. Brown Jr.'s widow  
announced today she will run for his seat in Congress, setting the 
stage for a tough race among Democrats in California's 42nd 
District. 
</P>
<P>
	``My husband, Congressman Brown, was taken from us too soon,''  
Marta Macias Brown, 54, said before entering the county registrar 
of voters office in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had so much work in progress,'' she said. ``Who better to  
replace him than the person who worked side by side with him over 
the last 19 years? I will strive to carry out the Brown legacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sept. 21 primary election and likely November runoff is for  
the seat representing residents of San Bernardino and other towns 
lying east of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The congressman died July 15. He was 79 -- the oldest member of  
the House -- and in his 18th term. 
</P>
<P>
	The election will be closely watched as a bellwether one year  
before the 2000 congressional races, when Democrats will try to 
break the GOP's slim hold on the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Her entry into the race will pit two Hispanic Democrats -- her  
and state Sen. Joe Baca, her main competitor -- against each other 
in a district where the Hispanic voters are 27 percent of the 
electorate and growing. Another Democrat, real estate agent Donald 
Hubner, also plans to run. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown was the third California congressman to die in office  
since October 1997. The other two widows -- Republican Mary Bono, 
widow of entertainer turned congressman Sonny Bono, and Democrat 
Lois Capps, widow of Rep. Walter Capps -- captured their late 
husbands' seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Brown said Mrs. Bono called her after Brown's death,  
offering moral support as a fellow widow and advising her to not 
make a decision on whether to run until she was certain that was 
what she wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``Running against a widow is always very difficult, because  
there's a sympathy factor,'' said Mike Madrid, political director 
for the state GOP last year when the party tried to beat Lois 
Capps. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Brown's candidacy further splinters the Democratic vote and  
virtually eliminates the possibility anyone will win the seat 
outright in the primary by garnering a majority of all votes cast. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the three Democrats, Republicans likely to run are  
attorney and real estate businessman Elia Pirozzi, who lost to 
Brown last year; Linda Wilde, a Superior Court judge who lost to 
Brown in 1996; and businessman John Corry. 
</P>
<P>
	If no one gets a majority of all votes cast Sept. 21, the top  
Democrat and the top Republican vote-getters will advance to the 
runoff.

<HEADLINE> Musical Estate of Bach's Son Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A trove of music written by Johann Sebastian Bach  
and his children has been discovered in Ukraine, more than 50 years 
after it was lost in the chaos of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The music, part of the missing archives of the Berlin  
Sing-Akademie, a still-performing group established in 1791, was 
found in Kiev after a 20-year search by a Harvard music professor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was believed lost. There was absolutely no trace of it for  
well over 50 years,'' Christoph Wolff, who is also dean of the 
Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, said Wednesday. ``For a long 
time, we Bach scholars were led to believe that the material was 
destroyed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolff said the Germans took the Sing-Akademie archive from  
Berlin in 1943 to protect it from the destruction of war. When 
hostilities ended in 1945, it fell into Soviet hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolff had spent the past two decades tracking various leads, but  
his real break came in April when another Harvard researcher found 
a Russian document from the post-war years ``that described the 
existence of 5,000-plus music manuscripts in Kiev.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until June that Wolff located the archive, cut through  
significant red tape and spent three days rooting through the old 
papers at Ukraine's Central State Archive. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really adding a significant new dimension to the study  
of 18th-century music,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The compositions were found among the 5,000 or so documents in  
the Sing-Akademie archives as part of the musical estate of Carl 
Phillipp Emanuel Bach, one of J.S. Bach's sons, himself a 
well-known composer. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the most exciting aspect of this whole discovery,''  
Wolff said. ``C.P.E. Bach was one of the most significant composers 
in the mid-18th century after the death of his father.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The archive also holds works by some of J.S. Bach's 19 other  
children, as well as a variety of other 18th- and early 
19th-century German composers. It also has letters written by poet 
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolff said he hopes the works may someday be returned to  
Germany, but no decisions have been made about the documents' 
future.

<HEADLINE> Liberians in US Lose Special Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Torli Krua was hunted down in the middle of the  
night by machete-wielding warlords in Liberia nearly 10 years ago, 
but he managed to escape from the marauders targeting him because 
he was from a rival tribe. 
</P>
<P>
	He may soon be forced to return to his country.  
</P>
<P>
	After war erupted in the West African nation of Liberia in 1989,  
Liberians were granted temporary permission to live and work in the 
United States until their homeland settled down. 
</P>
<P>
	The special immigration status was extended year after year, and  
many Liberians were able to begin new lives here. But the State 
Department now says Liberia is stable and has recommended that the 
1,000 to 1,500 Liberians granted the special status return home by 
Sept. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Krua and others are pleading for permission to remain, saying  
Liberia is still too dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (Liberian) government has not shown it will tolerate  
dissent,'' said Krua, 48, who has been living in Boston. ``Here, I 
go to bed freely. I speak freely. If I go back, I don't know if I 
will be able to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department and the State Department say that while  
Liberia continues to struggle from the effects of the civil war, 
Liberians here should be safe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Temporary Protected Status allows foreigners to stay in the  
United States if their home countries suffer political violence or 
natural disasters. Liberians whose temporary protected status 
expires have the right to apply for political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberia's civil war ravaged the country between 1989 and 1996,  
leaving an estimated 200,000 people dead. While the country is 
largely at peace, much of it is still without electricity, passable 
roads, and supplies remain short. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberia's political system is riddled by tribal division. A  
person's tribe often makes or breaks their position in society. 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics of Liberia's president, Charles Taylor, say the  
former warlord has rewarded supporters and punishes those who are 
not obedient. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who had homes, property and skills fled because they  
had to,'' said Rev. Henry James, a Liberian who lives permanently 
in Stoughton. ``If some of these Liberians go back, they will be 
hunted because of who they are and their tribal backgrounds.''

<HEADLINE> Reno Subpoenaed for Alien Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Angry about the release of a Mexican drifter  
suspected in nine killings, a House subcommittee has voted to 
subpoena the nation's top law enforcement officer to get 
information on immigrants with criminal records who commit more 
crimes after they're freed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Immigration and Naturalization Service recently came under  
fire for allowing Angel Maturino Resendez, the suspected ``railroad

connection with murders in Texas, Illinois and Kentucky.

<HEADLINE> Parents Arrested in Prayer Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Authorities have brought murder charges against  
the parents of an 8-year-old girl whose beaten body was found in 
her family's Buddhist prayer room near a note written in blood 
praying for ``compassion, love and kindness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tung Tuong, 42, and Minh Tuong, 30, were arrested Tuesday on  
murder and child abuse charges in the death of Christine Tuong. 
They each were being held on $1 million bond. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple has been under investigation since the girl's bruised  
body was discovered May 15. Her parents waited nearly 14 hours to 
report her death. 
</P>
<P>
	A preliminary autopsy report said the girl was hit with a belt  
more than 17 times, leaving injuries that match belt buckles found 
in the family's home. ``The injuries were so severe that Christine 
was not even able to speak or walk under her own power,'' the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple told police the girl came home the night she died  
with bruises after playing in a vacant lot near their home. They 
said they tried to heal her with a Buddhist ritual that involved 
prayer and oils that were rubbed on her body. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tuongs' four other young children, including a boy born in  
June, are in the custody of the state's Child Protective Services 
agency. Police said the family had been investigated at least four 
times since 1995 after school nurses reported seeing bruises for 
which the explanations seemed far-fetched.

<HEADLINE> Immigrant Plan Enforcement Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Sponsors of a voter-approved ban on  
education and public services for illegal immigrants on Wednesday 
asked a federal appeals court to allow enforcement of the 
initiative because Gov. Gray Davis failed to defend it. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis announced last week that he had settled a lawsuit by  
immigrants'-rights groups by agreeing to drop the state's appeal of 
a federal judge's ruling that declared most of Proposition 187 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the governor abandoned the defense of Proposition 187,  
the will of the people was frustrated,'' the Pacific Legal 
Foundation, a pro-187 group, said in papers filed with the 9th U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	In a final legal attempt to revive the 1994 ballot measure, the  
foundation argued that there is no longer any legal ``controversy'' 
between the state and opponents of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Constitution allows federal courts to hear only  
cases involving controversies between opposing parties, the judge's 
ruling should be withdrawn and the suit dismissed, the foundation 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The request, if granted, would require opponents to file a new  
suit and give supporters of the initiative a chance to defend it in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-187 groups stayed out of the previous case, deferring to  
then-Gov. Pete Wilson and then-Attorney General Dan Lungren, and 
were turned down when they sought later to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposition 187, approved by 59 percent of the voters, would  
deny public education, social services and non-emergency health 
care to illegal immigrants, who were already ineligible for most 
health and welfare benefits under federal law.

<HEADLINE> Students Wear Patches for Columbine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Colorado high school students, from athletes to  
musicians, will begin wearing tiny, black-and-white patches this 
fall that bear a single word: Respect. 
</P>
<P>
	The patch is designed to promote harmony among the typical  
school cliques whose divisions were exposed so painfully in the 
Columbine High School shooting that left 15 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt compelled to come up with a way to still have a link  
with that tragedy but move forward,'' said Bill Reader, associate 
commissioner of the Colorado High School Activities Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Dylan Klebold, 17, and Eric Harris, 18, killed 12 students, a  
teacher and themselves in an April 20 rampage through their school. 
Twenty-three students were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were members of the Trench Coat Mafia, a group of  
students who shared a predilection for dark ``Goth'' culture and 
according to diary entries, they considered themselves outcasts in 
the school pecking order. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses have said the young gunmen singled out those who  
infuriated them the most -- popular athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Junior Aaron Cohn, 16, who was in the school library when the  
killers walked in and shot several people, believes he survived 
because a classmate jumped on his back and covered the baseball 
slogan on his shirt. He said he would probably wear one of the 
patches on his baseball uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means people trying to unite with the whole,'' he said.

	The Colorado High School Activities Association, the high school  
governing body in the state, plans to send schools more than 
200,000 of the one-inch-by-two inch patches later this month, to be 
worn voluntarily by students at sports, music, speech and student 
council activities. The patches, white with black lettering, will 
be free. 
</P>
<P>
	Association staffers came up with the idea of the patch after  
sports officials asked them to develop a way to honor Columbine and 
the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Beck, whose stepdaughter Lauren Townsend was killed in the  
shooting, works for the manufacturer of the patches, Denver 
Athletic Supply. He would like to take the idea of respect to 
another level by painting the word on the wall of every school gym 
in the state so the message would reach more students. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will let kids understand there are other ways to deal with  
problems besides violence,'' Beck said.

<HEADLINE> White House Cites Y2K Weak Spots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House worries that local  
governments, small hospitals, school districts and small businesses 
are not doing enough to prepare for any Year 2000 technology 
problems, according to an administration report. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, the nation's banks, utilities, travel industry and  
the federal government will be ready to confront potential computer 
troubles in the new year, said the report being released today by 
the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion. 
</P>
<P>
	With fewer than 150 days left before Jan. 1, 2000, the latest  
snapshot of America's readiness said ``more and more organizations 
are reporting that they have met the Y2K challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States is in a much better position to make the  
transition into the Year 2000 than was the case just a few short 
months ago,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of greatest concern to the administration is inadequate  
preparation by small businesses and hospitals, local governments 
and school districts -- organizations taking a ``wait-and-see'' 
approach to computer failures after the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	The council urged the nation to shift its focus to areas where  
the highest chance for failures exist and to make sure that 
organizations have contingency plans for unexpected failures. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, which called Y2K preparations ``one of the most  
extraordinary management challenges of our time,'' said 25 percent 
of counties have no formal plans, and only a little more than 
one-third the nation's 911 emergency call centers were compliant in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been concern about the slow progress in the area of  
remediating 911 dispatch systems, especially in municipalities with 
large populations that often operate complex systems,'' the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spring survey of health care providers found only 40 percent  
were prepared, while 15 percent have not done anything to get 
ready. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 28 percent of more than 3,500 school systems reported they  
were ready, and the same percentage of small businesses admitted in 
a recent survey they plan to take no preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	But the report predicted no problems with the nation's grocery  
stores, banks, electrical and water utilities and phone companies -- 
except for international calls -- and said consumer appliances 
probably would not be affected, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``Older model VCRs may have programming problems but will still  
play and record off the air,'' the report said. ``Fax machines and 
camcorders will operate but may show incorrect information in date 
headers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House was less optimistic about problems overseas. It  
noted that while foreign preparations have improved, there still is 
a general lack of information about industries in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is likely some countries will not escape Y2K-related  
disruptions in key infrastructure systems,'' the report said, 
finding that ``efforts to prepare electric power systems are of 
particular concern.''

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Davis an `Invisible Man' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Terrell Davis has one of the most  
recognizable faces in the United States, so it's no wonder he feels 
like the invisible man Down Under. 
</P>
<P>
	While the 16-hour flight from Denver to Sydney, Australia, upset  
some of the Broncos' players, there has been an upside for 
superstars like Davis, last season's NFL MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one really knows who I am, so that's kind of cool to walk  
around and be a normal person,'' Davis said after Broncos practiced 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis has to endure a bewildering level of fame in his hometown.  
He spoke Wednesday of being approached by fans wanting to talk 
football midway through a show at a movie theater. 
</P>
<P>
	A random poll of 20 downtown office workers Monday came up with  
20 blanks on Davis' name. In a walk around the same downtown area 
Tuesday night, Davis said he had just one person, a bartender, say 
he recognized him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so different from what I'm used to, living my life at  
home,'' Davis said. ``You get used to it and try to adjust and do 
things to make it easier. You know when to go out and when not to 
go out. How to handle different situations, and as you get older 
and more experienced, it gets a little bit easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis is smart enough to know that his massive salary is  
directly linked to his fame. So he's not about to dump on Denver's 
loyal fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't dislike fame, but sometimes you're just not in the  
mood to deal with fans,'' Davis said. ``I love the fans but you 
know fans are harsh sometimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season Davis became just the fourth player in NFL history  
to rush for 2,000 yards in a single season. This year he must 
adjust to life after John Elway, the legendary quarterback who 
retired after back-to-back Super Bowl victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis says he has every confidence that Bubby Brister's  
elevation to the starting quarterback position will provide a 
smooth transition for the Broncos' offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're running the same system we ran last year and  
we're trying to do things the same way, so we don't change too much 
from last year,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worked with Bubby last year when he started four games so  
I'm comfortable with him. I'm glad I had the opportunity to play 
with him last year because it kind of gave me a preview to this 
season. I think we're going to work well together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Broncos regular-season finale against Seattle last year,  
Davis, suffering sore ribs and finding it hard to breathe, needed 
170 yards to reach the 2000. With coach Mike Shanahan's help, and 
with his usual focus and toughness, Davis rushed for 178. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I'm concerned about is the team goals, and if I  
achieve that then I've succeeded,'' Davis insists. ``It's nothing 
about Terrell and his personal goals. Maybe this team won't be the 
running team it was the last couple of seasons, I don't know that, 
but hopefully we'll have the same type of success we've been 
having.''

<HEADLINE> Watts Threatened To Resign As Chair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A turf battle that erupted on Capitol Hill  
among senior Republican leaders prompted GOP Conference Chairman 
J.C. Watts of Oklahoma to threaten to resign his post. 
</P>
<P>
	The source of Watts' ire, according to his allies, was Rep. Tom  
DeLay of Texas, the powerful GOP whip charged with marshaling votes 
for Republican legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials close to both men said Watts took offense when DeLay  
handed out a communications strategy and questionnaire last 
Thursday during a meeting of House Republicans -- a job 
traditionally handled by someone wearing Watts' leadership hat. 
</P>
<P>
	After the meeting, Watts, the first black man in a top GOP  
leadership post since the party won congressional control five 
years ago, confronted House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and 
threatened to resign as conference chairman, according to 
leadership officials familiar with the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert stepped in to stop the squabble, they said.  
</P>
<P>
	``J.C. was not pleased on Thursday,'' said Rep. Pete Hoekstra,  
R-Mich. ``His view was that if J.C. Watts and Tom DeLay are not 
working together, neither of them will be successful at their 
leadership jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watts, who has expressed frustration before about being usurped  
by other GOP leaders, issued a statement calling the brouhaha a 
``family'' matter. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay insists he was only trying to help.  
</P>
<P>
	``Had we foreseen this (action) would have caused this much  
tension, we would have never done it in the first place,'' said 
DeLay spokesman Mike Scanlon. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials close to DeLay said the communications strategy was  
only a response to Watts' own call for more coordination during a 
meeting the two men had two days earlier at Watts' request. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers close to DeLay say one of his aides called Watts'  
office the night before DeLay was to present his communications 
strategy to House Republicans. They say the aide left a message, 
asking Watts' office to call back if there was any problem with 
presenting the plan, but no one did. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials close to Watts said his office responded by asking for  
a copy of the strategy before it was presented, but never received 
it. DeLay's camp said it never received such a request.

<HEADLINE> Senators Seek Farm Aid Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eager to placate farmers hurt by drought and  
depressed crop prices, senators struggled today to work out a 
compromise between Republican and Democratic aid plans that are 
billions apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers are telling their senators: ``They want action, they  
want votes, some indication that something will happen,'' said 
Idaho Sen. Larry Craig, one of several Republicans negotiating with 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats united with fiscally conservative Republicans today to  
reject a $7.5 billion proposal offered by farm-state GOP senators. 
On Tuesday, the Senate defeated an $11 billion Democratic plan. 
With losses mounting from an East Coast drought, the GOP proposal 
wouldn't go far enough, Democrats said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still hopeful we can reach a decent compromise,'' said  
Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The money would be added to an annual spending bill for the  
Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The House has yet to consider farm aid, although Speaker Dennis  
Hastert has said he's committed to passing something. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately today, the Senate voted to require the president to  
get approval from Congress before including food or medicine in a 
trade embargo. The measure is aimed at increasing exports of farm 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	``Food embargoes typically have no effect on the actions of  
foreign leaders, serving only to damage American agriculture while 
denying much-needed food and medicine to innocent people with whom 
we have no quarrel,'' said Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	A worldwide glut of grain has depressed commodity prices for the  
second year in a row, and Agriculture Department estimates that net 
farm income will dip to $43.8 billion this year, about 4 percent 
below the inflation-adjusted average for the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, drought has parched crops from New York to Virginia.  
Although the drought isn't likely to push commodity prices up, it 
has galvanized support for farm assistance among East Coast 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen this before and it shouldn't surprise us. Whenever  
commodity prices fall and there's a certain amount of dislocation 
among some producers, then there's going to be a political 
response,'' said Kevin Kliesen, an economist with the Federal 
Reserve Bank of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers themselves have mixed opinions about what Congress  
should do. 
</P>
<P>
	While there's widespread support for some kind of assistance,  
there's disagreement about the best way to deliver the aid or how 
much growers need. And there is concern that some growers will use 
the cash to bid up farm rents to expand their operations. 
</P>
<P>
	And some farmers ``don't want any payment at all for fear of  
what it may do. Others need it right now,'' said Edward 
Wiederstein, a grain and hog producer who is president of the Iowa 
Farm Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, some Republicans are worried that they're getting  
into a bidding war with Democrats. During last fall's congressional 
campaigns, Republicans proposed $4 billion in farm aid only to have 
the president veto the package and force them to add $2 billion 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're competing to show compassion with other people's  
money,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Up on Weather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures advanced strongly a  
third day Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid expectations 
recent hot, dry weather will reduce expected bumper harvests. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices have rallied sharply in the past week on the  
unexpected turn in fortunes for a crop that many originally thought 
would exceed all estimates for production. 
</P>
<P>
	Hot, dry weather has taken its toll on crops in Illinois, one of  
the two largest growing states, and eastward. 
</P>
<P>
	While corn and soybean harvests likely will remain quite large,  
the reductions could come at a fortuitous time. Demand to Asia, a 
key exporting region for U.S. producers, is on the rise as 
countries there shake off economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 5 cents to $3.06 1/4 a bushel;  
December corn rose 5 3/4 cents to $2.36 1/2 a bushel; December oats rose 
1 1/4 cents to $1.18 1/4 a bushel; November soybeans rose 15 3/4 cents to 
$4.94 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle and lean hog futures were mixed on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, while feeder cattle and pork bellies 
retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle rose .08 cent to 64.35 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .25 cent to 76.07 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs rose .75 cent to 50.45 cents a pound; August pork bellies fell 
2.90 cents to 56.72 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Proof Found of Early Organisms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The earliest direct evidence of organisms pumping oxygen into  
Earth's ancient atmosphere has been found in the fossilized 
remnants of bacterial slime, according to research that also gives 
scientists a new tool in the hunt for life on Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2 1/2 billion-year-old molecular fossils from Australia show  
that early forms of life began paving the evolutionary path for 
oxygen-breathing animals at least 700 million years earlier than 
previously known, researchers said in Thursday's journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life wouldn't be what it is today if we didn't have oxygen in  
the atmosphere and in the ocean,'' said Roger Summons, the study's 
lead author and chief research scientist for the Australian 
Geological Survey Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists had long suspected that organisms called  
cyanobacteria first started converting sunlight and carbon dioxide 
into food energy and oxygen billions of years ago. But no evidence 
had been previously found in fossils. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Summons and his colleagues tested samples from a drill core  
in Western Australia's Hammersley Basin, one of the most 
geologically stable areas on Earth, and later, samples from Mexico, 
Germany and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	They discovered a durable molecular signature -- ``fingerprints''  
- unique to certain cyanobacteria that lived on the shores of the 
ancient oceans, long before plants, animals and other complex life 
emerged. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first good evidence of early oxygenic  
photosynthesis,'' Jere Lipps, professor of biology at the 
University of California, Berkeley, said. ``That's important 
because we couldn't be certain based on microfossils or other 
geologic evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The technique of identifying the molecular signature of ancient  
organisms also could be used in the hunt for life elsewhere in the 
universe. 
</P>
<P>
	David McKay, a NASA researcher who led a 1996 team that  
announced a meteorite from Mars showed evidence of ancient life, 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really potentially useful,'' he said Wednesday. ``We  
think that this is the first of a number of molecular biomarkers 
that may be documented in the future and that can be applied 
directly to returned Mars samples.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The markers discovered by Summons' team survived the ravages of  
2 1/2 billion years on Earth. Mars, a quieter place geologically, 
could preserve the record even longer, McKay said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forms of cyanobacteria exist today, often referred to as  
blue-green algae because they resemble the slimy substance. They 
can be found in places like the hot springs of Yellowstone National 
Park.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Browns Player Faces Drug Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A former Cleveland Browns player, the son of a  
former Cleveland Indians pitcher and a teacher have been charged 
with being part of a drug trafficking conspiracy, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agents on Tuesday arrested Michael St. Clair, 45, a  
former defensive end for the Browns and the Cincinnati Bengals, and 
Michael Ward, 41, who teaches at Clark Middle School in East 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	An arrest warrant also was issued for James T. Grant, 36, son of  
former Indians pitcher Jim ``Mudcat'' Grant. Grant was still at 
large on Wednesday, FBI spokesman Robert hawk said. 
</P>
<P>
	They and four other men were accused of involvement in the drug  
trafficking conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	An alleged drug dealer, Jack Henderson Jr., of Cleveland, told  
agents that he bought one kilogram of cocaine from Grant, according 
to FBI affidavits. The affidavits also said Ward and St. Clair 
tried to buy cocaine from Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant's father pitched for the Indians from 1958 to 1964 and  
with several other major league teams until 1971. St. Clair played 
for the Browns from 1976 to 1979 and for the Bengals from 1980 to 
1982.

<HEADLINE> Mozart Won't Make Kids Smarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Playing classical music for your baby might  
produce a more cultured toddler, but a smarter one? Not 
necessarily. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers are debunking a popularly theory that listening to  
the music of 18th century composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart spurs 
brain development in children under 3 years of age. 
</P>
<P>
	The theory was widely publicized after 1993 and 1995 studies  
conducted on college students at the University of 
California-Irvine showed an increase in spatial-reasoning 
immediately after exposure to a Mozart piano sonata. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kenneth Steele, a psychology professor at Appalachian State  
University in Boone, N.C., and John Bruer, who heads the McDonnell 
Foundation in St. Louis, say there's no real benefit, and that one 
would see the same results listening to any kind of music or none 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have tried to produce the effect all kinds of ways,''  
Steele said. ``Not only haven't we found that it is a weak effect 
and we can't make it stronger, we can't find any kind of effect at 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the University of California studies were released, some  
parents began playing Mozart compositions in their homes in hopes 
of raising smarter children. It wasn't just parents who were swayed 
by the study. 
</P>
<P>
	In Georgia, former Gov. Zell Miller started a program to provide  
every young mother with a CD of the composer's music. And the 
National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences Foundation handed 
out free CDs of Grammy-winning classical music at hundreds of 
hospitals in May. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's how science spreads through our culture,'' said Steele.  
``There is one kind of study and everyone assumes that it's true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Follow-up studies have been unable to duplicate the original  
research, he said. Steele conducted a study that went so far as to 
follow the same procedures used to produce the effect in the 
original study. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we went back to that and still didn't get the effect,  
that cast grave doubts on the original effect and what the effect 
means,'' Steele said. ``It can't be investigated. It can't be 
researched.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steele's research is published in the July issue of the journal  
Psychological Science; Bruer's book, ``The Myth of the First Three 
Years,'' will be published next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele's test subjects showed an increase in reasoning when  
listening to contemporary composer Philip Glass -- or not listening 
to anything at all. The differences between silence, Mozart and 
Glass's music were so small, Steele said, they lacked any 
statistical significance. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all scientists feel there is no value in ``extra''  
stimulation for young children. 
</P>
<P>
	John Flohr, a professor of music education at Texas' Woman's  
University in Denton, Texas, was a consultant on the project to 
hand out Grammy-winning music to new parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stimulus in the environment has a significant effect in early  
childhood,'' Flohr said. ``We don't know what will do what yet. But 
music could be a part of that.''

<HEADLINE> Suns Close In On Hardaway Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Phoenix Suns are closing in on a deal to  
acquire bring Penny Hardaway from the Orlando Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's told us he wants to be here. We've finalized the  
contract, and now we're waiting for Orlando to pull the trigger,'' 
Suns president Jerry Colangelo said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns would reportedly send Pat Garrity, Danny Manning and  
two draft picks to Orlando in exchange for the four-time All-Star 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns intensified their efforts to land Hardaway just as  
other NBA teams, including the Los Angeles Lakers and Toronto 
Raptors, backed off. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida media outlets quoted Magic general manager John Gabriel  
as saying the Suns' deal is ``the only trade left out there.'' The 
remaining option for Orlando would be to try to convince Hardaway 
to stay with the Magic to play for new coach Doc Rivers. The 
Arizona Republic said Rivers was making a last-ditch effort to 
pursuade Hardaway to stay in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway was in Phoenix last Friday and Saturday, met with team  
officials, and played golf with coach Danny Ainge. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix radio station KMGE reported Tuesday night that the deal  
was completed. But Colangelo told The Associated Press nothing was 
final. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be premature to say anything about a deal that's  
done,'' he said late Tuesday night. ``We've had a lot of 
conversation with his agent and with Orlando, but I can't confirm 
to you that a deal is done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic want a sign-and-trade deal, even one that might not  
bring the kind of value they think Hardaway is worth, in order to 
get some compensation for their star guard. 
</P>
<P>
	A sign-and-trade deal is the only way the Suns could get  
Hardaway, because they have no room under the salary cap to sign 
him outright as a free agent, a situation similar to most other 
teams in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old guard has averaged 19 points in his six NBA  
seasons, but dropped to 15.8 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando is in the midst of a roster overhaul under new coach Doc  
Rivers. The Magic traded Nick Anderson to Sacramento on Tuesday for 
Tariq Abdul-Wahad and a first-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	According to The Tribune of Mesa, while Hardaway was in Phoenix,  
Colangelo presented him with a set of golf clubs in a purple golf 
bag with Hardaway's name and the Phoenix Suns' logo stitched into 
it. It's the kind of gesture Colangelo is known for in his 
successful attempts to attract athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers removed themselves from the Hardaway sweepstakes when  
they reached a seven-year, $30 million agreement with Derek Fisher.

	Clinton Promises To Veto Tax Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today promised to veto the  
$792 billion Republican tax cut plan, calling it ``risky and 
plainly wrong for America.'' The GOP plan would gradually cut 1 
percentage point off each personal income tax rate. It also would 
provide relief from the so-called marriage penalty, cut the 
individual capital-gains tax rate and eventually eliminate the 
estate tax. Clinton said the package ``signs away our commitment to 
America's future, Social Security, Medicare, paying down the 
debt.''

	Boy Scouts To Appeal Gays' Ruling  
</P>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The Boy Scouts of America says it will  
appeal today's ruling by the New Jersey Supreme Court that said the 
group's ban on homosexuals is illegal. The court unanimously 
decided in favor of a James Dale, an assistant scoutmaster who was 
kicked out nine years ago when Boy Scout leaders found out he is 
gay. The court said the Boy Scouts organization constitutes a 
``place of public accommodation'' because it has a broad-based 
membership. Thus, the court said, under the anti-discrimination 
law, the Boy Scouts cannot deny any person ``accommodations, 
advantages, facilities and privileges'' because of sexual 
orientation.

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The top U.N. administrator in Kosovo  
toured a mass grave today where the remains of dozens of ethnic 
Albanians were found. The 72 graves were uncovered in and around an 
existing graveyard on a hill overlooking the northern village of 
Kosovska Mitrovica. Officials said they had so far retrieved 40 to 
50 bodies over the past 10 days. Some of the remains were in body 
bags and appeared to have been brought to the site over a period 
from April to June, when Serb forces were waging a campaign of 
expulsions and massacres in Kosovo, a spokesman for the 
international war crimes tribunal said. He also said some of the 
bodies had signs of torture.

	Survey: Age Doesn't Deter Sex Drive

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new survey finds that many Americans  
continue to have active sex lives and find their partners 
attractive as they age -- although as health declines and partners 
are lost to death or divorce, sex becomes less frequent for most. 
The survey was conducted by the AARP, the nation's largest 
organization of older adults, for the September-October issue of 
its ``Modern Maturity'' magazine. The survey found that more than 
six in 10 men between the ages of 45 and 59 and a similar 
percentage of women in middle age report having sex at least once a 
week.

lethal, inexpensive, easy to care for and easy to hide, a U.N.

grenade-launchers are increasingly ``the weapon of choice'' in 
contemporary conflicts, the U.N. Department for Disarmament said in

<HEADLINE> British Olympic Champion Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Linford Christie, the retired former Olympic  
sprint champion who has repeatedly denied taking drugs and claims 
he now competes for fun, is furious that he's being forced to stop 
racing because of a drug test. 
</P>
<P>
	After a decade at the top, he's been banned on suspicion of  
steroid use. 
</P>
<P>
	The glittering career of the 1992 Olympic titlist who reveled in  
beating the American stars could be overshadowed by a test at an 
indoor meet at Dortmund, Germany, in February. The test showed 
traces of the banned steroid nandrolone. 
</P>
<P>
	Christie only ran in the meet because of challenges thrown down  
by the sprinters he was coaching. He won a heat and then finished 
fourth in the final. 
</P>
<P>
	But a urine test gave an adverse reading for metabolites of  
nandrolone, and if the test eventually proves positive, Christie 
could be banned for two years, even though he has retired. 
</P>
<P>
	``I vigorously deny ever taking any form of banned substance.  
What would be the point of me doing it?'' Christie said on 
Wednesday after news of the ban came from UK Athletics and the 
world governing body, the International Amateur Athletic 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old British athlete, who now coaches leading  
sprinters in Europe, also gave his support to a campaign for a more 
reliable testing procedure for nandrolone, which can be produced 
naturally. 
</P>
<P>
	``I agree that there should be a full investigation into the  
numerous cases where metabolites of nandrolone have been found in 
urine samples to establish how this could happen without the 
knowledge of the athletes,'' Christie said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF says the suspension is technical and that the test  
isn't positive. But the athlete who has often spoken out against 
the use of performance enhancing substances faces a two-year ban if 
he's proved wrong this time, and his 23-title career would be in 
ruins. 
</P>
<P>
	``The unfortunate thing is that this puts a cloud over  
everything Linford has done, whether he is innocent or guilty,'' 
said Derek Redmond, a former 400-meter runner who was one of 
Christie's teammates at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Christie has consistently spoken out against drugs. But he has  
had to fight accusations that his success might be tied to 
performance-enhancing substances. 
</P>
<P>
	At the 1998 Seoul Olympics, Christie finished third behind Ben  
Johnson and Carl Lewis, but wound up with the silver after Johnson 
was stripped of the title for taking steroids. 
</P>
<P>
	Christie survived a scare when a banned substance showed in his  
urine sample. However, the substance derived from ginseng in a 
health drink and was cleared as acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, Christie won $64,000 in libel damages from a  
magazine writer who said his track performances were the result of 
taking drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension comes a day after sprinter Dennis Mitchell  
received a two-year drug ban. The IAAF said Mitchell's drug test 
showed a high level of testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
	The American runner, who won the bronze medal behind Christie in  
Barcelona, is barred from the world championships, but because the 
ban is retroactive, Mitchell will be eligible for the 2000 Sydney 
Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Convicted Killer Executed in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A man who killed another man by hacking  
him to death with a sword made from a steel sawmill blade was 
executed by injection Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Blackmon, 41, was the first of six Texas death row inmates  
expected to receive lethal injection over the next two weeks. He 
was the 17th put to death so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy, honestly happy,'' Blackmon said in a recent  
interview. ``God has said to me: `Ricky, this is your ticket home.' 
And I'm going home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmon was sentenced to death for killing Carl Rinkle, 26, at  
Rinkle's home in east Texas in March 1987, and taking more than 
$600 in cash, a small pistol, some jewelry and cowboy boots. 
</P>
<P>
	The murder weapon was a sawtooth-edge steel sword. Rinkle's  
skull and throat were slashed, and he was stabbed 21 times in the 
back with a large hunting knife.

<HEADLINE> Pediatricians Suggest Limits on TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Children under 2 shouldn't watch television at  
all and older kids shouldn't have TVs in their rooms, the American 
Academy of Pediatrics recommends in a new report. 
</P>
<P>
	The report in this month's issue of Pediatrics magazine is the  
first from the 55,000-member academy on how to better manage 
children's use of television. Details were outlined in today's New 
York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	The group said TV viewing can affect the mental, social and  
physical health of young people. Its recommendations were based in 
part on the thinking that babies need close interaction with people 
for proper brain development -- and that TV time can take away from 
people time. 
</P>
<P>
	Pediatricians should also ask for a child's ``media history''  
along with a medical history, the report recommends. The academy is 
supplying members with a sample checklist for young patients, 
including questions about movies, video and computer games, music 
videos and the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Other recommendations include critical discussion of what  
children watch and keeping TVs and computers in common spaces where 
use can be monitored. 
</P>
<P>
	The academy, which spent two years developing the policy,  
suggested in 1990 that children be limited to one to two hours of 
``quality'' programming a day. In 1997 it launched a campaign to 
educate pediatricians on the influences television can have on 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Aggressiveness in older children has been linked to violence in  
movies and television in several studies by groups including the 
American Medical Association, the American Psychological 
Association and the National Institute of Mental Health.

<HEADLINE> College Edits Portion of Sex Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The University of Minnesota is rejecting  
efforts by a state agency, a newspaper and two alleged victims of 
sexual misconduct to see sections edited out of a report on the 
conduct of athletes and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the 233-page report by outside investigators on  
the university's handling of sexual assault and misconduct 
allegations was blanked out before the university released it in 
early July. 
</P>
<P>
	The report is one of two covering men's athletics. The second  
inquiry, into allegations of academic fraud in the university's 
basketball program, isn't expected to be done until the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The report reviewed about 40 accusations made against athletes  
of various types of sexual misconduct, including assault and 
harassment. It concluded that in some cases, school officials 
improperly intervened in the cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The Star Tribune reported in May that athletics officials  
sometimes had the cooperation of campus police as they helped 
players negotiate agreements in cases that were never submitted to 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Star Tribune sought access to the censored information in  
the report, and asked the state Department of Administration to 
review whether information was wrongly withheld. 
</P>
<P>
	But the university has refused to provide the edited portions.  
</P>
<P>
	The university also has denied requests by two women for  
information regarding their specific allegations that athletes who 
abused and harassed them were protected by school officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Rotenberg, university general counsel, wrote to the women's  
attorney that the information remains confidential because it is 
part of an active investigation. Rotenberg said federal and state 
laws allow the university to withhold information to protect the 
privacy of employees, students and victims.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Nears Senate Confirmation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Diplomatic troubleshooter Richard Holbrooke's  
longest mission, winning Senate confirmation to be U.N. ambassador, 
appeared near an end today. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who earlier had been  
among four senators holding up a final vote, suggested a final 
floor vote could come as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Holbrooke has always appeared to have overwhelming  
support in the Senate, it has been 14 months since President 
Clinton announced his selection for the top diplomatic post. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of delays has plagued the nomination, most recently a  
wave of parliamentary maneuvers by individual senators to delay a 
final vote, mostly over unrelated disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke, now an investment banker, is a former ambassador to  
Germany and was architect of the 1995 accord that ended the war in 
Bosnia. He has also served at Clinton's special envoy to the 
Balkans during the Kosovo crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott predicted Holbrooke's confirmation if Sen. Charles Grassley  
withdraws his opposition ``and there are no other issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley, R-Iowa, is the only remaining senator with a ``hold''  
on the Holbrooke nomination. Grassley has objected to the State 
Department's treatment of a whistle-blower Linda Shenwick. 
</P>
<P>
	A Grassley spokeswoman, Jill Kozeny, said that while talks  
between the senator and State Department on Shenwick's plight are 
continuing, ``Generally, Senator Grassley's concerns have been met. 
</P>
<P>
	``But he's going to take additional steps to make sure fairness  
returns,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley contends that Shenwick, who worked at the U.N. mission  
in New York, was demoted and transferred to a lesser job in 
Washington in retaliation for her telling members of Congress about 
waste and inefficiency at the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department has said Shenwick was reassigned because of  
unsatisfactory job performance, not because she was a 
whistle-blower. 
</P>
<P>
	John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Lott, said a floor vote could  
come at any time on the nomination as Congress prepares to leave 
for its August vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott had detected ``some movement'' in recent days in support of  
ending Holbrooke's long odyssey, Czwartacki said.

<HEADLINE> House Votes on Work Injuries Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New rules to help reduce employee ``repetitive  
strain'' injuries could not be issued until after a federal study 
is completed, under legislation passed by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House opposes the bill and has threatened to veto it.  
</P>
<P>
	The measure passed Tuesday, 217-209, would force the  
Occupational Safety and Health Administration to suspend its 
rule-making process until after the National Academy of Sciences 
reports its findings to Congress in January 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	A companion bill is pending in the Senate.  
</P>
<P>
	Critics said the bill would unnecessarily delay rules needed to  
help the 600,000 workers who suffer from repetitive strain injuries 
and other illness every year. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said the science on the issue was murky and that it  
made sense to require the Labor Department agency to wait for the 
study before moving forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one's here trying to prevent forever (the) regulations,''  
said Rep. Cass Ballenger, R-N.C., whose subcommittee has held 
hearings. ``We're here saying, 'Let's do it right. Let's get the 
scientific evidence first and then proceed.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Labor Secretary Alexis M. Herman criticized the bill, sponsored  
by Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., in a statement issued after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Blunt bill is the wrong answer,'' she said. ``If this  
legislation were to take effect, it would harm both workers and 
employers, which is why President Clinton would exercise his veto 
if it were to reach his desk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charles N. Jeffress, the OSHA administrator, said every major  
scientific, medical and professional organization involved in 
workplace safety issues has urged the agency to move forward with 
its new ergonomics standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Ergonomics is the science of tailoring a job to the worker to  
prevent musculoskeletal injuries caused by wear and tear on the 
body, such as back pain, tendinitis in the wrist and painful carpal 
tunnel syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to sit and wait and not go forward when the  
science is in,'' Jeffress added in an interview after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	OSHA released a draft proposal in February that would apply  
primarily to industrial jobs, such as meatpacking, sewing and 
assembly lines. But office workers who perform repetitive tasks 
such as typing also could be included. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules could require employers to alter work stations,  
redesign facilities or change the tools and equipment their 
employees use. Businesses also could be required to offer medical 
care and time off to injured workers. 
</P>
<P>
	OSHA has estimated the draft would cost $3.5 billion per year.  
The agency expects to issue a formal proposal in the fall, Jeffress 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 600,000 workers suffered serious injuries from  
overexertion or repetitive motion on the job in 1996, accounting 
for 34 percent of all ailments that caused employees to miss work, 
according to OSHA. 
</P>
<P>
	The injuries, caused when there is a mismatch between a job's  
physical requirements and the physical capacity of the human body, 
also cost employers $15 billion to $20 billion a year in workers' 
compensation, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Bonilla, R-Texas, who supported the bill, said safety  
measures adopted by the private sector have helped to reduce such 
injuries by 17 percent since 1995. ``There is no crisis at hand,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents said previous studies, including one last year by  
the NAS and another by the National Institute for Occupational 
Safety and Health, have confirmed links between repetitive motions 
on the job and workplace injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	They said OSHA should be allowed to proceed with the new rule.  
</P>
<P>
	``That delay does not hurt anybody in this room,'' Rep. David  
Obey, D-Wis., told colleagues. ``The only repetitive motion injury 
that members of Congress are likely to get are knee injuries from 
continuous genuflecting to big-business special interests who want 
us to put their profit margins ahead of worker health.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> NBA Trade Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Boston Celtics didn't want to meet Ron Mercer's asking  
price, so they shipped him to Denver. The Orlando Magic wanted to 
get younger, so they sent Nick Anderson to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	Two trades involving a total of eight players highlighted the  
offseason action in the NBA on Tuesday, with several free agents 
deciding to remain with their former teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Another trade was expected to be finalized today, the Clippers  
sending Lamond Murray to Cleveland for Derek Anderson and Johnny 
Newman in a sign-and-trade transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Bo Outlaw re-signed with Orlando, Nick Van Exel stayed in Denver  
and Derek Fisher landed a seven-year contract from the Lakers, who 
also were courting Charles Oakley with a recruiting pitch straight 
out of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want him so bad that Magic Johnson offered to let Oakley  
wear No. 32 if it would get the deal done,'' said Oakley's agent, 
Billy Diamond. ``I don't see us doing anything in the near 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the Phoenix Suns were reportedly closing in on a deal  
which would bring Penny Hardaway from the Orlando Magic in a 
sign-and-trade arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix radio station KMGE reported Tuesday night that the deal  
was completed, but Suns president Jerry Colangelo told the AP that 
nothing was final. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orlando Sentinal and The Tribune of Mesa reported that the  
Suns would send Pat Garrity, Danny Manning and two draft picks to 
the Magic in exchange for Hardaway. The Arizona Republic quoted 
league sources and a source close to Hardaway as saying he has told 
the Suns he wants to play in Phoenix and has agreed to contract 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercer was traded from the Celtics to the Nuggets in a  
six-player deal that also sent Popeye Jones and Dwayne Schintzius 
to Denver for Danny Fortson, Eric Washington, Eric Williams and a 
first-round draft choice in one of the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Anderson went to the Kings for guard Tariq Abdul-Wahid and  
a future No. 1 pick. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers-Cavaliers trade, as first reported by the Orange  
County Register, includes a seven-year, $25 million contract for 
Murray, who lost his starting job in Los Angeles 13 games into the 
1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavaliers apparently are making the deal after being scared  
off by Derek Anderson's asking price on a six-year extension. Like 
Mercer, Derek Anderson is represented by rap impressario Master P, 
also known as Percy Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortson, a 6-foot-7 forward who ranked fourth in the NBA in  
rebounding last season, is going into the final season of his 
three-year rookie contract -- just like Mercer and Derek Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston did not want to meet Mercer's asking price, which was  
around $60 million for a six-year extension. 
</P>
<P>
	``They offered $30 million,'' said Tevester Scott, the  
registered agent for Mercer and Derek Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercer can be a free agent next year, and indicated he wouldn't  
re-sign with Boston if he wasn't given an extension this summer.

	``We had no desire to trade Ron Mercer,'' coach Rick Pitino  
said. ``I could not even come close to the numbers Ron Mercer 
wanted as a basketball player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Anderson, 31, who has averaged 15.4 points and 5.3 rebounds  
in 10 NBA seasons, was the first draft pick of the expansion Magic 
in 1989. He was entering the third season of a four-year contract 
that, with incentives, could pay him more than $24 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sacramento is the talk of the league right now,'' he said.  
``Flash, run and gun, having a lot of fun -- that's what I like, to 
keep the fun in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Wahad, a 24-year-old shooting guard, has played two  
seasons with the Kings, who made him the 11th pick in the 1997 
draft. As a starter with the Kings last season, Abdul-Wahad 
averaged 9.3 points and 3.8 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Outlaw, Orlando's wiry 6-foot-8 forward, re-signed with the  
Magic for one year and $2 million. He said he turned down more 
lucrative offers elsewhere to remain in Orlando. Outlaw will have 
full Larry Bird rights next summer, meaning the Magic will be able 
to exceed the salary cap to re-sign him again. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Exel re-signed in Denver for a deal believed to be worth  
over $70 million for seven years, $50 million of which is 
guaranteed. The Nuggets also signed free agent forward George 
McCloud, who played in Phoenix last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher, who split time with Derek Harper at point guard last  
season for the Lakers, signed a seven-year contract worth about $24 
million. After signing Fisher, Los Angeles stopped their pursuit of 
Hardaway. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakley got the royal treatment from the Los Angeles Lakers --  
lunch with Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant and a tour of the new 
arena from Jerry West. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakley is demanding $8.5 million annually for three years from  
the Toronto Raptors, who have offered $5.5 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Contrary to what people in Toronto are saying, the Raptors  
haven't increased their offer,'' said Oakley's agent, Diamond, who 
accompanied the veteran power forward during his afternoon of 
courtship with the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakley is being courted by several teams seeking to add an  
experienced big body along the front line. He has been in Los 
Angeles since last weekend, attending Magic Johnson's charity game 
and playing golf with Lakers representatives 
</P>
<P>
	So eager are the Lakers to convince Oakley to sign that O'Neal  
and Bryant, not the best of friends during their three seasons 
together in Los Angeles, agreed to have lunch together with Oakley 
and Diamond. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakley later joined West and general manager Mitch Kupchak for a  
tour of the team's new practice facility and the Staples center, 
which will replace the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	``The meeting was best described as informative. Charles has  
some pointed questions about the chemistry of the team,'' Diamond 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Diamond also said the Hawks, Heat and Knicks remain interested  
in Oakley. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortson, who plays center and power forward, averaged 11.0  
points and 11.6 rebounds per game last year. His playing time 
increased considerably after rookie Raef LaFrentz went down early 
in the season with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercer, the sixth pick overall in the 1997 draft, averaged 17  
points last season. The 6-foot-7, 210-pound Mercer was an NBA 
All-Rookie Team selection in 1997-98 when he averaged 15.3 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal sends Williams back to the city where he played the  
first two years of his career. Williams averaged 15 points for the 
Celtics in 1996-1997. Last year in Denver, Williams averaged 7.3 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is entering the third year of a four-year, $30 million  
contract. Denver agreed to pay $3 million of Williams' contract 
this year, the maximum percentage allowed by the league. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets waived center Rony Seikaly, who played just 18 games in  
1 1/2 seasons with New Jersey because of injuries. New Jersey still 
owes Seikaly $4.5 million for the final season of his contract. The 
34-year-old was hampered by ankle and foot injuries during the 1999 
season.

<HEADLINE> HIV Mom Likely To Transmit to Baby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The higher the level of HIV in a pregnant woman's blood, the  
more likely she was to transmit the virus to her baby, two new 
studies found. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers also found that pregnant women with the highest  
levels of HIV were one-third less likely to transmit the virus if 
they were treated with the anti-retroviral drug AZT than those who 
were not. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were published in Thursday's edition of the New  
England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers concluded that aggressive anti-retroviral  
therapy is probably the best way to lower the risk that babies will 
be born with AIDS. However, they warned that the benefits must be 
weighed against the possible long-term effects of the drug, which 
are still unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	One study, led by Dr. Lynne Mofenson of the National Institutes  
of Health, looked at women who were treated with AZT while pregnant 
and whose babies also were treated with the drug for several weeks 
after birth. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 84 mothers in the study who had undetectable levels of  
the HIV at 20 to 30 weeks of pregnancy, none of the babies tested 
positive for HIV. 
</P>
<P>
	The second study, led by Dr. Patricia Garcia of Northwestern  
University, looked at 552 pregnant women from 1990 to 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	It found that among women with the highest levels of HIV,  
representing the most advanced cases of AIDS, 20 percent of those 
who had been treated with AZT transmitted the virus to their babies 
compared to a 63 percent transmission rate among those not treated 
with AZT. 
</P>
<P>
	In countries that cannot afford AZT treatment, about one-fourth  
of all babies born to HIV-positive mothers get the virus. Since AZT 
therapy became standard in the United States, that rate has dropped 
to 9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Isiah Thomas New Owner of CBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Isiah Thomas has big plans for his little league.  
</P>
<P>
	At first interested in acquiring an expansion franchise for  
Detroit, Thomas instead wound up paying $10 million to purchase the 
entire Continental Basketball Association and its nine franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	And he believes it's a great deal.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great business opportunity if we can put the right  
operational structure in place,'' Thomas said. ``The most important 
thing is to concentrate on being the best minor league system 
around. The CBA has been here since 1946 and plans to be around 
until 2046.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas' CBA involvement began innocently enough when he inquired  
about putting a team in Detroit, where he led the Pistons to 
consecutive NBA championships in 1989 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The next thing he knew, he owned the whole league, with Detroit  
on the back burner as a possible future expansion team. Also 
mentioned as areas the CBA might look to in the future were 
southern California and suburban Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas plans to reorganize the CBA from an association with 40  
owners into a single entity league. 
</P>
<P>
	``The franchises will be owned by the league,'' Thomas said.  
``This new single entity model will eliminate the inefficiencies of 
current franchise ownership. Under the single entity model, the 
nine teams will report to the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the league will control all aspects of team operations from  
player negotiations to marketing to revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	From a personal standpoint, Thomas sees his CBA connection as a  
natural progression. 
</P>
<P>
	``This completes the cycle of basketball for me, touching all  
the aspects of basketball,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After a 13-year playing career with the Pistons, he became part  
owner and general manager of the expansion Toronto Raptors. Then he 
moved into broadcasting as an analyst on NBC's coverage of the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``My interest is purely in basketball remaining healthy and the  
game continuing to grow, and protecting the sanctity of the game we 
all love,'' Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas wants the CBA to continue its role as a developmental  
league, a training ground for future NBA players and officials. He 
would also like to see the league's teams become directly 
affiliated with NBA clubs, moving players up and down with single 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on his agenda are possible exhibition games for CBA teams  
against NCAA teams, much like preseason games currently played 
against teams like Athletes In Action and touring European clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's for the future.  
</P>
<P>
	For now Thomas wants to build what he has.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have one goal -- to be the second best league in the  
world,'' he said. ``As a minor league, a developmental league, 
we're not in the driver's seat. We're passengers. We bring to the 
table the ability to enhance the property in each city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All this developed out of Thomas' dream to own an NBA team. He  
was forced to back off because he could not compete with corporate 
bankrolls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not given up on the NBA dream,'' he said. ``I learned a  
long time ago if your pocketbook can't support your dreams, you 
need to look elsewhere.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. May Buy Back $3.6 Trillion Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Talk about a head-spinning turnaround. The  
United States, which for most of the century has struggled to 
borrow money for the burgeoning national debt, is now faced with an 
altogether different dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since 1972, the government is figuring out  
ways to buy back debt held by the public. The country, born in debt 
from the Revolutionary War, has been out of the red only once, when 
Andrew Jackson fulfilled a campaign promise and wiped out the 
national debt, for a brief period, in 1835. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department on Wednesday issued proposed rules for  
the debt buyback operation and plans to finalize details by Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, President Clinton said his plans for the budget surplus  
were smart and sound compared with the Republicans' $792 billion 
tax cut. The president has promised to veto the package once it 
clears Congress this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants to use two-thirds of the projected surpluses over  
the next 15 years to eliminate the $3.6 trillion in debt held by 
the public. He said that approach would help the economy by 
lowering the government's borrowing demands and reducing interest 
rates paid by consumers and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	He likened the buyback plan to a family's decision to refinance  
a home mortgage at lower, more favorable interest rates in hopes of 
eventually paying off the entire mortgage and eliminating all 
interest payments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's refinance our nation's mortgage and then wipe the ledger  
clean,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said any government purchases of debt would be  
voluntary and conducted through a type of reverse auction. The 
government would announce the type of securities it was interested 
in buying and accept the most competitive bids from holders of 
those securities. 
</P>
<P>
	If bond holders wanted too much money to sell their securities  
back to the government, Treasury could decline to purchase that 
option. 
</P>
<P>
	Private economists generally gave the administration's proposal  
high marks. They said it would not disrupt the government's 
procedures for offering new Treasury bills, notes and bonds to 
investors, or upset the massive secondary market, where close to 
$200 billion in U.S. securities changes hands daily. 
</P>
<P>
	``This plan looks like sound fiscal management. It makes sense  
to pay down the debt and it makes sense to pay down higher-interest 
debt that was issued years ago first,'' said Mark Zandi, senior 
economist at Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury has not bought back securities since 1972, when a  
few existing bonds and notes held by the public were swapped for 
new debt issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Huge budget deficits in the 1980s and early 1990s caused the  
national debt to climb from less than $1 trillion, before Ronald 
Reagan became president, to $5.5 trillion now. Of that amount, $3.6 
trillion is in public hands; the rest is held by government trust 
funds, the largest of which is Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The government last year had its first budget surplus since  
1969, a record $69.2 billion. Those surpluses are projected to 
total $2.9 trillion over the next decade, providing the money the 
administration proposes to use to reduce the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration projects that by the end of the current  
budget year on Sept. 30, it will have lowered the national debt by 
$142 billion over the past two years by reducing the amount of new 
T-bills, notes and bonds that were issued and by not buying back 
securities already in private hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said taxpayers would save if  
the government buys back older, higher-interest-rate securities in 
private hands rather than continuing to issue new securities. 
</P>
<P>
	If the buyback does not go ahead, Treasury estimated the average  
maturity for government securities would rise from the current 5.4 
years to 7 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said a reduction of three basis points, or  
three-hundredths of a percentage point, on the government's debt 
holdings would translate into annual savings of $1 billion in 
interest payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Buying back existing debt rather than reducing new debt sales  
would maintain a sizable market for new securities, making them 
more attractive to investors because they will be able to count on 
an available supply. 
</P>
<P>
	That is important not just to the government but to businesses  
and homeowners because Treasury securities often are used as a 
pricing benchmark for private debt.

<HEADLINE> US Spent $500,000 on Kennedy Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane was first  
reported missing, the government sent sailors and pilots, aviation 
experts and two ships. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks later, federal costs are still being calculated.  
Estimates surpass $500,000 -- not including Air Force and Navy 
involvement -- but much of that would have been spent anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Some factors:  
</P>
<P>
	--The U.S. Coast Guard's total cost was close to $492,000.  
</P>
<P>
	--The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration spent about  
$55,000 to operate the Rude and Whiting -- ships that usually survey 
the ocean for updating nautical charts -- in the search for 
wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	--Forces from the Navy and Air Force were sent, including one  
ship that otherwise wouldn't have been at sea. The Defense 
Department would not release figures until it completes its review. 
</P>
<P>
	--The National Transportation Safety Board has embarked on an  
investigation that's expected to take six to nine months and 
involve numerous experts. But neither the NTSB or Federal Aviation 
Administration break down costs on a case-by-case basis, spokesmen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the federal government's role was extensive, it didn't  
come at the Kennedy family's request -- with one exception. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only request the family made was for the burial-at-sea,''  
said a family spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, President Clinton took responsibility for authorizing  
the extraordinary effort to recover the private plane. He based it 
on the Kennedy family's role ``in our national lives, and because 
of the enormous losses that they have sustained in our lifetimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The costs are hard to calculate, at least in terms of  
determining what was spent for the Kennedy crash that wouldn't have 
been spent otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the USS Briscoe, a Navy guided missile destroyer on  
which the Kennedys gathered privately to release the ashes of JFK 
Jr., his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and her sister, Lauren 
Bessette, costs roughly $100,000 a day to run, says the Federation 
of American Scientists, a nonprofit research group. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Briscoe, with a crew of about 380, was on a training  
mission off Virginia when it was diverted to the Kennedy mission, 
so some costs probably would have been incurred anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even on its way up there, it was able to do some of the  
training,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Lydia Robertson, a Navy spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the USS Grasp, a Navy salvage ship that retrieved  
about 75 percent of the plane, was sent from port. A ship like that 
typically has a crew of 100 and probably costs about $25,000 a day 
to operate, said John Pike, an analyst with the Federation of 
American Scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force contributed to the search as well.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would be puzzled if they came up with a number that was only  
tens of thousands for the air component,'' Pike said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard, meanwhile, would have incurred much of its  
$492,000 in costs even if it didn't help with the search because 
its personnel get the same pay whether they are on a mission or 
not, said Jack O'Dell, a Coast Guard spokesman. The only extra cost 
for the Kennedy mission would have been fuel, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise for NOAA, which would have had to spend about $30,000  
of its $55,000 expense regardless of the Kennedy crash, said Jeanne 
Kouhestani, a spokeswoman for the Commerce Department, which 
includes NOAA. That means the Kennedy mission cost the agency an 
additional $25,000.

<HEADLINE> Pacers' Bender Admits He's Behind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Jonathan Bender, nearly two weeks late for  
the Indiana Pacers' rookie camp, admits he has some catching up to 
do but isn't too worried about lost time. 
</P>
<P>
	Due to league restrictions, the 18-year-old Bender couldn't join  
the Pacers in the rookie camp which started July 23 because he was 
officially a Toronto Raptor until Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Bender, the Raptors' first-round pick in the June 30 NBA draft,  
was traded to the Pacers for veteran forward Antonio Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I'm going to be behind, but I adapt to situations  
pretty quickly and I think I'll be able to handle it,'' Bender 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Bender has been working with a personal  
trainer, lifting weights for an hour and a half each day to try to 
bulk up for the regular season. Since the draft, Bender has gained 
10 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-11, 200-pound forward is expected to sign a contract  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bender joins 19-year old Al Harrington as one of two teenagers  
on a largely veteran Pacer team. If Bender's rookie season in the 
NBA is anything like Harrington's, he can expect little playing 
time. That suits him just fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm considering learning a lot this year, just asking a lot of  
questions and learning from sight, learning from the veterans,'' 
Bender said. ``If I do well, I'll play but it's the coach's 
decision. I'm not going to sit on the bench and pout about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all aware that at his age he's got an awful lot of work  
to do in the NBA but he really has a legitimate chance of being a 
terrific NBA player,'' club president Donnie Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last year, Bender was a high school All-American out of  
Picayune, Miss. He said a lifelong dream to join the NBA convinced 
him to declare for the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just dreamed all my life that I would make it here and I  
just played hard, worked at it, shot balls in the middle of the 
night, thought about it, and finally made it here,'' Bender said. 
``Thank God for all that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But now that he's realized his dream, Bender said he wants to  
use the money to give back to his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to make sure my mom and my grandma don't work anymore.  
I'm not really worried about me right now, I'm worried about 
them,'' Bender said. ``They worked every day of their life. They've 
taken care of me so it's my turn to take care of them.''

<HEADLINE> Pediatricians Suggest Limits on TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There are bad vibes in the world of the  
``Teletubbies.'' Pediatricians want to take Tinky Winky, Dipsy, 
Laa-Laa and Po's audience away. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Academy of Pediatrics is advising parents to keep  
children younger than 2 away from television, which the distributor 
of the only television show aimed at that audience called 
unrealistic for today's parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bunch of malarkey,'' said Kenn Viselman, president of  
the itsy bitsy Entertainment Co., which distributes the British 
series on PBS stations. 
</P>
<P>
	The academy said research shows babies need direct interaction  
with adults for healthy brain growth, and said watching TV may 
interfere with activities that help develop social, emotional and 
cognitive skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Pediatricians should advise parents to keep children's rooms  
``electronic media-free,'' the academy said in a report published 
in this month's issue of the journal Pediatrics. 
</P>
<P>
	During routine visits, doctors should begin asking how children  
of all ages use TV, videos and computers, the report said. It even 
urged pediatricians to set an example by turning off the television 
in their waiting rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think this takes into account the way parents raise  
their children anymore,'' Viselman said. ``Parents use TV in three 
ways -- as an educator, a treat and a baby sitter. That's not going 
to change, and this report is not going to change it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Teletubbies,'' which premiered last year in the United States,  
features four colorful characters with a TV set implanted in their 
stomachs. They use the cooing voices that toddlers are used to 
hearing from adults. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of attacking shows that try to help children, the  
pediatricians should warn parents that they shouldn't watch ``The 
Jerry Springer Show'' when kids are in the room, Viselman said. 
</P>
<P>
	But an expert in children's TV said ``Teletubbies'' has given  
some parents the false feeling that their children would be missing 
something important if they didn't watch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's preposterous to put children under 2 in front of the  
TV,'' said Peggy Charren of Action For Children's Television, a 
group that lobbies for quality programming for kids. ``You should 
wait as long as possible, because once they get into it, it's 
awfully hard to turn it off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown Johnson, a senior vice president at Nickelodeon, said the  
academy's report ``very consistent with what we're trying to do.'' 
The cable network has programming aimed at children aged 2-5, but 
nothing for toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
	That's partly because research shows that most children need to  
be at least 2 to follow stories on television. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen Media Research, which measures TV viewing, also doesn't  
include children under age 2 in its research. So there's no 
financial incentive for advertiser-supported networks to reach this 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
	The report's timing is unfortunate for PBS, which last weekend  
announced a $40 million investment to develop six animated programs 
for pre-schoolers. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman said PBS wants pre-schoolers to watch the shows with  
their parents. PBS also wants children to seek out activities -- 
like reading books -- that reinforce what they see on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really think the AAP didn't have PBS in mind when they came  
up with this policy,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Senate Approves $7.4B in Farm Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate on Wednesday approved $7.4 billion  
in assistance for farmers hurt by depressed crop prices, setting 
the stage for negotiations with the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and some farm-state Republicans wanted more money,  
including special assistance for Eastern growers who are suffering 
through one of the region's worst droughts this century. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders beat back several attempts to fatten the package,  
but signaled their willingness to consider adding money later 
during talks with the House. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this is a very strong program. ... It's a strong  
commitment,'' said Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said the Senate action should be  
a ``clear signal'' to farmers and their bankers that help will be 
on the way this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaylen Affield, who grows corn, soybeans and wheat near Fergus  
Falls, Minn., was cheered by the Senate action. ``The government 
has to do something here because we can't produce at these 
prices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On an 89-8 vote, the $7.4 billion money was added to an  
Agriculture Department spending bill for the fiscal year beginning 
Oct. 1. The $68 billion bill was later passed on a voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The House didn't put any such assistance in its version of the  
bill, but Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said recently the House 
is ``committed to taking decisive action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A House-Senate conference committee will negotiate the final  
shape of the assistance package, with negotiations starting in 
September after Congress returns from a monthlong recess. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for corn, soybeans, wheat and other crops have slumped to  
lows not seen by farmers in years, even decades in some cases, 
because of huge crops worldwide. Federal farm subsidies already 
were expected to reach a near record $16.7 billion even without the 
additional assistance Congress is considering. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats unsuccessfully sought $500 million in disaster aid for  
drought-stricken growers on the East Coast and Midwest farmers 
whose land is flooded. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to have some money for disaster  
assistance,'' said Mary Kay Thatcher, a lobbyist for the American 
Farm Bureau Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's aid package includes $5.5 billion in direct  
payments to most growers, a separate $475 million for soybean 
growers, $400 million in subsidies for crop insurance, $328 million 
for tobacco growers and $325 million in livestock assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also would raise the cap on crop subsidies that an  
individual farmer can receive from $150,000 to $300,000, a change 
sought by Southern growers. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Democrats had proposed a total of $11 billion  
in assistance but conceded defeat after losing battles Wednesday 
afternoon over several smaller packages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throwing a short rope to someone who is drowning in deep water  
is a nice gesture, but it's not a lifesaving gesture,'' said Sen. 
Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. ``One of the facts of life for us is that we 
don't control the Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The debate became something of a referendum on the 1996 farm  
law, popularly known as ``Freedom to Farm,'' which scaled back 
production-based crop subsidies. Democrats wanted to put the bulk 
of the disaster aid into raising crop subsidies, but Republicans 
said that would appear to be undoing the 1996 law. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight senators who voted against the aid package were  
Republicans Phil Gramm of Texas, Judd Gregg and Bob Smith of New 
Hampshire, George Voinovich of Ohio and Connie Mack of Florida, and 
Democrats Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, Bob Graham of Florida and 
Robert Torricelli of New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate move intended to boost farm exports, the Senate  
added a provision to the spending bill requiring the president to 
get congressional approval before including food or medicine in a 
trade embargo. The only exceptions would be for governments deemed 
to be sponsoring terrorism, including Cuba, Iraq and Libya.	   ``When the U.S. uses food as a diplomatic weapon, by imposing 
unilateral agricultural embargoes against foreign leaders, it takes 
away from our farmers their ability to sell their product,'' said 
Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo.

<HEADLINE> Seifert Laments Panthers' Poor Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPARTANBURG, S.C. (AP) -- It was bad enough that the Carolina  
Panthers were stricken by an outbreak of the training-camp blahs 
Wednesday. Making matters worse was that the boss was on hand for a 
rare view of his troops. 
</P>
<P>
	For the better part of two hours, the Panthers spent their  
morning workout at Wofford College putting on a clinic in 
inefficiency. Snap counts were forgotten, handoffs were missed, 
passes were dropped, blocking assignments were blown and players 
seemed to be moving in slow motion. 
</P>
<P>
	Watching all of this while alternately sitting in a golf cart or  
standing along the sidelines, his arms folded across his chest, was 
owner Jerry Richardson. It was Richardson's first appearance at 
training camp this year, and it couldn't have come at a worse time, 
at least as far as new coach George Seifert was concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert, signed in January to a five-year, $12 million contract  
by Richardson, had envisioned marking the owner's visit to 
Spartanburg with a nice, crisp workout. The coach even joked with 
the Panthers before practice about how they would celebrate showing 
the owner how far they had come in such a short time under Seifert 
in their bid to rebound from last year's 4-12 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of practice, we had a certain group lined up that  
was going to carry me off the field,'' Seifert said, managing a 
weak chuckle. ``Believe me, I squelched that. It's kind of one of 
those things that when I see Jerry now, I kind of wave and walk in 
the other direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert made several attempts to snap his players out of the  
doldrums. He repeatedly gathered the Panthers for a team huddle and 
spoke to them about the virtues of hard work, concentration and the 
like. 
</P>
<P>
	But shortly after one such huddle, the practice hit a low point  
when reserve quarterback Jeff Lewis took a center snap, wheeled to 
turn back into the pocket -- and fell flat on his face. As the ball 
squirted loose and rolled away, some coaches threw up their arms. 
Others blew whistles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not flicking in the towel by any means,'' said Seifert,  
who has the highest winning percentage of any coach in NFL history. 
``And to say that you might not expect this from time to time -- you 
do. But the players, they've got to accept the responsibility that 
they've got to at least take the snap from center, they've got to 
at least make a catch, they've got to at least tenaciously go block 
people. And until we do that, we'll just kind of show up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson declined to speak with reporters about the practice,  
but Seifert was more than willing to talk passionately on the 
subject. The coach was particularly pointed when he was reminded 
that the defensive line was thinned by the absence of starters 
Jason Peter and Tim Morabito, who sat out the practice to rest what 
were described as minor leg muscle pulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the scary part,'' Seifert said. ``What we did have kind  
of knocked our offense's butts off. We weren't able to run any 
plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert said part of the execution problems likely could be tied  
to the fact that he is instituting a new system at Carolina. While 
Seifert has been using parts or all of the system throughout his 
17-year NFL career, almost all of the Panthers are just seeing it 
for the first time, and they're still trying to get comfortable 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got so many things going in right now, so many plays,  
and there's no specific execution,'' he said. ``So we're working at 
about -- I think I can optimistically say -- 10 percent efficiency as 
far as where we're going to have to be.''

<P>
	Family members told KFOR-TV in Oklahoma City that Shepard, 35,  
was playing racquetball in Laramie, Wyo., when he collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard, who was to coach wide receivers for Wyoming this coming  
season, led the Cowboys in total punt return yardage and yards per 
punt return in 1989 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	A wide receiver on the 1985 national championship Oklahoma  
football team, Shepard also spent some time with the Washington 
Redskins in 1987 and the New Orleans Saints in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Senators Seek Farm Aid Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eager to placate farmers hurt by drought and  
depressed crop prices, senators hope to work out a compromise this 
week between Republican and Democratic aid plans that are $4 
billion apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers are telling their senators: ``They want action, they  
want votes, some indication that something will happen,'' said 
Idaho Sen. Larry Craig, one of several Republicans negotiating with 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican-controlled Senate defeated a $11 billion  
Democratic plan 54-44 on Tuesday after Democrats narrowly failed, 
51-47, to kill the $7 billion GOP emergency farm package. A final 
vote on the Republican plan was put off while Democrats and 
Republicans tried to find a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides had reason to work out a deal before lawmakers leave  
for a monthlong recess. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats don't want to be held responsible for killing an aid  
package. Farm-state Republicans worry that conservatives who think 
even the GOP plan is excessive will desert it. It's also possible 
for a senator to block the aid on procedural grounds because it 
would exceed annual spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday night, Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., offered a $7.5  
billion proposal containing disaster assistance not in the original 
Republican plan. Democrats said the GOP package wouldn't help many 
of the farmers who need it most, including drought-stricken growers 
on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good news is there's bipartisan recognition that there's a  
disaster out there,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The money would be added to an annual spending bill for the  
Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The House has yet to consider farm aid, although Speaker Dennis  
Hastert has said he's committed to passing something. 
</P>
<P>
	A worldwide glut of grain has depressed commodity prices low for  
the second year in a row, and Agriculture Department estimates that 
net farm income will dip to $43.8 billion this year, about 4 
percent below the inflation-adjusted average for the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, drought has parched crops from New York to Virginia.  
Although the drought isn't likely to push commodity prices up, it 
has galvanized support for farm assistance among East Coast 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen this before and it shouldn't surprise us. Whenever  
commodity prices fall and there's a certain amount of dislocation 
among some producers, then there's going to be a political 
response,'' said Kevin Kliesen, an economist with the Federal 
Reserve Bank of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers themselves have mixed opinions about what Congress  
should do. 
</P>
<P>
	While there's widespread support for some kind of assistance,  
there's disagreement about the best way to deliver the aid or how 
much growers need. And there is concern that some growers will use 
the cash to bid up farm rents to expand their operations. 
</P>
<P>
	And some farmers ``don't want any payment at all for fear of  
what it may do. Others need it right now,'' said Edward 
Wiederstein, a grain and hog producer who is president of the Iowa 
Farm Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, some Republicans are worried that they're getting  
into a bidding war with Democrats. During last fall's congressional 
campaigns, Republicans proposed $4 billion in farm aid only to have 
the president veto the package and force them to add $2 billion 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're competing to show compassion with other people's  
money,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.

<HEADLINE> Study Dates Oxygen Organisms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The earliest direct evidence of organisms pumping oxygen into  
Earth's atmosphere has been found in the ancient remains of 
bacterial slime that turned up in Australia, researchers reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2 1/2 billion-year-old molecular fossils show that early forms  
of life began paving the evolutionary path for oxygen-breathing 
animals at least 700 million years earlier than previously known. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life wouldn't be what it is today if we didn't have oxygen in  
the atmosphere and in the ocean,'' said Roger Summons, the chief 
research scientist for the Australian Geological Survey 
Organization and the lead author of the study in today's journal 
Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	The research may also provide a tool in the search for life on  
Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists had long suspected that organisms called  
cyanobacteria first started converting sunlight and carbon dioxide 
into food energy and oxygen billions of years ago. But no evidence 
had been previously found in fossils. 
</P>
<P>
	Summons and his colleagues tested samples from a drill core in  
Western Australia's Hammersley Basin, one of the most geologically 
stable areas on Earth, and later, samples from Mexico, Germany and 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	They discovered a durable molecular signature -- ``fingerprints''  
-- unique to certain cyanobacteria that lived on the shores of the 
ancient oceans, long before plants, animals and other complex life 
emerged. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first good evidence of early oxygenic  
photosynthesis,'' said Jere Lipps, professor of biology at the 
University of California, Berkeley. ``That's important because we 
couldn't be certain based on microfossils or other geologic 
evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The technique of identifying the molecular signature of ancient  
organisms also could be used in the hunt for life elsewhere in the 
universe. 
</P>
<P>
	David McKay, a NASA researcher who led a 1996 team that  
announced a meteorite from Mars showed evidence of ancient life, 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really potentially useful,'' he said Wednesday. ``We  
think that this is the first of a number of molecular biomarkers 
that may be documented in the future and that can be applied 
directly to returned Mars samples.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The markers discovered by Summons' team survived 2 1/2 billion  
years on Earth. Mars, a quieter place geologically, could preserve 
the record even longer, McKay said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forms of cyanobacteria exist today, often referred to as  
blue-green algae because they resemble the slimy substance. They 
can be found in places like the hot springs of Yellowstone National 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The microbes may have been pumping oxygen into the atmosphere  
for as long as 3 1/2 billion years -- 1 billion years after the Earth 
formed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The further you go back, there are fewer and fewer  
well-preserved samples,'' said Linda Jahnke, a study co-author and 
bacteriologist at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field. 
``It's a fact of the reworking of the surface of the Earth. Things 
are being buried all the time.''

<HEADLINE> Raiders' Ware retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAPA, Calif. (AP) -- Andre Ware, who won the Heisman Trophy in  
1989 as a record-setting quarterback at Houston, has retired from 
the NFL, the Oakland Raiders said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ware, a first-round draft choice by Detroit in 1990, played in  
the Canadian Football League last season, then signed with Oakland 
this spring and was assigned to NFL Europe for development. He 
fractured his left shoulder midway through the schedule and fell 
hopelessly behind in camp with the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
	Ware, who runs a computer business, hasn't played in the NFL  
since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Raiders coach Jon Gruden said Ware informed him of the decision  
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Andre was in a tough situation, and wasn't getting may  
opportunities to show what he could do. It's unfortunate,'' Gruden 
said. ``He was hurt and we really liked some of the things that 
(rookie quarterback) Scott Dreisback was doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, the Raiders signed Ray Zellars, who started  
seven games for New Orleans last year, and Tyrone Wheatley, who was 
cut by Miami on Tuesday and played only sporadically for the New 
York Giants in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Zellars rushed for 162 yards and one touchdown on 56 carries for  
New Orleans before being picked up on waivers by Cincinnati. The 
Bengals didn't invite him to camp this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheatley had 14 carries for 52 yards with the Giants last year.  
</P>
<P>
	Zellars, a 1995 second-round draft pick out of Notre Dame, was  
brought in as a replacement for fullback and short-yardage 
specialist Zack Crockett, a free-agent acquisition from 
Jacksonville who fractured his right foot on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheatley was a first-round pick by the Giants in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Heston Mesmerizes Packed Theater </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Charlton Heston mesmerized a packed theater with  
memories of Jimmy Stewart, Orson Welles and Robert De Niro -- all to 
help a young drama student pay his college fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The 75-year-old star of ``Ben Hur'' and ``The Planet of the  
Apes'' agreed to appear at the Roses Theater at Tewkesbury after 
student Nick Wilkes wrote to ask for his help. 
</P>
<P>
	Heston agreed to be interviewed on stage by Wilkes, 25, who was  
struggling to find $4,000 to cover tuition at the Bristol Old Vic 
Theater School. 
</P>
<P>
	The capacity audience of 350 welcomed the veteran star onto the  
stage with a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the 75-minute show, Heston commended Wilkes for  
having ``the common sense to ask for what he wanted, which he did 
very politely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought, `Where is he going to get a theater from?' but he  
did, and more importantly, he filled it,'' Heston said. Wilkes 
works at the theater as a projectionist. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount raised was not released.

<HEADLINE> Statistics Show Terrorism Declining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The heightened U.S. concern over terrorism and the intense drive  
to fortify American missions in the wake of recent threats comes at 
a time when statistics indicate terrorism in general, and 
state-sponsored terrorism in particular, is on the decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Total terrorist strikes last year were at a 20-year low -- 273  
compared with a peak of 666 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven countries remain on the State Department's list of  
international terrorism sponsors: Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North 
Korea, Sudan and Syria. 
</P>
<P>
	But the State Department's latest assessments indicate softened  
attitudes towards each: 
</P>
<P>
	--Cuba is no longer accused of supporting armed struggle in Latin  
America. The Clinton administration denies any warming of relations 
but is promoting contacts between Americans and Cubans through 
increased commercial flights and other actions. 
</P>
<P>
	--Iran has a president perceived as a moderate and the  
administration has refused to embrace opponents trying to topple 
the regime. 
</P>
<P>
	--Libya finally has handed over two suspects for a Netherlands  
trial in the 1989 bombing of PanAm Flight 103 that killed 270 
people, including 189 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	--North Korea has not been linked to an international terrorist  
incident since 1987, and the United States is trying to ease into 
better relationships with an agreement to end any nuclear weapons 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	--Syria's last known export of terrorism was in 1986, and  
improved relations are a likely goal in the renewed effort to 
foster Mideast peace. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sanctions were eased last month against Iran, Libya and Sudan  
to allow American companies to sell them some farm products, 
medicine and medical equipment.

<HEADLINE> For-Profit Hospitals Said Costlier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For-profit hospitals drive up the cost of care for Medicare  
patients in their communities, researchers reported today in a 
study that contradicts arguments that they manage costs and 
services more efficiently than nonprofit hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare spending in communities served only by for-profit  
hospitals grew faster from 1989 to 1995 than spending in areas 
served by nonprofits or a mix of both, Veterans Affairs and 
Dartmouth College researchers found. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, published in today's New England Journal of Medicine,  
looked at 3,436 hospital service areas -- some in rural areas with 
only one hospital, others in cities where residents could choose 
among half a dozen or more. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors of the study said Medicare spending grew nearly 50  
percent faster in communities where hospitals converted from 
nonprofit to for-profit ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that average annual Medicare spending in  
communities served by nonprofits was $3,554 per elderly resident in 
1989, compared to $4,006 in areas served by for-profits -- a gap of 
$452. Mixed areas fell in between. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1995, the gap had grown to $732, with average Medicare  
spending per person in nonprofit areas of $4,440 per year, compared 
to $5,172 in for-profit areas. 
</P>
<P>
	All hospitals have an incentive to maximize Medicare  
reimbursements, but administrators of for-profit hospitals face 
additional pressure ``because they must respond to markets and 
shareholders,'' said Dr. Elliot Fisher, the study's senior author. 
</P>
<P>
	About 797 out of the 5,057 U.S. hospitals are investor-owned,  
and the rate of conversion from nonprofit to for-profit is 
increasing. 
</P>
<P>
	One way that for-profit hospitals increase their Medicare  
reimbursements is by aggressively referring patients to nursing 
homes, rehabilitation centers and home health care agencies they 
own, said Dr. Steffie Woolhandler, a Harvard Medical School 
professor who co-wrote an accompanying editorial. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, an elderly woman who breaks her hip might spend  
seven days in a nonprofit hospital, then get outpatient physical 
therapy. But a for-profit hospital might keep her only two days, 
then transfer her to an affiliated rehab center for 12 days, 
Woolhandler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both hospitals would collect the same amount of Medicare money  
for her hospital stay, regardless of its length. But the for-profit 
hospital would collect additional money for the time the patient 
spent in the rehab center, Woolhandler said. 
</P>
<P>
	One shortcoming of the VA-Dartmouth study is that the authors  
failed to adjust for the socioeconomic status of residents in the 
hospital service areas, said Jose Escarce, head of health care 
financing policy research at the RAND Corp. think tank. 
</P>
<P>
	``More affluent elderly people get more care'' because they  
carry private Medigap insurance that allows them to take advantage 
of more supplemental services, Escarce said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carmela Coyle, senior vice president for policy for the American  
Hospital Association, which represents both for-profit and 
nonprofit hospitals, said the study also failed to account for 
other factors known to drive Medicare spending, such as regional 
variations in standards of practice. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the study's authors said they adjusted for the  
percentage of residents in urban areas, regional factors, and 
mortality rates.

<HEADLINE> Pediatricians Suggest Limits on TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Children under 2 shouldn't watch television at  
all, not even ``Barney'' or ``Sesame Street,'' the American Academy 
of Pediatrics recommends. 
</P>
<P>
	And older children should not be allowed to have televisions or  
computers in their bedrooms, the 55,000-member academy said in a 
report in this month's issue of the journal Pediatrics. 
</P>
<P>
	The academy said research shows direct interaction with parents  
and other caregivers is necessary for babies' and toddlers' healthy 
brain growth and the development of social, emotional and cognitive 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Watching television may interfere with that interaction, the  
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	TV viewing also can affect the physical health of young people,  
the academy said, and pediatricians should take a ``media history'' 
of patients to go along with the traditional medical history. 
</P>
<P>
	The medical organization is giving its members a questionnaire  
for young patients, asking about their time spent on movies, 
computer games and the Internet. The pediatrician could then 
counsel parents about areas of concern, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The importance is to get the message out to people that TV and  
media consumption has significant health effects on children,'' 
said Dr. Miriam Bar-on, chairwoman of the academy's committee on 
public education, who helped write the study. She suggested 
children be encouraged to play outside, read books or work with 
puzzles or games. 
</P>
<P>
	And while tots under 2 shouldn't be watching TV, she added, ``If  
it's a 3-year-old and `Sesame Street' is on and parents want that 
half-hour of peace, there's nothing wrong with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for PBS, which recently announced a $40 million  
investment to create six animated programs for pre-schoolers, said 
he didn't believe broadcasters and pediatricians were at odds over 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	PBS encourages youngsters to watch TV with their parents, to be  
selective in their viewing and to seek out other activities -- like 
reading books -- that reinforce what they see on television, said 
spokesman Harry Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the U.S. marketer of ``Teletubbies,'' which is  
specifically geared to youngsters under 2, took offense. 
</P>
<P>
	The report is ``a bunch of malarkey'' because it doesn't take  
into account how parents raise their children, said marketer Kenn 
Viselman. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,000 studies have concluded that exposure to media  
violence can increase the risk of aggressive behavior in some 
children and adolescents, the academy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The academy also pointed to the high sexual content of  
television shows, the glamorization of tobacco and alcohol use, and 
the tendency of people who watch a lot of television to be 
overweight. 
</P>
<P>
	The academy noted that the average American child spends 21  
hours a week watching television. It said that demonstrates the 
need for media education programs in schools that could teach 
children to look at the messages they get from the media with more 
critical eyes.

<HEADLINE> China Warns U.S. on Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China warned the U.S. Congress today against  
backing any move by Taiwan toward independence, saying Beijing was 
ready to pay ``any price'' to defend China's claim to the island. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning came amid renewed tensions between China and Taiwan  
sparked by Taiwan President Lee-Teng-hui's insistence that the two 
sides should deal with each other as one state to another. 
</P>
<P>
	China regarded Lee's July 9 remarks as a move toward  
independence for Taiwan, which has ruled itself separately from 
Beijing since the two sides split in 1949 in a civil war. China 
views the island as a renegade province and has threatened to use 
force to stop it from formally declaring independence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will defend the state sovereignty and territorial integrity  
of our motherland at any price,'' the official Xinhua News Agency 
quoted a senior legislator as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The report did not identify him, other than saying he was a  
senior member of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chinese 
legislature, the National People's Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The official also accused Rep. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and other  
House members of inflaming tensions between China and Taiwan by 
introducing a bill that ``bluntly advocated'' independence for 
Taiwan, Xinhua said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, introduced July 29 to the House Committee on  
International Relations, will ``gravely damage peace and stability 
in the Asia-Pacific region, as well as the relations between China 
and the United States,'' the legislator was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	He appealed to Congress to shelve the bill.  
</P>
<P>
	In Taiwan today, Defense Minister Tang Fei said the island's  
armed forces will be tough but restrained amid increased military 
activity over the Taiwan Strait. 
</P>
<P>
	Tang did not comment directly on reports of stepped up sorties  
by planes and ships from both sides. But he said the strait is in 
international waters and Taiwan's key interest is ensuring safe 
usage for civilian aviation and shipping. 
</P>
<P>
	``We follow international law and are extremely self-disciplined  
in the spirit and in the means we use to handle these matters,'' 
Tang said. ``We don't wish to see any provocation but will do what 
is necessary'' to ensure national security. 
</P>
<P>
	Ministry spokesman Kung Fan-ding told the TVBS cable news  
network that military activity in the strait has been ``more than 
normal,'' but added that July and August have traditionally been 
the high season for Chinese training due to optimum weather 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Military observers say Taiwan's air force has increased patrols  
in the strait and navy sailors say they have been placed on a 
greater state of readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	Kung denied reports that Chinese military planes and ships have  
crossed the strait's center line, a hazy boundary that the two 
sides generally respect as the limit of their military activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government said Tuesday it was concerned increased  
sorties by China and Taiwan over the waterway could lead to 
accidents and advised both sides against anything that would 
heighten tensions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a pick up of activity by both sides,'' said  
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon. ``We urge both sides to show 
restraint.''

	FBI Holds Turkish Man in Custody  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A Turkish man removed from a Delta Air Lines  
flight before it left for Istanbul was held today for an expired 
visa as the FBI investigated what it would refer to only as the 
man's suspicious behavior. Hakan Caglar, 35, attracted the 
suspicion of law enforcement officials when he retrieved his 
luggage from a U-Haul truck yesterday and paid cash for a one-way 
ticket to Turkey at a Valdosta airport. Caglar, who had been in the 
United States since March 7, is being held by the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service because his visa expired June 6, an INS 
official said.

	Buchanan May Leave Republican Party  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pat Buchanan may bolt to the Reform Party  
because of concerns that the Republican nomination process is 
geared in favor of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, and that he has 
little chance of winning or even pushing his social and economic 
issues. The decision, which is not expected until the fall, may 
depend on an Aug. 14 contest in Iowa testing the political strength 
of nine Republican presidential candidates, said officials close to 
Buchanan and in the Reform Party. Republican leaders worry that a 
Buchanan defection would drain support of the GOP's most 
conservative voters from the party's eventual nominee.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The sick, poor and elderly who need  
prescriptions would suffer from a bill that would extend patents on 
seven drugs, a former senator who represents consumer groups said 
today. Howard Metzenbaum of the Consumer Federation of America said 
the legislation would block manufacturers of generic drugs from 
making cheaper versions of brand-name medicines. ``The bill is 
essentially a tax on the uninsured, the poor, the sick and the 
elderly,'' Metzenbaum, a former Democratic senator from Ohio, told 
the Senate Judiciary Committee.

	Fen-Phen Suit Seeks Medical Care

	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Thousands of healthy New Jersey residents  
who took the fen-phen diet drugs want one of the drug makers to pay 
for years of medical checkups to detect any signs of heart and lung 
problems. Complaints forced the drugs off the market in 1997. 
American Home Products -- which made fenfluramine -- could be forced 
to pay more than $1 billion over the next decade if it loses the 
trial. Jury selection in the case began earlier this week. An 
economist estimated that American Home Products would have to pay 
$1.5 billion for a decade of regular checkups for the 94,000 
residents who took the drug combination for at least three months.

	Removing Predators Has Consequences  
</P>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- House cats and other small animals are becoming  
the dominant predators in many of San Diego's rugged canyons, 
replacing wild coyotes that were driven away by urban development, 
according to a new study. Because cats, opossums, skunks and 
raccoons are no longer preyed on, they are free to eat more rodents 
and birds, threatening their populations, said biologist Kevin 
Crooks, co-author of the study in tomorrow's journal Nature. ``It 
shows if you destroy habitat and remove components of an ecosystem, 
effects are seen throughout,'' said Lee McClenaghan, professor of 
biology at San Diego State University.

university bought the collection from his sister, Esther Steinbeck 
Rodgers. The collection includes a draft of Steinbeck's speech

hundreds of family photos and nearly 400 of Steinbeck's letters to

not used the supplement for four months. McGwire, who has hit 42 
homers this year and is one short of No. 500, made the revelation 
before his St. Louis Cardinals played the San Diego Padres. McGwire 
said the fact his record 70-homer season was linked to andro, a 
testosterone booster, likely encouraged youngsters to try it. That 
was perhaps the biggest reason for his decision.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys' Aikman Motivated, at Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA FALLS, Texas (AP) -- There was a time when Troy Aikman  
couldn't imagine playing football beyond age 30, and there was a 
stretch not long ago when he really did think about retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that he's heading toward his 33rd birthday and going into  
his 11th season, the Dallas Cowboys quarterback is playing too well 
and having too much fun to consider giving it all up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still feel like my best years are ahead of me,'' Aikman  
said. ``I still feel like I can go out and play at a high level, 
compete and do the things I need to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Aikman talked about plans to play 3-5 more seasons  
yet leave while still playing at a high level and a desire for the 
Cowboys to again be among the NFL's elite. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy with where I'm at personally and  
professionally,'' said Aikman, a three-time Super Bowl champion who 
in the offseason regained his status as the highest-paid player in 
football and became engaged. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm as intense about the game and as driven and as passionate  
as I've ever been. Sometimes I try to back off a little bit and not 
be quite as competitive as I am in certain situations, but that's 
my makeup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to win the Super Bowl as badly today as I did before I  
won the first one. I'd be highly disappointed if I left the game 
and didn't win another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Cowboys have won only one playoff game in the three  
seasons since their last championship, Aikman said he believes they 
have the talent to win it all this year. 
</P>
<P>
	If they don't, it would be the longest championship drought of  
his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I didn't think we were willing to do everything we could as  
a team and as an organization, I would not have redone my 
contract,'' said Aikman, who will receive $85.5 million through 
2007 under an extension signed in April. ``I'd like our football 
team to get back to the respectability we once had and I think 
we're on track for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Aikman hopes to leave the NFL on top like John Elway, he  
added that he wouldn't retire if Dallas won the Super Bowl this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still healthy and my arm still feels good,'' Aikman said.  
``Barring an injury, I think I can play three to five more years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't long ago that Aikman thought about retiring because  
the game wasn't fun. He was rejuvenated by the departure of coach 
Barry Switzer and the arrival of offense-minded Chan Gailey. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys were 10-6 last year in Gailey's debut season and won  
the NFC East, only to be knocked out of the playoffs in the first 
round with a 20-7 loss to Arizona that Aikman called embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
	That loss completed a five-game slide caused mainly by a  
struggling offense. The bad ending overshadowed the team's 
turnaround from 6-10 the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's fair to be critical over the last four, five  
games, but we finished eighth in offense and at one time we were 
third,'' Aikman said. ``If I hadn't missed five games due to 
injury, it statistically could very well have been my best year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman expects the offense to improve this year because players  
are more comfortable with Gailey's system. He's also encouraged by 
upgraded talent on the offensive line and at receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an opportunity to have one of the better offenses  
since I've been here,'' Aikman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey has talked about trying to rest Michael Irvin early in  
the season in hopes of having him fresher for the playoffs. Aikman 
said he's not sure that plan will work. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be awfully hard to say `Hey, we need to rest  
you.' He's too valuable to the team and too competitive,'' Aikman 
said. ``I think when the game's on the line, he's still the guy I'm 
going to try to get the ball to.''

<P>
	Pedro Martinez is back for the Boston Red Sox. Just not  
completely 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez allowed one run in five innings in his first start back  
from his first stint on the disabled list, but the Boston bullpen 
couldn't hold the lead in a 5-4 loss to the Cleveland Indians on 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually I'm the one that's allowed to go a little longer, but  
today was an exception,'' Martinez said of his early exit. 
``Hopefully, next time I'll be out there for longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Thome's second home run tied the game, and Omar Vizquel  
singled in the game-winner in the ninth to give the Indians their 
seventh win in eight games and spoil Martinez' return from a 
shoulder injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez struck out seven in five innings at Fenway Park before  
leaving after 78 pitches. Seeking his 100th career victory, he left 
with a 4-2 lead before Tim Wakefield (3-8) blew his second save of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Thome hit a solo homer off Martinez in the second inning, then  
added a two-run shot off Wakefield in the eighth to tie it at 4. In 
the ninth, Wakefield walked two before Vizquel singled in David 
Justice for the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you can get a hit off Pedro, let alone a home run,  
it's kind of nice,'' Thome said. ``Pedro's Pedro. He's always going 
to put his team in a position to win. I know he was on the disabled 
list, but he still had great stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other AL games, it was Toronto 3, New York 1; Seattle 5,  
Tampa Bay 2; Texas 9, Minnesota 5; Oakland 12, Baltimore 2; Kansas 
City 7, Anaheim 0; and Chicago 9, Detroit 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez was 15-3 with a 2.10 ERA in the first half and started  
for the AL in the All-Star game, striking out the first four 
batters he faced -- and five in two innings -- to win the game's MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	But in his first start after that, he had the worst outing of  
his career, allowing nine runs, seven earned, and 12 hits in 3 2-3 
innings. After that, he missed a start for the first time in his 
major league career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went seven years without missing a start,'' he said.  
``Hopefully, it will be another seven before I miss another one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Shuey (7-4) earned the win and Mike Jackson pitched the  
ninth for his 24th save. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Blue Jays 3, Yankees 1    	
</P>
<P>
	At New York, Joey Hamilton pitched six strong innings and Tony  
Batista hit a tiebreaking single in the seventh as Toronto beat New 
York for the first time in eight tries this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton (4-6) cruised through the first five innings,  
scattering three hits and facing just two over the minimum before 
Joe Girardi led off the sixth with his first homer since July 9, 
1998, tying it 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Jays recaptured the lead an inning later when Homer  
Bush doubled and scored on Batista's single off David Cone (10-6). 
Billy Koch pitched the ninth for his 22nd save. 
</P>
<P>
 *Mariners 5, Devil Rays 2    	
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay's Wade Boggs went 1-for-3 and closed within four hits  
of 3,000, but Seattle tied its longest winning streak of the season 
at six. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie left-hander John Halama (9-2) tied the Mariners' record  
by winning his ninth straight decision and Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex 
Rodriguez homered for Seattle on consecutive pitches in the fifth 
inning off Ryan Rupe (6-5). 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Mesa earned his 23rd save for the host Mariners.  
</P>
<P>
                         *Rangers 9, Twins 5    	
</P>
<P>
	Ivan Rodriguez went 4-for-5 with three runs scored to keep up  
his torrid pace as Texas remained unbeaten in nine games against 
Minnesota this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez singled in the first, second, sixth and eighth  
innings, and is 19-for-28 in his last six games. Juan Gonzalez went 
2-for-4 with three RBIs to help the Rangers to their fifth victory 
in their last six games. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Morgan (12-6) got the win and Benj Sampson (3-2) took the  
loss for the visiting Twins. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Athletics 12, Orioles 2    	
</P>
<P>
	Matt Stairs and Miguel Tejada hit three-run homers, the third  
straight game each had homered, as Oakland won its fifth straight. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Tim Hudson (6-1) pitched seven solid innings for Oakland,  
which won its eighth straight at home to remain 2 1/2 games behind 
Toronto and pull within a game of Boston in the wild-card race. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Bones (0-3) took the loss.  
</P>
<P>
                         *Royals 7, Angels 0    	
</P>
<P>
	At Anaheim, Jeff Suppan (6-6) pitched a five-hitter for his  
first major league shutout and Kansas City blanked the opposition 
for the first time in more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Royals became the last team in the majors to have a shutout  
this season and had their first since June 22, 1998 against 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Fyhrie (0-3) took the loss.  
</P>
<P>
                        *White Sox 9, Tigers 6    	
</P>
<P>
	Craig Wilson and Chris Singleton hit two-run homers as Chicago  
swept the two-game series at Detroit and sent the Tigers to their 
eighth straight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Singleton was 4-for-5 with three RBIs and Ray Durham had three  
hits for the White Sox, who have won three straight and five of 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
	John Snyder (9-6) gave up five runs -- three earned -- and six  
hits in five innings, and Bob Howry earned his 18th save.

<HEADLINE> Filmmaker Makes 'Blair Witch' Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The makers of the ``The Blair Witch  
Project'' have been sued by a man who says he was cheated out of 
credit for the film and deserves some of the millions earned by the 
hit movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Barber, an Orlando filmmaker, said that his company paid for  
much of the movie's preproduction costs and that he should have 
been listed as a producer or executive producer in the credits. He 
also claims that director Dan Myrick and Myrick's girlfriend broke 
into his office and took documents, a master copy of the film and 
other tapes. 
</P>
<P>
	Barber is suing Myrick -- one of the film's two directors --  
Myrick's girlfriend, Kristal Jordan, and producer Greg Hale. 
</P>
<P>
	John Marshall Oden, an attorney for all three defendants, denied  
the theft allegation and called the lawsuit an attempt at 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	Barber filed his lawsuit in June 1998, long before ``Blair  
Witch'' became one of this summer's biggest surprises. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie has made more than $36 million. Barber is seeking a  
percentage of the movie's gross -- and he claims the percentage 
eventually could be worth at least $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants have filed a countersuit against Barber, alleging  
he tried to interfere with their agreement with Artisan 
Entertainment, the film's distributor, by seeking an injunction in 
California to stop the movie's release. The injunction was denied. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blair Witch'' purports to be the story of three college-age  
filmmakers who disappear in the Maryland woods while trying to make 
a documentary on the legendary Blair Witch. Five University of 
Central Florida graduates spent $60,000 to shoot the film.

<HEADLINE> Falcons' McDaniels Unique Off Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- For Pellom McDaniels, football is merely  
a starting point for discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Very quickly, the conversation shifts away from zone blitzes and  
blocking schemes to very un-football-like passions such as writing, 
painting and poetry. 
</P>
<P>
	McDaniels is not just a defensive end for the Atlanta Falcons.  
He's an artist and entrepreneur, inventor and philosopher, civic 
crusader and willing role model, dreamer and renaissance man. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once I finally made it to the NFL, I knew if I put my mind to  
something I could do it,'' McDaniels said. ``I started using 
football to get me in a lot of other doors, with my writing, my 
invention and all that other stuff. I just took a chance. I found 
out the worst thing in life that people could tell me was `no.' I 
find out the reasons they say no, then turn around and use it to my 
advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's written two books, with a third on the way. ``My Own  
Harlem'' offers poetic musings and deeply personal thoughts of a 
complex young man in search of a place for himself and his people. 
``So You Want To Be A Pro?'' shares with young people his views on 
discipline, coping with peer pressure, time management and the 
importance of education. 
</P>
<P>
	There's more.  
</P>
<P>
	McDaniels and his wife, Navvab, launched the ``Arts for Smarts''  
program, which acquaints thousands of disadvantaged kids with 
dance, theater and literature. He owns and operates a clothing 
business. Even something as common as an unpleasant trip to the 
dentist started the wheels spinning: He invented his own flavored 
gel, got it cleared through the Food and Drug Administration and 
put it on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm an eclectic-type person,'' McDaniels said. ``I let myself  
do anything I want to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDaniels, 31, signed with the Falcons after seven years in  
Kansas City, providing the NFC champions with some much-needed 
depth on the defensive line. It's the same role he played with the 
Chiefs, filling in wherever he was needed on a team that featured 
Neil Smith, Derrick Thomas and Chester McGlockton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figured out a long time ago that if you wanted to do  
anything, you have to know more about it than anyone else,'' 
McDaniels said. ``I learned every position to get the job in Kansas 
City. Whenever I was called upon -- whether it was nose guard, left 
end or right end -- I had to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDaniels' work ethic stems from the rejection he felt on draft  
day in 1990, when no team called despite a solid career at Oregon 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was devastating,'' said McDaniels, who earned a degree in  
communications and political science. ``I thought I did everything 
right in college, in athletics and academics, and it just didn't 
pan out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He took a job selling health and beauty care products, but  
football was still in his blood. The following year, he played for 
the World League's Birmingham Fire, earning a tryout from the 
Philadelphia Eagles. Failing to make the team, he returned to 
Birmingham for another season in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, he earned a spot with the Chiefs in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
	``It all stems from not making it,'' McDaniels said. ``I feel  
blessed going to work every day. I don't take it for granted. It's 
a job, but this game has given me a lot. Confidence, for one. 
Self-esteem. A feeling of accomplishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For him, the greatest feeling is discovering an opponent's  
weakness in the film room, then taking advantage of it on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, for instance, he noticed the Steelers ran a sweep  
every time the tight end went in motion to that side of the field. 
During a Monday night game, he seized on that revelation to tackle 
Jerome Bettis in the backfield for a 7-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a great feeling,'' McDaniels said. ``I may not be a  
starter, but when I play I make plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also makes a difference away from the field.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know about all that other stuff until we started  
talking about signing him,'' Falcons coach Dan Reeves said. ``I've 
never had anybody that has their own company, writes books. ... 
It's really intriguing to see all the stuff he's done.''

	The court, in a unanimous decision, sided with James Dale, a  
Matawan assistant scoutmaster who was kicked out of the Boy Scouts 
nine years ago when leaders found out he is gay. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said the Boy Scouts organization constitutes a ``place  
of public accommodation'' because it has a broad-based membership 
and forms partnerships with public entities and public service 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, the court said the Boy Scouts fall under New Jersey's  
anti-discrimination law and cannot deny any person 
``accommodations, advantages, facilities and privileges'' because 
of sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	The court also rejected the Boy Scouts' contention that striking  
down their ban on homosexuals violates the group's First Amendment 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``To recognize the Boy Scouts' First Amendment claim would be  
tantamount to tolerating the expulsion of an individual solely 
because of his status as a homosexual -- an act of discrimination 
unprotected by the First Amendment freedom of speech,'' the 
decision reads. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale, now 29, earned 30 merit badges and various other awards  
and was an Eagle Scout during his 12 years in the organization. He 
was expelled in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	A lower court judge ruled in the Scouts' favor in 1995, calling  
homosexuality ``a serious moral wrong'' and agreeing with the Boy 
Scouts that the group is a private organization and has a 
constitutional right to decide who can belong. 
</P>
<P>
	In overturning that decision last year, an appeals court said  
Dale's ``exemplary journey through the Boy Scouts of America ranks 
as testament enough that these stereotypical notions about 
homosexuals must be rejected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George Davidson, an attorney for the Boy Scouts, said this is  
the first time the group had lost such a case in a state's highest 
court. He had argued the group has a right to pick its own leaders 
without interference from ``an all-powerful state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sad day when the state dictates to parents what role  
models they must provide for their children,'' Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``To us, the silver lining is it gives Boy Scouts the first  
opportunity to go the U.S. Supreme Court and get a definitive 
ruling to put an end to these lawsuits,'' he said 
</P>
<P>
	The court decision rejected ``the notion that Dale's presence in  
the organization is symbolic of Boy Scouts' endorsement of 
homosexuality. ... Dale has never used his leadership position or 
membership to promote homosexuality, or any message inconsistent 
with Boy Scouts' policies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dale scheduled an afternoon news conference at the New York  
offices of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, which 
represented him in court. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great day for our client, but also for both lesbian and  
gay people who want to join the Boy Scouts,'' said Beatrice Dohrn, 
legal director for the group. ``It's also a great day for other 
people in the Boy Scouts who got a message today of inclusion 
rather than one of discrimination.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Deal Cuts Use of Colo. River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- California's three biggest users of Colorado  
River water reached a historic agreement Wednesday intended to end 
the state's decades-old practice of taking more than its share of 
the river. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations were watched closely by Indian tribes, Mexico  
and the six other states that share the Colorado, the lifeblood of 
the booming cities and suburbs of the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the verbal pact were kept secret, but a federal aide  
said its key provision is an agreement to break with generations of 
law and tradition and allow water districts with surplus water to 
transfer their excess to areas that need it more. 
</P>
<P>
	``As water becomes scarcer and scarcer, and growth happens, it's  
important to remove barriers to enable water to go where it need to 
goes,'' said David Hayes, an aide to U.S. Interior Secretary Bruce 
Babbitt. ``That's what has happened here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal involves three parties: the Metropolitan Water District  
of Southern California, a powerful agency that indirectly provides 
water to 16 million people; the Imperial Irrigation District, which 
serves farms in the state's extreme southeast corner; and the 
smaller Coachella Valley Water District serving farmers farther in 
the north. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a multi-state agreement dating to 1922, California is  
allowed to draw 4.4 million acre-feet of water per year from the 
Colorado. An acre-foot is 326,000 gallons, enough to supply two 
families of four for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the federal government has regularly allowed the state  
to take more than its share, sometimes up to 5.2 million acre-feet 
per year, angering other states. 
</P>
<P>
	That was possible partly because the other Colorado River states  
-- Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico -- didn't 
need their full share under the 1922 agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	But the West's population boom has turned up the pressure from  
the other states to rein in California. 
</P>
<P>
	The Imperial Valley Irrigation District uses most of  
California's allotment, irrigating the desert and using what cities 
and environmentalists say are unreasonable amounts of water. 
</P>
<P>
	The current negotiations began when the San Diego County Water  
Authority sought to buy water from Imperial that its farmers 
weren't using. Having no direct way to get the water, San Diego 
proposed taking delivery through the aqueduct system run by the 
Metropolitan Water District. 
</P>
<P>
	Metropolitan initially resisted but eventually agreed to the  
arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a comprehensive solution to everyone's needs,'' said Tom  
Levy, general manager of the Coachella district. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement still needs the approval of water district boards,  
state and federal agencies, Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego County Water Authority spokesman Dennis Cushman called  
the deal a positive step, but noted the many steps remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our experience, it's not done until it's done,'' Cushman  
said.

<HEADLINE> Study: Sunscreen May Lull Users </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Five years ago, Melissa Beaudet joined in a  
walk to end hunger and came home with a blistering sunburn. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since, the 21-year-old Washingtonian has liberally applied  
sunscreen -- nothing lower than a sun-protection factor of 8 -- when 
she's in the sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can see my friends aging, and I know cancer is something you  
can get if you're not careful,'' she said, soaking in the rays at 
Georgetown Swimming Pool in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	But Beaudet's careful approach may not be fully protecting her  
from the threat of cancer after all. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal of the National Cancer Institute reports in today's  
edition that European researchers found that people who use 
stronger sunscreens stay out longer in the sun because it takes 
longer for them to burn. And the prolonged exposure only increases 
their risk of getting skin cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not due to the fact that sunscreens are bad, but people  
have a bad attitude -- using them to increase the amount of time 
they spend in the sun,'' said Dr. Ferdy Lejeune, an author of the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers gave 87 French and Swiss college students  
sunscreen to take on vacation and record their sun habits -- hours 
of exposure, amount of sunscreen applied, clothing and sunburn. 
</P>
<P>
	Half the participants were given sunscreen with a sun-protection  
factor, or SPF, of 30. The other half received SPF 10. But neither 
group knew which product they were using. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who applied SPF 30 stayed outside 25 percent longer,  
spending a majority of that time sunbathing. 
</P>
<P>
	Lejeune said the students often waited until their skin turned  
red before finding shade. Vacationers with the stronger sunscreen 
waited even longer, increasing their exposure to ultraviolet 
radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of being protected, it's just the opposite because  
their behavior is bad,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vivian Clark, 49, of Washington, said she uses common sense when  
applying sunscreen. In years past, when she has sunbathed on her 
row house roof, she has worn an SPF 10 or 12. This year, she's 
found that she can avoid burning if she monitors how much time she 
spends in the sun and wears a lower SPF. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't burned at all,'' she said. ``Maybe I started tanning  
slower or maybe it's the weather. Who knows?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, sometimes she doesn't mind a rosy glow, she admitted.  
</P>
<P>
	Although skin cancer is preventable, the incidence of melanoma  
in the United States increases 4 percent a year, according to the 
National Cancer Institute. Previous research has also shown that 
people who use sunscreen have increased incidence of melanoma and 
other skin cancers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Karen Emmons, a researcher with the Dana-Farber Cancer  
Institute, said the study should not deter people from applying 
sunscreen -- liberally. 
</P>
<P>
	No one should say, ``Oh well, I'm still going to get skin cancer  
so why bother,'' Emmons said. ``It's very important that people use 
sunscreen and apply it appropriately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emmons recommends that in addition to lotions, people should  
avoid direct sunlight by staying in the shade and wearing hats and 
other protective clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study published in December, the same researchers reported  
that of 631 European school children, those using the most 
sunscreen were most likely to have sun-caused moles, a sign that 
skin cancer might develop later in life. While the lotion itself 
did not cause moles, it may have made parents overconfident about 
how long their children could safely play outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
	Children are especially vulnerable to ultraviolet radiation and  
need more than just protective lotions, Emmons said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The No. 1 way that children are protected from the sun is  
using sunscreen,'' she says. ``And parents need to get with the 
program and start using other kinds of protection.''

<HEADLINE> Stolen Mayan Artifact Returned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When archeologist Ian Graham heard last fall  
that a U.S. art collector planned to sell a 1,000-year-old Mayan 
artifact, he thought immediately of the saw marks on the front of a 
limestone monument he discovered in Guatemala in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7 1/2-foot monument of a standing man was missing a rectangular  
section that had once decorated its chest. The one about to be sold 
sounded a lot like the stolen fragment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew that that was the piece,'' said Graham, who works at  
the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	He immediately notified the Guatemalan consulate, which  
announced Wednesday in New York that the piece had been recovered 
and would be returned soon to its Central American homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us, it's an invaluable treasure because it is a part of  
our history,'' said Guatemalan Consul General Fabiola Fuentes 
Orellana. ``It's priceless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham discovered the damaged statue in 1971 in northern  
Guatemala. Where its carved stone chest ornamentation should have 
been, he found just the flat surface left by thieves' saws. The 
chest piece had probably been stolen about five years earlier, 
along with other items, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Guatemalan consulate had its lawyers alert U.S. Customs.  
Howard Spiegler, a lawyer for the Guatemalan government, then spoke 
to the collector, who agreed to return the piece, Spiegler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spiegler would not discuss how the American collector, whom he  
did not identify, had obtained the artifact. Neither he nor Graham 
could estimate the value of the recovered piece.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 88.02; Nasdaq Down 25.40 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks surged higher today on news of  
a $9.3 billion merger of Dow Chemical and Union Carbide, but the 
broader market lagged well behind. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 88.02 at 10,765.33. On Tuesday, the index rose 31.35 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Tuesday's pattern, other market indexes struggled with  
modest losses while the Dow marched higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 
500 index was off 4.49 at 1,317.69, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was down 25.40 at 2,562.59. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's gains came largely from the announcement that Dow  
Chemical is buying Union Carbide, building its position as the No. 
2 chemical company behind DuPont. The two companies said they 
expect the combination to save $500 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Union Carbide, a Dow Jones component stock, soared 10 5/8 to 59  
7/16, while Dow Chemical fell 7 5/16 to 117 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies that make basic materials like chemicals and  
paper rose as well. International Paper, another stock in the Dow 
average, rose 3 1/4 to 55 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, traders remained unconvinced of the market's underlying  
strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is lacking any conviction,'' said Richard Cripps,  
chief market strategist for Legg Mason in Baltimore. ``The market 
lacks any real incentives for buyers to come in, and some selling 
pressure definitely remains.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks continued to languish. Amazon.com fell 4 3/4 to  
90 1/8, and online auctioneer eBay fell 6 1/16 to 78 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices, which have tumbled amid the growing belief that the  
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates, recovered today as the 
Treasury Department said it would reduce bond sales and proposed a 
buyback of the $3.6 trillion national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.11  
percent from 6.16 percent late Tuesday. But analysts say the yield 
remains high enough to lure some investors away from stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were expected to stay in a fairly narrow range through  
Friday, when the Labor Department releases its monthly unemployment 
report. The report is expected to offer the latest indication of 
whether wage pressures are escalating enough to persuade the Fed to 
raise rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly 2-to-1 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 617.71 million 
shares, slightly ahead of Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 3.57 at 618.83, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 2.04 at 778.43. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies slipped 6.04 to  
430.24.

<HEADLINE> Enough Talk, Mrs. Clinton Listens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAMESTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- Slamming the door on further talk of her  
husband's infidelities, Hillary Rodham Clinton returned to the 
Senate campaign trail Wednesday, calling for a big-state coalition 
to fight for more federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, the former first lady of Arkansas, said the larger  
states such as New York, California and Illinois, where she was 
raised, were being shortchanged on federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Were I in the Senate, I would try to create a coalition of the  
big states to stand up for our interests,'' she told more than 60 
Jamestown-area residents at a ``listening event'' at Crawford's 
Furniture factory. ``It may be that we'll never get a 
dollar-for-dollar exchange, but we sure ought to get more than 
we're getting now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's pitch for more federal aid for larger states  
picks up on a theme espoused for years by fellow Democrat Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan, who next year is vacating the Senate seat the 
first lady is eyeing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get more interested in running every day,'' she said  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Republican side, a race is being considered by New York  
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and two House members from Long Island, 
Peter King and Rick Lazio. 
</P>
<P>
	Moynihan has long argued that New York and other large states  
send more to Washington than they get back in federal aid, to the 
tune of $14 billion annually for New York. Smaller states often get 
more money than they send to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said the situation stems from federal policies that  
began more than 50 years ago when ``a state like New York was so 
much better off than a state like Alabama'' and ``there was a 
conscious effort to redistribute money to the poorer states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady said that trend continued, even as the economic  
disparity lessened, because ``you've got a lot of political 
influence in the Congress that represents those (smaller) states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Mrs. Clinton, it was the first appearance on the campaign  
trail in New York since the Talk magazine interview appeared in 
which she discussed her marital problems more openly than ever 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said Wednesday that enough had been said on the subject.  
</P>
<P>
	``I really believe strongly that the country has put that issue  
behind it. I have as well,'' Mrs. Clinton said, adding, ``I've said 
all I'm going to say on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before she clamped the lid down again, Mrs. Clinton said she did  
not mean to imply in the interview that the president's childhood 
problems were to blame for his infidelities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is responsible for their behavior and I am a very  
strong proponent and believer in personal responsibility, so I hope 
that people will take that message away from this,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady also said, ``My husband and I love each other  
very much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Talk magazine interview, Mrs. Clinton called her  
husband's infidelities ``a sin of weakness'' and appeared to 
suggest it might have been linked to battles between his mother and 
grandmother over custody of him when he was young. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the Jamestown event, Mrs. Clinton stopped for lunch in  
Dunkirk on the edge of Lake Erie on her way to Buffalo. She planned 
to spend Thursday in the Buffalo area before ending her latest New 
York foray with stops Friday in Rochester.

<HEADLINE> Lightning, Sharks Swap Five Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The Tampa Bay Lightning traded left wing  
Niklas Sundstrom to the San Jose Sharks on Wednesday in a 
five-player trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay sent Sundstrom and a third round draft pick to San  
Jose for defensemen Andrei Zyuzin and Bill Houlder and left wings 
Shawn Burr and Steve Guolla. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel we are a significantly better team today than we were  
yesterday,'' said Rick Dudley, the Lightning's vice president and 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``Zyuzin is one of the most dynamic young defensemen in the  
league, Houlder immediately fills our need for a veteran 
defenseman, Burr is a proven character player in this league and 
Guolla has shown the ability to become a regular at the NHL 
level,'' Dudley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sundstrom was acquired by the Lightning during the NHL draft in  
June from the New York Rangers along with goaltender Dan Cloutier 
and the Rangers' first- and third-round picks in the 2000 draft. 
The Lightning sent the fourth overall pick in this year's draft to 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers' third-round pick was dealt to San Jose Wednesday  
along with Sundstrom. 
</P>
<P>
	Sundstrom, 24, had 13 goals and 30 assists in 81 games with the  
Rangers last season. He scored 65 goals and had 98 assists in his 
four-year career with New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Zyuzin, 21, was the No. 2 pick in the 1996 NHL draft. The 6-1,  
200-pound Russian has played in 81 combined games the last two 
seasons, scoring nine and adding eight assists. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lightning re-acquired Houlder and Burr from the Sharks. Each  
played the 1995-96 and 1996-97 seasons with Tampa Bay before going 
to San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	Houlder, 32, has played 12 NHL seasons with 50 goals and 153  
assists in 530 games. He led San Jose defensemen in scoring the 
last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	In 874 games, the 33-year-old Burr has 181 goals and 257 assists  
but only had one point in 18 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Guolla, 26, played 64 games over the last three seasons. He  
scored 16 goals and had 11 assists.

<HEADLINE> Sprinter Mitchell Gets Two-Year Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Sprinter Dennis Mitchell, banned from track events for a  
two-year period, will be be eligible to run in the 2000 Sydney 
Olympics because the penalty is retroactive. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell was declared ineligible from April 1, 1998, until March  
31, 2000. Any performances by him during that period are ``null and 
void,'' international track's governing body said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The retroactive ban ends six months before the Sydney Olympics.  
However, Mitchell, the U.S. 100-meter champion, will miss the world 
championships this month in Seville, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Amateur Athletic Federation said his drug test  
from 16 months ago showed high levels of testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF arbitration panel ruled that Mitchell, the 100-meter  
bronze medalist in the 1992 Olympics and two-time bronze medalist 
at the world championships, had no right of appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision is final and binding,'' Giorgio Reineri, a  
spokesman for the IAAF said from the organization's headquarters in 
Monte Carlo, Monaco. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell's lawyer maintained on Tuesday the 33-year-old sprinter  
has never taken testosterone or any other banned substance. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has always been against the use of drugs in track and  
field,'' lawyer Suja Thomas said from New York. ``This is truly a 
severe disappointment to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about Dennis Mitchell and he is an exemplary person,  
and secondarily he is an athlete,'' Thomas said. ``He doesn't want 
this perception and he wants to compete. He should compete because 
he hasn't done anything wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A call to Mitchell in Florida was answered by his wife, who said  
he was not home. Mitchell ran Monday in Malmo, Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	Reineri said he did not consider the ban a light punishment.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is the rule for everybody,'' he said. ``According to our  
constitution, a ban starts the day after the positive doping 
test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A three-member panel of USA Track and Field cleared Mitchell in  
December. The USATF did not release the details of Mitchell's 
defense or the reasons for exonerating him. 
</P>
<P>
	But London's Daily Telegraph reported this year that Mitchell  
won his case on grounds that his positive result stemmed from 
having sex four times and drinking five bottles of beer the night 
before the test. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF arbitrators met July 24-25. The organization said the  
USATF decision in December was ``erroneous.'' Messages left at USA 
Track and Field in Indianapolis were not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas disputed the report that sex and beer contributed to the  
positive drug test.

	``It's much more complicated than that,'' she said, adding that  
a combination of stress and nonbanned substances caused him to fail 
the test that day.

unfortunate it has come to this.''

<HEADLINE> Group Promotes Welfare To Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Welfare to Work Partnership, which has been  
prodding businesses to hire people off welfare for more than two 
years, is turning its attention to the nuts and bolts of helping 
companies make their programs work. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best way we're going to help these businesses now isn't  
motivating them to join us -- that, we've done,'' said Eli Segal, 
the group's president, who formed the partnership at the urging of 
President Clinton, a longtime friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to move from recruitment to service.''  
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the partnership wrapped up a three-day conference,  
which was highlighted by a town hall meeting with Clinton on 
Tuesday. The national meeting capped a series of rallies in cities 
across the country where the partnership urged local companies to 
join, promising to hire at least one person off the welfare rolls. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 12,000 companies have done that, although one-third have  
yet to actually hire anyone, according to a survey done for the 
partnership in February. And about half of the rest had hired fewer 
than six people. Other large companies -- UPS and Burger King, for 
instance -- have hired thousands of welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting more hires, Segal said, will require more practical  
advice. To that end, the group released guides to combating drug 
and transportation problems, and a new Internet site is meant to 
help people connect with groups that can help them. 
</P>
<P>
	But Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, who addressed the conference  
Wednesday, suggested that the cheerleading is still important, 
particularly among small businesses who may not have tried to hire 
off the welfare rolls yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Businesses have gotten the message, but I think you can't take  
that for granted,'' Herman said in an interview. ``This is an area 
where repetition is very, very important. This is a 60-year-old 
system. We're not going to change it in three or four years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, hoping to be more practical, the partnership plans to  
help businesses choose the right outside agency, sometimes called a 
service provider, to train and provide low-income workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Many cities have dozens of these mostly nonprofit groups  
offering such services, but businesses -- particularly small 
businesses -- have trouble figuring out which to use. Some are 
focused heavily on work skills like how to show up on time, while 
others teach practical skills like using computers. Some follow 
their clients for a year; others only work with them until they 
hired. 
</P>
<P>
	The need for such services was supported by preliminary results  
from focus groups convened Monday that included businesses, 
nonprofit groups and welfare recipients, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is the perception that service providers and businesses  
often talk past each other, not to each other,'' said a summary of 
the results made available Wednesday. ``Businesses, particularly 
small ones, don't know where to go or even where to start looking 
for assistance ... with how to implement welfare to work 
programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One small business owner, participating in the focus group, put  
it this way: ``Business is being bombarded with `what I can do for 
you' with no way of sorting through who can provide what and their 
success rate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The focus groups, run by pollsters from Wirthlin Worldwide, also  
found that nearly three years after Clinton signed welfare reform 
into law, businesses are concerned with child care, transportation 
and training -- the same things policy experts were concerned about 
when welfare reform began. 
</P>
<P>
	And they still worry that people coming off the rolls will have  
come from poor schools and unsupportive families and may be 
addicted to drugs or have criminal records or mental illnesses.

<HEADLINE> Musical Estate of Bach's Son Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- More than 50 years after it was lost in the chaos  
of World War II, a trove of music written by Johann Sebastian Bach 
has been discovered in Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
	The music, part of the missing archives of the Berlin  
Sing-Akademie, a still-performing group established in 1791, was 
found in Kiev after a 20-year search by a Harvard music professor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was believed lost. There was absolutely no trace of it for  
well over 50 years,'' Christoph Wolff, who is also dean of the 
Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, said Wednesday. ``For a long 
time, we Bach scholars were led to believe that the material was 
destroyed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolff said the Germans took the Sing-Akademie archive from  
Berlin in 1943 to protect it from the destruction of war. When 
hostilities ended in 1945, it fell into Soviet hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolff had spent the past two decades tracking various leads, but  
his real break came in April when another Harvard researcher found 
a Russian document from the post-war years ``that described the 
existence of 5,000-plus music manuscripts in Kiev.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until June that Wolff located the archive, cut through  
significant red tape and spent three days rooting through the old 
papers at Ukraine's Central State Archive. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really adding a significant new dimension to the study  
of 18th-century music,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The compositions were found among the 5,000 or so documents in  
the Sing-Akademie archives as part of the musical estate of Carl 
Phillipp Emanuel Bach, one of J.S. Bach's sons, himself a 
well-known composer. 
</P>
<P>
	The archive also holds works by some of J.S. Bach's 19 other  
children, as well as a variety of other 18th- and early 
19th-century German composers. It also has letters written by poet 
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolff said he hopes the works may someday be returned to  
Germany, but no decisions have been made about the documents' 
future.

<HEADLINE> Musgrove Wins Gubernatorial Primary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- The Democratic lieutenant governor and a  
Republican ex-congressman won their gubernatorial primaries after 
concentrating on feel-good messages that contrasted with the 
combativeness of outgoing Gov. Kirk Fordice. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Gov. Ronnie Musgrove and Mike Parker will face off in  
November's general election. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker, who spent 10 years in Congress and is a former funeral  
home director, was the big surprise by winning the GOP primary 
outright. He had struggled to gain statewide name recognition and 
was expected to be in a runoff. Instead, he won a six-way race with 
51 percent of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker, 49, and Musgrove, 43, who got 56 percent in the  
eight-way Democratic race, had dodged negative ads from their 
rivals, who tried to paint Musgrove as a tax-and-spend liberal and 
Parker as a do-nothing congressman. Instead, they spent most of 
their time playing up their small-town values. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner in November will replace Fordice, the first GOP  
governor in Mississippi since Reconstruction, who is barred from 
seeking a third term. 
</P>
<P>
	Fordice captured more headlines than the candidates in recent  
weeks when he was caught returning from a French vacation with his 
girlfriend and threatened to beat up a TV reporter who asked him 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after, Fordice announced he planned to divorce his wife of  
44 years and marry the other woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Fordice did not endorse a candidate during the campaign but  
showed up at Parker's victory celebration Tuesday night. He refused 
to talk to journalists.

<HEADLINE> Tax Cut Debate Previews Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the veto clash now taking shape,  
Republicans intend to trumpet the benefits of tax cuts for 
individuals, families, students and others. President Clinton and 
Democrats will talk darkly of a GOP plan that shortchanges 
Medicare, Social Security and other programs Americans hold dear. 
</P>
<P>
	The outcome of their struggle will determine not only the fate  
of tax cuts and other major legislation over the next two months, 
but also help shape the 2000 election campaign that will decide 
control of the White House and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the president will not veto this,'' Texas GOP Rep. Bill  
Archer, the chief House tax-writer, said of the $792 billion 
measure. ``Every income taxpayer in America will get relief in this 
bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton has repeatedly said he will cast a veto, and  
Republicans crafted a final House-Senate compromise designed to 
maximize the political price that he and his Democratic supporters 
will pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Tax rates would come down by 1 percentage point, a reduction  
that means higher proportional cuts for the lowest bracket than the 
highest. The marriage penalty would be eliminated. The 
self-employed would be allowed to deduct the full cost of health 
insurance premiums from their taxes. The cost of education would be 
cut to students who borrow money. Individuals would be permitted to 
contribute more money to tax-deductible retirement accounts. 
Farmers would benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle previewed the  
case Wednesday in opposition. ``I will refuse to sign any plan that 
signs away our commitment to America's future, Social Security, 
Medicare, paying down the debt,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	And Daschle said the measure offered ``the sun and the moon and  
the stars ... for special interests all over the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But if I were a student in school, if I were a senior citizen  
on Medicare looking for prescription drugs, if I were a farmer, if 
I were just about anybody but those few thousand people who are 
going to be beneficiaries of this major rip-off, I would wonder 
whether or not the sun and the moon and the stars will be available 
for them,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders hope to secure final passage for the measure by  
Thursday or Friday. It won't be sent to the White House until after 
Labor Day, though. 
</P>
<P>
	That way, rank-and-file Republicans can spend the August  
congressional recess describing the benefits of the measure to 
their constituents. And Clinton would be deprived of a 
headline-grabbing veto ceremony with GOP lawmakers dispersed and 
unable to respond effectively. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very good for us to take this tax message home,'' said  
Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., the chief deputy whip of House Republicans. 
``If we want to give money back (in tax cuts) as the first priority 
and they want to spend it, that's a good issue for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is a theme that Republicans stress. ``We want to cut taxes  
and the president wants to spend (the surplus),'' Senate Majority 
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said recently. ``That's what the 
fighting is all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rank and file lawmakers will be supplied with material for their  
appearances back home, while Speaker Dennis Hastert and Lott are 
both expected to make appearances in scattered locations around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP message will be that Republicans passed tax cuts only  
after proposing ``lock box'' legislation that sets aside $2 
trillion in projected surpluses to be available for Social Security 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, sometime this fall, after the veto has faded from the  
headlines, Republicans in Congress on the one hand and Clinton on 
the other will have to decide whether to reach across party lines 
and attempt to fashion a compromise that would cover tax cuts, 
Medicare and domestic spending as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Divisions are likely in both camps on that issue.  
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats favor passage of a middle-ground tax cut. Others  
can be expected to oppose compromise, believing it would only help 
the image of House Republicans. But they are already nervous that 
Clinton will decide to work with the GOP, as he did on welfare 
reform in 1996 and the balanced budget agreement of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Republicans, some prefer to let the issue ride through  
the 2000 elections, confident it will give their presidential 
nominee and congressional candidates a winning hand. Others, 
principally in the House, prefer accomplishment over gridlock to 
show they can govern effectively. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a judgment question,'' says Rep. Tom Davis, the Virginia  
Republican who chairs the GOP campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The fate of the GOP majority may turn on the answer.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Guilty Plea in Olympic Bid Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A Salt Lake City businessman pleaded  
guilty to a misdemeanor tax charge and agreed to aid the 
government's investigation after the Justice Department brought its 
first criminal charges relating to the Olympic bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	David E. Simmons, who ran the now-defunct Keystone  
Communications, admitted Tuesday to hiring the son of one of the 
International Olympic Committee's most powerful members for a bogus 
job and hiding the source of his salary, which was paid by Salt 
Lake City's Olympic bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first criminal case to result from a federal  
investigation into gifts, favors, cash payments, medical care and 
jobs lavished on IOC members and their relatives by Salt Lake's 
Olympic bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons, appearing Tuesday before U.S. Magistrate Ronald Boyce,  
admitted he illegally deducted as a business expense the salary of 
John Kim, the son of South Korean IOC member Kim Un-yong. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew in fact the purported salary was not genuine, but paid  
under a sham,'' Simmons told Boyce. ``The expense was taken as a 
business deduction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to court documents, Simmons hired John Kim ``for the  
purpose of influencing his father's vote in favor of awarding the 
Olympic Winter Games to Salt Lake City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim was on the Keystone payroll as marketing manager for Asian  
operations from October 1990 to October 1992, but didn't bring any 
business to the company and eventually stopped showing up for work, 
federal documents say. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement earlier Tuesday, Simmons contended he was doing  
the bidding of Tom Welch, former president of the Salt Lake City 
bid committee and later of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee until 
he was forced to resign in the wake of spouse abuse charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch arranged -- and misrepresented -- the deal that would help  
John Kim obtain permanent U.S. residency, Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch's attorney, Tom Schaffer, insisted that Simmons acted on  
his own when he hired Kim and illegally deducted his salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding the possibility that Welch will be indicted, Schaffer  
said, ``I fail to see how Welch or (the bid committee) can be 
incriminated for doing what they were hired to do -- gain influence 
with the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Graff, a New York lawyer for the Kim family, said the  
arrangements for reimbursing Simmons were kept secret from the 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is indeed unfortunate that by implication, Dr. Kim has once  
again been dragged into a story concerning the alleged misdeeds of 
others,'' Graff said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's own investigation in March gave Kim Un-yong a ``severe  
warning'' for his conduct, but stopped short of harsher sanctions 
in the inquiry that led to an unprecedented 10 expulsions or 
resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	Family spokesman Bill Schechter said the younger Kim acted as a  
``rainmaker'' for Keystone Communications, introducing Simmons to 
the CEOs of Korea's major television networks on possible cable-TV 
deals. 
</P>
<P>
	According to court documents, Simmons hired Kim at $50,000, then  
raised the salary to $70,383, and was reimbursed by the bid 
committee and a small contribution from Morris Travel Inc. of Salt 
Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Slack, president of the travel agency, didn't return a call  
asking for an explanation of its $13,216 contribution that Simmons 
considered partial repayment for Kim's salary, a payment made at 
the request of the bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	John MacAloon of the University of Chicago, a member of the  
IOC's new reform panel, said the revelations in Simmons' plea 
agreement make it ``even more implausible'' that Kim Un-yong was 
unaware the Salt Lake boosters were paying his son's salary, but he 
did not expect the IOC to reopen its investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of the (IOC) members, I've talked to, no one doubts the facts  
of the case. The sole issue is being able to prove that the senior 
Kim knew all about this,'' MacAloon told The Salt Lake Tribune, 
which quoted him in a copyright story. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC distanced itself from the predecessor bid committee.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are a different organization with a different mission from  
the former bid committee,'' SLOC Vice President Shelly Thomas said 
in a prepared statement. ``We have cooperated in this investigation 
and await its complete resolution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Leavitt expressed sadness for the state tarnished by  
the lingering scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the difficult aftermath of a painful experience for  
our state,'' Leavitt said. ``My deepest desire is for this to be 
resolved for our entire community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons was released without bail until his sentencing on a  
charge that carries a maximum penalty of a year in prison and a 
$100,000 fine. Justice Department attorneys will recommend a 
lenient sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sincerely regret and accept full responsibility for my  
participation in acts taken at the request of Welch and Kim,'' 
Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said the charge  
against Simmons was only the first ``arising out of an ongoing 
investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The probe began last December and has grown to include the  
Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Customs Service.

<HEADLINE>  Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed lower  
Wednesday, led by a fall in Tokyo, the region's largest market. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, stock prices fell on continued investor concern that  
the Japanese yen's strength against the U.S. dollar will hurt 
Japanese exporters, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 284.55 points,  
or 1.58 percent, to close at 17,685.38. On Tuesday, the average 
finished up 144.23 points, or 0.81 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen makes Japanese exports more expensive abroad and  
thus less competitive, and reduces the dollar-denominated earnings 
of Japanese exporters when translated into yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.10 yen at late-afternoon, down 0.30 yen  
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level 
of 115.28 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysian shares plunged 3.8 percent on programmed selling by  
foreign investors, traders said. The Composite Index, which tracks 
100 blue-chip stocks, lost 28.82 points to end at 719.52. 
</P>
<P>
	News that the prominent head of stock broker firm TA Securities  
was arrested and charged earlier in the day in Malaysia's session 
court under the country's Securities Industries Act poured more 
cold water on trading sentiment 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, gains in top banking stocks pushed Hong Kong  
stocks higher for their fourth straight day of gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index ended up 117.18 points, 0.9  
percent, at 13,591.02. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan shares ended lower as concerns over tensions with  
mainland China continued to weigh heavily on investor sentiment. 
The market's key Weighted Price Index closed 64.39 points or 0.9 
percent lower at 7,110.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed virtually unchanged. The Straits  
Times Index gained a marginal 0.63 point to end at 2,144.00. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine stocks rose as a slew of corporate rumors  
whetted the appetites of local investors for a number of issues. 
The 30-company Philippine Stock Exchange Index closed 15.92 points, 
or 0.7 percent, higher at 2,372.05. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed higher on expectations Daewoo Group's  
restructuring will hasten. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index 
gained 2.12 points, or 0.2 percent, to end at 975.45. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian shares closed lower with many potential  
investors sitting on the sidelines amid concerns that U.S. interest 
rates will rise later this month. The All Ordinaries Index closed 
down 26.5 points, or 0.9 percent, at 3,005.7. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed virtually unchanged.  
The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index shed 1.68 points to 2,178.43. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai stock prices closed lower as investors sold  
banking and finance shares. The Stock Exchange of Thailand index 
shed 4.64 points, or 1.0 percent, to close at 451.43. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares fell on a technical correction after  
a sharp rise Tuesday. The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Use Spanish To Get Votes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush studied Spanish in high  
school and college. Al Gore picked it up at age 16, when he spent a 
summer in Mexico. Though neither considers himself fluent, each is 
taking advantage of the Spanish he does know in campaigning for the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	When addressing Hispanic audiences, each sprinkles some Spanish  
into his campaign remarks. Their campaign sites on the World Wide 
Web have ``En Espanol'' versions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush and Gore campaigns say the candidates use Spanish to  
show respect for the Hispanic culture. 
</P>
<P>
	But Iris Rodriguez, a 22-year-old studying to be a bilingual  
education teacher, says speaking the language is not enough. 
</P>
<P>
	She hopes it's not just a campaign stunt, that the two really  
are paying attention to matters important to Hispanics, such as 
education, health care, crime and immigration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I think that they're just doing it for the votes and  
that they're going to forget after,'' said Rodriguez, who attends 
the University of Texas-El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
	Hispanics are America's fastest-growing electorate, currently  
comprising 5 percent of the voting public. California, Texas, New 
York and Florida, all with heavy Hispanic populations, together 
hold 144 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more fluent they can be, the better,'' said Bruce  
Buchanan, a political scientist at the University of Texas-Austin. 
``But even assuming complete fluency, unless it's backed up by a 
record of action or a demonstration of support by embracing policy 
positions important to Hispanics, it's going to have a relatively 
minor impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Buchanan: ``I've heard many Hispanic leaders say, for  
example, `You've got to do more than just sweet-talk for me. You've 
got to deliver for me.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and Gore aren't alone in inserting some Spanish into  
campaign speeches. Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander threw in a 
bit in a speech to adult students in Los Angeles, then had to admit 
he couldn't understand the questions in Spanish that followed. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire, who abandoned a bid for the GOP  
presidential nomination to run as an independent, also speaks at 
least conversational Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're walking a thin line there between showing a commitment  
on the one hand, and being patronizing on the other, and I think 
that's a line that can be quickly crossed,'' said Jerry Polinard, a 
political science professor at the University of Texas-Pan 
American. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the Republican presidential front-runner, is trying to  
rally Hispanics across the country the way he did in Texas, where 
he won the gubernatorial race last year with at least 39 percent of 
the Hispanic vote and perhaps as much as 49 percent. He even 
carried heavily Hispanic Democratic strongholds such as El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the past two presidential elections, the country's  
Hispanic vote has gone overwhelmingly to the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush angered Hispanics last month when he declined to speak to  
the National Council of La Raza, a Latino advocacy group, at its 
convention in Houston. He also declined to address a meeting of 
thousands of minority journalists in Seattle, even though he was 
campaigning in the city at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore addressed both groups.  
</P>
<P>
	What strikes La Raza's Cecilia Munoz most about hearing  
candidates speak Spanish is the contrast in the way Hispanics are 
being treated now compared with the past. Only five years ago, 
California voters passed Proposition 187, which attempted to deny 
medical and educational benefits to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just five years ago, attacking Latinos being the politically  
popular thing to do, to campaigning for the Latino vote in Spanish 
-- that's the statement here,'' said Munoz, La Raza's vice president 
for policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Marine Lt. Col. Junior Ortiz, of Washington, hasn't yet  
decided his candidate for president in 2000, one thing he knows for 
sure: There can be nothing negative about Bush and Gore speaking 
Spanish to Hispanic crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you go to a different country, like Japan or something like  
that, and you try to use some of the words, even if it's just to 
say hello or goodbye, the reception usually is a lot better,'' said 
Ortiz. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't look at it as an insult, but they look at it as:  
`This guy really took the time to at least approach me in my 
language.'''

<HEADLINE> Miami Heat Signs Otis Thorpe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Otis Thorpe, the 16th player in NBA history with  
15,000 points and 10,000 rebounds, signed a contract with the Miami 
Heat on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thorpe, a free agent, averaged 11.3 points and 6.8 rebounds in  
49 games last season with the Washington Wizards. 
</P>
<P>
	``By acquiring Otis Thorpe, we have taken care of our first  
priority by fortifying our front line,'' Heat coach Pat Riley said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, our rebounding was one of the primary reasons we  
did not advance. We had to rectify it. In Otis Thorpe, we have a 
quality power forward-center who can rebound, defend and score,'' 
Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-10 Thorpe played on the 1994 NBA champion Houston  
Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Over a 15-year NBA career, Thorpe's has averaged 14.9 points and  
8.7 rebounds during stops with Sacramento, Houston, Portland, 
Detroit, Vancouver and Washington.

<HEADLINE> One Million Fire Sprinklers Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As many as a million fire sprinklers were  
recalled today by the Consumer Product Safety Commission because 
they may fail to work. 
</P>
<P>
	The sprinklers were installed in nursing homes, hospitals,  
schools and other buildings nationwide from 1961 to 1976. Mealane 
Corp., formerly Star Sprinkler Co. of Philadelphia, has agreed to 
replace the sprinkler heads, the piece responsible for the 
malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission discovered the defect in an ongoing  
fire-sprinkler investigation. During tests, 67 percent of those 
sampled failed to activate properly, said commission spokesman Ken 
Giles. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries have been reported, but the sprinklers allegedly  
failed during a 1991 fire at a Warsaw, Ind., nursing home, Giles 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its investigation, the commission in October recalled  
more than 8 million sprinklers made by Omega, the second-largest 
manufacturer of the devices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know if there is a problem, but we are checking and  
investigating other brands,'' Giles said. 
</P>
<P>
	The recalled Star sprinklers are dry-type model numbers D-1,  
RD-1, RE-1, E-1 and ME-1. Owners should call (800) 866-7807 for 
more information on the recall.

<HEADLINE> Stottlemyre Throws Well in Tuscon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Todd Stottlemyre had a strong outing in his first  
rehabilitation appearance in a game Wednesday and remains on target 
for a return to the Arizona Diamondbacks rotation on Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``My arm feels great,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre, attempting to come back from a partial tear of his  
rotator cuff, threw four shutout innings in Tucson for the 
Diamondbacks' team in the Arizona Rookie League. He allowed three 
hits, struck out five and walked one. Of his 58 pitches, 40 were 
strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``His stuff is as good or better than it was before he was  
hurt,'' said pitching coach Mark Connor, who marveled at how 
quickly Stottlemyre has been able to come back from the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre said he had a restless night and was up at 5 a.m. to  
prepare for the 10 a.m. appearance against the Mexican All-Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his biggest jolt came a half-hour before the first pitch  
when players from the opposing team approached him with cameras and 
baseballs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The opposing team wanted to take pictures with me and have me  
sign baseballs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre, injured while pitching against the San Francisco  
Giants on May 17, refused to undergo surgery because he wanted to 
try to come back this season. He has worked extensively on weights 
and exercises under the supervision of the team's trainers to 
improve the strength around the tear. In the process, he said, 
``I'm stronger than I've ever been in my career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre said his competitive juices were flowing after he  
had a runner on first and second with one out. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like, `Jeez, I don't want to go back to Phoenix giving  
up a couple of runs,''' he said. ``So the last couple of hitters, I 
geared it up a little bit. Especially that last hitter, I really 
went maximum effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be able to do that, to reach back and get a little extra  
and make the pitches and do it pain-free, was nice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre is to make two more starts in the minor leagues,  
next Monday again in the Arizona Rookie League, then five days 
later for a team yet to be determined. He plans to be up to 90 to 
95 pitches by his last rehabilitation start. 
</P>
<P>
	He said there was a time in the first weeks after the injury  
that he wondered if he'd ever pitch again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really for the first time in my career, it was almost like I  
had one foot out of the game,'' Stottlemyre said. ``I was scared 
that maybe it would be over. But for some reason, I feel good 
again.''

<HEADLINE> Titans' Lyons Likely Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The odds of defensive end Pratt Lyons  
playing this season are ``very, very slim'' following a car 
accident that broke a bone in his neck, Tennessee Titans coach Jeff 
Fisher said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons was speeding on a curvy road Tuesday night when he lost  
control of his car and crashed down the embankment and into trees. 
Fisher said the collision threw the 6-foot-5, 295-pound Lyons 
through the windshield. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good Lord was kind to us,'' Dr. Burton Elrod said. ``Pratt  
was very fortunate. Anything in the neck is a game of millimeters. 
But there was no neurological injury. No signs of swelling in the 
spinal cord.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elrod said Lyons experienced no paralysis and could be released  
from the hospital within days. Tests continued Wednesday night, and 
he was listed in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons apparently was knocked unconscious by the collision but  
later walked back up to the road and flagged down a passing 
motorist. He felt well enough that he used a flashlight to retrieve 
his cell phone and playbook from his car before being taken to 
Baptist Hospital by ambulance, Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police reports listed excessive speed as the cause of the crash,  
but no citations will be issued, the department said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons started 12 games at left end in 1998 and was competing  
with top draft pick Jevon Kearse for playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to go on and pick up the slack,'' Fisher  
said. ``He will be missed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teammates declined to comment on Lyons' condition after  
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons had been staying with most of the team in a hotel across  
the road from the practice facility. But he took a drive after team 
meetings, and Fisher said the accident happened about an hour 
before the 11:30 p.m. curfew. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors originally thought the injury was limited to cuts and  
bruises. But the broken bone was found after the 24-year-old end 
reported stiffness in his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Lyons needs surgery will depend on how the bone heals.  
Elrod said fusing the bone to another vertebra is always an option 
but that Lyons should be able to return to football. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons reported to training camp 15 pounds lighter, and Fisher  
said he had been playing ``head and shoulders'' above last season 
when he had two sacks and 47 tackles, including 13 quarterback 
pressures.

<HEADLINE> 'Senator Springer' Frightens Some </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- There's a joke going around about how Ohio  
Democrats could find a rich and famous candidate for U.S. Senate: 
Jerry Springer might throw his chair into the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everybody's laughing.  
</P>
<P>
	Springer, 55, has said he'll consider running as a Democratic  
challenger to Sen. Mike DeWine, who is seeking re-election next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing I thought when I heard his name proposed was,  
`Are these guys nuts? Are they totally insane?''' Jim Schifrin, who 
publishes an independent political newsletter called The 
Whistleblower, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer is a former two-term mayor of Cincinnati who ran for  
governor in 1982, then embarked on a TV career, working as an 
anchor and commentator before discovering that brawling, 
chair-throwing freaks and geeks could make him the nation's No. 
2-rated daytime talk show host. 
</P>
<P>
	DeWine is a former prosecutor whose low-key earnestness led  
colleagues to choose him to preside over Monica Lewinsky's 
deposition in President Clinton's impeachment trial. Messy affairs 
like that are mainstays of ``The Jerry Springer Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeWine has not commented on Springer, but the state's Republican  
chairman, Bob Bennett, has been brandishing jabs like, ``Was Howard 
Stern busy?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schifrin put out a Top 10 list of reasons for a Springer  
candidacy, with entries such as No. 9, ``He's promised to stop 
paying prostitutes with checks.'' Springer did that once as a young 
councilman in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of a Senate run surfaced July 20 in The Plain Dealer of  
Cleveland. Springer's hometown pal in Cincinnati, Hamilton County 
Democratic Party Chairman Tim Burke, told the newspaper the 
talk-show host would be a ``viable, fascinating, interesting 
candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Wrong, wrong and wrong,'' the Plain Dealer editorialized the  
next day. A spasm of righteousness rippled across the state. An 
editorial in The Vindicator of Youngstown called Springer 
``ringmaster of the nation's sleaziest circus.'' Toledo Mayor Carty 
Finkbeiner said Springer would get in the way of his party's 
emphasis on ``family values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Springer put out a statement saying: ``I'm obviously flattered  
and honored by the interest. It's just that at this time I don't 
know whether it's practical or possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Springer said he's giving the Senate race serious consideration  
and will decide by Labor Day. The filing deadline is not until Jan. 
7, but to put on a campaign, Springer would have to deal with 
residency -- he lives in Chicago -- and figure out what to do with 
the syndicated show that has earned him millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer left the country for a vacation late last month after  
his show went on hiatus, and was not available to comment further, 
his publicist Linda Shaffron said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio Democratic chairman David Leland said the party executive  
committee would decide later this year whether to endorse a 
candidate. Columbus lawyer Richard Cordray, the party's 
unsuccessful candidate for state attorney general last year, is 
seeking that backing. 
</P>
<P>
	Leland said he hadn't heard from Springer, but if he does he'll  
tell him that people across the state have strong feelings about a 
possible candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people who are incensed about the fact that he would  
do this,'' Leland said. ``They think it would not be a good 
thing,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Leland said, some people are volunteering to help  
Springer, others think he has no chance, and yet a third group is 
scared he'd win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he would be a great senator,'' said Carol Batis, 43,  
of Cincinnati, who watches Springer's show every day. ``I think 
he's a real good person. He tries to help people on his show and 
help solve their problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karee Dowell, 20, said she had developed a lesser opinion of  
Springer from the few times she's seen his show. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can barely keep his show under control,'' she said. ``He  
doesn't need to be in government.''

<HEADLINE> Dixon Edwards Leaves Dolphins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Doctors say Dixon Edwards can play football.  
He says he can't. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards, a veteran of 18 playoff games and two Super Bowls, left  
the Miami Dolphins on Wednesday and may sit out the season because 
of an irregular heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old linebacker was aware of the problem last year,  
when he started 14 games for the Minnesota Vikings. He participated 
in Miami's first three training camp workouts last week, then 
underwent further tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has seen four different doctors and cardiologists, one in  
Dallas in February and three other doctors in South Florida,'' 
coach Jimmy Johnson said. ``All four have cleared him to practice 
and to play. All four have said he's got a healthy heart. For that 
reason, we're leaving the door open for him to return to the squad 
at a later date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive coordinator George Hill said Edwards' return is a long  
shot. The Dolphins released him and terminated his contract, and 
Edwards returned the $350,000 signing bonus he received for joining 
Miami in June as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt like he would come in here and contribute,'' Hill  
said. ``It's a terrible shame, and I hope the best for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drafted by Johnson and the Dallas Cowboys in 1991, Edwards has  
been a starter since 1993. He spent the past three seasons with the 
Vikings, and his tackle totals declined from 122 in 1996 to 56 in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota released him after last season. The Dolphins, looking  
to further strengthen a defense that allowed the fewest points in 
the NFL last year, signed Edwards to a one-year, $750,000 contract. 
</P>
<P>
	He met Wednesday morning with Johnson before leaving camp.  
</P>
<P>
	``He has concerns,'' Johnson said. ``He'll be working with a  
nutritionist to try to alleviate his concerns, and so he could have 
a change of mind here at a later date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards was expected to challenge two-year starter Derrick  
Rodgers at outside linebacker. Rodgers' productivity fell off 
sharply last year, to 56 tackles and 2 1/2 sacks from 91 tackles and 
five sacks as a rookie in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was my job to lose,'' Rodgers said. ``I'm still competing  
against myself. If no one is around to push me, am I going to 
slough off? No.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even if Rodgers regains his rookie form, the Dolphins now  
have little depth at linebacker behind him and the other starters, 
Robert Jones and Zach Thomas. O.J. Brigance and Sammie Burroughs 
are sidelined with back injuries, and Anthony Harris underwent 
groin surgery Tuesday that will sideline him for at least 10 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards cleared out his locker and checked out of his hotel room  
without talking to teammates or reporters. His agent didn't return 
phone calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who played with Edwards on two Super Bowl championship  
teams, shook his head in reaction to the sudden departure of his 
fellow linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
	``The day he decided not to practice, I knew something was  
seriously wrong, because he's not the type of guy to quit,'' Jones 
said. ``He can play through pain. But you've only got one heart.''

<HEADLINE>  Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed lower  
Wednesday, led by a fall in Tokyo, the region's largest market. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, stock prices fell on continued investor concern that  
the Japanese yen's strength against the U.S. dollar will hurt 
Japanese exporters, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 284.55 points,  
or 1.58 percent, to close at 17,685.38. On Tuesday, the average 
finished up 144.23 points, or 0.81 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen makes Japanese exports more expensive abroad and  
thus less competitive, and reduces the dollar-denominated earnings 
of Japanese exporters when translated into yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.10 yen at late-afternoon, down 0.30 yen  
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level 
of 115.28 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysian shares plunged 3.8 percent on programmed selling by  
foreign investors, traders said. The Composite Index, which tracks 
100 blue-chip stocks, lost 28.82 points to end at 719.52. 
</P>
<P>
	News that the prominent head of stock broker firm TA Securities  
was arrested and charged earlier in the day in Malaysia's session 
court under the country's Securities Industries Act poured more 
cold water on trading sentiment 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, gains in top banking stocks pushed Hong Kong  
stocks higher for their fourth straight day of gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index ended up 117.18 points, 0.9  
percent, at 13,591.02. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan shares ended lower as concerns over tensions with  
mainland China continued to weigh heavily on investor sentiment. 
The market's key Weighted Price Index closed 64.39 points or 0.9 
percent lower at 7,110.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed virtually unchanged. The Straits  
Times Index gained a marginal 0.63 point to end at 2,144.00. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine stocks rose as a slew of corporate rumors  
whetted the appetites of local investors for a number of issues. 
The 30-company Philippine Stock Exchange Index closed 15.92 points, 
or 0.7 percent, higher at 2,372.05. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed higher on expectations Daewoo Group's  
restructuring will hasten. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index 
gained 2.12 points, or 0.2 percent, to end at 975.45. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian shares closed lower with many potential  
investors sitting on the sidelines amid concerns that U.S. interest 
rates will rise later this month. The All Ordinaries Index closed 
down 26.5 points, or 0.9 percent, at 3,005.7. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed virtually unchanged.  
The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index shed 1.68 points to 2,178.43. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Buccaneers, Punter Royals Reunite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Punter Mark Royals signed with the Tampa Bay  
Buccaneers on Wednesday, rejoining the team he left seven years ago 
as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Royals, 34, led the NFC with a 45.6-yard average on 88 punts for  
New Orleans last season. He played two seasons with the Bucs from 
1990-91 before spending the next seven with the Saints, Pittsburgh 
Steelers and Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11th-year pro has a 42.5-yard career average and will  
compete in training camp with rookie Aron Langley and Eddie Howard, 
who punted in two games for the San Francisco 49ers last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Royals, who makes his offseason home in Tampa, joined the team  
before the second practice of the day. The job he's trying to win 
was held last year by Tommy Barnhardt, the player who replaced 
Royals in New Orleans after last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucs, in the market for an experienced punter, worked out  
Royals, John Kidd, Tommy Hutton, Tommy Thompson and Greg Montgomery 
on July 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, first-round draft pick Anthony McFarland practiced  
for the first time since signing a five-year contract worth up to 
$8.5 million. He agreed to terms Tuesday, ending a three-day 
holdout. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can think you're in great shape, but you put the pads on  
and they tell you something else,'' McFarland said. ``It was good 
to get out there, run around a little bit and get some contact. It 
lets you know where you stand.''

<HEADLINE> House To Vote on Inventors' Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House is nearing a vote on legislation  
aimed at protecting the rights of inventors while bringing patent 
procedures more in line with international practices. Opponents say 
it could make small-scale inventors vulnerable to big corporations 
and foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation guarantees 17 years of patent protection after  
the Patent and Trademark Office has granted a patent. It requires 
publication of a patent application after 18 months, conforming to 
practices in Europe and Japan, but allows an inventor to stop 
publication if applying only in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, its chief sponsor, Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., said in  
debate Tuesday night, would ``bring our patent and trademark system 
into the 21st century to the benefit of American inventors and 
American consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coble's bill was modified considerably from legislation that  
narrowly passed the House two years ago but was stalled in the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., the most vocal opponent two  
years ago, said he strongly supports the new bill because it would 
better protect inventors from those who would take advantage of 
early publication to steal their secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the compromise plan ``a major victory for the  
independent inventor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Phyllis Schlafly of the conservative Eagle Forum, long an  
opponent of the legislation, said that even with the changes the 
bill would result in big corporations and foreign companies 
stealing the inventions of individual inventors. 
</P>
<P>
	Publication of applications, she said, was sought by  
multinational corporations ``that want to control all innovation 
and therefore look upon independent inventors as their natural 
enemies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would protect inventors from disreputable invention  
promoters who overcharge to help get patents processed and 
guarantee 17 years of protection after a patent is granted. The 
previous bill called for 20 years after application, which could 
have shortened protection time because the Patent and Trademark 
Office sometimes takes more than three years to process an 
application. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would provide a limited defense to a charge of  
patent infringement for an earlier inventor who has made good-faith 
commercial use of an invention patented by another. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also aims, through early publication, to counter the  
practice of ``submarining,'' in which people delay action on their 
patent applications and then file huge lawsuits against 
competitors, who, not knowing a patent is on file, come out with 
similar products. 
</P>
<P>
	Coble and others argued that the 18-month provision would help  
small-scale inventors by letting investors know what is being 
developed and encouraging them to bring the new products to market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate has yet to consider the legislation.  
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1907.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 5 in Early Trading / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average is up five  
points in today's early going. Advancers and decliners are evenly 
mixed on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is up three points and the S&AMP;P 500  
Index is up less than a point. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index is down 9.6 percent from the record  
high it set July 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street typically defines a correction as a decline of ten  
percent or more, so the tech-heavy Nasdaq is almost there. 
</P>
<P>
	Some market analysts say it's unlikely the market will turn  
around with vigor any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because the market remains focused on the interest rate  
outlook, with the Fed scheduled to discuss rates later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow should get a boost thanks to a merger involving one of  
its component stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Union Carbide is being purchased by Dow Chemical.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Newspaper Carrier Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAULT STE. MARIE, Mich. (AP) -- A former newspaper carrier who  
gunned down an executive at his old paper apologized to his 
victim's family before a judge sentenced him to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathan Hanna, 40, was convicted of killing Anthony Gillespie at  
The Evening News of Sault Ste. Marie with two shotgun blasts on 
July 23, 1998. Hanna's attorney said he was insane and believed 
Gillespie, 48, was the Antichrist. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury rejected Hanna's plea of innocent by reason of insanity  
in June. It found him guilty of murder but mentally ill, which 
amounts to a recommendation that he get treatment in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to say I'm sorry to the Gillespie family. I regret  
there is nothing that can be changed,'' Hanna said Tuesday before 
the sentence was read. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Nicholas Lambros denied a defense motion to set aside the  
jury verdict. Lambros also tacked on two years for a firearms 
violation. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Elizabeth Church said the case would be  
appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauren Rubin, who is engaged to Gillespie's son, sobbed as she  
read a statement on behalf of the family. She recalled Gillespie's 
joy at learning of the planned marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dad was looking forward to so much -- our wedding, being a  
grandfather, growing old with the love of his life, his wife,'' Ms. 
Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nathan Hanna murdered our dad. He murdered our family. He  
murdered our faith in humanity. He murdered our future. He murdered 
our happiness. One evil man has taken away so much,'' she said. 
``This murderer must not be given the opportunity to strike 
again.''

<HEADLINE> Broncos' McCaffrey Gets 5-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Pro Bowl wide receiver Ed McCaffrey signed a  
five-year contract extension with the Denver Broncos on Wednesday 
night which puts him among the 20 highest paid receivers in the 
NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal were not announced.  
</P>
<P>
	The club said the extension, coupled with the two years  
remaining on his previous contract, should ensure that the 
eight-year veteran will end his career with the two-time defending 
Super Bowl champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, McCaffrey caught a career-high 64 passes for 1,053  
yards and 10 touchdowns and made the Pro Bowl for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey was a third-round draft pick by the New York Giants in  
1991, was traded to San Francisco in 1994 and obtained by the 
Broncos in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Down Against Yen, Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen and the euro in  
New York Wednesday as a shaky stock market and strong economic data 
weighed heavily on the currency. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0771, up  
from $1.0676 late Tuesday. The dollar also was quoted at 114.29 
Japanese yen, down from 115.28. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks ended lower Wednesday despite an early rally, and data on  
U.S. factory orders came in stronger than many expected, prompting 
new worries that the Fed may raise interest rates to cool off the 
economy. Higher rates could hurt stock and bond markets, which in 
turn could put downward pressure on the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4844 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4968, and 1.4902 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4936. The British 
pound rose to $1.6223 from $1.6205. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8159 German 
marks, down from 1.8318; 6.0901 French francs, down from 6.1425.

<HEADLINE> Senate Kills Dairy Pricing System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For some struggling dairy farmers, the key to  
prosperity is to have states fix the price of milk. But the Senate 
dealt a blow to that idea today by refusing to keep alive New 
England's price-setting system. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the New England program want to extend it to New  
York, Pennsylvania and the South. However, they fell seven votes 
short of getting the 60 senators necessary to break a filibuster of 
a measure that would have extended the New England system for one 
year. It's scheduled to expire this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also would have blocked the Agriculture  
Department from going forward with an overhaul of its milk-pricing 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very clear. ... The Senate doesn't like cartels, whether  
it be for dairy or another commodity,'' said Sen. Herb Kohl, 
D-Wis., who led the filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups don't like the price-setting arrangements, known  
as ``dairy compacts,'' and upper Midwest farmers, who produce far 
more milk than they can sell in their region, fear they will lead 
to price-depressing surpluses nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the compacts are moving legislation through the  
House, and they said they weren't giving up on the Senate. 
Wednesday's vote showed a majority of senators support dairy 
compacts, said Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt. ``Getting a majority was 
very important,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Producers in the upper Midwest also would be the biggest  
beneficiaries of USDA's new pricing policy, which is intended to 
soften regional pricing disparities. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers are voting this week on the new pricing structure. While  
it could hurt many producers outside Minnesota and Wisconsin, the 
plan was expected to be approved nationwide because milk prices 
would otherwise be deregulated as of Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the USDA proposal are hoping that Congress will  
force the department to adopt an alternative plan that is closer to 
the current pricing system. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the government's current system, guaranteed minimum prices  
for fluid milk are lowest in the upper Midwest and highest in the 
South and West, up to $3 per hundred pounds higher in some places, 
because the price is based on a farm's distance from Eau Claire, 
Wis. The Depression-era system was designed to spur production in 
areas where it had been scarce. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Congress set the system for elimination and ordered  
USDA to come up with a new plan. Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn., said the 
department's plan was a ``very small movement in the right 
direction.''

<HEADLINE> Accused Starbucks Slayer Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A man accused of murdering three workers at a  
Starbucks coffee shop in the trendy Georgetown section of the 
nation's capital was charged Wednesday with a host of other crimes, 
including racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the District of Columbia has no death penalty,  
prosecutors indicated they could seek it against Carl Derick Cooper 
under the federal racketeering charges. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal grand jury returned a 48-count indictment against  
Cooper charging him with six armed robberies, the attempted murder 
of an off-duty police officer in Maryland, a bank robbery and a 
total of four murders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's indictment charges Mr. Cooper with leading a small but  
violent racketeering enterprise,'' said U.S. Attorney Wilma Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper, 30, was to be arraigned Thursday before a federal  
magistrate. 
</P>
<P>
	He was arrested last March and charged with the July 6, 1997  
murders of Emory Allen Evans, 25, Aaron David Goodrich, 18, and 
Mary Caitrin Mahoney, 24. The three employees of the Starbucks 
coffee shop were killed during a pre-dawn robbery attempt after the 
shop had just closed. 
</P>
<P>
	According to investigators, more than $10,000 was in the shop's  
safe at the time but Cooper left without taking anything, 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said convictions on any of the racketeering charges  
related to the Starbucks slayings could make Cooper eligible for 
the death penalty under federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to speculate as to what the result is going to  
be, but we will make that determination and recommendation to the 
attorney general as soon as we can,'' Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	District Councilman Harold Brazil said he would defer to the  
prosecutor on determining whether the death penalty under federal 
charges should be sought. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bringing this person to justice and seeking very harsh  
punishment if he's found guilty would be appropriate,'' said 
Brazil, who chairs the city council's Judiciary and Criminal 
Justice Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment alleges that Cooper was responsible for several  
crimes between 1993 and 1997, including the murder of a private 
security guard in 1993 in the lobby of an apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
	It also charges him with 1996 robberies of a pizza restaurant  
and a bank in Maryland and a massage parlor in Harrisburg, Pa., and 
the wounding of a Prince George's County, Md., police officer.

<HEADLINE> Boston Chicken Claims Buyout Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Boston Chicken Inc. has asked a federal Bankruptcy  
Court in Phoenix to change the process for bidding on its assets 
after receiving a buyout offer. 
</P>
<P>
	An investment group calling itself the Boston Market Acquisition  
Co., led by Jack Baum of Dallas-based Sagebrook Investments, has 
offered to buy Boston Chicken's assets for $140 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston Chicken's board of directors approved the financial terms  
of the sale on July 30, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	In a motion filed Tuesday, the company asked the court to amend  
portions of orders issued in June and July which require two 
creditors, GE Capital Corp. and Bank of America, to approve any 
purchase proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston Chicken, the parent company of the Boston Market  
restaurant chain, sought U.S. Bankruptcy Court protection from its 
creditors in October 1998 as it attempted to reorganize its 
finances while continuing to operate. 
</P>
<P>
	Baum told the Associated Press on Wednesday that his group  
believes the company's management team has the potential to take 
the brand forward once the company emerges from the 
court-supervised reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very rare for a company to go through bankruptcy and  
maintain such high brand recognition,'' he said. ``Market research 
shows people like the company's product and trust the name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baum said he has no plans to change the company's management  
structure. He also said the company will continue its licensing 
agreement with H.J Heinz Co., begun in June, to sell packaged food 
products in supermarkets nationwide under the Boston Market name. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to focus on three things: we are going to  
leverage the brand and work with Heinz to continue selling it in 
supermarkets; we are going to revitalize our 866 stores; and we are 
going to begin to develop our foreign markets,'' he said. ``We are 
going to move the company forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Wednesday, Boston Chicken stock slipped 3 1/4 cents to  
37 3/4 cents a share.

<HEADLINE> NAACP Stokes Flag Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The NAACP, which wants tourists to avoid  
South Carolina because the Confederate flag still flies over the 
Statehouse, is targeting companies who support pro-flag lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The civil rights group has amassed campaign records to learn  
which companies have donated money to those legislators. Supporters 
say the flag represents South Carolina's heritage and honors its 
war veterans; the NAACP considers it a symbol of slavery and 
racism. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at all of them, but especially those who have  
taken a public position in favor of leaving the Confederate battle 
flag flying,'' said Dwight James, executive director of the 
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's South 
Carolina branch. 
</P>
<P>
	James wouldn't reveal how the organization would use the  
information. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina, the only state with the Confederate battle flag  
flying above its Capitol, raised it at the Statehouse in 1962 to 
commemorate the Civil War's centennial. Several attempts to take it 
down have failed, including a lawsuit by business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Gov. David Beasley campaigned to remove it and lost in  
the November election. Democratic Gov. Jim Hodges, who promised not 
to revive the issue, said the Legislature lacks the political will 
to tackle it now. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the NAACP called for the travel boycott last month, the  
National Urban League and the Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference both have canceled convention plans in the state. There 
are no official estimates of the boycott's impact. 
</P>
<P>
	NAACP officials this week began reviewing financial disclosure  
forms filed by 14 senators and seven House members, most of whom 
have favored keeping the flag above the Capitol dome. Among those 
targeted were five black lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just curious as to who is supporting the people who  
didn't support our efforts,'' said Jim Wiggins, the NAACP's state 
branch manager. He said the group planned to examine all lawmakers' 
financial disclosure forms. The forms, required by law, list 
political contributions, income and business connections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently they don't think their boycott will work and so now  
they're looking for some other tactic to resort to,'' said state 
Sen. Glenn McConnell, R-Charleston, a flag supporter who owns a 
Confederate memorabilia gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the black lawmakers targeted by the NAACP, Sen. Robert  
Ford, suggested the Confederate flag stay and the black liberation 
flag, designed by black nationalist leader Marcus Garvey, be flown 
next to it. A black representative, Brenda Lee, said she could 
support moving the flag to a memorial on Statehouse grounds.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan May Leave Republican Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pat Buchanan, fearing there may be no room in  
the Republican presidential race for his candidacy or his 
blue-collar conservative issues, is considering bolting to the 
Reform Party, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	A major factor in his decision, which is not expected until the  
fall, will be the results of an Aug. 14 contest in Iowa testing the 
political strength of nine Republican presidential candidates, said 
officials close to Buchanan and in the Reform Party. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity, said  
Buchanan is worried that the Republican nomination process is 
geared in favor of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, and that he has 
little chance of winning or even pushing his social and economic 
issues to the forefront of the debate. 
</P>
<P>
	They say the candidate's sister, Bay Buchanan, has talked  
informally to a Reform Party official in recent weeks about a 
possible move. Such a step would be personally difficult for the 
former Nixon White House aide because of his long ties to the 
Republican Party, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	They say there also is a question of whether he has the will to  
mount a challenge for the Reform Party mantle and, if successful, 
wage a long-odds general election fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders worry that a Buchanan defection would drain  
support of the GOP's most conservative voters from the party's 
eventual nominee. Already, conservative Sen. Bob Smith of New 
Hampshire has abandoned the Republican Party for a third-party run 
at the White House. Buchanan defended him against criticism from 
GOP leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the party that stands for the conservative principles  
that Pat Buchanan has articulated so well throughout his life,'' 
Republican National Committee spokesman Mike Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors have circulated for weeks that Buchanan may switch  
parties, and his campaign has refused to rule out the option. 
Interviews Wednesday with a half dozen officials familiar with the 
discussions produced the strongest evidence yet that Buchanan is 
seriously considering the move. 
</P>
<P>
	In a little-noticed television interview last month, Buchanan  
complained that the GOP establishment had decided that he was not a 
viable candidate. ``If they slam those doors shut,'' he warned, 
``we'll just have to look for another way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Associates said the interview was a warning that Buchanan was  
willing to abandon his party. 
</P>
<P>
	More recently, his sister talked with Pat Choate, a family  
friend and 1996 Reform Party vice presidential candidate. She told 
him that Buchanan may leave the GOP if he isn't satisfied with the 
nominating process, according to two people well versed on the 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan declined to return several telephone calls, but The  
Washington Post in today's editions quoting him as saying, 
``There's nothing that's changed. ... I think this is being pumped 
up by people who, I think, do not wish us well in the straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first commitment is to my ideals and convictions. As Jack  
Kennedy once said, 'Sometimes party loyalty asks too much,' but 
right now I'm going down the road as a Republican,'' he told the 
Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Bay Buchanan, in a telephone interview from Montana, where she  
is vacationing, said, ``There has been no further development 
whatsoever'' since the TV interview ``when Pat said quite clearly 
that he will follow his ideas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan would not be assured of the presidential nomination in  
the fractious Reform Party. Backers of Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura 
have wrested the party leadership from associates of party founder 
Ross Perot. 
</P>
<P>
	While Perot supporters, such as Choate and past chairman Russell  
Verney, would welcome Buchanan to the party, Ventura has been cool 
to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reform Party nominee will have access to more than $12  
million in federal funding, millions more than Buchanan is expected 
to raise as a GOP candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan doesn't need to win the Iowa contest, but can't afford  
to finish far behind other conservative candidates such as Gary 
Bauer. A poor showing Aug. 14 would cast a pall over the campaign, 
making a party switch an even likelier option, associates say. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, who left CNN to launch his third presidential campaign  
in March, is a fiery orator with a potent blend of politics: He is 
conservative on social issues yet appeals to populist instincts on 
economic matters such as trade. He beat the GOP's eventual nominee, 
former Sen. Bob Dole, in the New Hampshire primary four years ago 
and finished a close second to President Bush in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Both times, Buchanan soon ran out of money and votes.

<HEADLINE> Directors Still in Hitchcock Shadow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- On Aug. 13, make that Friday the 13th, Alfred  
Hitchcock would have turned 100 years old. His portly shadow has 
never loomed larger. 
</P>
<P>
	Janet Leigh in a shower. James Stewart spying on his neighbors.  
Cary Grant chased by a crop-duster. Kim Novak in the churchtower. 
Not only have the images stayed with moviegoers, they've haunted 
moviemakers. No director so dominates a genre as Hitchcock does the 
thriller, and to make one is to be influenced by him, like it or 
not. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hitchcock is like a grammar book,'' Brian De Palma once said,  
``and it's all there to be learned.'' Directors have used his 
plots, his actors, his composer (Bernard Herrmann), and, in the 
case of Gus Van Sant, virtually an entire film. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past four decades, admirers have inadvertently created  
a subgenre, neo-Hitchcock: Van Sant's shot by shot remake of 
``Psycho''; Francois Truffaut's ``The Bride Wore Black''; John 
Schlesinger's ``Pacific Heights''; De Palma's ``Dressed to Kill''; 
Claude Chabrol's ``La Femme Infidele''; Andrew Davis' ``A Perfect 
Murder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In my lunches with him, when the subject of imitations came  
up, he would shrug and smile and say, `Let's talk about something 
else,''' said Hitchcock biographer Donald Spoto. ``Hitchcock had no 
great respect for most contemporary movies. He was far too busy in 
producing his own art.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His own influences came from both art and life. Born in London,  
just a few years after the invention of movies, Hitchcock began 
watching them as a teen-ager and even kept up with the industry 
trade journals. Around the same time, he read detective fiction and 
thrillers, especially the works of Edgar Allan Poe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very likely it's because I was so taken with the Poe stories  
that I later made suspense stories,'' Hitchcock once observed. ``I 
don't want to seem immodest, but I can't help comparing what I've 
tried to put in my films with what Edgar Allan Poe put in his 
novels (sic); a completely unbelievable story told to the readers 
with such spellbinding logic that you get the impression that the 
same thing could happen to you tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1920, his gifts as a sketch artist led to a job designing  
title cards at the London studios of the American film company 
Famous Players-Lasky. Hitchcock soon met a promising young editor 
and continuity supervisor named Alma Reville, whom he eventually 
married. Although only occasionally credited, she became his most 
trusted collaborator, his ultimate compliment being, ``Alma liked 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He would find a story, bring it back, have her read it, and if  
she thought it made a picture, fine. If she said no, he wouldn't 
touch it,'' said their daughter, Patricia Hitchcock O'Connell, who 
appeared in ``Strangers on a Train'' and other movies by her 
father. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they first saw the print of `Psycho,' right before it  
came out, there were just a few people in the screening room and 
everybody was raving about it. And they asked my mother, `What do 
you think?' And she said, `You can't send it out. Janet (Leigh) 
swallows when she's supposed to be dead.' Nobody else had caught 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From silent films such as ``The Lodger'' and ``The Ring'' to  
talkies like ``The Man Who Knew Too Much'' and ``The 39 Steps,'' 
Hitchcock became an internationally known director. In the late 
1930s, producer David O. Selznick brought him to the United States 
where he went on to make some of his most influential films, 
including ``Rear Window,'' ``Vertigo'' and ``Psycho.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For years he was regarded, and spoke of himself, as a popular  
entertainer. But in the 1950s, Truffaut and other French critics 
developed what became known as the ``auteur'' theory, interpreting 
movies as the director's personal vision. Hitchcock, who died in 
1980, was listed among the world's greatest filmmakers, canonized 
by Truffaut as ``the man we love to be hated by.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the 1960s, imitators had emerged and others found themselves  
compared to Hitchcock -- whether they liked it or not. 

</P>
<P>
                        *''The Prize'' (1964)    	
</P>
<P>
	Ernest Lehman, screenplay writer for ``North by Northwest,''  
also wrote this blatant, entertaining imitation. Directed by Mark 
Robson and based on a novel by Irving Wallace, ``The Prize'' stars 
Paul Newman as an alcoholic American novelist in Stockholm, where 
he is to receive the Nobel Prize. When a fellow honoree (Edward G. 
Robinson) is kidnapped, Newman helps find him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was taking a serious novel, written by a very close friend  
of mine, and trying to make a movie of it. But I finally lapsed 
into feeling that I could make a Hitchcock-type movie out of it,'' 
said Lehman, who even lifted a couple of scenes out of ``North by 
Northwest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``So I found myself doing that, and, of course, it didn't have  
Hitchcock. ... It didn't have the importance to be really compared 
to a Hitchcock film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                   *''The Bride Wore Black'' (1968)    	
</P>
<P>
	No one did more for Hitchcock's reputation than Truffaut, who  
wrote worshipfully of him in the '50s and in the 1960s collaborated 
with his idol on an interview book, when Truffaut was at his peak 
as a filmmaker. Eventually, he attempted his own Hitchcock-like 
thrillers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Bride Wore Black'' is based on a novel by ``William  
Irish,'' pen name for Cornell Woolrich, on whose short story ``Rear 
Window'' was based. Jeanne Moreau stars as Julie Kohler, a widow 
whose husband is gunned down on their wedding day. Cool and 
determined, she sets out to kill the men responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	Truffaut includes a few clever touches -- one would-be victim is  
arrested just as Julie is prepared to bump him off -- but Moreau 
looks bored (even for Moreau) and the story feels contrived. What 
was personal for Hitchcock becomes impersonal here. Even Truffaut 
didn't care for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Deliberate Hitchcock twist: In the novel, we only learn at the  
end why the murders were committed. In the film, Truffaut tells us 
early on. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                    *''La Femme Infidele'' (1969)    	
</P>
<P>
	In the mid-'50s, then-journalist Truffaut was supposed to  
interview Hitchcock in Paris, only to slip and fall into a nearby 
pond, postponing their first meeting for years. With him was 
another admirer, Claude Chabrol, whose films led some to call him 
the ``French Hitchcock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Set in Paris, this intelligent thriller reworks the plot of  
``Dial M for Murder'': The wife of an affluent businessman is 
having an affair. The husband catches on, confronts his rival and 
kills him. The wife becomes the chief suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	With his subtle wit and appreciation of detail, Chabrol has been  
the most accomplished of the master's disciples. It's the small 
touches that make the film work: the physical resemblance between 
the husband and the lover; the civilized banter that precedes the 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
	One sequence is especially worthy: The husband stuffs the corpse  
into a bag and dumps it into the trunk of his car. On his way to 
the lake, where he is to dispose of the body, the car is 
rear-ended. Witnesses emerge. A cop comes to offer help. Only by 
luck does the evidence remain concealed. 
</P>
<P>
	When the husband finally makes it to the lake, the dented trunk  
won't open. He must part with the entire car, which, as in 
``Psycho,'' only reluctantly slips beneath the surface. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                        *''Charade'' (1963)    	
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Donen, director of ``Singing in the Rain'' and other  
classic musicals, has long denied any Hitchcock influence on this 
chic thriller. ``He doesn't own the genre, any more than someone 
who makes a musical was automatically influenced by `Seven Brides 
for Seven Brothers,''' Donen said, referring to another of his 
films. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Donen wasn't thinking of him, ``chic thriller'' is  
almost another way of saying ``Hitchcock movie.'' Set in Paris, 
``Charade'' stars Audrey Hepburn as a precocious socialite whose 
husband has been murdered. Cary Grant is the mysterious man who may 
or may not be helping her. 
</P>
<P>
	Unintentionally or not, ``Charade'' works off a common Hitchcock  
theme -- multiple identities -- and features a rooftop struggle that 
recalls the rooftop struggle in ``To Catch a Thief.'' To its 
credit, ``Charade'' is blessed with that film's catty humor. ``It 
is infuriating,'' a lunch companion complains to the stylish 
Hepburn, ``that your happiness does not turn to fat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                      *''Monsieur Hire'' (1989)    	
</P>
<P>
	The French, Lehman complains, took Hitchcock a little too  
seriously. And so this film does. But Patrice Leconte's variation 
on the ``Rear Window'' story still is a highly effective 
psychological study, suggesting a collaboration in heaven between 
Hitchcock, Dostoevsky and Buster Keaton. 
</P>
<P>
	Michel Blanc plays a middle-age bachelor, pale and unsmiling and  
suspected for murder. His evenings are spent spying on an 
attractive young neighbor, whose boyfriend is also in trouble with 
the law. When the neighbor catches M. Hire in the act, she stalks 
him, befriends him and eventually humiliates him. 
</P>
<P>
	More sentimental than Hitchcock, Leconte tries hard to make us  
feel sorry for the title character; he didn't need to. Blanc's 
performance, as good as you could ask for, does the job. Not since 
Keaton has an actor earned so much sympathy simply by the intensity 
with which he opens and closes his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Best Hitchcock image, like something out of ``Psycho'': Blanc  
staring from his window, methodically eating spoonfuls of boiled 
egg. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                      *''High Anxiety'' (1977)    	
</P>
<P>
	``My father loved Mel Brooks,'' Patricia Hitchcock O'Connell  
says. ``He loved anything that had a sense of humor because my 
father had such a good sense of humor. He liked `High Anxiety' much 
better than the serious imitators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In this bawdy parody of ``Spellbound,'' ``Vertigo'' and other  
Hitchcock movies, Brooks stars as a psychiatrist who takes over The 
Psycho-Neurotic Institute for the Very, Very Nervous, where he 
confronts a resentful would-be director (Harvey Korman) and that 
shriveled sadist Nurse Diesel (Cloris Leachman). 
</P>
<P>
	The film is uneven, like virtually every Brooks comedy, but  
Hitchcock fans will enjoy the references and there are some great 
lines you'll have to see in context to appreciate: ``What a 
dramatic airport!'' ``Those who are tardy do not get fruit cup!'' 
``That kid gets no tip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Best sequence: Brooks chased by a bevy of birds, who unload  
their tidings upon him like great dollops of cookie dough. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                     *''The Crying Game'' (1992)    	
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock was the master of suspense, not surprise. Had he made  
this much-publicized film, the ``secret'' would have been revealed 
the moment Jaye Davidson appeared on screen, with a close-up that 
brought you straight to the heart of the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	But in other ways, ``The Crying Game'' is worthy of the  
Hitchcock tradition of ``identity thrillers,'' in which no one is 
what they appear to be. In the film, Stephen Rea stars as an IRA 
member drawn into a world of espionage, trapped between his 
political ties and his feelings for a British soldier's 
``girlfriend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The story I came up with was a challenge, a very imposing  
challenge, and Hitchcock's the only director I can think of who's 
managed stories that do these 90-degree turns,'' writer-director 
Neil Jordan said during a press conference shortly before the 
film's release. 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged watching ``Psycho'' and ``Vertigo'' while  
working on ``The Crying Game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In every situation he finds himself ... he has to make  
decisions,'' Jordan said of Rea's character, offering what could as 
easily be a description of Stewart in ``Vertigo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted a character in confrontation with every aspect of  
himself. The story allows me to peel his character away to his 
barest essence.''

<HEADLINE> Officer Speaks Out in Sex Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Air Force offered a transfer and ``a new  
career field'' to a lieutenant who refuses to work with women in an 
underground nuclear missile silo on religious grounds. But the 
officer says he still feels he's the target of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love my church, I love being in the military, I love my  
wife, I love my child,'' 1st Lt. Ryan Berry told a news conference 
today. ``I'm not being allowed to combine those loves. I have to 
sell one of them short.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berry, 26, who is stationed at Minot Air Force Base in North  
Dakota, complained last month that he was being disciplined by 
higher-ups for what he says are his strong Roman Catholic beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	He says those beliefs prevent him from being able to share such  
close quarters with a woman who is not his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to members of Congress released today, Gen. Michael  
Ryan, the Air Force chief of staff, said he agreed that the Air 
Force ``must accommodate religious beliefs to the maximum extent 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in Berry's case, it was decided that ``his personal  
convictions could no longer be accommodated without creating an 
unacceptable impact on the unit's ability to accomplish the 
military mission,'' Ryan wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will soon be scheduled for training to a new career field  
followed by an assignment to another installation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berry, a 1996 West Point graduate now serving in the Air Force,  
says he doesn't want to work with women in an area no bigger than a 
school bus, where the work day is usually 24 hours and there is 
only one bed available. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry's wife, Jill, stood with him at the news conference,  
holding their 6-month-old daughter, Juliana. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry has never done silo duty with a woman. But the Air Force  
signaled that accommodation would have to change if he remained at 
Minot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never disobeyed any order,'' Berry said. ``I've just  
asked to have my religious beliefs respected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His case has generated support from various religious groups and  
conservative lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	William Donohue, president of the Catholic League for Religious  
and Civil Rights, said Berry's problem in sharing close quarters 
with a woman ``is completely consistent with the Catholic faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he appreciates calls for more tolerance, particularly  
among women's groups, ``but where is the tolerance for him?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Hamilton, a lawyer who practices military law and is  
representing Berry, said the letter from Ryan promising Berry a new 
career field ``is a vapid response. It's nonsense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He has been punished for what he thinks,'' Hamilton said.  
``He's been ostracized. ... If the Air Force persists in 
stigmatizing Lieutenant Berry as a malcontent, we will exhaust all 
administrative remedies and then we will bring suit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Roscoe Bartlett, R-Md., a member of the House Armed  
Services Committee, said the Air Force policy of putting men and 
women together in such proximity could easily lead to sexual 
misbehavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is silly. This policy is stupid, quite apart from the  
religious aspects of it,'' Bartlett said. He called it ``a case of 
worshipping at the altar of political correctness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an April job performance review, Col. Ronald Haeckel, Berry's  
commander, said his refusal to work with women was unacceptable and 
``adversely impacted good order, discipline and morale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berry was decertified from working with nuclear missiles. He now  
works elsewhere in Minot's missile wing. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, Berry's lawyer, said that he is seeking to have the  
critical job performance review expunged from Berry's record.

<HEADLINE> Exec: Auto Biz Needs New Talent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) -- The auto industry faces ``a  
potentially devastating shortage of talent'' worldwide and must 
change its outdated image to attract the highly skilled workers it 
needs, a top Ford Motor Co. executive said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The perception among the general public, including educators  
and students, is that auto manufacturing is a second-class 
industry, that it takes place in dark, dirty environments, that our 
work force is uneducated and unskilled,'' vice chairman Peter J. 
Pestillo told an industry conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to do a better job of informing the outside world that  
our industry offers opportunities for forward-thinkers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pestillo said the problem is affecting suppliers and dealers as  
well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our industry is on the brink of a potentially devastating  
shortage of talent -- on the plant floors, in our salaried ranks and 
at our dealerships,'' he said. ``At every level, in all job 
categories, we need more good people and we need them today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pestillo cited a recent University of Michigan study that found  
85 percent of automotive suppliers reported they had been affected 
by the tight labor market, with the most critical need in the 
skilled trades. 
</P>
<P>
	He also criticized the nation's school system for failing to  
produce high school graduates with the entrepreneurial skills the 
industry needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's workplaces need people who are flexible and adaptable,  
who have an intuitive ability to solve problems and work in teams, 
who are independent, creative thinkers and can communicate 
effectively,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when schools do produce that kind of graduate, top students  
often don't want to work in manufacturing, Pestillo said. They're 
more likely to be lured into higher-profile, high-tech industries. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged industry leaders to get more involved in all levels of  
the education system, by taking part in curriculum planning and 
helping to set policy on local school boards. 
</P>
<P>
	Pestillo said Ford was working with 76 high schools in the  
United States, Canada and South Africa to educate students about 
manufacturing careers. 
</P>
<P>
	Other car companies are taking similar steps. DaimlerChrysler AG  
is working with high schools and the community college system in 
Oakland County, near Detroit, to promote manufacturing careers. 
</P>
<P>
	The labor shortage is especially critical in the car-repair  
business. The U.S. Labor Department estimates there's a shortfall 
of about 60,000 trained mechanics nationwide. Only two people enter 
the field for every 10 that leave. 
</P>
<P>
	To remedy the situation, automakers have instituted programs to  
help attract and train mechanics. Ford, for example, contracted 
recently with a private training firm to provide an intensive, 
54-week training program to produce entry-level mechanics. 
Participating dealers share the cost of graduates' tuition to 
retain them. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercedes-Benz has a similar program.

<HEADLINE> GOP Crafts $792 Billion Tax Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans, shrugging off a  
promise of a veto, nailed down the details of an agreement that 
would lower the tax rate of every American who pays income tax and 
promised passage by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great bill,'' House Ways and Means Chairman Bill  
Archer, R-Texas, said in announcing the deal late Tuesday. ``I hope 
the president will not veto a bill that has so much help for 
Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-year, $792 billion tax cut package put together by House  
and Senate Republicans would gradually cut 1 percentage point off 
each personal income tax rate. It also would provide relief from 
the so-called marriage penalty, cut the personal capital gains tax 
rate and eventually eliminate the estate tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with the start of the August vacation at the end of the  
week, negotiators moved with unusual speed over two days of talks 
to resolve differences in the House and Senate bills, each of which 
totaled $792 billion in cuts but differed substantially in details. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and House Speaker  
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., were actively involved in the negotiations, 
while Democrats, who overwhelmingly opposed the GOP plans, were 
shut out of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republicans have sequestered themselves in a room in order  
to piece together a political bill they know is going nowhere,'' 
said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., ranking Democrat on the Ways and 
Means panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House brushed off warnings by Lott and House Majority  
Leader Dick Armey that prospects are dimming that Congress and 
Clinton can agree on a tax bill this year. ``The remarks sound like 
two leaders in a sandbox,'' presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart 
said. ``If they don't get their way, they don't want to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the GOP tax numbers ``just don't add up. It's pretty  
clear the Republican leadership is interested in making a political 
statement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has said repeatedly that he will veto the GOP  
bill because he says the tax cut would use up almost all of the 
projected non-Social Security surplus over the next decade, leaving 
almost nothing for needed government programs and paying down the 
national debt. Clinton and most Democrats have said that any cut 
over $300 billion would be unacceptably risky to the nation's 
economic future. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans insist they can return the money to the taxpayers  
that rightfully belongs to them and still have enough to save 
Social Security and Medicare and pay down part of the national 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the GOP plan, each of the five tax brackets would go down  
by 1 percentage point. The lowest 15 percent tax bracket would fall 
to 14 percent in 2001, and the highest 39.6 percent bracket would 
become 38.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The House-passed bill included a 10 percent across-the-board tax  
cut, which was strongly criticized by the White House and Democrats 
as disproportionately favoring wealthy taxpayers. The 1 percentage 
point cut would give taxpayers in the 15 percent bracket a 7 
percent cut, better than that in the higher brackets. 
</P>
<P>
	To alleviate the marriage penalty, under which some married  
couples pay more in taxes than if they were single because their 
combined income moves them into a higher bracket, the Republican 
bill would gradually raise the standard deduction for couples until 
it is double the level permitted for individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, it would widen the current 15 percent bracket for  
couples so it would apply to some income that currently is taxed at 
28 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	There would be no cuts in the corporate capital gains tax, but  
personal capital gains taxes would be reduced from 20 percent to 18 
percent on some gains and 10 percent to 8 percent on others -- and 
adjusted annually for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance  
Committee, said contribution limits to individual retirement 
accounts would rise gradually from $2,000 to $5,000 annually. He 
said the self-employed would be permitted to deduct the entire cost 
of their health insurance premiums. Other officials said medical 
savings accounts, tax-deductible accounts set aside for 
health-related costs, would be more readily available. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP leadership planned to bring the bill before the House on  
Thursday and the Senate on Friday, securing passage before the 
August recess begins. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it would not be sent to the president until after  
Congress returned to work in September, giving supporters the 
chance to return home and tout the bill's benefits to their 
constituents. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans ``would like to take our message to the American  
people,'' Lott said. ``Maybe the president will conclude at some 
point that he needs to work with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Lott and other GOP leaders were talking aloud of the  
possibility that there will be no tax cut bill signed into law this 
year because the GOP-White House gap may be too wide to bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes inaction is better than wrong action, so if I can't  
see a way to come to a reasonable agreement, then the alternative 
would be to try to find a way to leave that money in place and let 
the debt be retired,'' Lott said.

<HEADLINE> A's Prospect Goes On Power Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Maybe it's the cereal that Adam Piatt  
munches on in the clubhouse prior to batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
	That would be as good an explanation as any to the power surge  
Piatt has had in professional baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	In 172 games at Mississippi State from 1995-97, and while using  
aluminum bats, Piatt had just 22 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, the 23-year-old Piatt is leading all minor leaguers  
with 34 homers and 110 RBIs through 110 games for Double-A Midland 
in the Texas League. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't know ... I think just growing up a little bit,  
getting more physically mature and certainly a better understanding 
of the pitchers and how they are going to work me,'' Piatt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Piatt says he's as surprised as anyone at the numbers, which  
also include a .340 batting average, a league-leading 103 runs 
scored and a .720 slugging percentage for Oakland's farm club. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't set goals as far as numbers go, but I thought  
if I hit 25 homers, it would be a great year,'' Piatt said before 
Midland wrapped up a six-game series at Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Piatt is already well past what he would have considered a great  
year in his second full professional season. And the RockHounds, 
after having Wednesday off, still have 30 games left. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just had to reassess, and I have to keep working and going  
out and trying to improve the last month of the season,'' he said. 
``It just comes down to mental toughness. You certainly get tired, 
but at the same time, you're playing a game and you have to have 
fun doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piatt was taken in the eighth round of the 1997 draft by the  
Oakland A's, which selected the third baseman while Mississippi 
State was playing in the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	During a short season at Medford, Ore., in the summer of 1997,  
Piatt made the transition to wood bats by hitting .292 with 13 home 
runs in 216 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Piatt led the Class A California League with 107  
extra-base hits. That included 20 homers, 16 of them coming in the 
last two months of his only season at Modesto. 
</P>
<P>
	After the quick progress Piatt has made, and the success he is  
having this season, expect the A's to put the third 
baseman-designated hitter on their 40-man protected roster after 
this season. If not, he becomes a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are happy with my progress right now,'' Piatt said.  
``They are not going to divulge too much in where I'm headed, but 
they certainly have let me know they are happy with my progress and 
they're happy with me as a prospect. So that's very positive.''

<HEADLINE> Chase Buys Mellon's Mortgage Outfit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chase Manhattan Corp.'s mortgage subsidiary has  
agreed to purchase the residential mortgage business of Mellon 
Bank, N.A. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase was the nation's third-largest residential mortgage  
originator last year, writing $85 billion in new loans, while 
Mellon originated $8 billion. Chase moved to first place in the 
first two quarters of this year, passing Countrywide and Norwest 
Mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
	``This acquisition expands our customer base significantly, by  
25 percent,'' said Thomas Jacob, Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corp.'s 
chairman and chief executive, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	With the acquisition, Chase would rise to first place from third  
in servicing residential loans, surpassing Bank of America and 
Norwest, said Steve Kim, research director at Inside Mortgage 
Finance, an industry newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase Manhattan Mortgage, based in Edison, N.J., serviced a  
portfolio of $327 billion in residential loans last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase, the terms of which were not disclosed, includes  
Mellon's $55 billion servicing portfolio and 630 customers. The 
Pittsburgh-based Mellon currently ranks fourteenth in mortgage 
servicing, Kim said.

<HEADLINE> Giants' Jones Getting His Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- If Cedric Jones is going to make something  
of his NFL career, this is his chance with the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into training camp, Jones is the Giants' starting  
defensive right end. The job opened when Chad Bratzke left to sign 
a $30 million contract with the Indianapolis Colts. 
</P>
<P>
	All Jones has to do is produce, something he hasn't done much  
since being taken with the fifth pick overall in the 1996 draft. 
His stats for three years show 39 tackles and four sacks in 41 
games, including three starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year alone, Bratzke had 80 tackles and 11 sacks.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody worries about Cedric,'' defensive line coach Denny  
Marcin said. ``I don't worry about Cedric. He'll be fine, if he 
stays healthy. He's 0-for-3 years there, you know. He has to 
overcome that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' first year was somewhat of a writeoff because he came to  
camp late and then was slowed by hamstring and eye injuries. A 
sprained knee and a leg injury limited him to nine games in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But just when it seemed like Jones was becoming another  
first-round bust like so many of the Giants' other draft picks in 
the '90s, things turned around last year. Jones stayed healthy, got 
his weight down to around 270 -- his college playing weight -- and 
started producing. Eighteen of his tackles and all four of his 
sacks came last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I have more of a sense of urgency,'' Jones said after  
practice at the University at Albany. ``I know from day one that I 
am going to be out there, but I want to make sure I stay out 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones is cutting no corners. He's become a workaholic on and off  
the field, which is one of the ways he cut his weight. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4 career sack leader at Oklahoma weighed in at 268  
pounds for training camp -- more than 30 pounds lighter than most 
offensive tackles. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you try to battle a 300-pounder and fight with them toe to  
toe all day, you are not going to win,'' Jones said. ``You have to 
keep them off balance and then try to knock them out and 
sneak-punch them. That's where speed and quickness help you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two-time Pro Bowl defensive end Michael Strahan also is helping.  
He's taken Jones under his wing. The two seem to show up every day 
for lunch together, making sure there are no misunderstandings. 
</P>
<P>
	Strahan and Bratzke were much like that.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not even comparing myself to Chad and what he did and what  
I do,'' Jones said. ``I'm trying to go out and do the things I do 
best to make this team succeed. First and foremost I have to worry 
about myself and make sure I take care of my responsibility.''

<HEADLINE> Linebackers Aplenty for Packers Now </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Green Bay linebackers coach Johnny  
Holland has reason to smile these days. 
</P>
<P>
	With the addition of proven veterans Anthony Davis and Lamont  
Hollinquest, the Packers could be building their deepest 
linebacking corps in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was signed last week as a free agent from Kansas City,  
where he led the Chiefs in tackles over the last four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Packers re-signed Lamont Hollinquest, who was  
waived by the Chiefs in July after leaving Green Bay as a free 
agent following last season. He was Green Bay's top backup last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Immediately, the Packers' linebacker depth went from a concern  
to a strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have taken an upgrade,'' starting outside  
linebacker Brian Williams said. ``Anthony Davis has a lot of 
experience and led his team in tackles the last couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then we added Lamont. He knows all the positions.''  
</P>
<P>
	Holland said the additions should mean improvement for all the  
linebackers. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you bring in competition, it always makes you better,''  
he said. ``We have some solid guys there. I'm pleased with all the 
guys right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Williams, George Koonce and Bernardo Harris starting, the  
Packers feel their linebacking corps can compete with any other 
unit in the Packers' recent past. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would think so,'' Williams said. ``I don't think we've had  
this much depth, this much experience. Besides Jude (Waddy), Davis 
and Lamont have been in the league longer than I have. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're going to be one of the better linebacking  
corps,'' Waddy said. ``We're a strong part of the defense. I can't 
wait to get started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis had 117 tackles last season for the Chiefs, 10 more than  
Green Bay's leading tackler, Williams, had last season, and is 
obviously hoping for a starting spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you have a guy breathing down your back it makes you  
play better,'' Holland said. ``If you go down, you got a guy 
filling your spot who can play. Then he may shine, and it may be 
hard to take him off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want competition. Our three starters want competition. We  
have a good group of guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Packers linebackers had no pass interceptions and the  
starters had just five sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	New coach Ray Rhodes wants more from this unit, which is why it  
was important to add Davis and Hollinquest. They add flexibility to 
a unit that lacked it last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel good about our linebacker depth now, but coming into  
camp we were a little nervous about it,'' Rhodes said. ``We didn't 
have enough depth. With Davis and Hollinquest coming in, that gives 
us a lot of depth.''

<HEADLINE> Jim Brown, Wife Discuss 911 Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The wife of Hall of Fame football star Jim  
Brown said in a 911 call that he beat her car with a shovel and 
threatened to kill her. On Wednesday, she denied ever feeling 
threatened and claimed police overreacted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I dialed 911 and I used it because I was angry. I was trying  
to get leverage,'' Monique Brown said Wednesday at the couple's 
Hollywood Hills home, where the media was summoned to hear the 911 
audio tape. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no reason to call. There was no emergency,'' she  
said, her husband at her side. ``I did not feel threatened at any 
time -- never felt I was in any danger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the 911 emergency call transcript provided by the couple,  
Mrs. Brown identifies herself only as Monique Brown and she doesn't 
mention her ex-football player husband is Jim Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Brown, who was making the call from a neighbor's home, told  
the operator: ``He's inside the house, he just beat my car with a 
shovel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later she said: ``He has a gun in the house but he doesn't use  
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The operator asked at one point: ``He didn't hit you today?''  
</P>
<P>
	``Not today,'' Mrs. Brown answered.  
</P>
<P>
	``OK. But if there's a history of domestic violence, right?''  
the operator said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' Mrs. Brown said.  
</P>
<P>
	``And he threatened to kill you today?''  
</P>
<P>
	``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Browns wouldn't comment about the reference to a history of  
domestic violence, but lawyer William Graysen said the former 
football star has no recent criminal record for domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Brown has a long history of arrests. In 1986, his  
then-fiancee declined to press charges after he allegedly beat her. 
In 1985, charges that he struck and raped a woman were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1978, he was fined and served a day in jail for beating up a  
golf partner. In 1971, charges that he battered two women were 
dropped after they failed to testify at his trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1968, he was accused of assault with intent to murder when  
his then-girlfriend was found semi-conscious under the balcony of 
his apartment. The charge was dropped when the woman said she had 
fallen. And in 1965, a jury found Brown innocent of assaulting an 
18-year-old girl in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, 63, denied threatening his wife and alleged that police  
harassed and coerced her into making abuse statements. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't threaten people. In fact, I've never threatened  
people. ... I have no idea what's going to happen. I know that I 
should be exonerated,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who was arrested June 15, pleaded innocent July 9 to one  
count of making terrorist threats and one count of vandalism, both 
misdemeanors. Trial was set for Aug. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Lara Bloomquist, who supervises the City Attorney's domestic  
violence unit, said Mrs. Brown, 25, was on the trial witness list, 
but ``whether she'll be for the prosecution remains to be seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bloomquist said Mrs. Brown's contention that the case wasn't  
serious was not unusual in domestic violence cases. About 
two-thirds of domestic violence victims seen by her office recant 
their stories, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This wasn't an issue of recantation,'' Mrs. Brown said  
Wednesday. ``From the moment they got there, I was telling them 
there was no threat. I just wanted to come home. I wanted to come 
home, back to my husband.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Brown could be sentenced to 18 months in jail,  
three years' probation and ordered to complete domestic violence 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said it angered him that 15 to 20 police cars showed up at  
his home and officers armed with shotguns arrested him. He said 
Wednesday the show of force was a police overreaction because he's 
a black celebrity who works with ex-gang members and ex-convicts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm considered one of those individuals that are not  
controlled,'' Brown said. ``They have a record of not being able to 
get me. I think they have a policy that they would like to get me 
... what you want to do is nullify all voices in the community that 
are strong and have influence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The number of officers sent to Brown's home wasn't immediately  
known. 
</P>
<P>
	``The call came from his wife and we were responding to a  
domestic violence call. There were indications she was in fear,'' 
Officer Guillermo Compos said Wednesday. ``We have responded to his 
home before because there were problems that were there before.''

<HEADLINE> Small Fire Damages Fenway Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A worker's blowtorch was blamed for a small fire  
at Fenway Park this morning that damaged a restroom wall and forced 
the Red Sox to close one entrance to the park for 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire broke out shortly after 11:30 a.m. in a wall outside a  
rooftop bathroom along the third base line. No injuries were 
reported and the 1:05 p.m. game against the Cleveland Indians was 
expected to start on time. 
</P>
<P>
	There are seats on the roof, but no one was there at the time.  
</P>
<P>
	The park was not evacuated, but the team delayed opening the  
gates along Yawkey Way. Gates usually would have opened at 11:35 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters extinguished the fire in about five minutes.  
</P>
<P>
	Steve MacDonald, a spokesman for the Boston Fire Department,  
said the accidental fire caused about $25,000 in damage. Fire crews 
had to rip out some of the walls ensure the flames didn't spread. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers had been doing some repairs to the ballpark's roof when  
the torch ignited some wood in the bathroom's interior walls. 
</P>
<P>
	MacDonald said the age of the ballpark -- built in 1912 -- had  
nothing to do with the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Age has nothing to do with this,'' MacDonald said. ``It's an  
accidental fire.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. May Buy Back Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, seeking ways to  
manage the government's finances in a new era of budget surpluses, 
said today it is exploring buying back a portion of the $3.6 
trillion national debt held by the public, something that has not 
been done since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department released for public comment a proposal  
that would allow it to take competitive offers from bond holders on 
a voluntary basis to reduce the amount of debt. Officials said that 
after a 60-day comment period they hope to establish final rules 
for the procedure by January. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to reporters at the White House, President Clinton said  
the new procedures will set the stage for completely eliminating 
debt held by the public by 2015, something that has only happened 
once before in the nation's history, in 1835 when Andrew Jackson 
was president. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton likened the proposal to a family refinancing its  
mortgage to save when interest rates decline and then paying off 
the mortgage early to eliminate interest payments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's refinance our nation's mortgage and then wipe the ledger  
clean,'' Clinton said. ``We have the chance of a lifetime to do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said at a separate briefing,  
``It is critically important that we manage the debt held by the 
public as efficiently as we can in this new environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury has not bought back securities since 1972, when a  
few existing bonds and notes held by the public were swapped for 
new debt issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of huge budget deficits in the 1980s and early 1990s,  
the national debt has exploded, climbing from less than $1 trillion 
before Ronald Reagan took office to $5.5 trillion currently. 
</P>
<P>
	Of that amount, $3.6 trillion is in public hands and the rest is  
held by government trust funds, the largest one being the Social 
Security trust fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The government last year enjoyed its first budget surplus since  
1969. And the administration is projecting that last year's record 
$69.2 billion surplus will be followed by an even bigger surplus of 
$98.8 billion this year, marking the first back-to-back surpluses 
since Dwight Eisenhower was president in 1956 and 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the administration and the Congressional Budget Office  
are projecting continued surpluses over the next 15 years -- 
assuming agreements to cut government spending are honored -- enough 
to totally eliminate the $3.6 trillion in debt held by the public 
in 2015. 
</P>
<P>
	However, this prospect is requiring Treasury to explore ways to  
better manage the massive Treasury securities market. 
</P>
<P>
	Up until now, it has been able to just reduce the size of new  
borrowings rather than being required to buy back debt from the 
public. But officials said they do not want to reduce current 
offerings too much and believe they can save taxpayers money 
through lower interest rates by buying back debt already held by 
the public, much of it at higher rates than current offerings 
receive. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers told reporters that use of debt buybacks raises a  
``number of complex issues that will need to be worked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials stressed that any government purchases would be on an  
entirely voluntary basis. They would be done through a type of 
reverse auction in which the government would announce the type of 
securities it was interested in buying and accept the most 
competitive bids from holders of those securities. 
</P>
<P>
	If bond holders wanted too much to sell their securities back to  
the government, Treasury would have the option of making no 
purchases for that option. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Gensler, treasury undersecretary for domestic finance, said  
after all the public comments are received, the administration 
hopes to publish a final rule by Jan. 1. But he said no 
determination has been made on when the first debt buyback would be 
held. 
</P>
<P>
	Gensler announced another change in Treasury auctions today that  
will take effect immediately, a reduction in the number of times 
new 30-year bonds are sold from three times a year to only twice. 
The sales will occur in February and August; November sales will be 
stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	The debt buybacks and the reduction in sales of 30-year bonds  
are part of the government's effort to make sure that the average 
length of maturity for its debt does not increase too much. 
</P>
<P>
	It is currently at 5.4 years. Without the debt buybacks, the  
average maturity is projected to rise to 7 years, something that 
would mean higher borrowing costs for the government since 
investors demand higher interest rates for longer-term bonds.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Contends Sotomayor Is Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Angry Cuban officials disputed  
Wednesday night that high jump great Javier Sotomayor ingested 
cocaine, as a Pan American Games drug test revealed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The man is completely innocent and we trust him,'' Dr. Mario  
Granda of the Cuban medical group said. ``He said he has not taken 
a banned substance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Granda suggested Sotomayor was ``manipulated,'' but he said he  
did not blame anyone specifically. 
</P>
<P>
	Pan Ams officials said earlier that Sotomayor, winner of the  
high jump gold medal last Friday night for his record fourth 
consecutive triumph in the event, tested positive for cocaine. 
Sotomayor was stripped of the gold and faces a two-year suspension 
that would eliminate him from this month's World Track and Field 
Championships and next year's Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban federation is expected to appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	Losing the gold medal cost Cuba its third consecutive victory in  
track and field. With Sotomayor's medal, the Cubans had won 11 
golds. Without it, their 10 golds dropped them into a tie with the 
United States, with the Americans having more total medals. 
</P>
<P>
	Granda said Sotomayor, the world indoor and outdoor  
record-holder and the 1992 Olympic champion, was tested in more 
than 60 competitions, including eight this year, and never tested 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is in a program against social doping in Cuba,'' Granda  
said. ``He is an innocent man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Primo Nebiolo, president of the International Amateur Athletic  
Federation, track and field's world governing body, also was 
surprised Sotomayor was found guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am shocked. I cannot believe it. I am very surprised and  
upset, because I have great esteem for Sotomayor,'' Nebiolo said at 
a meet in Monaco. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Vasquez Rana, president of the Pan American Sports  
Organization, said that in doping cases, his group does not 
differentiate a recreational drug such as cocaine from a 
performance-enhancing substance such as a steroid. 
</P>
<P>
	``To us, it is sanctioned as an infraction,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But Cuban officials insisted Sotomayor never took cocaine and  
charged the substance had been planted in something he ate or 
drank. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is such a such a gentleman. To us, it is almost impossible  
he would take this substance,'' said professor Rodrigo Alvarez 
Cambra, director of the orthopedic complex of Cuba. ``He has told 
us he has not taken this substance and we believe his word. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is why we know this is a manipulation in the case of  
Javier Sotomayor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Granda added, ``We hope those who manipulated these results or  
enhanced these results or altered the results of a person who never 
took this substance will never do this again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eduardo de Rose, medical chief for the Pan Am Games committee,  
said it made no difference where the cocaine originated or why it 
was taken, even if it was in a medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the substance is found in urine, we do not question where  
it came from and the reason for taking it,'' de Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor's urine sample showed cocaine in the amount of 200  
parts per million, which would be consistent with a person who uses 
the drug, de Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the discovery of cocaine traces indicates the drug would  
have been taken four to five days before the test. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than that, we would not find it,'' he said. ``When we  
find traces of cocaine ... it shows the ingestion was very 
recent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Granda called Sotomayor a ``complete sports gentleman'' and said  
he was a ``flagbearer for the struggle against doping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``His dignity is much above and beyond any results given in any  
laboratory,'' Granda said. 
</P>
<P>
	Granda said Sotomayor's fourth gold medal ``will be in the  
hearts of all Pan Americans who love you and trust you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the Winnipeg Convention Center, about 25 protesters  
circled in front of the main entrance, holding signs saying, ``Let 
Cuba Play,'' and ``Pan Am is a sporting event not a politcal 
event.''

<P>
	Robin Ventura and the New York Mets have the Atlanta Braves in  
unfamiliar territory -- second place. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets, 15-4 since the All-Star break, are a game in front of  
the Braves, who lost to Pittsburgh 7-1 after the Mets defeated 
Milwaukee 10-3 Tuesday night. It's the first time since 1994 that 
the Braves have been out been out of first place in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura went 4-for-4 with a homer and three RBIs for the Mets  
and has six homers and 12 RBIs in his last seven games. He had RBI 
singles in the first and third innings and hit his 24th homer for a 
6-2 lead in the fifth. He walked in the seventh and added a single 
in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the course of my career, I've been streaky in that way,''  
Ventura said. ``For a long period of time I won't hit a lot of home 
runs, and then I'll go for a while where I hit them, usually more 
in the second half than the first half, and I don't know why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other NL games, it was Cincinnati 2, Colorado 1; Philadelphia  
6, Florida 5; St. Louis 6, San Diego 0; Montreal 9, the Cubs 4; 
Houston 7, Los Angeles 2; and San Francisco 3, Arizona 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Orel Hershiser (11-8) allowed three runs in 7 1-3 innings and  
Mike Piazza hit a three-run homer and drove in four runs for 
visiting New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza had an RBI groundout in the first and his 23rd home run  
in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser allowed six hits, struck out four and walked two.  
Masato Yoshii, demoted to the bullpen, retired the side on four 
pitches in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Yoshii's first relief appearance after 49 starts for the  
Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Pulsipher (3-2) allowed six runs -- four earned -- and nine  
hits in five innings in his first start against his former team. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Pirates 7, Braves 1    	
</P>
<P>
	At Pittsburgh, Kris Benson pitched four-hit ball for eight  
innings, and all four Pirates hits off Atlanta starter Kevin 
Millwood were solo homers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates didn't have a hit until Kevin Young hit his 16th  
homer to start the fifth, then proceeded to hit three more homers 
off Millwood (12-6) -- by Al Martin, Brian Giles and Warren Morris -- 
in the next two innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Benson (9-8) has allowed two runs on 10 hits in 17 innings in  
his last two starts.

<P>
                          *Reds 2, Rockies 1

	Aaron Boone hit a tiebreaking single with the bases loaded in  
the bottom of ninth for Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds won for the eighth time in 10 games and beat a wild  
Mike DeJean (2-4). DeJean came on with one out in the ninth and 
walked Greg Vaughn, gave up a single to Barry Larkin and walked 
Eddie Taubensee to load the bases. Boone then lined his first pitch 
to left for the win. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Williamson (10-4) worked out of a ninth-inning jam to earn  
the victory. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Phillies 6, Marlins 5    	
</P>
<P>
	At Miami, Rico Brogna and Mike Lieberthal hit back-to-back home  
runs in the eighth inning to lift Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Chad Ogea, an emergency starter for the Phillies, held Florida  
hitless the first five innings. He left after giving up three runs 
and three hits in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Curt Schilling was scheduled to start for the Phillies, but he  
returned to Philadelphia about two hours before game time upon 
learning that his pregnant wife was hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Brogna led off the eighth with his 14th homer. Lieberthal  
followed with his 22nd off Brian Edmondson (4-6).

</P>
<P>
	At St. Louis, Darren Oliver pitched a four-hit shutout and Mark  
McGwire's drive for 500 homers stalled. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver (7-7) had a career-high 11 strikeouts and walked two to  
win his third straight start and pitch his third career shutout. 
The four hits allowed were a career low. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres' Tony Gwynn went 0-for-4 to remain at career 2,995  
hits. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who singled and scored twice, has 498 career homers.

in his Cardinals debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Boehringer (6-4) worked seven innings and allowed three  
runs on five hits.

	The Cubs lost for the ninth time in 11 games, spoiling the first  
career start for Micah Bowie (0-2), acquired Saturday from Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Sammy Sosa went 1-for-4 with three strikeouts to remain tied  
with McGwire for the major league home run lead at 41. 
</P>
<P>
	Vazquez (5-5) gave up three runs and seven hits in five  
innings.

<HEADLINE> Honda Vows To Stay Independent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) -- Honda Motor Co. is committed to  
remaining independent despite the trend toward consolidation of the 
auto industry, president Hiroyuki Yoshino said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at an industry conference, Yoshino disputed the  
conventional wisdom of industry executives that only large, global 
automakers with great economies of scale will survive in the 21st 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	``They argue that the challenge of global customer satisfaction  
is a job description for which only large companies need apply,'' 
Yoshino said. ``We believe that success in the future has little to 
do with size.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past year, No. 3 U.S. automaker Chrysler Corp. merged  
with Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, No. 2 Ford Motor Co. bought Volvo 
Cars of Sweden, and France's Renault SA bought a stake in Japan's 
Nissan Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoshino said Honda does not need to merge with another automaker  
to expand its global presence. It already has 100 plants in 34 
countries, part of its longstanding policy of developing and 
building cars, motorcycles and other motorized products in the 
markets where they're sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese automaker's goal is to combine the speed,  
flexibility and efficiency of a small company with the global reach 
and technological strength of a large company. Honda is the world's 
eighth-largest automaker by production. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda has proven that a car plant doesn't need high volumes --  
more than 200,000 vehicles -- to be profitable, he said. In China, 
Brazil and Thailand, Honda has built plants with capacities of 
10,000 to 30,000 vehicles that make money. 
</P>
<P>
	``In each case, we first entered the market with motorcycle  
production that requires only one-tenth the investment of an auto 
plant,'' Yoshino said. ``This serves as an effective stepping stone 
to auto production.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Honda is embarking on a new manufacturing system at its two  
largest Japanese plants that will allow them to produce more models 
on fewer assembly lines. Equipment will be designed to produce 
multiple products at the push of a button, allowing Honda to shift 
production to models in the greatest demand, Yoshino said.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Up on Weather / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures advanced strongly a  
third day Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid expectations 
recent hot, dry weather will reduce expected bumper harvests. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices have rallied sharply in the past week on the  
unexpected turn in fortunes for a crop that many originally thought 
would exceed all estimates for production. 
</P>
<P>
	Hot, dry weather has taken its toll on crops in Illinois, one of  
the two largest growing states, and eastward. 
</P>
<P>
	While corn and soybean harvests likely will remain quite large,  
the reductions could come at a fortuitous time. Demand to Asia, a 
key exporting region for U.S. producers, is on the rise as 
countries there shake off economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 5 cents to $3.06 1/4 a bushel;  
December corn rose 5 3/4 cents to $2.36 1/2 a bushel; December oats rose 
1 1/4 cents to $1.18 1/4 a bushel; November soybeans rose 15 3/4 cents to 
$4.94 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle and lean hog futures were mixed on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, while feeder cattle and pork bellies 
retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle rose .08 cent to 64.35 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .25 cent to 76.07 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs rose .75 cent to 50.45 cents a pound; August pork bellies fell 
2.90 cents to 56.72 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Hate Crime Bill Nearing Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After several years of lobbying, supporters of  
a bill to increase the government's power to prosecute hate crimes 
say they are closer than ever to seeing it passed by Congress and 
signed into law. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the Senate approved it without debate and added  
the bill to its version of a government spending measure for the 
fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Judiciary Committee followed Wednesday with a hearing.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is the furthest that the Hate Crimes Prevention Act has  
ever come and we're quite hopeful that wisdom will prevail as it 
has in the Senate,'' Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the 
Human Rights Campaign, a lesbian and gay political organization, 
said in an interview during a break in the House hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP's Washington bureau, said  
the number of hate crimes that have attracted the nation's 
attention since the bill was introduced in late 1997 ``is still 
overwhelming in so many different ways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The bill needs to be passed,'' he said in an interview. ``The  
inaction of Congress on an issue like this is as devastating as the 
acts themselves in many ways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the hearing, Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who is undecided on  
the proposal, denounced hate crimes as ``senseless acts of 
inhumanity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would add disability, gender and sexual orientation to  
federal anti-bias laws and make it easier for the Justice 
Department to investigate and prosecute such offenses, as well as 
to assist local law enforcement authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton supports the legislation, which is sponsored  
by Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the Judiciary committee's top 
Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Wednesday, Clinton reiterated that Congress must  
pass a hate crimes bill that removes limits to federal 
intervention, expands coverage and lets local authorities retain 
primary jurisdiction over such offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any bill that does not include these three elements falls far  
short of what America needs in our battle against hate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law now prohibits crimes based on race, color, religion  
or national origin. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight states have no hate crime laws. Twenty-one states have  
laws covering sexual orientation, 22 include gender in their 
anti-bias laws and 21 cover disability. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the bill is unnecessary since states prosecute hate  
crimes. They also say the bill would burden the federal courts and 
discriminate by creating special classes of people with more rights 
than those not in the protected groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``All violent crime, whatever the motivation, is wrong and all  
victims should receive equal protection under law,'' the 
conservative Family Research Council said in a statement 
distributed at Wednesday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder defended the bill, saying  
that while an assault with the intent to kill is ``always worthy of 
prosecution'' an assault with the intent to kill a gay person is 
even more serious and worth special consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not only an attack on the individual,'' he said. ``It is  
also an attack on the group that that person is a member of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holder also noted that since he testified on the subject before  
the Senate in May, a young man linked to a white supremacist group 
allegedly shot several people in Illinois and Indiana, killing a 
graduate student from South Korea and black man walking with his 
daughters. Three synagogues in California also were set afire. 
</P>
<P>
	Carole Carrington of Eureka, Calif. -- whose daughter,  
granddaughter and a female friend of the family from Argentina were 
killed while visiting Yosemite National Park in February -- 
testified that they were killed ``simply because they were women.'' 
The hate crimes bill is needed to ``send a message to perpetrators 
that violence against women will be punished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1082.

<HEADLINE> Bengals Bring in Steelers' Castoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GEORGETOWN, Ky. (AP) -- Poor conditioning and extra weight got  
Jamain Stephens run out of Pittsburgh. Cincinnati Bengals coach 
Bruce Coslet, however, is happy to have the former first-round 
pick's bulk on his offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	Waived Friday by the Steelers after failing to complete a set of  
40-yard runs on the opening day of training camp, Stephens was back 
on the field Wednesday for his first practice as a Bengal. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a big man, and those big guys are hard to find,'' Coslet  
said of the offensive tackle. ``He's played in the league. We're 
looking to improve ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephens said he is ready to put his Pittsburgh experience  
behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels good,'' he said. ``I've got a fresh start, a new  
beginning, a new environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephens said he currently weighs over 350 pounds, and needs to  
lose at least 20 pounds to get down to his normal playing weight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I lose weight pretty easily,'' he said. ``I'll probably drop  
three or four pounds just today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coslet isn't convinced Stephens needs to slim down.  
</P>
<P>
	``He could stand to lose a little, but he's a big man. He  
doesn't look too sloppy to me,'' he said. ``We don't arbitrarily 
assign weight. We'll watch him work out and then make some 
suggestions if need be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The North Carolina A&AMP;T product was the 29th player taken in the  
1996 draft, but struggled with weight problems throughout his 
Pittsburgh tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, there were questions whether Stephens would survive  
the Steelers' final roster cutdown, but he went on to start 10 
games when the offensive line was hit by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was controversy from day one,'' Stephens said of his  
three seasons in Pittsburgh. ``The ice never broke for me there. 
... I have no hard feelings against coach Cowher or the whole 
Steelers organization. They were nothing but patient with me the 
whole time I was there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephens blamed his July 3 wedding for causing his conditioning  
to slip during the last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of honeymooned a little longer than I should have,'' he  
said. ``I lost focus. I started feeling sorry for myself.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several senators sought today to register  
congressional displeasure with Iran's crackdown on student 
protesters and democracy advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an untenable situation and should be loudly and  
categorically condemned by all free nations of the world,'' said 
Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	Brownback, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee  
on Near Eastern and South Asian affairs, and Sen. Joseph Lieberman, 
D-Conn., drafted a resolution condemning ``the repressive actions 
taken by the Iranian government against the democratic movement of 
Iran.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mass student demonstrations erupted in Iran last month. Some  
protesters demanded the ouster of Iran's hard-line supreme leader, 
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a figure traditionally held above 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,200 people were arrested during the protests.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sadly, the response of the Iranian government to this orderly  
exercise of democratic protest has been more of the same repression 
-- more imprisonment, more torture and more death,'' said Lieberman. 
</P>
<P>
	Also sponsoring the resolution are Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., and Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and chairman of the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	It calls on the Iranian government to respect fundamental  
principles of human rights and to release unharmed the student 
leaders and other pro-democracy activists. 
</P>
<P>
	Iran's president, Mohammed Khatami, has promised great political  
and social rights but he is locked in a struggle with hard-liners. 
</P>
<P>
	Brownback told reporters it is ``wishful thinking'' to expect to  
see any signs of moderation from the present government in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	``These pro-democracy activists need to know that the world has  
heard their voices and that the world is watching and aware of the 
pressure and repression to which they are being subjected,'' 
Brownback said.

<HEADLINE> More Than 500M Guns Said on Planet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- More than 500 million guns and other small  
arms are circulating around the world, widely used because they are 
lethal, inexpensive, easy to care for and easy to hide, a U.N. 
panel says. 
</P>
<P>
	Assault rifles, machine guns, pistols and grenade-launchers are  
increasingly ``the weapon of choice'' in contemporary conflicts, 
the U.N. Department for Disarmament said in a report Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The excessive and destabilizing accumulation and transfer of  
small arms and light weapons is closely related to the increased 
incidence of internal conflicts and high levels of crime and 
violence,'' the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of innocent people, particularly children, have been  
killed by small arms, which are manufactured and sold legally and 
illegally, the report said. About 40 percent of the worldwide flow 
of small arms comes from illicit trafficking that serves warlords, 
drug traffickers, terrorists and other criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also outlined progress being made on implementing  
recommendations in a 1997 U.N. report, including ways to prevent 
and reduce the excessive accumulation and transfer of small arms. 
</P>
<P>
	It also proposed that an international conference on the illicit  
arms trade, which the General Assembly has decided to hold no later 
than 2001, focus on international efforts to prevent, combat and 
eradicate illegal transfers. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, sent to the General Assembly by Secretary-General  
Kofi Annan, urged all states to exercise ``utmost restraint'' in 
transfers of small arms and ammunition to conflict areas. 
</P>
<P>
	In view of the theft of large numbers of weapons from storage  
facilities in many countries, the panel also recommended that all 
nations take measures to prevent loss of weapons through theft, 
corruption or neglect. 
</P>
<P>
	The group said it also wants a study on the feasibility of  
restricting the manufacture and trade in small arms to authorized 
manufacturers and dealers to be completed before the U.N. 
conference.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Says He Hasn't Taken Andro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire, adamant in spring training that  
he would keep taking androstenedione, disclosed Wednesday he has 
not used the supplement for four months. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who has hit 41 homers this year and is two short of No.  
500, made the revelation before his St. Louis Cardinals played the 
San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought long and hard about it and I don't like the way it  
was portrayed like I was the endorser of the product, which I 
wasn't,'' McGwire said. ``I don't like how it's portrayed, but 
young kids take it because of me. I don't like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire said the fact his record 70-homer season was linked to  
andro, a testosterone booster, likely encouraged youngsters to try 
it. That was perhaps the biggest reason for his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I discourage young people from taking it,'' he said. ``If  
you're old enough and you have your own mind, you can do whatever 
you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Classified as a dietary supplement, andro is permitted in  
baseball, but is banned by the Olympics, the NCAA, the NFL, and the 
men's and women's tennis tours. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's admission that he used andro sparked a tenfold  
increase in sales of the supplement last fall, much of it through 
the Internet, and led many steroid experts to warn of serious 
health consequences for teen-agers who take it to emulate McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball has commissioned a study of andro by  
Harvard scientists. No decision is expected until later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, McGwire acknowledged to The Associated Press that  
he had used andro for more than a year. Colorado's Dante Bichette 
was among a group of other players who said they took it. 
</P>
<P>
	As spring training opened this year, McGwire said andro was  
legal and that it had ``absolutely nothing to do with me hitting a 
baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said then he took it to get through late-season workouts.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't endorse the product and I never did,'' he said then.  
``Someone stuck their nose in my locker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's recent statistics appear to show that he's fine  
without andro. Before Wednesday, he had homered 14 times in 18 
games, and began the game one homer behind major league leader 
Sammy Sosa.

<HEADLINE> Don Garber Named MLS Commissioner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Major League Soccer has a new commissioner, and he comes from a  
branch of the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Garber, who had been senior vice president of the NFL's  
international division, was introduced today in New York as the 
successor to Doug Logan, who was removed after serving as the 
league's only commissioner since it started in 1996. Logan's 
contract ran through next season, but the league's financial 
backers were unhappy with the way the MLS has been drawing at the 
gate and its flat TV ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear I've lost confidence of the board of governors and  
it's time to move on,'' Logan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Board of Governors chairman Stuart Subotnick of the New York-New  
Jersey MetroStars, who announced the change, said the league needed 
to better connect with the fan. 
</P>
<P>
	``One area we have not moved as positive as we would like starts  
with fan,'' said Subotnick. ``If you want a successful business, 
you need to get the loyalty of the customer, in this case the fan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We started with a bang, it leveled off and we're creeping up  
again. That's OK if you want a middling business. We don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Logan had predicted a 15 percent increase in average attendance  
from the league's first year to the second. But attendance actually 
fell from 17,406 to 14,619, a 16 percent drop. 
</P>
<P>
	It further fell to 14,312 last season, but has rebounded to  
15,174 through this past weekend's games. 
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old Garber will oversee all business operations of  
the 12-team MLS. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked for the NFL for 15 years. During the last three, he  
was in charge of the league's business ventures outside the United 
States, including television production and right distribution and 
various marketing and fan development activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Before taking over as head of NFL International, Garber was vice  
president of business development and special events for NFL 
properties, the league's marketing arm. 
</P>
<P>
	MLS operates under a ``single-entity'' concept in which  
companies invest in the league and receive the rights to operate a 
club. The league contracts with all the players, assigns the major 
stars to clubs in the name of competitive balance and gate 
attraction, and pays them from a central fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the salaries the league negotiates with the players,  
each team must stay under a $1.7 million salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Logan said he may be down, but not out.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday I was an 'is'. Today I'm a 'was'. Tomorrow, I assure  
you, I'm going to be an 'is' again,'' Logan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no elegant way to say I was fired. You in the media  
have more elegant ways: sacked, axed, ousted. Stuart Subotnick 
allowed me the prerogative to resign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No team has folded or been moved since the MLS began play in  
1996, and Logan oversaw its expansion to Chicago and Miami, 
bringing the league to 12 teams. 
</P>
<P>
	However, flat television ratings have plagued the league since  
the beginning of its second year, and it is still well below the 
average crowd of 17,406 it achieved in its first season. Some team 
officials had grumbled privately about Logan, particularly 
following his dismissal of deputy commissioner Sunil Gulati in 
February.

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Brad Paisley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Brad Paisley, dark and handsome, was on  
stage singing about lost love to the adoring women of the Wildhorse 
Saloon. 
</P>
<P>
	A guy standing on the dance floor with his enraptured girl  
friend was a little drunk and a lot jealous as he pointed to the 
electrifying singer who had snared the young woman's attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's so miserable, why doesn't he go kill himself?'' said  
the drunk, spilling beer as he motioned to Paisley. 
</P>
<P>
	But Paisley, basking in the approval of his female fans, didn't  
seem to notice the guy. Nor did the drunk's companion or the rest 
of the audience at the spacious, faux honky-tonk in downtown 
Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	The women especially were loving Paisley, who alternated  
lovelorn ballads with witty, fast-paced tunes about -- well, being 
lovelorn. And when he stormed the edges of the stage during 
fleet-fingered guitar solos, the men cheered, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you think I'll just forget you and decide that I don't love  
you/Do you realize what you're tellin' me to do?'' he sang. ``It's 
like saying don't breathe or don't blink/ ... See I just can't turn 
this off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The drunk shuffled off to the bar to console himself with  
another beer, as his companion shoved through the dance floor to 
get closer to the stage and to Paisley, who has emerged this summer 
as THE breakout country music star of 1999. Only neo-Outlaw duo 
Montgomery-Gentry, ``Ordinary Life'' singer Chad Brock and the band 
Lonestar rival him. 
</P>
<P>
	Paisley is a clever songwriter, effective singer and  
accomplished guitarist in the league of Ricky Skaggs or Steve 
Wariner. He's wholesome without being preachy -- the first song on 
his debut album, ``Who Needs Pictures,'' is about cooling your 
heels in church during a long sermon while itching to go fishing. 
</P>
<P>
	The single, also called ``Who Needs Pictures,'' is selling about  
2,500 copies a week, putting it at No. 9 on the country charts, 
just ahead of Montgomery-Gentry's ``Hillbilly Shoes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Remember, you heard it here first,'' said Naomi Judd when  
Paisley was a recent guest on ``Heart to Heart With Naomi Judd,'' 
her syndicated radio show. ``What we have here is a star. And all 
you girls, he's 26 and real easy on the eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moments earlier, Paisley had moved Judd to tears performing his  
song, ``He Didn't Have to Be,'' about a grateful stepson thanking 
the man who married his mother. The song was inspired by the 
relationship his co-writer Kelly Loveless has with his stepson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do a great song and people notice it,'' Paisley said,  
explaining how the Wildhorse crowd knew the words to ``He Didn't 
Have to Be'' well enough to sing along, even though it hasn't been 
issued as a single yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Paisley, who is from Glen Dale, W.Va., learned the basics of  
country music at the knee of his grandfather, Warren Jarvis, an 
amateur guitar picker. As a child, Jarvis looked after Paisley each 
morning before school when Paisley's parents -- his mother is a 
teacher and father works for the West Virginia Department of 
Highways -- went to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarvis bought Paisley his first guitar, a Sears Dancelctro  
Silvertone, when he was 8. Paisley learned to play standards like 
``Wildwood Flower'' from Jarvis, and first sang in church at 10. 
Jarvis died of cancer a few years ago, but not before seeing his 
protege open for The Judds. The ``Who Needs Pictures'' CD is 
dedicated to him. 
</P>
<P>
	In West Virginia, the most prominent country music radio show is  
Jamboree USA on WWVA in Wheeling. The 66-year-old program is the 
second-oldest radio show to the Grand Ole Opry on Nashville's WSM. 
Paisley played it at 12, and was a regular for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doing the Jamboree ... is THE thing that made me who I am,''  
said Paisley, who recently opened for Loretta Lynn in New York City 
and will do the same for Merle Haggard in Nashville. ``That whole 
experience of every Saturday night, getting to open for people as 
legendary as George Jones and Roy Clark. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``You learn real quick what's dying on stage when you say it,''  
he said. ``It gave me a sense of entertainment value for a show as 
opposed to just wanting to sing and trying to imitate people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After two years at West Liberty State College, Paisley had done  
everything he could as a performer in his hometown. A college 
adviser urged him to transfer to Belmont University, which is 
within walking distance of Nashville's Music Row, the center of the 
country music industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had classes called Record Company Operations, and  
Recording Industry 101 and things like that -- Publishing, copyright 
law, stuff I had always wondered about,'' said Paisley, who majored 
in business. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got college credit to learn all that, and they were going to  
let me go and walk into Atlantic Records every day and work there 
for free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paisley was an intern at Atlantic Records, as well as a music  
management firm and ASCAP, where contacts helped him get a contract 
to write songs for a music publishing company and then a record 
deal with Arista. 
</P>
<P>
	Paisley's experience has made him a confident performer.  
</P>
<P>
	``Are there any single people out there?'' Paisley said to  
whoops from the audience at the Wildhorse. ``Well, I'm single, too 
-- and I HATE it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That set up ``Me Neither,'' Paisley's sly take on approaching  
women in bars, then trying to save face when they turn him town. 
Then he ripped through a guitar solo worthy of his greatest 
inspiration on the instrument -- Skaggs. 
</P>
<P>
	Paisley quieted the crowd by making his last encore a gospel  
song, ``In the Garden.'' It is also the last song on his CD. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time he finished, the drunk was a lot happier, swaying  
arm-in-arm with his girlfriend. ``At first I hated him,'' the man 
said his companion about Paisley. ``But he's all right.''

<HEADLINE> TV Star in Real-Life Rescue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WRIGHTSVILLE BEACH, N.C. (AP) -- Reality provided a little more  
excitement than his usual TV fiction for ``Dawson's Creek'' actor 
Joshua Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor, who plays Pacey Witter on the series on the WB  
network, and a friend saw two young women who had gotten into 
distress while swimming along the shore near Wrightsville Beach on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, 21, and his unidentified friend dove into the ocean and  
swam out to help the young women, who were floating near the rock 
jetty that separates Masonboro Inlet from the Atlantic Ocean, said 
Coast Guard Petty Officer Jody Howey. 
</P>
<P>
	But when they reached the pair, waves swept them all over the  
jetty and into the inlet, and then the current of the falling tide 
prevented them from getting back to shore, Howey said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Coast Guard boat rescued all four about 7 p.m. and no one was  
injured, Howey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson ``kept them safe and floating until the Coast Guard got  
there. He just helped out somebody who needed it,'' said David 
Hartley, producer of the show filmed in nearby Wilmington 
</P>
<P>
	The young women, who were not identified, were not involved with  
the television show, Hartley said.

<HEADLINE> China Warns U.S. on Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China warned the U.S. Congress today against  
backing any move by Taiwan toward independence, saying Beijing was 
ready to pay ``any price'' to defend China's claim to the island. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning came amid renewed tensions between China and Taiwan  
sparked by Taiwan President Lee-Teng-hui's insistence that the two 
sides should deal with each other as one state to another. 
</P>
<P>
	China regarded Lee's July 9 remarks as a move toward  
independence for Taiwan, which has ruled itself separately from 
Beijing since the two sides split in 1949 in a civil war. China 
views the island as a renegade province and has threatened to use 
force to stop it from formally declaring independence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will defend the state sovereignty and territorial integrity  
of our motherland at any price,'' the official Xinhua News Agency 
quoted a senior legislator as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The report did not identify him, other than saying he was a  
senior member of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chinese 
legislature, the National People's Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The official also accused Rep. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and other  
House members of inflaming tensions between China and Taiwan by 
introducing a bill that ``bluntly advocated'' independence for 
Taiwan, Xinhua said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, introduced July 29 to the House Committee on  
International Relations, will ``gravely damage peace and stability 
in the Asia-Pacific region, as well as the relations between China 
and the United States,'' the legislator was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	He appealed to Congress to shelve the bill.  
</P>
<P>
	In Taiwan today, Defense Minister Tang Fei said the island's  
armed forces will be tough but restrained amid increased military 
activity over the Taiwan Strait. 
</P>
<P>
	Tang did not comment directly on reports of stepped up sorties  
by planes and ships from both sides. But he said the strait is in 
international waters and Taiwan's key interest is ensuring safe 
usage for civilian aviation and shipping. 
</P>
<P>
	``We follow international law and are extremely self-disciplined  
in the spirit and in the means we use to handle these matters,'' 
Tang said. ``We don't wish to see any provocation but will do what 
is necessary'' to ensure national security. 
</P>
<P>
	Ministry spokesman Kung Fan-ding told the TVBS cable news  
network that military activity in the strait has been ``more than 
normal,'' but added that July and August have traditionally been 
the high season for Chinese training due to optimum weather 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Military observers say Taiwan's air force has increased patrols  
in the strait and navy sailors say they have been placed on a 
greater state of readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	Kung denied reports that Chinese military planes and ships have  
crossed the strait's center line, a hazy boundary that the two 
sides generally respect as the limit of their military activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government said Tuesday it was concerned increased  
sorties by China and Taiwan over the waterway could lead to 
accidents and advised both sides against anything that would 
heighten tensions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a pick up of activity by both sides,'' said  
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon. ``We urge both sides to show 
restraint.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Promises To Veto Tax Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today promised to veto a  
Republican plan that would lower the tax rate of every American who 
pays income tax. He called the bill ``risky and plainly wrong for 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-year, $792 billion tax cut package put together by House  
and Senate Republicans would gradually cut 1 percentage point off 
each personal income tax rate. It also would provide relief from 
the so-called marriage penalty, cut the individual capital-gains 
tax rate and eventually eliminate the estate tax. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they conclude this plan and send it to me,'' Clinton said,  
``I will have to veto it. I will refuse to sign any plan that signs 
away our commitment to America's future, Social Security, Medicare, 
paying down the debt.'' Speaking with reporters in the Rose Garden, 
Clinton said the GOP formula would jeopardize the economic success 
the nation has enjoyed under his administration and ``revert to one 
that is a proven failure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with the start of the August vacation at the end of the  
week, negotiators moved with unusual speed over two days of talks 
to resolve differences in the House and Senate bills, each of which 
totaled $792 billion in cuts but differed substantially in details. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and House Speaker  
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., were actively involved in the negotiations, 
while Democrats, who overwhelmingly opposed the GOP plans, were 
shut out of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republicans have sequestered themselves in a room in order  
to piece together a political bill they know is going nowhere,'' 
said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., ranking Democrat on the Ways and 
Means panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House brushed off warnings by Lott and House Majority  
Leader Dick Armey that prospects are dimming that Congress and 
Clinton can agree on a tax bill this year. ``The remarks sound like 
two leaders in a sandbox,'' presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart 
said. ``If they don't get their way, they don't want to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the GOP tax numbers ``just don't add up. It's pretty  
clear the Republican leadership is interested in making a political 
statement.'' And he countered a question about the political 
consequences of vetoing a tax cut with assurances that voters are 
cognizant of the administration's economic record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Others will handicap the risks of what the president is going  
to do, but he's going to do it because it's the right thing for the 
public,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said repeatedly that he will veto the GOP bill  
because he says the tax cut would use up almost all of the 
projected non-Social Security surplus over the next decade, leaving 
almost nothing for needed government programs and paying down the 
national debt. Clinton and most Democrats have said that any cut 
over $300 billion would be unacceptably risky to the nation's 
economic future. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans insist they can return the money to the taxpayers  
that rightfully belongs to them and still have enough to save 
Social Security and Medicare and pay down part of the national 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the GOP plan, each of the five tax brackets would go down  
by 1 percentage point. The lowest 15 percent tax bracket would fall 
to 14 percent in 2001, and the highest 39.6 percent bracket would 
become 38.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The House-passed bill included a 10 percent across-the-board tax  
cut, which was strongly criticized by the White House and Democrats 
as disproportionately favoring wealthy taxpayers. The 1 percentage 
point cut would give taxpayers in the 15 percent bracket a 7 
percent cut, better than that in the higher brackets. 
</P>
<P>
	To alleviate the marriage penalty, under which some married  
couples pay more in taxes than if they were single because their 
combined income moves them into a higher bracket, the Republican 
bill would gradually raise the standard deduction for couples until 
it is double the level permitted for individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, it would widen the current 15 percent bracket for  
couples so it would apply to some income that currently is taxed at 
28 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	There would be no cuts in the corporate capital gains tax, but  
personal capital gains taxes would be reduced from 20 percent to 18 
percent on some gains and 10 percent to 8 percent on others -- and 
adjusted annually for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance  
Committee, said contribution limits to individual retirement 
accounts would rise gradually from $2,000 to $5,000 annually. He 
said the self-employed would be permitted to deduct the entire cost 
of their health insurance premiums. Other officials said medical 
savings accounts, tax-deductible accounts set aside for 
health-related costs, would be more readily available. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP leadership planned to bring the bill before the House on  
Thursday and the Senate on Friday, securing passage before the 
August recess begins. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it would not be sent to the president until after  
Congress returned to work in September, giving supporters the 
chance to return home and tout the bill's benefits to their 
constituents. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans ``would like to take our message to the American  
people,'' Lott said. ``Maybe the president will conclude at some 
point that he needs to work with us.''

<HEADLINE> Stanford Buys Steinbeck Stories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Stanford University has bought an array  
of papers by the late author John Steinbeck, including previously 
unknown short stories and poems from his teens and twenties. 
</P>
<P>
	The university bought the collection from his sister, Esther  
Steinbeck Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is especially revealing of both Steinbeck's apprentice  
years, before his first novel in 1929, and of his life in the 1950s 
and 1960s, when literary success had made him a major public 
figure,'' said William McPheron, the university's curator for 
British and American literature. 
</P>
<P>
	The collection includes a draft of Steinbeck's speech accepting  
the 1962 Nobel prize in literature. Also included are hundreds of 
family photos and nearly 400 of Steinbeck's letters to his parents, 
sisters and other relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbeck was born in Salinas in 1902 and graduated from high  
school there. He studied English at Stanford but dropped out, 
working as a sales clerk, farm laborer, ranch hand and factory 
worker. 
</P>
<P>
	He novels include ``Of Mice and Men,'' ``Grapes of Wrath,''  
``The Red Pony,'' and ``East of Eden.''

<HEADLINE> Hatchet Wielder Dies After Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (AP) -- A hatchet-wielding man was pursued by  
police through downtown and later died, apparently from wounds 
suffered when he cut himself on a broken window during the chase. 
</P>
<P>
	David Pollack, 46, died at a hospital Tuesday, the day after he  
was injured in a confrontation that began when he was spotted 
waving a small hatchet near a downtown bus depot, police Sgt. Glen 
Grundeis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to get away Pollack used the hatchet to break into a  
closed business, Grundeis said. When officers followed him inside, 
Pollack threw a piece of computer equipment at them, then crashed 
through a second-story window and landed on an adjacent rooftop, 
breaking and severely lacerating his arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollack stayed on the roof for a time, pacing back and forth and  
waved the hatchet as blood poured from his wounds. He yelled at 
officers, police Lt. Bryan Lynn said, describing his behavior as 
``crazed, deranged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two officers wrestled with Pollack, but he broke free and slid  
down the roof, falling to the ground. Police then shot him with 
non-lethal bean bags, but ``they didn't have much effect on him,'' 
Grundeis said. ``He didn't really slow down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the man led police on a brief chase before collapsing.  
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy had not been performed as of early today, and the  
exact cause of death was not available. 
</P>
<P>
	``He probably just went into shock from loss of blood,''  
Grundeis said. ``He was unconscious when he was arrested.'' Police 
estimated the whole confrontation lasted about 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The man's motives were under investigation.  
</P>
<P>
	Grundeis said Pollack suffered no injuries at the hands of  
officers.

<HEADLINE> Diana Krall: Songs of Love </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As a headliner at major jazz festivals, Diana  
Krall is cool, composed and in command. But the pianist-singer 
admits to a brief bout of stage fright just before performing at 
last summer's Lilith Fair tour in her native British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were thousands of people, and I went to my manager and  
said, `What am I going to do? They're not going to like us. We're 
going to get killed out here,''' she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	``And he looked at me and said, `Diana, the most important thing  
is your music. ... Just play the music the way you do.' ... So we 
went up and just did our set like we would do at any jazz club, and 
it was great. I think it opened people up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krall has remained true to her jazz roots while appealing to a  
wider mainstream audience. Her two latest albums, ``All for You'' 
and ``Love Scenes'' (GRP-Impulse!), each received Grammy 
nominations. Both remained on Billboard's top traditional jazz 
chart for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Her new album, ``When I Look in Your Eyes,'' builds on her  
recent success. 
</P>
<P>
	``If what you're doing has integrity, then it doesn't matter  
what the venue is. ... as long as the music is treated with 
respect,'' the 34-year-old Krall said in a telephone interview. ``I 
won't do anything that compromises that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krall has been popping up in other unlikely places: performing  
at the nightclub on television's ``Melrose Place''; playing piano 
behind Celine Dion on the pop singer's Christmas album; and 
appearing on the Chieftains' latest record of traditional Irish 
tunes. 
</P>
<P>
	She had a cameo in the Val Kilmer-Mira Sorvino film ``At First  
Sight''; delivered the closing title tune, ``Why Should I Care,'' 
for Clint Eastwood's ``True Crime''; and is featured on the 
soundtrack for Harrison Ford's upcoming film ``Random Hearts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krall, who is warm and considerate in conversation, can seem  
detached onstage, absorbed in her piano. But it's more a case of 
shyness than aloofness. She couldn't imagine giving up the piano to 
concentrate on singing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very shy. ... and have never been comfortable standing up  
front holding a microphone. I tend to oversing when I'm not playing 
the piano,'' she said. ``I don't find playing the piano 
distracting. I think I sing better when I'm accompanying myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her photogenic cool blond beauty has led some writers to compare  
her to past and present Hollywood stars -- from Grace Kelly to 
Sharon Stone. But given her admitted shyness, an acting career is 
out for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Krall finds herself resisting the siren call of pop  
music stardom. She wants crossover success, but on her own terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went into music because I love music and I was hoping I  
would get a gig,'' she said. ``Now I'm kind of popular, so I'm 
getting asked questions whether or not I'm going to become pop. ... 
I'm so busy touring and working, that right now I'm just worried 
about playing. The music is more important than anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While growing up in Nanaimo, British Columbia, Krall was exposed  
to jazz by her accountant father, who played piano and had a big 
collection of vintage records. 
</P>
<P>
	Her first musical inspiration was pianist-vocalist Fats Waller,  
whose artistry was sometimes overlooked, Krall said, because of the 
humor in his music. In the Waller tradition, Krall's repertoire 
features some naughty novelty songs to lighten the mood, including 
her signature song, ``Peel Me a Grape,'' and ``Popsicle Toes,'' a 
ditty about being in the nude. 
</P>
<P>
	She has absorbed some unlikely non-musical influences into her  
style. She kept a poster of comedian Jack Benny in her room, 
admiring him for ``his use of silence.'' She enjoyed the poetry of 
e.e. cummings ``because of the simplicity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 15, Krall was hired to play piano on weekends at a Nanaimo  
lounge. A scholarship from the Vancouver Jazz Festival allowed her 
to study music in Boston. When she returned to British Columbia, 
bassist Ray Brown heard her at a club and became a mentor, 
encouraging her to go to Los Angeles in the 1980s, where she used a 
Canadian government grant to study with pianist-vocalist Jimmy 
Rowles. 
</P>
<P>
	Rowles, best known as an accompanist to Peggy Lee, Billie  
Holiday, Sarah Vaughan and Ella Fitzgerald, encouraged her to sing 
in public and broadened her repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I approach things similar to how he taught me,'' said Krall.  
``He loved beauty and kept talking to me about that; don't forget 
about beauty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After honing her craft in Canada and Europe, Krall moved to New  
York in 1990. Her major label debut came in 1994 with ``Only Trust 
Your Heart'' for GRP. 
</P>
<P>
	Her breakthrough came with her third album, ``All for You''  
(1996), a swinging tribute to the jazz piano trio led by Nat King 
Cole in the 1940s before he concentrated on a career as a pop 
vocalist. 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, Krall released ``Love Scenes,'' which she  
described as a collection of standards expressing hurt, melancholy, 
naughtiness, silliness and other elements of love. 
</P>
<P>
	Krall admits she was ``overwhelmed and a bit intimidated at  
first'' when Johnny Mandel approached her about doing a record. 
</P>
<P>
	She prepared for the session by listening to Mandel's ``Ring a  
Ding Ding!'' recording with Frank Sinatra; the Nat King Cole-George 
Shearing album with strings; and Joao Gilberto's ``Amoroso,'' with 
Brazilian-flavored American standards. 
</P>
<P>
	On her new album, Krall acknowledges this Brazilian influence  
with silky smooth bossa nova versions of ``Let's Face the Music and 
Dance'' and ``I've Got You Under My Skin.'' The title track, Leslie 
Bricusse's ``When I Look in Your Eyes,'' is from the 1967 film 
score of ``Dr. Dolittle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new album gives Krall a rich musical palette to work with.  
There are quartets with drummer Jeff Hamilton, and the strings act 
as another instrument on the eight tracks with orchestra arranged 
and conducted by Mandel. 
</P>
<P>
	Krall's piano plays a less prominent role than on her previous  
albums and she has put more emphasis on her vocals. Still, she 
admits to limitations as a jazz singer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at myself more as a storyteller kind of singer rather  
than a jazz singer. ... The lyric is really important for me. It 
has to be very strong and timeless. ... I'm approaching the piano 
definitely as a jazz player, and that's where I do more 
improvising. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worked really hard on my vocals on this record ... and feel  
a little more confident. I think I know what I want and I'm still 
striving for that. It's not finished yet.''

<HEADLINE> Don Garber Named MLS Commissioner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Major League Soccer has a new commissioner, and he comes from a  
branch of the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Garber, who had been senior vice president of the NFL's  
international division, was introduced today in New York as the 
successor to Doug Logan, who was removed after serving as the 
league's only commissioner since it started in April 1996. Logan's 
contract ran through next season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old Garber will oversee all business operations of  
the 12-team MLS. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked for the NFL for 15 years. During the last three, he  
was in charge of the league's business ventures outside the United 
States, including television production and right distribution and 
various marketing and fan development activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Before taking over as head of NFL International, Garber was vice  
president of business development and special events for NFL 
properties, the league's marketing arm. 
</P>
<P>
	The MSL has failed to live up to expectations of its backers and  
Logan apparently was blamed. 
</P>
<P>
	He had predicted a 15 percent increase in average attendance  
from the league's first year to the second. But attendance actually 
fell from 17,406 to 14,619, a 16 percent drop. 
</P>
<P>
	It further fell to 14,312 last season, but has rebounded to  
15,174 through this past weekend's games. 
</P>
<P>
	MLS operates under a ``single-entity'' concept in which  
companies invest in the league and receive the rights to operate a 
club. The league contracts with all the players, assigns the major 
stars to clubs in the name of competitive balance and gate 
attraction, and pays them from a central fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the salaries the league negotiates with the players,  
each team must stay under a $1.7 million salary cap.

<HEADLINE> Kings Sign Funderburke, Martin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The Sacramento Kings re-signed forward  
Lawrence Funderburke on Wednesday and picked up point guard Darrick 
Martin, a free agent from the Los Angeles Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are solidifying the depth of our team with relatively young  
players who have proven productivity in this league,'' said Geoff 
Petrie, the team's vice president of basketball operations. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Kings acquired shooting guard Nick Anderson from  
Orlando in exchange for guard Tariq Abdul-Wahid and a future No. 1 
pick. The team has already re-signed two of its free agents, guard 
Jon Barry and forward-center Scot Pollard, and is expected to 
re-sign forward Corliss Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
	Funderburke, 28, averaged 9.2 points and 4.6 rebounds over his  
two-year NBA career with the Kings. Last season, the 6-foot-9 
forward shot a team-leading 55.9 percent from the field while 
averaging 8.9 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a second-round pick out of Ohio State in the 1994 NBA  
draft, then played three professional seasons in Europe before 
signing with the Kings for the 1997-98 season. 
</P>
<P>
	A five-year NBA veteran, Martin has averaged 9.2 points, 4.0  
assists, and 1.6 rebounds with the Los Angeles Clippers, Minnesota 
Timberwolves, and Vancouver Grizzlies. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, 29, averaged 8.0 points and 3.9 assists for the Clippers  
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Darrick provides us with an experienced point guard who has  
started a number of games over his NBA career,'' Petrie said. 
``Along with Jason Williams, Darrick solidifies our situation at 
point guard, which was a position this offseason we wanted to 
address.''

<HEADLINE> Nev. Brothels Will Be Shut Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIRGINIA CITY, Nev. (AP) -- By this time next week, two of the  
three brothels in Storey County will be padlocked, the ladies gone 
and the keys in the hands of federal agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Area church leaders and others aren't shedding any tears over  
the closure of the bordellos at the infamous Mustang Ranch, shut 
down after a jury convicted the owners and a former county official 
of fraud, racketeering and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the county commissioners fear they may have to cut  
services or boost taxes to make up for the lost business. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have been a very good neighbor to us. They've donated  
thousands of dollars to the county. It's a great loss,'' said Carl 
Trink, the vice chairman of the county commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Brothels have long been legal in 12 of Nevada's 17 counties,  
including Storey County, outside of Reno. The Mustang Ranch is 
perhaps the most celebrated of them all. 
</P>
<P>
	The gaudy 104-room bordello, located on a sprawling 440-acre  
ranch, first made headlines in 1955, when it was opened by Joe 
Conforte during a time when prostitution was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1971, the Mustang Ranch became the state's first legal  
brothel and led to the movement that resulted in legalized 
prostitution in parts of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Conforte's tax problems led to its closure in 1990, and the IRS  
seized control of it. It was supposedly taken over by new ownership 
-- A.G.E. Corp. -- in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	But last month, a federal grand jury convicted the owners and  
Shirely Colletti, a former Mustang madam and former county 
commissioner. Jurors said they concealed the fact that Conforte, on 
the lam in South America, was using A.G.E. as a front to hide his 
illegal ownership of the businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge ordered federal agents to seize control of the property  
on Monday. With the closure of the Mustang Ranch, there will only 
be one brothel left in Storey County. 
</P>
<P>
	Local officials are fretting about how to make up the loss in  
revenue in their $4 million budget. They collected more than 
$200,000 every year through brothel, liquor and boarding house 
licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``With a county budget as small as Storey County's, I don't  
think we can afford to lose a minimum of $230,000,'' Commission 
Chairman Charles Haynes said Tuesday. ``It could be as much as 
1/16th of our entire county budget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others are wondering if the shutdown of the ranch will be the  
end of prostitution in the county. The third brothel, the Old 
Bridge Ranch, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and has been 
targeted for closure by officials in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been a lot of speculation as to what the future of  
prostitution in Storey County will be,'' Haynes said. 
</P>
<P>
	If prostitution is in danger of ending in Storey County, Barbara  
Jones won't be disappointed. The Reno resident has appealed to the 
commission to outlaw the brothels. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to see this be the beginning of the end of the  
brothels and turn around our reputation in Nevada,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	But George Flint, lobbyist for the 32-member Nevada Brothel  
Owners Association, said potential buyers are lining up in 
anticipation of a chance to get the brothels back from the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe you might end up two years from now with five  
brothels instead of three,'' Flint said. ``I've had 27, maybe 30 
calls and visits from viable entities from inside and outside the 
state who have showed an interest to get in the business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lars Pedersen, a pawn broker in Wendover, and Regina Winters, a  
former prostitute and brothel manager, are among those who see 
themselves as potential new owners of the Mustang Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're interested in buying the license and moving the building  
to another place,'' Winters said. ``I've been in the brothel 
business a long time, as a working girl myself and as a manager.''

<HEADLINE> American Alters Frequent Flier Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Frequent flier miles with American  
Airlines will last indefinitely as long as passengers use their 
accounts every three years, the air carrier announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	That means the 35 million people enrolled in American's  
AAdvantage program may not ever see mileage expire as long as they 
continue to accrue or use points. 
</P>
<P>
	``All you really have to do is have some activity within 36  
months,'' said Henry Joyner, vice president of marketing for AMR 
Corp., the parent company of American. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, frequent flier miles had a shelf life of about three  
years, depending on the program. 
</P>
<P>
	American's easily has double the number of participants in its  
frequent flier program than other airlines. The Fort Worth, 
Texas-based airline had $695 million worth of flights outstanding 
at the end of 1998. Only an average of about 10 percent of seats 
per flight are available for redemption through frequent flier 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point it's not clear we need to increase seats,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joyner said the airline's partnerships with about 20 other  
airlines will give fliers more choices. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real change will be the attractiveness of international  
flights,'' said Joyner. 
</P>
<P>
	American's decision follows Northwest Airlines similar  
announcement in January. Delta Air Lines had dropped most of its 
expiration requirements three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines remains the only major carrier that has  
expiration dates. 
</P>
<P>
	``United does have non-expiring rules with their elite  
programs,'' said Randy Peterson, editor of InsideFlyer magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone messages left with United were not immediately  
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Frequent flier programs have been a powerful tool for creating  
customer loyalty for the airlines. The miles are used as a virtual 
currency with the airlines redeemable for such things as plane 
tickets, travel packages and hotel stays. Over the last several 
years, program participants have been able to earn miles on the 
ground in almost endless ways. Phone companies, grocers, car rental 
agencies and credit cards offer miles.

	The way mileage is now accrued is partially why airlines are  
dropping their expiration dates. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in 1988 when frequent flier programs were introduced  
literally all mile accrual came from flying. Today, companies buy 
miles from the airlines to give to customers, making the programs 
lucrative for carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Close to half of miles today comes from other program  
activity,'' said Peterson. ``Essentially the airline is being 
prepaid for each seat.''

	WHAT MILLENNIUM?: Travel magazines have been full of stories  
about great locations for ushering in the year 2000, but it seems 
that most people will forgo that trip to Bali or the Himalayas and 
do their celebrating close to home. A survey sponsored by Travel 
Weekly, a trade newspaper, found that only 8 percent of the 405 
people queried have made travel arrangements for New Year's. 
Another 9 percent are still thinking about it. Among the most 
frequently cited reasons for staying home: There's plenty to do 
nearby, it's not possible to take a vacation at that time of the 
year, and ``The millennium means nothing to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	SOMETIMES THE FASTEST WAY TO GET THERE IS TO JUST HOOF IT: It's  
a universal image -- the overnight delivery van pulling up, and the 
driver jumping out and handing over eagerly-awaited packages and 
envelopes. But it's not always that simple when drivers have to 
navigate crowded streets -- sometimes they just have to get out and 
walk because that's the fastest way to get a package delivered. DHL 
Worldwide Express tried to determine in which cities around the 
world its employees had to do the most walking to get packages to 
their destinations, so it says it gave couriers pedometers and 
measured the average distance they walked on their routes. In 
Cairo, couriers walked the most, an average of 11 miles on a single 
route, DHL said. Madrid was in second place, with couriers walking 
an average of 7.7 miles, and No. 3 was central London, where 
couriers had to walk for 7.5 miles on a route. They walked the 
least in Amsterdam, averaging only 1.8 miles.

	SURFING RESTRICTIONS: With the Internet increasingly becoming a  
workplace tool, more companies are establishing formal policies 
about using Internet during work hours, reports Management 
Recruiters International, an employee search firm. The company says 
it surveyed more than 4,000 executives, and nearly two-thirds said 
their companies have a policy in place. Some policies limit how 
much time employees can use the Internet for their own use, and 
some prohibit personal use altogether. Nearly a third of the 
respondents said their firms have software that blocks employees 
from entering certain sites, such adult-oriented Web pages. And 
some of the companies have software that keep employees out of 
shopping Web sites and personal finance sites as well.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Advocates Make Sweet Pitch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer advocates are urging the government  
to change food labels to show how much sugar is natural to the food 
and how much was added in processing. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, food labels report a product's total sugar but don't  
say how much of it was added, Michael Jacobson of the Center for 
Science in the Public Interest said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	So his group and others petitioned the Food and Drug  
Administration to change food labeling requirements to add a line 
listing ``added sugar'' to show what percentage that is of a 
recommended daily amount. 
</P>
<P>
	FDA spokesman Emil Corwin said the agency had not yet received  
the petition. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Food Processors Association said the proposed  
change would merely confuse consumers, and the Grocery 
Manufacturers of America said the battle against obesity cannot be 
won by ``obsessively targeting'' sugar. 
</P>
<P>
	``American consumers already have all the tools they need to  
evaluate the nutritional quality of foods,'' Richard O. Keelor, 
president of the Sugar Association, said in a statement that called 
the change unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobson said the amount of added sugars in the American diet  
has been increasing steadily. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty years ago, Americans were getting about 12 percent of  
their calories from refined sugars, or added sugars,'' he said. 
``Today we're averaging about 16 percent. Teen-agers get 20 percent 
of their calories from added sugars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While he agreed that the body can't tell the difference between  
natural sugars and added sugars, Jacobson said the natural sugars 
come with other nutrients, including vitamins and fiber, while 
added sugars add only calories to the diet. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion Nestle, a nutritionist at New York University, said the  
increased consumption of soft drinks and other sweetened beverages 
replaces more healthful items such as milk and fruit juice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like sweet foods, and I do not for a minute believe that  
sugars are poison,'' she said. But, she added, ``rates of obesity 
are rising among children as well as adults.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People would be healthier if they replaced foods high in added  
sugar with more nutritious foods,'' she said. ``Food labels are a 
good way to help people do this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Mohammad N. Akhter of the American Public Health Association  
said: ``Americans have done wonderful work in modifying their 
lifestyles. More people exercise today, more watch their diet. Once 
they have the information they will act on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobson said the Agriculture Department recommends that the  
average person on a 2,000-calorie daily diet include no more than 
40 grams of added sugar. That's about 10 teaspoonfuls, or the 
amount of sugar in a 12-ounce soft drink. 
</P>
<P>
	Under his proposal, for example, a product listing total sugars  
of 15 grams -- of which 5 grams occur naturally in the food -- would 
include a second line saying ``added sugar 10 grams, 25 percent'' 
of daily recommended intake. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal was sent Tuesday to the FDA, and Jacobson said the  
normal process of studying such recommendations, seeking public 
comment and changing the rule would probably take up to five years.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Affair Still Dogs Clintons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Call it the Grandma factor.  
</P>
<P>
	Beyond the usual suspects in a sexual fling like President  
Clinton's with Monica Lewinsky, the first lady suggested that her 
husband's impeachable conduct could be linked to childhood conflict 
between his mother and his grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
	Then she said she didn't mean it that way. And he said she'd  
made no excuses for conduct that was inexcusable. 
</P>
<P>
	Whenever the tale of two Clintons subsides, something happens to  
stir it again. In this case it was Hillary Rodham Clinton, who 
chose to address in a magazine interview the marital problems she'd 
earlier insisted belonged in a zone of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	That line will be hard to hold now on the ``listening tour'' in  
which she is readying a campaign for the Senate in New York. Her 
Talk Magazine interview became the prime topic of TV and radio talk 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
	One theory is that she was trying to pre-empt the question in  
order to shelve it as she seeks to succeed Sen. Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan, in a state where she's never lived or worked. But it had 
hardly come up in the month since she set up her Senate campaign 
exploratory committee and started her campaign travels. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said she would only succeed in stirring the issue,  
not solving it. 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, Mrs. Clinton's talk with Talk must rank as the  
oddest of candidate interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	In it, she seemed to deflect the blame for Clinton's marital  
infidelities with a venture into amateur psychology -- something she 
and the president dismissed and sometimes denounced when others 
tried it on them. 
</P>
<P>
	At the outset, when Clinton was dishonestly denying his affair  
with Monica Lewinsky, the first lady said a ``vast, right-wing 
conspiracy'' was trying to stir scandal against him. His cover 
stories and testimony were what got him impeached by the House. The 
Senate acquitted him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He couldn't protect me and so he lied,'' Mrs. Clinton told  
Talk writer Lucinda Franks. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, there was grandma, Edith Grisham Cassidy, and her  
bitter argument with Clinton's mother, Virginia, over her second 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was so young, barely four, when he was scarred by abuse  
that he can't even take it out and look at it,'' Mrs. Clinton said 
in the interview. ``There was a terrible conflict between his 
mother and grandmother. A psychologist once told me that for a boy, 
being in the middle of a conflict between two women is the worst 
possible situation. There is always the desire to please each 
one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's spokesman said that the president takes responsibility  
for his own actions, and that he was comfortable with his wife's 
account. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently she was not, at least with the way it was  
interpreted. So two days after it was published, her spokeswoman, 
Marsha Berry, said it was being misinterpreted as an excuse for his 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton didn't disavow what she'd said in interviews  
conducted last spring and published on Sunday. ``She did not say 
the president's childhood in any way caused his behavior, nor does 
she believe that,'' Ms. Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jamestown, N.Y., on Wednesday, the first lady did more  
fine-tuning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is responsible for their behavior and I am a very  
strong proponent and believer in personal responsibility, so I hope 
that people will take that message away from this,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said so, too. ``I don't believe that anybody could  
fairly read the article and think that she was making any excuses 
for me,'' he said at the White House. ``I have not made any excuses 
for what was inexcusable and neither has she, believe me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More questions, but no more answers. ``Look, I think that I have  
said all I need to say about that,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said she believed that the country had put the  
matter behind it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have as well,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Keeping it there in the clamor of a New York Senate campaign  
will not be easy. 
</P>
<P>
	But at least Grandma Cassidy is off the hook.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> House Votes To Ease Legal Aid Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Wednesday to ease proposed  
cuts in legal aid for the poor as Democrats and moderate 
Republicans overcame the latest conservative attack on the Legal 
Services Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	By 242-178, the House agreed to provide $250 million next year  
for the corporation instead of the $141 million the House 
Appropriations Committee had proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The total would still fall short of the $300 million provided  
for Legal Services this year. But with President Clinton having 
requested $340 million for fiscal 2000 and the Senate having 
already voted for $300 million, the final figure is likely to grow. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old, nonprofit corporation receives federal and  
private aid and distributes grants to local boards of lawyers, who 
then provide free legal assistance to low-income people in civil 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal Services is an annual target of conservatives. But this  
year, opponents received added ammunition when the General 
Accounting Office, Congress' official auditor, concluded that five 
of the corporation's local offices had counted 75,000 cases in 1997 
that they couldn't document. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said Legal Services  
would ``inflate their statistical data for the purposes of getting 
more'' federal money. 
</P>
<P>
	``This debate is all about integrity,'' said Rep. Tom Latham,  
R-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	But Legal Services supporters said the errors were a result of  
nothing more than bad record-keeping. They accused opponents of 
looking for new reasons for their age-old dislike for the 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you believe in family values, let's protect some of these  
poor and middle-class people who can't afford to protect their 
families,'' said Rep. Carrie Meek, D-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's not shut the courthouse door to poor people,'' said Rep.  
James Ramsted, R-Minn. ``Let's not give the most vulnerable 
Americans the heave-ho.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The added $109 million, which was sponsored by Rep. Jose  
Serrano, D-N.Y., and Ramstad, would be paid for by cuts scattered 
among the FBI, federal prisons and courts and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The amendment was supported by 198 Democrats, 43 Republicans and  
one independent. Five Democrats and 173 Republicans opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Legal Services funds were part of a $37.7 billion measure  
financing the departments of Justice, State and Commerce and 
smaller agencies for next year, which the House moved toward 
approving. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill faces a White House veto threat because the measure  
provides less than Clinton wants for legal aid, hiring local police 
officers, protecting endangered species and U.S. payments to 
international organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the bill falls about $2.7 billion below what Clinton  
proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, written largely by Republicans, includes nearly all  
of the $4.8 billion Clinton requested for the 2000 census. 
</P>
<P>
	But bowing to budget pressures, it declares $4.5 billion of it  
an emergency, exempting that money from spending limits and paying 
for it out of expected federal surpluses. Democrats mocked that 
designation of the constitutionally required head count, but lost a 
procedural attempt to block it by a near party-line 221-205. 
</P>
<P>
	With the start of fiscal 2000 less than two months away, passage  
would make the measure the 11th of the 13th annual spending bills 
for 2000 that the House has approved. The Senate has approved 
eight. 
</P>
<P>
	But so far, a House-Senate compromise version of only one of the  
bills has gotten final congressional approval, an $8.4 billion 
measure financing military construction. 
</P>
<P>
	In other spending action,  
</P>
<P>
	--The Senate approved $7.4 billion in emergency aid for farmers  
hurt by drought and low crop prices, then passed a $68 billion 
measure financing agriculture and food programs for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	--House-Senate bargainers approved a compromise bill providing  
the District of Columbia's local government with $429 million in 
federal aid and ordering it not to give needles to illegal drug 
users in an effort to fight AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	--House-Senate negotiators also agreed to a near $2.5 billion  
measure financing Congress' own operations.

<HEADLINE> Officer Speaks Out in Gender Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Air Force lieutenant who objects to working  
in the close quarters of a nuclear missile silo with women is 
protesting a decision to retrain and transfer him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love my church, I love being in the military, I love my  
wife, I love my child,'' 1st Lt. Ryan Berry told reporters 
Wednesday. ``I'm not being allowed to combine those loves. I have 
to sell one of them short.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berry, 26, who is stationed at Minot Air Force Base in North  
Dakota, complained last month that he was being disciplined by 
higher-ups for what he says are his strong Roman Catholic beliefs. 
He says those beliefs prevent him from being able to share such 
close quarters with a woman who is not his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Michael Ryan, the Air Force chief of staff, said in a  
letter to a group of congressmen released on Wednesday that he 
agreed the Air Force ``must accommodate religious beliefs to the 
maximum extent possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in Berry's case, it was decided that ``his personal  
convictions could no longer be accommodated without creating an 
unacceptable impact on the unit's ability to accomplish the 
military mission,'' Ryan wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will soon be scheduled for training to a new career field  
followed by an assignment to another installation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berry's case has generated support from various religious groups  
and conservative lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 West Point graduate now serving in the Air Force says  
he doesn't want to work with women in an area no bigger than a 
school bus, where the work day is usually 24 hours and there is 
only one bed available. 
</P>
<P>
	He has never done silo duty with a woman. But the Air Force  
signaled he would have to do so if he remained at Minot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never disobeyed any order,'' Berry said. ``I've just  
asked to have my religious beliefs respected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berry's wife, Jill, stood with him at the news conference on the  
Capitol grounds, holding their 6-month-old daughter, Juliana. 
</P>
<P>
	William Donohue, president of the Catholic League for Religious  
and Civil Rights, said Berry's problem in sharing close quarters 
with a woman ``is completely consistent with the Catholic faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he appreciates calls for more tolerance, particularly  
among women's groups, ``but where is the tolerance for him?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Hamilton, a lawyer representing Berry, said the letter  
from Ryan promising Berry a new career field ``is a vapid response. 
It's nonsense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He has been punished for what he thinks,'' Hamilton said.  
``He's been ostracized. ... If the Air Force persists in 
stigmatizing Lieutenant Berry as a malcontent, we will exhaust all 
administrative remedies and then we will bring suit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Roscoe Bartlett, R-Md., a member of the House Armed  
Services Committee, said the Air Force policy of putting men and 
women together in such proximity could easily lead to sexual 
misbehavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is silly. This policy is stupid, quite apart from the  
religious aspects of it,'' Bartlett said. He called it ``a case of 
worshipping at the altar of political correctness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an April job performance review, Col. Ronald Haeckel, Berry's  
commander, said his refusal to work with women was unacceptable and 
``adversely impacted good order, discipline and morale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berry was decertified from working with nuclear missiles. He now  
works elsewhere in Minot's missile wing.

<HEADLINE>  Suns Await Word on Hardaway Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Phoenix Suns waited not so patiently  
Wednesday for word from Orlando on whether the Magic would approve 
a sign-and-trade offer to bring Penny Hardaway to the desert. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's told us he wants to be here. We've finalized the  
contract, and now we're waiting for Orlando to pull the trigger,'' 
Suns president Jerry Colangelo said. 
</P>
<P>
	By Wednesday night, the deal still wasn't done, and there were  
indications that Orlando's management was trying mightily to 
salvage more out of the deal than the Suns were offering, either by 
persuading Hardaway to stay and play for new Magic coach Doc Rivers 
or by finding another interested trading partner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns' offer of Danny Manning, Pat Garrity and two draft  
picks appeared to be the only deal on the table as of Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge decision for us, obviously,'' said general manager  
John Gabriel, who has spent long hours in his office in talks with 
team personnel and Hardaway's representatives. ``I was in here 
until midnight with the coach trying to work this out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make the trade happen, Hardaway would sign a seven-year, $92  
million contract with Orlando, the largest allowed for a player 
with his experience under the NBA's collective bargaining 
agreement, then would be traded to Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be a major boost to the Suns, who endured a lackluster  
season this year and are handicapped in any efforts to improve by 
the new salary cap. The team used its new $2 million exception 
Wednesday to sign free agent forward Rodney Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	If Hardaway joins the Suns, he would team with Jason Kidd as one  
of the most formidable backcourts in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway, 28, has averaged 19 points per game in six NBA  
seasons, making the All-Star game four times. Nagging injuries have 
plagued him the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic might be tempted to thwart Hardaway by refusing to  
sign him and allowing him to enter the free-agent market, where he 
could only sign a six-year deal for significantly less money, and 
only Chicago, the Los Angeles Clippers and Toronto appear to have 
the salary cap room to meet his demands. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Gabriel said such a scenario would ``probably not''  
happen, leaving only a sign-and-trade or keeping Hardaway the 
remaining options. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway was in Phoenix last Friday and Saturday, met with team  
officials, and played golf with coach Danny Ainge. 
</P>
<P>
	According to The Tribune of Mesa, while Hardaway was in Phoenix,  
Colangelo presented him with a set of golf clubs in a purple golf 
bag with Hardaway's name and the Phoenix Suns' logo stitched into 
it. It's the kind of gesture Colangelo is known for in his 
successful attempts to attract athletes.

	The Los Angeles Lakers removed themselves from the Hardaway  
sweepstakes when they reached a seven-year, $30 million agreement 
with Derek Fisher.

<HEADLINE> Corn Growers Grinning Ear-to-Ear / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FARGO, N.D. (AP) -- Worries that a common petroleum-based  
gasoline additive is polluting the environment have ignited 
optimism among corn growers and ethanol producers in the Upper 
Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any doubt this could be very positive  
for everyone in our business,'' said Trevor Guthmiller, executive 
director of the Sioux Falls, S.D.-based American Coalition for 
Ethanol. ``And anything we can do to help create demand for the raw 
product is going to be good for the bottom line of the farmer, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of the Environmental Protection Agency has recommended  
the agency immediately begin ``substantial reductions'' of the 
gasoline additive MTBE because of evidence it contaminates 
groundwater. 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendations, some of which would require congressional  
approval, have not been acted on yet by the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
	MTBE -- short for methyl tertiary butyl ether -- is the most  
widely used additive. It is blended with gasoline to produce 
cleaner-burning, oxygenated fuel as required by the federal 
government in more than a dozen of the nation's most polluted 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
	But a study released last month indicated that MTBE is seeping  
into drinking water supplies across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	MTBE producers already are fighting the panel's recommendation  
to phase out use of the product over four years in favor of ethanol 
and other alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
	But few in the ethanol industry believe the arguments will be  
successful. And they already are beginning to prepare for what many 
believe will be a huge increase in the demand for ethanol. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everyone in the industry is excited about this,'' said  
Dwight Enockson, a Washburn-area farmer and member of the North 
Dakota Corn Utilization Council. ``If California alone had to 
switch from MTBE to ethanol, that alone would literally take nearly 
all the ethanol production in the U.S. right now to meet the 
demand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The potential effect for corn producers and ethanol producers  
is tremendous right now,'' added Mark Dillon, executive vice 
president of Golden Growers Cooperative, a North Dakota-based corn 
growers co-op. ``And the industry is working hard at the state and 
federal level to convince leaders that ethanol really is the 
leading alternative to MTBE.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guthmiller said early projections are that if ethanol were to  
replace MTBE, the new demand would use up an additional 240 million 
bushels to 300 million bushels of corn. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethanol adds about 30 cents to each bushel of corn, but ethanol  
supporters said that probably would double if ethanol replaces 
MTBE. Corn prices currently are at about $1.50 per bushel, their 
lowest in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``The immediate benefit would be much better corn prices for  
farmers,'' added David Kolsrud, vice chairman of Agri-Energy, a 
company that began operating an ethanol plant near the small town 
of Luverne, Minn., about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it would also provide an economic boon to rural areas like  
ours that build ethanol plants and that haven't really enjoyed the 
economic benefits the rest of the country seems to be enjoying,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethanol supporters know they still face hurdles. Ethanol costs  
considerably more to make than MTBE, and its production is almost 
completely restricted to the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	To be economically feasible and to meet the demand on the West  
Coast and in the Northeast, some production would need to shift to 
those areas, experts say.

<HEADLINE> The Education of QB McNown Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLATTEVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- The contract's been signed, Cade McNown  
is settled into his dorm room and the rounds of introductions are 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it's time to get the rookie quarterback caught up on  
everything he missed in the first 11 days of training camp. And the 
Chicago Bears have, oh, about zero time to get it done. Welcome to 
a crash course, NFL style. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since he missed those 16 practices, he's got to really work  
hard to catch up because you don't want to slow down for everybody 
else,'' offensive coordinator Gary Crowton said Wednesday. ``The 
object is to win. So it's not, `Let's slow down for Cade and not do 
anything offensively.' We can't be like that. He's just got to 
catch up, and he wants to and he's trying to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Getting a new player, especially a rookie, up to speed is never  
easy, but McNown's case is especially challenging. The Bears are 
using a new, wide-open offense that demands a lot from the 
quarterback, and all but two plays of the scheme have already been 
installed. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no apprentice year on the bench, either, like some other  
rookie quarterbacks get. Veteran Erik Kramer was released two days 
before camp began and Shane Matthews, who had been the No. 1, is 
already taking over holding duties for extra points, usually the 
domain of the No. 2 quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	So McNown spends his days either on the practice field or in  
meetings. On Tuesday, his first day at training camp, he spent 
about six hours in one-on-ones with quarterbacks coach John Shoop 
as well as meetings with the other three quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I go up and ask them questions all the time, and nobody's ever  
stiffed me,'' McNown said. 
</P>
<P>
	If he does have any spare time, it's off to the film room or a  
quiet corner so he can study his playbook. There's a little time 
left over to eat and sleep, but not much. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown did learn the basics of the offense during three  
offseason minicamps, but that's no comparison to training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's coming, it's just going to take time,'' Crowton said.  
``I'm just going to take it one practice at a time and try to push 
him as hard as we can without blowing a fuse. But I think people 
who are pushed hard can do very good things, and we're going to 
push him hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Take Wednesday. In just his second practice, McNown was thrown  
into blitz drills, in which the defense comes flying at him as soon 
as he gets the ball, hoping to sack him. He didn't pick up the 
blitz as fast as Matthews, but Crowton said that was to be 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made some good plays on that, but I also made a couple of  
mistakes,'' McNown said. ``I'm glad I finally got to face some of 
that stuff. It's starting to feel more like football than it was 
before, when I wasn't getting any pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNown has always been one of those overachievers who throws 15  
passes if he's asked to throw five, and his competitiveness is 
showing already. On Tuesday, coach Dick Jauron said he doubted if 
McNown would play in Saturday's exhibition opener against the 
Indianapolis Colts. 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours later, Jauron had changed his mind.  
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't making any promises Wednesday, but if McNown shows in  
the next couple of days that he can pick up blitzes better and 
handle defenses, he'll be on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he doesn't handle the blitz and he doesn't have it down, he  
could just get a clean shot on him and get hurt,'' Crowton said. 
``At the same token, we're discussing that we don't want him to get 
further behind by not playing. We want to make sure we give him 
every opportunity to get reps. This is an opportunity, but we've 
got to be smart about it.''

<HEADLINE> Sandeno Only U.S. Swim Winner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Freestyler Kaitlin Sandeno broke  
Canada's stranglehold on women's swimming at the Pan American Games 
Wednesday night, while the U.S. team set two ignominious records. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandeno, 16, from Lake Forest, Calif., one of the promising  
young members of the American team, won the women's 400-meter 
freestyle in a career-best 4 minutes, 10.74 seconds. Her time was 
just off the Pan Am record of 4:10.56 by Cynthia Woodhead in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first U.S. women's victory after five consecutive  
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandeno, nicknamed ``Energizer,'' showed her energy and strength  
in beating Janelle Atkinson of Jamaica, the runner-up at 4:10.83, 
and 400 individual medley champion Joanne Malar of Canada, third at 
4:12.64. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the last 25 meters, I was thinking about our team the whole 	
time,'' Sandeno said. ``Everyone was saying we had to get the first 
</P>
<P>
                         girls' gold medal. 	
</P>
<P>
	``And I was thinking, `C'mon guys, I am going to do it for you.'  
</P>
<P>
	``It was awesome.''  
</P>
<P>
	Sandeno had displayed her ability, durability and versatility at  
this year's spring nationals, winning the 400 individual medley, 
finishing second in the 800 and 1,500 freestyles and placing third 
in the 400 freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandeno's victory was the only one for the Americans in five  
events -- the third consecutive night they had that result. 
</P>
<P>
	The total of only three gold medals in 15 events so far marks a  
low point for the U.S. team and seven losses for the women also 
constitutes a record. 
</P>
<P>
	Never in Pan Am history had U.S. swimmers lost more than 10  
events at one games. Now, they have lost 12 with 17 events 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Never in Pan Am history had the women lost more than six events.  
Now, they have lost seven with eight left. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada added to its domination in the women's competition,  
winning two more golds, and Brazil took over the gold medal lead 
among the men with two victories for a total of three. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly Stefanyshyn shattered her Canadian record in the women's  
100-meter backstroke, winning at 1:02.14, beating 1996 Olympic 
champion Beth Botsford. 
</P>
<P>
	Denali Knapp of Davis, Calif., finished second at 1:02.45, with  
Botsford, of Timonium, Md., third at 1:02.48. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada also won the 400 freestyle relay at 3:45.07, with 200  
freestyle champion Jessica Deglau swimming the leadoff leg. The 
U.S. finished second at 3:45.72. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's victories came in the men's 100 freestyle and 200  
backstroke, both in Pan Am record time. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernando Scherer broke teammate Gustavo Borges' record in the  
freestyle, clocking 49.19, with Borges, the two-time defending 
champion, taking third at 50.10. Splitting the two Brazilians was 
Argentina's Jose Meolans (49.94) as Americans failed to get a 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second event in which the Americans were blanked. In  
all the previous Pan Am Games, U.S. swimmers had failed to medal in 
individual events only twice -- once each in 1951 and 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Tucker of Auburn, Ala., was fourth in the freestyle at  
50.15 and Dan Phillips of Colorado Spmrings, Colo., seventh at 
50.71. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonardo Costa won the backstroke at 1:59.33, .01 second under  
the previous record set by Rick Carey in 1983. Americans went 2-3, 
with Aaron Peirsol of Irvine, Calif., the runner-up at 1:59.77, 
followed by Dan Shevcik of Wilton, Conn., at 2:00.27. Both were 
personal bests. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the U.S. leads the medals table with 17, but only three  
golds. Canada has 14 medals, but eight golds.

<HEADLINE>  Chile Seeks Pinochet Clemency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Having failed to convince British judges  
that Gen. Augusto Pinochet must be freed under international law, 
Chile is now mounting an effort to have him sent home because of 
failing health. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet, who is being held in London on a Spanish warrant for  
alleged human rights abuses, is said to dislike the idea of seeking 
clemency. ``He entered Britain through the front door, and he wants 
to leave the same way,'' said his oldest son, also named Augusto. 
</P>
<P>
	After a recent meeting, Pinochet's former press secretary,  
Alejandro de la Carrera, quoted the former dictator as saying he 
wants ``to fight until the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, de la Carrera added, Pinochet also wants ``to return to  
Chile more than anything else'' and might accept an act of clemency 
in the end. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chilean government says it will attempt to win Pinochet's  
release for health reasons whether the 83-year-old general likes it 
or not. 
</P>
<P>
	``His opinion in this regard is irrelevant,'' said Defense  
Minister Edmundo Perez. ``It is not for the patient to write the 
prescription.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference last month in Rio de Janeiro, British  
Foreign Minister Robin Cook called on Chilean authorities to relay 
any evidence of Pinochet's health problems to Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last week, Chile's Foreign Ministry received a report from  
a British and a Chilean doctor who had examined Pinochet and 
concluded he had ``serious medical problems that could be 
life-threatening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet was arrested on Oct. 16 while in London for back  
surgery. A Spanish warrant charges him with human rights abuses 
allegedly committed by his security forces during his 17-year rule. 
An official Chilean report says 3,197 people disappeared or were 
killed after the coup he led in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	A hearing on Spain's extradition request is set for Sept. 27.  
Britain and Spain have said that any decision on clemency would be 
made only after a ruling on extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	Chile's current government has little sympathy for Pinochet, but  
has argued that his arrest is a violation of sovereignty and that 
any trial for offenses that occurred in Chile should be carried out 
in Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of his arrest has threatened to polarize Chile. A  
center-left coalition has led the government since Pinochet gave up 
power in 1990. Chilean conservatives, who represent about a third 
of the population, credit Pinochet with saving the country from 
communism when he toppled an elected Marxist president. 
</P>
<P>
	In their medical report, the Chilean and British doctors who  
examined Pinochet said the stress of prolonged detention was 
hampering the former dictator's recovery from back surgery and 
worsening his existing diabetes. It noted that Pinochet also 
suffers from arthritis in his left knee and uses a pacemaker. 
</P>
<P>
	The report concluded that Pinochet isn't ``capable of enduring  
the stress that his prolonged captivity or a long trial'' could 
pose.

<HEADLINE>  Suns Await Word on Hardaway Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Phoenix Suns waited not so patiently  
Wednesday for word from Orlando on whether the Magic would approve 
a sign-and-trade offer to bring Penny Hardaway to the desert. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's told us he wants to be here. We've finalized the  
contract, and now we're waiting for Orlando to pull the trigger,'' 
Suns president Jerry Colangelo said. 
</P>
<P>
	By Wednesday night, the deal still wasn't done, and there were  
indications that Orlando's management was trying mightily to 
salvage more out of the deal than the Suns were offering, either by 
persuading Hardaway to stay and play for new Magic coach Doc Rivers 
or by finding another interested trading partner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns' offer of Danny Manning, Pat Garrity and two draft  
picks appeared to be the only deal on the table as of Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge decision for us, obviously,'' said general manager  
John Gabriel, who has spent long hours in his office in talks with 
team personnel and Hardaway's representatives. ``I was in here 
until midnight with the coach trying to work this out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make the trade happen, Hardaway would sign a seven-year, $92  
million contract with Orlando, the largest allowed for a player 
with his experience under the NBA's collective bargaining 
agreement, then would be traded to Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be a major boost to the Suns, who endured a lackluster  
season this year and are handicapped in any efforts to improve by 
the new salary cap. The team used its new $2 million exception 
Wednesday to sign free agent forward Rodney Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	If Hardaway joins the Suns, he would team with Jason Kidd as one  
of the most formidable backcourts in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway, 28, has averaged 19 points per game in six NBA  
seasons, making the All-Star game four times. Nagging injuries have 
plagued him the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic might be tempted to thwart Hardaway by refusing to  
sign him and allowing him to enter the free-agent market, where he 
could only sign a six-year deal for significantly less money, and 
only Chicago, the Los Angeles Clippers and Toronto appear to have 
the salary cap room to meet his demands. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Gabriel said such a scenario would ``probably not''  
happen, leaving only a sign-and-trade or keeping Hardaway the 
remaining options. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway was in Phoenix last Friday and Saturday, met with team  
officials, and played golf with coach Danny Ainge. 
</P>
<P>
	According to The Tribune of Mesa, while Hardaway was in Phoenix,  
Colangelo presented him with a set of golf clubs in a purple golf 
bag with Hardaway's name and the Phoenix Suns' logo stitched into 
it. It's the kind of gesture Colangelo is known for in his 
successful attempts to attract athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Lakers removed themselves from the Hardaway  
sweepstakes when they reached a seven-year, $30 million agreement 
with Derek Fisher.

<HEADLINE> Injured Steelers' Dawson Practices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LATROBE, Pa. (AP) -- Dermontti Dawson obviously felt three to  
four weeks was much too long for an All-Pro center to rest his 
injured knee, even when games aren't being played. 
</P>
<P>
	Three to four days was more like it.  
</P>
<P>
	Only a day after the Pittsburgh Steelers' top offensive lineman  
was hampered by a bulky cast and predictions that he wouldn't 
practice for weeks, he strapped on a knee brace and snapped during 
blocking drills Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The consensus among his teammates: Dawson is remarkably brave or  
incredibly bored. 
</P>
<P>
	``From everything I've heard and everything I've witnessed since  
I've been here, he is the essence of what a football player should 
be,'' offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride said. ``He loves the 
game and he loves to play. Am I shocked? No, I'm not shocked by 
anything. He's physically tough and courageous and I know he wants 
to be out here. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope he's not doing anything foolish by being out here, but  
it's good to see him back. I'm not going to do anything to 
discourage him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Dawson cautiously lifted his injured knee onto a bus  
seat and rode 170 miles round trip just to watch the Steelers 
scrimmage the Washington Redskins, even though he couldn't play. 
</P>
<P>
	Usually, a star player such as Dawson would gladly welcome the  
opportunity to skip such a workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to be smart about it,'' said Dawson, who has never  
missed a game during an 11-year NFL career. ``I know it's only 
training camp, but my knee is important as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That made Dawson's decision to practice all the more surprising,  
if only because the Steelers still are a week away from their first 
exhibition game and five weeks away from their first regular season 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	But several days of inactivity clearly knocked Dawson off his  
routine, perhaps because he could never remember missing any 
significant practice time before.

to be giving me snaps, that feels pretty good.''

<HEADLINE> US, Israel Investing in Laser Weapon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and Israel have agreed to  
spend an additional $46.6 million to continue development of a 
one-of-a-kind laser weapon for use against short-range projectiles 
like the Katyusha rockets that Hezbollah forces fire into northern 
Israel from southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerda Sherrill, a spokeswoman at the U.S. Army Space and Missile  
Defense Command, said Wednesday the program has cost $130.8 million 
since it started in 1996. It ran into problems with schedule delays 
and cost overruns that forced a choice between halting the project 
or investing more. 
</P>
<P>
	The contractor for the Tactical High Energy Laser weapon is TRW  
Space and Electronics Group of Redondo Beach, Calif. The company 
threatened to quit the project last spring unless the government 
put more money into it. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract was modified in June, two months after TRW was  
supposed to have completed work. The modified contract calls for 
TRW to pay half of the additional development costs until it 
successfully shoots down a Katyusha rocket in flight during field 
testing at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. The U.S. and 
Israeli governments will pay the other half. After a successful 
shootdown, TRW will pay one-quarter of the remaining costs and the 
two governments will pay the rest.

<HEADLINE> Rams Sign Faulk to Seven-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Marshall Faulk signed a seven-year, $45.15  
million contract with the St. Louis Rams on Wednesday, and said his 
12-day holdout was not about money. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk said negotiations picked up momentum after he saw a TV  
report suggesting he wanted no part of the training camp grind he's 
missed in Macomb, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be there with them, I want to sweat with them, I  
want to cramp up with them,'' Faulk said. ``That's part of it. You 
pegged me wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flanked by agent Rocky Arceneaux at an afternoon news  
conference, Faulk signed the contract that makes him the 
highest-paid Rams player ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is by far the biggest contract in Rams history, and we  
really expect Marshall to make a significant contribution,'' team 
president John Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot of money,'' said Rams executive vice president Jay  
Zygmunt, who negotiated the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk, who has rushed for 5,320 yards in five NFL seasons, is  
guaranteed $9.6 million. That includes a $7 million signing bonus 
and $2.6 million base salary this season. He'll make $19 million in 
the first four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The sticking point in negotiations was the fifth year, in which  
Faulk will get a $7 million salary and a $5 million roster bonus. 
The deal was structured in that fashion to prevent the Rams from 
designating Faulk as a transition or franchise player. The Rams had 
wanted to load the contract at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll also make $7 million in the sixth and seventh years. In  
addition, Faulk can void the contract after four years and become 
an unrestricted free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he'll opt out,'' Arceneaux said with a chuckle.  
``If he gets to year five of the contract, there's a big reward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the talking is finally over, Faulk said he was looking  
forward to earning his pay. He planned to start practicing 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk was the league's top all-purpose back last season with  
Indianapolis. He rushed for 1,319 yards and caught 86 passes. The 
Rams acquired Faulk from the Colts for second- and fifth-round 
draft picks two days before the NFL draft in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The club knew they'd have to rework the contract he signed out  
of San Diego State as the second player taken in the 1994 draft. 
Faulk had two years to go on a deal that was scheduled to pay him 
$2.2 million in base salary this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk attended an early minicamp but skipped the June minicamp.  
The signing comes three days after the Rams scrimmaged with the 
Colts in Champaign, Ill., and Faulk said he hated to miss that 
gathering. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why would I duck them?'' he said. ``I would love to scrimmage  
against those guys. Nothing against the players, the coaching staff 
or Jim Irsay, but there's some people there who felt I couldn't 
play the game at the level at which I was playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dick Vermeil said last week that he would have held Faulk  
out of the scrimmage in any case. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams play their first preseason game Saturday against the  
Oakland Raiders at the Trans World Dome and Faulk didn't know if 
he'd play. He's been working out with trainer Bobby Kersee, but 
knew that wasn't the same as being on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty familiar with the offense,'' he said. ``I hope I'm  
in shape. But there's nothing like running with pads and practicing 
every day.''

<HEADLINE> Duval To Return to No. 1 in World  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tiger Woods won the match. Now he's going to lose his No. 1  
ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	Exactly one week after Woods' 2 and 1 victory over David Duval  
in their made-for-television exhibiton match, Duval will replace 
him as No. 1 when the next Official World Ranking is published 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both players said their ``Showdown at Sherwood,'' the first live  
telecast of a golf event on prime time, would not decide who was 
No. 1 in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	How right they were.  
</P>
<P>
	Never mind that Woods scored a convincing victory in only the  
second time they have played together in competition. The 
confusing, at times confounding, world ranking has always had more 
to do with crunching numbers than with birdies and bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
	The ranking is based on points determined by where a player  
finishes in an official tournament over two years, with points 
double the value in the current 52 weeks. Then, it is divided by 
the number of tournaments played. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods was fourth in the Buick Open last year and got 12 points,  
a total that will be reduced to six points on Monday. The four 
points he had for finishing eighth in the Buick in 1997 will expire 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	For losing 10 points but also one event, his average will go  
from 14.04 to 14.13. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval, on the other hand, missed the cut in 1997 and did not  
play the Buick Open last year. So he loses no points and one 
tournament, and will go from 13.92 to 14.20. Duval also picked up 
six points for finishing 11th in the Greater Hartford Open last 
week. He closed with a 63, which effectively helped him move back 
to No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``This certainly shows the two players are so closely matched  
that the No. 1 position is hard to call at the moment,'' said Tony 
Greer of IMG, who administers the PGA Tour-sanctioned world ranking 
from London. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods was No. 1 for 41 weeks until Duval replaced him after  
winning The Players Championship, and his lead increased when he 
won the next week in Atlanta. He held the spot for 14 weeks until 
Woods got it back with victories in the Memorial and the Western 
Open, along with a third-place finish in the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods has been No. 1 the past five weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	Unless Woods finishes higher in the PGA Championship, Duval can  
expect to be No. 1 for at least two more weeks. Based on the 
two-year rolling scale, Duval will continue to lose fewer points 
than Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, Duval will start losing the points he earned for  
winning three straight tournaments at the end of the 1997 season, 
and Woods likely will regain No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Got it?  
</P>
<P>
	This isn't the first time the world ranking figures to come  
under heavy criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval had no peer in the first quarter of the year when he won  
four times. Still, Woods remained No. 1 on the strength of his four 
victories in 1997, including the Masters (majors are worth more 
points). 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody is going to have to explain to me what I'll have to  
do to get to No. 1,'' Duval said earlier this year. At the time, he 
had won nine times in 29 tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	The answer appears to be simple.  
</P>
<P>
	Just play the No. 1 player in an exhibition match and get beat.

<HEADLINE> Society To Limit Journal's Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Massachusetts Medical Society has agreed to  
limit the use of the name New England Journal of Medicine when 
promoting its other publications, a controversy that led to the 
dismissal of an editor last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The use of the journal's name was the subject of week-long  
negotiations between the society and Dr. Marcia Angell, the 
journal's No. 2 editor, who the society hopes will take charge 
while it searches for a new editor in chief. 
</P>
<P>
	Angell, 60, said she will not seek the top job at the journal  
and will leave to teach and write after the new editor is named. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement announced Wednesday over use of the journal's  
name, she said, ``strengthens and clarifies the necessary 
separation between the New England Journal and the society's other 
ventures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The journal ousted Dr. Jerome Kassirer as editor in chief  
because of Kassirer's long-standing opposition to using the 
journal's name to promote other journals, magazines and consumer 
newsletters. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the ideas that had been floated was creating a line of  
second-tier specialty journals, with names such as the New England 
Journal of Cardiology, that would print the magazine's rejected 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
	The New England Journal, which is widely regarded as the world's  
most prestigious medical magazine, is also highly profitable. While 
the society declines to release figures, the Boston Globe estimates 
that the journal and other society publications account for about 
95 percent of the society's $73 million annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement states that the society can say its new  
publications are ``from the publishers of the New England Journal 
of Medicine.'' But it cannot use the journal's name or logo in any 
other way on its products or marketing campaigns without the 
editor's permission. 
</P>
<P>
	``What all of us are looking to is a control over the words `New  
England Journal of Medicine,''' said Dr. Jack Evjy, the society's 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Evjy said future journal editors will have the same veto power  
as Angell negotiated over use of the journal's name.

<HEADLINE> Strip Class Offered at Mt. Holyoke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH HADLEY, Mass. (AP) -- Students at one of the nation's  
oldest women's colleges can learn to take it off, all off -- from a 
Russian literature lecturer. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Scotto, who stripped in clubs while getting her doctorate  
at the University of California at Berkeley, said exotic dancing is 
an art form that pleases the dancer and the viewer. Her noncredit 
how-to class in striptease at Mount Holyoke College was so popular 
last year that she plans to offer it again this September. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Scotto shows students clips from movies featuring strippers,  
teaches them some basic bump-and-grind moves and supplies them with 
props, including feather boas, scarves, fans and high heels. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see any way how an exchange of pleasure is something  
to be condemned,'' she told the Union-News in Springfield. 
``Someone in any form of work can feel exploited. It's all a state 
of mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reached at home, the mother of two, whose husband also teaches  
Russian at Mount Holyoke, declined to elaborate but said she stood 
by her statements. 
</P>
<P>
	College President Joanne Creighton pointed out Wednesday that  
although the class was held in a campus dance studio, the course is 
not part of the college curriculum, ``nor does Professor Scotto 
receive any pay for this noncredit class.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Professors often offer outside classes and lectures, and Ms.  
Scotto's attracted little attention, said Sally Sutherland, 
associate dean of faculty. Ms. Sutherland said the class does not 
run counter to the 162-year-old college's feminist traditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where else but a women's college could provide a safe and  
secure place to explore the boundaries of an art form that slides 
over into pornography and exploitation?'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sophomore Patty McCarthy was one of the 65 students who took the  
class last year. She said she would consider taking it again: ``It 
was sort of fun.''

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Nears Senate Confirmation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Diplomatic troubleshooter Richard Holbrooke's  
longest mission, winning Senate confirmation to be U.N. ambassador, 
appeared near an end today. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who earlier had been  
among four senators holding up a final vote, suggested a final 
floor vote could come as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Holbrooke has always appeared to have overwhelming  
support in the Senate, it has been 14 months since President 
Clinton announced his selection for the top diplomatic post. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of delays has plagued the nomination, most recently a  
wave of parliamentary maneuvers by individual senators to delay a 
final vote, mostly over unrelated disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke, now an investment banker, is a former ambassador to  
Germany and was architect of the 1995 accord that ended the war in 
Bosnia. He has also served at Clinton's special envoy to the 
Balkans during the Kosovo crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott predicted Holbrooke's confirmation if Sen. Charles Grassley  
withdraws his opposition ``and there are no other issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley, R-Iowa, is the only remaining senator with a ``hold''  
on the Holbrooke nomination. Grassley has objected to the State 
Department's treatment of a whistle-blower Linda Shenwick. 
</P>
<P>
	A Grassley spokeswoman, Jill Kozeny, said that while talks  
between the senator and State Department on Shenwick's plight are 
continuing, ``Generally, Senator Grassley's concerns have been met. 
</P>
<P>
	``But he's going to take additional steps to make sure fairness  
returns,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley contends that Shenwick, who worked at the U.N. mission  
in New York, was demoted and transferred to a lesser job in 
Washington in retaliation for her telling members of Congress about 
waste and inefficiency at the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department has said Shenwick was reassigned because of  
unsatisfactory job performance, not because she was a 
whistle-blower. 
</P>
<P>
	John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Lott, said a floor vote could  
come at any time on the nomination as Congress prepares to leave 
for its August vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott had detected ``some movement'' in recent days in support of  
ending Holbrooke's long odyssey, Czwartacki said.

<HEADLINE> Flight Delayed Over Security Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The FBI, tipped to a ``potential threat to  
national security,'' has detained a man who paid cash for a one-way 
ticket to Turkey on a Delta Air Lines flight. 
</P>
<P>
	All 217 passengers on Flight 40 to Istanbul, Turkey, were asked  
to get off the plane Tuesday night for a security sweep that 
included luggage. Six passengers were questioned and the man was 
detained. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as the terrorism concern, all of that has been  
resolved,'' FBI agent Tom Bush said. ``We have not been able to 
connect him to any terroristic group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said the agency had received information about the man as  
``a potential threat to national security.'' He said the man was 
not under arrest, but not free to go until authorities addressed 
``other law enforcement issues that still need to be resolved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush would not elaborate on what caused authorities to consider  
the man a threat. The flight left Hartsfield Atlanta International 
Airport about four hours late. 
</P>
<P>
	The Valdosta Daily Times reported today that airport officials  
became suspicious when the man paid cash for his one-way ticket and 
then retrieved his luggage from a large U-Haul truck parked outside 
the terminal.

<HEADLINE> Drug Dealer's Car Linked to Martin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- An expensive luxury car sought in connection with a  
convicted drug dealer was located after Miami Dolphins wide 
receiver Tony Martin turned it back to the dealership, a federal 
agent testified Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency agent Daryn Johnson told jurors  
that authorities were seeking a black 1996 Mercedes 500 SL 
convertible they believed was in Rickey Brownlee's possession. The 
car surfaced when Martin returned it to a dealer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents seized four other cars as part of Brownlee's January 1998  
arrest. A sixth vehicle, a pickup truck, hasn't been found. Also 
seized were 14 homes that DEA officials said were bought by 
Brownlee's drug ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's testimony and cross-examination took all day to  
complete, and Martin's link to the Mercedes was the only time the 
player's name was mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin is being tried along with Brownlee in a case largely  
focusing on Brownlee's alleged drug activities from 1995-97. 
Brownlee, known on the streets as the ``Mayor of Opa-locka,'' spent 
seven years in prison for 1980s drug convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The receiver sat silently through most of the day, although he  
and Brownlee did exchange conversation across the defense table 
during breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, 33, is charged with five counts of money laundering. The  
receiver allegedly leased three cars in his name on behalf of 
Brownlee, who paid him back with cash. The receiver also is accused 
of writing a check to Brownlee's lawyer in exchange for a cash 
reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
	Brownlee, 42, faces five counts of possessing heroin or cocaine  
with the intent to distribute and one count of conspiracy to 
possess and distribute. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial, before U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore, is  
expected to last four weeks. That could keep Martin in court until 
about two weeks before the NFL season opens. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin returned to court Wednesday after missing Tuesday's  
session to practice with the Dolphins. The wideout only has to be 
present on days in which testimony is connected to his case. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, though, Martin's link to testimony lasted all of  
10 seconds. Assistant U.S. attorney Ron DeWaard spent the day 
building the prosecution's case against Brownlee, as Johnson 
chronicled several drug transactions with Brownlee or his 
associates. 
</P>
<P>
	Mel Black, Brownlee's lawyer, poked a couple holes in Johnson's  
testimony. He noted the sequence of events Johnson related in one 
transaction did not match those in the agent's report. He also 
pointed out that Johnson misidentified a man on a surveillance 
videotape as Brownlee.

<HEADLINE> Workplace Deaths Decline in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans who died from injuries  
at work last year was the lowest since the Labor Department started 
keeping track in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Job-related deaths fell to 6,026 in 1998 -- about 17 fatal  
injuries each day -- down from 6,238 in 1997, according to the 
agency's Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	``With employment at an all-time high, it is especially  
heartening to see a 3 percent drop in job-related fatalities,'' 
Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said Wednesday. ``It's good news for 
every family that sends a breadwinner into the workplace and waits 
for him or her to come home safe and whole at the end of the day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer workplace homicides -- the second leading cause of  
on-the-job deaths -- accounted for much of the overall decline. In 
1998, 709 people were murdered at work, compared with 860 in 1997. 
Overall homicide rates also declined nationally last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Most workplace homicides were related to robberies and occurred  
at grocery stores, bars and restaurants and gas stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Highway crashes continued to be the leading cause of on-the-job  
deaths and the number of those fatalities rose slightly in 1998, to 
1,431. About two-fifths of the victims were truck drivers. An 
additional 413 workers were fatally struck by vehicles last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Deaths from falls and electrocutions also increased in 1998,  
with the booming construction industry accounting for much of the 
rise in those categories. Meanwhile, the number of deaths from 
workers being struck by falling objects or getting caught in 
running machinery declined. 
</P>
<P>
	Among men, highway incidents were the leading cause of workplace  
deaths in 1998. Homicide topped the list for women. Workers under 
age 17 were most often killed while doing farm or construction 
work.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Steel, Oil Loan Guarantee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House gave final congressional approval  
Wednesday to federal guarantees for $1.5 billion in loans for 
steel, oil and natural gas companies, aiming to help industries 
that have been rocked by low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The 246-176 vote came seven weeks after the Senate passed the  
bill by 63-34. Supporters said they expect President Clinton to 
sign the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsors of the leglislation said the three industries have  
suffered thousands of job losses as prices have dipped. Steel 
companies have also been battered by low-cost imports. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot allow foreign nations to export their unemployment  
to the United States,'' said Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, one of the 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents said the measure was little better than the  
protectionism the U.S. government criticizes other countries for. 
And they said it would force U.S. taxpayers to back some companies 
and banks that have simply made bad business decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure there are a lot of people who lost their jobs,'' said  
House Minority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, speaking of a recession 
that hit the oil industry in the early 1980s. ``But the oil 
industry got through that deep depression and they're stronger for 
that today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., pushed the steel aid through the  
Senate earlier this year in legislation paying for the war with 
Yugoslavia. It was designed to help only some small steel 
companies, including Weirton Steel Corp. in West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	He took it off that bill in exchange for promises that Congress  
would consider it separately. Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., won a 
similar pledge for assistance for oil and gas companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide steel companies federal guarantees for $1  
billion in loans. Steel companies would be eligible to borrow up to 
$250 million each at market interest rates. U.S. oil and gas 
producers and service companies could borrow up to $10 million each 
from a fund guaranteeing $500 million in loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would cost taxpayers an estimated $270 million to  
back the loans. That would come from trimming federal 
administrative costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a $187 million break for the struggling U.S. steel  
industry fell by the wayside as Congress rushed to assemble its 
tax-cut bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The House-approved tax break -- not a high priority for all  
manufacturers -- was dropped during House-Senate negotiations late 
Tuesday as lawmakers sought to complete work on the tax package 
before their August vacation at week's end. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax break for the steel industry would have allowed  
manufacturers to reduce their alternative minimum tax by using 
credits sooner than otherwise possible. Accelerating the schedule 
for those tax credits would have cost the government an estimated 
$187 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Phil English, a member of the tax-writing House Ways and  
Means Committee, said the provision did not survive because not 
enough steel manufacturers wanted it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The steel industry was unable to offer a united front,''  
English, R-Pa., said. ``In lieu of a consensus, there was 
inadequate support in conference to keep a provision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He would not name the companies that did not back the provision.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite losing a chance at special tax treatment, he said, the  
steel industry would benefit through a general reduction in the 
burden of the Alternative Minimum Tax, which many steel producers 
have had to pay because of low profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Clinton administration officials were to meet  
Thursday at the White House with steel manufacturers and union 
leaders and offer new proposals to help the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals include a pledge to oppose any new World Bank and  
International Monetary Fund loans that would further subsidize 
foreign steel industries and a Commerce Department review of 
foreign steel subsidies.	   But with the surge in steel imorts beginning to decline, the 
administration believes continuing to enforce existing laws is the 
right course, one administration official said, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry has filed trade complaints against a variety of  
countries, and won several cases, but those take a long time and 
have to be handled one kind of steel at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers have complained that as soon as one country  
reduces exports of a certain type of steel, another steps up its 
exports, leaving American docks just as loaded with inexpensive, 
hard-to-compete-against steel. 
</P>
<P>
	At least three publicly traded steel companies have declared  
bankruptcy since the import surge began, and many companies have 
reported operating losses.

<P>
	WRIGHTSVILLE BEACH, N.C. (AP) -- Reality provided a little more  
excitement than his usual TV fiction for ``Dawson's Creek'' actor 
Joshua Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor, who plays Pacey Witter on the series on the WB  
network, and a friend saw two young women who had gotten into 
distress while swimming along the shore near Wrightsville Beach on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, 21, and his unidentified friend dove into the ocean and  
swam out to help the young women, who were floating near the rock 
jetty that separates Masonboro Inlet from the Atlantic Ocean, said 
Coast Guard Petty Officer Jody Howey. 
</P>
<P>
	But when they reached the pair, waves swept them all over the  
jetty and into the inlet, and then the current of the falling tide 
prevented them from getting back to shore, Howey said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Coast Guard boat rescued all four about 7 p.m. and no one was  
injured, Howey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson ``kept them safe and floating until the Coast Guard got  
there. He just helped out somebody who needed it,'' said David 
Hartley, producer of the show filmed in nearby Wilmington 
</P>
<P>
	The young women, who were not identified, were not involved with  
the television show, Hartley said.

<HEADLINE> Cuban High Jumper Had High Profile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Of Cuba's high-profile athletes, one  
stood above them all: Javier Sotomayor. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Sotomayor went from a national hero to one of the  
most disgraced athletes in sports when Pan American Games officials 
said he had tested positive for cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor, the world indoor and outdoor record-holder in the  
high jump, is the only person to clear 8 feet. After winning four 
Pan Am Games titles, an Olympic gold medal in 1992, two world 
outdoor championships and four world indoor titles, Sotomayor now 
perhaps will be best remembered for the shame he brought upon his 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Just like Ben Johnson.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was hero-worshipped by Canadians after sprinting to a  
world record in the 100 meters at the 1988 Olympic Games. A couple 
of days later, he was stripped of his gold medal when Olympic 
officials found high levels of anabolic steroids in his urine 
sample. Johnson left Seoul in disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the International Amateur Athletic Federation, the world  
governing body for the sport, receives documentation on the drug 
test, it will order the Cuban federation to suspend Sotomayor for 
two years. Cuba can appeal, but Sotomayor must be suspended first. 
</P>
<P>
	With his familiar wraparound glasses, the long-legged, 6-foot-4  
Sotomayor is a presence wherever he goes in Cuba, and he thrives on 
the attention. 
</P>
<P>
	He is a wealthy man, with a home provided by the government, a  
red Mercedes Benz and a huge watch collection. 
</P>
<P>
	He is very influential in Cuba sports circles and has a close  
relationship with deputy sports minister Alberto Juantorena, the 
1976 Olympic 400- and 800-meter gold medalist. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor is considered the best high jumper ever -- better than  
Dick Fosbury, better than Valery Brumel, better than John Thomas. 
No one has accomplished more than the 31-year-old Cuban. 
</P>
<P>
	Probably no one had more strength and speed than Sotomayor.  
Probably no one was a better technician. Probably no one was more 
of a perfectionist. 
</P>
<P>
	On the day of a meet, immediately before each jump, Sotomayor  
took several minutes to visualize a flawless performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try to imagine the perfect movements that I would make for a  
perfect jump and then I repeat that image in my mind,'' he has 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He then would sprint toward the bar for his backward, headfirst  
``Fosbury Flop.''. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel comfortable without a good rhythm,'' said  
Sotomayor, who started 15 to 20 feet farther back than most 
jumpers. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Sotomayor's biggest admirers was Dwight Stones, the  
former world record-holder. Stones was impressed with Sotomayor's 
powerful, aggressive, straight-ahead approach to the bar. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time I saw it, I didn't believe it,'' Stones said.  
``I thought his knee was going to be left on the ground somewhere. 
I said this guy is doing exactly what you have to do to jump 
high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor is from Limonar, Cuba, a small town in the central  
part of the island, about 60 miles from Havana. Like most Cuban 
youngsters, he grew up playing baseball and loved playing center 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	He started in track at age 9, and by 13 he was exclusively a  
high jumper, clearing 5-5. Six years later, he had won junior 
titles at the Pan Am Games and the World Junior Championships, and 
raised his career best to 7-8 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor won the first of his record four Pan Am titles in 1987  
at Indianapolis. Five days after missing the 1988 Olympics because 
of Cuba's absence, Sotomayor cleared a world record 7-11 1/2, nearly 
two inches higher than the winning jump at the Seoul Games. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, he broke world records twice, soaring 7-11 1/2 indoors,  
then making his historic 8-foot leap at San Juan. Sotomayor had one 
more world record in him, jumping 8-0 1/2 in 1993, one year after 
winning the Olympic gold. 
</P>
<P>
	All that great jumping, all those wonderful accomplishments, all  
that pride that made Sotomayor one of the world's great athletes 
was washed away Wednesday with one positive drug test.

<HEADLINE> Ford Faces Possible UAW Showdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The United Auto Workers have scheduled a  
strike-authorization vote at Ford Motor Co. plants nationwide in 
less than two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The move stems from the potential spinoff of the No. 2  
automaker's Visteon Automotive Systems parts unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The union has scheduled an Aug. 17 strike-authorization vote.  
Though such votes are routine every three years before the UAW 
contracts with Detroit's automakers expire in September, holding 
one at all of one company's locals on the same day is unusual. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the vote is meant to send a strong message to the  
No. 2 automaker, which has enjoyed relatively smooth relations with 
the UAW for more than 20 years but is feeling heat this year over 
Visteon. 
</P>
<P>
	The union opposes a spinoff, fearing it could bode poorly for  
its 28,500 members at Visteon. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote is ``a very slight wake-up call, just to signal that  
this is an important issue and that the union is absolutely 
prepared to strike, if necessary,'' labor Professor Harley Shaiken 
at the University of California-Berkeley said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A strike authorization vote does not necessarily mean there  
would be a strike. Union leaders are required to seek rank-and-file 
authorization before calling a walkout. Workers usually vote 
overwhelmingly in favor of a strike, typically as a show of support 
for their union negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW spokesman Paul Krell played down the vote, saying such  
balloting is ``always done at all locations in a very narrow window 
anyway.'' Similar votes are planned at General Motors Corp. and 
DaimlerChrysler AG plants, though not on a single day. 
</P>
<P>
	But he did not dismiss the importance of Visteon to the UAW,  
given union sentiments that job security for generations of 
autoworkers current and future ``are very much of paramount 
concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Pestillo, the Ford vice chairman who is the chief  
architect of the company's successful labor relations, declined to 
comment on whether UAW leaders were trying to send Ford a message. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll have to ask them how they feel about what they're doing  
there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW's strike vote comes as the union continues separate  
negotiations that began in June with DaimlerChrysler, GM and Ford. 
Their contracts expire Sept. 14, and talks are expected to 
intensify around Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford has not yet stated its plans for Visteon, but has said it's  
considering a spinoff. There also have been reports that Ford is 
considering merging Visteon with Lear Corp., another large parts 
maker. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressure for a spinoff has increased since GM distributed shares  
in its Delphi Automotive Systems parts unit to GM shareholders in 
May after an initial public offering in January. Delphi is the 
world's largest auto parts manufacturer, followed by Visteon.

<HEADLINE> Factory Orders Rise in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Orders to factories, bolstered by higher  
demand for autos and electronic equipment, rose 0.7 percent in June 
in a fresh sign of recovery for the manufacturing sector. 
</P>
<P>
	This 10th increase in the last 13 months followed a 1 percent  
gain in May, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Many analysts 
expected factory orders to rise by 0.4 percent in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, the factory sector continues to show signs of a  
jagged recovery, but it appears to be on an improving path,'' said 
economist Lynn Reaser with Bank of America Private Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	A rise in orders for autos and car parts more than offset a  
decrease in demand for airplane and aircraft parts and contributed 
to a 2.3 percent increase in orders for all transportation products 
in June. That was down from a hefty 9.9 percent gain the month 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the volatile transportation category, factory orders  
still would have risen a solid 0.5 percent in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``The numbers are surprisingly good,'' said National Association  
of Manufacturers economist Gordon Richards, adding that factory 
orders are running 4.1 percent higher than in June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for electronic and other electrical equipment, the  
category that includes household appliances and communications 
equipment, rose 2.4 percent in June following a drop of 0.9 percent 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall gain in June factory orders came despite a steep,  
5.1 percent decrease in orders for industrial machinery and 
equipment, the sector that includes computers. It was the second 
straight monthly decline. In May, orders for industrial machinery 
fell 4.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said the U.S. manufacturers are gradually recovering  
from a global financial crisis, which dampened overseas demand for 
U.S. goods and increased competition from a flood of cheaper 
imports. Since March 1998, about 488,000 manufacturing jobs have 
been lost. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Purchasing Management reported  
Tuesday that the U.S. manufacturing sector grew in July for the 
sixth straight month, but not as strongly as most analysts 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's report also offered some positive signs for the  
steel industry. Orders for primary metals, the category that 
includes steel, rose 0.4 percent in June, following gains in April 
and May. The steel industry has been one of the hardest hit by the 
Asian crisis, suffering from a flood of cheaper imported steel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, orders for durable goods -- items expected to last at  
least three years -- also went up in June, rising 0.4 percent. It 
was the 10th increase in the last 13 months. And, orders for 
nondurable goods, such as food and fuel also increased, posting a 
1.2 percent gain, following a 0.9 percent gain in May.

<HEADLINE>  Lions Sign QB Hollas, Let Go Powlus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIVERSITY CENTER, Mich. (AP) -- The Detroit Lions released  
quarterback Ron Powlus on Wednesday to make room for newcomer 
Donald Hollas, a former quarterack for the Oakland Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
	Powlus joined the Lions roughly six months ago as a free agent  
but was let go in a move Lions coach Bobby Ross called ``a tough 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to take a good look at Powlus,'' Ross said at the  
Lions' camp at Saginaw Valley State. ``I don't want five QB's out 
here. I wanted four, so we had to make that decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that we have Don Hollas in, he has to do a lot of catching  
up,'' Ross said of the newcomer who spent his first day in 
Detroit's camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions corps of quarterbacks also includes starter Charlie  
Batch, Gus Frerotte and Corey Sauter. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Raiders last season, Hollas completed 135 of 260 passes  
for 1,754 yards. He threw 10 touchdowns and 16 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Powlus, who has never thrown an NFL regular-season pass, tossed  
for 121 yards in two preseason games for the relocated Tennessee 
franchise last year. During the final two weeks of last season, he 
was with the St. Louis Rams' practice squad.

	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Tony Gwynn hit his third career grand slam and  
two singles in his first four at-bats Wednesday night, giving him 
2,998 career hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn had been 1-for-9 the first two games of the series and  
entered the game 13-for-57 (.228) since being activated from the 
disabled list July 19. The stretch had dropped his average to .309, 
30 points below his career average. 
</P>
<P>
	After fouling out in the first, Gwynn singled and scored on  
Reggie Sanders' home run in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn hit his fifth homer of the season off Kent Mercker's first  
pitch with two outs in the fifth to put the Padres ahead 6-3. His 
last grand slam was June 26, 1997, an inside-the-park homer at Los 
Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Dow Chemical Donates Patents to RPI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TROY, N.Y. (AP) -- Now this is recycling.  
</P>
<P>
	Dow Chemical Co. didn't need some patents so the company found  
someone who did. The officials at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute 
were eager to take the $4 million in patents and now are using them 
to shop for international companies interested in licensing film 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The patents are about 4 years old. Company officials said the  
patents were donated after it was determined they no longer fit the 
company's long-range plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Big companies often wind up with lots of patents in areas they  
are not going to develop. It's a great opportunity for us,'' said 
Bruce Nauman, an engineering professor who handles patenting and 
licensing at the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the patents grant the university all U.S. rights to a  
film technology that protects outdoor plastic products like house 
siding. The fourth patent gives RPI the U.S. and foreign rights to 
technology that protects indoor appliances. 
</P>
<P>
	With a number of professors who deal in polymers, including  
plastic recycling, the school is well positioned to take advantage 
of the patents, said Robert Wintermyer, global intellectual asset 
manager for Dow. 
</P>
<P>
	The patent donation isn't the first to be made to a school by a  
company. In February, DuPont Co. donated $64 million worth of 
technology to the University of Iowa, Penn State University and 
Virginia Polytechnic Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	When corporations make such donations, they are generally  
granted tax breaks worth one third of the value of the patents.

<HEADLINE> Probe Captured Asteroid Science Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- An asteroid targeted by a NASA  
spacecraft last week may be a chip off a bigger rock orbiting 
elsewhere in the solar system, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deep Space 1 flew within 16 miles of Braille, a peanut-shaped  
object about 1.3 miles long. The July 26 flyby was the closest ever 
by a spacecraft, at about twice the distance of a jetliner cruising 
above the Earth's surface. 
</P>
<P>
	Its camera failed to take close-up pictures during the  
encounter, but a spectrometer was able to capture data on the 
surface composition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's often said a picture is worth a thousand words, but today  
under this circumstance a spectrum is worth a thousand pictures,'' 
said Robert Nelson, a mission scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
	Braille is remarkably similar to Vesta, a much bigger asteroid  
that orbits millions of miles away between Mars and Jupiter, 
mission scientists said Tuesday. Both contain rock that was once 
molten -- something rarely found in other asteroids. 
</P>
<P>
	The simple explanation is that ``Vesta was a victim of a  
collision of some sort and that it spewed off chips of the old 
rock,'' said Bonnie Buratti, a member of the mission's science 
team. Pictures from the Hubble Space Telescope also show Vesta, 
which is about 325 miles across, has a large impact crater on its 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists will continue to run computer models to find out how  
Braille could have traveled so far. Braille has an irregular orbit 
between Earth and Mars. Vesta is in a belt of asteroids between 
Mars and Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
	Such studies could help scientists figure out ways of  
redirecting asteroids that may threaten Earth, said Eileen Ryan, an 
assistant professor of physics at New Mexico Highlands University 
in Las Vegas, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can prepare for a possible asteroid hazard situation as we  
learn more about how they break up,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such information might be useful in about 4,000 years when  
Braille's orbit could put the 1.2-mile long, peanut-shaped rock on 
a collision course with Earth. Further number crunching is 
necessary to better assess the danger, Buratti said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Kipketer, Jones Lead Herculis Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) -- Wilson Kipketer and Marion Jones  
showed why they are favorites to win the $1 million Golden League 
jackpot with convincing wins at the Herculis track and field meet 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gabriela Szabo and Bernard Barmasai also won their races to stay  
in contention for the end-of-the-season prize. 
</P>
<P>
	Kipketer is storming back to form after a bout of malaria.  
</P>
<P>
	After one lap of the 800-meter race, he trailed the leaders by  
five meters. But with 200 meters to go, the Kenyan-born runner was 
on the shoulder of leader David Kiptoo, then put on a finishing 
spring that gave him a five-yard victory in one minute, 42.57 
seconds -- the best time of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Kipketer, the world record holder in the event, played down the  
possibility of winning the Golden League jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody talks about how much money I can win this season,  
but they forget I have to work for it,'' he said. ``I am like 
everyone else who works for his salary. I can't go after the money 
without doing the job. I was pleased with my race; it is getting 
better all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones didn't win as easily as usual -- she was 0.11 seconds ahead  
of fellow American Inger Miller -- but did enough to extend her 
winning streak to 19 races. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing is to get a win. A lot of athletes  
don't get the recognition they deserve and they really pushed me 
today,'' the 23-year-old said. 
</P>
<P>
	Szabo ran a brilliant 3,000-meter race.  
</P>
<P>
	The tiny blond, paced by compatriot Luminita Gogirlea, took the  
lead with 1,000 meters to go, accompanied by four other runners, 
including Portugal's Olympic 10,000-meter champion Fernanda Ribeiro 
and Russia's Mariya Pantyukhova. 
</P>
<P>
	All five runners were still tightly grouped when Szabo began her  
sprint with 200 yards to go, winning in 8 minutes, 28.36 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden League series jackpot is shared by those athletes who  
win the same event in all seven meets. Szabo -- the 5,000-meter 
world champion -- has now won all four 3,000-meter races. 
</P>
<P>
	Barmasai also won his fourth straight steeplechase.  
</P>
<P>
	Two laps from the end, the 25-year-old world record holder had  
established a 40-meter lead. He finished 80 meters in front in 
7:58.99 and has now won all seven of his 3,000-meter steeplechases 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	In a quick 200-meter race, Maurice Greene clocked his fastest  
time of the year, 19.92, to hold off a challenge from Frankie 
Fredericks, who was one hundredth of a second behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Obadele Thompson was third in 20.11.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is my first time under 20 seconds this year, so I am glad.  
After all the good training I have done, it comes together by 
itself,'' Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
	Romania's Violeta Szekely, who got a late start to the season  
after falling down stairs and fracturing an ankle, won the 1,500 
meters in 4:01.49 -- the fastest time of the year. Szekely caught 
Switzerland's Anita Weyermann right at the tape. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's 400 meters, reigning world champion Cathy Freeman  
of Australia beat off the challenge of last year's world No. 1, 
Nigeria's Falilatu Ogunkoya.

<HEADLINE> Public Isn't Eating Fat Substitute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- It seemed like a sure thing: a no-fat  
ingredient that makes food taste as good as the more fat-laden real 
thing. But Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. has not had a sure thing with 
olestra, which it spent more than $200 million and 25 years 
developing. 
</P>
<P>
	The product, which had a splashy but controversial debut three  
years ago under the market name Olean, may provide P&AMP;G less than 
half the $900 million in sales the company projected for the 
product by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Durk Jager, P&AMP;G's chief executive, told analysts in June that  
production at the $250 million plant that makes olestra had fallen 
30 to 40 percent below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G won't comment on reasons for the disappointment, but some  
analysts link it to changes in public attitudes. Others point to 
the possible gastrointestinal side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that Procter &AMP; Gamble ... missed the shift from  
diet-based to health-based decisions, with taste still being the 
priority. I think consumers who thought they were going to be 
excited about it weren't. It wasn't great. It was just OK,'' said 
Mona Doyle, president of Consumer Network, a Philadelphia-based 
market research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``When olestra was introduced, we were at the culmination of  
'fat is the big evil.' Today, we're not into 'fat is the big evil' 
any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Studies say more Americans are fat, and at least some don't seem  
to mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the '90s, we are in self-acceptance,'' said Carol Moog, a  
clinical psychologist and president of Creative Focus in suburban 
Philadelphia, who consults with companies on their marketing. 
``Some people are going back to high-fat products, like premium ice 
creams. They're saying, 'We've had it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The reluctance to embrace olestra also may be related to its  
potential side effects, spelled out on warning labels required on 
snacks made with the fake fat: may cause ``abdominal cramping and 
loose stools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Food and Drug Administration approved olestra for use  
in salted snack foods in 1996, it has been added to only two 
products: Frito-Lay's Wow! chips and P&AMP;G's Fat-Free Pringles. A few 
years ago, P&AMP;G executives hoped olestra was close to being used in 
cake frosting, salad dressing and other items. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G spokeswoman Sydney McHugh said the company plans to focus on  
expanding the kinds of salted snack foods made with olestra. She 
would not say when the company will seek FDA permission to market 
Olean for use in other food categories, but did say it will 
continue to evaluate Olean's long-term possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G has touted olestra as being able to give foods the taste,  
texture and ``mouth feel'' of fat, while not being absorbed into 
the body. But that has not led to widespread consumer demand 
because ``it's an ingredient in search of a product,'' said Alan 
Brew, a partner at Addison Branding &AMP; Communications, a San 
Francisco-based corporate image consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	A consumer advocacy organization that fought olestra's market  
approval and lobbied for a stronger product warning says olestra 
hasn't attracted a consumer following because it is viewed as 
unhealthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like looking at sales figures for Edsels and deciding  
that there's no market for automobiles,'' said Michael Jacobson, 
executive director of the Center for Science in the Public 
Interest. ``I think olestra is a turkey of a product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An olestra alternative that has all the benefits without the  
side effects is being developed, but isn't likely to hit the 
shelves for years, said Kwaku Addo, a University of Kentucky 
associate professor of nutrition and food science. 
</P>
<P>
	Addo has been combining dehydrated fruit powders, which are used  
in some bakery products as fat-replacement ingredients, with a 
small amount of a substance similar in chemical structure to 
olestra. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this stage, I don't want to be overly optimistic,'' Addo  
said. ``You never know until you're done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Addo said he hopes to have preliminary data in time to present  
it in November at a Seattle meeting of the American Association of 
Cereal Chemists. Ms. McHugh of P&AMP;G and Jacobson said they were 
unaware of Addo's research. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, many shoppers brush off the warning and buy snacks  
with olestra. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicki Park has been buying four bags of Wow! chips for her  
family each week since they hit the market and said her family 
hasn't experienced any of olestra's possible side effects. Seven 
years ago, Park weighed 315 pounds before she cut fats from her 
diet to lose 180 pounds. Now, she said she can enjoy some of those 
foods without fear of regaining the weight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to cut out snack foods completely. They were the  
products I enjoyed eating and I really missed that,'' said Park, of 
Pleasant Grove, Ala.

<HEADLINE> Elway Plans Health, Money Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Retired Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway will  
team up with a Florida firm in a venture to create an Internet site 
focused on health, fitness and financial planning, his business 
manager said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway and Boca Raton, Fla.-based JWGenesis Financial Corp. will  
be partners in MVP.com, a company to be launched at the Super Bowl 
in January in Atlanta. Elway and JWGenesis executives were to make 
a formal announcement about the venture in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Sperbeck, Elway's business manager, did not release details  
of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	He described the planned company as ``not specifically sports  
related. It's more of a business venture than a sports venture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Wednesday's editions, the Denver Rocky Mountain News and The  
Denver Post cited unidentified sources as saying the company and 
Web site would feature products and services in fitness, health and 
financial planning as part of the concept of personal goal-setting. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, who retired after leading the Broncos to a second  
straight Super Bowl victory this year, has been involved in 
planning the new Web site for months, the News reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway and JWGenesis President Marshall T. Leeds will be  
co-chairmen of the privately held company, with JWGenesis chief 
operating officer Joel E. Marks serving as day-to-day manager at 
its Atlanta headquarters, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway's other business ventures have included a string of  
Denver-area car dealerships that he sold in 1997 to Wayne 
Huizenga's Republic Industries Inc., since renamed AutoNation Inc. 
He also invested in a Spanish-language Internet company, 
QuePasa!com Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	JWGenesis is a diversified financial-services holding company  
with securities brokerages, investment banking, institutional sales 
and asset management. It trades on the American Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE>  Pan Am High Jumper Stripped of Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Cuban high jump great Javier Sotomayor  
was stripped of his gold medal at the Pan American Games on 
Wednesday after testing positive for cocaine, the biggest drug 
scandal to hit track and field since Ben Johnson at the 1988 Seoul 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor, considered Cuba's most popular athlete, will be  
suspended for two years -- knocking him out of this month's world 
championships and the Sydney Olympics, said Primo Nebiolo, 
president of track and field's international federation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cuban officials said Sotomayor never took cocaine and  
charged the substance had been planted in something he ate or 
drank. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is such a such a gentleman. To us, it is almost impossible  
he would take this substance,'' said Rodrigo Alvarez Cambra, a 
leader of the Cuban delegation. ``He has told us he has not taken 
this substance and we believe his word. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is why we know this is a manipulation in the case of  
Javier Sotomayor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is up to the Cuban federation to suspend Sotomayor, the world  
record holder and the only man to clear 8 feet. But Nebiolo said if 
the Cubans do not suspend Sotomayor for two years, the IAAF will. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am shocked. I cannot believe it. I am very surprised and  
upset because I have great esteem for Sotomayor,'' Nebiolo said 
from a meet in Monaco. 
</P>
<P>
	IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said he expected the Cuban  
federation to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor won his fourth Pan Ams gold in the high jump July 30,  
the final day of the track and field competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans did not name anyone who might have been responsible  
for causing Sotomayor's positive test. And they said they were not 
taking any special precautions to protect their athletes from 
sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are simply eating what the rest of the athletes are  
eating,'' said Dr. Mario Granda, chief doctor of the Cuban medical 
group. ``The only thing we are doing is that we hope those who 
manipulated these results or enhanced these results or altered the 
results of a person who never took this substance will never do 
this again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although all sports have prescribed drug penalties, they are not  
always applied on recreational drugs that are not taken to enhance 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Vasquez Rana, president of the Pan American Sports  
Organization, said his group does not differentiate a recreational 
drug such as cocaine from a performance-enhancing substance such as 
a steroid. 
</P>
<P>
	``To us, it is sanctioned as an infraction,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor was seen in Cuba on Tuesday night at a rally for the  
gold medal-winning baseball team and stood beside President Fidel 
Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	At Sotomayor's one-story blue stucco home in Havana's upscale  
Miramar neighborhood, his wife answered the door and refused to 
comment to reporters. She called government officials, asking them 
to make the reporters leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the government would issue a formal statement  
about Sotomayor later Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug abuse is almost unheard of in Cuba, and earlier this year  
the country revised the penal code to extend the death penalty for 
government officials who engage in drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor is the third athlete, all gold medalists, and the  
second high jumper to test positive at these games. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Vezina, goalie for Canada's in-line roller hockey team,  
was caught using Nandrolone, costing the team its gold medal. Juana 
Rosario Arrendel, winner of the women's high jump and the only gold 
medalist from the Dominican Republic at the games so far, was 
stripped of her medal for using Stanozolol. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Ray Martinez, a member of Mexico's baseball team,  
refused to take a drug test, which was tantamount to a positive 
test. 
</P>
<P>
	Eduardo de Rose, medical chief for the Pan Am Games committee,  
said it makes no difference where the cocaine originated or why it 
was taken, even if it was in a medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the substance is found in urine, we do not question where  
it came from and the reason for taking it,'' de Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor's sample showed cocaine in the amount of 200 parts per  
million, which would be consistent with a person who uses the drug, 
de Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the discovery of cocaine traces indicates the drug would  
have been taken four to five days before the test. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than that, we would not find it,'' he said. ``When we  
find traces of cocaine, ... it shows the ingestion was very 
recent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Granda called Sotomayor a ``complete sports gentleman'' and said  
he was a ``flagbearer for the struggle against doping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``His dignity is much above and beyond any results given in any  
laboratory,'' Granda said. ``He is an innocent man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Granda said Sotomayor's fourth gold medal ``will be in the  
hearts of all Pan Americans who love you and trust you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Sotomayor became the first person to win four Pan Ams  
track and field titles in the same event when he cleared 7-6 1/2. The 
gold medals now go to Canada's Kwaku Boateng and Mark Boswell, who 
tied for the silver. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor won the 1992 Olympic gold medal, the 1993 and 1997  
world outdoor championships, and the 1989, 1993, 1995 and 1999 
world indoor championships. 
</P>
<P>
	He was ranked No. 1 in the world in 1988-89, 1992-95 and  
1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a further embarrassment to Cuba's team at the Pan Am  
games. Eight Cubans have left the delegation, including one 
journalist, with sources close to the team saying at least seven 
plan to defect. 
</P>
<P>
	The finding against Sotomayor marked the biggest scandal in  
track and field since Johnson was stripped of his 100-meter gold 
medal and world record in Seoul for using the performance-enhancing 
drug stanozolol. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson later returned to competition, but he again tested  
positive for drugs in 1993 and was suspended for life. He is 
appealing that ban and has asked for reinstatement by the 
International Amateur Athletic Federation. The IAAF Council will 
meet in Spain on Aug. 17 to decide the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor's case was the third involving big-name track athletes  
in the past two days. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Dennis Mitchell, the U.S. 100-meter champion and  
1992 Olympic bronze medalist, was banned for two years by the IAAF 
after a drug test showed high levels of testosterone. Earlier 
Wednesday, Britain's Linford Christie, 1992 Olympic 100-meter gold 
medalist, was suspended by the IAAF after a drug test showed the 
possible presence of Nandrolone. Christie insisted he was innocent 
and intends to defend himself against the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor assured his place in sports history by soaring 8 feet  
at the Central American Championships at San Juan, Puerto Rico, on 
July 29, 1989. He improved that record to 8-0 1/2 at Salamanca, Spain, 
on July 27, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	He set the world indoor record of 7-11 1/2 on March 4, 1989. He has  
cleared 7-8 1/2 a record 88 times and 7-10 1/2 a record 21 times.

	BOSTON (AP) -- The Massachusetts Medical Society agreed Wednesday  
to sharply limit use of the name of its flagship New England 
Journal of Medicine when promoting its other publications, a 
controversy that led to the dismissal of the journal's editor last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The use of the journal's name was the subject of week-long  
negotiations between the society and Dr. Marcia Angell, the 
journal's No. 2 editor, who the society hopes will take charge 
while it searches for a new editor in chief. 
</P>
<P>
	Angell, 60, said she will not seek the top job at the journal  
and will leave to teach and write after the new editor is named. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement over use of the journal's name, she said,  
``strengthens and clarifies the necessary separation between the 
New England Journal and the society's other ventures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The journal ousted Dr. Jerome Kassirer as editor in chief  
because of Kassirer's long-standing opposition to using the New 
England Journal's name to promote other journals, magazines and 
consumer newsletters. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the ideas that had been floated was creating a line of  
second-tier specialty journals, with names such as the New England 
Journal of Cardiology, that would print the magazine's rejected 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
	The New England Journal, which is widely regarded as the world's  
most prestigious medical magazine, is also highly profitable. While 
the society declines to release figures, the Boston Globe estimates 
that the journal and other society publications account for about 
95 percent of the society's $73 million annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's agreement states that the society can say its new  
publications are ``from the publishers of the New England Journal 
of Medicine.'' But it cannot use the journal's name or logo in any 
other way on its products or marketing campaigns without the 
editor's permission. 
</P>
<P>
	``What all of us are looking to is a control over the words `New  
England Journal of Medicine,''' said Dr. Jack T. Evjy, the 
society's president. 
</P>
<P>
	Evjy said future journal editors will have the same veto power  
as Angell negotiated over use of the journal's name.

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Brad Paisley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Brad Paisley, dark and handsome, was on  
stage singing about lost love to the adoring women of the Wildhorse 
Saloon. 
</P>
<P>
	A guy standing on the dance floor with his enraptured girl  
friend was a little drunk and a lot jealous as he pointed to the 
electrifying singer who had snared the young woman's attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's so miserable, why doesn't he go kill himself?'' said  
the drunk, spilling beer as he motioned to Paisley. 
</P>
<P>
	But Paisley, basking in the approval of his female fans, didn't  
seem to notice the guy. Nor did the drunk's companion or the rest 
of the audience at the spacious, faux honky-tonk in downtown 
Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	The women especially were loving Paisley, who alternated  
lovelorn ballads with witty, fast-paced tunes about -- well, being 
lovelorn. And when he stormed the edges of the stage during 
fleet-fingered guitar solos, the men cheered, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you think I'll just forget you and decide that I don't love  
you/Do you realize what you're tellin' me to do?'' he sang. ``It's 
like saying don't breathe or don't blink/ ... See I just can't turn 
this off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The drunk shuffled off to the bar to console himself with  
another beer, as his companion shoved through the dance floor to 
get closer to the stage and to Paisley, who has emerged this summer 
as THE breakout country music star of 1999. Only neo-Outlaw duo 
Montgomery-Gentry, ``Ordinary Life'' singer Chad Brock and the band 
Lonestar rival him. 
</P>
<P>
	Paisley is a clever songwriter, effective singer and  
accomplished guitarist in the league of Ricky Skaggs or Steve 
Wariner. He's wholesome without being preachy -- the first song on 
his debut album, ``Who Needs Pictures,'' is about cooling your 
heels in church during a long sermon while itching to go fishing. 
</P>
<P>
	The single, also called ``Who Needs Pictures,'' is selling about  
2,500 copies a week, putting it at No. 9 on the country charts, 
just ahead of Montgomery-Gentry's ``Hillbilly Shoes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Remember, you heard it here first,'' said Naomi Judd when  
Paisley was a recent guest on ``Heart to Heart With Naomi Judd,'' 
her syndicated radio show. ``What we have here is a star. And all 
you girls, he's 26 and real easy on the eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moments earlier, Paisley had moved Judd to tears performing his  
song, ``He Didn't Have to Be,'' about a grateful stepson thanking 
the man who married his mother. The song was inspired by the 
relationship his co-writer Kelly Loveless has with his stepson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do a great song and people notice it,'' Paisley said,  
explaining how the Wildhorse crowd knew the words to ``He Didn't 
Have to Be'' well enough to sing along, even though it hasn't been 
issued as a single yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Paisley, who is from Glen Dale, W.Va., learned the basics of  
country music at the knee of his grandfather, Warren Jarvis, an 
amateur guitar picker. As a child, Jarvis looked after Paisley each 
morning before school when Paisley's parents -- his mother is a 
teacher and father works for the West Virginia Department of 
Highways -- went to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarvis bought Paisley his first guitar, a Sears Dancelctro  
Silvertone, when he was 8. Paisley learned to play standards like 
``Wildwood Flower'' from Jarvis, and first sang in church at 10. 
Jarvis died of cancer a few years ago, but not before seeing his 
protege open for The Judds. The ``Who Needs Pictures'' CD is 
dedicated to him. 
</P>
<P>
	In West Virginia, the most prominent country music radio show is  
Jamboree USA on WWVA in Wheeling. The 66-year-old program is the 
second-oldest radio show to the Grand Ole Opry on Nashville's WSM. 
Paisley played it at 12, and was a regular for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doing the Jamboree ... is THE thing that made me who I am,''  
said Paisley, who recently opened for Loretta Lynn in New York City 
and will do the same for Merle Haggard in Nashville. ``That whole 
experience of every Saturday night, getting to open for people as 
legendary as George Jones and Roy Clark. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``You learn real quick what's dying on stage when you say it,''  
he said. ``It gave me a sense of entertainment value for a show as 
opposed to just wanting to sing and trying to imitate people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After two years at West Liberty State College, Paisley had done  
everything he could as a performer in his hometown. A college 
adviser urged him to transfer to Belmont University, which is 
within walking distance of Nashville's Music Row, the center of the 
country music industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had classes called Record Company Operations, and  
Recording Industry 101 and things like that -- Publishing, copyright 
law, stuff I had always wondered about,'' said Paisley, who majored 
in business. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got college credit to learn all that, and they were going to  
let me go and walk into Atlantic Records every day and work there 
for free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paisley was an intern at Atlantic Records, as well as a music  
management firm and ASCAP, where contacts helped him get a contract 
to write songs for a music publishing company and then a record 
deal with Arista. 
</P>
<P>
	Paisley's experience has made him a confident performer.  
</P>
<P>
	``Are there any single people out there?'' Paisley said to  
whoops from the audience at the Wildhorse. ``Well, I'm single, too 
-- and I HATE it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That set up ``Me Neither,'' Paisley's sly take on approaching  
women in bars, then trying to save face when they turn him town. 
Then he ripped through a guitar solo worthy of his greatest 
inspiration on the instrument -- Skaggs. 
</P>
<P>
	Paisley quieted the crowd by making his last encore a gospel  
song, ``In the Garden.'' It is also the last song on his CD. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time he finished, the drunk was a lot happier, swaying  
arm-in-arm with his girlfriend. ``At first I hated him,'' the man 
said his companion about Paisley. ``But he's all right.''

<HEADLINE> Meningitis Hospitalizes Jerry Lewis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Jerry Lewis is ``doing fine'' following a bout  
with viral meningitis and will be ready to host his annual Labor 
Day Telethon next month, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had a miserable week and will likely be spending some  
time on his boat for some r-and-r,'' executive assistant Claudia 
Stabile said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, 73, was hospitalized in Darwin, Australia, earlier this  
week after falling ill Sunday during a performance tour. 
</P>
<P>
	He had hoped to resume performances today in Sydney, but the  
decision was made to cancel the balance of the tour and return 
home. Lewis was described as feeling fine, but not well enough to 
perform. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis lives in Las Vegas with his wife and daughter. He is  
expected to fly home in the next few days, Stabile said. 
</P>
<P>
	The illness will not impact Lewis' role in the annual Los  
Angeles-based Labor Day Telethon for the Muscular Dystrophy 
Association, Stabile said.

<HEADLINE> Fraud Alleged for `Death' Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Two South Florida companies may have  
defrauded investors who bought life-insurance policies from 
terminally ill people, say investigators, who believe that in some 
cases the policies didn't actually exist. 
</P>
<P>
	The odd but legal practice known as ``viatical settlements''  
gives the terminally ill a chance to get much-needed cash while 
they are still alive. Investors buy the life insurance policies at 
a fraction of their value, giving the policyholder money up front, 
and then profit when the seller dies. Viatical companies arrange 
for the sales of the policies and take a share of the proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	The state, and reportedly the FBI, is investigating American  
Benefit Services Inc. and Financial Federated Title and Trust Inc. 
to determine if they cheated investors out of tens of millions of 
dollars by selling fake policies. 
</P>
<P>
	A Florida judge on Wednesday ordered American Benefit Services  
in Lake Worth, Fla., to turn over records to investigators with the 
state Department of Insurance. Investigators also are reviewing 
documents from Sunrise-based Financial Federated Title. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents have already seized assets -- including 40 cars --  
belonging to Financial Federated owner Frederick C. Brandau, 
according to a recent report in The Wall Street Journal. About 
5,000 people have invested between $115 million and $125 million, 
the newspaper reported, citing unnamed sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandau told the Journal that he and his companies have done  
nothing wrong and that he is fighting the accusations. He also said 
that none of the investments were at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Brandau nor American Benefit owner Raphael Ray Levy  
could be reached for comment, and FBI officials declined to comment 
about their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	American Benefit lawyer Houston Park told Circuit Judge Ralph  
Smith Jr. in Tallahassee Wednesday that American Benefit would 
cooperate but believed the insurance department did not have the 
authority to subpoena all the documents it wants from the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Park said the company would not comment on the allegations.  
</P>
<P>
	Brandau's lawyer, Thomas Sclafani, said he will propose a  
settlement to federal prosecutors meant to assure the investors 
that their investments are safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Sclafani said Wednesday that an offshore multinational mining  
company called CSI Ag Ltd., which has bought Financial Federated's 
assets, will cover the investments. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a scam,'' said Sclafani, a former federal  
prosecutor. ``CSI will be more than able to fully guarantee all of 
the investors on the schedule they are supposed to be repaid on. 
... They have as assets a number of gold mines that are very 
lucrative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Benefit and Federated Financial are related, though  
separate, companies. Essentially, Federated Financial lined up the 
terminally ill patients and bought the policies, supplying them to 
American Benefit, which sold the products to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	An internal state insurance department memo in February says  
that American Benefit maintains it solicits investors to buy into 
viatical settlements offered by Financial Federated. American 
Benefit said there wasn't any formal agreement between the two 
companies, according to the memo. 
</P>
<P>
	``This statement is not plausible as all funds solicited by ABS  
are forwarded to FF&AMP;T,'' the department memo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurance department was looking into American Benefit  
before the agency received dozens of complaints from investors this 
spring. A financial specialist recommended the state investigate 
the company after it refused to document that the policies it was 
selling existed. 
</P>
<P>
	Several investors have sued American Benefit in state court in  
Palm Beach County, claiming they asked to see the policies but were 
not provided them. 
</P>
<P>
	A short time after the FBI apparently began looking into  
Brandau's business last fall, he put an ad in the newspaper looking 
to buy viatical policies. 
</P>
<P>
	W. Scott Page, the owner of Wm. Page and Associates, the first  
licensed viatical company in Florida, and the president of the 
National Viatical Association, answered the ad. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandau gave him $1 million to keep in escrow to hold onto to  
show he was interested in buying some of the policies Page already 
had, Page said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They gave it to me with a blanket 'Use it for anything I could  
get.' All they wanted was a policy,'' Page said. ``That's why my 
suspicions started to rise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he thought Brandau wanted policies because he wanted  
something to show investigators, Page said his lawyer advised him 
not to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone can assume what they like,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Pan Am High Jumper Stripped of Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Cuban high jump great Javier Sotomayor  
was stripped of his gold medal at the Pan American Games on 
Wednesday after testing positive for cocaine, the biggest drug 
scandal to hit track and field since Ben Johnson at the 1988 Seoul 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor, considered Cuba's most popular athlete, will be  
suspended for two years -- knocking him out of this month's world 
championships and the Sydney Olympics, said Primo Nebiolo, 
president of track and field's international federation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cuban officials said Sotomayor never took cocaine and  
charged the substance had been planted in something he ate or 
drank. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is such a such a gentleman. To us, it is almost impossible  
he would take this substance,'' said Rodrigo Alvarez Cambra, a 
leader of the Cuban delegation. ``He has told us he has not taken 
this substance and we believe his word. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is why we know this is a manipulation in the case of  
Javier Sotomayor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is up to the Cuban federation to suspend Sotomayor, the world  
record holder and the only man to clear 8 feet. But Nebiolo said if 
the Cubans do not suspend Sotomayor for two years, the IAAF will. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am shocked. I cannot believe it. I am very surprised and  
upset because I have great esteem for Sotomayor,'' Nebiolo said 
from a meet in Monaco. 
</P>
<P>
	IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said he expected the Cuban  
federation to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor won his fourth Pan Ams gold in the high jump July 30,  
the final day of the track and field competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans did not name anyone who might have been responsible  
for causing Sotomayor's positive test. And they said they were not 
taking any special precautions to protect their athletes from 
sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are simply eating what the rest of the athletes are  
eating,'' said Dr. Mario Granda, chief doctor of the Cuban medical 
group. ``The only thing we are doing is that we hope those who 
manipulated these results or enhanced these results or altered the 
results of a person who never took this substance will never do 
this again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although all sports have prescribed drug penalties, they are not  
always applied on recreational drugs that are not taken to enhance 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Vasquez Rana, president of the Pan American Sports  
Organization, said his group does not differentiate a recreational 
drug such as cocaine from a performance-enhancing substance such as 
a steroid. 
</P>
<P>
	``To us, it is sanctioned as an infraction,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor was seen in Cuba on Tuesday night at a rally for the  
gold medal-winning baseball team and stood beside President Fidel 
Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	At Sotomayor's one-story blue stucco home in Havana's upscale  
Miramar neighborhood, his wife answered the door and refused to 
comment to reporters. She called government officials, asking them 
to make the reporters leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the government would issue a formal statement  
about Sotomayor later Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug abuse is almost unheard of in Cuba, and earlier this year  
the country revised the penal code to extend the death penalty for 
government officials who engage in drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor is the third athlete, all gold medalists, and the  
second high jumper to test positive at these games. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Vezina, goalie for Canada's in-line roller hockey team,  
was caught using Nandrolone, costing the team its gold medal. Juana 
Rosario Arrendel, winner of the women's high jump and the only gold 
medalist from the Dominican Republic at the games so far, was 
stripped of her medal for using Stanozolol. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Ray Martinez, a member of Mexico's baseball team,  
refused to take a drug test, which was tantamount to a positive 
test. 
</P>
<P>
	Eduardo de Rose, medical chief for the Pan Am Games committee,  
said it makes no difference where the cocaine originated or why it 
was taken, even if it was in a medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the substance is found in urine, we do not question where  
it came from and the reason for taking it,'' de Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor's sample showed cocaine in the amount of 200 parts per  
million, which would be consistent with a person who uses the drug, 
de Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the discovery of cocaine traces indicates the drug would  
have been taken four to five days before the test. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than that, we would not find it,'' he said. ``When we  
find traces of cocaine, ... it shows the ingestion was very 
recent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Granda called Sotomayor a ``complete sports gentleman'' and said  
he was a ``flagbearer for the struggle against doping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``His dignity is much above and beyond any results given in any  
laboratory,'' Granda said. ``He is an innocent man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Granda said Sotomayor's fourth gold medal ``will be in the  
hearts of all Pan Americans who love you and trust you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Sotomayor became the first person to win four Pan Ams  
track and field titles in the same event when he cleared 7-6 1/2. The 
gold medals now go to Canada's Kwaku Boateng and Mark Boswell, who 
tied for the silver. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor won the 1992 Olympic gold medal, the 1993 and 1997  
world outdoor championships, and the 1989, 1993, 1995 and 1999 
world indoor championships. 
</P>
<P>
	He was ranked No. 1 in the world in 1988-89, 1992-95 and  
1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a further embarrassment to Cuba's team at the Pan Am  
games. Eight Cubans have left the delegation, including one 
journalist, with sources close to the team saying at least seven 
plan to defect. 
</P>
<P>
	The finding against Sotomayor marked the biggest scandal in  
track and field since Johnson was stripped of his 100-meter gold 
medal and world record in Seoul for using the performance-enhancing 
drug stanozolol. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson later returned to competition, but he again tested  
positive for drugs in 1993 and was suspended for life. He is 
appealing that ban and has asked for reinstatement by the 
International Amateur Athletic Federation. The IAAF Council will 
meet in Spain on Aug. 17 to decide the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor's case was the third involving big-name track athletes  
in the past two days. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Dennis Mitchell, the U.S. 100-meter champion and  
1992 Olympic bronze medalist, was banned for two years by the IAAF 
after a drug test showed high levels of testosterone. Earlier 
Wednesday, Britain's Linford Christie, 1992 Olympic 100-meter gold 
medalist, was suspended by the IAAF after a drug test showed the 
possible presence of Nandrolone. Christie insisted he was innocent 
and intends to defend himself against the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor assured his place in sports history by soaring 8 feet  
at the Central American Championships at San Juan, Puerto Rico, on 
July 29, 1989. He improved that record to 8-0 1/2 at Salamanca, Spain, 
on July 27, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	He set the world indoor record of 7-11 1/2 on March 4, 1989. He has  
cleared 7-8 1/2 a record 88 times and 7-10 1/2 a record 21 times.

	Ambassador David Scheffer said Wednesday that the United States  
has no intention of trying to weaken the proposed court, even 
though some critics have alleged that Washington wants changes that 
would undermine the tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States was one of seven countries voting ``no'' when  
120 countries approved the treaty to establish the International 
Criminal Court just over a year ago in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	American officials felt the treaty yielded too much power to the  
new court, leaving U.S. troops and citizens vulnerable to 
politically motivated prosecutions. And Washington's opposition 
hasn't diminished. 
</P>
<P>
	The court will begin operating when the treaty is ratified by 60  
countries, which diplomats estimate will take 2 1/2 to five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Scheffer said the United States' main objective is to close a  
gap in the treaty that unduly constrains countries from using 
military force legitimately. 
</P>
<P>
	As a commission preparing for the court's operation holds its  
second round of meetings, Scheffer has been meeting privately with 
delegates from every continent to discuss the U.S. conditions for 
supporting the court. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials said they approached the talks with hope, and  
believe that if American concerns can be accommodated the court can 
be strengthened. 
</P>
<P>
	But they don't expect to decide on a final proposal to present  
to delegates during the three-week meeting, which ends Aug. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no intention of proposing anything that has the end  
result of weakening the treaty or the operation of the court,'' 
Scheffer said. 
</P>
<P>
	While he refused to discuss exactly what the U.S. is seeking,  
delegates said Washington is looking for an exception from 
investigation or prosecution by the court for personnel involved in 
official international military actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Delegates said the United States also wants to diminish the  
court's authority to determine when governments have failed to 
prosecute -- and to give ultimate decision-making authority to a 
body other than the court. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jelena Pejic of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights said  
any attempt to bar prosecution for official acts ``is blatantly 
contrary to international law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The very purpose of this court is to prosecute and investigate  
the most serious crimes of international concern,'' she said. ``If 
any state can then come up and say, 'well the genocide we committed 
was in an official capacity,' what are we doing here?''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Courses on Garcia's Itinerary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND BLANC, Mich. (AP) -- He is only 19, but Sergio Garcia has  
known for some time that to be a great golfer he must play in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, for only the fourth time, Garcia plays in a pro  
tournament in the United States. His appearance in the Buick Open 
will be a tuneup for next week's PGA Championship and possibly the 
final hurdle for his PGA Tour card. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always said that I'd like to be a global player,'' Garcia  
said Wednesday before practice at Warwick Hills Golf and Country 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``When I was young I said if I wanted to be recognized  
as a good player I have to go to the States. ... Everything is big 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, who has just gotten his driver's license and is looking  
forward to graduating high school, is still plenty young. And he's 
also plenty talented, as he's shown in Europe and America. 
</P>
<P>
	He's already getting tips from Tiger Woods, less on golf than in  
handling sudden fame. Garcia has a shot at making the European 
Ryder Cup team, and a top 10 finish this week in the Buick would 
all but guarantee the Spaniard a PGA Tour card for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia appears to thrive on the parkland courses common to the  
PGA Tour and has had trouble on the windswept links courses of 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	He tied for 38th at this year's Masters, tied for third at the  
GTE Byron Nelson Classic and tied for 11th at the Memorial 
Tournament. He's won more than $200,000 on the U.S. tour, placing 
him 128th on the U.S. money list. He needs to finish the year 125th 
or better to secure his card for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be recognized as Sergio Garcia, not a European Tiger  
Woods,'' Garcia said, speaking slightly accented but fluent English 
he has studied since he was 9. 
</P>
<P>
	He plays an exciting brand of golf, a long-driving,  
go-for-the-pin approach, and he can rack up birdies in a hurry. He 
says he's starting to be recognized in public and so far enjoys 
signing autographs. 
</P>
<P>
	He'd surely get a different view from the besieged Woods, who is  
skipping this week's event to prepare for the PGA at Medinah 
Country Club outside Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia is not yet ready to choose between Europe and the United  
States. He's also exploring tournament opportunities in Asia. But 
his words suggest a tilt toward America. He likes the courses, the 
competition, the money and the exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	At last month's British Open, where he shot 89-83 to miss the  
cut, Garcia said he preferred U.S. courses. On those course, a 
straight drive is rewarded; on links courses, bumps, swales and 
blind shots kick a straight drive into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buick Open, with a $2.4 million purse and $432,000 first  
prize, is important because of its proximity to the PGA 
Championship and next month's Ryder Cup in Brookline, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Crenshaw, the U.S. captain, will make his final two picks  
following the PGA, with the other team positions based on 
tournament performance. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the field features such big names as two-time  
Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal, Ernie Els, Justin Leonard and 
defending champion Billy Mayfair. U.S. Ryder Cup aspirants in the 
field include Jim Furyk, Jeff Maggert, Chris Perry, Steve Stricker 
and John Huston.

<HEADLINE> HUD Won't Sue Gun Manufacturers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal housing officials have no plans to  
file their own lawsuit against gun manufacturers over the damage 
firearms cause, an official said today at a congressional meeting 
called after a report that such a suit was being considered. 
</P>
<P>
	Gail W. Laster, general counsel for the Department of Housing  
and Urban Development, didn't rule out the possibility that the 
agency would file a friend-of-the-court brief or join one of a 
string of lawsuits being filed by local governments trying to 
recoup taxpayer money spent dealing with gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Laster's remarks before the House Government Reform Committee's  
panel on criminal justice drew angry responses from House 
Republicans who said it was preposterous to blame the gun industry 
for the acts of criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite frankly, I am baffled by the idea that the makers of  
guns are seen by anyone as being somehow legally responsible for 
those who acquire the weapons and misuse them,'' said Rep. John 
Mica, R-Fla., subcommittee chairman, who called the subcommittee 
meeting shortly after a Wall Street Journal article last week 
reported on HUD's exploration of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said they didn't understand what all the fuss was  
about. It's perfectly appropriate for HUD to explore any idea that 
improves the safety of public housing residents and reduces the 
money the federal government must spent on security, said Rep. 
Henry Waxman, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be in a fury over the fact that HUD may be thinking of  
something some of them don't like is certainly a strange notion,'' 
Waxman said. ``The Republican leadership is willing to jump to 
defend their friends ... even though some of their friends make 
products that kill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I see no justification for calling a hearing based upon a  
newspaper article,'' Rep. Patsy Mink, D-Hawaii, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-three cities and counties, including Los Angeles, Chicago  
and New Orleans, have filed suits accusing gunmakers of failing to 
equip weapons with adequate safety devices and marketing them in 
ways that allow handguns to fall into the hands of criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the NAACP filed suit against nearly 100 handgun makers  
in federal court, seeking injunctions that would place sweeping 
restrictions on handgun sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Laster said department officials have responded to questions  
from public housing authorities contemplating or involved in the 
suits. 
</P>
<P>
	And the department has conferred with private attorneys to  
increase its understanding of the issue, Laster said. A HUD lawyer 
traveled to a New York law firm last week for discussions, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun manufactures testifying called the suits fundamentally  
unfair. 
</P>
<P>
	``We make a lawful product,'' said Jeff Reh, general counsel for  
Beretta USA Corp. ``We sell that product as requested by the 
public, in accordance with procedures set by the same federal 
government that is now talking about suing us for relying upon the 
very distribution system that the federal government established.''

<HEADLINE> Japan, S. Korea Hold Naval Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- In what is seen as a countermeasure to  
growing military threats from North Korea, longtime rivals Japan 
and South Korea held a joint naval exercise today for the third 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	The drill, the first joint military exercise between the two  
countries, was conducted amid fear that North Korea is preparing to 
test a long-range ballistic missile. The reclusive regime 
test-fired a missile last August that flew over Japan and landed in 
the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-day exercise, a mock search and rescue of a wrecked  
civilian vessel in international waters, is being held in the East 
China Sea between Japan's southwestern island of Kyushu and South 
Korea's Cheju Island, off the southwestern coast, the Defense 
Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The drill involves a destroyer, an escort vessel and a  
helicopter from South Korea, and three destroyers, one patrol plane 
and three helicopters from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry emphasized that the exercise, involving 1,200 South  
Korean and Japanese sailors, was for peaceful purposes. It blocked 
media coverage, however, saying it did not want to provoke North 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	The North denounced the exercise, insisting it was aimed at  
starting a war. 
</P>
<P>
	``The exercise is ... aggressive and criminal in its nature,''  
the North's official Korean Central News Agency said Tuesday. It 
added that the maneuver was targeted at the North ``under the 
simulated conditions of a real war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We will never tolerate (those) who are persisting in such  
military actions. If they finally provoke a war against the DPRK 
while staging the reckless military exercise, they will have to pay 
dearly for it and suffer a miserable defeat,'' the news agency 
said. North Korea refers to itself as the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea, or DPRK. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense ministers of the two nations agreed to conduct the  
exercise when they met in Tokyo last September to discuss security 
issues, spurred in part by North Korea's firing of a missile in 
August over Japan into the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	The North says it put a scientific satellite into orbit, but  
Western officials said the launch was a test-firing of a Taepodong 
I missile that could strike anywhere in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has accused North Korea of preparing to  
test-launch another missile, reportedly a Taepodong II missile with 
a range of up to 3,700 miles, which could reach as far as Hawaii 
and Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, a spokesman for North Korea's Foreign Ministry  
warned it would test-fire a missile if the United States stepped up 
pressure on the isolated communist state. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came shortly after U.S. Defense Secretary William  
Cohen's visit last week to Japan and South Korea, where he urged 
the North to postpone its missile launch or face further economic 
and diplomatic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite prospering economic ties, Japan and South Korea have had  
little military exchanges because of their turbulent history. Japan 
ruled the Korean peninsula as a colony in 1910-1945, and distrust 
and animosity still run deep among the people of both countries.

<HEADLINE> Pats Owner Sponsors Israeli Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- They live in Israel, they work in Israel, they  
speak Hebrew and they serve in the Israeli army -- but they crave 
American football. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 American expatriates turned out Wednesday to cheer  
Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, at the 
groundbreaking for Israel's first touch football field. Kraft is 
donating money to build the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Touch football is a taste of the old country for homesick  
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	When Yonah Mishan, 27, a plumber, immigrated from Los Angeles in  
1984, no one played the game here. ``I really missed it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arieh (``The Animal'') Bauman. who runs a steakhouse, said he  
once won a football scholarship to Penn State. Instead, he 
immigrated to Israel and joined the paratroops, intending to go 
back to Penn State later. But he was wounded in the knee while 
fighting in south Lebanon and had to give up his college football 
dream. 
</P>
<P>
	His old fire for the game is reflected in his nickname. He's  
known for going after opposing quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to now, touch football has been played on underdeveloped  
soccer fields here. ``This has caused unnecessary injuries, made it 
very difficult to train youth and stunted the development of the 
sport,'' said Steve Leibowitz, chairman of ATFI, the American Touch 
Football Association. 
</P>
<P>
	At Wednesday's ceremony, Kraft donated $120,000 to transform one  
of those soccer pitches into a real touch football field. The Kraft 
Stadium will have new turf, new fences, plastic seats in the 
bleachers and lights for weeknight games. 
</P>
<P>
	When Leibowitz founded ATFI ten years ago, it had eight teams  
and 120 players. Now it has 33 teams and 500 players. Almost all 
are American immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	That might change. A growing number of Israelis watch American  
football on television. All the Patriots games are screened on a 
local channel. 
</P>
<P>
	Kraft believes that when the new stadium is built, young  
Israelis will be attracted to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Israelis have never had an opportunity to see football under  
the right conditions, but when they get exposed to it and get a 
feel for it, I'm sure they will want to play,'' he told The 
Associated Press.

<HEADLINE> Hutchinson Technology To Cut Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUTCHINSON, Minn. (AP) -- Hutchinson Technology Inc. will cut 500  
jobs at its plant here and increase employment at plants in South 
Dakota and Wisconsin as it consolidates some manufacturing 
operations, the company said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	To improve efficiency and cut costs, assembly operations now  
based in Hutchinson will be transferred to the company's plants in 
Eau Claire, Wis., and Sioux Falls, S.D., the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson Technology is the leading worldwide supplier of  
suspension assemblies for computer disk drives, which supports the 
mechanism that allows users to read from and write to the hard 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
	The job cuts represent a little more than 6 percent of  
Hutchinson's 8,000-member work force. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees whose jobs are eliminated will be offered severance  
packages and help in finding new jobs. The company also said it 
will offer relocation assistance to Hutchinson employees interested 
in jobs that become available at the company's other plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson Technology will take a charge in its fiscal fourth  
quarter ending Sept. 26 to cover the consolidation.

<HEADLINE> Halle Berry Plays Dorothy Dandridge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It was a Saturday in Cleveland, and Halle  
Berry tuned in the local UHF channel for the afternoon movie. 
</P>
<P>
	The black-and-white screen sparkled with Dorothy Dandridge  
singing and dancing in the 1954 film ``Carmen Jones,'' featuring an 
all-black cast. Berry, then 18 and living in an all-white suburb, 
was transfixed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wow, everybody else in this movie is black, too, and they're  
talented and beautiful,'' she recalls thinking at the time. ``This 
seems like a happy place. I want to go wherever they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And so she did.  
</P>
<P>
	She stars in ``Introducing Dorothy Dandridge,'' a drama about  
the tragic actress-dancer-singer who was the first black woman 
nominated for an Academy Award as best actress. The movie debuts 
Aug. 21 on HBO. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry, who also served as an executive producer, spent six years  
trying to persuade Hollywood studios to take on the project. When 
she couldn't get a deal, she turned to cable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in love with Dorothy since the moment I saw her,''  
says Berry. ``I remember seeing how beautiful she was, of course, 
and then how charismatic and how fiery and what a talented actress 
she was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intrigued by this woman from her own hometown of Cleveland,  
Berry visited her local library to glean more about the actress. 
Sadly, she found only a one-sentence reference to the Oscar 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``That fueled my passion,'' Berry says. ``I didn't have many  
images of what black life was like growing up, so it was 
fascinating to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bringing Dandridge's life to the screen also appealed to singers  
Whitney Houston and Janet Jackson, who reportedly were interested 
in doing their own versions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Among the African-American community, well, this is a major  
story,'' says Martha Coolidge (``Lost in Yonkers,'' ``Rambling 
Rose,'' ``Out to Sea''), who directed the HBO movie. ``Why isn't 
the white community so aware of how great a story this is? Why do 
we have to introduce Dorothy anyway? We should all know her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During production, Dandridge's manager, Earl Mills, and best  
friend Geri Branton, dropped by with their memories of the woman 
they called ``Dottie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so comforting to have them there and be able to ask  
them, `Am I doing good?''' Berry says. ``Their stamp of approval 
was all I cared about because they knew her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dandridge, whose mother was an actress, entered show business at  
age 4, singing and dancing with her sister Vivian (Cynda Williams). 
She was a regular on the radio show ``Beulah,'' danced at the 
Cotton Club and made her screen debut in 1937 in the Marx Brothers 
classic, ``A Day at the Races.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The HBO movie details her marriage to the phenomenal tap dancer  
Harold Nicholas, played by Obba Babatunde, and the birth of their 
retarded daughter, as well as bigotry and her starring role in 
``Carmen Jones,'' where she captured the heart of Otto Preminger, 
the film's married, white director (Klaus Maria Brandauer). 
</P>
<P>
	``He became like putty in her hands because she was strong and  
he was attracted to her strength,'' Berry says. 
</P>
<P>
	During their affair, Preminger promised Dandridge they would be  
together publicly when the world was ready for an interracial 
couple. He later walked out on her. 
</P>
<P>
	``We grow up thinking we're going to find Prince Charming,''  
says Berry, who was divorced in 1997 from Cleveland Indians player 
David Justice. ``I know what that feels like -- to grow up wanting 
that and not being able to catch it, but always trying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dandridge's career careened off-course, and a second marriage,  
to nightclub owner Jack Dennison (D.B. Sweeney), ended after he 
physically abused her. (As a teen-ager, Dandridge was sexually 
assaulted by her mother's female friend, who was checking to see if 
the girl had lost her virginity during a date.) 
</P>
<P>
	``She was so torn down from the abuse she suffered ... that I  
don't think she thought she had anything else to offer but her 
beauty,'' Berry says. ``That was the real tragedy of her life. She 
was so smart and she was so strong, but she didn't know it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Dandridge retained her feistiness. She called Preminger  
``a big, fat bulldog'' when he bullied her into doing ``Carmen 
Jones,'' based on the Bizet opera. She told off studio head Daryl 
Zanuck, who told her she would be a huge star. And during an 
engagement at the Riviera hotel in Las Vegas, Dandridge was told 
``colored'' people were not allowed to use the pool. Defiantly, she 
dipped her toe in the pool, which later was drained and scrubbed. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of her Oscar nomination, she made the cover of Life  
magazine. But she lost the award to Grace Kelly, and, because 
Hollywood did not offer leading lady roles to black actresses, she 
was unable to parlay her nomination into other credible parts. 
Depressed, Dandridge began drinking and popping pills. 
</P>
<P>
	Even for black actresses today, lead roles are few. The next  
project for Berry, who co-starred with Warren Beatty in 
``Bulworth,'' is ``The X-Men,'' based on a cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Dandridge was a talented singer and dancer, two things Berry had  
never before studied. She learned to tap dance during three months 
of lessons. Singing was another matter: Wendy Williams provides 
vocals in the movie for such classics as George Gershwin's ``I've 
Got Rhythm'' and Cole Porter's ``You Do Something to Me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dandridge was bankrupt by the early 1960s. She was 42 and  
attempting to resurrect her career when she died from an overdose 
of a prescription antidepressant in 1965, the year before Berry was 
born. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was slowly killing herself for the last five years of her  
life and finally one day it caught her,'' Berry says. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Microsoft To Help Navajo Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft is giving a $1.2 million grant to fund  
technology training for teachers in 12 Navajo school districts in 
Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, the company announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	The grant to the Navajo Education Technology Consortium will  
help match a five-year, $7.6 million national Technology Innovation 
Challenge Grant awarded earlier this year to the consortium by the 
U.S Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
	It aims to provide training for teachers in the use of  
technology in the classroom, Microsoft said in a statement today. 
</P>
<P>
	The consortium currently serves 2,750 teachers and 45,000  
students on Navajo reservations in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	``Technology infrastructure at the nation's Indian reservations  
has long been neglected,'' said Larry Shaw, project director of the 
Education Technology Improvement Plan, as the grant plan is 
formally named. 
</P>
<P>
	``These grants will go a long way to ensure that our students  
and teachers are on an equal playing field in terms of access to 
technology and the training necessary to advance themselves 
academically and professionally,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The software giant also will provide software to four training  
centers to support the initiative.

<HEADLINE> Rock Beat: Johnnie Johnson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Johnnie B. Goode is back, and he's bad.  
</P>
<P>
	While most rock stars' heyday is in their youth, blues and  
boogie pianist Johnnie Johnson is approaching his 75th birthday and 
his popularity is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	He's no longer just known as the Chuck Berry sideman who  
inspired Berry's famous ``Johnny B. Goode.'' Nearly half a century 
after he first took the stage, Johnson's stepping out from Berry's 
shadow and gaining acclaim as a solo blues star. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's adopted hometown of St. Louis recently honored him  
with a weeklong celebration, including a jazz festival and birthday 
party. And his ``Father of Rock 'n' Roll: The Johnnie 'B. Goode' 
Johnson Story,'' was recently published. 
</P>
<P>
	It took years and some crusading by modern rock musicians to  
push Johnson into the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	His biggest break came in 1987 during the compilation of a Chuck  
Berry documentary called ``Hail, Hail Rock 'n' Roll.'' During the 
filming, Johnson met Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones who urged 
Johnson to pursue his solo career. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, Johnson released his first solo album,  
``Bluehand Johnnie.'' The albums ``Johnnie B. Bad'' and ``Johnnie 
Be Back'' followed. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came a push from Houston businessman George Turek to get  
Johnson into Cleveland's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Turek, CEO of 
the physicians management service company MES Group, had hired 
Johnson to play at his wedding and quickly became a fan. 
</P>
<P>
	Turek even ran an advertisement in Billboard magazine featuring  
a letter to the hall-of-fame nominating committee to persuade them 
of Johnson's talent and influence. It was signed by other 
inductees, including Bo Diddley, John Lee Hooker, Little Richard 
and Etta James. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Hall of Fame said it didn't have a category in which to  
fit Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Inductees are nominated for work done in their own name or with  
a group. Even though Johnson collaborated with Berry on songs, the 
credit is given to Berry. Johnson's solo albums have only been 
released in the last decade, so it's too early for him to be 
nominated individually. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson isn't discouraged.  
</P>
<P>
	With Turek's help, ``the wheels have been going forward. I'm  
getting more exposure,'' Johnson said in a recent interview. ``Now, 
with the book, that'll be icing on the cake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was born in West Virginia and began playing the piano  
when he was 5 years old. He joined his first band, Blue Rhythm 
Swingsters, when he was 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson served in World War II and came to the St. Louis area  
after playing for three years in Chicago with top blues players. In 
1952, the young musician was in East St. Louis when a member of his 
band fell ill before a New Year's Eve gig. The replacement he hired 
was guitarist Chuck Berry. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest is musical history.  
</P>
<P>
	The duo wrote rock 'n' roll classics like ``Mabelline'' and  
``Roll Over, Beethoven.'' Johnson composed the music on piano, 
Berry converted it to guitar and wrote the lyrics. They blended 
blues, boogie and country to form the genre that helped shape rock 
music in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	``When rock 'n' roll came in strong, it was really the guitar  
players that brought it in -- Chuck and Elvis Presley,'' Johnson 
said. Being the sideman to Berry never bothered him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Today Johnson has tapped into a surge in the popularity of the  
blues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, it seems like blues and jazz are the outstanding  
types of music,'' Johnson said. ``I've met quite a few young 
musicians. All these kids who are starting to play now are focusing 
on learning the blues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's latest CD, due out in a couple of months, will be his  
seventh. Atlantic Records also is lining up artists for a special 
tribute album in Johnson's honor. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as I can lift a hand to play, I'll be playing,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> SEC Sues Texas Investment Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Federal regulators sued a Texas investment firm  
Wednesday charging it with fraud that may have cost investors up to 
$475 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in  
federal court in San Antonio against InverWorld Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents from the FBI, the SEC and the IRS executed search  
warrants at the business offices of InverWorld and its chairman, 
Jose P. Zollino, in connection with a criminal investigation, an 
FBI spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC lawsuit and the search warrants are the latest  
developments in an emerging scandal surrounding InverWorld, which 
catered mostly to wealthy investors in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	In late June, InverWorld affiliates in Great Britain and the  
Cayman Islands told investors they were closing and freezing all 
accounts. Those affiliates are now in liquidation proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said InverWorld, Zollino, 51, company President George  
F. Fahey, 62, and three affiliated companies may have lost 
investors' money through risky, unauthorized investments. The 
lawsuit also charged that an affiliate company issued practically 
worthless securities to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	According to related court filings by InverWorld affiliates, the  
company had as many as 1,000 investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said InverWorld's clients were interested in low-risk  
investments outside Latin America, including money-market accounts 
and U.S. Treasuries, but that InverWorld put their money in risky 
investments in ``volatile emerging markets'' and with entities 
closely related to InverWorld. It said fraudulent statements 
concealed the nature of the investments from clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Allan Diamond, a Houston lawyer who said he is representing  
about 100 investors who put more than $100 million in InverWorld, 
said the SEC charges are similar to what clients have told him. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of questions of what else happened, given the  
size of the losses,'' Diamond said. ``Everyone believed they were 
investing money in safe investments that would have reasonable 
yields and they could rely on in their retirement. You had people 
putting their life savings in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lamont Jefferson, a Dallas lawyer for InverWorld's domestic  
companies, said the investments were all in accordance with 
contracts signed by the investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been bad investments in global markets. It's a  
risky business, and you can lose money in those markets,'' 
Jefferson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson said he didn't know how the money was lost, whether it  
was one bad investment or a series of smaller ones. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC is seeking a freeze of assets at the companies, civil  
penalties and a repayment of funds. It asked that a temporary 
receiver be appointed to oversee InverWorld. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials said some of the securities sold to investors  
were issued by IWG Services Ltd., an InverWorld affiliate in London 
that was essentially a mail drop -- it had no offices or employees. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the SEC, InverWorld, Zollino and Fahey used IWG and  
Cayman Islands-based IG Services Ltd. as ``shells'' to move money 
beyond the reach of investors and regulators. The SEC said $210 
million was transferred to Swiss and Bahamian bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the SEC, only $90 million in securities may remain.  
</P>
<P>
	Zollino was unavailable for comment. The phone went unanswered  
at InverWorld's headquarters Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	InverWorld has had previous problems with the Internal Revenue  
Service, which is trying to collect $380 million it says InverWorld 
owes in back taxes and penalties for allegedly shifting income 
earned in the United States to foreign subsidiaries.

<HEADLINE> Early Start Slows U.S. Basketball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Starting a basketball game at 10 a.m.  
was a little too early for the U.S. men. Around 10:30 would have 
been just right. 
</P>
<P>
	That extra 30 minutes was how long it took them to wake up  
Wednesday as the United States beat the Dominican Republic 95-83 to 
finish unbeaten in the preliminary rounds of the Pan American 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Travis Williams scored 24 points to lead the Americans (3-0),  
who trailed by 20 with seven minutes left in the first half before 
rallying with the help of a full-court press. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was our first early game and we just had to wake up,''  
Williams said. ``I think what woke us up is when we looked up and 
were down by 20. I was thinking, help me get this thing over 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States will play in the semifinals Friday night for  
the right to advance to Sunday's gold medal game. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. women, who already had qualified for the medal round,  
used solid defense to beat Canada 62-46 and finish 3-2 in 
preliminary play. Their semifinal opponent Thursday night is Cuba, 
which beat the Americans 95-64 Saturday, the worst loss ever for a 
U.S. women's team in Pan Ams play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being as we lost the way we did against Cuba, none of us liked  
it too well,'' U.S. forward Dana Wynne said. ``We were all looking 
forward to playing Cuba again and having the opportunity to show 
they're not 30 points better than we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For quite some time, the American men weren't better than the  
Dominican Republic, which hit three 3-pointers, converted a 
three-point play and had a four-point possession during a 20-4 run 
that produced a 45-25 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those guys had played three morning games, so I think they  
were a little more adjusted to it,'' U.S. coach Mo McHone said. 
``They just came out shooting the ball. They made some tough shots 
early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McHone then went to a smaller, faster lineup and it worked. The  
Americans forced seven turnovers while outscoring the Dominicans 
27-6 and trailed only 53-52 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams scored nine points and had two steals during the run.  
Mikki Moore had three dunks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach gave us the green light to press after every made basket  
and that's what we started doing,'' Williams said. ``The team 
picked up on that and we just took it from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Hawkins' 3-pointer gave the United States the lead for  
good, 70-67, with 10:20 remaining, and the Americans pulled away at 
the end as the Dominican team wore down. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawkins and Doug Smith each scored 13 points, Moore had 12 and  
Carl Thomas 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The American women weren't sharp offensively but held Canada to  
18 points and 22.6 percent (7-for-31) shooting in the second half. 
Canada (2-3) trailed 37-33 early in the second half before the 
Americans went on a 21-4 run to break it open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought our defensive effort was good,'' U.S. coach Nell  
Fortner said. ``We were there. I think we had a lot to do with why 
they missed shots. I thought our defense was just tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States played without two of its top interior  
players, 6-foot-5 Sylvia Crawley and 6-3 Danielle McCulley, both 
ill with the flu. That forced Wynne, Amy Herrig and Katryna Gaither 
to play extra minutes against Canada's physical front line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just trying to do everything I could do to help us come  
out with a victory, whether it was scoring, rebounding, setting 
good screens or defense,'' said Wynne, who had five points and 
three rebounds. ``We're a team. When one falls down, another steps 
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michelle Marciniak led the Americans with 17 points and Edwina  
Brown scored 15.

<HEADLINE> Singer Gans Signs Mirage Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Entertainer Danny Gans remembers moving here  
three years ago, dreaming of headlining on the Las Vegas Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	That dream was realized Tuesday when it was announced that Gans  
had signed an eight-year, multimillion-dollar contract with Mirage 
Resorts Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stand before you as proof that dreams do come true,'' Gans  
said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Gans has been the headliner at the Rio Suite Hotel and Casino  
since January 1997. The Mirage announcement comes just days after 
former teen idol David Cassidy was named as the Rio's new 
headliner. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans call for Gans to debut at the Mirage on April 1. The  
financial terms of his contract were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Gans is scheduled to release a new CD of Christian pop music in  
February. The filming of a Gans TV sitcom pilot, set in Las Vegas 
and produced by Aaron Spelling, was delayed until the fall of 2000 
to allow him to get settled at The Mirage.

<HEADLINE> Bids May Hit $1M for Domain Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- What's in a name? At least $260,000 so far,  
and maybe more than $1 million if the name is Drugs.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric MacIver, a 21-year-old Internet entrepreneur in Mesa,  
Ariz., stands to reap the windfall from drug companies' bidding for 
rights to the Internet domain name to which he owns the exclusive 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Intense bidding under way for the name highlights the  
competition among companies seeking the right name to lure 
customers in the increasingly crowded world of electronic commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	By Wednesday afternoon the highest confirmed bid was $260,000,  
but several large drug companies and well-heeled speculators have 
expressed an interest in bidding before the auction closes Friday 
evening, MacIver said in a telephone interview from his office. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very hard to spell Bausch &AMP; Lomb, but if they get  
Drugs.com, as I see it, it helps brand their name,'' he said, 
referring to the big health products company. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys make hundreds of millions of dollars a year in this  
industry. There's one chance to get it. If I were in that industry 
I'd consider $1 million a bargain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Greatdomains.com, one of two online brokers  
handling the auction, said confidentially agreements prevented them 
from releasing names of bidders, or saying whether Bausch &AMP; Lomb 
was among them. 
</P>
<P>
	Several major companies have verbally committed to bids well  
above $260,000, however. Greatdomains, based in Los Angeles, and 
Dotbroker.com, the other broker involved in the sale, were in the 
process of confirming the bids on Wednesday, said Jeff Tinsley, 
Greatdomains' chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies require bidders to back up verbal bids with a  
written contract. The agreement then must be reviewed by the 
seller's attorneys before the bid becomes official. 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies had inquired, but appeared to be waiting for the  
last day to better gauge the market, said Tinsley. 
</P>
<P>
	Bids were expected to exceed $1 million, he said. In May, the  
name Wallstreet.com was sold for $1 million to a Venezuelan 
company. And last year Compaq Computer Corp. paid $3.35 million for 
the name AltaVista.com for its AltaVista search engine. Since then, 
Compaq sold a controlling stake in the search engine to the 
Internet investment company CMGI Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are anticipating a big frenzy because we have been  
contacted by quite a few companies that are interested in making an 
offer: big drug companies, big venture capital companies,'' said 
Tinsley. 
</P>
<P>
	The activity is not surprising. Companies seeking an Internet  
presence are scrambling to find domain names that are easy to 
remember and likely to appeal to customers, said Preston Dodd, an 
analyst with Jupiter Communications in New York. But a successful 
site requires more than just a name. 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of building the brand itself, there obviously could  
be a huge head start. It's even easier to remember than 
1-800-Flowers,'' said Dodd. ``It's not a silver bullet. They have 
to build a brand around it and they have to build awareness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In May, MacIver purchased on option to buy the name from Bonnie  
Neubeck, owner of a Minneapolis Internet marketing company. That 
deal means MacIver will get the lion's share of the auction price 
for Drugs.com. Mrs. Neubeck is entitled only to the option price. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, I'm not going to get all that money. I had the  
purchase price negotiated in May,'' said Mrs. Neubeck, who has sold 
other domain names for six-figure amounts. 
</P>
<P>
	She put the name up for sale several months ago, after watching  
the online pharmaceuticals market grow. At the time, MacIver's 
company, Sandline Productions, was planning to launch an online 
drug sales business. He later scrapped the plan and decided to put 
Drugs.com up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither she nor MacIver would say how much he paid to buy the  
name. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits from the sale will be plowed back into Sandline, a  
five-person Web site design and programming company MacIver founded 
18 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to retire,'' he said. ``With the sale of this  
name, I'm just going to put it into Sandline and help it grow 
more.''

<HEADLINE> Subpoena Sought for Justice Dept. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prompted by the case of a Mexican drifter  
suspected in nine killings, a Republican lawmaker is seeking to 
subpoena Justice Department information about crimes committed by 
immigrants after their release from previous arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, has not received data he requested in  
mid-July, shortly after Angel Maturino Resendez surrendered to 
authorities in El Paso, Texas, a Smith spokesman said. The 
Immigration and Naturalization Service came under fire for allowing 
Maturino Resendez, suspected to be the ``railroad killer,'' to slip 
repeatedly through its fingers. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's letter to Attorney General Janet Reno requested the  
information be delivered by July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	As chairman of the House Judiciary immigration subcommittee,  
Smith will ask fellow members for the subpoena today, spokesman 
Alan Kay said. 
</P>
<P>
	A majority of the subcommittee's members must approve the  
request, and the Judiciary Committee chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde, 
R-Ill., must sign it before a subpoena can be issued. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokeswoman Carole Florman had no immediate  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The July 14 letter from Smith said the Maturino Resendez case  
``has spotlighted the serious and long-standing problem of the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service's releasing from custody 
dangerous criminal aliens who then commit additional crimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter asks Reno for data on immigrants who had previously  
committed crimes that could make them eligible for deportation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please provide me, by July 31, 1999, detailed information  
regarding inadmissible or deportable criminal aliens who, during 
the past five years, were released from INS custody and then 
subsequently convicted of additional crimes in the United States,'' 
the letter said. ``Please provide detailed information identifying 
all such criminal aliens and setting out their histories of 
criminal activity and interaction with the INS.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Justice Department does not keep such information, the  
letter said, ``please explain why this is so and what is being done 
to remedy this omission.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Convicted of Burning Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A woman was convicted of killing her  
15-year-old son by throwing a cup of kerosene on him and lighting 
because she was angry that other children in the apartment made 
noise while she tried to sleep. One of the boy's last acts was to 
drag his mother to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Annie Pollard was found guilty of second-degree murder Tuesday  
by a Circuit Court judge, who said he will sentence her in a few 
weeks. She could be sentenced to up to life in prison with 
possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Her son Lamar was fatally burned on Dec. 16, 1997. Ms. Pollard  
had been drinking, police said. One of the children, now 11, 
testified that Lamar and his mother argued before Ms. Pollard 
tossed the kerosene on him and set it on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	In flames, Lamar ran around the second-floor flat, the child  
said. Then he and his mother tried to put out the flames with water 
from the bathtub. But by then, the fire had spread to one of the 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The six children got out and Lamar dragged his mother to safety.  
Lamar died 35 days later of respiratory problems from burns that 
covered 60 percent of his body. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Pollard had said the death was accidental. She said kerosene  
had spilled on the boy during a quarrel. She didn't know how the 
fire started but testified that she had lighted a kerosene heater 
to warm the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	She had been charged with first-degree murder, but the judge  
said he found no evidence that Ms. Pollard had deliberated before 
setting the fire.

<HEADLINE> NAACP Stokes Flag Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The NAACP, which suggests tourists avoid  
South Carolina because the Confederate flag still flies over the 
Statehouse, is prepared to take the fight further. 
</P>
<P>
	The civil rights group has amassed campaign records to learn  
which companies have donated money to lawmakers who want the flag 
to stay. Supporters say the flag represents South Carolina's 
heritage and honors its war veterans; The NAACP considers it a 
symbol of slavery and racism. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at all of them, but especially those who have  
taken a public position in favor of leaving the Confederate battle 
flag flying,'' said Dwight James, executive director of the 
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's South 
Carolina branch. 
</P>
<P>
	James wouldn't reveal how the organization planned to use the  
information. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina, the only state with the Confederate battle flag  
flying above its Capitol, raised it at the Statehouse in 1962 to 
commemorate the Civil War's centennial. Several attempts to take it 
down have failed, including a lawsuit by business leaders.

<P>
	Former Gov. David Beasley campaigned to remove it and lost in  
the November election. Democratic Gov. Jim Hodges, who promised not 
to revive the issue, said the Legislature lacks the political will 
to tackle it now. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the NAACP called for the travel boycott last month, the  
National Urban League and the Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference both have canceled convention plans in the state. There 
are no official estimates of the boycott's impact. 
</P>
<P>
	NAACP officials this week began reviewing the financial  
disclosure forms filed by 14 senators and seven House members, most 
of whom have favored keeping the flag above the Capitol dome. Among 
those targeted were five black lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just curious as to who is supporting the people who  
didn't support our efforts,'' said Jim Wiggins, the NAACP's state 
branch manager. He said the group planned to examine all lawmakers' 
financial disclosure forms. The forms, required by law, list 
political contributions, income and business connections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently they don't think their boycott will work and so now  
they're looking for some other tactic to resort to,'' said Sen. 
Glenn McConnell, R-Charleston, a flag supporter who owns a 
Confederate memorabilia gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the black lawmakers targeted by the NAACP, state Sen.  
Robert Ford, suggested the Confederate flag stay and the black 
liberation flag, designed by black nationalist leader Marcus 
Garvey, be flown next to it. A black representative, Brenda Lee, 
said she could support moving the flag to a memorial on Statehouse 
grounds.

<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The King of All Media couldn't conquer Twin  
Cities radio. 
</P>
<P>
	WRQC-FM dropped shock jock Howard Stern's New York-based  
syndicated radio show Tuesday because of low ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Howard never got the numbers we hoped for, wanted and  
needed,'' said Marc Kalman, general manager of the station. 
</P>
<P>
	While Stern remains one of the most popular morning radio  
figures in the country, some observers said his humor doesn't play 
as well in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Stern's brand of being outrageous just to be  
outrageous didn't fly,'' said Tom Moon, director of operations for 
Duncan's American Radio, a radio research company in Cincinnati.

<HEADLINE> House Backs States Power on Liquor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- States would gain new control over liquor,  
beer and wine shipments across their borders under a bill passed by 
the House that also aims to prevent minors from illegally buying 
booze by direct mail or the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents charged that it would only benefit beverage  
wholesalers and distributors, who control such sales, at the 
expense of small wineries and breweries that depend on alternative 
avenues to get their products to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted, 310-112, to pass the bill that would let state  
attorneys general go into federal court for injunctions to stop 
illegal, direct shipments of ``intoxicating liquors'' to residents. 
The measure was sent to the Senate, which included a similar 
provision in the juvenile justice bill it passed in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Wholesalers support the bill as a way to maintain control over  
distribution and sales, but winemakers eager to find new markets 
outside of distributorships opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law gives states the right to regulate distribution and  
sales of alcoholic beverages and 19 states ban their direct 
shipment to residents from out of state. 
</P>
<P>
	Most states require alcohol producers to go through  
state-licensed wholesalers, who sell to retailers, who then may 
sell to the public. But states are having a hard time enforcing the 
laws because they do not have jurisdiction over out-of-state 
defendants, the legislation's supporters said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet will no longer be a bootlegger's paradise,'' said  
Rep. Joe Scarborough, R-Fla., a prime sponsor of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal also will help states collect taxes, said Rep.  
William Delahunt, D-Mass. Illegal shipments of alcoholic beverages 
cost states $600 million in revenue last year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents said the bill really protects wholesalers and  
distributors. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. George Radanovich, R-Calif., owner of a central California  
winery, said mail order and Internet sales help small vintners stay 
in business and meet consumer demand since many wholesalers will 
not carry small lots of their merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Calif., called the bill a ``wolf in sheep's  
clothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill is about wholesalers and distributors that don't  
want small wineries to move into their turf,'' said Woolsey, who 
represents wine-making regions of the state. ``They've got it all 
tied up and they don't want to give any of that up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters, however, rejected those criticisms and statements  
that the legislation would hurt electronic commerce and wouldn't 
prevent minors from using the Internet to buy alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., said there were ``numerous documented  
instances'' of minors using the Internet to buy alcohol. ``For 
anybody to claim otherwise, they are simply misleading this 
debate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing this bill does is stop the illegal shipment of  
alcohol into states. Nothing more, nothing less,'' added 
Scarborough, the sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats injected the gun control issue into the debate with  
amendments to give state attorneys general the same right with 
regard to interstate shipments of firearms. The amendments were 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 2031.

<HEADLINE> Mattel To Sell Barbie Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Barbie and Hot Wheels are riding into the  
Internet age. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel Inc. said Tuesday it will launch a line of computers tied  
to its popular doll and toy car brands, the latest move by the 
world's largest toy maker to expand its high-tech offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	The company announced a licensing agreement with Patriot  
Computers to produce brightly colored personal computers for $599 -- 
including the central processing unit, monitor and 20 software 
titles. The new computers will go on sale Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole toy industry is moving toward technology and this is  
just the latest example of that,'' said Chris Byrne, a toy 
consultant. ``These computers pair Mattel's best-known brands with 
a very affordable PC. That's bound to attract buyers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel's entrance into the computer market comes as the El  
Segundo, Calif.-based company aggressively pursues opportunities 
outside traditional toys, like CD-ROMs and high-tech gadgets, which 
children today seem more interested in playing with than dolls and 
action figures. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Mattel has seen tremendous growth in its lineup  
of software and CD-ROMs, while demand of its Barbie dolls have been 
on the decline. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Mattel Media accounted for six of the top 10  
best-selling software titles focusing on personal enrichment, 
according to research firm PC Data. Mattel Media includes products 
from The Learning Company, an educational software firm that Mattel 
acquired earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	While its software sales are strong, Mattel hopes its new  
computers will help it grab a piece of the fast-expanding cheap PC 
market. Almost 71 percent of all PCs purchased retail in June sold 
for under $1,000, compared with 46 percent of sales in the same 
month a year ago, PC Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are making technology affordable for the masses,'' said  
Cynthia Neiman, vice president of marketing for Mattel Media. 
``Where else can you get a computer, monitor and software for under 
$600?'' 
</P>
<P>
	With its low prices, Mattel is targeting not only those families  
buying their first computer, but also those looking to buy a second 
home PC. According to ZD InfoBeads, a research firm in La Jolla, 
Calif., 65 percent of U.S. households with children own a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	``More and more, consumers have a powerful computer for all of  
the household activities, and want a cheaper computer for a 
specific member of the family, like the kids,'' said Matt Sargent, 
an analyst at ZD InfoBeads. ``This fits perfectly into that 
market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each full-sized computer will include a 333 MHz Intel Celeron  
processor, 15-inch monitor, 56K modem, a 3-gigabyte hard drive and 
a Windows 98 operating system. While it is hardly the most powerful 
computer on the market today, analysts said it rivals that of other 
PCs in its price range, such as the popular eMachines and Compaq 
Computer's low-end model. 
</P>
<P>
	The Barbie PC comes in silver with pink and purple flowers. It  
features 20 entertainment and educational software titles, 
including the Barbie Riding Club CD-ROM, Barbie Cool Looks Fashion 
Designer CD-ROM and Compton's Encyclopedia. 
</P>
<P>
	The package also includes the popular Barbie digital camera, a  
Barbie mouse and a CD holder. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue and gold Hot Wheels PC comes with 20 titles such as Hot  
Wheels Stunt Track Driver, Hot Wheels Customer Car Designer and 
Compton's 3D World Atlas. The package also includes a Hot Wheels 
steering wheel. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel said the library of software loaded on each PC has a  
retail value of approximately $500. Copies of the software will 
also be provided. 
</P>
<P>
	The new computers will be sold exclusively through Patriot, a  
privately held Canadian direct-seller of computers, and two Web 
sites, at www.barbiepc.com and www.hotwheelspc.com. The computers 
will not be available in stores.

<HEADLINE> Consequences of Predator Removal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	House cats and other small animals are becoming the dominant  
predators in San Diego's rugged canyons, replacing wild coyotes 
driven away by urban development, researchers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Because cats, opossums, skunks and raccoons are no longer preyed  
on, they are free to eat more rodents and birds, threatening their 
populations, said biologist Kevin Crooks, co-author of the study in 
today's journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	``Predators like coyotes are often persecuted by humans, but  
they can have important ecological roles,'' Crooks said. 
``Sometimes you can't predict what kind of roles they play until 
they disappear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For two years, Crooks and his colleagues surveyed about 30 of  
San Diego's canyons that are rural oases in the sea of the city's 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	They found that where coyotes still live, dead felines were  
found in most of those areas and 21 percent of coyote droppings 
contained cat remains. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the coyote threat disappears, more felines are allowed  
to roam and hunt on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one has really looked at this particular relationship  
before,'' said Lee McClenaghan, professor of biology at San Diego 
State University. ``It shows if you destroy habitat and remove 
components of an ecosystem, effects are seen throughout.''

<HEADLINE> Bush To Meet Hispanic Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Texas George W. Bush, who angered  
Hispanic-Americans by declining to address their convention in 
Houston, will meet this week with Hispanic leaders in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides say Thursday's meeting had been on the schedule for weeks  
and was not designed to repair any damage that might have resulted 
from his decision not to attend the National Council of La Raza 
convention last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting originally was scheduled to be private and wasn't  
announced until Wednesday, after it was decided to open up the 
session to reporters, the aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor has been very diligent about bringing his  
campaign and his ideas to the Hispanic community in Iowa and he'll 
continue to do,'' spokesman Eric Woolson said. ``The campaign has 
been working very closely with members of the Hispanic community to 
bring them into the campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An Iowa State University study in 1997 said Hispanics made up  
1.9 percent of the state's population, with 53,092 Hispanic 
residents. They are the fastest growing of any minority population, 
increasing from 1.2 percent in 1990, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has made a courtship of Hispanic voters an important part  
of his campaign for the GOP presidential nomination, routinely 
delivering part of his stump speech in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush had told La Raza officials that he could not attend the  
convention because he was vacationing his family. However, his wife 
interrupted the family vacation the following day to campaign in 
Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor also declined to speak at a meeting of  
minority journalists in Seattle, though he was campaigning in that 
city at the time. He did make a brief appearance at that event. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, who also routinely speaks Spanish on the  
stump, addressed both groups. Latinos are a growing and influential 
voting group that generally favors Democrats, but Bush has made 
some inroads in Texas. He carried nearly half the Hispanic vote in 
winning re-election last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush opened his latest campaign swing through Iowa in a carnival  
atmosphere, speaking Wednesday to about 500 supporters at a 
lakeside park in Clear Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	But he touched only briefly on the theme of Hispanic voters,  
noting that test scores have improved in Texas ``particularly among 
African-American and Latino children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before an almost entirely white audience, he decided against  
delivering a portion of his speech in Spanish. Hammering basic 
campaign themes, he said, ``We can give this great country a fresh 
start after a season of incredible cynicism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woolson said the meeting Thursday with leaders of the Hispanic  
community initially was a private session, but campaign aides 
decided to open it to reporters and it was added to the public 
schedule. He insisted there was no connection to earlier incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Allowing reporters into the meeting clearly raises the profile  
of the encounter, however, and it likely will become central to 
news accounts of Bush's swing, which otherwise is filled with 
routine campaign events. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has met with Hispanic leaders in earlier campaign swings,  
but reporters have not been allowed in those sessions.

<HEADLINE> Mazda To Raise Pay of 500 Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Mazda Motor Corp. says it will award raises to  
about 500 women and promote two or three women to management in an 
effort to erase the sexual discrimination that is still common in 
Japanese offices. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still a Japanese way of thinking in the company, and  
women weren't being utilized fully,'' Mazda spokeswoman Nobuko 
Watanabe said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda studied the performance and skills of 1,000 women  
employees and found that 500 deserved either promotions or a better 
job grade that determines their salaries, Watanabe said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, two or three women will be promoted by this fall to  
the lowest managerial position, called assistant manager, a title 
now held by 2,300 men and only four women. Others will get raises. 
</P>
<P>
	The top managerial position held by women up to now has been  
section chief, but there are now only three women among 700 section 
chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda, a Hiroshima-based automaker that is 33.4 percent owned by  
Ford Motor Co., employs 1,400 women, mostly clerical workers, 
making up about 6 percent of the work force. It has about 90 women 
plant workers -- 60 of them hired this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Women in Japan still face major hurdles when trying to move up  
the corporate ladder. Many companies push women to quit when they 
marry or when they reach their mid-30s. 
</P>
<P>
	A majority of Japanese companies say they do not allow women in  
management positions because of ``lack of knowledge and judgment,'' 
according to a recent Labor Ministry survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Women headed 60,593 firms in June, just 5.3 percent of Japan's  
1.14 million companies, according to a survey by Teikoku Data Bank, 
a Tokyo research company. 
</P>
<P>
	Rewarding workers according to their productivity is still a  
relatively new concept in many Japanese companies. The traditional 
seniority system automatically gives workers pay raises as they get 
older. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Japan's top automaker, Toyota Motor Corp. said it  
will start a new pay system based on performance rather than 
seniority in October.

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Reports to AAA Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry, set to join the New York  
Yankees' Triple-A Columbus team today, says his latest comeback 
will be his last. 
</P>
<P>
	``There won't be another,'' Strawberry told the New York Post as  
he prepared to begin his fifth comeback since being released by the 
Los Angeles Dodgers in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's 120-day suspension for his arrest on solicitation  
and drug charges April 14 was reduced by baseball commissioner Bud 
Selig on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry said he was having a tough time when he was arrested.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was in a very bad place as far as the way I was thinking,''  
he told The Post. ``Everything was real complicated and I had a 
tough time thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry said he became depressed when he was told he wouldn't  
be on the Yankees' Opening Day roster, and stopped going to 
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learned again that I am a recovering alcoholic and can't  
miss meetings ever,'' he said. ``I am no different than any other 
alcoholic. If I don't go to meetings, I am going to drink.' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry said he hasn't had a drink since the day he was  
arrested, and is eager to resume his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling good and I'm ready to get on with my life,''  
Strawberry said on Monday. ``I'm starting to get into the frame of 
mind of playing. I'm looking forward to it. I'm ready to get 
going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he prepared to face live pitching for the first time since  
March, Strawberry said he didn't know how long he would be with 
Columbus before he is summoned to The Bronx again. 
</P>
<P>
	``One day at a time, that's the way I look at everything now,''  
he said. ``That's the way I look at life and baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry had a brief chat with Yankees owner George  
Steinbrenner and homered on the last pitch of batting practice to 
wrap up his final workout day in Tampa on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very grateful Mr. Selig has given me the opportunity to  
get back to baseball and just move forward with my life,'' said 
Strawberry. ``The whole situation is behind me now and I just want 
to concentrate on what I have to do on the field. Hopefully, I can 
help the ballclub throughout the remainder of the season.''

<HEADLINE> `Illuminata' Is a Family Affair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John Turturro is star, director, co-writer and  
co-producer of ``Illuminata.'' But it is far from a one-man show. 
</P>
<P>
	The film follows a theater company in early 1900s New York as it  
performs a new play written by Turturro's character, Tuccio. 
</P>
<P>
	``To build or create anything, you need more than one person,''  
Turturro said during an interview. ``Most movies are about one or 
two people and that's it. This has so many characters that are 
interwoven, it's like any real-life community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turturro and co-writer Brandon Cole completed the screenplay in  
1994. But they needed to attach some high-profile actors to the 
project before they could get it made. 
</P>
<P>
	``People always liked the script, but that's the problem with  
almost any movie -- you need a movie star to get a movie funded,'' 
Turturro said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ensemble cast includes Susan Sarandon, Christopher Walken,  
Ben Gazzara and Beverly D'Angelo. Casting was based on Turturro's 
instinct, using actors he admires. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking for people who could be inventive but people who  
you could also feel their heart and warmth,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the director of ``Illuminata,'' Turturro had to be even more  
passionate than usual about this project. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to sustain yourself five times as long -- from  
beginning to end -- and you're involved in every little aspect. In 
this film, I was never bored at all because every aspect and every 
person interested me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The on-screen community must have felt familiar to Turturro. His  
wife, Katherine Borowitz, is his leading lady; his cousin, Aida, is 
a member of the fictitious repertory company; his son, Amadeo, 
plays one of the young boys who lives with the company; and several 
of his Yale University classmates filled acting or production 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
	A central theme is the difficulty of making love last after  
infatuation has worn away. Setting the film within a theater 
company allowed the characters to exaggerate. But the beauty, lust 
and ridiculous behavior is rooted in reality, Turturro said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to make a film -- even though there is all this  
metaphor -- that actually resonates with what people go through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``Women are in all of the powerful positions, more or  
less. And the men are trying to act powerful. That's how it really 
is. Only in the movies do you see the woman crying and the man 
swings in to save her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turturro wrote the film with Borowitz in mind, describing his  
wife and her character as strong and confident, yet very feminine.

someone to relate to.''

<P>
	However, ``Illuminata'' is not the Turturro-Borowitz story. That  
would be ``too boring,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Turturro has appeared in three dozen films. He is currently  
working on a new film with George Clooney. He has struck a 
professional balance that gives him enough clout in Hollywood to 
open doors but still maintain his everyday life in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some people who are really pure `movie stars,' but  
the whole idea of that doesn't really appeal to me as a person,'' 
he said. ``I think it's a very limiting position to be in. Life 
isn't like that, and we all have to have contact with other 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daily life for Turturro, 42, doesn't include pampering and  
comparing box-office grosses. Instead, he prefers to take his son 
to school, go to the gym, read a newspaper and run an errand for 
his wife. Sometimes, he'll even catch a matinee movie -- even though 
he finds watching his own films with an audience nerve-racking. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get to live interesting existences when I'm doing a movie,''  
he said.

	Stocks Close Lower; Dow Down 2.54  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks collapsed in the final  
half-hour of trading today, deflating a rally fueled by the news of 
a $9.3 billion merger of Dow Chemical and Union Carbide. The Dow 
Jones industrial average closed down 2.54 at 10,674.77. The Dow, 
following what is becoming a familiar pattern, gave up nearly all 
its gains late in the day and wiped out what had been a 152-point 
advance. The broader market, plagued by fears of inflation, 
declined much more steeply. The Nasdaq composite index fell 48.07 
to 2,539.92. Analysts said the market fell prey to continuing 
worries that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in an 
attempt to stave off inflation.

	Dow Chemical To Buy Union Carbide  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Dow Chemical Co., the maker of Styrofoam, is  
buying Union Carbide Corp., the leader in producing the chemicals 
used in making polyester and antifreeze. The $9.3 billion deal 
announced today would create the world's second-largest chemical 
business behind DuPont Co., strengthening Dow's perch in a sluggish 
chemical market beset by depressed prices. The merged company, 
which will operate under the Dow Chemical name, will have $24 
billion in annual revenue, putting it ahead of the current No. 2, 
Germany's BASF AG, according to the most recent rankings by 
Chemical Week magazine. About 2,000 jobs will be cut as a result of 
the merger, leaving about 49,000 employees. Shares of Dow were at 
118 5/8, down 6 1/16; Union Carbide was at 59 3/8, up 10 9/16 or about 21 
percent.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Greater demand for autos and electronic  
equipment helped push orders to U.S. factories up 0.7 percent in 
June. It was the 10th gain in the last 13 months, and it is seen as 
a fresh sign that the manufacturing sector is recovering. The 
figure announced by the Commerce Department today followed a 1 
percent gain in May. The June rise was larger than many analysts 
had anticipated.

	Chase Buys Mellon's Mortgage Outfit

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chase Manhattan Corp.'s mortgage subsidiary has  
agreed to purchase the residential mortgage business of Mellon 
Bank, N.A. Chase was the nation's third-largest residential 
mortgage originator last year, writing $85 billion in new loans, 
while Mellon originated $8 billion. Chase moved to first place in 
the first two quarters of this year, passing Countrywide and 
Norwest Mortgage. With the acquisition, Chase would rise to first 
place from third in servicing residential loans, surpassing Bank of 
America and Norwest, said Steve Kim, research director at Inside 
Mortgage Finance, an industry newsletter. Shares of Chase Manhattan 
were at 78 7/16, down 3/8.

	Clinton Promises To Veto Tax Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today promised to veto a  
Republican plan that would lower the tax rate of every American who 
pays income tax. He called the bill ``risky and plainly wrong for 
America.'' The 10-year, $792 billion tax cut package put together 
by House and Senate Republicans would gradually cut 1 percentage 
point off each personal income tax rate. It also would provide 
relief from the so-called marriage penalty, cut the individual 
capital-gains tax rate and eventually eliminate the estate tax.

	Exec: Auto Biz Needs New Talent  
</P>
<P>
	TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) -- The auto industry faces ``a  
potentially devastating shortage of talent'' worldwide and must 
change its outdated image to attract the highly skilled workers it 
needs, a top Ford Motor Co. executive said today. Vice Chairman 
Peter Pestillo told an industry conference that the general public, 
including educators and students, has a perception of auto 
manufacturing is a second-class industry taking place in dark, 
dirty environments, He added that the auto work force is perceived 
as uneducated and unskilled. ``We need to do a better job of 
informing the outside world that our industry offers opportunities 
for forward-thinkers.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Honda Vows To Stay Independent  
</P>
<P>
	TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) -- Honda Motor Co. is committed to  
remaining independent despite the trend toward consolidation of the 
auto industry, president Hiroyuki Yoshino said today. Speaking at 
an industry conference, Yoshino disputed the conventional wisdom of 
industry executives that only large, global automakers with great 
economies of scale will survive in the 21st century. Yoshino said 
Honda does not need to merge with another automaker to expand its 
global presence. It already has 100 plants in 34 countries, part of 
its longstanding policy of developing and building cars, 
motorcycles and other motorized products in the markets where 
they're sold.

	Share Prices Mixed in Europe Trading  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Share prices were mixed on European stock  
exchanges today as rising steel stocks were offset by a drop in 
some technology and telecommunications shares. Dealers said steel 
shares were buoyed by hopes of a price increase and by news that 
plans for a merger between British Steel and Amsterdam-based steel 
manufacturer Hoogovens are on track. The Dow Jones Basic Resources 
index was the best performer on the day, with a gain of 2.3 
percent, as British Steel shares rose 4 pence to 170.45 pence and 
Hoogovens shares rose 1.80 euros to 56.70 euros. The Dow Jones Euro 
Stoxx Index, which tracks 297 companies in countries that have 
joined the single currency, closed down 0.99 points at 309.43.

<HEADLINE> Century of Change for Chinese in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Fred Lau always wanted to be a San  
Francisco cop, so much so that he literally hung upside down in 
hopes of getting the job. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1970, there was a height requirement to join the police force  
and the 5-foot-7 Lau was an inch short. He tried hanging upside 
down from a bar to stretch his body. It didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
	What did work was pressure from civil rights activists. The city  
dropped the height requirement in 1971 and Lau became the 
department's fifth Asian American officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Lau is chief of police. His rise through the ranks is in  
many ways a reflection of a century of change for Chinese 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, Chinese Americans have among the highest median  
household incomes and education levels of any ethnic group in the 
United States, prompting some to call them the ``model minority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the anti-Chinese sentiment in America that traces back to  
the frontier days remains a constant friction, according to many 
Chinese Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``People always make fun of my accent,'' said Kenny Su, 49, a  
Hong Kong native who has lived in America for 10 years. ``They 
don't have a good image of Chinese people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recent high-profile scandals haven't helped. Some Chinese  
Americans fear allegations of Chinese espionage at nuclear weapons 
labs and illegal contributions by China in U.S. political campaigns 
is eroding their progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., referred to ``a crafty people''  
when talking about the spy scandal. Some editorial cartoons about 
the issue have featured images of bucktoothed Asians with thick 
glasses. An editorial in one newspaper evoked the image of Fu 
Manchu, the cunning, mustached and slant-eyed stereotype from Sax 
Rohmer's novels. 
</P>
<P>
	``It only shows that to a certain extent, some of this stuff is  
just below the surface,'' said Victor Hsi, a vice president of the 
Organization of Chinese Americans, a Washington, D.C.-based civil 
rights group. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the first Asians in the United States were Chinese  
miners who came through San Francisco during the Gold Rush. As 
outsiders, they were seen as an economic threat. 
</P>
<P>
	A tax of $2.50 a month on all Chinese living in California was  
passed in 1862 to ``protect free white labor.'' Twenty years later, 
the Chinese Exclusion Act barred Chinese laborers from entering the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strategy was to declare these Asian immigrants as  
unassimilatable and treat them like foreigners, and that pretty 
much has stayed with us until today,'' says Ling-chi Wang, chairman 
of the Ethnic Studies Department at the University of California at 
Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, there have been laws preventing Asians from  
owning land, gaining citizenship and marrying whites. Doubts about 
the patriotism of Japanese Americans led to their internment in 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, Asian Americans now number 10.1 million, about 3.8  
percent of the U.S. population. But their influence and presence is 
growing. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40 percent of the students at the University of  
California are Asian Americans. That's a long way from early this 
century, when nobody would rent to the first Chinese American 
students at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	Over in Silicon Valley, a quarter of the high-tech businesses  
are run by Asian entrepreneurs. With those numbers, the image of 
the model minority seems true -- to a degree. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very rare if you apply for a job with a Chinese surname  
that someone would toss your application in the garbage can like 
they did 30 years ago,'' says Diane Chin, executive director of 
Chinese for Affirmative Action. ``But there are many glass ceilings 
out there that are still largely ignored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One impediment, say Chinese Americans, is the perception that  
they are skilled in technical fields but don't have what it takes 
to reach top management. 
</P>
<P>
	A study by the Boyden Global Executive Search of Washington,  
D.C. showed that Asian Americans hold only about 1 percent of the 
board seats at the 1,000 biggest public companies in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief of Police Lau broke through another glass ceiling.  
</P>
<P>
	Abolishing the San Francisco department's height restriction  
gave Lau a chance to fulfill a dream and be a pioneer. He is the 
only Chinese American to lead a big city police department. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that it's a very strong position, it's a very visible  
position and a very non-Asian position is very important,'' Lau 
said. ``It's very contrary to the stereotype.''

<HEADLINE> Spielberg Honored for Grant Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Academy Award-winner Steven Spielberg is being  
honored for some of his lesser-known exploits. 
</P>
<P>
	The filmmaker will be given the Smithsonian Associates' annual  
James Smithson Bicentennial Medal next Wednesday in Washington. The 
award is named for the British scientist whose 1846 bequest to the 
United States financed the start of the Smithsonian Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg was chosen for his work establishing the Righteous  
Persons Foundation, a grant-making organization dedicated to 
strengthening Jewish life, and the Survivors of the Shoah Visual 
History Foundation, created to preserve the stories of Holocaust 
survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am both surprised and deeply honored to be designated for  
such a prestigious medal from an institution that is a national and 
international treasure,'' Spielberg said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Past award recipients include the late ocean explorer Jacques  
Cousteau, former first lady Lady Bird Johnson, filmmaker George 
Lucas and TV newsman Walter Cronkite.

<HEADLINE> Casino Reprimanded for Leach Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A casino restaurant has been reprimanded for  
hosting a party where Robin Leach allegedly cavorted with naked 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delmonico Steakhouse could have lost its liquor license for  
the May 31 incident. The Clark County Commission instead gave it an 
administrative reprimand on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation by the department found that the former host of  
``Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous'' and five female companions 
engaged in ``lewd conduct'' while attending a party in a private 
room. Several employees witnessed the party because the room was 
enclosed in glass windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Leach has said the allegations were a ``gross exaggeration'' and  
no sexual acts took place. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a harmless fun whipped-cream fight that lasted less  
than two minutes when dessert was served,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse, who owns Delmonico, called  
Leach's behavior ``outrageous'' and apologized for the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``It happened, and I take responsibility. It happened with a  
breakdown in command,'' he said. ``Who would ever dream something 
this bizarre would happen?'' 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for the restaurant said Leach, 57, has been told he  
is no longer welcome at Delmonico, several employees have been 
fired and some have been reprimanded.

<HEADLINE>  U.S. Courses on Garcia's Itinerary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND BLANC, Mich. (AP) -- He is only 19, but Sergio Garcia has  
known for some time that to be a great golfer he must play in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, for only the fourth time, Garcia plays in a pro  
tournament in the United States. His appearance in the Buick Open 
will be a tuneup for next week's PGA Championship and possibly the 
final hurdle for his PGA Tour card. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always said that I'd like to be a global player,'' Garcia  
said Wednesday before practice at Warwick Hills Golf and Country 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``When I was young I said if I wanted to be recognized  
as a good player I have to go to the States. ... Everything is big 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, who has just gotten his driver's license and is looking  
forward to graduating high school, is still plenty young. And he's 
also plenty talented, as he's shown in Europe and America. 
</P>
<P>
	He's already getting tips from Tiger Woods, less on golf than in  
handling sudden fame. Garcia has a shot at making the European 
Ryder Cup team, and a top 10 finish this week in the Buick would 
all but guarantee the Spaniard a PGA Tour card for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia appears to thrive on the parkland courses common to the  
PGA Tour and has had trouble on the windswept links courses of 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	He tied for 38th at this year's Masters, tied for third at the  
GTE Byron Nelson Classic and tied for 11th at the Memorial 
Tournament. He's won more than $200,000 on the U.S. tour, placing 
him 128th on the U.S. money list. He needs to finish the year 125th 
or better to secure his card for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be recognized as Sergio Garcia, not a European Tiger  
Woods,'' Garcia said, speaking slightly accented but fluent English 
he has studied since he was 9. 
</P>
<P>
	He plays an exciting brand of golf, a long-driving,  
go-for-the-pin approach, and he can rack up birdies in a hurry. He 
says he's starting to be recognized in public and so far enjoys 
signing autographs. 
</P>
<P>
	He'd surely get a different view from the besieged Woods, who is  
skipping this week's event to prepare for the PGA at Medinah 
Country Club outside Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia is not yet ready to choose between Europe and the United  
States. He's also exploring tournament opportunities in Asia. But 
his words suggest a tilt toward America. He likes the courses, the 
competition, the money and the exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	At last month's British Open, where he shot 89-83 to miss the  
cut, Garcia said he preferred U.S. courses. On those course, a 
straight drive is rewarded; on links courses, bumps, swales and 
blind shots kick a straight drive into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buick Open, with a $2.4 million purse and $432,000 first  
prize, is important because of its proximity to the PGA 
Championship and next month's Ryder Cup in Brookline, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Crenshaw, the U.S. captain, will make his final two picks  
following the PGA, with the other team positions based on 
tournament performance. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the field features such big names as two-time  
Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal, Ernie Els, Justin Leonard and 
defending champion Billy Mayfair. U.S. Ryder Cup aspirants in the 
field include Jim Furyk, Jeff Maggert, Chris Perry, Steve Stricker 
and John Huston.

<HEADLINE> Separated Shoulder Sidelines Ismail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA FALLS, Texas (AP) -- Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail's debut  
with the Dallas Cowboys is on hold as the receiver slightly 
separated his left shoulder Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're calling it day-to-day, but it looks like it'll be closer  
to a week before we actually get him back on any type of full-time

	Gailey said Ismail definitely will not play Monday night in the  
team's exhibition opener, the Hall of Fame game against the 
Cleveland Browns in Canton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Ismail was injured while trying to catch a pass in a morning  
workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw it and it didn't look so bad, so I wasn't that  
concerned,'' Gailey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ismail joined the Cowboys as a free agent in April. The former  
Oakland Raiders and Carolina Panthers player cashed in on the two 
best seasons of his career by signing a $21.5 million, seven-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys are counting on Ismail's speed from the slot  
position to help open things up in their offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Troy Aikman said Ismail is the fastest, most  
polished receiver he's had in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had other guys with that speed before, but they've been  
projects, guys who we were just hoping could come in and provide us 
with a weapon,'' Aikman said. ``He's shown he can play in this 
league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Ismail heals in a week, the soonest Aikman and Ismail could  
hook up in a game is Aug. 15 in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Having Ismail line up inside allows the Cowboys to keep Michael  
Irvin outside, where he's thrived most of his career. Irvin has 
said he ``felt like a rookie'' playing the slot last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Ismail returns, he'll be replaced on the first team by  
Ernie Mills, who is recovering from a November injury that ended 
his 1998 season.

<HEADLINE> Customs To Change Search Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dogged by investigations and lawsuits alleging  
abusive searches, the Customs Service is revising its policies for 
checking airline passengers for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs already has posted new signs and brochures at airports  
explaining why body searches might be required and offering people 
comment cards to use in the event of mistreatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the agency is revamping its handbook and internal policies  
on personal searches, work that may be completed soon, law 
enforcement officials said Tuesday. They spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	An independent panel created in April to review the policies and  
procedures used by customs inspectors to search for drugs also is 
expected to release its findings soon, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	They would not discuss any specific changes under consideration.  
</P>
<P>
	Customs officers use searches to try to catch smugglers who hide  
cocaine or heroin inside their clothes or swallow packets of drugs. 
The searches usually begin with a pat-down and, with reasonable 
suspicion, can proceed to a strip search, X-ray or monitored bowel 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, the Customs Service announced that six major  
airports will be getting new high-tech scanning machines that will 
let inspectors see whether a passenger may be concealing illegal 
drugs. Inspectors could use the machines rather than performing the 
other kinds of searches. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency is facing numerous lawsuits over body searches,  
including suits, first reported by The Associated Press last 
December, alleging that people were singled out because of their 
race and gender. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 50,892 of the 71.5 million international air travelers who  
passed through customs in 1998 were subjected to some level of body 
search, most of them simple pat-downs, customs officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those whose race was recorded, almost as many blacks and  
Hispanics as whites were subjected to the more serious strip or 
body cavity searches or sent to hospitals for X-rays in 1998, 
customs has said. A year earlier, 50 percent more blacks and 
Hispanics were subjected to those searches than whites. 
</P>
<P>
	For those subjected to such searches or X-rays, drugs were found  
on 30 percent of blacks, compared with 31 percent the year before; 
27 percent of Hispanics, down from 33 percent; and 19 percent of 
whites, down from 26 percent in 1997, customs has said. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, President Clinton ordered federal law enforcement  
officers, including customs, to document the race and gender of 
those they arrest or detain.

<HEADLINE> Ravens' Woodson Switches Positions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTMINSTER, Md. (AP) -- Rod Woodson spent the past 12 years  
doggedly pursuing the very best receivers in the NFL, zigging when 
they zigged and zagging when they zagged. 
</P>
<P>
	After 47 interceptions, 164 games and seven Pro Bowls, the  
future Hall of Famer is ready to take a break. 
</P>
<P>
	Retirement? Not a chance. Woodson, 34, is doing the next best  
thing, though -- this season he has moved from cornerback to safety 
for the Baltimore Ravens. The switch is an indication that he's 
lost a step, but Woodson has absolutely no complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, he no longer walks off the field at training camp  
with his tongue hanging out and sweat pouring down his face. And he 
knows he doesn't have the legs to keep up with young cornerbacks 
Chris McAlister, Duane Starks and DeRon Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
	``The coaches want to try the young guys and I understand that.  
They know I can play corner and now they want to see what I can do 
at safety,'' Woodson said. ``I'm fine with that. Safety is a lot 
easier than corner (and) it's a lot easier on the body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woodson last played safety at Purdue in the mid-1980s. Drafted  
in the first round by the Pittsburgh Steelers, he was converted to 
cornerback and went on to become one of the finest ever to play the 
position. After spending a decade in Pittsburgh and one season in 
San Francisco, he joined the Ravens as a free agent last season and 
recorded a team-high six interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as his career winds down, Woodson is getting reacquainted  
with the view from far off the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing safety is fun. It's different,'' he said. ``I just  
want to help the team win. I always thought I was a natural safety, 
anyway. At corner, you have to be ready to run on every play. At 
safety, you run, but you can gamble a little more and kind of pick 
and choose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New coach Brian Billick is apprehensive about beginning the  
season with a trio of cornerbacks that have a combined three years 
of NFL experience, but having Woodson in the backfield makes him 
feels a little better about the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the athletic ability we have outside and the experience  
that Rod has, he ought to be able to hold things together back 
there,'' Billick said. ``Rod at safety, it just fits where he is in 
his career and I think he recognizes that. That doesn't preclude 
him from going to the corner in certain situations, but right now 
it's the best use of his abilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woodson's value to the Ravens goes beyond interceptions, tackles  
and swatting away passes. Because he's played a dozen years and the 
rest of the backfield is relatively young, Woodson is also playing 
the role of an on-the-field teacher and coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been blessed with a lot of fine coaches who have taught  
me a lot about the game of football. I think it would be very 
selfish on my part if I didn't give something back to the guys,'' 
he said. ``I'll give them my input and they can take it for what 
it's worth.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton: No Excuse for Infidelity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Wednesday his childhood  
was no ``bed of roses'' but that it was no excuse for bad behavior 
as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, campaigning for the Senate, said she hadn't meant to  
imply that childhood ``abuse'' explained away his infidelity. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Clintons said they ``love each other very much.'' Clinton  
added an extra ``very.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's comments were his first public remarks on  
Hillary Rodham Clinton's magazine interview, in which she drew an 
apparent link between the chaos of Clinton's Arkansas boyhood and 
what she described as his ``weakness'' and lack of self-control as 
an adult. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe that anybody could fairly read the article and  
think that she was making any excuses for me,'' Clinton said. ``I 
have not made any excuses for what was inexcusable, and neither has 
she, believe me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His comments came in answer to a reporter's question at the  
close of a Rose Garden appearance on economic themes, including the 
GOP-passed tax cut bill. 
</P>
<P>
	During a visit to Jamestown, N.Y., Mrs. Clinton sang much the  
same tune. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is responsible for their behavior, and I am a very  
strong proponent and believer in personal responsibility, so I hope 
that people will take that message away from this,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters later he knew  
of no plan to coordinate the Clintons' statements. 
</P>
<P>
	The first couple's comments were meant to quiet the hubbub about  
Mrs. Clinton's reference to childhood ``abuse'' in an interview in 
the debut issue of Talk magazine. She said Wednesday she believes 
the country has put the issue of the Clintons' marital problems 
behind it, and ``I have as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Talk interview was described by people close to Mrs. Clinton  
as a political calculation: lay out her thoughts on the Monica 
Lewinsky sex scandal now, and the issue will be less troublesome 
later in the 2000 Senate race the first lady is considering. 
</P>
<P>
	Without naming Ms. Lewinsky, Mrs. Clinton said of her husband in  
the interview, ``Yes, he has his weaknesses. Yes, he needs to be 
more responsible, more disciplined, but it is remarkable given his 
background that he turned out to be the kind of person he is, 
capable of such leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Expanding on her husband's background, Mrs. Clinton said he was  
scarred at age 4 by a struggle between his mother and grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
	``A psychologist once told me that for a boy being in the middle  
of a conflict between two women is the worst possible situation,'' 
she said. ``There is always a desire to please each one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Biographical accounts of Clinton's childhood describe a willful,  
powerful grandmother, ``Mammaw,'' and her hold on both her widowed 
daughter, Clinton's mother Virginia, and her grandson. 
</P>
<P>
	In her autobiography, Clinton's mother also recounted a power  
struggle with her mother, much of it while the young Clinton and 
his mother lived with his grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton looked pensive Wednesday as he spoke about his childhood  
in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have a bed of roses as a kid,'' Clinton said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think every reflective person thinks about his or her  
life,'' he added. ``But what I conclude about my childhood is what 
I said. It had its really tough moments, but I always knew I was 
well-loved, and I think that's important for all of our children.''

<HEADLINE> Dodgers To Stay in Vero Beach </HEADLINE>

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Dodgers will hold spring  
training in Vero Beach, Fla., for at least one more year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers made the announcement Wednesday, saying they have  
formally declined the Fort McDowell Tribal Council's final proposal 
to construct a spring training facility on the Fort McDowell 
Yavapai Reservation in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers have conducted spring training at Dodgertown in Vero  
Beach every year since 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	``Together, we have made every effort to explore the various  
alternatives which would have enabled us to move our spring 
training operations to Fort McDowell,'' Dodgers president Bob 
Graziano said in a statement. ``Although we were unable to accept 
the Council's final proposal, we certainly appreciate the magnitude 
of the commitment that this project would have required from the 
people of Fort McDowell. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our plans are to continue our discussions with city and county  
officials in Vero Beach and to conduct spring training in 
Dodgertown in the year 2000.''

<HEADLINE> Tribes Seek Money for Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American Indian tribes now run about half of  
the health care and other programs once managed by the federal 
government, but tribes have not gotten enough money to manage them, 
tribal leaders told a House committee on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The total shortfall for tribes' administrative costs was less  
than $200 million a year, said Dr. Michael Trujillo, director of 
the Indian Health Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, chairman of the House Resources  
Committee, said some of the blame lies with the budget-writing 
committees in the House and Senate, which have not provided the 
money needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a commitment. There is an entitlement. There is an  
obligation,'' Young said. ``The amount of money isn't that big. 
It's one cruise missile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 1975 federal law allows tribes to take over management of  
hospitals, clinics, law enforcement, social services, land 
management and other programs once run by the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs, the Indian Health Service or other government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, however, requires the government to provide enough  
money to pay for the tribes' overhead and startup costs for taking 
over those programs. Tribal leaders and officials in the Clinton 
administration, say Congress has not provided enough money to cover 
these costs for most of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Several tribes are suing the federal government to force it to  
pay all administrative costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indian Health Service, for example, now pays tribes between  
70 percent and 80 percent of the money they need to run health 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	At Arizona's Gila River Indian Community, officials are  
considering cutting back ambulance service from 24 to eight hours a 
day because there is not enough money to cover management costs, 
tribal Gov. Mary Thomas told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Gila River took over most of its reservation health programs in  
1996, but did not get paid for administrative costs until last 
year, when the tribe got 56 percent of what was needed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of money for administrative costs is just one example  
of how Indian programs are underfunded, said Kevin Gover, assistant 
Interior Department secretary who heads the BIA. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would need to triple our budget to meet the programmatic  
objectives given to us by Congress,'' said Gover, who urged the 
panel to pass legislation to give tribes more money to cover 
administrative costs.

<HEADLINE> Vikings Rookie Remains AWOL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANKATO, Minn. (AP) -- Dimitrius Underwood might have cost  
himself a job with the Minnesota Vikings by failing to return to 
training camp Wednesday as promised. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, a first-round draft pick, went AWOL after his first  
pro practice on Monday but apologetically called his agent 24 hours 
later saying he'd needed to tend to a family crisis and was on his 
way back to camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, who signed a five-year, $5.3 million contract on  
Sunday, was absent from Wednesday's workouts, too, leaving coach 
Dennis Green stewed and general manager Tim Connolly stumped. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not talked to him at all,'' Green said. ``We've got a  
football camp here. He knows where it's at and he knows where his 
room is. He is not here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green insisted Underwood's absence didn't distract the team.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our football players love the guys that are here and they  
don't care one bit about the guys that aren't,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although his tone suggested otherwise, Green said he wasn't  
angry. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I'm focused on the football team,'' he said. ``I think  
every young man has a right to do what he wants to do, that's part 
of being a man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first thing Underwood would have to do upon his return is  
meet with Green, who would decide whether to take him back. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone doesn't want to be here, there's no way that we can  
force him to be here,'' Connolly said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings have already acted to move on without Underwood.  
</P>
<P>
	They went to federal court in Minneapolis Tuesday to keep him  
from getting the more than $500,000 after-taxes bonus that was 
wired to his bank in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	And they informed the league they had placed him on the  
active-left squad list, meaning Underwood has until Sunday to 
return or his season would be finished and his salary terminated. 
</P>
<P>
	If he returns, he could face fines of up to $5,000 per day  
missed and the team could also try to recover some or all of his 
signing bonus of $1,725,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Connolly said he didn't know what would happen.  
</P>
<P>
	``Denny makes the personnel decision and frankly (Underwood's)  
missing and it's impossible for us to have a dialogue,'' Connolly 
said. ``Of course, Denny's going to move on. Denny has to worry 
about this football team. We've got 81 other guys to worry about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A message left with Underwood's agent, Craig Domann, wasn't  
immediately returned Wednesday. Domann's voice mail said he was out 
of the office all day. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday night, Domann said that Underwood planned to meet  
with Green either that night or Wednesday morning. ``He apologized 
for his unprofessional exit without telling anybody that he had an 
urgent family matter,'' Domann said. 
</P>
<P>
	Domann declined to go into specifics about the player's  
explanation or the whereabouts of Underwood, a 6-foot-6, 276-pound 
defensive end from Michigan State and the 29th selection in the NFL 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood left without explanation Monday after a forgettable  
performance in his first workout. He left his personal possessions 
in his dorm room and caught a cab to the Minneapolis-St. Paul 
Airport 90 miles north, where he apparently bought a ticket to 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never had a player leave without letting you know, even  
though it happens, it's not unusual,'' Green said. ``There have 
been many stories of guys with their suitcase bouncing down the 
steps as they snuck out in the middle of the night. That wasn't the 
case. He left during the middle of the day and he didn't take his 
clothes with him.''

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors: Judith Michael </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- What do you get when you combine journalist  
Judith Barnard and aerospace engineer Michael Fain? Best-selling 
novelist Judith Michael. 
</P>
<P>
	The husband-and-wife team have combined their names, her  
penchant for writing and his flair for the more methodical -- 
translation: editing -- into 10 best-selling novels that blend a 
love story with fantasy, reality and adventure. 
</P>
<P>
	At their spacious 16th-floor apartment overlooking Chicago's  
Lincoln Park and their home in a secluded section of Aspen, Colo., 
the pair have most recently completed ``A Certain Smile,'' the 
story of a widowed fashion designer who travels to China where she 
puts inhibitions aside and falls in love. 
</P>
<P>
	Their writing adventure began after they were married in 1979.  
They met in the corridors of a hospital. ``Bittersweet times as 
Michael's mother was dying and we were falling in love,'' Barnard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnard already had written educational films, textbooks and a  
novel. Once married, the two began collaborating on magazine 
articles that appeared in publications such as Redbook and Good 
Housekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ... had such a good time working together that one day  
Michael said, 'Enough of this! Why don't we write a book?''' 
Barnard recalled as she sat on a sofa beside Fain in the living 
room in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The thought of giving up magazine writing to gamble the next two  
years on a novel frightened Barnard. ``I said, 'I would rather keep 
getting checks all the time.''' 
</P>
<P>
	But they pushed ahead, and in 1982, the first Judith Michael  
book, ``Deceptions,'' was published. In 1985, it was made into a TV 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
	The book was a success, but money wasn't the only consideration.  
Writer-editor relationships are often tense. And when the editor is 
the writer's husband? 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very difficult to have a working relationship with this  
person who you think has done really dumb things that day and is 
going to be in your bed,'' Barnard says. 
</P>
<P>
	While both acknowledge their endeavor was difficult at first,  
conflicts eased once both gained confidence. ``Michael learned how 
to give criticism and I learned how to take it. ... We really don't 
fight about'' it anymore, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	When tempers did soar, Fain, a photographer, would retreat to  
his darkroom, while Barnard, an avid cook, headed to the kitchen. 
``She would knead bread and take out her aggressions on the 
bread,'' Fain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, the couple, now in their 60s, have learned to  
respect each other's privacy and feelings. Both of their homes have 
his-and-her offices, each with its own library. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want either one of us to look at the other and say,  
'Why aren't you working?' which is what we did at the beginning,'' 
Barnard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Chicago offices offer views of the city's skyline and house  
personal objects -- a chess game in his, a collage her father made 
in hers. 
</P>
<P>
	Their home reflects the things they love. A mural depicts an  
Aspen scene. Art books rest atop a piano. A wall leading to the 
offices is lined with black-and-white photographs Fain has taken of 
a Holocaust memorial in Israel, an Aspen waterfall, a Chicago 
cemetery and more. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple's creative process begins with brainstorming until  
they agree on a general plot and characters. Then they write a 
summary, which always includes a fantasy such as winning the 
lottery. 
</P>
<P>
	They always travel to the countries they write about -- China,  
Switzerland, Australia, Egypt, Italy, France, Canada, England. In 
China, for example, they toured a food market the book's heroine 
also would visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Barnard begins writing and Fain starts editing.  
</P>
<P>
	``That means writing it about six times because everything gets  
edited,'' Barnard said. ``It takes longer to write with two people 
than one,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	Fain, who also does technical research and scene-writing,  
believes the writing partnership has strengthened their marriage, 
``because it's made us think about how we interact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he doesn't think it's for everyone. ``It takes a certain  
person, a set of personalities,'' he said. ``It also takes a real 
desire to want to do it. And it's difficult. ... But when it works 
like for us, it's wonderful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnard offers a more lighthearted view:. ``It probably kept us  
married because we always had a book to finish. You can't leave if 
you're in the middle of a book. And then, by the time the book is 
done, the tension is gone so you don't remember even what you were 
arguing about.''

Derek Anderson's asking price for a contract extension, traded him 
and Johnny Newman to the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday for 
Lamond Murray. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, 25, was entering the final year of his three-year  
rookie contract. The 6-foot-6 guard was seeking a seven-year, $60 
million extension from the Cavs. 
</P>
<P>
	But while he averaged 11.3 points for the Cavs in the last two  
seasons, Anderson also missed 28 games with knee injuries. And by 
drafting shooting guard Trajan Langdon from Duke in June, 
Cleveland's backcourt was getting crowded. 
</P>
<P>
	The attraction for the Clippers was Anderson, an explosive  
leaper and finisher who played two years for Cleveland after being 
drafted out of Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	``Derek's a very athletic guy, an up-tempo type of player,''  
said Elgin Baylor, Clippers vice president of basketball 
operations. ``He has speed and quickness. He's an explosive player 
who gets to the basket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cavaliers general manager Jim Paxson said Anderson's contract  
status was one factor among several motivating the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray, 26, a free agent who also negotiated with San Antonio,  
had played his entire five-year career with the Clippers. Used 
primarily at small forward, he averaged 12.2 points last year after 
losing his starting job 13 games into the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson said it's hard to judge anyone based on last year's  
strike-shortened season. He sees Murray as someone who adds depth 
to the Cavaliers roster, which was riddled with injuries last 
season, and can keep defenses from collapsing on big men Zydrunas 
Ilgauskas and Shawn Kemp. 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson said only the agreement with Murray was a ``multiyear  
deal,'' although the Orange County Register reported it would be a 
seven-year, $25 million contract. Cleveland still wants to re-sign 
fre agent forward Cedric Henderson, which Paxson said is a club 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray said he's excited to play for Cleveland after five losing  
seasons as a Clipper. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was roller coaster ride throughout the five years I was  
there,'' he said. ``I never knew where I stood in terms of the 
organization. It was a difficult time for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old Newman has one year remaining on his contract.  
The 14-year veteran averaged 6.1 points in 50 games last season.

<HEADLINE> Penny to Suns Deal Looks Imminent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Looks like Penny Hardaway will be a member of the Phoenix Suns  
by the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orlando Magic moved closer Wednesday to sending Hardaway to  
the Suns in a sign-and-trade deal, although the team was expected 
to spend a few hours sorting out its options. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Clippers and Cleveland Cavaliers pulled off the  
day's only trade, a sign-and-trade deal that sent Lamond Murray to 
Cleveland for Derek Anderson and Johnny Newman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sacramento Kings stayed busy, signing Clippers free-agent  
point guard Darrick Martin and re-signing free agent forward 
Lawrence Funderburke. 
</P>
<P>
	All the teams that had made bids for Hardaway dropped out of the  
picture by Wednesday morning, leaving Phoenix's offer of Danny 
Manning, Pat Garrity and draft picks the only decent option on the 
table. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge decision for us, obviously,'' said general manager  
John Gabriel, who was spending nearly all his waking hours in his 
office, talking with team personnel and representatives for 
Hardaway. ``I was in here until midnight with the coach (Doc 
Rivers) trying to work this out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was talk that Orlando might, out of spite, throw a wrench  
into Hardaway's plans -- and Phoenix's -- by refusing to sign and 
trade him, thereby forcing Hardaway to sign with Chicago, the 
Clippers or Toronto if he wanted anything approaching the 
seven-year, $92 million deal he would get from Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Gabriel, however, said such a scenario would ``probably not''  
happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's told us he wants to be here. We've finalized the  
contract, and now we're waiting for Orlando to pull the trigger,'' 
Suns president Jerry Colangelo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a trade would send Orlando deep into a rebuilding mode,  
with three starters from last season gone via trades. The Magic 
will have three first-round picks in next year's draft -- their own, 
Denver's and Golden State's -- all of which could be lottery picks. 
The Magic also would be about $10 million under the salary cap 
entering the 2001-02 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere around the league:  
</P>
<P>
	--Indiana Pacers general manager Donnie Walsh told the  
Indianapolis News that the Boston Celtics had approached him 
offering Antoine Walker. The Pacers also were known to be pursuing 
a sign-and-trade deal with the Clippers for Lorenzen Wright. 
</P>
<P>
	--Miami was closer to signing free agent forward Otis Thorpe, who  
played for Washington last season. 
</P>
<P>
	--Terry Porter, who played for the Miami Heat last season, was  
reportedly close to signing with San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	--Miami was reportedly trying to find a third team with  
salary-cap space to facilitate a three-way trade that would bring 
Wizards free agent Mitch Richmond to the Heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Cavaliers general manager Jim Paxson said Anderson's contract  
status was one factor behind his trade to the Clippers. Anderson, 
entering the final year of his three-year rookie contract, was 
seeking a seven-year, $60 million extension from the Cavs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clippers general manager Elgin Baylor said his team would not  
immediately offer Anderson an extension. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to get to know Derek, see how he plays and how well he  
fits in. That's something we need to see, and then we can talk 
about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murray, who lost his starting job with the Clippers last season  
after 13 games, agreed to a seven-year, $25 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson said it's hard to judge anyone based on last year's  
strike-shortened season and he sees Murray as someone who adds 
depth to the roster and keep defenses from collapsing on Cleveland 
big men Zydrunas Ilgauskas and Shawn Kemp. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray said he's excited to play for Cleveland after five losing  
seasons as a Clipper. He averaged 12.2 points last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was roller coaster ride throughout the five years I was  
there,'' he said. ``I never knew where I stood in terms of the 
organization. It was a difficult time for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers have now lost free agents Murray, Martin and Rodney  
Rogers. They stand to lose a fourth, Wright, but were expected to 
pull off another sign-and-trade deal for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's narrowing down now, but there are still quite a few teams  
that have called with an interest in Lorenzen,'' Baylor said. 
``There isn't anything that has come up thus far that would be 
acceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyrone Nesby and Eric Piatkowski are the Clippers' other free  
agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Funderburke, 28, averaged 9.2 points and 4.6 rebounds over two  
seasons with the Kings. Last season, the 6-foot-9 forward shot a 
team-leading 55.9 percent from the field while averaging 8.9 points 
per game. 
</P>
<P>
	A five-year NBA veteran, Martin averaged 8.0 points and 3.9  
assists for the Clippers last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Darrick provides us with an experienced point guard who has  
started a number of games over his NBA career,'' Sacramento general 
manager Geoff Petrie said. ``Along with Jason Williams, Darrick 
solidifies our situation at point guard, which was a position this 
offseason we wanted to address.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings, who acquired Nick Anderson from Orlando on Tuesday,  
are expected to re-sign forward Corliss Williamson later this week.

<HEADLINE> Directors Still in Hitchcock Shadow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- On Aug. 13, make that Friday the 13th, Alfred  
Hitchcock would have turned 100 years old. His portly shadow has 
never loomed larger. 
</P>
<P>
	Janet Leigh in a shower. James Stewart spying on his neighbors.  
Cary Grant chased by a crop-duster. Kim Novak in the churchtower. 
Not only have the images stayed with moviegoers, they've haunted 
moviemakers. No director so dominates a genre as Hitchcock does the 
thriller, and to make one is to be influenced by him, like it or 
not. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hitchcock is like a grammar book,'' Brian De Palma once said,  
``and it's all there to be learned.'' Directors have used his 
plots, his actors, his composer (Bernard Herrmann), and, in the 
case of Gus Van Sant, virtually an entire film. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past four decades, admirers have inadvertently created  
a subgenre, neo-Hitchcock: Van Sant's shot by shot remake of 
``Psycho''; Francois Truffaut's ``The Bride Wore Black''; John 
Schlesinger's ``Pacific Heights''; De Palma's ``Dressed to Kill''; 
Claude Chabrol's ``La Femme Infidele''; Andrew Davis' ``A Perfect 
Murder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In my lunches with him, when the subject of imitations came  
up, he would shrug and smile and say, `Let's talk about something 
else,''' said Hitchcock biographer Donald Spoto. ``Hitchcock had no 
great respect for most contemporary movies. He was far too busy in 
producing his own art.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His own influences came from both art and life. Born in London,  
just a few years after the invention of movies, Hitchcock began 
watching them as a teen-ager and even kept up with the industry 
trade journals. Around the same time, he read detective fiction and 
thrillers, especially the works of Edgar Allan Poe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very likely it's because I was so taken with the Poe stories  
that I later made suspense stories,'' Hitchcock once observed. ``I 
don't want to seem immodest, but I can't help comparing what I've 
tried to put in my films with what Edgar Allan Poe put in his 
novels (sic); a completely unbelievable story told to the readers 
with such spellbinding logic that you get the impression that the 
same thing could happen to you tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1920, his gifts as a sketch artist led to a job designing  
title cards at the London studios of the American film company 
Famous Players-Lasky. Hitchcock soon met a promising young editor 
and continuity supervisor named Alma Reville, whom he eventually 
married. Although only occasionally credited, she became his most 
trusted collaborator, his ultimate compliment being, ``Alma liked 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He would find a story, bring it back, have her read it, and if  
she thought it made a picture, fine. If she said no, he wouldn't 
touch it,'' said their daughter, Patricia Hitchcock O'Connell, who 
appeared in ``Strangers on a Train'' and other movies by her 
father. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they first saw the print of `Psycho,' right before it  
came out, there were just a few people in the screening room and 
everybody was raving about it. And they asked my mother, `What do 
you think?' And she said, `You can't send it out. Janet (Leigh) 
swallows when she's supposed to be dead.' Nobody else had caught 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From silent films such as ``The Lodger'' and ``The Ring'' to  
talkies like ``The Man Who Knew Too Much'' and ``The 39 Steps,'' 
Hitchcock became an internationally known director. In the late 
1930s, producer David O. Selznick brought him to the United States 
where he went on to make some of his most influential films, 
including ``Rear Window,'' ``Vertigo'' and ``Psycho.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For years he was regarded, and spoke of himself, as a popular  
entertainer. But in the 1950s, Truffaut and other French critics 
developed what became known as the ``auteur'' theory, interpreting 
movies as the director's personal vision. Hitchcock, who died in 
1980, was listed among the world's greatest filmmakers, canonized 
by Truffaut as ``the man we love to be hated by.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the 1960s, imitators had emerged and others found themselves  
compared to Hitchcock -- whether they liked it or not. 

</P>
<P>
                        *''The Prize'' (1964)    	
</P>
<P>
	Ernest Lehman, screenplay writer for ``North by Northwest,''  
also wrote this blatant, entertaining imitation. Directed by Mark 
Robson and based on a novel by Irving Wallace, ``The Prize'' stars 
Paul Newman as an alcoholic American novelist in Stockholm, where 
he is to receive the Nobel Prize. When a fellow honoree (Edward G. 
Robinson) is kidnapped, Newman helps find him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was taking a serious novel, written by a very close friend  
of mine, and trying to make a movie of it. But I finally lapsed 
into feeling that I could make a Hitchcock-type movie out of it,'' 
said Lehman, who even lifted a couple of scenes out of ``North by 
Northwest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``So I found myself doing that, and, of course, it didn't have  
Hitchcock. ... It didn't have the importance to be really compared 
to a Hitchcock film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                   *''The Bride Wore Black'' (1968)    	
</P>
<P>
	No one did more for Hitchcock's reputation than Truffaut, who  
wrote worshipfully of him in the '50s and in the 1960s collaborated 
with his idol on an interview book, when Truffaut was at his peak 
as a filmmaker. Eventually, he attempted his own Hitchcock-like 
thrillers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Bride Wore Black'' is based on a novel by ``William  
Irish,'' pen name for Cornell Woolrich, on whose short story ``Rear 
Window'' was based. Jeanne Moreau stars as Julie Kohler, a widow 
whose husband is gunned down on their wedding day. Cool and 
determined, she sets out to kill the men responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	Truffaut includes a few clever touches -- one would-be victim is  
arrested just as Julie is prepared to bump him off -- but Moreau 
looks bored (even for Moreau) and the story feels contrived. What 
was personal for Hitchcock becomes impersonal here. Even Truffaut 
didn't care for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Deliberate Hitchcock twist: In the novel, we only learn at the  
end why the murders were committed. In the film, Truffaut tells us 
early on. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                    *''La Femme Infidele'' (1969)    	
</P>
<P>
	In the mid-'50s, then-journalist Truffaut was supposed to  
interview Hitchcock in Paris, only to slip and fall into a nearby 
pond, postponing their first meeting for years. With him was 
another admirer, Claude Chabrol, whose films led some to call him 
the ``French Hitchcock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Set in Paris, this intelligent thriller reworks the plot of  
``Dial M for Murder'': The wife of an affluent businessman is 
having an affair. The husband catches on, confronts his rival and 
kills him. The wife becomes the chief suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	With his subtle wit and appreciation of detail, Chabrol has been  
the most accomplished of the master's disciples. It's the small 
touches that make the film work: the physical resemblance between 
the husband and the lover; the civilized banter that precedes the 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
	One sequence is especially worthy: The husband stuffs the corpse  
into a bag and dumps it into the trunk of his car. On his way to 
the lake, where he is to dispose of the body, the car is 
rear-ended. Witnesses emerge. A cop comes to offer help. Only by 
luck does the evidence remain concealed. 
</P>
<P>
	When the husband finally makes it to the lake, the dented trunk  
won't open. He must part with the entire car, which, as in 
``Psycho,'' only reluctantly slips beneath the surface. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                        *''Charade'' (1963)    	
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Donen, director of ``Singing in the Rain'' and other  
classic musicals, has long denied any Hitchcock influence on this 
chic thriller. ``He doesn't own the genre, any more than someone 
who makes a musical was automatically influenced by `Seven Brides 
for Seven Brothers,''' Donen said, referring to another of his 
films. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Donen wasn't thinking of him, ``chic thriller'' is  
almost another way of saying ``Hitchcock movie.'' Set in Paris, 
``Charade'' stars Audrey Hepburn as a precocious socialite whose 
husband has been murdered. Cary Grant is the mysterious man who may 
or may not be helping her. 
</P>
<P>
	Unintentionally or not, ``Charade'' works off a common Hitchcock  
theme -- multiple identities -- and features a rooftop struggle that 
recalls the rooftop struggle in ``To Catch a Thief.'' To its 
credit, ``Charade'' is blessed with that film's catty humor. ``It 
is infuriating,'' a lunch companion complains to the stylish 
Hepburn, ``that your happiness does not turn to fat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                      *''Monsieur Hire'' (1989)    	
</P>
<P>
	The French, Lehman complains, took Hitchcock a little too  
seriously. And so this film does. But Patrice Leconte's variation 
on the ``Rear Window'' story still is a highly effective 
psychological study, suggesting a collaboration in heaven between 
Hitchcock, Dostoevsky and Buster Keaton. 
</P>
<P>
	Michel Blanc plays a middle-age bachelor, pale and unsmiling and  
suspected for murder. His evenings are spent spying on an 
attractive young neighbor, whose boyfriend is also in trouble with 
the law. When the neighbor catches M. Hire in the act, she stalks 
him, befriends him and eventually humiliates him. 
</P>
<P>
	More sentimental than Hitchcock, Leconte tries hard to make us  
feel sorry for the title character; he didn't need to. Blanc's 
performance, as good as you could ask for, does the job. Not since 
Keaton has an actor earned so much sympathy simply by the intensity 
with which he opens and closes his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Best Hitchcock image, like something out of ``Psycho'': Blanc  
staring from his window, methodically eating spoonfuls of boiled 
egg. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                      *''High Anxiety'' (1977)    	
</P>
<P>
	``My father loved Mel Brooks,'' Patricia Hitchcock O'Connell  
says. ``He loved anything that had a sense of humor because my 
father had such a good sense of humor. He liked `High Anxiety' much 
better than the serious imitators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In this bawdy parody of ``Spellbound,'' ``Vertigo'' and other  
Hitchcock movies, Brooks stars as a psychiatrist who takes over The 
Psycho-Neurotic Institute for the Very, Very Nervous, where he 
confronts a resentful would-be director (Harvey Korman) and that 
shriveled sadist Nurse Diesel (Cloris Leachman). 
</P>
<P>
	The film is uneven, like virtually every Brooks comedy, but  
Hitchcock fans will enjoy the references and there are some great 
lines you'll have to see in context to appreciate: ``What a 
dramatic airport!'' ``Those who are tardy do not get fruit cup!'' 
``That kid gets no tip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Best sequence: Brooks chased by a bevy of birds, who unload  
their tidings upon him like great dollops of cookie dough. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                     *''The Crying Game'' (1992)    	
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock was the master of suspense, not surprise. Had he made  
this much-publicized film, the ``secret'' would have been revealed 
the moment Jaye Davidson appeared on screen, with a close-up that 
brought you straight to the heart of the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	But in other ways, ``The Crying Game'' is worthy of the  
Hitchcock tradition of ``identity thrillers,'' in which no one is 
what they appear to be. In the film, Stephen Rea stars as an IRA 
member drawn into a world of espionage, trapped between his 
political ties and his feelings for a British soldier's 
``girlfriend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The story I came up with was a challenge, a very imposing  
challenge, and Hitchcock's the only director I can think of who's 
managed stories that do these 90-degree turns,'' writer-director 
Neil Jordan said during a press conference shortly before the 
film's release. 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged watching ``Psycho'' and ``Vertigo'' while  
working on ``The Crying Game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In every situation he finds himself ... he has to make  
decisions,'' Jordan said of Rea's character, offering what could as 
easily be a description of Stewart in ``Vertigo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted a character in confrontation with every aspect of  
himself. The story allows me to peel his character away to his 
barest essence.''

<HEADLINE>  MLS Boots Logan for NFL Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Seeking more fans and higher television ratings,  
Major League Soccer turned to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Garber, who has spent the last three years running the NFL's  
European league, was hired as MLS commissioner on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Logan, the only commissioner in the four years of the  
soccer league, was forced to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday I was an 'is,''' Logan said at the start of the news  
conference. ``Today I'm a 'was.' Tomorrow, I assure you, I'm going 
to be an 'is' again. There's no elegant way to say I was fired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His resignation was sought by Stuart Subotnick, the MLS board of  
governors chairman of the New York-New Jersey MetroStars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don brings expertise that Doug didn't have,'' said Subotnick,  
adding that the league must pay more attention to fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``A fan is no different than a customer,'' he said. ``If you  
want a successful business, you need to get the loyalty of the 
customer, in this case the fan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We started with a bang, it leveled off and we're creeping up  
again. That's OK if you want a middling business. We don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Subotnick repeatedly referred to Garber's experience in  
marketing and public relations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not done a good job promoting the players,'' he said.  
``That's part of what you're going to find Don doing over time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garber is not well versed in soccer, but Subotnick said that  
will not be a liability. He pointed to Garber's success at 
introducing American football into Europe.

<P>
	MLS attendance has only started to rebound after two straight  
years of decline, and is still well below the average crowd of 
17,406 it achieved in its first season. The league's TV ratings are 
flat, and have been that way since the beginning of the league's 
second year. 
</P>
<P>
	And some team officials have grumbled about Logan, particularly  
following his dismissal of deputy commissioner Sunil Gulati in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	Gulati has been a major figure in American soccer for more than  
a decade. He played a key role in the organizing committee of the 
1994 World Cup, the U.S. Soccer Federation and the formation of 
MLS. 
</P>
<P>
	Gulati remains a consultant with the league, but Subotnick said  
he would not join the new administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Logan acknowledged he no longer had the confidence of the board  
of governors. When he finished his remarks, he stepped down from 
the dais and left the room. Garber and Subotnick then spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at an OK level, but not where we want to be as far as  
fan participation,'' Subotnick said in introducing Garber. 
</P>
<P>
	Garber, 41, has spent the last 15 years as a senior marketing  
and management executive with the NFL. Since 1996, he has been 
senior vice president/managing director of NFL International. 
</P>
<P>
	He was responsible for managing all business of the NFL outside  
the United States, overseeing TV production and distribution, 
marketing and fan development activities, sponsorship sales and 
licensing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took a foreign sport and achieved success with it in an  
area of the world where they don't play the game or view it on a 
regular basis,'' Subotnick said. ``Don's experience will help MLS 
capitalize on the extraordinary opportunity to make its mark among 
American sports spectators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garber said he wants to establish a closer connection to those  
who play soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to translate the tens of millions who play the game  
into those who go and watch it on TV,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Rise on Debt News / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bonds rose sharply Wednesday, snapping a  
four-session losing streak, as investors shrugged off worries about 
inflation and interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 25/32  
point, or $7.81 1/4 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, a key 
influence on borrowing costs, fell to 6.09 percent from late 
Tuesday's 6.16 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The market, which has been weighed down by signs of inflationary  
pressure, ended its recent slump as the White House said it is 
exploring ways to buy back part of the $3.6 trillion national debt 
held by the public, something that has not occurred since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department released for public comment a proposal  
that would allow it to take competitive offers from bond holders on 
a voluntary basis to reduce the amount of debt. Officials said they 
hope to establish final rules for the procedure by January. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
rose 3/32 to 1/8 point, while intermediate-term Treasurys rose 5/32 
to 3/16 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Wednesday, yields on three-month Treasury bills  
fell to 4.75 percent while the discount fell to 4.63 percent, down 
0.07 percentage point from Tuesday's levels. Yields on six-month 
Treasurys fell to 4.97 percent as the discount fell to 4.78 
percent, down 0.03 percentage point. One-year yields fell to 5.07 
percent as the discount fell to 4.82 percent, down 0.07 percentage 
point from late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.87 1/2 percent from 4.93 3/4 percent on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 1/16 point to 117 1/4. The average yield 
to maturity rose to 5.60 percent from 5.59 percent on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Tennessee Man Claims Big Game Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Too excited to sleep after finding out he won the  
$116 million Big Game drawing, Randy Kerfoot rushed to Atlanta from 
his Tennessee home Wednesday to claim his prize. Then he called his 
boss and said, ``I'm out of here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kerfoot, 41, will be able to bank about $39 million after  
choosing the cash option on his Quik Pik ticket. His lump-sum 
winnings come to about $59 million, or $38.9 million after taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia Lottery Corp. officials said it was the largest payout  
to a single winner since the state lottery began in 1993. The Big 
Game is played in seven states: Massachusetts, Georgia, Illinois, 
Maryland, Michigan, Virginia and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerfoot, who lives in East Ridge, Tenn., worked as parts and  
service director for an Infiniti dealership in Chattanooga. He said 
he and his wife, Sandy, checked the numbers repeatedly after 
Tuesday night's drawing to make sure they had the winning ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took it a while to really sink in, and I don't think  
anybody took their eyes off that ticket all night,'' he told 
reporters during a news conference with Georgia Lottery President 
Rebecca Paul. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerfoot said he intends to begin enjoying life immediately now  
that he is a wealthy man. His wife will continue working for a 
Toyota dealership, but only until she trains someone to replace her 
as controller and office manager, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first major purchase for the couple may be two new cars. A  
new house also may be in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the winnings also will go to charity, including the  
Ronald McDonald House, they said. The Kerfoots met as teen-agers 
working at a McDonald's restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	They have two daughters, ages 18 and 16, and a granddaughter.

	U.S. May Buy Back Debt  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States, which for most of the  
century has struggled to borrow money for the burgeoning national 
debt, is now figuring out ways to buy back some of the $3.6 
trillion debt held by the public. The Treasury Department today 
issued proposals for the debt buyback and plans to finalize details 
by Jan. 1. Officials said any government purchases of debt would be 
conducted through a reverse auction. The government would announce 
the type of securities it was interested in buying and accept 
competitive bids from holders of those securities. 

</P>
<P>
	Tax Bill Pushed Despite Veto Threat  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican leaders plan to move the $792  
billion tax cut package through the House and Senate tomorrow 
despite President Clinton's repeated veto threats. The 10-year 
package would gradually cut 1 percentage point off each personal 
income tax rate. It also would provide relief from the so-called 
marriage penalty, cut the individual capital-gains tax rate and 
eventually eliminate the estate tax. Clinton says the tax cut would 
use up almost all of the projected non-Social Security surplus over 
the next decade, leaving almost nothing for needed government 
programs and paying down the national debt. 

</P>

	Drought Takes Its Toll  
</P>
<P>
	ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- The drought is devastating crops and  
ruining lawns from Virginia to New England. Parts of the worst-hit 
Middle Atlantic States are seeing the driest 12-month period ever 
recorded. Experts say it could take a tropical storm to reverse the 
conditions. Maryland became the first state to impose mandatory 
water-use restrictions backed by the threat of fines up to $1,000. 
All of West Virginia has been declared a drought disaster, and 
Virginia is seeking the same designation for some areas. Delaware, 
Pennsylvania and New Jersey either have declared drought 
emergencies or are in the process of doing so.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The big selloff in Internet stocks that began  
quietly during the spring is accelerating, decimating the 
phenomenal gains achieved this year by many high-profile online 
companies. Online stocks dragged down the technology-laden Nasdaq 
composite index for a fifth-straight day today, leaving it 11.3 
percent lower than the all-time high it reached July 16. The 
40-stock Dow Jones Internet Index has shed more than 40 percent of 
its value since its all-time high April 13.

	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- A study being released tomorrow predicts  
that corporations around the world will save up to $1.25 trillion -- 
close to France's entire gross domestic product -- doing business 
over the Internet by 2002. Those savings range from reducing the 
amount of people it takes to process a sales request to making it 
easier and less expensive to order office supplies online. The 
study was conducted by Giga Information Group.

Scotto, who stripped in clubs while earning her doctorate, said her 
noncredit how-to class in striptease at Mount Holyoke College was 
so popular last year that she will offer it again. Ms. Scotto shows 
students clips from movies featuring strippers, teaches them some 
basic bump-and-grind moves and supplies them with props, including 
feather boas, fans and high heels.

unable to work out a long-term contract extension with Anderson. 
Terms were not disclosed but The Orange County Register reported

Anderson, 25, was entering the final year of his contract and was

<HEADLINE> Umpires Charge Unfair Labor Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An angry umpires union filed an unfair labor  
practice charge against baseball, hoping to save the jobs of 
one-third of its members. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners in turn filed a grievance against the major league  
umpires Tuesday, saying their mass resignations violated their 
labor contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Many labor lawyers say the National Labor Relations Board is  
more likely to rule for the owners than the umpires. To the 
individual umpires about to lose their jobs, the legal maneuvers 
might be their final hope. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to work as hard as I can to save my job,'' said a  
visibly angry Bill Hohn, one of the 22 umpires notified last week 
that baseball accepted their resignations, which are effective 
Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires want the NLRB to issue a complaint against owners that  
the agency could use to seek an injunction in federal court to 
prevent baseball from getting rid of the 22. The board is expected 
to decide on the charge in 4-6 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the umpires contend the July 14 decision to submit  
their mass resignations was ``protected concerted action'' under 
federal labor law and did not violate the provision in their labor 
contract stating ``there shall be no strike nor other concerted 
work stoppage.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see how that could sit in the parameters within the  
National Labor Relations Act,'' said Stanford law professor William 
Gould, the NLRB's former chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	In baseball's first statement since the controversy began,  
commissioner Bud Selig, AL president Gene Budig and NL president 
Len Coleman said the charge had no merit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The leagues will vigorously contest each and every  
allegation,'' they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires held a news conference in a room at the Official  
All-Star Cafe filled with players' jerseys. A sign of their plight 
was the absence of any umpire memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not the guys out there charging $6 for a beer, charging  
$5 for a hot dog,'' said Ed Montague, one of the NL umpires who is 
keeping his job. ``We're not the guys who raised World Series 
tickets from $75 to $150. But we're the ones who get beat on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires, fearful that baseball would lock them out next year,  
hoped the mass resignations would force owners to negotiate an 
agreement to replace the one that expires Dec. 31. The move 
backfired when 13 umpires didn't quit and another 14 withdrew their 
resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball then hired 25 new umps from the minors, effective Sept.  
1, and accepted the resignations of the 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``This intent-to-resign strategy was posed as an alternative to  
give a 6 1/2-week cooling-off period for them so that we could 
negotiate,'' union head Richie Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires contend baseball then induced many of their colleagues  
to withdraw their resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was unlawful for the leagues to convert these into  
discharges,'' said Susan Davis, the umpires' new lawyer. ``It's 
illegal to punish people who stood up for their union and in a 
retaliatory manner pick and choose who you chip. They went one by 
one and picked them off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The umpires say Selig made ``unilateral changes in significant  
terms and conditions of their employment'' late last year, shifting 
authority over the umpires from the league presidents to the 
commissioner's office. The union also says it was illegal for 
owners to change the strike zone without their participation and 
say they feared owners would get rid of 20 umps. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sign of the split between AL and NL umps, six NL umps  
attended the news conference but just one from the AL, Drew Coble. 
Of the 27 umps who broke with the union by not quitting or 
withdrawing their resignations before July 25, 23 were from the AL. 
</P>
<P>
	Anger toward the AL umps and toward the replacements filled the  
room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel totally betrayed by the umpires who left the union,  
quit my family, put us in this position,'' said Hohn, an NL ump. 
</P>
<P>
	Montague's wife, Marcia, wrote an angry letter last week to  
Denise Hirschbeck, the wife of AL ump John Hirschbeck, who has been 
organizing umpires opposed to union head Richie Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife felt and wrote this from her heart,'' Montague said.  
``She did not write this with hatred toward Denise Hirschbeck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On another front, the president of the minor league umpires said  
they fired Phillips as their negotiator Monday before he quit, a 
charge Phillips denies. The minor leaguers were upset Phillips 
failed to ask the NLRB to hold an election to certify their union, 
and during a telephone poll Friday and Saturday they decided to 
seek another lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Richie Phillips that,'' International League ump Mike  
Billing said. ``He told me that was fine with him because he was 
resigning anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires supporting Phillips and those opposed are vying for the  
support of the 25 minor leaguers who become permanent major league 
umpires on Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want a head count in our league of the new guys they  
hired to see if they could count on knocking Richie out or not,'' 
Angel Hernandez said.

<HEADLINE> SEC Sues Texas Investment Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Federal regulators charge that a Texas investment  
firm defrauded investors of up to $475 million by making 
speculative investments and selling virtually worthless securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit Wednesday  
in federal court in San Antonio against InverWorld Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents from the FBI, the SEC and the IRS executed search  
warrants at the business offices of InverWorld and its chairman, 
Jose P. Zollino, in connection with a criminal investigation, an 
FBI spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC lawsuit and the search warrants are the latest  
developments in an emerging scandal surrounding InverWorld, which 
catered mostly to wealthy investors in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	In late June, InverWorld affiliates in Great Britain and the  
Cayman Islands told investors they were closing and freezing all 
accounts. Those affiliates are now in liquidation proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said InverWorld, Zollino, 51, company President George  
F. Fahey, 62, and three affiliated companies may have lost 
investors' money through risky, unauthorized investments. The 
lawsuit also charged that an affiliate company issued practically 
worthless securities to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	According to related court filings by InverWorld affiliates, the  
company had as many as 1,000 investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said InverWorld's clients were interested in low-risk  
investments outside Latin America, including money-market accounts 
and U.S. Treasuries, but that InverWorld put their money in risky 
investments in ``volatile emerging markets'' and with entities 
closely related to InverWorld. It said fraudulent statements 
concealed the nature of the investments from clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Allan Diamond, a Houston lawyer who said he is representing  
about 100 investors who put more than $100 million in InverWorld, 
said the SEC charges are similar to what clients have told him. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of questions of what else happened, given the  
size of the losses,'' Diamond said. ``Everyone believed they were 
investing money in safe investments that would have reasonable 
yields and they could rely on in their retirement. You had people 
putting their life savings in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lamont Jefferson, a Dallas lawyer for InverWorld's domestic  
companies, said the investments were all in accordance with 
contracts signed by the investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been bad investments in global markets. It's a  
risky business, and you can lose money in those markets,'' 
Jefferson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson said he didn't know how the money was lost, whether it  
was one bad investment or a series of smaller ones. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC is seeking a freeze of assets at the companies, civil  
penalties and a repayment of funds. It asked that a temporary 
receiver be appointed to oversee InverWorld. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials said some of the securities sold to investors  
were issued by IWG Services Ltd., an InverWorld affiliate in London 
that was essentially a mail drop -- it had no offices or employees. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the SEC, InverWorld, Zollino and Fahey used IWG and  
Cayman Islands-based IG Services Ltd. as ``shells'' to move money 
beyond the reach of investors and regulators. The SEC said $210 
million was transferred to Swiss and Bahamian bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the SEC, only $90 million in securities may remain.  
</P>
<P>
	Zollino was unavailable for comment. The phone went unanswered  
at InverWorld's headquarters Wednesday.

<HEADLINE>  MLS Boots Logan for NFL Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Seeking more fans and higher television ratings,  
Major League Soccer turned to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Garber, who has spent the last three years running the NFL's  
European league, was hired as MLS commissioner on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Logan, the only commissioner in the four years of the  
soccer league, was forced to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday I was an 'is,''' Logan said at the start of the news  
conference. ``Today I'm a 'was.' Tomorrow, I assure you, I'm going 
to be an 'is' again. There's no elegant way to say I was fired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His resignation was sought by Stuart Subotnick, the MLS board of  
governors chairman of the New York-New Jersey MetroStars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don brings expertise that Doug didn't have,'' said Subotnick,  
adding that the league must pay more attention to fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``A fan is no different than a customer,'' he said. ``If you  
want a successful business, you need to get the loyalty of the 
customer, in this case the fan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We started with a bang, it leveled off and we're creeping up  
again. That's OK if you want a middling business. We don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Subotnick repeatedly referred to Garber's experience in  
marketing and public relations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not done a good job promoting the players,'' he said.  
``That's part of what you're going to find Don doing over time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garber is not well versed in soccer, but Subotnick said that  
will not be a liability. He pointed to Garber's success at 
introducing American football into Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	MLS attendance has only started to rebound after two straight  
years of decline, and is still well below the average crowd of 
17,406 it achieved in its first season. The league's TV ratings are 
flat, and have been that way since the beginning of the league's 
second year. 
</P>
<P>
	And some team officials have grumbled about Logan, particularly  
following his dismissal of deputy commissioner Sunil Gulati in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	Gulati has been a major figure in American soccer for more than  
a decade. He played a key role in the organizing committee of the 
1994 World Cup, the U.S. Soccer Federation and the formation of 
MLS. 
</P>
<P>
	Gulati remains a consultant with the league, but Subotnick said  
he would not join the new administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Logan acknowledged he no longer had the confidence of the board  
of governors. When he finished his remarks, he stepped down from 
the dais and left the room. Garber and Subotnick then spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at an OK level, but not where we want to be as far as  
fan participation,'' Subotnick said in introducing Garber. 
</P>
<P>
	Garber, 41, has spent the last 15 years as a senior marketing  
and management executive with the NFL. Since 1996, he has been 
senior vice president/managing director of NFL International. 
</P>
<P>
	He was responsible for managing all business of the NFL outside  
the United States, overseeing TV production and distribution, 
marketing and fan development activities, sponsorship sales and 
licensing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took a foreign sport and achieved success with it in an  
area of the world where they don't play the game or view it on a 
regular basis,'' Subotnick said. ``Don's experience will help MLS 
capitalize on the extraordinary opportunity to make its mark among 
American sports spectators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garber said he wants to establish a closer connection to those  
who play soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to translate the tens of millions who play the game  
into those who go and watch it on TV,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Mourns Shooting Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Holding hands and wiping away tears, hundreds of  
relatives and friends of those killed in a day trader's shooting 
rampage gathered Wednesday near the site of the massacre to 
remember the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``The loss you've suffered is without measure,'' Mayor Bill  
Campbell told the crowd, packed into a church. ``Your sorrow beyond 
words. But know that you are not alone. Today we come together as 
one Atlanta -- beyond race, beyond borders, beyond religion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, just blocks away, Mark O. Barton killed nine people  
and injured 13 at two brokerage offices, then shot himself. Before 
the shootings, he bludgeoned his wife and two children to death. 
</P>
<P>
	The memorial service began with a moment of silence. It ended  
with the lighting of small, red candles-- one for each of the 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will struggle with you,'' said the Rev. Don Harp, pastor of  
the church. ``We will work at finding light where darkness has 
come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alyce Wenzel of Huntley, Ill., lost her only son, 30-year-old  
Scott Webb. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I've cried all I can cry. This was, of course, a  
tribute to Scotty and a way of being able to say it is true, it 
really did happen,'' she said. ``I'm looking at these pictures and 
I'm thinking Scotty's going to call me. He was everything a mother 
could want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a deadly month for Atlanta -- 23 people died in three  
violent episodes last month. Six members of a family were slain in 
their home July 12 and two Cobb County police officers were killed 
in a standoff with a gunman July 23. They were also were honored at 
the service. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Barton's victims, Fred Herder, 54, was released from  
Grady Memorial Hospital Wednesday but eight others remained 
hospitalized, including two in critical condition. Among them was 
Yuzef Liberzon, 39, who was shot twice in the head. 
</P>
<P>
	For Hugh Thomas, 35, who was working in a travel agency on the  
first floor of the building where the rampage began, the memorial 
service was a step toward closure. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will never go away completely because there will always be  
a scar,'' said Thomas, a father of two who was not injured. ``The 
lesson I learned from this was never leave home without kissing 
your children or telling your wife you love her. You may leave and 
never get to see them again.''

<HEADLINE> Pan Am High Jumper Stripped of Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Cuban high jump great Javier Sotomayor  
was stripped of his gold medal at the Pan American Games on 
Wednesday after testing positive for cocaine, the biggest drug 
scandal to hit track and field since Ben Johnson at the 1988 Seoul 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor, considered Cuba's most popular athlete, will be  
suspended for two years -- knocking him out of this month's world 
championships and the Sydney Olympics, said Primo Nebiolo, 
president of track and field's international federation. 
</P>
<P>
	It is up to the Cuban federation to suspend Sotomayor. But  
Nebiolo said that if the Cubans do not suspend Sotomayor for two 
years, the IAAF will. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am shocked. I cannot believe it. I am very surprised and  
upset, because I have great esteem for Sotomayor,'' Nebiolo said 
from a meet in Monaco. 
</P>
<P>
	IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said he expected the Cuban  
federation to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Although all sports have prescribed drug penalties, they are not  
always applied on recreational drugs that are not taken to enhance 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Vasquez Rana, president of the Pan American Sports  
Organization, said that in doping cases, his group does not 
differentiate a recreational drug such as cocaine from a 
performance-enhancing substance such as a steroid. 
</P>
<P>
	``To us, it is sanctioned as an infraction,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor is the third athlete, all gold medalists, and the  
second high jumper to test positive at these games. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Vezina, goalie for Canada's in-line roller hockey team,  
was caught using Nandrolone, costing the team its gold medal. Juana 
Rosario Arrendel, winner of the women's high jump and the only gold 
medalist from the Dominican Republic at the games so far, was 
stripped of her medal for using stanozolol. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Ray Martinez, a member of Mexico's baseball team,  
refused to take a drug test, which was tantamount to a positive 
test. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba's medical officials at the Pan Am Games scheduled a news  
conference for later Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Eduardo de Rose, medical chief for the Pan Am Games committee,  
said it makes no difference where the cocaine originated or why it 
was taken, even if it was in a medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the substance is found in urine, we do not question where  
it came from and the reason for taking it,'' de Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
	Satomayor's urine sample showed cocaine in the amount of 200  
parts per million, which would be consistent with a person who uses 
the drug, de Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the discovery of cocaine traces indicates the drug would  
have been taken four to five days before the test. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than that, we would not find it,'' he said. ``When we  
find traces of cocaine, ... it shows the ingestion was very 
recent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor was seen in Cuba on Tuesday night at a rally for the  
gold medal-winning baseball team and stood beside President Fidel 
Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Sotomayor became the first person to win four Pan Am  
track and field titles in the same event Friday when he cleared 
7-6 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor won the 1992 Olympic gold medal, the 1993 and 1997  
world outdoor championships, and the 1989, 1993, 1995 and 1999 
world indoor championships. 
</P>
<P>
	He was ranked No. 1 in the world in 1988-89, 1992-95 and  
1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a further embarrassment to Cuba's team at the Pan Am  
games. Eight Cubans have left the delegation, including one 
journalist, with authorities saying at least seven plan to defect. 
</P>
<P>
	The finding against Sotomayor marked the biggest scandal in  
track and field since Johnson was stripped of his 100-meter gold 
medal and world record in Seoul for using the performance-enhancing 
drug stanozolol. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson later returned to competition, but he again tested  
positive for drugs in 1993 and was suspended for life. He is 
appealing that second ban and has asked for reinstatement by the 
International Amateur Athletic Federation. The IAAF Council will 
meet at Seville, Spain, on Aug. 17 to decide the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor's case was the third involving big-name track athletes  
in the past two days. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Dennis Mitchell, the U.S. 100-meter champion and  
1992 Olympic bronze medalist, was banned for two years by the IAAF 
after a drug test showed high levels of testosterone. Earlier 
Wednesday, Britain's Linford Christie, 1992 Olympic 100-meter gold 
medalist, was suspended by the IAAF after a drug test showed the 
possible presence of Nandrolone. Christie insisted he was innocent 
and intends to defend himself against the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor assured his place in sports history by soaring 8 feet  
at the Central American Championships at San Juan, Puerto Rico, on 
July 29, 1989. He improved that record to 8-0 1/2 at Salamanca, Spain, 
on July 27, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	He set the world indoor record of 7-11 1/2 on March 4, 1989. He has  
cleared 7-8 1/2 a record 88 times and 7-10 1/2 a record 21 times.

<HEADLINE> Sprinter Mitchell Gets Two-Year Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Sprinter Dennis Mitchell, banned from track events for a  
two-year period, will be be eligible to run in the 2000 Sydney 
Olympics because the penalty is retroactive. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell was declared ineligible from April 1, 1998, until March  
31, 2000. Any performances by him during that period are ``null and 
void,'' international track's governing body said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The retroactive ban ends six months before the Sydney Olympics.  
However, Mitchell, the U.S. 100-meter champion, will miss the world 
championships this month in Seville, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Amateur Athletic Federation said his drug test  
from 16 months ago showed high levels of testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF arbitration panel ruled that Mitchell, the 100-meter  
bronze medalist in the 1992 Olympics and two-time bronze medalist 
at the world championships, had no right of appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision is final and binding,'' Giorgio Reineri, a  
spokesman for the IAAF said from the organization's headquarters in 
Monte Carlo, Monaco. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell's lawyer maintained on Tuesday the 33-year-old sprinter  
has never taken testosterone or any other banned substance. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has always been against the use of drugs in track and  
field,'' lawyer Suja Thomas said from New York. ``This is truly a 
severe disappointment to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about Dennis Mitchell and he is an exemplary person,  
and secondarily he is an athlete,'' Thomas said. ``He doesn't want 
this perception and he wants to compete. He should compete because 
he hasn't done anything wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A call to Mitchell in Florida was answered by his wife, who said  
he was not home. Mitchell ran Monday in Malmo, Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	Reineri said he did not consider the ban a light punishment.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is the rule for everybody,'' he said. ``According to our  
constitution, a ban starts the day after the positive doping 
test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A three-member panel of USA Track and Field cleared Mitchell in  
December. The USATF did not release the details of Mitchell's 
defense or the reasons for exonerating him. 
</P>
<P>
	But London's Daily Telegraph reported this year that Mitchell  
won his case on grounds that his positive result stemmed from 
having sex four times and drinking five bottles of beer the night 
before the test. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF arbitrators met July 24-25. The organization said the  
USATF decision in December was ``erroneous.'' Messages left at USA 
Track and Field in Indianapolis were not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas disputed the report that sex and beer contributed to the  
positive drug test. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's much more complicated than that,'' she said, adding that  
a combination of stress and nonbanned substances caused him to fail 
the test that day. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what this case is all about,'' she said. ``It's very  
unfortunate it has come to this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Mitchell ran the 100 in 10.09 seconds in Malmo. He  
led fellow American Maurice Greene for the first 50 meters before 
finishing second to the world record-holder. 
</P>
<P>
	His best time this season is 10.02, with three other Americans  
having run faster.

<HEADLINE> Something for All in Tax Cut Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republicans' $792 billion tax cut proposal  
offers something for nearly everyone, but the biggest breaks would 
not happen until well into the next century, officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the big-ticket item in the 10-year package would  
trim all income tax rates by 1 percentage point: first, the bottom 
15 percent rate would drop to 14 percent by 2003, followed by all 
the others in 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, repeal of the estate tax would take place in small  
increments beginning in 2003, with the full impact delayed until 
2009. Relief from the ``marriage penalty'' that hits many 
two-income couples would phase in between 2001 and 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the tax cut for 2000 would total only $5.2 billion and  
only $156.2 billion over its first five years, said Lindy Paull, 
staff director for the Joint Committee on Taxation, which makes 
official tax estimates for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The package's tax cuts are phased in because the non-Social  
Security surplus -- which the GOP would use to finance the tax 
reductions -- is projected to grow from almost nothing next year to 
$178 billion in 2009. 
</P>
<P>
	That did not stop Republicans from touting the bill Wednesday as  
an ideal way eventually to return surplus dollars to hard-pressed 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This tax relief bill will help individuals and families at all  
income levels met real needs,'' said Sen. William Roth, R-Del., 
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The House planned to vote on the bill Thursday, followed by the  
Senate by Friday at the latest. President Clinton, once again 
pledging a veto, said the GOP package is ``risky and plainly 
wrong'' because it jeopardizes Social Security and Medicare, 
national debt reduction and spending for key programs such as 
defense and education. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Clinton has said he would sign a modest tax cut of  
perhaps $300 billion, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said in an 
interview that he sees no signs of compromise with the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see any indication that he's serious at all,'' said  
Lott, R-Miss. ``I'm hopeful, because I want it very badly. But the 
president has shown no inclination to engage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite this partisan gridlock, Republicans made sure their tax  
bill was chock full of items sure to please their many 
constituencies, ranging from pro-family conservative groups to 
international and domestic business. 
</P>
<P>
	The Family Research Council, for example, joined GOP lawmakers  
at a Capitol Hill news conference to hail the marriage penalty 
provisions, which have been beefed up from an original House 
measure that caused some grumbling among conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``These members worked to stop the marriage tax,'' said Janet  
Parshall, spokeswoman for the group. ``They stood up to protect 
marriage when many were not listening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill contains tax breaks for education, long-term health  
care and health insurance premiums, repeals the alternative minumim 
tax for individuals and cuts top capital gains tax rates for most 
taxpayers from 20 percent to 18 percent retroactive to Jan. 1, 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	It also has some special targets: a repeal of a 10 percent  
excise tax on certain kinds of fishing tackle boxes; an increase in 
tax breaks for reforestation expenses incurred by timber companies; 
breaks for purchasers of nuclear plants aimed at the costs of 
cleaning up reactor sites; and a credit for electricity produced 
from poultry waste. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would extend the research and development tax  
credit sought by high-tech businesses by five years, instead of the 
permanent extension they want. That brought a retort from 
Democrats, who are competing fiercely for support from those same 
companies and sought a permanent extension in their tax plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We listened and we delivered in our plan,'' said Sen. Harry  
Reid, D-Nev. ``The Republicans have done nothing more than talk.''

<HEADLINE> Editorial Roundup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the  
United States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	July 29  
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle Times, on unspent welfare money:  
</P>
<P>
	Robbing from the poor to give to the rich. It's not what Robin  
Hood would have done, but it's a predictable tactic from 
Republicans in Congress desperate to deliver tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	House GOP leaders are expected to ask the nation's governors to  
give back up to $6 billion in unspent federal welfare money. Every 
governor ... should ignore such requests. The success of national 
welfare reform hinges upon a promise made in 1996 by Congress not 
to touch that money. 
</P>
<P>
	The states' success in managing the federal money -- far better  
than the feds ever did -- does not give Congress the right to break 
its promise. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Congress agreed to pay states a fixed amount every year  
until 2002. The states could use that money how they wished to 
reduce caseloads. Since then, caseloads have dropped nearly 40 
percent. The number of welfare recipients has rolled back to 1969 
levels -- a significant achievement. ... 

</P>
<P>
	The Orlando (Fla.) Sentinel, on the FBI:  
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Bureau of Investigation owes Americans an  
explanation regarding the agency's handling of the murders in 
Yosemite National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Until last week the FBI officials assured the public that they  
knew who killed three women who were visiting Yosemite National 
Park in February. ... 
</P>
<P>
	That put the public at ease, knowing that law-enforcement  
officials believed the killers were behind bars on unrelated 
charges. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Within a few days, agents tracked down Cary Stayner, a handyman  
who worked in the park, and arrested him for Joie Ruth Armstrong's 
slaying. During questioning, he admitted to killing Ms. Armstrong 
and also said that he, alone, had slain the three women visitors in 
February. ... 
</P>
<P>
	How did federal investigators get so far off track? And how  
often does the FBI make such misjudgments? ... 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the agents involved in the Yosemite case said that they  
feel badly about what has occurred. And the agency officials said 
they are reviewing the handling of the case. That's a good first 
step, but it's not enough. 
</P>
<P>
	The public deserves answers from the FBI. After Mr. Stayner's  
case has been resolved in court, the FBI should open the case file 
to public scrutiny so it can be determined what went wrong. ... 

</P>
<P>
	July 29  
</P>
<P>
	Clovis (N.M.) News Journal, on the consequences of world  
policing: 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen Serbian farmers killed recently by automatic gunfire  
while harvesting hay in the Kosovan village of Gracko, within 
earshot of British ``peacekeeping'' troops, can be viewed as late 
casualties of the NATO war against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO officials say they have no suspects in what they described  
as an organized assault against the Serbian villagers and 
acknowledged that NATO is virtually powerless to stop the 
continuing onslaught of ethnic violence. ...

	While the killing in Gracko received a fair amount of news  
coverage, however, other deaths -- what might be called the casual 
casualties of the imperial impulse that is almost second nature to 
U.S. government officials -- have received very little attention. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States continues to bomb Iraq. A few days ago, the  
Iraqi government claimed that 14 civilians were killed and 25 
others wounded in an air strike in Abu Sukhayr, 125 miles south of 
Baghdad. Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon disputed the Iraqi claim 
that those killed were civilians, saying ``We did not attack a 
civilian target. We attacked a military installation.'' But nobody 
denies that the Untied States continues to bomb Iraq -- enforcing a 
``no-fly'' zone arbitrarily imposed on the country after a war the 
United States thought it had won years ago. ... 
</P>
<P>
	And there is news that five U.S. military personnel and two  
Colombian air force officers were almost certainly killed when a de 
Havilland RC-7 plane went missing in bad weather in mountainous 
terrain. The plane was on a routine anti-narcotics mission, part of 
the U.S. government's relentless effort to internationalize the 
Drug War. ...

	The Times-Picayune, New Orleans, on cruises and crime:  
</P>
<P>
	It took a judge's order in an alleged rape victim's lawsuit to  
force the nation's largest cruise company, Carnival Cruise Lines, 
to reveal how many sexual assault incidents it had investigated on 
its ships. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, crime can happen anywhere. ... But victims on ships, in  
some cases, didn't get the same attention from law enforcement 
authorities as victims on dry land because of cruise company 
policy, and that's not acceptable. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately, the industry is changing its ways. ...  
</P>
<P>
	The International Council of Cruise Lines, which covers 90  
percent of the American cruise industry, has set up a uniform 
standard that requires all alleged crimes to be reported 
automatically to the FBI for any vessel that calls on U.S. ports or 
for any incident involving a U.S. citizen. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Industry officials assert that their ships are ... safer than  
small towns in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	That may be true, but in the past, cruise companies seemed too  
concerned with merely looking safe. It's much better ... to make 
passenger safety the top priority.

	Chico (Calif.) Enterprise-Record, on Hillary Clinton interview:  
</P>
<P>
	The late comedian Flip Wilson used to get laughs on his 1970s TV  
show by explaining away his mischief with the line ``the devil made 
me do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now comes Hillary Clinton, the first lady of the United States,  
with an even more uproarious line in explaining her husband's 
sexual escapades, including that with a White House subordinate 
young enough to be his daughter that led to his impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	What made Clinton do it, says his betrayed wife, was an  
emotional tug-of-war the president had at an early age between his 
mother and grandmother. ... 
</P>
<P>
	As Mrs. Clinton tells it, he has remained a victim of this  
trauma in adulthood and has therefore been personally unaccountable 
because he has helplessly tried to please all women with his 
philandering. 
</P>
<P>
	However, says Mrs. Clinton, dutifully confessing her love and  
understanding, he has bravely if futilely attempted to escape this 
hold on his behavior. And besides, she says, he is such a wonderful 
leader! ... 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, not surprisingly, clearly gave her interview to a  
magazine that she considers sympathetic to her, seeing as how it is 
owned in part by a corporation whose head is raising money for her 
in her effort to be a U.S. senator from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Was this interview, then, politically calculated? Of course it  
was, everything the Clintons do is calculated for political 
advantage. ... Of course, if the consensus comes up negative, Mrs. 
Clinton can just excuse it all away by explaining that a childhood 
episode involving her own grandmother made her do it.

	Star Tribune of Minneapolis, on Kathleen Soliah:  
</P>
<P>
	Despite their mustiness, the criminal charges against Kathleen  
Soliah remain capable of stirring great passions. People disagree 
wildly and persistently about whether she should go to prison, be 
placed on probation or perhaps sent on her way with a movie 
contract and a good-neighbor award. 
</P>
<P>
	These long leaps to judgment have one common factor -- an  
assumption that the facts necessary to decide Soliah's fate are 
already known. Some would lock her up on the basis of a 23-year-old 
indictment (not a conviction, mind you), and pay no attention to 
what she has done with her life since then. Some would set her free 
because she's been such a great mom and community asset, and forget 
about what she might have done all those years ago. Why waste time 
on something as cumbersome as a trial? 
</P>
<P>
	The problem with such reasoning ought to be obvious, as it  
surely would be with a more ordinary case, or a more typical 
defendant. Justice can be punitive or it can be merciful, but it 
must first be just. This requires a certain respect for the truth, 
and in turn a careful effort to find out the facts and weigh them 
in relation to one another. Both sides need to back off and let 
this process take its course. ...

	The Blade, Toledo, Ohio, on Woodstock:  
</P>
<P>
	You can't go back to the garden. Not if the garden is Woodstock.  
Instead of a love-in, this year's 30th anniversary of the historic 
1969 festival ended with looting and violence. 
</P>
<P>
	About 225,000 people attended the event, which had little in  
common with the original other than the name. 
</P>
<P>
	This time around it was neither stardust nor golden. The  
concert-goers were reportedly searched at the gates to ensure they 
were bringing in no food or drink. And the musical acts reflected 
the times: Fewer songs of peace and love, more songs of alienation 
and angst. Some of the bands that performed even egged on the 
rowdiest of the fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend was simply an excuse to party at a long rock  
concert. No one will remember the performances 30 years from now, 
not in the way that today we recall such epochal musical moments as 
Jimi Hendrix reinventing the national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
	Observers at this year's fest say conditions were squalid and  
the food and drink were overpriced. But poor conditions don't 
excuse rioting. They don't excuse violence. 
</P>
<P>
	If there is going to be another festival next year, fine. Just  
don't call it Woodstock. That's an insult to the name.

	Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo, on China's missile testing:  
</P>
<P>
	China's Foreign Ministry explained that the launching was  
conducted to test development of defensive capabilities to protect 
China's sovereignty and territory. But the terms `sovereignty' and 
`territorial integrity' are invariably used to rationalize arms 
buildups. North Korea, too, argues that its missile development is 
a matter of sovereignty. We are concerned that China's latest 
missile test will be seen by North Korea as justification for the 
development and launch of its own missile. 
</P>
<P>
	China has increased its defense spending for the past several  
years. It plans to stage its first large-scale military parade in 
15 years this autumn to mark the 50th anniversary of the foundation 
of the People's Republic of China. Apparently the government is 
intent upon lifting national military prestige. 
</P>
<P>
	It is up to China to decide whether to follow an arms race  
course. If China chooses the path of military buildup, however, it 
would surely increase tension in the region and affect 
international stability. The United States and China should avoid 
the folly of continuing the arms race as conducted by the United 
States and the Soviet Union from the 1950s, into the 21st century.

	Details of Hillary Rodham Clinton's private life, given her

public scrutiny, not only because of the possible political 
spin-offs in the Bill Clinton-Hillary Rodham Clinton-Monica 
Lewinsky soap-opera, but also because of the influence these 
revelations may have on global public opinion and morality. 
</P>
<P>
	After her interview to Talk magazine, we are wondering why she  
did it: typically female appeasement, conjugal pragmatism, or an 
attempt to get a sympathy vote from both men and women? ... 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, the controversial author Elizabeth Wurtzel described  
Mrs. Clinton as a terrible example of the ``masochist woman,'' 
eagerly sacrificing herself in order to favor her husband's

<P>
	Le Figaro, Paris, on Albanian-Serb reconciliation in Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Kouchner (the U.N. special representative who is  
Kosovo's top civilian official) is right to stress that the 
reconciliation between the Albanian and Serb population in Kosovo 
`will take time.' He is discovering the depth of hatred separating 
the two communities, a hatred that 70 days of NATO bombardments 
could in no way heal. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Albanians, it is now the turn of Kosovo's Serbs to be  
the main victims of intolerance. Last week's assassination of 14 
Serbian farmers close to the village of Gracko was by no means an 
isolated incident. 
</P>
<P>
	At the head of the U.N.-run temporary government in Kosovo,  
Kouchner is powerless. The 35,000 soldiers deployed by NATO since 
its victory against Milosevic are not enough to contain the 
violence which, according to KFOR, has so far led to about 30 
deaths a week, mostly Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of congratulating themselves at grand symbolic reunions  
such as the one in Sarajevo, Allied leaders should develop means 
for their objectives. For example, they should send promised police 
forces to Kosovo without further delay.

	The Times, London, on staffing the British Army:  
</P>
<P>
	If George Robertson is confirmed as the next NATO  
secretary-general, one problem will outrank all others in the 
in-tray marked ``most urgent'' that will await his successor. That 
is the Army's shortage of trained fighting manpower, which is now 
so acute that there is a serious mismatch between Britain's 
strategic policy choices and the capacity to implement them. Kosovo 
offers a high-profile example of this worsening dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
	... The disturbing truth is that the Army simply does not have  
enough soldiers. Nearly 50 percent of the Army is now on 
operational duty, and even when this is reduced to 28 percent by 
next year, the government's target of 24-month gaps between tours 
will still be beyond reach. The Army is more overstretched than at 
any time since the late 1940s. And the longer this continues, the 
harder it will be to recruit and retain career soldiers.

	Financial Times, London, on U.S. government surplus:  
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of an era of fiscal surpluses in the U.S., after  
almost 20 years of deficits, has left the Republican party 
leadership quite dizzy. Big tax cuts based on the promise of budget 
surpluses amount to bad economics. It may also be bad politics. 
</P>
<P>
	... The House and Senate Republican tax-cut plans differ in  
detail. But the core idea is the same: setting in place tax cuts 
now to give $800 billion of this notional surplus back over the 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	... The Republicans are desperate for big tax cuts. They appear  
to have got the politics wrong. Core Republican voters may want tax 
cuts. But opinion polls show no great appetite among the wider 
electorate. A stalemate with the White House looms. The Democrats 
must relish the fight.

with a promise to bring peace to the country. 
</P>
<P>
	His highly publicized meeting with Manuel Marulanda, the leader  
of the FARC rebels, showed the nation even before his election that 
he was ready to sit at the table with the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	It was clear to Pastrana that he didn't face a walk in the park,  
rather a long and tiring march. 
</P>
<P>
	But Colombia, tired of almost 40 years of civil strife, took the  
glimmer of hope as a new dawn heralding peace, justice without 
corruption and true democracy.

the horizon have developed into storm clouds. ...

<HEADLINE> Drought Forces Water Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Maryland's governor banned lawn watering  
and home car washing Wednesday to help conserve the state's water 
supply, which is shrinking in the drought devastating the East. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's 5 million residents could face fines of up to $1,000  
if they don't heed the water restrictions, the first statewide 
mandatory measures in the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	``We urge everyone to work with us,'' Gov. Parris Glendening  
said. ``This is a time to pull together and head off what could be 
a serious crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The restrictions also ban hosing down streets or sidewalks,  
running ornamental fountains and filling or topping off private 
swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardens may be watered, but only with watering cans or handheld  
hose. Commercial car washing is allowed only in facilities where at 
least 80 percent of the water is recycled. 
</P>
<P>
	And restaurants aren't supposed to serve water unless customers  
specifically ask for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses were asked to voluntarily reduce water use by 10  
percent, and golf courses must reduce water usage by 80 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in the Northeast, Delaware, Pennsylvania and New  
Jersey either have declared drought emergencies or are in the 
process of doing so. All of West Virginia has been declared a 
drought disaster and Virginia is seeking the same designation for 
parts of that state. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania's governor imposed mandatory restrictions in 55 of  
the state's counties, but compliance remains voluntary in the 
remaining 12. Farther west, Ohio Gov. Bob Taft has asked people in 
the eastern part of his state to voluntarily limit water usage. 
</P>
<P>
	Rainfall in the Baltimore area for the 12-month period ending  
July 31 was more than a foot and a half below normal. The city's 
reservoirs only hold a 35- to 60-day supply of water. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they need some kind of relief, it's going almost take a  
tropical storm,'' said James Newkirk of the National Weather 
Service.

<HEADLINE> Dow Chemical To Buy Union Carbide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Dow Chemical Co. is buying Union Carbide  
Corp. for $9.3 billion in stock and $2.3 billion in assumed debt, 
creating the world's second-largest chemical company behind DuPont. 
</P>
<P>
	The merged company, which will operate under the Dow Chemical  
name, will have $24 billion in annual revenues. About 2,000 jobs 
will be cut as a result of the merger, leaving about 49,000 
employees. The two companies expect the combination to save $500 
million in annual costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This transaction is a giant step in our strategy to transform  
Dow into the world's most productive, best 'value-growth' company 
in the chemical industry,'' said William S. Stavropoulos, president 
and chief executive officer of Dow Chemical. 
</P>
<P>
	Union Carbide shareholders will own about 25 percent of Dow  
Chemical after the deal is complete, and Union Carbide Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer William Joyce will become vice chairman of 
the Dow Chemical board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Union Carbide shareholders will receive 0.537  
shares of Dow Chemical for each of their Union Carbide shares -- or 
$66.96 based on Tuesday's closing price of Dow Chemical's stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger depends on the approval of Union Carbide shareholders  
and regulatory authorities. The companies expect the deal to be 
completed by the first quarter of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the right move at a good time,'' Joyce said in a  
statement. ``In a consolidating chemical industry where fewer, more 
powerful companies will exist, the combination of Dow and Union 
Carbide now sets the gold standard for the industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Chemical, based in Midland, is the second-largest U.S.  
chemical company behind DuPont, and is a leading maker of plastics, 
chemicals, hydrocarbons, and herbicides and pesticides. It earned 
$1.3 billion on revenues of $18.4 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Union Carbide, based in Danbury, Conn., produces basic and  
specialty chemicals. It had profits of $403 million in 1998 on 
sales of $5.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal will be completed under the ``pooling-of-interests''  
accounting method, popular in U.S. mergers, allowing the companies 
to avoid a large tax bill that would have been generated if the 
deal was an outright purchase of one company by the other.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Mourns Shooting Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- An investor's killing spree that took 13 lives,  
including his own, taught Atlanta a lesson about the power of 
unity, Mayor Bill Campbell told mourners at a citywide memorial 
service today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we come together as one Atlanta -- beyond race, beyond  
borders, beyond religion,'' he told the crowd that nearly filled 
the 1,125-seat Peachtree Road United Methodist Church. 
</P>
<P>
	Religious leaders from different faiths remembered the victims  
and offered words of encouragement during the service, held just 
blocks from where Mark O. Barton killed nine of his victims at two 
brokerage offices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ernest Hemingway wrote, 'Life breaks us all and for many we  
become strong at the broken places,''' said the Rev. Don Harp, 
pastor of the church. ``We have gathered as a community to express 
that we are at one of those broken places. We gather to reaffirm 
our understanding of life and, unfortunately, death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harp also read a letter from President Clinton extending his  
sympathy to the victims' families and the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Candles were lit at the front of the church for each of the nine  
shooting victims and for Barton's wife, Leigh Ann, and children, 
11-year-old Matthew and 8-year-old Mychelle, who were bludgeoned to 
death in the days before the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton killed himself hours after his rampage when police  
cornered him about 30 miles northwest of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Also honored with candles today were six members of an Atlanta  
family slain in their home July 12 and two Cobb County police 
officers killed in a standoff with a gunman July 23. 
</P>
<P>
	The last of Barton's victims were buried Tuesday. About 300  
mourners gathered at River of Life Family Church to eulogize Joe 
Dessert, 60, a former real estate broker who, like Barton, had 
taken up the risky investment method known as day trading.

<HEADLINE> Abu-Jamal Backers Point To Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Supporters of death row inmate Mumia  
Abu-Jamal say a letter written by a former prison volunteer proves 
he lied when he said Abu-Jamal admitted murdering a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	On a live morning broadcast on WHAT radio Tuesday, Abu-Jamal's  
supporters handed Philip Bloch's attorney the letter they say Bloch 
wrote the inmate at least seven months after the alleged 
confession. 
</P>
<P>
	``So -- it is possible to get justice from a jury -- not always --  
but sometimes. So, when you get a new trial -- I think that there is 
a good chance of acquittal,'' Bloch wrote in the July 17, 1993, 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal's attorney, Leonard Weinglass, said the letter  
directly contradicts Bloch's allegation that Abu-Jamal had 
confessed to him a few months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``This contradicts in writing from the author's own hand,''  
Weinglass said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloch, however, says he is no liar. He explained that it took  
time for Abu-Jamal's comment to sink in. 
</P>
<P>
	``My feeling toward Mumia didn't change overnight. It changed  
very gradually,'' Bloch said in a telephone interview from his York 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview published in the August issue of Vanity Fair,  
Bloch came forward to say Abu-Jamal, a onetime Black Panther and 
radio reporter whose case has attracted widespread attention, 
admitted he murdered officer Daniel Faulkner in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloch, a 47-year-old substitute teacher and former Pennsylvania  
Prison Society volunteer, told the magazine he had asked Abu-Jamal 
nearly seven years ago if he had any regrets about killing 
Faulkner. Abu-Jamal said ``Yes,'' Bloch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloch said he came forward out of sympathy for Faulkner's widow.  
</P>
<P>
	Weinglass, however, accused Bloch of coming forward because  
prosecutors needed new evidence to use in Abu-Jamal's appeal for a 
new trial. He said Abu-Jamal searched his personal letters and 
found Bloch's among them. The Philadelphia Tribune first reported 
Bloch's letter on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recorded radio broadcast last week, Abu-Jamal called Bloch  
a liar. The recording was played on the air again Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why write to a guy and write about a new trial or acquittal if  
that guy confessed his guilt to you? The answer is simple. There 
was no confession. Period,'' Abu-Jamal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he does not remember writing the letter, Bloch said he  
imagines that during that time he believed Abu-Jamal shouldn't have 
been on death row. If the shooting was a crime of passion, at the 
time, ``I still did not want to see him in jail for life or get 
executed for it,'' Bloch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal's appeal is pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.  
Weinglass said he expects the high court to reject the case in 
October and remand it to the federal district court in Philadelphia 
for further consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal is seeking a new trial on the grounds that the  
prosecution withheld evidence, the judge was biased, black jurors 
were kept off the jury, witnesses were influenced and his original 
defense was inadequate. Death penalty opponents have since rallied 
around Abu-Jamal and made him a worldwide symbol of their cause. 
</P>
<P>
	Police officers, government officials and others have recently  
rallied around Maureen Faulkner, the widow of the slain officer, to 
accuse Abu-Jamal supporters of ignoring the facts of the case and 
spreading misinformation in their efforts on his behalf.

<HEADLINE> Exec: Auto Biz Needs New Talent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) -- The auto industry needs an image  
makeover if it's going to fill its worldwide shortage of highly 
skilled workers and executives, a top Ford Motor Co. executive 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our industry is on the brink of a potentially devastating  
shortage of talent -- on the plant floors, in our salaried ranks and 
at our dealerships,'' said Ford Vice Chairman Peter J. Pestillo. 
``At every level, in all job categories, we need more good people 
and we need them today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pestillo told an industry conference that among educators,  
students and the general public ``the perception is that auto 
manufacturing is a second-class industry, that it takes place in 
dark, dirty environments, that our workforce is uneducated and 
unskilled. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to do a better job of informing the outside world that  
our industry offers opportunities for forward-thinkers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pestillo said the problem is affecting suppliers and dealers as  
well. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited a recent University of Michigan study that found 85  
percent of automotive suppliers reported they had been affected by 
the tight labor market, with the most critical need in the skilled 
trades. 
</P>
<P>
	He criticized the nation's school system for failing to produce  
high school graduates with the entrepreneurial skills the industry 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's workplaces need people who are flexible and adaptable,  
who have an intuitive ability to solve problems and work in teams, 
who are independent, creative thinkers and can communicate 
effectively,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when schools do produce that kind of graduate, top students  
often don't want to work in manufacturing, Pestillo said. They're 
more likely to be lured into higher-profile, high-tech industries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The auto industry has an image problem among so-called  
high-tech people,'' he said. ``They don't think of us as a 
technology industry, but we are. The auto industry is one of the 
greatest consumers and producers of new technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He urged industry leaders to get more involved in all levels of  
the education system, by taking part in curriculum planning and 
helping to set policy on local school boards. 
</P>
<P>
	Pestillo said Ford was working with 76 high schools in the  
United States, Canada and South Africa to educate students about 
manufacturing careers. 
</P>
<P>
	Other car companies are taking similar steps. DaimlerChrysler AG  
is working with high schools and the community college system in 
Oakland County, near Detroit, to promote manufacturing careers. 
</P>
<P>
	The labor shortage is especially critical in the car-repair  
business. The U.S. Labor Department estimates there's a shortfall 
of about 60,000 trained mechanics nationwide. Only two people enter 
the field for every 10 that leave. 
</P>
<P>
	To remedy the situation, automakers have instituted programs to  
help attract and train mechanics. Ford, for example, contracted 
recently with a private training firm to provide an intensive, 
54-week training program to produce entry-level mechanics. 
Participating dealers share the cost of graduates' tuition to 
retain them. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercedes-Benz has a similar program.

	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Rescuers searched under twisted walls  
and roofs today for survivors after a landslide triggered by days 
of monsoon rains smashed into a housing development, killing at 
least 11 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 50 more people could still be trapped in the landslide,  
Defense Minister Orlando Mercado said. It was the deadliest single 
incident from four days of torrential rains that have killed a 
total 42 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a continuing downpour, police and emergency workers pulled  
injured victims, muddy and bloodied, out of the wreckage of 57 
collapsed or damaged houses in Antipolo City, east of Manila. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Asian countries also tried to assess the damage caused by  
days of torrential rains. At least 35 people were killed and 25,000 
people left homeless in South Korea, 24 died in Vietnam, and five 
were killed in Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Korea, the sun peeked out of the clouds for the first  
time in four days after the latest storm moved out of the country 
late Tuesday. Twenty-eight people were missing and 98,800 acres of 
rice paddies were washed away. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm caused rivers to overflow, breaking dikes and  
triggering deadly landslides, including one that killed 10 
vacationers. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 graves in cemeteries north of Seoul were washed away,  
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	After skirting the length of South Korea's west coast, the  
tropical storm veered into the mainland of North Korea and raced 
through its capital Pyongyang, wreaking more havoc on the 
famine-stricken country. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report by its foreign news agency, KCNA, North Korea said  
late Tuesday that the rains and strong winds ``adversely affected 
agriculture and other fields.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The storm left ``no small loss of human lives,'' it said,  
without giving specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea is in its fifth year of acute food shortages caused  
by massive floods and economic mismanagement. A U.S. congressional 
report said more than 2 million people may have died there. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thailand, about 1,000 people were homeless after five days of  
flash floods engulfed the low-lying, coastal province of 
Chanthaburi, 130 miles southeast of Bangkok. Authorities estimated 
that about 90,000 people were affected by floods. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cambodia, families took refuge on their rooftops when the  
town of Kampot, 85 miles south of Phnom Penh, was completely 
flooded. Two bridges connecting the town to higher ground 
collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Philippines, President Joseph Estrada declared a state of  
emergency Tuesday in metropolitan Manila and three nearby 
provinces. Tens of thousands of homes were flooded, and around $2 
million in damage was caused to farmland, the Department of 
Agriculture said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Antipolo, residents reported seeing cracks in their houses at  
about midday Tuesday, said Joven Gatlabayan, an assistant to the 
mayor. At mid-evening the terraced land collapsed, setting off a 
chain reaction as the top row of houses plunged into buildings 
below, survivors said. 
</P>
<P>
	A TV report said sandbags were used as the foundation for some  
houses, but officials at building's Japanese developer refused to 
comment. Some residents said they would sue the company.

<HEADLINE> Senate Won't Block Dairy Pricing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stepping into a bitter feud between the  
nation's dairy farmers, the Senate today blocked legislation aimed 
at letting New England continue fixing milk prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also would have stopped he Agriculture Department  
from overhauling the way milk is priced in the rest of the country. 
New England senators, however, fell seven votes short of breaking a 
filibuster against the legislation, which they wanted to add to a 
USDA spending bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was being closely watched by producers in New York,  
Pennsylvania and the South, who also are seeking to set milk prices 
in their states. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very clear. ... The Senate doesn't like cartels, whether  
it be for dairy or another commodity,'' said Sen. Herb Kohl, 
D-Wis., who led the filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
	Producers in the upper Midwest fear the regional compacts would  
encourage overproduction and drive down the prices they get. They 
also would be the biggest beneficiaries of USDA's new pricing 
policy, which is intended to soften regional pricing disparities. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers are voting this week on the new pricing structure. While  
it could hurt many producers outside the upper Midwest, the plan is 
expected to be approved nationwide because milk prices would 
otherwise be deregulated on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the USDA proposal are hoping that Congress will  
force the department to adopt an alternative plan that is closer to 
the current pricing system. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current system, guaranteed minimum prices for fluid  
milk are lowest in the upper Midwest and highest in the South and 
West, up to $3 per hundred pounds higher in some places, because 
the price is based on a farm's distance from Eau Claire, Wis. The 
Depression-era system was designed to spur production in areas 
where it had been scarce. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Congress set the system for elimination and ordered  
USDA to come up with a new plan.

<HEADLINE> Reds' Avery To Have Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Cincinnati Reds left-hander Steve Avery will  
have surgery Thursday to repair a partial tear in his pitching 
shoulder, ending his season. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. James Andrews examined Avery on Wednesday in Birmingham,  
Ala., and concurred that surgery is needed to repair a tear in the 
tissue on the underside of the rotator cuff. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery signed with the Reds as a free agent last December and  
went 6-7 with a 5.16 ERA in 19 starts. His control was a big 
problem -- he walked 78 in 96 innings and got progressively wilder 
as the season went along. 
</P>
<P>
	Soreness in the shoulder prompted him to go on the disabled list  
July 14. A recent magnetic resonance imaging test found the tear. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Timothy Kremchek, who will assist with the surgery, said  
doctors won't know the extent of the damage until they get inside 
the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think it's anything that will jeopardize him for next  
year,'' Kremchek said. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery agreed to a base salary of $500,000 this season with  
incentives. There's an option for next season at $3 million that 
the Reds can buy out for $1 million.

<HEADLINE> Vikings' First-Rounder Leaves Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANKATO, Minn. (AP) -- The Minnesota Vikings thought they were  
finally getting an explanation for the mysterious disappearance of 
their first-round draft pick who went AWOL after his first pro 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Pass rusher Dimitrius Underwood skipped out on the Vikings to  
attend to a ``family matter'' and was expected to return to 
training camp today, his agent said after finally tracking down the 
rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	But when morning practice started, Underwood wasn't there.  
</P>
<P>
	General manager Tim Connolly said this morning that nobody in  
the organization knew where Underwood was. 
</P>
<P>
	The first thing Underwood would have to do upon his return is  
meet with coach Dennis Green, who would decide whether to take him 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a Denny decision -- if he ever shows up,'' Connolly said.  
``Denny's irritated. I'm irritated. The whole staff is irritated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A message left with Underwood's agent, Craig Domann, wasn't  
immediately returned today. Domann's voicemail said he was out of 
the office today. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday night, Domann said that Underwood ``called to inform  
me that he was planning to be back in Mankato tonight (Tuesday). He 
apologized for the way he took off without talking to anybody or 
asking for permission from the team or even letting me know or 
anyone else know that he was doing what he was doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He had to deal with a family matter that had gotten to crisis  
proportions, and he had to take care of it,'' Domann said. ``He is 
now focusing his energies back on football. I informed him that he 
would need to be talking to coach (Dennis) Green. He said he was 
looking forward to doing that either late tonight or first thing 
tomorrow morning depending on what time he got in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domann declined to go into specifics about the player's  
explanation or the whereabouts of Underwood, the father of 
15-month-old twins. 
</P>
<P>
	Green wouldn't discuss Underwood's status after learning he had  
been located more than 24 hours after his disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, Green was clearly annoyed by the matter,  
however. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we're disappointed the guy would not want to play  
football. That's really what it comes down to,'' Green said 
following the morning practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood inexplicably disappeared from training camp Monday,  
worrying the team, his agent and his family, all concerned about 
his well being. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's been my only concern the whole time,'' assistant coach  
Andre Patterson said Tuesday before Underwood was tracked down. 
``Football's just a game. I couldn't sleep because of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domann didn't hear from his client until Tuesday evening.  
Neither did Underwood's mother and brother in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, a 6-foot-6, 276-pound defensive end from Michigan  
State, was the 29th selection in the NFL draft. He signed a 
five-year contract Sunday for more than $5 million, including a 
partially deferred signing bonus of $1,750,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings went to federal court in Minneapolis on Tuesday  
afternoon to keep Underwood from getting a $543,561.80 portion of 
his signing bonus it wired to his Milwaukee bank on Monday. 
Underwood's bank agreed to freeze the account for 48 hours. The 
lawsuit said Underwood breached his contract with the Vikings by 
failing to attend mandatory players' meetings and practices and for 
leaving training camp without permission.

<HEADLINE> Strip Class Offered at Mt. Holyoke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH HADLEY, Mass. (AP) -- Russian literature lecturer. Mother  
of two. Striptease dancer. For Susan Scotto, it's all in a day's 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Scotto, an instructor at the all-women Mount Holyoke  
College, stripped in clubs while getting her doctorate at the 
University of California at Berkeley. Now she's sharing her 
experiences with students in a noncredit how-to class in 
striptease. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Scotto says exotic dancing is an art form that pleases the  
dancer and the viewer. A class she offered on the topic last year 
was so popular that she plans to offer it again in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Sophomore Patty McCarthy was one of the 65 students who took the  
class last year. She said she would consider taking it again: ``It 
was sort of fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Students in the class view clips from movies featuring  
strippers, learn basic bump-and-grind moves and get to take home 
props, including feather boas, scarves, fans and high heels. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see any way how an exchange of pleasure is something  
to be condemned,'' Ms. Scotto told the Union-News in Springfield. 
``Someone in any form of work can feel exploited. It's all a state 
of mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reached at home, the mother of two, whose husband also teaches  
Russian at Mount Holyoke, declined to elaborate but said she stood 
by her statements. 
</P>
<P>
	College President Joanne Creighton pointed out Wednesday that  
although the class was held in a campus dance studio, the course is 
not part of the college curriculum, ``nor does Professor Scotto 
receive any pay for this noncredit class.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sally Sutherland, associate dean of faculty, said Ms. Scotto  
still dances semiprofessionally, but neither that nor the class 
goes against the 162-year-old college's feminist traditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where else but a women's college could provide a safe and  
secure place to explore the boundaries of an art form that slides 
over into pornography and exploitation?'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Peach Prices May Rise / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Georgia peach farmers say the Environmental  
Protection Agency has taken away one of their most effective 
weapons against pests by banning a chemical used on 81 percent of 
the state's peach crop. 
</P>
<P>
	The methyl parathion ban came Monday, three years after the 1996  
Food Quality Protection Act required the EPA to reassess safety 
levels for hundreds of commonly used pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are taking away the most effective and safest and best  
pesticide that we've had,'' Robert Dickey, a Crawford County peach 
farmer, said Tuesday. ``We're going to have to substitute some 
others that are more expensive and less effective. It doesn't make 
much sense to us growers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dickey said the alternative pesticides could cost three times  
more. The pesticide ban will hit Southern growers more than their 
counterparts in California because the pest that attacks South 
Carolina and Georgia peaches is not as great a problem out West, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he said, fruit imported from other countries may  
have been treated with the pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably costing us $40 or $50 an acre to spray now,'' he  
said. ``If I've got 1,000 acres of peaches, you see where my profit 
goes. The EPA just took it. It's a real blow to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dickey said he will try not to pass the extra cost on to  
consumers in order to compete with other growers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, state Agriculture Commissioner Tommy Irvin said  
consumers may have to pay more for Georgia peaches because of the 
ban. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it will be a huge cost, but it will have some  
impact on the production costs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin said he thinks consumers will be willing to spend a little  
more for Georgia peaches because ``our peaches are so much better 
in quality and taste that the price doesn't become a big factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peach farmer Al Pearson said the agricultural community cannot  
absorb every regulatory action of the government and still maintain 
a profit level that will allow farmers to stay in business. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the American consumer should expect food prices to go  
up when the tools that have been efficient have been removed,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Azinphosmethyl, an insecticide used on 11 percent of the apples  
grown in Georgia, has also been banned. 
</P>
<P>
	The pesticides have been controversial because of concern that  
the residue levels the government deems acceptable pose risks to 
infants and children. Allowable residue levels for many pesticides 
were set decades ago, when the potential health impacts on infants 
and children were not taken into account. 
</P>
<P>
	The cessation date for using methyl parathion hasn't been  
issued. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin said peaches from this year's crop are safe to eat even  
though they have been sprayed with the pesticide. There is no 
evidence that the pesticide has ever caused harm, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``On one hand you hear them say that it's not an immediate  
danger. It's nothing to panic about,'' Pearson said. ``It makes me 
wonder if it's not a little overreaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Ausfeld of Atlanta bought a half-dozen large peaches  
at the Harris Teeter supermarket in Dunwoody on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not immediately concerned, because they really haven't  
told us what the stuff can do to us. I have to know more about it 
before I get worried,'' she said. ``Besides, it's July and I have 
to have my peaches.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Commerce Department reports factory orders  
for July at 10 a.m. EDT today. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket manufactured goods rose  
0.3 percent in June, boosted by gains in autos and electronic 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase followed a 0.8 percent gain in May, and a drop of  
2.4 percent in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. economy is poised to keep growing at least through the  
first half of 2000, leaving it on track for achieving the longest 
expansion ever, according to a key gauge of future activity 
released yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board said today that its Index of Leading  
Economic Indicators, which is designed to help spot turning points 
in the economy, rose 0.3 in June to 107.7. That matched the May 
increase and brought gains in the indicator to eight out of the 
past nine months. The last decline, in April, was 0.1 
</P>
<P>
	The longest economic expansion in U.S. history lasted for 106  
months, from February 1962 until December 1969. The current 
expansion, which began in March 1991, would match the record if it 
continues through January 2000 and pass it if it lasts until 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	``The expansion is firmly on track,'' said Michael Boldin,  
director of business cycle research at the Conference Board. But 
because of concerns that the Federal Reserve may raise interest 
rates again to fight inflation ``some volatility can be expected in 
the second half of 1999,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets had little reaction to the report by the  
business-financed research group based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said that, if anything, it confirmed that the economy  
is growing at a slow and steady pace of about 2.7 percent annually, 
which should not meaningfully accelerate inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's figures came as investors were trying to predict  
whether the Fed would raise short-term interest rates for a second 
time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank increased rates by a quarter point on June 30  
in a pre-emptive strike against inflation. Its chairman, Alan 
Greenspan, has warned it is prepared to act quickly again on any 
signs of rekindled inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said that Tuesday's report did not signal that  
inflation is in danger of getting out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank ``may have to come in and do a small adjustment  
in rates,'' said Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One 
Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio. ``But this report is not 
telling the Fed that there's any kind of panic here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the 10 indicators that make up the leading index rose  
in June. The most significant increases came in manufacturers' new 
orders of consumer goods and materials, in money supply, and in the 
difference between long-term and short-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in a sign that the labor market may not be heating up  
enough to push up wages -- a key component of the inflation picture 
-- the average number of hours worked per week by production workers 
-- was unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board's index of current economic activity rose  
by 0.4 to 124.6 in June. But its lagging index decreased by 0.4 to 
108. The indexes are calculated from a base of 100, set in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``Taken together, the three composite indexes and their  
components show a very health economy,'' the Conference Board 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Thayer, chief economist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St.  
Louis, noted that other recent reports show that economic growth is 
slowing. Last week, the Commerce Department reported that economic 
growth has slowed to an annual rate of 2.3 percent in the second 
quarter from 4.3 percent in the first three months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	A report Monday from an organization of industrial executives  
suggested manufacturing growth has slowed. And while Americans' 
wages and benefits surged in the second quarter by the largest 
amount since 1991, Thayer noted that help-wanted advertising is at 
its lowest level in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Thayer said, higher long-term interest rates should  
brake the economy even further. Thirty-year mortgages topped 8 
percent this week for the first time in more than two years. That 
should further slow the housing market, which is already reporting 
a sharp drop in new construction and refinancings. 
</P>
<P>
	Chan said the next important clue to the pace of growth in the  
economy will be provided Friday with a report on the July 
unemployment rate. Until then, he said, ``I think the economy is 
steady as she goes.''

<HEADLINE> Beatles Giving Eurostar a Makeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A London-to-Paris train that travels under the  
English Channel will be repainted ``Yellow Submarine''-style to 
launch a digitally enhanced version of the Beatles' 1968 animated 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
	The surviving Beatles -- Paul McCartney, George Harrison and  
Ringo Starr -- are paying more than $160,000 to transform the 
Eurostar train, The Sun newspaper reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of yards of plastic panels painted with psychedelic  
cartoons from the movie will be used to remake the train, which 
will make its first journey Sept. 8, Eurostar said. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie will be relaunched about a week earlier in the  
Beatles' hometown of Liverpool. A remixed version of the ``Yellow 
Submarine'' album also is being released.

<HEADLINE> PGA Tour Charities Hit $500 Million  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	What began 61 years ago with a $10,000 contribution hit a major  
milestone Wednesday as charitable donations from tournaments run by 
the PGA Tour hit $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the money, it's what it does for people,''  
commissioner Tim Finchem said. ``It cements the relationships 
between our tournaments, the people who run them, the players who 
compete in them and the communities we visit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The growth of charitable contributions has nearly doubled since  
Finchem took over as commissioner in 1994. Last year alone, PGA 
Tour events raised about $39.7 million for charities. 
</P>
<P>
	The $500 million milestone represents charitable donations from  
all three of its tours. The Senior Tour has contributed nearly $70 
million since 1989, while the Nike Tour has added nearly $15 
million over the past nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	Not included is what players contribute on their own.  
</P>
<P>
	The announcement comes a day after Billy Andrade and Brad Faxon  
held the CVS Charity Classic in Rhode Island. Over the past nine 
years, they have raised more than $1.65 million for children's and 
women's charities in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Norman's Shark Shootout raised $1 million in November for  
children's cancer research, among other things. Fred Couples and 
Peter Jacobsen have charity tournaments in the Northwest. Tiger 
Woods will have his first such event, raising money for his 
foundation, at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of them see what golf can do for charity and have their  
own charity tournaments,'' Finchem said. ``It has become a part of 
the fabric of the PGA Tour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 80 percent of the PGA Tour events are dedicated to  
charity, meaning they contribute 100 percent of their net proceeds 
-- from revenue such as ticket sales and corporate hospitality tents 
-- to charity. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of these designate a single charity, such as the St. Jude  
Children's Research Hospital (Memphis) and the Egleston Hospital 
for Children (BellSouth Classic in Atlanta). Others, such as The 
Players Championship, divide their contributions among several 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The Byron Nelson Classic last year donated $4.3 million from its  
net proceeds -- top among PGA Tour events -- to the Salesmanship Club 
of Dallas. Its beneficiary is the Youth and Family Centers, which 
serves at-risk youth in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it reflects the necessary commitment we have,''  
Finchem said. ``It's clear the relationship with charitable 
contributions has grown on the PGA Tour to the point that we're 
only going to add tournaments that are committed to charity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tournaments such as the Bay Hill Invitational, started by Arnold  
Palmer, and Jack Nicklaus' Memorial Tournament are not required to 
donate their entire proceeds to charity but ``still make 
substantial contributions,'' Finchem said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first contribution was $10,000 by the Palm Beach  
Invitational in 1938, and the total contribution reached $1 million 
in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	The next stop: $1 billion.

<HEADLINE> Pediatricians Suggest Limits on TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tinky Winky, Dipsy, Laa-Laa and Po have  
something to say to pediatricians: Back off, docs. 
</P>
<P>
	The distributor of ``Teletubbies,'' the only television show  
aimed at children younger than 2, says the American Academy of 
Pediatrics' advice to keep those youngsters away from the tube is 
unrealistic for today's parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bunch of malarkey,'' said Kenn Viselman, president of  
the itsy bitsy Entertainment Co., which distributes the British 
series on PBS stations. 
</P>
<P>
	The academy said research shows babies need direct interaction  
with parents and other caregivers for healthy brain growth. 
Watching TV may also interfere with interaction that helps develop 
their social, emotional and cognitive skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Pediatricians should advise parents to keep children's rooms  
``electronic media-free,'' the academy said in a report published 
in this month's issue of the journal Pediatrics. 
</P>
<P>
	During routine visits, doctors should begin asking how children  
of all ages use TV, videos and computers, the report said. It even 
urged pediatricians to set an example by turning off the television 
in their waiting rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think this takes into account the way parents raise  
their children anymore,'' Viselman said. ``Parents use TV in three 
ways -- as an educator, a treat and a baby sitter. That's not going 
to change, and this report is not going to change it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Teletubbies,'' which premiered last year in the United States,  
features four colorful characters with a TV set implanted in their 
stomachs. They use the cooing voices that toddlers are used to 
hearing from adults and constantly ask questions designed to pique 
the curiosity of young viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Viselman said there's nothing wrong with shows like  
``Teletubbies'' and educational programs. Parents should instead 
avoid letting their kids watch ``The Jerry Springer Show,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But an expert in children's TV said even ``Teletubbies'' creates  
problems, claiming that PBS gave some parents the false feeling 
that their children would be missing something important if they 
didn't watch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's preposterous to put children under 2 in front of the  
TV,'' said Peggy Charren of Action For Children's Television, a 
group that lobbies for quality programming for kids. ``You should 
wait as long as possible, because once they get into it, it's 
awfully hard to turn it off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown Johnson, a senior vice president at Nickelodeon, said the  
academy's report ``very consistent with what we're trying to do. 
The cable network has programming aimed at children aged 2-5, but 
nothing for toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
	That's partly because research shows that most children need to  
be at least 2 to follow stories on television. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen Media Research, which measures TV viewing, also doesn't  
include children under age 2 in its research. So there's no 
financial incentive for advertiser-supported networks to reach this 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any message that gets parents to spend more face time with  
their kids, especially when they're babies, is a wonderful thing,'' 
Ms. Johnson said. ``An electronic device can never take the place 
of a human being.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Swimming Team in Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Maybe the United States swimming squad  
at the Pan American Games should be labeled a ``B'' team, after 
all. 
</P>
<P>
	While the athletes and coaches disdained that tag prior to the  
competition, the confused Americans are losing at an alarming rate. 
</P>
<P>
	With 10 events completed, they have only two gold medals, both  
by men. The women are winless in five events, all won by Canadians. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-two events remain, putting the Americans in danger of  
making their worst showing ever. That was four years ago at Mar del 
Plata, Argentina, where they lost 10 of 32 races, four by the women 
and a record six by the men. The most women's losses ever was six 
in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	Never have the rest of the countries combined to beat the  
Americans in total golds, men or women. The closest call for the 
women came in 1955, when they won four golds and the other 
countries also combined for four. The tightest battle for the men 
was in 1951, when they edged the opposition 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, the Americans have dominated in the pool. In 1959 and  
1963, the men and women were 8-0 each in golds, The men also went 
undefeated in 1979, winning all 15 golds, were 15-1 in 1987 and 
14-1 in both 1971 and 1975. The women went 13-1 in both 1975 and 
1979 and 13-2 in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	Typifying this year's woes was Tuesday's performances by Jarod  
Schroeder and Sabir Muhammad in the men's 100-meter butterfly. 
Neither made the final, meaning the U.S. team would not win a medal 
in an individual event for the first time since 1955 and only the 
second time ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was shocked,'' Muhammad, the American record-holder for 50  
and 100 meters in short-course competition, said. 
</P>
<P>
	He blamed his unexpected failure on a horrible dive.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was the worst dive I've ever had in a swim race,'' Muhammad  
said. ``I went four meters, straight down. My usual dive is a lot 
shallower than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The disappointed Schroeder's problem also was his start.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was slow out of the blocks,'' he said. ``I think I was the  
last into the water. 
</P>
<P>
	``I then tried to force the issue, but I wasn't very efficient  
on my stroke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The poor showings surprised the team.  
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't expecting that,'' Eric Donnelly, the silver  
medalist in Tuesday night's 400 individual medley, said. ``Everyone 
was expecting them to be in the top eight and in the medals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a shock. But I don't think anyone let it get to them.''  
</P>
<P>
	Donnelly, for one, didn't let it affect his performance. He  
lowered his career-best by two seconds in winning his preliminary 
heat, then chopped another two seconds off his time in the final, 
finishing in 4 minutes 17.86 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Donnelly was beaten by Canada's Curtis Myden, who was timed in a  
1999 world-leading and Pan Ams record 4:15.52. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think the race would go that fast,'' Donnelly said  
after competing in his first international race. ``I thought just 
under 4:19 would win. After this morning, I wanted to get the 
record, but he beat me to it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not too disappointed.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Americans' only gold Tuesday night came in the final event,  
the men's 800 freestyle relay. Adam Messner, Dan Phillips, Devin 
Howard and Scott Tucker combined to swim 7:22.29. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other finals, Canada's Jessica Deglau won the women's 200  
freestyle at 2:00.65, only .04 seconds off the Canadian record; her 
teammate, Lauren Van Oosten, took the women's 200 breaststroke at 
2:30.36; and Venezuela's Francisco Sanchez won the men's 100 
butterfly in a Games record 53.33. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadians now have six swimming golds, as many as they  
accumulated at the 1995 games, and a total of 11 medals. The U.S. 
also has 11 medals, but only two golds. 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight's finals are the women's 400 freestyle, 100 backstroke  
and 400 freestyle relay, and the men's 100 freestyle and 200 
backstroke. 
</P>
<P>
	In today's prelims, all the Americans advanced, with Aaron  
Peirsol of Irvine, Calif., and Dan Shevcik of Wilton, Conn., 
posting the two-fastest times in the men's 200 backstroke, and 
Denali Knapp of Davis, Calif., registering the quickest time in the 
women's 100 backstroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Peirsol won his heat at 2:00.39 and Shevcik was second at  
2:01.58. Knapp was timed at 1:02.78 in winning her heat.

<HEADLINE> Pan American Games Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- On one of the busiest days of the Pan  
American Games, with Americans featured on the tennis and 
basketball court, in the pool and the ring, it was Cuban high jump 
great Javier Sotomayor who drew the spotlight -- even though he is 
back in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor, the biggest name in the event, lost his gold medal  
Wednesday for testing positive for cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor's urine sample showed cocaine in the amount of 200  
parts per million, which would be consistent with a person who uses 
the drug, Eduardo de Rose, medical chief for the Pan Am Games 
committee, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban officials insisted Sotomayor never took cocaine and  
charged the substance was planted in something he ate or drank. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has told us he has not taken this substance and we believe  
his word,'' said professor Rodrigo Alvarez Cambra, director of the 
orthopedic complex of Cuba. ``That is why we know this is a 
manipulation ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor will be suspended by the international track  
federation for two years, which includes the world championships 
later this month and the Sydney Olympics. But the Cubans plan to 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexandra Stevenson's upset stomach led to her being upset in  
the semifinals of the tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	She pounded her powerful groundstrokes, as usual, but this time  
they didn't stay in the court for the 18-year-old, the first woman 
qualifier to reach the Wimbledon semifinals earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Spraying unforced errors all over the hardcourts at the Winnipeg  
Lawn Tennis Club, Stevenson was knocked out of the tournament 
Wednesday 6-0, 6-3 by Venezuela's Maria Vento. 
</P>
<P>
	Vento will play Tara Snyder of Houston in the final.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little off. It could have been something I ate last  
night. I don't know, but she played well. I knew she would be a 
tough player,'' Stevenson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just late for the ball a lot and that's why I was  
missing. You just feel dizzy sometimes. And sometimes when you feel 
like that, you have to play tough. I tried but it didn't work out 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Stevenson settls for bronze, Snyder beat Argentina's  
Mariana Diaz-Olivia 6-2, 6-2 and will face Vento, who has been 
ranked as high as 31st on the WTA tour, in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson was the field's biggest draw, as much for the news  
that she is the daughter of Hall of Fame basketball player Julius 
Erving as for her remarkable run at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	Her stay at the Pan Ams has been fun, she said. Her plans are to  
root for her teammates this week, do lunch with beach volleyball 
players and then head out to a night club to dance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't been in all the fuss. It's pretty normal, I mean  
nothing's changed,'' Stevenson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I will stay the same person. It shouldn't affect your  
game. If it does, something is wrong. I only got to the semis at 
Wimbledon, I didn't win it. I got a lot of work ahead of me. This 
is just the beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In men's play, Paul Goldstein of Rockville, Md., meets Cecil  
Mamiit of Los Angeles for the gold. Goldstein routed Paulo Taicher 
of Brazil, 6-1, 6-0, while Mamiit beat David Nalbandian of 
Argentina 6-3, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Tucker of Cincinnati rallied in the fourth round to stun  
Cuba's Waldemar Font in the semifinals of boxing. The bantamweight 
loss was the first for a Cuban in the games; Font was the 1997 
world silver medalist. 
</P>
<P>
	``He kept coming through my defense,'' said Tucker, who won 8-7  
after trailing 6-5 through three rounds. ``I knew going into the 
fourth round it was now or never.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker faces Venezuela's Neouar Cermeno on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Freestyler Kaitlin Sandeno broke Canada's stranglehold on  
women's swimming, but the U.S. team set two ignominious records. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandeno, 16, of Lake Forest, Calif., won the women's 400-meter  
freestyle in a career-best 4:10.74 seconds for America's first 
women's victory after five consecutive losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The total of only three gold medals in 15 events so far marks a  
low point for the U.S. team and seven losses for the women also 
constitutes a record.

	Both U.S. basketball teams won. The men finished first in their  
pool by beating the Dominican Republic 95-83 thanks to a surge from 
a 20-point first-half deficit. Travis Williams scored 24 points, 
the most by an American thus far in the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went into this game blindfolded,'' Kermit Holmes said. ``We  
got a good talk at halftime to go over strategy and what we needed 
to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The women used a stingy defense in the second half to beat  
Canada 62-46. The hosts scored only 18 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a lot to do with why they missed shots,'' coach Nell  
Fortner said. ``Our defense was just tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By losing to Argentina 5-2 in women's field hockey, the  
Americans missed out on an automatic berth for Sydney. But they 
still can qualify in a tournament next March.

<HEADLINE> The ABCs of Back-to-School Budgeting / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the next few weeks, millions of youngsters  
will be trading in their tennis rackets and swimsuits for book bags 
and jackets -- and their parents will be faced with yet another 
round of seasonal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Back-to-school necessities can add up rather quickly. There's  
$30 for that new backpack; $40 for gym shorts, $50 for cheerleading 
uniform rentals, $100 for new software to help with homework. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the American household -- particularly those that don't  
budget year-round -- will get some pretty nasty surprises during 
this time of year,'' said Durant Abernethy, president of the 
nonprofit National Foundation for Consumer Credit in Silver Spring, 
Md. 
</P>
<P>
	He says the NFCC's 1,500 credit-counseling offices nationwide  
routinely see an increase in activity by late autumn -- when the 
bills for back-to-school supplies and clothing start rolling in, 
along with some leftover summer vacation bills. Many households 
handle these extra expenses by charging them on their credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Most people, though, can avoid going into debt if they properly  
budget for seasonal expenses simply by setting aside enough extra 
money to handle them throughout the year. Some financial counselors 
suggest establishing a special interest-bearing account for 
non-recurring expenses like insurance, vacations, holiday gifts or 
back-to-school supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something that should be done. (But) the reality of  
anyone doing a budget is not great,'' said Howard Dvorkin, 
president of Consolidated Credit Counseling Services, a nonprofit 
service in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The group publishes a pamphlet, ``Budgeting 101: Your Money  
Guide for Getting Through School,'' available free of charge 
through its Web site (www.debtfree.org) or by calling 
1-800-SAVE-ME2. The focus is on college students, though much of 
information can be useful for high school students or parents of 
children in lower grades. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the NFCC said it welcomes parents and students to  
drop in on any of its offices for budgeting tips and counseling, 
free of charge or for a nominal fee. To locate the nearest office, 
visit the Web site (www.nfcc.org) or call 1-800-388-2227. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are some suggestions from the credit counseling experts to  
help parents and students plan for and save on back-to-school 
expenses: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Estimate expenses. Sit down with each child returning to  
school and list every expense you can think of, from notebooks to 
blue jeans. (Don't forget items like haircuts or annual physical 
checkups, too.) Then have the student come up with an estimate of 
the cost. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Establish a budget. Total all those expenses, then set  
spending limits for each child. At this point, you'll need to 
determine what you can pay cash for and what you'll need to charge 
on your credit card. (Remember: Whatever you put on plastic should 
be paid off within 90 days.) 
</P>
<P>
	-- Determine wants vs. needs. While school supplies are  
essential, the latest in footwear isn't. Therefore, it's important 
to differentiate the luxuries from the necessities. Tell your child 
how much you think is reasonable to spend and what amount you're 
willing to pay, and have your child make up the difference either 
with his allowance or money saved from a summer job. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Comparison shop. Prices will vary from store to store. Office  
supply stores, volume discounters and warehouses often offer the 
best deals. Also, take advantage of advertised specials during the 
few weeks before school starts, and take your children along while 
you shop so they can see firsthand the benefit of budgeting. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Be creative. Make ample use of hand-me-downs in your own  
family. Shop resale stores or consignment shops for used clothing. 
If your child wears a uniform, ask if the school offers a uniform 
exchange program as an alternative to buying expensive new clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Plan ahead for next year. Remember that many schools  
distribute lists at the end of the school year of the supplies 
required for the next grade level. If you start at the beginning of 
summer, you could spread your school purchases over a period of 
time, thereby allowing you to pay with cash instead of on credit. 
Also, if there's a big sale on standard school supplies you know 
your child can use the following year, stock up on them now.

<HEADLINE> Feds Chime In on Pan Am Drug Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Whether it's muscle-building steroids or a  
street drug like cocaine, athletes who use banned substances should 
face the same sanctions, anti-drug experts said Wednesday in the 
wake of sport's latest scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the case of Javier Sotomayor, the Cuban  
high-jump star who tested positive for cocaine at the Pan American 
Games, contained elements similar to that of Ben Johnson, the 
Canadian sprinter who was thrown out of the 1988 Olympics for 
steroid use. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Ben Johnson thing clearly underscored the magnitude of the  
steroid problem and the use of performance enhancers,'' said Dr. 
Gary Wadler, a Long Island, N.Y., researcher who had studied and 
written about doping in sports. ``The Sotomayor situation shows 
again that athletes are susceptible to the foibles of the world, 
and cocaine poses a serious problem to our society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, the White House drug office said all doping cases  
should be viewed in the context of using illicit substances in an 
area that demands fair play and high standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cocaine is a devastating drug that destroys lives and the  
people who use it,'' said Bob Weiner, a spokesman for Gen. Barry 
McCaffrey, the federal drug policy director. 
</P>
<P>
	While refusing to discuss the Sotomayor case specifically,  
Weiner said any test that finds an athlete using banned substances 
for whatever reason ``emphasizes the need for concerted action 
against drugs in sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that McCaffrey has pressed the International Olympic  
Committee for strong, consistent anti-doping measures, such as 
year-round drug testing and an independent agency to police doping 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	A two-time Olympic gold medalist and the only person to high  
jump 8 feet, Sotomayor was the biggest name athlete to flunk a drug 
test since Johnson tested positive for the steroid Stanozolol at 
the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was stripped of his gold medal in the 100 meters and his  
world-record time of 9.79 seconds was erased from the books. 
</P>
<P>
	Wadler said there was an important difference between the cases  
of Sotomayor and Johnson. While the sprinter took steroids solely 
to boost performance, ``there is little evidence to suggest that 
cocaine has a performance-enhancing effect,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Wadler said, organizations draw up lists of banned  
drugs for reasons other than what the substance can do to 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is the performance-enhancing aspect, the role-model  
aspect and the health aspect,'' he said. ``An organization must 
known what it wants to do with its list before placing a substance 
on that list.''

<HEADLINE> NFL Training Camp Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANKATO, Minn. (AP) -- The Minnesota Vikings are finally getting  
some answers to the mysterious disappearance of their first-round 
draft pick who went AWOL after his first NFL practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Pass rusher Dimitrius Underwood skipped out on the Vikings to  
attend to a ``family matter'' and planned to return to training 
camp today, his agent said after finally tracking down the rookie, 
whose unexcused absence irritated the coaching staff and caused 
many to worry about his safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``He called to inform me that he was planning to be back in  
Mankato tonight. He apologized for the way he took off without 
talking to anybody or asking for permission from the team or even 
letting me know or anyone else know that he was doing what he was 
doing,'' agent Craig Domann said Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dennis Green wouldn't discuss Underwood's status after  
learning that the rookie was located more than 24 hours after his 
mysterious disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, Green was clearly annoyed by the matter.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we're disappointed the guy would not want to play  
football. That's really what it comes down to,'' Green said 
following Tuesday morning's practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Domann declined to go into specifics about the family matter or  
the whereabouts of Underwood, the father of 15-month-old twins. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had to deal with a family matter that had gotten to crisis  
proportions, and he had to take care of it,'' Domann said. ``He is 
now focusing his energies back on football. I informed him that he 
would need to be talking to coach Green. He said he was looking 
forward to doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood inexplicably disappeared from training camp Monday,  
worrying the team, his agent and his family, all concerned about 
his well-being. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's been my only concern the whole time,'' assistant coach  
Andre Patterson said Tuesday before Underwood was tracked down. 
``Football's just a game. I couldn't sleep because of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domann didn't hear from his client until Tuesday evening.  
Neither did Underwood's mother and brother in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, a 6-foot-6, 276-pound defensive end from Michigan  
State, was the 29th selection in the NFL draft. He signed a 
five-year contract Sunday for more than $5 million, including a 
partially deferred signing bonus of $1,750,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings went to federal court in Minneapolis on Tuesday to  
keep Underwood from getting a $543,561.80 portion of his signing 
bonus it wired to his Milwaukee bank on Monday. Underwood's bank 
agreed to freeze the account for 48 hours. The lawsuit said 
Underwood breached his contract with the Vikings by failing to 
attend mandatory players meetings and practices and for leaving 
training camp without permission. 
</P>
<P>
	Domann dropped off his client at the team's dorm Sunday  
afternoon, and Underwood, dressed in military fatigues, proclaimed: 
``It feels good to be in Minnesota, a long anticipation. I got the 
war fatigues, got the Army fatigues, got to go to war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He participated in Monday morning's workout, ate lunch with his  
teammates, then between noon and the players meeting at 3 p.m., he 
vanished, leaving most of his clothes and personal items, including 
a Bible, in his room. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings issued a statement saying Underwood, who missed his  
senior season at Michigan State because of an ankle injury, left 
camp without permission and without telling anybody where he was 
going or why. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive coordinator Foge Fazio said nothing occurred during  
the morning practice that would have indicated there was a problem. 
And his roommate, rookie defensive end Talance Sawyer, said 
Underwood never said anything about leaving camp, although he said 
Underwood received a phone call shortly before his disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Green refused to say what, if any, disciplinary action Underwood  
faced for his unexcused absence from three workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood is expected to back up Stalin Colinet at left end.  
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
                              *Bears    	
</P>
<P>
	Cade McNown took part in his first practice with the Chicago  
Bears after signing his contract 11 days into camp. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown, the 12th pick overall, ended his holdout Monday with a  
contract that could pay him up to $22 million over five years. The 
initial deal is for seven years and $15 million, but the last two 
years are voidable and he can make an additional $7 million in 
performance-based incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	He arrived late Monday after a solo drive from Chicago that  
included several wrong turns and a slight mishap when he discovered 
he didn't have any 75 cents change for a toll booth. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Cowboys    	
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Deion Sanders will not return to the team until  
September, and even that may be a bit optimistic, team owner Jerry 
Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders is in training camp, but not practicing with Dallas as  
he rehabilitates his left big toe. He underwent surgery to fix an 
extreme case of turf toe in April. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been no estimate of when the All-Pro cornerback might  
suit up until Tuesday, when Jones said: ``I see him really trying 
to push himself sometime in September.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Jones also noted that if Sanders sits for all of  
September, he would miss only two games because Dallas has an early 
bye week. The Cowboys' third game is Oct. 3 against division rival 
Arizona in Texas Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
                            *Buccaneers    	
</P>
<P>
	First-round draft pick Anthony McFarland agreed to terms with  
Tampa Bay, ending a three-day training camp holdout. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Rich McKay said the 6-foot, 300-pound defensive  
tackle from LSU would arrive to sign the deal Tuesday night and 
practice today. 
</P>
<P>
	McFarland was the first defensive lineman selected in the draft  
and 15th pick overall. His contract is believed to be worth more 
than $6 million for five years, including a $4 million signing 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Giants    	
</P>
<P>
	Jason Sehorn's attempt to return to the New York Giants' lineup  
is going to be delayed about another 10 days because of a torn 
hamstring in his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
	The cornerback, who missed all of last season with a serious  
knee injury, had the tear detected Monday night after undergoing an 
MRI in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	It is almost certain that Sehorn will miss the Giants preseason  
opener at Minnesota on Aug. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the NFL's top cover cornerbacks, Sehorn injured the  
hamstring working out about three weeks before training camp 
opened. He didn't think it was serious then, but it cramped about a 
week before camp opened. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Falcons    	
</P>
<P>
	Jamal Anderson wasn't on hand for Atlanta's two workouts and is  
now facing at least $30,000 in fines -- the maximum $5,000 per day -- 
even if he reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pro Bowl running back, set to make $2.6 million in the final  
year of his deal, is seeking a five-year contract with an $8 
million signing bonus. The Falcons have offered a $7 million bonus 
and at least $1 million less in guaranteed money over the life of 
the contract. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Titans    	
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee quarterback Steve McNair left Tuesday morning's  
practice with back spasms. 
</P>
<P>
	He was treated and is not expected to miss any workouts. The  
afternoon session was limited to special teams, so McNair, who has 
started the last 33 regular-season games, was not scheduled to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Dolphins    	
</P>
<P>
	Tyrone Wheatley, a bust for the New York Giants, lasted less  
than a week into training camp with Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheatley was unimpressive in the Dolphins' first scrimmage  
Sunday. He carried seven times for 18 yards. Wheatley, 27, was the 
Giants' first-round draft choice in 1995. But he started just eight 
games in four seasons and carried only 14 times for 52 yards last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins acquired Wheatley from New York in February for a  
seventh-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Patriots    	
</P>
<P>
	New England coach Pete Carroll said the left knee injury  
suffered by tight end Ben Coates in practice Monday was nowhere 
near as serious as reported. Carroll termed the injury ``a very 
mild strain'' and said the veteran Pro Bowler's status would be 
evaluated on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Coates is unlikely to participate in Saturday's intrasquad  
scrimmage at Foxboro Stadium.

<HEADLINE>  Atlanta Mourns Shooting Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- An investor's killing spree that took 13 lives,  
including his own, taught Atlanta a lesson about the power of 
unity, Mayor Bill Campbell told mourners at a citywide memorial 
service today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we come together as one Atlanta -- beyond race, beyond  
borders, beyond religion,'' he told the crowd that nearly filled 
the 1,125-seat Peachtree Road United Methodist Church. 
</P>
<P>
	Religious leaders from different faiths remembered the victims  
and offered words of encouragement during the service, held just 
blocks from where Mark O. Barton killed nine of his victims at two 
brokerage offices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ernest Hemingway wrote, 'Life breaks us all and for many we  
become strong at the broken places,''' said the Rev. Don Harp, 
pastor of the church. ``We have gathered as a community to express 
that we are at one of those broken places. We gather to reaffirm 
our understanding of life and, unfortunately, death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harp also read a letter from President Clinton extending his  
sympathy to the victims' families and the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Candles were lit at the front of the church for each of the nine  
shooting victims and for Barton's wife, Leigh Ann, and children, 
11-year-old Matthew and 8-year-old Mychelle, who were bludgeoned to 
death in the days before the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton killed himself hours after his rampage when police  
cornered him about 30 miles northwest of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Also honored with candles today were six members of an Atlanta  
family slain in their home July 12 and two Cobb County police 
officers killed in a standoff with a gunman July 23. 
</P>
<P>
	The last of Barton's victims were buried Tuesday. About 300  
mourners gathered at River of Life Family Church to eulogize Joe 
Dessert, 60, a former real estate broker who, like Barton, had 
taken up the risky investment method known as day trading.

<HEADLINE> Colt's Tough Draw for Hambletonian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Don't blame Bob Stewart for  
wondering if he'll ever catch a break in the Hambletonian. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who trains Angus Hall, thought everything was going his  
way after his colt won an elimination last week by 4 1/2 lengths in a 
career-best 1:54 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days later, Angus Hall had the misfortune to draw the No.  
9 post position for Saturday's $1 million final for trotting's 
biggest race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we'd overcome everything,'' Stewart said. ``Then  
came the draw. Still, I really believe he'll be good Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Angus Hall has a first, a second and two thirds in four starts  
this year. Stewart didn't plan it that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were going to take him to Canada but he got sick,'' Stewart  
said. ``It took him three weeks to get well and another three weeks 
before he was ready to run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His full brother, 1998 Hambletonian entrant Conway Hall, the  
1997 2-year-old trotting colt of the year, had similar problems 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Conway Hall developed a bone cyst on his stifle and lost 45 days  
of training. He drew the ninth post for the Hambletonian, finishing 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was worse last year,'' Stewart said. ``This horse is  
bigger, stronger and has more tactical speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So what is the strategy for Saturday?  
</P>
<P>
	``I believe you hire the best driver you can get,'' said  
Stewart, who will have five-time Hambletonian winner John Campbell 
in the bike. ``John knows the horses and he knows the other 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we drew the 10 hole for the Beacon Course we decided not  
to race him too hard with the Hambo in mind,'' Stewart said. ``But 
on Saturday I'll leave it up to John. He won the Meadowlands Pace 
from the 10-hole'' this year with The Panderosa. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell, the youngest driver ever to be elected to the Harness  
Racing Hall of Fame and the sports' career earnings leader, was 
tight-lipped about his plan for Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish we had drawn better,'' Campbell said. ``But it's only a  
starting point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The horse to beat in this year's Hambletonian is Self Possessed.  
Because of common ownership and trainers, the colt will be part of 
a heavily favored three-horse entry that includes Angus Hall and 
Raffaello Ambrosio. 
</P>
<P>
	Self Possessed tied the Meadowlands track record for 3-year-old  
trotting colts of 1:52 2-5. The Mike Lachance-driven colt drew the 
No. 4 post on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The team of Lachance and trainer Ron Gurfein will be shooting  
for a third Hambletonian victory in five years, after winning with 
Victory Dream in 1994 and Continentalvictory in 1996.

<HEADLINE> HIV Levels Influence Transmission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The higher the level of HIV in a pregnant woman's blood, the  
more likely she was to transmit the virus to her baby, researchers 
reported today in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers also found that pregnant women with the highest  
levels of HIV were one-third less likely to transmit the virus if 
they were treated with the anti-retroviral drug AZT than those who 
were not. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers concluded that aggressive anti-retroviral  
therapy is probably the best way to lower the risk that babies will 
be born with AIDS. However, they warned that the benefits must be 
weighed against the possible long-term effects of the drug, which 
are unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	One study, led by Dr. Lynne Mofenson of the National Institutes  
of Health, looked at women who were treated with AZT while pregnant 
and whose babies also were treated with the drug for several weeks 
after birth. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 84 mothers in the study who had undetectable levels of  
the HIV at 20 to 30 weeks of pregnancy, none of the babies tested 
positive for HIV. 
</P>
<P>
	The second study, led by Dr. Patricia Garcia of Northwestern  
University, looked at 552 pregnant women from 1990 to 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	It found that among women with the highest levels of HIV,  
representing the most advanced cases of AIDS, 20 percent of those 
who had been treated with AZT transmitted the virus to their babies 
compared to a 63 percent transmission rate among those not treated 
with AZT. 
</P>
<P>
	In countries that cannot afford AZT treatment, about one-fourth  
of all babies born to HIV-positive mothers get the virus. Since AZT 
therapy became standard in the United States, that rate has dropped 
to 9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Troops Seal Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEBRON, West Bank (AP) -- Israeli troops sealed the troubled and  
divided city of Hebron today, a day after two Jewish settlers were 
wounded in an ambush blamed on Palestinian militants. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting was the first attack on Israelis since moderate  
Prime Minister Ehud Barak took office last month and came at a time 
of tension between Israel and the Palestinian Authority over 
implementation of the Wye River peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak has hinted he would break off negotiations with the  
Palestinians over terror attacks and said after Tuesday's shooting 
that he would wage an uncompromising war against terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the army's response was in line with previous  
practices. Troops imposed a curfew on the Israeli-controlled 
downtown area of Hebron and set up roadblocks around the city, 
barring Palestinians from leaving and entering. 
</P>
<P>
	Streets were deserted today in the Israeli sector, which is home  
to 30,000 Palestinians and 450 Jewish settlers. The Palestinians 
were confined to their homes while the settlers were allowed to 
move freely. Palestinian residents watched from the windows as 
Israeli troops searched homes and questioned people. 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen teen-agers threw stones at Israeli troops.  
</P>
<P>
	In Tuesday's attack, gunmen opened fire on two settlers driving  
through downtown Hebron en route to their homes in the tiny Jewish 
enclave of Tel Romeida in the heart of a Palestinian neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the victims, Ephraim Rosenstein, who lost two fingers in  
the attack, demanded that Barak respond harshly. ``I would expect 
that Barak, as a proven security hawk, would do something ... more 
than just words,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak demanded that the Palestinian Authority track down the  
gunmen who apparently fled into the Palestinian-controlled part of 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Major Gen. Yitzhak Eitan, the Israeli army official in charge of  
the West Bank, complained that the Palestinian Authority was not 
doing enough to catch the attackers. A meeting between Israeli and 
Palestinian security officials set for today was canceled because 
of the shooting, Israel's army radio said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians, meanwhile, renewed their criticism of Barak,  
saying he was trying to get out of a full implementation of the Wye 
accord under which Israel is to withdraw from 13.1 percent of the 
West Bank in three stages. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak's hard-line predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, carried out  
the first phase, but then suspended the accord, saying the 
Palestinians did not do enough to fight terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak hopes to skip over the last pullback because he fears it  
will isolate several Jewish settlements and expose them to attack 
by Palestinian militants. However, Barak has also said he would 
carry out Wye in full if the Palestinians rejected his idea. 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has repeatedly turned down Barak's 
proposal, insisting on a full implementation of the accord.

<HEADLINE> Liberians in US Lose Special Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Nearly 10 years ago, Torli Krua escaped from a  
group of machete-wielding warlords who hunted him down in the 
middle of the night because he was from a rival tribe. 
</P>
<P>
	But soon he may be forced to confront the assailants again.  
</P>
<P>
	After war erupted in the West African nation of Liberia in 1989,  
Liberians were granted temporary permission to live and work in the 
United States until their homeland settled down. 
</P>
<P>
	The special immigration status was extended year after year, and  
many Liberians were able to begin new lives here. But the State 
Department now says Liberia is stable and has recommended that the 
1,000 to 1,500 Liberians granted the special status return home by 
Sept. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Krua and others are pleading for permission to remain, saying  
Liberia is still too dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (Liberian) government has not shown it will tolerate  
dissent,'' said Krua, 48, who has been living in Boston. ``Here, I 
go to bed freely. I speak freely. If I go back, I don't know if I 
will be able to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department and the State Department say that while  
Liberia continues to struggle from the effects of the civil war, 
Liberians here should be safe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Temporary Protected Status allows foreigners to stay in the  
United States if their home countries suffer political violence or 
natural disasters. Liberians whose temporary protected status 
expires have the right to apply for political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberia's civil war ravaged the country between 1989 and 1996,  
leaving an estimated 200,000 people dead. While the country is 
largely at peace, much of it is still without electricity, passable 
roads, and supplies remain short. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberia's political system is riddled by tribal division. A  
person's tribe often makes or breaks their position in society. 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics of Liberia's president, Charles Taylor, say the  
former warlord has rewarded supporters and punishes those who are 
not obedient. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who had homes, property and skills fled because they  
had to,'' said Rev. Henry James, a Liberian who lives permanently 
in Stoughton. ``If some of these Liberians go back, they will be 
hunted because of who they are and their tribal backgrounds.''

<HEADLINE> Survey: Age Doesn't Deter Sex Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sex isn't just for the young. It's also for  
the young at heart, according to a survey that finds many older 
Americans continue to have active sex lives and find their partners 
attractive as they age. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey was conducted by the AARP, the nation's largest  
organization of older adults, for the September-October issue of 
its ``Modern Maturity'' magazine, devoted to the topic: ``Great 
sex: What's age got to do with it?'' The racy issue is part of 
AARP's campaign to attract aging baby boomers -- who led the 1960s 
sexual revolution -- as members. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest myth out there of all is the myth that old people  
don't have sex or aren't interested in sex -- that basically after a 
certain age you're supposed to go to Florida, play golf and wait 
for Ed McMahon to knock on the door and not to think or even do 
sex,'' said the magazine's editor, Hugh Delehanty. ``We all know 
this is patently absurd and we wanted to look and see what the 
truth was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey by the American Association of Retired Persons found  
that more than six in 10 men between the ages of 45 and 59 and a 
similar percentage of women in middle age report having sex at 
least once a week. One in four people over age 75 reported similar 
frequency. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline in sexual activity does not seem to be caused by a  
lack of physical attraction between couples as they age, the survey 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	About 59 percent of men between the ages of 45 and 74 say the  
phrase ``physically attractive'' strongly applies to their partner, 
while 62 percent of those over age 75 agree. About half of women in 
both middle and old age said physical attraction to their partner 
was strong. 
</P>
<P>
	What does seem to make the difference is lack of partners, who  
may be lost to death or divorce. While eight in 10 people aged 45 
to 59 have sexual partners, only 58 percent of men and 21 percent 
of women aged 75 and older do. 
</P>
<P>
	However, changing morals may make this less of a constraint for  
the baby boomers than it is for their parents. While 66 percent of 
women age 75 and older think that people should not have sexual 
relationships if they are not married, only 36 percent of women 
aged 45 to 59 do. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are left to speculate how sexual behaviors and attitudes of  
those mid-life adults that we queried, who came of age during the 
sexual and gender revolutions of the 1960s, how their attitudes and 
behaviors will change as they age,'' said AARP's director of 
research, Constance Swank. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining health is the other thing holding older people back in  
the bedroom. More than half of men and a third of women said better 
health for themselves or their partners would improve their sex 
lives. Other changes that people said would help included less 
stress and more free time. 
</P>
<P>
	One in four men acknowledged being completely or moderately  
impotent, although despite the publicity of new treatments such as 
the drug Viagra, only 41 percent of them said they had sought 
medical help. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey of 1,384 adults age 45 and older was conducted by  
mail during March. The margin of error is plus or minus 2.6 
percentage points.

<HEADLINE>  Bills' Thomas Might Start Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREDONIA, N.Y. (AP) -- Thurman Thomas reluctantly accepted his  
role as a backup behind Antowain Smith last season. A groin injury 
could sideline Smith and force Thomas -- who has 11,786 career yards 
-- back into the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas would take the heat for a while, the 12-year veteran said  
Wednesday. But he doesn't want to make it a permanent thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it does come to me being a full-time starter, and having to  
play 60 to 70 plays a game, I'm willing to do that early in the 
season,'' Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	For 10 years, Thomas, who occupies a prominent place in the  
hearts of Buffalo fans and 12 pages in the Bills' media guide, took 
a back seat to nobody. Ninth in rushing in NFL history, Thomas 
trails only Emmitt Smith among active backs now that Thomas' old 
college teammate, Barry Sanders, has retired. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also one of three Bills, along with Bruce Smith and Andre  
Reed, still around who played in the team's four straight Super 
Bowl losses of the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	It was understandable that he wasn't crazy at first about  
slipping into the shadows last year behind Smith, the top draft 
pick in 1997. While the Bills still believed Thomas had more 
100-yard games in him -- he has 52 -- they gave Smith the starting 
job because he was younger, bigger and faster. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, 33, settled in as a situational back and has grown fond  
of actually being able to walk on Monday mornings after games. 
That's why he'll agree to go back to being a starter only in a 
pinch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like my role that I'm in,'' Thomas said. ``I've gotten to  
the point now where I'm feeling good after ball games and not all 
beat up to where I'm not practicing well until Thursday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Wade Phillips listed Thomas and Smith as co-starters on  
the depth chart but that was seen as a ploy to prod Smith, who 
averaged just 3.8 yards per carry last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, also sparked by the Bills' courting of troubled running  
back Lawrence Phillips, showed up at camp 12 pounds lighter and 
running well. The road seemed to smooth out for Smith when Phillips 
ended up in San Francisco, but Smith aggravated an old groin injury 
and hasn't practiced at full speed since Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas is an obvious candidate to step in, however reluctant he  
might be. But the Bills play their first exhibition game Aug. 14, 
so there's still time for Smith to heal and for Thomas to retain 
his reduced role. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now it's too early to tell what's going to happen,''  
said Thomas, who shares the backfield in the two-back set with 
All-Pro fullback Sam Gash, second-year reserve Jonathan Linton and 
rookie fullback Shawn Bryson from Tennessee, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now Jonathan and I are just waiting for Antowain to get  
healthy,'' Thomas said. ``We wouldn't want this injury keeping him 
out for a long time. But the talent and competition is still 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bills' concern over Smith's condition has ranged from  
borderline panic to relaxed optimism. Wade Phillips used the word 
``chronic'' in describing the injury earlier in the week, but 
Wednesday said he was expecting Smith back. He couldn't say when. 
</P>
<P>
	``You go to the alternatives if he's not there,'' Phillips said.  
``We know what we would do in those situations, but those 
situations haven't come up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bills hope they have enough depth to handle any situation.  
</P>
<P>
	``If it does carry on into the regular season, I would probably  
be the starter and Jonathan (Linton) probably would come in like I 
did with Antowain,'' Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas says he's not thinking about retirement, despite Sanders  
calling it quits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been on winning football teams; he's always been  
on losing football teams,'' Thomas said. ``It's easier for me to 
stay here and not think about retirement.''

	He's also one of three Bills, along with Bruce Smith and Andre  
Reed, still around who played in the team's four straight Super 
Bowl losses of the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	It was understandable that he wasn't crazy at first about  
slipping into the shadows last year behind Smith, the top draft 
pick in 1997. While the Bills still believed Thomas had more 
100-yard games in him -- he has 52 -- they gave Smith the starting 
job because he was younger, bigger and faster. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, 33, settled in as a situational back and has grown fond  
of actually being able to walk on Monday mornings after games. 
That's why he'll agree to go back to being a starter only in a 
pinch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like my role that I'm in,'' Thomas said. ``I've gotten to  
the point now where I'm feeling good after ball games and not all 
beat up to where I'm not practicing well until Thursday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Wade Phillips listed Thomas and Smith as co-starters on  
the depth chart but that was seen as a ploy to prod Smith, who 
averaged just 3.8 yards per carry last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, also sparked by the Bills' courting of troubled running  
back Lawrence Phillips, showed up at camp 12 pounds lighter and 
running well. The road seemed to smooth out for Smith when Phillips 
ended up in San Francisco, but Smith aggravated an old groin injury 
and hasn't practiced at full speed since Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas is an obvious candidate to step in, however reluctant he  
might be. But the Bills play their first exhibition game Aug. 14, 
so there's still time for Smith to heal and for Thomas to retain 
his reduced role. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now it's too early to tell what's going to happen,''  
said Thomas, who shares the backfield in the two-back set with 
All-Pro fullback Sam Gash, second-year reserve Jonathan Linton and 
rookie fullback Shawn Bryson from Tennessee, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now Jonathan and I are just waiting for Antowain to get  
healthy,'' Thomas said. ``We wouldn't want this injury keeping him 
out for a long time. But the talent and competition is still 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bills' concern over Smith's condition has ranged from  
borderline panic to relaxed optimism. Wade Phillips used the word 
``chronic'' in describing the injury earlier in the week, but 
Wednesday said he was expecting Smith back. He couldn't say when. 
</P>
<P>
	``You go to the alternatives if he's not there,'' Phillips said.  
``We know what we would do in those situations, but those 
situations haven't come up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bills hope they have enough depth to handle any situation.  
</P>
<P>
	``If it does carry on into the regular season, I would probably  
be the starter and Jonathan (Linton) probably would come in like I 
did with Antowain,'' Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas says he's not thinking about retirement, despite Sanders  
calling it quits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been on winning football teams; he's always been  
on losing football teams,'' Thomas said. ``It's easier for me to 
stay here and not think about retirement.''

<HEADLINE> AP Corrects Twins Ballpark Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- In an Aug. 3 story about a proposal to  
sell the Minnesota Twins to new owners and move the team to a new 
stadium in St. Paul, The Associated Press erroneously reported that 
major league baseball had approved both the sale and the move. 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioner has given the current owners permission to seek  
a St. Paul buyer. But any sale would have to be approved by 
three-fourths of American League teams and a majority of National 
League teams, and no vote has occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	The Twins don't need approval to move to St. Paul, which  
baseball already considers part of the team's territory.

<HEADLINE> Rock Beat: Johnnie Johnson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Johnnie B. Goode is back, and he's bad.  
</P>
<P>
	While most rock stars' heyday is in their youth, blues and  
boogie pianist Johnnie Johnson is approaching his 75th birthday and 
his popularity is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	He's no longer just known as the Chuck Berry sideman who  
inspired Berry's famous ``Johnny B. Goode.'' Nearly half a century 
after he first took the stage, Johnson's stepping out from Berry's 
shadow and gaining acclaim as a solo blues star. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's adopted hometown of St. Louis recently honored him  
with a weeklong celebration, including a jazz festival and birthday 
party. And his ``Father of Rock 'n' Roll: The Johnnie 'B. Goode' 
Johnson Story,'' was recently published. 
</P>
<P>
	It took years and some crusading by modern rock musicians to  
push Johnson into the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	His biggest break came in 1987 during the compilation of a Chuck  
Berry documentary called ``Hail, Hail Rock 'n' Roll.'' During the 
filming, Johnson met Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones who urged 
Johnson to pursue his solo career. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, Johnson released his first solo album,  
``Bluehand Johnnie.'' The albums ``Johnnie B. Bad'' and ``Johnnie 
Be Back'' followed. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came a push from Houston businessman George Turek to get  
Johnson into Cleveland's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Turek, CEO of 
the physicians management service company MES Group, had hired 
Johnson to play at his wedding and quickly became a fan. 
</P>
<P>
	Turek even ran an advertisement in Billboard magazine featuring  
a letter to the hall-of-fame nominating committee to persuade them 
of Johnson's talent and influence. It was signed by other 
inductees, including Bo Diddley, John Lee Hooker, Little Richard 
and Etta James. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Hall of Fame said it didn't have a category in which to  
fit Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Inductees are nominated for work done in their own name or with  
a group. Even though Johnson collaborated with Berry on songs, the 
credit is given to Berry. Johnson's solo albums have only been 
released in the last decade, so it's too early for him to be 
nominated individually. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson isn't discouraged.  
</P>
<P>
	With Turek's help, ``the wheels have been going forward. I'm  
getting more exposure,'' Johnson said in a recent interview. ``Now, 
with the book, that'll be icing on the cake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was born in West Virginia and began playing the piano  
when he was 5 years old. He joined his first band, Blue Rhythm 
Swingsters, when he was 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson served in World War II and came to the St. Louis area  
after playing for three years in Chicago with top blues players. In 
1952, the young musician was in East St. Louis when a member of his 
band fell ill before a New Year's Eve gig. The replacement he hired 
was guitarist Chuck Berry. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest is musical history.  
</P>
<P>
	The duo wrote rock 'n' roll classics like ``Mabelline'' and  
``Roll Over, Beethoven.'' Johnson composed the music on piano, 
Berry converted it to guitar and wrote the lyrics. They blended 
blues, boogie and country to form the genre that helped shape rock 
music in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	``When rock 'n' roll came in strong, it was really the guitar  
players that brought it in -- Chuck and Elvis Presley,'' Johnson 
said. Being the sideman to Berry never bothered him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Today Johnson has tapped into a surge in the popularity of the  
blues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, it seems like blues and jazz are the outstanding  
types of music,'' Johnson said. ``I've met quite a few young 
musicians. All these kids who are starting to play now are focusing 
on learning the blues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's latest CD, due out in a couple of months, will be his  
seventh. Atlantic Records also is lining up artists for a special 
tribute album in Johnson's honor. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as I can lift a hand to play, I'll be playing,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Doing Business Online Said Cheaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- A new study being released today  
predicts that corporations around the world will save up to $1.25 
trillion -- close to France's entire gross domestic product -- by 
doing business over the Internet by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Those savings range from reducing the amount of people it takes  
to process a sales request to making it easier and less expensive 
to order office supplies online. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything we do here is Internet business,'' said Cisco  
Systems executive vice president Don Listwin. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco saved $250 million last year distributing software to its  
business customers over the Internet. U.S. banks saved $18 billion 
with online transactions. General Electric has lowered supplier 
costs by using online auctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco's customers are all companies that want to do business  
online. But Cisco also practices what it sells, conducting its own 
in-house business online as well. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Cisco employees sign up for benefits online. Eighty  
percent of technical inquiries from customers are handled online. 
The company saved $8 million last year by recruiting and accepting 
job applications online. 
</P>
<P>
	Listwin said the paperless transactions that save money for  
Cisco and its customers are easily transferable to most other 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have anything that's unique, that the market can't  
generally get at,'' he said. ``What's unique is that our corporate 
culture accepts that we are conducting business online.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Brown, director of marketing for Inktomi Corp., which  
creates search engines for Internet companies such as Yahoo! Inc., 
said the company Web site saves them money by allowing potential 
customers to review marketing information online. 
</P>
<P>
	``People championing our products at their company are armed  
with white papers, diagrams and demos they can show their 
management team,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet analysts at Giga Information Group, which conducted the  
survey, say that just as the telephone affected more than 
communications and jet airplanes affected more than travel, the 
Internet will continue to drive significant changes in the way 
industrialized nations do business. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet is more than just a new way to sell products and  
services, it's a way to efficiently run a business, resulting in 
significant cost savings that add to an organization's bottom 
line,'' said Andrew Bartels, a Giga vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Bartels said that for the most part, the savings are business to  
business, on internal processes, finances, procurement or human 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
	Money that companies save from changing their business ways is  
often reinvested internally, helping pay for the Internet 
programmers and establish the infrastructure that allows the 
companies to conduct e-commerce effectively. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases the savings are trickling down to consumers who  
can find some lower prices online, Bartels said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Internet sales are just the tip of the iceberg of economic  
value that companies can derive from e-commerce,'' he added. 
``Companies should consider e-commerce as more than a way to sell 
products or services, they should focus at least as much attention 
on the business efficiencies and cost-savings opportunities 
presented by the Internet and related technologies.''

<HEADLINE> New Nugget Mercer a No-Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- One day after being acquired from the Boston  
Celtics, along with Popeye Jones and Dwayne Schintzius, Ron Mercer 
was a no-show Wednesday for a news conference with his new 
employers, the Denver Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ron Mercer will not be here and we have learned that somebody  
told Mercer in Boston yesterday that we had already agreed to 
extend his contract,'' Denver general manager Dan Issel said. ``We 
had no prior conversations with Ron or his agent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mercer, who will be in the final year of a contract that expires  
at the end of next season, reportedly said Tuesday that he would 
not come to Denver until a contract extension was offered. 
</P>
<P>
	A Boston Globe story said the Nuggets were prepared to offer the  
player a six-year extension. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he was disappointed and I think that is why he is not  
here,'' Issel said. ``He was under the impression there was going 
to be an extension when he got here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Issel denied making such an offer and said there won't be one.  
</P>
<P>
	``We will wait until the end of next year and if he has a great  
year, it is going to cost us more money,'' Issel said. ``If 
somebody else comes in and signs him away from us, then that is one 
of the chances we take. We are aren't going to do an extension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Issel said he wasn't worried that Mercer wouldn't show up. He  
said he felt better after talking with him earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is our understanding that he will be in here to take his  
physical and the trade will be consummated,'' Issel said. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for Mercer and the others, the Nuggets agreed to  
trade Danny Fortson, Eric Washington, Eric Williams and a future 
first-round draft choice to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Issel said the Mercer case reminded him of what the Sacramento  
Kings went through a year ago after obtaining Chris Webber from the 
Washington Wizards. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were questions all summer long: Was he going to show up,  
was he going to play with Sacramento?'' Issel said. ``And he wound 
up being second team all-NBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Celtics began shopping the 6-foot-7 Mercer last month after  
discovering how far apart they were on his new contract demands. 
Mercer, who averaged a career-high 17 points for Boston last 
season, can be a free agent next year, and indicated he wouldn't 
re-sign with Boston if he wasn't given an extension this summer.

<HEADLINE> Parents Arrested in Prayer Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Murder charges have been filed against the  
parents of an 8-year-old girl whose body was found in her family's 
Buddhist prayer room near a note written in blood praying for 
``compassion, love and kindness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tung Tuong, 42, and Minh Tuong, 30, were arrested Tuesday on  
murder and child abuse charges in the death of Christine Tuong. 
They each were being held on $1 million bond. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple has been under investigation since the girl's  
battered body was discovered May 15. Her parents waited nearly 14 
hours to report her death. 
</P>
<P>
	A preliminary autopsy report said the girl was hit with a belt  
more than 17 times, leaving injuries that match belt buckles found 
in the family's home. ``The injuries were so severe that Christine 
was not even able to speak or walk under her own power,'' the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple told police the girl came home the night she died  
with bruises after playing in a vacant lot near their home. They 
said they tried to heal her with a Buddhist ritual that involved 
prayer and oils that were rubbed on her body. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tuongs' four other young children, including a boy born in  
June, are in the custody of the state's Child Protective Services 
agency. Police said the family had been investigated at least four 
times since 1995 after school nurses reported seeing bruises for 
which the explanations seemed far-fetched.

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Makes Comeback in Minors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Before Darryl Strawberry headed back to  
the minors he got a pointed message from Yankees owner George 
Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me, `Don't screw up again,''' Strawberry said. ``I  
said, `I won't.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, attempting to come back from his latest drug  
suspension -- while still recovering from colon cancer surgery -- has 
been given another chance by Yankees management to return to The 
Bronx if he can turn his life around. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in the starting lineup for Triple-A Columbus Wednesday  
night, playing for the first time since learning he had colon 
cancer last Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of fans along the third baseline gave Strawberry a  
standing ovation when he left on the on-deck circle for his first 
at-bat in the second inning. They cheered even louder when he 
singled sharply to center on Jose Bautista's second pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	A smattering of boos was also heard. Columbus, after all, is  
home to many Cleveland Indians fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry went 2-for-4, but failed to come through with the  
game on the line in the ninth. He got jammed and popped out to 
third to end it with the tying run on second as the Clippers lost 
3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a matter of time, a matter of getting back,''  
Strawberry said. ``You know that's the first time I've faced game 
situation pitches. All I did down in Tampa was just hit, run and 
shag balls. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be in a live situation and seeing breaking balls, I felt a  
little rusty. ... You need to get at least 15 to 20 at-bats before 
you really start feeling good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry singled to right in the fifth and stole second  
despite a poor jump when the throw from Norfolk catcher Mandy 
Romero skipped into center field. 
</P>
<P>
	He looked overmatched in the fourth when Bautista blew strike  
three past him. He walked on four pitches in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry said he was overanxious at the plate in the ninth.  
</P>
<P>
	``It could have ended better than it did,'' he said. ``In a  
situation like that I've got a right-hand hitter on deck and I've 
got to be a lot smarter than that and not chase bad pitches. I 
chased two bad pitches trying to probably do too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, Strawberry said he doesn't plan to let this  
opportunity slip by, admitting this will be his final comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll tell you right now, if I have to go through this again,  
I'll never return to baseball. ... The most important thing is that 
I care about me instead of putting pressure on myself to prove 
myself,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the most important thing for right now is to deal with  
my addiction and recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry was suspended 120 days by commissioner Bud Selig  
after his arrest on solicitation and drug charges April 14. Selig 
reduced the suspension by one week on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry said he was going through a tough time when he was  
arrested, depressed about not making the Yankees' Opening Day 
roster, and he had stopped going to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he became overwhelmed with trying to get in shape to  
play baseball, finish up six months of chemotherapy and stay on top 
of his rehab. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone that suffers through cancer and has to take  
chemotherapy for six months, somewhere down the line there's going 
to be a wall hit,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really wish I would have paid more attention to my health  
than concerning myself with getting back on the baseball field. My 
life is more important than getting back on the baseball field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel bad that I let down first of all my wife and my two  
children, but also myself and Mr. Steinbrenner and the entire New 
York Yankees,'' Strawberry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clippers manager Trey Hillman had Strawberry batting cleanup at  
designated hitter, but said he could play left field Thursday 
depending on how he feels. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to do something that will set him back two or  
three days,'' Hillman said. ``He hasn't done this since April. 
There's going to be a little doubt how his body will recover. We're 
not sure.''	   Where Strawberry plays once he gets back to New York remains 
undecided. An injured left knee will make it tough for him to play 
left field regularly, and Chili Davis is firmly entrenched at DH. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's no doubt the Yankees could use his bat. Strawberry  
hit 24 homers in 295 at-bats last year before being diagnosed with 
colon cancer. The Yankees' current left-field platoon of Shane 
Spencer, Ricky Ledee and Chad Curtis has 14 homers in 384 at-bats 
heading into Wednesday's game with Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry said he doesn't have a timetable for returning to New  
York and won't demand playing time from manager Joe Torre. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not looking to go up there to say I'm the left fielder and  
I should play,'' he said. ``If I have to go sit on the bench, 
that's what I have to do. If I don't get back there this year, I 
just don't get back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry previously played with Columbus in 1995 after signing  
as a free agent, in 1996 after he left the St. Paul Saints of the 
Northern League, and on an injury rehabilitation in 1997.

<HEADLINE> TV Helicopter Spots Women Adrift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Three people whose boat sank during a thunderstorm  
spent a night floating in the Atlantic Ocean before they were 
spotted by a passing boater and a television news helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicky Scanlon, Daniel Hernandez and Anna Goodwyn, who were all  
wearing life jackets, suffered dehydration, jellyfish stings and 
nasty sunburns. But they were treated and released from a hospital 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm finished with the water for a while,'' Ms. Goodwyn said.  
``I don't think I'm going fishing anymore, unless it's in a little 
pond about 3 feet deep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three were caught in a thunderstorm about 3:30 p.m. Monday  
while out in a 15-foot boat. It went down off Elliott Key, about 20 
miles southeast of Miami, in or near Biscayne National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``The waves come into your mouth so strong that you can't  
breathe,'' Ms. Goodwyn said as she was brought ashore and airlifted 
to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	After they floated together through the night, Hernandez said he  
decided to try swimming 11 miles back to shore for help. He was 
rescued by a boater about 9:30 a.m. Tuesday, and the Coast Guard 
asked news helicopters to watch for the missing women. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Goodwyn and her daughter, tied together and bobbing around a  
channel marker miles offshore, were located by the crew of 
WTVJ-TV's chopper around 11:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami station aired live shots of the women bobbing in the  
water, Ms. Scanlon crying with relief and waving at the helicopter.

<HEADLINE> Mercer, Anderson in NBA Trades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Boston Celtics didn't want to meet Ron Mercer's asking  
price, so they shipped him to Denver. The Orlando Magic wanted to 
get younger, so they sent Nick Anderson to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	Two trades involving a total of eight players highlighted the  
offseason action in the NBA on Tuesday, when several free agents 
deciding to remain with their former teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Bo Outlaw re-signed with Orlando, Nick Van Exel stayed in Denver  
and Derek Fisher landed a seven-year contract from the Lakers, who 
also were courting Charles Oakley with a recruiting pitch straight 
out of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want him so bad that Magic Johnson offered to let Oakley  
wear No. 32 if it would get the deal done,'' said Oakley's agent, 
Billy Diamond. ``I don't see us doing anything in the near 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mercer was traded from the Celtics to the Nuggets in a  
six-player deal that also sent Popeye Jones and Dwayne Schintzius 
to Denver for Danny Fortson, Eric Washington, Eric Williams and a 
first-round draft choice in one of the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson went to the Kings for guard Tariq Abdul-Wahid and a  
future No. 1 pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortson, a 6-foot-7 forward who ranked fourth in the NBA in  
rebounding last season, is going into the final season of his 
three-year rookie contract -- just like Mercer. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston did not want to meet Mercer's asking price, which was  
believed to be in excess of $50 million for a six-year extension. 
Mercer can be a free agent next year, and indicated he wouldn't 
re-sign with Boston if he wasn't given an extension this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had no desire to trade Ron Mercer,'' coach Rick Pitino  
said. ``I could not even come close to the numbers Ron Mercer 
wanted as a basketball player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, 31, who has averaged 15.4 points and 5.3 rebounds in  
10 NBA seasons, was the first draft pick of the expansion Magic in 
1989. He was entering the third season of a four-year contract 
that, with incentives, could pay him more than $24 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sacramento is the talk of the league right now,'' Anderson  
said. ``Flash, run and gun, having a lot of fun -- that's what I 
like, to keep the fun in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Wahad, a 24-year-old shooting guard, has played two  
seasons with the Kings, who made him the 11th pick in the 1997 
draft. As a starter with the Kings last season, Abdul-Wahad 
averaged 9.3 points and 3.8 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Outlaw, Orlando's wiry 6-foot-8 forward, re-signed with the  
Magic for one year and $2 million. He said he turned down more 
lucrative offers elsewhere to remain in Orlando. Outlaw will have 
full Larry Bird rights next summer, meaning the Magic will be able 
to exceed the salary cap to re-sign him again. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Exel re-signed in Denver for a deal believed to be worth  
over $70 million for seven years, $50 million of which is 
guaranteed. The Nuggets also signed free agent forward George 
McCloud, who played in Phoenix last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher, who split time with Derek Harper at point guard last  
season for the Lakers, signed a seven-year contract worth about $24 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakley got the royal treatment from the Los Angeles Lakers --  
lunch with Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant and a tour of the new 
arena from Jerry West. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakley is demanding $8.5 million annually for three years from  
the Toronto Raptors, who have offered $5.5 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Contrary to what people in Toronto are saying, the Raptors  
haven't increased their offer,'' said Oakley's agent, Diamond, who 
accompanied the veteran power forward during his afternoon of 
courtship with the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakley is being courted by several teams seeking to add an  
experienced big body along the front line. He has been in Los 
Angeles since last weekend, attending Magic Johnson's charity game 
and playing golf with Lakers representatives 
</P>
<P>
	So eager are the Lakers to convince Oakley to sign that O'Neal  
and Bryant, not the best of friends during their three seasons 
together in Los Angeles, agreed to have lunch together with Oakley 
and Diamond.	   Oakley later joined West and general manager Mitch Kupchak for a 
tour of the team's new practice facility and the Staples center, 
which will replace the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	``The meeting was best described as informative. Charles has  
some pointed questions about the chemistry of the team,'' Diamond 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Diamond also said the Hawks, Heat and Knicks remain interested  
in Oakley. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortson, who plays center and power forward, averaged 11.0  
points and 11.6 rebounds per game last year. His playing time 
increased considerably after rookie Raef LaFrentz went down early 
in the season with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercer, the sixth pick overall in the 1997 draft, averaged 17  
points last season. The 6-foot-7, 210-pound Mercer was an NBA 
All-Rookie Team selection in 1997-98 when he averaged 15.3 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal sends Williams back to the city where he played the  
first two years of his career. Williams averaged 15 points for the 
Celtics in 1996-1997. Last year in Denver, Williams averaged 7.3 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is entering the third year of a four-year, $30 million  
contract. Denver agreed to pay $3 million of Williams' contract 
this year, the maximum percentage allowed by the league. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets waived center Rony Seikaly, who played just 18 games in  
1 1/2 seasons with New Jersey because of injuries. New Jersey still 
owes Seikaly $4.5 million for the final season of his contract. The 
34-year-old was hampered by ankle and foot injuries during the 1999 
season.

<HEADLINE> Students Wear Patches for Columbine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- It is designed to promote harmony among high  
school cliques, the ones whose divisions were exposed so painfully 
in the Columbine High School shooting that left 15 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a patch, a tiny black-and-white one that says simply:  
``Respect.'' It will be available to Colorado high school students 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt compelled to come up with a way to still have a link  
with that tragedy but move forward,'' said Bill Reader, associate 
commissioner of the Colorado High School Activities Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Dylan Klebold, 17, and Eric Harris, 18, killed 12 students, a  
teacher and themselves in the April 20 rampage. Twenty-three 
students were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were members of the Trench Coat Mafia, a group of  
students who shared a predilection for dark ``Goth'' culture and, 
according to diary entries, considered themselves outcasts in the 
school pecking order. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses have said the young gunmen singled out those who  
infuriated them the most -- popular athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Junior Aaron Cohn, 16, who was in the school library when the  
killers walked in and shot several people, believes he survived 
because a classmate jumped on his back and covered the baseball 
slogan on his shirt. He said he would probably wear one of the 
patches on his baseball uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means people trying to unite with the whole,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The activities association, the high school governing body in  
the state, plans to send schools more than 200,000 of the 1-by-2 
inch patches later this month, to be worn voluntarily by students 
at sports, music, speech and student council activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The patches, white with black lettering, will be free.  
</P>
<P>
	Association staffers came up with the idea of the patch after  
sports officials asked them to develop a way to honor Columbine and 
the victims.

<HEADLINE> Lions Sign QB Hollas, Let Go Powlus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIVERSITY CENTER, Mich. (AP) -- The Detroit Lions released  
quarterback Ron Powlus on Wednesday to make room for newcomer 
Donald Hollas, a former quarterack for the Oakland Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
	Powlus joined the Lions roughly six months ago as a free agent  
but was let go in a move Lions coach Bobby Ross called ``a tough 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to take a good look at Powlus,'' Ross said at the  
Lions' camp at Saginaw Valley State. ``I don't want five QB's out 
here. I wanted four, so we had to make that decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that we have Don Hollas in, he has to do a lot of catching  
up,'' Ross said of the newcomer who spent his first day in 
Detroit's camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions corps of quarterbacks also includes starter Charlie  
Batch, Gus Frerotte and Corey Sauter. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Raiders last season, Hollas completed 135 of 260 passes  
for 1,754 yards. He threw 10 touchdowns and 16 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Powlus, who has never thrown an NFL regular-season pass, tossed  
for 121 yards in two preseason games for the relocated Tennessee 
franchise last year. During the final two weeks of last season, he 
was with the St. Louis Rams' practice squad.

<HEADLINE> Judge: No Bias in Clinton Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Political considerations had nothing to do  
with the assigning of two cases involving President Clinton's 
friends to Clinton-appointed judges, the chief judge of the U.S. 
District Court said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, who personally assigned the two  
cases to judges named by Clinton, said court rules allow chief 
judges to specially assign complex or drawn-out cases to judges 
under their command and that it was her responsibility to ``move 
the docket as expeditiously as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Politics was not and is never a factor in our case  
assignments,'' Johnson said in a letter to the editor published in 
The Washington Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was responding to an Aug. 1 Associated Press story  
published in the paper that said she bypassed the traditional 
random assignment method and sent two criminal cases against 
presidential friends Webster Hubbell and Charlie Trie to judges 
appointed by Clinton who are friendly with key players in the 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson assigned the Trie case to Judge Paul L. Friedman and  
sent the Hubbell case to Judge James Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
	Random assignment is used in almost all cases.  
</P>
<P>
	The story quoted court officials and judges, speaking on  
condition of anonymity, as saying that Johnson's decision to assign 
the cases caused several judges to be concerned about an appearance 
of a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges said they did not believe either Friedman or  
Robertson were improperly influenced. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, Friedman and Robertson had all declined repeated AP  
requests for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	In her letter, Johnson said the assignment method enables ``our  
court to handle expeditiously high-profile criminal cases with 
unique demands on judicial resources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several judges who attended a meeting Johnson called on Monday  
to discuss the matter said she told colleagues that several judges 
had heavy workloads at the time of the Trie and Hubbell cases and 
that was a factor in assigning the cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Criminal cases arising from Watergate and the Iran-Contra affair  
were handled through special assignment, she noted in the meeting 
and in her letter to the editor. 
</P>
<P>
	Those assignments, however, were to some of the most experienced  
judges in the courthouse at the time and not to recent appointees, 
AP reported this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson dismissed the tax case against Hubbell, who eventually  
pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor when an appeals court reinstated 
the case. Robertson was later chosen, at random, to handle a felony 
case against Hubbell, charging him with lying to federal 
regulators. Robertson threw out the central felony count in that 
case, but again an appeals court reversed him, and Hubbell 
eventually pleaded guilty to one felony count. 
</P>
<P>
	Friedman tossed out various charges against Trie. After one of  
Friedman's rulings was overturned on appeal, Trie agreed to plead 
guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson also addressed the article's assertions that Robertson  
and Friedman had longtime friendships with key players in the cases 
they got. 
</P>
<P>
	``A judge's prior affiliations or acquaintances, alone, do not  
require recusal or disqualification,'' Johnson wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Lots of judges in the U.S. District Court know lawyers and  
public officials in Washington, she noted. If they were required to 
be disqualified from cases because ``of these innocuous 
connections, it would wreak havoc on case scheduling,'' Johnson 
said.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Killer Can Stand Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- A man who received As and Bs in college  
after originally being declared incompetent to stand trial in his 
girlfriend's slaying has now been deemed mentally fit. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge George Thim declared Tuesday that Kenneth  
Curtis' self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head should not excuse 
him from facing charges in the shooting of Donna Kalson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is quite clear to this court that Kenneth Curtis has  
purposely exaggerated his symptoms in an effort to influence the 
outcome of this criminal prosecution,'' Thim wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say Curtis, now 33, fatally shot Ms. Kalson on Oct. 30,  
1987, then turned the gun on himself. After several hearings in the 
late 1980s, courts concluded that the injury left Curtis so 
impaired that he was incompetent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
	But 10 years after his release, police discovered Curtis had  
been taking classes at several colleges. He earned a B-plus average 
from 1992 to 1995, then enrolled in the pre-med psychiatry program 
at Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven. 
</P>
<P>
	He was rearrested in November 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer, Salvatore C. DePiano, had argued his client, who  
uses a wheelchair and still has the bullet lodged in his brain, 
wasn't competent to understand the charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
	During his appearances in court, Curtis kept his chin on his  
chest, seemingly oblivious to everything going on around him. The 
image was in stark contrast to videotaped evidence, showing Curtis 
attending classes, and talking about his plans for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have said he's been exaggerating, and I've said it from Day  
One,'' said Barbara Kalson, the victim's mother. ``He's a great 
actor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DePiano did not return a phone message seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Factory Orders Rise in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Orders to American factories for manufactured  
goods posted a bigger-than-expected increase in June, led by higher 
demand for autos and electronic equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported today that factory orders rose  
0.7 percent, following a 1 percent increase in May, a little less 
than the government previously estimated. Many analysts were 
expecting a 0.4 percent rise in overall factory orders in June. 
</P>
<P>
	June's overall performance marked the 10th increase in the last  
13 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The transportation sector helped bolster June's overall  
performance with a 2.3 percent increase. A rise in orders for autos 
and car parts more than offset a decrease in orders for airplane 
and aircraft parts. In May, transportation posted a hefty, 9.9 
percent gain. 
</P>
<P>
	However, excluding the volatile transportation category, factory  
orders would have risen a solid 0.5 percent in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for electronic and other electrical equipment, the  
category that includes household appliances and communications 
equipment, rose 2.4 percent in June, following a drop of 0.9 
percent in May. 
</P>
<P>
	June's overall gain in factory orders came despite a steep, 5.1  
percent decrease in orders for industrial machinery and equipment, 
the sector that includes computers. It was the second straight 
monthly decline. In May, orders for industrial machinery fell 4.5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's report offered some positive signs for the steel  
industry. Orders for primary metals, the category that includes 
steel, rose 0.4 percent in June, following gains in April and May. 
The steel industry has been one of the hardest hit by the Asian 
crisis, suffering from a flood of cheaper imported steel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, orders for durable goods -- items expected to last at  
least three years -- also went up in June, rising 0.4 percent. And, 
orders for nondurable goods, such as food and fuel also increased, 
posting a 1.2 percent gain. 
</P>
<P>
	The solid showing in overall factory orders in June appears to  
be good news for the U.S. manufacturing sector, which is recovering 
from the global economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturing has been the hardest-hit sector from the turmoil,  
suffering from dampened overseas demand for U.S. goods and 
competition from a flood of cheaper imports. Since March 1998, 
488,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, a report from the National Association of Purchasing  
Management said the U.S. manufacturing sector grew in July for the 
sixth straight month, but not as strongly as most analysts 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets have been rattled over concerns that the  
Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates on June 30, may raise 
them again, possibly as early as this month.

<HEADLINE> Embassies Vulnerable To Car Bombs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, worried about  
repeat attacks a year after bombs tore through two U.S. embassies 
in Africa, has built walls, blocked out windows, closed streets and 
hired 4,000 new guards to protect American outposts around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	After spending $1.5 billion beefing up security at ``every  
single post,'' diplomats are safer, State Department officials 
insisted Wednesday. But they acknowledged that the vast majority of 
embassies and consulates remain vulnerable to terrorist car bombs 
like those that killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, last 
Aug. 7 in Kenya and Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will fight terrorism every day,'' declared Michael Sheehan,  
U.S. counterterrorism coordinator, speaking at the newly fortified 
State Department where ceremonies Saturday will honor the dead and 
the more than 5,000 injured in the Africa bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've made improvements at every single post around the  
world,'' said Peter Bergin, director of the diplomatic security 
service. The State Department itself is ringed by concrete and 
steel barriers, with circular driveways no longer used. The street 
on one side is closed to non-government traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite tough measures against terrorists, including bombing  
raids and arrest of eight associates of Saudi dissident Osama bin 
Laden in the Africa bombings, American interests still are 
vulnerable to attack, Sheehan said. Bin Laden, believed to be in 
Afghanistan, faces federal charges of masterminding the bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, officials have stepped up warnings that bin  
Laden's followers could strike again. 
</P>
<P>
	The unanswered questions: How hard? When? Where? Or will America  
strike first to stop them? 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest example of diplomatic jitters, the U.S. Embassy in  
Islamabad asked the Pakistani government to ensure the safety of 
Americans following threats against Americans if the United States 
again hits bases in neighboring Afghanistan believed to be used by 
bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	Security experts believe new assaults have been deterred by the  
arrests, the U.S. missile assaults against camps in Afghanistan and 
a factory in Sudan shortly after the Aug. 7 bombings, the posting 
of $5 million rewards, sanctions against countries harboring 
terrorists and a range of CIA ``disruption tactics'' against 
terrorist groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Terrorist incidents are, in reality, on the decline globally and  
U.S. officials agree that state-sponsored terrorism has waned. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, fear and caution dominate, and warnings of crises go well  
beyond car bombs. The highest officials vividly project nuclear, 
chemical or biological attack leading to possible global 
catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Welcome to the grave New World of terrorism,'' declared  
Defense Secretary William Cohen in a recent written commentary in 
which he graphically described ``warehouses for the dead'' after 
``a plague more monstrous than anything we have experienced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security, David  
G. Carpenter, summed up the threat as ``global, lethal, 
multidimensional and growing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Department analysts estimate 2,400 threats or incidents aimed at  
U.S. interests overseas in the past year -- more than double the 
same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 70 embassies or consulates have been closed for 24 hours  
or more in response to security concerns or specific threats since 
last August's bombings, said Patrick Kennedy, assistant secretary 
of state for administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy released a summary Wednesday showing that only 31 of the  
260 diplomatic posts meet the recommended requirement of a 100-foot 
safety perimeter to protect against car bombings. He said the 
government has been purchasing property around several embassies to 
provide such buffers. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1.5 billion -- provided in an emergency authorization after  
the bombings -- has gone, in part, to hire 4,000 local guards, 
increase the number of top security agents, install new security 
equipment and fortify or relocate posts. 
</P>
<P>
	Diplomats and analysts say more is needed, and fast.  
</P>
<P>
	``One thing is clear: People will die,'' said Dan Geisler,  
former president of the American Foreign Service Association, which 
represents diplomats on the front lines. The organization has been 
lobbying Congress to increase funding. 
</P>
<P>
	The House last month unanimously authorized $1.4 billion a year  
to protect vulnerable posts. Appropriators, however, cut that by 
two-thirds. 
</P>
<P>
	Final funding for the year awaits year-end budget talks. The  
total bill for added protection over the next decade is estimated 
at $10 billion to $14 billion.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Up 52.55 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in early trading today as a  
planned $9.3 billion merger of Dow Chemical Co. and Union Carbide 
Corp. propped up the blue chips but broader market indicators 
lagged well behind. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 52.55 at 10,729.86. On Tuesday, the blue-chip index rose 31.35 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Tuesday's pattern, other market indexes struggled  
while the Dow marched higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was 
down 1.82 at 1,320.36, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 8.66 
at 2,579.33. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's gains came largely from the news that Dow Chemical is  
buying Union Carbide, building its position as the No. 2 chemical 
company behind DuPont. The two companies said they expect the 
combination to save $500 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Union Carbide soared 11 7/16 to 60 1/4, while Dow Chemical fell 4 1/4  
to 120 7/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, traders remained unconvinced of the market's underlying  
strength. Bond prices, which have tumbled amid the growing belief 
that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates, were holding 
steady today. But the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond now offers a 
yield of 6.16 percent, high enough to lure some investors away from 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were expected to stay in a fairly narrow range through  
Friday, when the Labor Department releases its monthly unemployment 
report. The report is expected to offer the latest indication of 
whether wage pressures are escalating enough to persuade the Fed to 
raise rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 90.8 million 
shares, ahead of Tuesday's pace. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Mixed in Europe Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Share prices were mixed on European stock  
exchanges Wednesday as rising steel stocks were offset by a drop in 
some technology and telecommunications shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers said steel shares were buoyed by hopes of a price  
increase and by news that plans for a merger between British Steel 
and Amsterdam-based steel manufacturer Hoogovens are on track. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Basic Resources index was the best performer on  
the day, with a gain of 2.3 percent, as British Steel shares rose 4 
pence to 170.45 pence and Hoogovens shares rose 1.80 euros to 56.70 
euros. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks 297 companies in  
countries that have joined the single currency, closed down 0.99 
points at 309.43. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index fell 23.36 
points to 3590.69, while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index closed down 24.10 
points at 3585.82. 
</P>
<P>
	BASF led chemical stocks higher on merger speculation. The stock  
gained 5.3 percent, or 2.26 euros, to close at 44.74 euros, as a 
merger between Dow Chemical and Union Carbide prompted talk of 
further tie-ups, and lifted the Dow Jones Industrial Average as 
much as 152.60 points, or 1.4 percent, to 10,829.91 at the opening. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement will create the world's second-largest chemical  
group, with combined annual revenues of $24 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Chemical index closed up 1.7 percent, making it  
the second-best performer on the day. Other chemical shares that 
rose included Bayer, up 86 cents at 41.30 euros, and ICI, up 9 
pence at 752 pence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paris CAC-40 index fell 0.7 percent to 4326.20, with shares  
of Banque Nationale de Paris, Societe Generale and Paribas down on 
concern that a protracted takeover battle may end with BNP gaining 
control of Paribas, but not Societe Generale. 
</P>
<P>
	Milan's MIBtel index fell 0.6 percent to 32,534, while  
Amsterdam's AEX index rose 0.1 percent to 540.68. London's 
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed down 0.2 
percent at 6,235.4. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in British Telecommunications PLC fell 46 pence to 986  
pence on reports that rival Telewest Communications is expected to 
launch a high-speed Internet service.

<HEADLINE> Sandpiper Teams With RealNetworks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) -- Sandpiper Networks Inc., which  
helps the LATimes.com site and America Online put content on the 
Internet, is teaming with RealNetworks Inc. to provide streaming 
media services to its clients. 
</P>
<P>
	In the agreement announced Wednesday, customers of Sandpiper can  
acquire RealNetworks software licenses for broadcasting live events 
through Sandpiper. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, Sandpiper, through its network of more than 400  
worldwide server computers, has delivered real-time events such as 
the 1999 Academy Awards and the release of the Ken Starr Report for 
its clients, the company's vice president of marketing Scott Yara 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed, but the  
Seattle-based RealNetworks will receive software licensing fees and 
a share in revenue resulting from the venture, Yara said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandpiper's network of computers, known as Footprint, lets  
publishers outsource the delivery end of their operations. 
</P>
<P>
	While many of its clients' sites already have their own  
streaming media services, Sandpiper's providing it via its network 
will mean better quality and quicker service, Yara said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandpiper, based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., can do that because  
it gives viewers of its clients' Web sites information they request 
from a server that is geographically closest to them. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Sandpiper announced that it received a $21.5 million  
round of financing involving AOL, Inktomi and an affiliate of 
Times-Mirror, which owns the Los Angeles Times.

<HEADLINE> Springer in Senate Frightens Some </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- There's a joke going around about how Ohio  
Democrats could find a rich and famous candidate for U.S. Senate: 
Jerry Springer might throw his chair into the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everybody's laughing.  
</P>
<P>
	Springer, 55, has said he'll consider running as a Democratic  
challenger to Sen. Mike DeWine, who is up for re-election next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing I thought when I heard his name proposed was,  
`Are these guys nuts? Are they totally insane?''' Jim Schifrin, who 
publishes an independent political newsletter called The 
Whistleblower, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer is a former two-term mayor of Cincinnati who ran for  
governor in 1982, then embarked on a TV career, working as an 
anchor and commentator before discovering that brawling, 
chair-throwing freaks and geeks could make him the nation's No. 
2-rated daytime talk show host. 
</P>
<P>
	DeWine is a former prosecutor whose low-key earnestness led  
colleagues to choose him to preside over Monica Lewinsky's 
deposition in President Clinton's impeachment trial. Messy affairs 
like that are mainstays of ``The Jerry Springer Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeWine has not commented on Springer, but the state's Republican  
chairman, Bob Bennett, has been brandishing jabs like, ``Was Howard 
Stern busy?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schifrin put out a Top 10 list of reasons for a Springer  
candidacy, with entries such as No. 9, ``He's promised to stop 
paying prostitutes with checks.'' Springer did that once as a young 
councilman in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of a Senate run surfaced July 20 in The Plain Dealer of  
Cleveland. Springer's hometown pal in Cincinnati, Hamilton County 
Democratic Party Chairman Tim Burke, told the newspaper the 
talk-show host would be a ``viable, fascinating, interesting 
candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Wrong, wrong and wrong,'' the Plain Dealer editorialized the  
next day. A spasm of righteousness rippled across the state. An 
editorial in The Vindicator of Youngstown called Springer 
``ringmaster of the nation's sleaziest circus.'' Toledo Mayor Carty 
Finkbeiner said Springer would get in the way of his party's 
emphasis on ``family values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Springer put out a statement saying: ``I'm obviously flattered  
and honored by the interest. It's just that at this time I don't 
know whether it's practical or possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Springer said he's giving the Senate race serious consideration  
and will decide by Labor Day. The filing deadline is not until Jan. 
7, but to put on a campaign, Springer would have to deal with 
residency -- he lives in Chicago -- and figure out what to do with 
the syndicated show that has earned him millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer left the country for a vacation late last month after  
his show went on hiatus, and was not available to comment further, 
his publicist Linda Shaffron said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio Democratic chairman David Leland said the party executive  
committee would decide later this year whether to endorse a 
candidate. Columbus lawyer Richard Cordray, the party's 
unsuccessful candidate for state attorney general last year, is 
seeking that backing. 
</P>
<P>
	Leland said he hadn't heard from Springer, but if he does he'll  
tell him that people across the state have strong feelings about a 
possible candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people who are incensed about the fact that he would  
do this,'' Leland said. ``They think it would not be a good 
thing,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Leland said, some people are volunteering to help  
Springer, others think he has no chance, and yet a third group is 
scared he'd win.

<HEADLINE> Web Investors Still Optimistic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The big selloff in Internet stocks that began  
quietly during the spring is suddenly accelerating, decimating the 
phenomenal gains achieved this year by many high-profile online 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Considered almost invincible early this year, online stocks  
dragged down the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index for a 
fifth straight day on Wednesday, leaving it a painful 11.3 percent 
lower than the all-time high it reached July 16. 
</P>
<P>
	The 40-stock Dow Jones Internet Index has shed more than 40  
percent of its value since it hit an all-time high on April 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the pain, investors are snubbing new stock offerings  
from Internet firms. The market for initial public offerings, or 
IPOs, of Internet stocks had seemed virtually bulletproof through 
the first half of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite the jitters that the declines have spread across  
Wall Street, there are some investors who are welcoming the slump 
as an opportunity to buy these stocks at levels far below the 
astronomical prices of this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something like this had to happen, given the large number of  
Internet companies that have filed for IPOs recently. It's 
healthy,'' said Ken Fleming, an analyst with Renaissance Capital 
Corp., a financial research firm in Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	``The underlying sentiment remains 'come back, come back'  
because people love to believe in the potential of the future, 
especially Americans,'' said Steve Harmon, a San Francisco-based 
Internet analyst and money manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, sharp declines are scary for investors who bought  
when stocks were peaking. 
</P>
<P>
	The retailer Amazon.com, for example, hit an all-time high of  
$221.25 April 27. Its price at the close of Wednesday's trading 
session was $88.44, a 60 percent decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Henceforth, investors may have to be more choosy.  
</P>
<P>
	``We all know the Internet is here to stay and there will be  
significant survivors. We just don't know who those survivors will 
be,'' said Edmund Cashman, co-head of capital markets for Legg 
Mason Wood Walker, a Baltimore investment bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding those survivors won't be easy. Cashman noted that the  
stocks of most Internet companies continue to trade at prices that 
have no historical precedence. Traditional methods of placing a 
value on a company's stock have been thrown out the window as 
investors have increasingly gambled solely on an online company's 
potential to earn money, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of the brokerage firm Charles Schwab Corp., which has a  
big online business, have traded recently at a price that's 100 
times the company's annual earnings per share. By comparison, the 
shares of conventional brokerage firms such as Lehman Brothers and 
PaineWebber generally trade at prices that are 15 times the 
company's earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation is even more surreal for the vast majority of  
Internet companies that have recently made their first public 
offering of stock because most of those companies are at high 
levels even though most have never earned a profit, Cashman noted. 
</P>
<P>
	The weakness in recent IPOs indicates that investors are  
starting to get selective. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the stocks of four Internet companies sank in their  
debuts on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Prior to Tuesday, of the dozens 
of Internet companies that have completed initial public offerings 
in the last year, just three failed to make gains in their first 
day of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	None of this has deterred investors such as Daniel Wang, 44, of  
Basking Ridge, N.J. Wang said he first began investing in the 
sector earlier this year, when many of the stocks were already 
approaching their highs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should have jumped in earlier,'' he said. ``I believe a few  
years from now, these stocks will be a good investment. There's 
definitely a future in these companies.''

<HEADLINE> House Passes Inventor Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- By a wide margin, the House approved  
legislation today that would strengthen the patent system and 
safeguard independent inventors, though opponents said the bill 
would threaten the livelihoods of small-scale inventors. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would protect inventors from predatory promoters,  
guarantee them 17 years' protection after the Patent and Trademark 
Office has granted a patent, and maintain confidentiality for some 
patent applications. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar legislation died in the Senate in 1997 after winning  
approval in the House, 220-193. Lawmakers made some changes this 
year to address concerns that the bill made small-scale inventors 
more vulnerable to theft and litigation, leading to House passage 
by a 376-43 vote Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., who led the opposition in 1997,  
said the new bill was a ``major victory for the independent 
inventor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chief sponsor, Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., said it would make  
the patent system, ``already the world's best, even better in the 
new millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, which now goes to the Senate, would give an inventor  
17 years of protection after being granted a patent. The protection 
now is 20 years from application, which can be shorter than 17 
years if the patent office takes longer than three years to grant 
the patent. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would track European and Japanese practices by  
publishing applications after 18 months, but inventors who seek 
patents only in the United States still could claim 
confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
	Coble and others argued that publication would make it easier to  
attract investors and inform potential rivals that someone has 
already staked a claim. Palo Alto, Calif., patent litigator Jim 
Pooley noted it is ``the collective judgment of the industrial 
world that 18 months ought to be plenty of time'' for an inventor 
to describe his creation. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics said it would make it easier for big corporations  
and foreign countries to steal a small-scale inventor's product. 
</P>
<P>
	``A big company can come in and wipe out an inventor,'' said  
Beverly Selby, executive director of the Alliance for American 
Innovation. ``We will pay a price for this over the next 50 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selby and other representatives of inventors also objected to  
``prior user rights'' in the legislation that provides a legal 
defense against charges of patent infringement filed by parties 
that later get a patent. 
</P>
<P>
	Phyllis Schlafly of the conservative Eagle Forum said it would  
``enable corporations to claim a 'prior use right' and thereby 
steal the independent inventor's constitutional right to 
'exclusive' ownership of his discovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But supporters argued that the defense can only be used for  
methods, not products, and would help small businesses who rely on 
trade secrecy laws rather than going to the trouble of trying to 
get patents for every method used in production. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also aims, through early publication, to counter  
``submarining'' -- the practice by which people delay action on 
their patent applications and then file huge lawsuits against 
competitors, who, not knowing a patent is on file, come out with 
similar products. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1907.

<HEADLINE> British Olympic Champion Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Sprinter Linford Christie, a former Olympic  
champion who at 39 rarely competes, was suspended Wednesday for 
suspicion of steroid use. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Amateur Athletic Federation said his drug test  
suggested the presence of the steroid nandrolone. The test was 
taken during a February meet at Dortmund, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Christie, the 100-meter gold medalist at the 1992 Barcelona  
Games, insists he is ``completely innocent'' and intends to defend 
himself against charges. 
</P>
<P>
	His suspension came on the same day Cuban high jump great Javier  
Sotomayor was stripped of his gold medal at the Pan American Games 
in Winnipeg, Manitoba, for testing positive for cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	The day before, American sprinter Dennis Mitchell received a  
two-year drug ban from IAAF for a test that showed a high level of 
testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor will be suspended for two years and miss this month's  
world championships in Spain and the 2000 Sydney Olympics. 
Mitchell's ban is retroactive and he is eligible for Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF, the world ruling body for track and field, said  
Christie's sample is not regarded as a positive test. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot conclude the Christie case has been proved,'' IAAF  
spokesman Giorgio Reineri. 
</P>
<P>
	If it is, Christie will receive at least a two-year suspension  
retroactive to the day after the drug test. Reineri said this case 
is unusual because Christie no longer competes seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have consistently opposed the use of banned substances by  
athletes and it is ridiculous to imagine that I would take them 
after my retirement,'' said Christie, who now coaches British 
sprinters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I agree that there should be a full investigation into the  
numerous cases where metabolites of nandrolone have been found in 
urine samples to establish how this could happen without the 
knowledge of the athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christie's suspension is in force until an investigation is  
completed. But that could take several months and until then 
Christie faces scrutiny as he coaches runners for the world 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``The unfortunate thing is that this puts a cloud over  
everything Linford has done, whether he is innocent or guilty,'' 
said Derek Redmond, a former 400-meter runner who was one of 
Christie's teammates at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	UK Athletics, the British track body, said: ``It is important to  
note that the imposition of a suspension is not a declaration of 
guilt but rather the result of a decision that there is a case to 
answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, UK Athletics cleared European 200-meter champion Doug  
Walker who had tested positive for nandrolone. 
</P>
<P>
	Christie has consistently spoken out against drugs. But he has  
had to fight accusations that his success might be tied to 
performance-enhancing substances. 
</P>
<P>
	At the 1998 Seoul Olympics, Christie finished third behind Ben  
Johnson and Carl Lewis but wound up with the silver after Johnson 
was stripped of the title for taking steroids. 
</P>
<P>
	Christie survived a scare when a banned substance showed in his  
urine sample. However, the substance derived from ginseng in a 
health drink and was cleared as acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, Christie won $64,000 in libel damages from a  
magazine writer who said his track performances were the result of 
taking drugs.

<HEADLINE> Calif. City Claims School Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COMPTON, Calif. (AP) -- City officials have declared a state of  
emergency in Compton's schools following a series of arson fires, 
the latest blow for a troubled district that serves 29,000 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	The city also said it would pursue a plan for volunteer  
``sentinels'' to patrol schools 24 hours a day. Compton and the 
school district each are offering $10,000 for information about the 
eight fires this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state of California is responsible for these fires even if  
they haven't set them themselves,'' Mayor Omar Bradley said 
Tuesday. ``We intend to make sure when the state leaves we still 
have schools to administer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fires have caused $1.7 million in damage at six facilities  
in the 40-school district. Six fires damaged classrooms; two others 
were set in unoccupied buildings. No one has been hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire and police officials would say little about the  
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of the nature of the fires and the location of the  
fires we believe it's more than a firebug at this time,'' Fire 
Chief Milfred Fonza said without elaboration. 
</P>
<P>
	The Compton Unified School District was taken over by the state  
in 1993 as it teetered near bankruptcy. It has been the object of a 
battle by local officials to regain control. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 people signed up as volunteers after the City Council  
approved the emergency declaration on a 4-0 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I teach in the district and I don't want to see the schools  
burn down,'' said Carl Robinson, 64, offering to watch schools for 
six hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
	The district viewed the patrol plan with caution.  
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is nobody will be allowed on our campus,''  
said district spokesman Fausto Capobianco. ``It would be in 
violation of state law and it would create confusion on our 
campuses. Who is to tell if one of these people is the perpetrator 
himself?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capobianco said the district has already increased patrols and  
is spending $3.5 million on installing fire and intruder alarms at 
its schools.

<HEADLINE> Giants Place Kent on 15-Day DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Jeff Kent, who missed seven games with the San  
Francisco Giants because of inflammation in his left foot, was 
placed on the 15-day disabled list Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent returned Monday night in the series opener against the  
Arizona Diamondbacks, going 2-for-4 with an RBI in San Francisco's 
16-6 loss. But Kent was on the bench again Tuesday night as the 
pain worsened. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent flew back to San Francisco on Wednesday and was examined by  
foot specialist Dr. Larry Oloff, who placed the foot in a 
weight-bearing cast. Kent will be eligible to come off the disabled 
list on Aug. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent had been bothered by the injury since early in the season  
but still was selected to the All-Star game for the first time in 
his career. He is hitting .292 with 64 RBIs and 13 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent was bothered by a similar problem in his right foot last  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramon Martinez has started three of the last four games at short  
for the Giants after being recalled from Triple-A Fresno on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	By placing Kent on the DL, the Giants did not have to make  
another roster move to make room for right-handed pitcher Joe 
Nathan, who started Wednesday against Arizona after being recalled 
from Fresno.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Promises To Veto Tax Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today promised to veto a  
Republican plan that would lower the tax rate of every American who 
pays income tax. He called the bill ``risky and plainly wrong for 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-year, $792 billion tax cut package put together by House  
and Senate Republicans would gradually cut 1 percentage point off 
each personal income tax rate. It also would provide relief from 
the so-called marriage penalty, cut the individual capital-gains 
tax rate and eventually eliminate the estate tax. 
</P>
<P>
	As details were worked out at the staff level, one senior Senate  
aide said the package would propose reducing the 15 percent bracket 
to 14.5 percent next year, with a further cut to 14 percent in 
2006. At that point, the income level under which people would fall 
into the 14 percent, or lowest bracket, would be raised by between 
$4,000 and $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they conclude this plan and send it to me,'' Clinton said,  
``I will have to veto it. I will refuse to sign any plan that signs 
away our commitment to America's future, Social Security, Medicare, 
paying down the debt.'' Speaking with reporters in the Rose Garden, 
Clinton said the GOP formula would jeopardize the economic success 
the nation has enjoyed under his administration and ``revert to one 
that is a proven failure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with the start of the August vacation at the end of the  
week, negotiators moved with unusual speed over two days of talks 
to resolve differences in the House and Senate bills, each of which 
totaled $792 billion in cuts but differed substantially in details. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP leadership intends to move the bill through both the  
House and Senate on Thursday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and House Speaker  
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., were actively involved in the negotiations, 
while Democrats, who overwhelmingly opposed the GOP plans, were 
shut out of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republicans have sequestered themselves in a room in order  
to piece together a political bill they know is going nowhere,'' 
said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., ranking Democrat on the Ways and 
Means panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House brushed off warnings by Lott and House Majority  
Leader Dick Armey that prospects are dimming that Congress and 
Clinton can agree on a tax bill this year. ``The remarks sound like 
two leaders in a sandbox,'' presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart 
said. ``If they don't get their way, they don't want to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the GOP tax numbers ``just don't add up. It's pretty  
clear the Republican leadership is interested in making a political 
statement.'' And he countered a question about the political 
consequences of vetoing a tax cut with assurances that voters are 
cognizant of the administration's economic record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Others will handicap the risks of what the president is going  
to do, but he's going to do it because it's the right thing for the 
public,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said repeatedly that he will veto the GOP bill  
because he says the tax cut would use up almost all of the 
projected non-Social Security surplus over the next decade, leaving 
almost nothing for needed government programs and paying down the 
national debt. Clinton and most Democrats have said that any cut 
over $300 billion would be unacceptably risky to the nation's 
economic future. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans insist they can return the money to the taxpayers  
that rightfully belongs to them and still have enough to save 
Social Security and Medicare and pay down part of the national 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the GOP plan, each of the five tax brackets would go down  
by 1 percentage point. The lowest 15 percent tax bracket would fall 
to 14 percent in 2001, and the highest 39.6 percent bracket would 
become 38.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The House-passed bill included a 10 percent across-the-board tax  
cut, which was strongly criticized by the White House and Democrats 
as disproportionately favoring wealthy taxpayers. The 1 percentage 
point cut would give taxpayers in the 15 percent bracket a 7 
percent cut, better than that in the higher brackets. 
</P>
<P>
	To alleviate the marriage penalty, under which some married  
couples pay more in taxes than if they were single because their 
combined income moves them into a higher bracket, the Republican 
bill would gradually raise the standard deduction for couples until 
it is double the level permitted for individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, it would widen the current 15 percent bracket for  
couples so it would apply to some income that currently is taxed at 
28 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	There would be no cuts in the corporate capital gains tax, but  
personal capital gains taxes would be reduced from 20 percent to 18 
percent on some gains and 10 percent to 8 percent on others -- and 
adjusted annually for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance  
Committee, said contribution limits to individual retirement 
accounts would rise gradually from $2,000 to $5,000 annually. He 
said the self-employed would be permitted to deduct the entire cost 
of their health insurance premiums. Other officials said medical 
savings accounts, tax-deductible accounts set aside for 
health-related costs, would be more readily available. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it would not be sent to the president until after  
Congress returned to work in September, giving supporters the 
chance to return home and tout the bill's benefits to their 
constituents. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans ``would like to take our message to the American  
people,'' Lott said. ``Maybe the president will conclude at some 
point that he needs to work with us.''

<HEADLINE> Market Fever Takes Hold of Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) -- Market fever has taken hold in Cyprus. It  
has gotten to the point, islanders joke, that even a poor village 
shepherd -- symbol of the country's enduring traditions -- would sell 
his goats to buy shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Never mind that the three-year-old market lists only 116  
securities and merits barely a tick on international financial 
screens. Investing in shares is an obsession with Cypriots, with 
thousands throwing caution to the wind and abandoning the safety of 
deposit accounts and land, until recently the dominant investment 
choices on this Mediterranean holiday island. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, there are stories making the rounds of a couple playing the  
market with money that had been set aside for their children's 
college education, or a grandmother who is a first-time investor at 
age 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-eight-year old architect George Alexandros bought shares  
for the first time in late July, putting $5,430 in savings into a 
local retailer. Married with two children, Alexandros wanted to get 
into the market earlier, but had no cash to spare. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not want to do what everyone else is doing, and borrow  
money to play the market. Now, I have put just enough that even if 
the market crashes, I won't go hungry,'' Alexandros said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to gamble and I am likely to make more money in the  
market than betting on football,'' he added. ``I need to make 
enough money on the market to pay 6,000 pounds ($10,860) 
outstanding on a debt I took to buy a piece of land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Less than two years ago, brokers at the Cyprus Stock Exchange  
complained that trade was so thin they played games on their 
computers on some days to pass the time. A volume of $900,000 was 
not unusual and not many of the island's 700,000 people even knew 
their country had a market. 
</P>
<P>
	Not anymore.  
</P>
<P>
	The Cyprus market's capitalization stood at $6.11 billion by the  
end of June, nearly double what it was in December. Bank shares 
account for more than two-thirds of the market's capitalization. 
</P>
<P>
	State television recently began broadcasting prices live during  
the 90 daily minutes of trading, Monday through Friday. Bankers are 
reporting an unusual upsurge in borrowing by clients to buy shares, 
prompting the Central Bank to instruct them to tighten credit 
facilities offered to what it called ``market speculators and 
gamblers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A meteoric rise in share prices since the start of the year -- an  
increase of more than 212 percent through today from its lows in 
the first week of January -- was both evidence of demand and the 
trigger that unleashed a new wave of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	The dramatic increase in prices was accompanied by a surge in  
volume that is partly caused by the introduction in early May of 
automated trading to replace a cumbersome open-cry system. The 
average number of daily transactions has since shot up from 500 to 
4,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The volume, which registered an all-time record $124.85 million  
July 28, caused such a backlog of administrative work that the 
market was closed July 26 and 27 to give brokerages and listed 
companies time to clear transactions. On Monday, a further closing 
for the week starting Aug. 9 was announced, after brokers 
complained that two days was not enough. 
</P>
<P>
	There are fears that shares are becoming overvalued and that the  
market was turning into a speculative bubble that might burst. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has gone crazy,'' said senior economist Marios Clerides.  
``We have reached a stage where there is no connection between a 
company's actual value and its share capital. People are buying 
shares like tomatoes and cucumbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one is looking at the fundamentals of companies in which  
they are buying, the same way no one is going to look at the 
fundamentals when the selling begins,'' he said, warning of a 
downward correction that might trigger panic selling. 
</P>
<P>
	The market has occasionally dipped for one or two sessions and  
then returned to bullishness. 
</P>
<P>
	Beside demand from newcomers, the market's rally is being  
sustained by relative political stability on the war-divided island 
and the positive sentiment arising from the prospect of the 
island's leading banks being listed in the boisterous Athens Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rally is also fed by the belief that the island's European  
Union accession is going smoothly,'' said Yiannos Tirkides, chief 
economist at the Popular Bank, the island's second largest. ``But 
you must also factor in human greed.''

<HEADLINE>  Clean-Shaven Earnhardt Gets Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Dale Earnhardt showed up at the Indianapolis  
Motor Speedway on Wednesday with a clean-shaven upper lip. His 
trademark mustache was gone for the first time in 17 years, a 
sacrifice to his determination not to be beaten -- at anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael (Waltrip) made me shave it off,'' Earnhardt said. ``We  
were down in the Bahamas on Saturday, snorkeling, and he was 
getting down deeper than I was. I was drowning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bushy lip, it turned out, prevented a tight seal between his  
mask and his face. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to do something to get down there with him. I had to  
shave so I could get deeper. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it'll affect any of my racing skills,'' he said.  
``It didn't in '82, anyway. We still won races.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Practice for the fourth and final round of this year's  
International Race of Champions series began on Wednesday. 
Earnhardt won each of the first three races and on Friday could 
become the first driver to sweep all four races since the series 
began in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Practice and qualifications for Saturday's Brickyard 400 Winston  
Cup race will begin on Thursday. Earnhardt, the 1995 Brickyard 
winner, has won only one race this season and is seventh in series 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've qualified pretty good and raced pretty good in the last  
several races,'' Earnhardt said. ``I want to be up front racing. 
That strategy of racing for the top five and racing for the win is 
where everybody wants to be. It seems like our program is going 
that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Gordon, who turned 28 on Wednesday, became the first  
two-time Brickyard winner last year and is just ahead of Earnhardt 
in sixth place in the season standings. The leader is Dale Jarrett, 
who has won three races and has used consistent finishes to build a 
254-point lead over Mark Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's race on the 2 1/2-mile, low-banked Speedway oval is the  
20th of the 34 Winston Cup races this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This race track is a track that anything can happen at,''  
Earnhardt said. ``Guys had trouble here and lost races, guys had 
great pit stops and won races, like we did in '95. And gas mileage 
has won races, like Ricky Rudd (in 1997). 
</P>
<P>
	``Strategy plays out at the end. ... It could come down to that  
one last stop and whether you take tires or not, whether you just 
take a little gas or what.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt also was the 1990 and 1995 IROC champion. Among the 11  
other drivers in this year's series is his son, Dale Jr., who lost 
to his father by .007 second in the last race at Michigan Speedway 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Others in IROC this year are Gordon, Martin, Jarrett, Rusty  
Wallace, Bobby Labonte and Jeff Burton from NASCAR; Eddie Cheever 
and 1999 Indy 500 winner Kenny Brack from the Indy Racing League; 
and Adrian Fernandez and Greg Moore from Championship Auto Racing 
Teams. All drivers are in identically prepared IROC cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, the 1995 Indy Lights champion and fifth in the CART  
series last season, hit the second-turn wall early in Wednesday's 
IROC practice. He was not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unique to race in IROC,'' the elder Earnhardt said. ``To  
win is also great. To come in and win three races already this year 
and maybe set a record by winning four is pretty unique. But guys 
like Mark Martin, Rusty Wallace and these guys are not wanting that 
to happen. Then my kid's in there, aggravating the hell out of 
me.''

<HEADLINE> Agreement Near on HMO Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democrats and a group of moderate  
Republicans were close to agreement on writing legislation to 
impose new regulations on health maintenance organizations and 
allow patients to sue them, aides said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bipartisan proposal was to be announced before the end of  
the week, when Congress leaves for its August vacation, Democratic 
and Republican aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the House  
Commerce Committee, and Rep. Charles Norwood, R-N.C., were working 
to put the final touches on the proposal, said Norwood's spokesman, 
John Stone. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate last month passed a Republican-backed modest set of  
patient protections for Americans worried that their health care 
needs are of secondary concern to cost-cutting HMOs. Administration 
officials said President Clinton would veto that bill if it was 
sent to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts by Republican leaders to offer a similar bill in the  
House hit a snag when a group of Republicans led by Norwood, Tom 
Coburn of Oklahoma and Greg Ganske of Iowa -- all health care 
providers before entering Congress -- said they preferred the 
tougher approach sought by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan to be introduced by Dingell and Norwood would give  
patients the right to seek a third opinion from medical specialists 
if their HMO plan denies coverage and allow a patient to sue an HMO 
if an injury results from a covered benefit being denied. 
</P>
<P>
	However, HMOs that abide by federal rules establishing internal  
and external appeals procedures for patients would be exempt from 
liability suits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dingell-Norwood proposal also would require HMOs to pay the  
bills of medical specialists who are not provider members of the 
organization and any emergency care. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate-passed plan does not allow lawsuits, which most  
Republicans contend would drive up the costs of health care, but 
does include easier access to specialists, emergency rooms and 
obstetricians and gynecologists. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources said the House negotiators were down to a few relatively  
minor issues such as how to protect hospital whisteblowers.

<HEADLINE> Dow Chemical To Buy Union Carbide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Dow Chemical Co., the maker of Styrofoam, is  
buying Union Carbide Corp., the leader in producing the chemicals 
used in making polyester and antifreeze. 
</P>
<P>
	The $9.3 billion deal announced Wednesday would create the  
world's second-largest chemical business behind DuPont Co., 
strengthening Dow's perch in a sluggish chemical market beset by 
depressed prices due to a drop in demand in struggling overseas 
economies. 
</P>
<P>
	The merged company, which will operate under the Dow Chemical  
name, will have $24 billion in annual revenue, putting it ahead of 
the current No. 2, Germany's BASF AG, according to the most recent 
rankings by Chemical Week, a magazine covering the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2,000 jobs will be cut as a result of the merger, leaving  
about 49,000 employees. Dow Chemical said the cuts would come 
through reduced hiring and attrition, but Dow Chemical President 
and chief executive William S. Stavropoulos declined to be more 
specific about where the cuts might be made. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies said they expect the combination to save $500  
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger would unite two companies that have faced crises.  
</P>
<P>
	A 1984 leak at Union Carbide's pesticide plant in Bhopal, India,  
killed 4,000 people and injured 50,000 in the world's worst 
recorded industrial accident. A court in Bhopal later ruled that 
exposure to the gas claimed thousands of additional lives over the 
years since the leak. Union Carbide paid a $470 million settlement 
in India's Supreme Court in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Chemical is a half-owner of Dow Corning Corp., the former  
silicone breast implant manufacturer which has offered to pay $3.2 
billion to settle claims from 170,000 women who claim illnesses 
resulted from their implants. Dow Corning no longer makes breast 
implants. 
</P>
<P>
	The merged company's corporate headquarters will remain in  
Midland, Mich., where Dow Chemical is based. 
</P>
<P>
	``This transaction is a giant step in our strategy to transform  
Dow into the world's most productive, best 'value-growth' company 
in the chemical industry,'' Stavropoulos said. Dow is ranked third 
in the world in chemical sales and second in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow ``is the ideal partner to move forward,'' said William  
Joyce, Union Carbide's chairman and chief executive. ``The new Dow 
is much, much stronger than either company has been in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Union Carbide is ranked 21st in the world in chemical sales and  
seventh in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Union Carbide shareholders will receive 0.537  
share of Dow Chemical for each of their Union Carbide shares -- or 
$66.96 based on Tuesday's closing price of Dow Chemical's stock. 
Dow Chemical will also assume $2.3 billion in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Union Carbide shareholders will own about 25 percent of Dow  
Chemical after the deal is complete, and Joyce will become vice 
chairman of the Dow Chemical board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the merger sent Union Carbide's stock soaring $10.56 1/4,or  
by almost 22 percent, to $59.37 1/2 a share Wednesday on the New York 
Stock Exchange, where Dow Chemical's stock slid $6.06 1/4, or by 
almost 5 percent, to $118.62 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock market analysts said the deal made sense.  
</P>
<P>
	``We like it,'' said Alex Hittle, an associate analyst at A.G.  
Edwards &AMP; Sons. ``You've got two companies, both of whom are in the 
down part of the commodities cycle now. That's a good time for Dow 
to be a buyer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hittle said the companies complement each other, with little  
duplication in businesses, but there was still some risk for Dow. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Dow Chemical has been weathering the industry's downturn  
because it has built up its business in specialty chemicals, which 
are designed to enhance the performance of other products and have 
specialized markets. The acquisition of Union Carbide ``seems to be 
a move back to basic chemicals,'' which are sold in bulk to a wide 
range of industries. 
</P>
<P>
	``That could be risky for them if they have trouble operating  
Carbide's assets or if the trough drags on longer than expected,'' 
Hittle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Raj Kothari, director of GMA Capital, a mergers and acquisitions  
firm in Farmington Hills, Mich., said there were logistical 
challenges in making the merger work. 
</P>
<P>
	``The short-term hurdle will be how do you integrate two global  
organizations as big as these two. Basically what you're trying to 
acheive is one plus one equals three,'' Kothari said. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger requires the approval of Union Carbide shareholders  
and U.S and European antitrust regulators. The companies said they

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Nomination Clears Hurdle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The high-profile post of U.S. ambassador to  
the United Nations, long vacant, appears close to being filled as 
the Senate finally prepares to vote on the nomination of Richard 
Holbrooke. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of both parties are predicting easy confirmation for the  
combative career diplomat when the Senate takes up the nomination 
today -- after 14 months of delay, partisan wrangling and suspense. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke, an investment banker, is a former ambassador to  
Germany and was architect of the 1995 accord that ended the war in 
Bosnia. He also has served as Clinton's special envoy in the Kosovo 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	A confirmation vote was all but assured on Wednesday when Sen.  
Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, the final senator blocking the 
nomination, lifted his objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley said his tactics hadn't been personal. ``I intend to  
vote for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley is in a standoff with the State Department over its  
treatment of a career employee he claims was punished for sharing 
information on U.N. financial irregularities with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	But Grassley's tactics created new problems for other diplomatic  
nominees. Grassley said he instead would block three other pending 
nominations, including that of Peter Burleigh as ambassador to the 
Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
	Burleigh has been filling in for Holbrooke at the United Nations  
since last September. In New York, Burleigh said he would have no 
comment on Grassley's hold on him. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley said he was also putting ``holds'' on Carl Spielvogel  
to be ambassador to the Slovak Republic and Richard Fredericks to 
be ambassador to Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton announced the Holbrooke nomination in June 1998. But it  
quickly became tangled, first in internal investigations at the 
Justice and State departments into Holbrooke's contacts with former 
State Department colleagues and then in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other senators had also sought to block the nomination --  
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, 
and Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio -- but they earlier abandoned the 
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Senate tradition, any member without explanation may block  
action on legislation or a nomination for as long as the majority 
leader permits. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley used the technique to protest the State Department's  
treatment of a whistleblower, Linda Shenwick. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley contends that Shenwick, who worked at the U.N. mission  
in New York, was demoted and transferred to a lesser job in 
Washington in retaliation for her telling members of Congress about 
waste and inefficiency at the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``My interest in this matter is very simple,'' Grassley said.  
``Congress cannot function as an institution if government 
employees cannot communicate with Congress about wrongdoing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department has said Shenwick was reassigned because of  
unsatisfactory job performance, not because she was a 
whistleblower. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. post has been vacant since the last ambassador, Bill  
Richardson, stepped down last September to become energy secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	During the intervening time, the United States launched  
airstrikes against both Iraq and Yugoslavia. Burleigh, the 
assistant U.N. ambassador, served a stint as presiding officer of 
the Security Council and had to deal with the issue of delinquent 
U.S. payments to the international body. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke, 58, had been confirmed by the Senate three times  
previously: in 1977 as assistant secretary of state in the Carter 
administration, again in 1993 as ambassador to Germany, and later 
as assistant secretary of state for European and Canadian affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was a contender for secretary of state in Clinton's  
second term before the president chose Madeleine Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	But Holbrooke, ambitious and with a forceful personality, has  
produced detractors as well as fans, both in Congress and within 
the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been at odds at times with Albright. And he is a favorite  
target for Republicans since he's widely viewed as a likely 
secretary of state if Vice President Al Gore wins the presidency.

<HEADLINE> Pan Am Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- One high jump winner has been stripped  
of a gold medal at the Pan American Games. Is another, Javier 
Sotomayor, about to be? 
</P>
<P>
	After announcing that Juana Rosario Arrendel of the Dominican  
Republic, winner of the women's high jump, was stripped of her 
medal for failing a drug test, organizers said another athlete's 
first test had come back positive. A news conference with Pan 
American Sports Organization president Mario Vazquez Rana and 
medical officers was scheduled for 5 p.m. EDT. Another news 
conference, with Cuban team medical officials, was scheduled for 6 
p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Felix Quintero, Sotomayor's personal physician, will attend  
that news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor is the world indoor and outdoor record-holder and the  
only man to clear 8 feet. He also is the 1992 Olympic champion and 
a four-time Pan Ams winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Rodrigo Alvarez Cambra of the Cuban delegation traveled  
Tuesday to the drug analysis facility in Montreal, sources close to 
the Cuban team said. The sources emphasized that a key medical 
officer of the delegation would not be sent on such an assignment 
if the drug test did not involve a leading Cuban athlete. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor won the high jump on the last day of the track and  
field competition. But neither Vasquez Rana nor the medical 
director of the games, Eduardo de Rose, would confirm that the 
positive A test came from the last day of that competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked specifically if that test came from the final day, de Rose  
said, ``I don't want to answer your question. I have the right to 
no comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arrendel did respond to charges she tested positive for the  
banned anabolic steroid stanozolol, the same substance that caused 
Ben Johnson to be stripped of his gold medal in the 100 meters at 
the 1988 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrendel was quoted in the Dominican Republic as denying she  
used stanozolol and said the test may have picked up a decongestant 
she used before the event. 
</P>
<P>
	``In six years in athletics, I have never used substances to  
enhance my performance,'' she said in remarks published Tuesday in 
the newspaper La Informacion. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Ray Martinez, a baseball player from Mexico, refused to  
take a drug test Monday after his team's loss to Canada in the 
bronze medal game. That was tantamount to a positive test, 
organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrendel won the high jump with a leap of 6 feet, 4 inches and  
had been the Dominican Republic's only gold medalist at the games 
so far. Argentina's Solange Witteveen, the runner-up, now gets the 
gold. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second drug case announced at these games. In the  
first, Steve Vezina, goalkeeper for the Canadian in-line roller 
hockey team that beat the United States 7-6 in the title game, 
tested positive for stimulants and steroids. Canada was stripped of 
the gold, which was awarded to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	American middleweight Arthur Palac advanced to the boxing  
semifinals, using his reach and unorthodox style to outpoint David 
Sanchez of Mexico 8-3. 
</P>
<P>
	At 6-foot-4 and 165 pounds, the left-handed Palac makes an  
awkward opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, I don't want to fight, although I can if I need  
to,'' said Palac, whose father is a former Polish boxer and his 
coach. ``I want to box and keep them at the end of my punches. And 
being left-handed is good for the computer system, because the 
judges will always count your jabs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another U.S. winner in the quarterfinals was welterweight  
LaChaunce Shepherd, who decisioned Francisco Calderon of Columbia 
8-3. But light heavyweight Joseph Pastorello, a captain in the U.S. 
Air Force, lost a tight 3-2 decision to Brazil's Laudelino Barros. 
The match was tied heading into the fourth and final round. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Cubans scored lopsided victories.  
</P>
<P>
	Welterweight Juan Hernandez, the 1996 Olympics silver medalist,  
had an 11-1 win over Guillermo Saputo of Argentina; middleweight 
Yohason Martinez routed Canada's Trevor Stewardson 10-1; and light 
heavyweight Humberto Savigne was awarded a referee's decision after 
knocking down Barbados' Shawn Cox in the first round with a shot to 
the head. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since 1955, U.S. swimmers failed to get at  
least one medal in an individual event at the Pan Ams. Jarod 
Schroeder of Morrison, Ill., and Sabir Muhammad of Atlanta failed 
to qualify for the final of the men's 100-meter butterfly. 
Schroeder was 11th overall in the prelims at 55.89, Muhammad was 
17th at 57.20. Only the top eight qualify for the final. 
</P>
<P>
	Francisco Sanchez gave Venezuela its first gold ever in the 100  
butterfly with a games record of 53.33. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. men's 800 freestyle relay won the nation's only gold  
Tuesday. Adam Messner, Dan Phillips, Devin Howard and Scott Tucker 
finished just ahead of Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Danielle Henderson of Commack, N.Y., pitched her second perfect  
game of the softball competition, beating the Bahamas 12-0 in five 
innings. She fanned 13 of 15 batters.

<HEADLINE>  Falcons' McDaniels Unique Off Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- For Pellom McDaniels, football is merely  
a starting point for discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Very quickly, the conversation shifts away from zone blitzes and  
blocking schemes to very un-football-like passions such as writing, 
painting and poetry. 
</P>
<P>
	McDaniels is not just a defensive end for the Atlanta Falcons.  
He's an artist and entrepreneur, inventor and philosopher, civic 
crusader and willing role model, dreamer and renaissance man. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once I finally made it to the NFL, I knew if I put my mind to  
something I could do it,'' McDaniels said. ``I started using 
football to get me in a lot of other doors, with my writing, my 
invention and all that other stuff. I just took a chance. I found 
out the worst thing in life that people could tell me was `no.' I 
find out the reasons they say no, then turn around and use it to my 
advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's written two books, with a third on the way. ``My Own  
Harlem'' offers poetic musings and deeply personal thoughts of a 
complex young man in search of a place for himself and his people. 
``So You Want To Be A Pro?'' shares with young people his views on 
discipline, coping with peer pressure, time management and the 
importance of education. 
</P>
<P>
	There's more.  
</P>
<P>
	McDaniels and his wife, Navvab, launched the ``Arts for Smarts''  
program, which acquaints thousands of disadvantaged kids with 
dance, theater and literature. He owns and operates a clothing 
business. Even something as common as an unpleasant trip to the 
dentist started the wheels spinning: He invented his own flavored 
gel, got it cleared through the Food and Drug Administration and 
put it on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm an eclectic-type person,'' McDaniels said. ``I let myself  
do anything I want to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDaniels, 31, signed with the Falcons after seven years in  
Kansas City, providing the NFC champions with some much-needed 
depth on the defensive line. It's the same role he played with the 
Chiefs, filling in wherever he was needed on a team that featured 
Neil Smith, Derrick Thomas and Chester McGlockton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figured out a long time ago that if you wanted to do  
anything, you have to know more about it than anyone else,'' 
McDaniels said. ``I learned every position to get the job in Kansas 
City. Whenever I was called upon -- whether it was nose guard, left 
end or right end -- I had to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDaniels' work ethic stems from the rejection he felt on draft  
day in 1990, when no team called despite a solid career at Oregon 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was devastating,'' said McDaniels, who earned a degree in  
communications and political science. ``I thought I did everything 
right in college, in athletics and academics, and it just didn't 
pan out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He took a job selling health and beauty care products, but  
football was still in his blood. The following year, he played for 
the World League's Birmingham Fire, earning a tryout from the 
Philadelphia Eagles. Failing to make the team, he returned to 
Birmingham for another season in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, he earned a spot with the Chiefs in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
	``It all stems from not making it,'' McDaniels said. ``I feel  
blessed going to work every day. I don't take it for granted. It's 
a job, but this game has given me a lot. Confidence, for one. 
Self-esteem. A feeling of accomplishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For him, the greatest feeling is discovering an opponent's  
weakness in the film room, then taking advantage of it on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, for instance, he noticed the Steelers ran a sweep  
every time the tight end went in motion to that side of the field. 
During a Monday night game, he seized on that revelation to tackle 
Jerome Bettis in the backfield for a 7-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a great feeling,'' McDaniels said. ``I may not be a  
starter, but when I play I make plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also makes a difference away from the field.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know about all that other stuff until we started  
talking about signing him,'' Falcons coach Dan Reeves said. ``I've 
never had anybody that has their own company, writes books. ... 
It's really intriguing to see all the stuff he's done.''

<HEADLINE> SEC Proposes `Pay-to-Play Rule' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators, imposing a $10,000 fine on  
a former board member of Florida's Housing Finance Agency accused 
of taking a bribe, also proposed Wednesday a rule to bar money 
managers from making campaign donations to officials who oversee 
public-employee pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice, known as pay-to-play, is legal but can unfairly  
tilt the political playing field, securities regulators and other 
critics say. They contend that thousands of police, firefighters, 
teachers and other public employees may be unwittingly entrusting 
their retirement savings to financial companies with the strongest 
political ties rather than those most qualified to manage the 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	At stake is the management of such pension funds, which hold  
more than $2 trillion in assets nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	William Jay Ramsey, the former board member, is one of several  
public officials ensnared in a criminal investigation of alleged 
bribes that steered Florida municipal bond business to Stephens 
Inc., a prominent investment firm based in Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	The wide-ranging federal probe already has led to the criminal  
conviction of a former Arkansas state legislator who paid bribes to 
help the Stephens firm get two bond underwriting contracts in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	In a civil settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange  
Commission announced Wednesday, Ramsey agreed to pay the $10,000 
fine, return the compensation he allegedly received plus interest, 
a total of $2,190.03, and refrain from future violations of 
securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
	In the settlement, Ramsey neither admitted to nor denied the  
SEC's allegation that he failed to disclose having secretly agreed 
to receive from Stephens $1,500 a month for a year, though he 
allegedly only received one payment. The SEC said that the 1995 
payment was a bribe in return for Ramsey voting to select Stephens 
for bond underwriting business of the housing finance agency. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, federal criminal prosecutors secured an indictment  
against Ramsey on related charges. Stephens agreed the same month 
to pay $3.1 million to federal and north Florida officials to 
settle a civil suit, and the company was barred from underwriting 
bonds in Florida for five years. Stephens also agreed to pay a 
$2.25 million civil fine to the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramsey's attorney, David McGee of Pensacola, Fla., declined  
comment on the matter Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC's action shows the agency ``is continuing to  
aggressively investigate and bring enforcement actions in an effort 
to stamp out pay-to-play practices,'' Kathleen Hamm, an assistant 
enforcement director at the SEC, said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule proposed by the SEC would apply to legal campaign  
contributions to officials by money managers, which regulators want 
to stop on ethical grounds, as opposed to the illegal bribe that 
Ramsey allegedly received. But Ms. Hamm said both kinds of payments 
were examples of pay-to-play. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new proposal, which the SEC opened to a 75-day public  
comment period, money managers would be barred from making 
political donations to state and local officials who oversee 
public-employee pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Plaze, associate director of the SEC's investment management  
division, acknowledged that the proposed rule ``is not campaign 
finance reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not naive enough to expect that we're going to entirely  
eliminate pay-to-play,'' Plaze told reporters in a conference call. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule would prohibit money management firms with more than  
$25 million in assets under management from providing investment 
advice to public pension funds for two years after the firm, or any 
of its partners or executives, contributed to the campaigns of 
certain elected officials or candidates. Donations of $250 or less 
would be exempt. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, money management firms with government clients  
would be required to keep records of their political contributions. 
The records would not be made public but would be provided to SEC 
examiners. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC took similar action in 1994 with regard to the $1.3  
trillion municipal bond market, restricting how much money 
bond-underwriting firms can contribute to state and local 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Since that action, many bond underwriters have gotten around the  
municipal pay-to-play restrictions by making donations to political 
parties rather than particular state and local candidates.

allowing three runs and five hits in 6 2-3 innings. The 
right-hander was lifted after surrendering an RBI single by Rey 
Sanchez that narrowed Anaheim's lead to a run. 
</P>
<P>
	Troy Percival pitched the ninth for his 25th save.  
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Huson also had three hits for the Angels, whose third  
victory in 19 games was tinged with another injury. Just two days 
after Jim Edmonds played for the first time this season following 
surgery on his right shoulder, first baseman Mo Vaughn sat out 
because of a staph infection in his right shin. 
</P>
<P>
	Anaheim scored two unearned runs in the second inning with the  
help of a pair of foul balls -- one that should have been caught and 
one that shouldn't have. 
</P>
<P>
	Darin Erstad, given a second chance when catcher Chad Kreuter  
misplayed his foul pop near the first base dugout, led off with a 
bloop single to left-center. Huson singled with one out and Molina 
doubled past a diving Jermaine Dye in right-center for his first 
big-league hit and RBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando Palmeiro then got a gift sacrifice fly when Johnny Damon  
caught his foul ball in the left field corner and Huson scored 
easily. 
</P>
<P>
	Molina, batting in the ninth spot, increased Anaheim's margin to  
3-1 with an RBI single that chased Kansas City starter Jay Witasick 
(4-8). Two outs later, Molina scored on Garret Anderson's single. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City scored in the fourth on a leadoff double by Damon  
and a two-out single by Mike Sweeney, which extended his hitting 
streak to a career-best 17 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Witasick allowed four runs -- two earned -- and six hits in  
three-plus innings. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Molina, 25, was called up on Tuesday when 12-year veteran  
catcher Charlie O'Brien was designated for assignment. He batted 
.286 with seven home runs and 41 RBIs in 65 games at Triple-A 
Edmonton. ... Plate umpire Tim Tschida wasn't too thrilled about 
Orlando Palmeiro flinging his bat back toward home plate after 
taking a called third strike in the first inning -- until it was 
explained to him that on-deck hitter Gary DiSarcina was about to 
use the same bat. ... Everyone in the Angels' lineup used Edmonds' 
bat the first time through the order. His teammates went 4-for-7 
with a walk. ... DiSarcina went 0-for-3 and remained hitless in his 
last 21 at-bats. ... Witasick's problems could have stemmed from a 
one-hopper by Anderson that struck him just above his pitching 
elbow in the first inning.

<HEADLINE> Deal To Return NFL to L.A. Hurting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- NFL to city: Get money. City to NFL: Get  
real. 
</P>
<P>
	Before awarding the 32nd NFL franchise to Los Angeles, football  
owners have insisted on a stadium deal with more public financing, 
which the state and city have adamantly refused to do. The impasse 
prompted the state's negotiator to quit and sent competing 
ownership groups and local officials scrambling Wednesday to plot 
their next move. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to decide how to invest their dollars,'' NFL  
spokesman Greg Aiello said. ``A new Coliseum or revitalized 
Exposition Park, Super Bowls, other events -- is it worth some level 
of public support? ... If LA decides it's not, we have to explore 
other options. It's their decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to comment, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan issued a  
statement through a spokeswoman saying he ``still believes the NFL 
will do the right thing by awarding a team to Los Angeles and that 
it'll be good for the city and NFL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute has provoked little public outcry from fans still  
stinging from the defection of the Rams and Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest snag climaxed Tuesday with the resignation of Bill  
Chadwick, appointed by Gov. Gray Davis to be the state's chief 
negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
	Chadwick asked NFL owners last week in Chicago to sign a  
non-binding agreement requiring owners to build a stadium on 
publicly owned land at Exposition Park at no cost to taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement said the state would charge the expansion team  
$2.5 million to $5 million in annual rent for the property and 
pledged the state's support for issuing $150 million in bonds to 
pay for parking at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of signing it, NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue asked for  
more cash. Some speculate Chadwick's rent proposal may have irked 
owners; many NFL teams play in rent-free stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL views the parking bonds proposal as league-generated  
money because the funds would be repaid by parking fees for stadium 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	``An NFL expansion team at the Coliseum requires a new stadium  
with adequate access and parking, and an economic plan that allows 
the team to be successful and to compete,'' Aiello said. ``Building 
the stadium and running it under Bill Chadwick's proposal would not 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A frustrated Chadwick sent a three-page resignation letter to  
Davis on Tuesday, suggesting that pro football in Los Angeles might 
not be worth the trouble. The governor's office did not return 
phone calls on whether he will accept the resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	Chadwick, an investment banker, found the NFL's machinations  
infuriating, said state Sen. Kevin Murray of Angeles, who has taken 
part in the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``He put together a good-faith effort ... and by the time he  
gets home, he finds out the NFL is saying, 'We need this, we need 
that,''' Murray said. ``Particularly people outside of government 
get frustrated by that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chadwick won't be gone ``until the governor says, 'I don't want  
you any more,''' Murray added. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives for prospective owners Ed Roski Jr. and Eli  
Broad declined comment. Michael Ovitz, who heads a competing 
ownership group, was out of the country and unavailable to speak, 
his spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL is ``in contact with the governor's office and awaiting  
direction from the governor on how to proceed.'' Aiello said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, football-hungry Houston ready to step in if Los  
Angeles fails to submit an adequate stadium proposal before a Sept. 
15 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe they can do it faster, we couldn't,'' said Bob McNair,  
the businessman heading Houston's NFL bid. ``We know how much work 
it took to do it in Houston, where there is a lot more support. I'm 
not saying it can't be done. It is a real challenge for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houston came in second in March when the NFL chose Los Angeles  
for expansion. Houston offered the NFL a publicly financed $310 
million stadium and guaranteed sellouts for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``For it to be successful, the owner can't put up the money for  
the stadium and the franchise,'' McNair said of Los Angeles' 
proposal. ``It is just too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Allen Sanderson, a professor of economics at the University  
of Chicago who follows sports business, said Los Angeles' approach 
was the right way to go. 
</P>
<P>
	Cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, whose Bears want the  
city to finance a new stadium to replace aging Soldier Field, can 
afford to use a hard-line approach because the NFL is desperate to 
have franchises in metropolitan areas rich with TV households, 
Sanderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles has 5.5 million TV households, compared with 4  
million in Houston. Approximately two-thirds of the NFL's income is 
derived from TV revenue and advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	``You rarely have a decent bargaining position (with the NFL),''  
Sanderson said. ``Los Angeles is in that unique position now, and 
it'd be nice to see them exercise it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cities with smaller TV markets seeking pro football teams need  
to offer big packages to entice the NFL, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue has always been: To what extent can we fleece the  
local economy?'' Sanderson said. ``That strategy hasn't changed 
that much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Returning the NFL to Los Angeles has largely been met with  
indifference from fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We use tax money for everything else,'' said special education  
teacher Janean Gammage, 29, as she stood at the Coliseum. ``We 
might as well use it to bring a team back to LA. I don't mind at 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, no NFL team in Los Angeles has its advantages to some  
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without a football team, we don't have to deal with being  
blacked out of all the good games on TV,'' said sales 
representative Jeff Suckiel.

<HEADLINE> Corn, Soybeans Extend Rally / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Corn and soybean futures extended their rally  
early today on the Chicago Board of Trade, while wheat futures also 
gained. 
</P>
<P>
	After initially opening lower, corn and soybeans moved higher as  
investors worried about recent yield losses from hot, dry weather 
across key growing states. Analysts continue to revise downward 
their estimates for final fall production after the government 
earlier this week reported steep drops in the condition of the 
crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat moved higher in step with corn and soybeans.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 3 1/4 cents to $2.91 a bushel;  
December corn rose 4 cents to $2.34 3/4 a bushel; December oats rose 
1 1/2 cents to $1.18 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans rose 14 1/2 cents to 
$4.93 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and lean hog futures were higher on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while pork bellies were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle rose .38 cent to 64.65 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .15 cent to 76.47 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs rose .82 cent to 50.52 cents a pound; August pork bellies rose 
2.28 cents to 61.90 cents a pound, while other contract months 
retreated.

<HEADLINE> Van Gogh Drawing Returned to Heir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- German officials returned a van Gogh drawing and  
two other pieces of art on Wednesday to the heir of a Jewish 
collector forced by the Nazis to sell the works for a fraction of 
their true value. 
</P>
<P>
	The van Gogh drawing, titled ``Olive Trees,'' has been in Berlin  
museums since 1935, the year the original owner, Max Silberberg, 
was forced to auction off his collection. 
</P>
<P>
	The drawing and two other pieces were the first from  
Silberberg's extensive collection returned to his only surviving 
heir, daughter-in-law Gerta Silberberg, now 85 and living in 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	``The return of these artistic and valuable drawings can send a  
signal'' for future returns of Jewish property, said Karl Brozik, 
director of the Conference of Jewish Material Claims against 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The Claims Conference, which identified the van Gogh drawing in  
1997, has found at least 1,000 more pieces of art in former 
communist nations that were looted by the Nazis from Jewish owners. 
About half are in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Silberberg, a factory owner in what was then Breslau,  
present-day Wroclaw in Poland, was forced to sell his art 
collection, house and eventually his factory. 
</P>
<P>
	The art alone would be valued at $60 million today, said Konrad  
Matschke, a Claims Conference spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an important collection of Impressionist and  
Expressionist art, including works by Cezanne and Pisarro,'' 
Matschke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more paintings from the Silberberg collection have been  
identified, one in the United States and one in Russia, Matschke 
said. Terms for a handover, however, have not been reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Returned with the van Gogh were two other pieces: a drawing by  
Caspar David Friedrich seized by the Nazis from Silberberg in 1940 
and a painting by Hans von Marees sold at the same 1935 auction. 
The painting is being loaned for an exhibit in Bremen. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the van Gogh, the other pieces had been in museums in  
Berlin and neighboring Brandenburg states under control of the 
Foundation for Prussian Cultural Collections. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerta Silberberg and her husband, Alfred, emigrated to Great  
Britain ``under difficult circumstances'' in 1937. Max Silberberg 
remained in Silesia and later died in a concentration camp.

<HEADLINE> McNown Joins Bears at Training Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLATTEVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- Forget all those records Cade McNown  
set at UCLA. Never mind those two fourth-quarter touchdown drives 
against Stanford or that 24-point rally in the last 17 minutes 
against Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
	The way McNown sees it, everything starts over in the NFL.  
</P>
<P>
	``The college part of my life is over. Most of the people in  
Chicago, most of the people around the country, haven't seen me 
play. I'm looking to make an impact with the Bears, and I'm 
starting now,'' he said Tuesday after practicing with the Chicago 
Bears for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	As far as first impressions go, the rookie did pretty well. His  
passes were quick and strong, and he probably could have gone deep 
if his receivers weren't in their 12th day of training camp. 
Instead of getting flustered or confused, he looked as if he'd been 
running the Bears' offense for weeks rather than minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	And when the coaches decided to use him in the goal-line drills,  
McNown's first pass went for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came in, stepped right in and did what he had to do,''  
receiver Curtis Conway said. ``He's a big-play quarterback that 
will make plays. He kind of reminds me of a young Brett Favre 
because he's smart and he's chancy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears hope McNown will be just as successful as Favre, too.  
After making him the 12th pick in the draft, Chicago signed McNown 
to a contract that could pay him up to $22 million over five years. 
The initial deal, signed Monday, is for seven years and $15 
million, but there are two voidable years and the possibility of an 
additional $7 million in incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he arrived at training camp about a week and a half after  
his teammates, missing the heat and humidity that made life almost 
unbearable last week, McNown got a warm welcome in the locker room 
Tuesday morning. Teammates were quick to say hello, and coach Dick 
Jauron stopped by to say he was happy to see him. 
</P>
<P>
	As he left the field after his first practice, he walked with  
Shane Matthews, whose time as the Bears' No. 1 quarterback is now 
almost done. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like I'm trying to come out here and prove something  
right away,'' McNown said. ``I just need to learn, and everybody 
knows that. I think most of these guys are concerned with bettering 
themselves. They're not thinking about me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNown can take some of the credit for his warm-and-fuzzy  
welcome. When Curtis Enis arrived at camp last year after his 
holdout, he was out of shape and way behind, and it took weeks for 
him to learn the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown, on the other hand, hired a personal trainer and worked  
out twice a day. He studied his playbook, memorizing what of the 
offense he learned during minicamps. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very confident person, I think everybody sees that,''  
quarterbacks coach John Shoop said. ``He wants to take every rep. 
He just showed up today, but he'd have taken every single rep if we 
put him in for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNown isn't expected to play in Saturday's exhibition opener  
against the Indianapolis Colts, but that will probably be the last 
time he spends any significant time on the bench. He may not be 
very big, but he's got a strong arm and more mobility than many 
other quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	More importantly, Jauron said, he's got a great mind.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's gifted physically, but his attitude and his mental  
abilities are what have made him special in college and what we 
hope will make him special here,'' Jauron said. ``He's got a great 
belief in his ability to compete with anybody -- probably in 
anything, I'd guess -- and come out on top. 
</P>
<P>
	``He feels like he can win all the time. That's the kind of guy  
you want in your huddle controlling your offensive football team. 
So we're happy he's here.''

<HEADLINE> Murder Conviction Overturned in Mo. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Ellen Reasonover missed the preschool plays,  
kissing scraped knees and the other joys and tribulations of 
motherhood. Now she's hoping to make up for lost time. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Reasonover, 42, was released from prison Tuesday, one day  
after a federal judge overturned her 1983 murder conviction. She 
said she was eager to renew life with her 18-year-old daughter, 
Charmelle Buford, who was 2 when Ms. Reasonover went to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a dream come true,'' Ms. Reasonover said, crying and  
shaking as she left prison. ``I always kept faith, and I believe 
one day my innocence would be proven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch said Wednesday he  
will not refile charges -- though he still believes Ms. Reasonover 
was involved in the crime -- unless further evidence surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury convicted Ms. Reasonover in 1983 shooting a 19-year-old  
man during a botched robbery attempt at a gas station. She could 
have received the death penalty -- if she had, she probably would 
have already been executed -- but was sentenced to life in prison. 
She would not have been eligible for parole until 2033. 
</P>
<P>
	No witnesses saw her and no fingerprints were found. But when  
she called police with a tip and gave a phony name, she became a 
prime suspect. Then two jail informants supplied key testimony 
against her. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Jean C. Hamilton overturned the conviction  
after a weeklong hearing in which Ms. Reasonover's attorney 
presented new evidence, including a tape-recorded conversation that 
contradicted the testimony of the jailhouse informers.

<HEADLINE> Dow Chemical Awaits Settlement News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Dow Chemical Co. has a big stake in whether a federal judge  
will approve a $3.2 billion settlement for 170,000 women with 
silicone breast implants. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement is part of a $4.5 billion bankruptcy  
reorganization plan for Dow Corning Corp., which is owned 50-50 by 
Dow Chemical and Corning Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Corning filed for bankruptcy court protection from its  
creditors in 1995 after thousands of women sued the company, saying 
their silicone breast implants had caused various health problems. 
The company no longer makes implants. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearings on the plan ended Friday. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur  
Spector, who must rule on whether the plan should take effect, has 
given no indication when such a decision might come. 
</P>
<P>
	Spector said he would focus on one the most contentious parts of  
the settlement -- a provision that bars further lawsuits against Dow 
Chemical and Corning over silicone breast implants. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those objecting to the plan are 49 women with implants  
from Nevada. The Nevada Supreme Court upheld a civil decision 
against Dow Chemical, and lawyers for the women argue the proposed 
settlement unfairly takes away their right to sue. 
</P>
<P>
	A Nevada woman won a $4.2 million verdict against Dow Chemical  
last year, saying the company was liable for her health problems 
because it tested silicone products for Dow Corning in the 1960s. 
Her case, later settled, is the only one of its kind to be upheld 
so far.

<HEADLINE> Recalling Union Carbide's Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Many people know about Union Carbide Corp. only through the  
worst industrial accident ever. 
</P>
<P>
	A subsidiary of Union Carbide operated a chemical plant in  
Bhopal, India, which released a deadly cloud of toxic gas the night 
of Dec. 2, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnight, the cloud of methyl isocyanate killed 4,000 people in  
an adjacent shantytown. Thousands more died later from exposure to 
the fumes, a court in Bhopal has ruled. Estimates of the death toll 
in the 15 years since the leak range as high as 15,000; tens of 
thousands more suffer health effects including cataracts, lung 
diseases, cancer and gynecological disorders. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, Danbury, Conn.-based Union Carbide paid $470 million --  
one- twelfth of India's original claim -- in an out-of-court 
settlement that guaranteed immunity from prosecution for company 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indian Supreme Court later struck down the immunity  
provision, while allowing the financial settlement to stand. But 
few victims enjoyed quick access to the money, which was tied up in 
a convoluted claims process. 
</P>
<P>
	Union Carbide has said its investigation of the leak points to  
sabotage by a disgruntled employee. 
</P>
<P>
	Victims and their relatives have sought criminal charges against  
Warren Anderson, who was chairman of Union Carbide at the time of 
the disaster. The Indian government has repeatedly refused to act 
on victims' demands for Anderson's extradition.

<HEADLINE> Stranded Sailors Finally Go Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- After a nearly yearlong ordeal aboard  
a ship stranded off the coasts of Mexico and Texas, Capt. Maqsood 
Ahmed is finally going home, empty-handed but not downhearted. 
</P>
<P>
	He's going to get to see his 2 1/2-year-old daughter, who was 6  
months old when he left Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to pick her up and hug her,'' he said. ``I want to  
see what she looks like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, with the help of charities, Ahmed and four others  
flew to Houston on the first leg of their journey home. They were 
the last of the 23 crew members from the freighter Delta Pride to 
be leaving Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delta Pride was stranded off the coast of Tampico, Mexico,  
beginning in May 1998, because the Pakistani company that owned it 
went bankrupt. A financial dispute with Mexican officials led to 
the seizure of the ship's documents and the crew's passports. 
</P>
<P>
	The seamen lived off rain water and whatever fish they could  
catch, but developed signs of scurvy and had no clean water for 
bathing. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, after Ahmed found a $10 bill in a drawer and was  
inspired by the words ``In God We Trust,'' the desperate crew used 
the last of their fuel to sail the derelict ship 300 miles to the 
Texas coast. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Tuesday that if he had not found that bill, ``I would  
not be alive today. I would have died.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, because of their lack of papers, they sat off the Texas  
coast for several more months. 
</P>
<P>
	The 740-foot freighter was finally auctioned as scrap for  
$300,000. The last crew members came ashore in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The men had been waiting to receive their wages from the auction  
proceeds, but that money is still tied up in legal disputes, so 
they finally decided to go home. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clean-Shaven Earnhardt Gets Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Dale Earnhardt showed up at the Indianapolis  
Motor Speedway on Wednesday with a clean-shaven upper lip. His 
trademark mustache was gone for the first time in 17 years, a 
sacrifice to his determination not to be beaten -- at anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael (Waltrip) made me shave it off,'' Earnhardt said. ``We  
were down in the Bahamas on Saturday, snorkeling, and he was 
getting down deeper than I was. I was drowning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bushy lip, it turned out, prevented a tight seal between his  
mask and his face. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to do something to get down there with him. I had to  
shave so I could get deeper. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it'll affect any of my racing skills,'' he said.  
``It didn't in '82, anyway. We still won races.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Practice for the fourth and final round of this year's  
International Race of Champions series began on Wednesday. 
Earnhardt won each of the first three races and on Friday could 
become the first driver to sweep all four races since the series 
began in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Practice and qualifications for Saturday's Brickyard 400 Winston  
Cup race will begin on Thursday. Earnhardt, the 1995 Brickyard 
winner, has won only one race this season and is seventh in series 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've qualified pretty good and raced pretty good in the last  
several races,'' Earnhardt said. ``I want to be up front racing. 
That strategy of racing for the top five and racing for the win is 
where everybody wants to be. It seems like our program is going 
that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Gordon, who turned 28 on Wednesday, became the first  
two-time Brickyard winner last year and is just ahead of Earnhardt 
in sixth place in the season standings. The leader is Dale Jarrett, 
who has won three races and has used consistent finishes to build a 
254-point lead over Mark Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's race on the 2 1/2-mile, low-banked Speedway oval is the  
20th of the 34 Winston Cup races this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This race track is a track that anything can happen at,''  
Earnhardt said. ``Guys had trouble here and lost races, guys had 
great pit stops and won races, like we did in '95. And gas mileage 
has won races, like Ricky Rudd (in 1997). 
</P>
<P>
	``Strategy plays out at the end. ... It could come down to that  
one last stop and whether you take tires or not, whether you just 
take a little gas or what.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt also was the 1990 and 1995 IROC champion. Among the 11  
other drivers in this year's series is his son, Dale Jr., who lost 
to his father by .007 second in the last race at Michigan Speedway 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Others in IROC this year are Gordon, Martin, Jarrett, Rusty  
Wallace, Bobby Labonte and Jeff Burton from NASCAR; Eddie Cheever 
and 1999 Indy 500 winner Kenny Brack from the Indy Racing League; 
and Adrian Fernandez and Greg Moore from Championship Auto Racing 
Teams. All drivers are in identically prepared IROC cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, the 1995 Indy Lights champion and fifth in the CART  
series last season, hit the second-turn wall early in Wednesday's 
IROC practice. He was not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unique to race in IROC,'' the elder Earnhardt said. ``To  
win is also great. To come in and win three races already this year 
and maybe set a record by winning four is pretty unique. But guys 
like Mark Martin, Rusty Wallace and these guys are not wanting that 
to happen. Then my kid's in there, aggravating the hell out of 
me.''

<HEADLINE> Sega, AT&AMP;T Unveil Dreamcast Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Owners of Sega's long-awaited Dreamcast  
video game console will be able to challenge gamers across the 
street or across the country, using a built-in modem and AT&AMP;T 
Corp.'s Internet service 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T and Sega announced a deal Wednesday making AT&AMP;T the  
preferred partner for hooking Dreamcast to the Internet. However 
those who are already online using a different Internet service 
provider will also be able to connect to the Sega Dreamcast 
Network. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dreamcast and its built-in 56k modem will list for $199.99  
when it is released domestically on Sept. 9. Sega says 200,000 
consoles have already been pre-sold in the U.S., the strongest 
launch ever for a video game console. Sega has sold more than 1 
million units in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Users of the Sega Network Web site will also have access to chat  
rooms, bulletin boards and e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds like a good vote of confidence for Dreamcast from  
AT&AMP;T,'' said analyst Sean McGowan of Gerard Klauer Mattison in New 
York. ``It's a good way for AT&AMP;T to get into Internet gaming 
without a large capital investment.''

<HEADLINE> Japan, S. Korea Hold Naval Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- In what is seen as a countermeasure to  
growing military threats from North Korea, longtime rivals Japan 
and South Korea held a joint naval exercise today for the third 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	The drill, the first joint military exercise between the two  
countries, was conducted amid fear that North Korea is preparing to 
test a long-range ballistic missile. The reclusive regime 
test-fired a missile last August that flew over Japan and landed in 
the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-day exercise, a mock search and rescue of a wrecked  
civilian vessel in international waters, is being held in the East 
China Sea between Japan's southwestern island of Kyushu and South 
Korea's Cheju Island, off the southwestern coast, the Defense 
Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The drill involves a destroyer, an escort vessel and a  
helicopter from South Korea, and three destroyers, one patrol plane 
and three helicopters from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry emphasized that the exercise, involving 1,200 South  
Korean and Japanese sailors, was for peaceful purposes. It blocked 
media coverage, however, saying it did not want to provoke North 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	The North denounced the exercise, insisting it was aimed at  
starting a war. 
</P>
<P>
	``The exercise is ... aggressive and criminal in its nature,''  
the North's official Korean Central News Agency said Tuesday. It 
added that the maneuver was targeted at the North ``under the 
simulated conditions of a real war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We will never tolerate (those) who are persisting in such  
military actions. If they finally provoke a war against the DPRK 
while staging the reckless military exercise, they will have to pay 
dearly for it and suffer a miserable defeat,'' the news agency 
said. North Korea refers to itself as the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea, or DPRK. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense ministers of the two nations agreed to conduct the  
exercise when they met in Tokyo last September to discuss security 
issues, spurred in part by North Korea's firing of a missile in 
August over Japan into the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	The North says it put a scientific satellite into orbit, but  
Western officials said the launch was a test-firing of a Taepodong 
I missile that could strike anywhere in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has accused North Korea of preparing to  
test-launch another missile, reportedly a Taepodong II missile with 
a range of up to 3,700 miles, which could reach as far as Hawaii 
and Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, a spokesman for North Korea's Foreign Ministry  
warned it would test-fire a missile if the United States stepped up 
pressure on the isolated communist state. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came shortly after U.S. Defense Secretary William  
Cohen's visit last week to Japan and South Korea, where he urged 
the North to postpone its missile launch or face further economic 
and diplomatic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite prospering economic ties, Japan and South Korea have had  
little military exchanges because of their turbulent history. Japan 
ruled the Korean peninsula as a colony in 1910-1945, and distrust 
and animosity still run deep among the people of both countries.

<HEADLINE> Ratings Good in Woods-Duval Showdown  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The overhyped matchup between Tiger Woods and  
David Duval exceeded expectations with its television ratings. 
Still, don't expect other networks to follow ABC's lead. 
</P>
<P>
	While Woods' victory in the prime-time match-play exhibition,  
shown from 8-11 p.m. EDT, posted a 6.9 national rating and a 12 
share, the PGA Tour won't be sanctioning too many made-for-TV 
events in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought it would be a good idea on a limited basis,'' said  
Ed Moorhouse, PGA Tour senior vice president. ``But we wouldn't 
want to do it too frequently. It's takes some of the attention away 
from the official events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Woods would almost certainly have to be involved in order  
to captivate a national prime-time audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to overdo it,'' said Barry Frank of IMG, which  
represents both players and organized the event. ``But we have to 
see what the players want to do. The plan, if we do another, would 
be to do one next summer. It's a good event once a year, and let's 
just leave it at that. But we'd have to do it live during the 
summer on the West coast, or Hawaii, because of the time 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Woods-Duval matchup's rating was higher than the final  
rounds of the British Open (4.8), PGA Championships (5.7) and the 
U.S. Open (6.8), but fell well short of the final round of the 
Masters (10.1). 
</P>
<P>
	However, all of the major golf tournaments are played during  
daytime, when it is more difficult to attract viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Many industry experts, including the ABC brass, predicted a  
rating in the 5s for the Woods-Duval showcase. The show peaked from 
10:30 p.m. to 11 p.m. with a 8.2 mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't compare this to anything, since it hasn't been done  
before,'' said ABC spokesman Mark Mandel. ``What it means for the 
future, we still don't know. We're very happy with our telecast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The national rating for the event was comparable to NFL  
preseason games in prime time. For example, the Dallas-Jacksonville 
game on CBS in 1998 had a 6.5 rating while the Cowboys' matchup 
with New England earned a 7.9. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of TV households in the United  
States tuned to a program, and each point represents 994,000 homes. 
The share is the percentage tuned to a program among televisions in 
use at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods earned $1.1 million for the victory in the match, which  
ended under temporary floodlights set up at Sherwood Country Club. 
Duval was guaranteed a $400,000 losers share. Each donated $200,000 
to charity. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most difficult challenges ABC faced with the match  
was to maintain viewer interest in between the golfers' shots. That 
meant filling a lot of air time with taped interviews and had 
co-host Al Michaels, making his network golf debut, going into 
great detail about things like the Met Life Snoopy II Blimp. 
</P>
<P>
	The casual viewer who knew little about Woods and Duval was able  
to get plenty of information from features and profiles between the 
shots and commercials. The avid golf fan, however, really didn't 
see or hear anything unique. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC had wanted to mike Woods and Duval to get viewers closer to  
the personalities of the world's top two players. The PGA Tour 
nixed the idea because it violated tour rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't think it would be a problem since players have been  
miked for 18 years in the Skins Game,'' Frank said. ``Both players 
wanted to be miked. It was just an exhibition and wasn't for the 
championship of the world. It would have been more entertaining if 
they had been miked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC did pick up some audio from the golfers, but neither player  
really seemed to do much talking.

<HEADLINE> E-Commerce Means Business' Savings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Cisco Systems saved $250 million last  
year distributing software to its business customers over the 
Internet. U.S. banks saved $18 billion with online transactions. 
General Electric has lowered supplier costs by using online 
auctions. 
</P>
<P>
	The savings provided by e-commerce are starting to add up.  
</P>
<P>
	A new study being released Thursday by Giga Information Group  
predicts that corporations around the world will save up to $1.25 
trillion -- close to France's entire gross domestic product -- doing 
business over the Internet by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Those savings range from reducing the amount of people it takes  
to process a sales request to making it easier and less expensive 
to order office supplies online. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything we do here is Internet business,'' said Cisco  
executive vice president Don Listwin. 
</P>
<P>
	That's partly because Cisco's customers are all companies that  
want to do business online. But Cisco also practices what it sells, 
conducting its own in-house business online as well. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Cisco employees sign up for benefits online. Eighty  
percent of technical inquiries from customers are handled online. 
The company saved $8 million last year by recruiting and accepting 
job applications online. 
</P>
<P>
	Listwin said the paperless transactions that save money for  
Cisco and its customers are easily transferable to most other 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have anything that's unique, that the market can't  
generally get at,'' he said. ``What's unique is that our corporate 
culture accepts that we are conducting business online.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Brown, director of marketing for Inktomi Corp., which  
creates search engines for Internet companies such as Yahoo! Inc., 
said the company Web site saves them money by allowing potential 
customers to review marketing information online. 
</P>
<P>
	``People championing our products at their company are armed  
with white papers, diagrams and demos they can show their 
management team,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet analysts at Giga say that just as the telephone  
affected more than communications and jet airplanes affected more 
than travel, the Internet will continue to drive significant 
changes in the way industrialized nations do business. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet is more than just a new way to sell products and  
services, it's a way to efficiently run a business, resulting in 
significant cost savings that add to an organization's bottom 
line,'' said Andrew Bartels, a Giga vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Bartels said that for the most part, the savings are business to  
business, on internal processes, finances, procurement or human 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
	Money that companies save from changing their business ways is  
often reinvested internally, helping pay for the Internet 
programmers and establish the infrastructure that allows the 
companies to conduct e-commerce effectively. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases the savings are trickling down to consumers who  
can find some lower prices online, Bartels said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Internet sales are just the tip of the iceberg of economic  
value that companies can derive from e-commerce,'' he added. 
``Companies should consider e-commerce as more than a way to sell 
products or services, they should focus at least as much attention 
on the business efficiencies and cost-savings opportunities 
presented by the Internet and related technologies.''

<HEADLINE> Kipketer, Jones Lead Herculis Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) -- Wilson Kipketer and Marion Jones  
showed why they are favorites to win the $1 million Golden League 
jackpot with convincing wins at the Herculis track and field meet 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gabriela Szabo and Bernard Barmasai also won their races to stay  
in contention for the end-of-the-season prize. 
</P>
<P>
	Kipketer is storming back to form after a bout of malaria.  
</P>
<P>
	After one lap of the 800-meter race, he trailed the leaders by  
five meters. But with 200 meters to go, the Kenyan-born runner was 
on the shoulder of leader David Kiptoo, then put on a finishing 
spring that gave him a five-yard victory in one minute, 42.57 
seconds -- the best time of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Kipketer, the world record holder in the event, played down the  
possibility of winning the Golden League jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody talks about how much money I can win this season,  
but they forget I have to work for it,'' he said. ``I am like 
everyone else who works for his salary. I can't go after the money 
without doing the job. I was pleased with my race; it is getting 
better all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones didn't win as easily as usual -- she was 0.11 seconds ahead  
of fellow American Inger Miller -- but did enough to extend her 
winning streak to 19 races. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing is to get a win. A lot of athletes  
don't get the recognition they deserve and they really pushed me 
today,'' the 23-year-old said. 
</P>
<P>
	Szabo ran a brilliant 3,000-meter race.  
</P>
<P>
	The tiny blond, paced by compatriot Luminita Gogirlea, took the  
lead with 1,000 meters to go, accompanied by four other runners, 
including Portugal's Olympic 10,000-meter champion Fernanda Ribeiro 
and Russia's Mariya Pantyukhova. 
</P>
<P>
	All five runners were still tightly grouped when Szabo began her  
sprint with 200 yards to go, winning in 8 minutes, 28.36 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden League series jackpot is shared by those athletes who  
win the same event in all seven meets. Szabo -- the 5,000-meter 
world champion -- has now won all four 3,000-meter races. 
</P>
<P>
	Barmasai also won his fourth straight steeplechase.  
</P>
<P>
	Two laps from the end, the 25-year-old world record holder had  
established a 40-meter lead. He finished 80 meters in front in 
7:58.99 and has now won all seven of his 3,000-meter steeplechases 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	In a quick 200-meter race, Maurice Greene clocked his fastest  
time of the year, 19.92, to hold off a challenge from Frankie 
Fredericks, who was one hundredth of a second behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Obadele Thompson was third in 20.11.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is my first time under 20 seconds this year, so I am glad.  
After all the good training I have done, it comes together by 
itself,'' Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
	Romania's Violeta Szekely, who got a late start to the season  
after falling down stairs and fracturing an ankle, won the 1,500 
meters in 4:01.49 -- the fastest time of the year. Szekely caught 
Switzerland's Anita Weyermann right at the tape. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's 400 meters, reigning world champion Cathy Freeman  
of Australia beat off the challenge of last year's world No. 1, 
Nigeria's Falilatu Ogunkoya.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Says He Hasn't Taken Andro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire, adamant in spring training that  
he would keep taking androstenedione, disclosed Wednesday he has 
not used the over-the-counter dietary supplement for four months. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire made the revelation before his St. Louis Cardinals  
played the San Diego Padres. Hours later, he hit his 499th career 
home run and 42nd of the season, tying Sammy Sosa for the major 
league lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought long and hard about it and I don't like the way it  
was portrayed like I was the endorser of the product, which I 
wasn't,'' McGwire said. ``I don't like how it's portrayed, but 
young kids take it because of me. I don't like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire said the fact his record 70-homer season in 1998 was  
linked to andro, a testosterone booster, likely encouraged 
youngsters to try it. That was perhaps the biggest reason for his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I discourage young people from taking it,'' he said. ``If  
you're old enough and you have your own mind, you can do whatever 
you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Androstenedione is metabolized into testosterone, which is  
considered a steroid. It is banned by the Olympics, the NCAA, the 
NFL, and the men's and women's tennis tours though it is permitted 
in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's admission that he used andro sparked a tenfold  
increase in sales of the supplement last fall, much of it through 
the Internet, and led many steroid experts to warn of serious 
health consequences for teen-agers who take it to emulate McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball has commissioned a study of andro by  
Harvard scientists. No decision is expected until later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, McGwire acknowledged to The Associated Press that  
he had used andro for more than a year. Colorado's Dante Bichette 
was among a group of other players who said they took it. 
</P>
<P>
	As spring training opened this year, McGwire said andro was  
legal and that it had ``absolutely nothing to do with me hitting a 
baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said then he took it to get through late-season workouts.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't endorse the product and I never did,'' he said then.  
``Someone stuck their nose in my locker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's recent statistics appear to show that he's fine  
without andro. Including Wednesday's shot, he has homered 15 times 
in 19 games.

<HEADLINE> Removing Predators Has Consequences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	House cats and other small animals are becoming the dominant  
predators in many of San Diego's rugged canyons, replacing wild 
coyotes that were driven away by urban development, according to a 
new study. 
</P>
<P>
	Because cats, opossums, skunks and raccoons are no longer preyed  
on, they are free to eat more rodents and birds, threatening their 
populations, said biologist Kevin Crooks, co-author of the study in 
Thursday's journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	``Predators like coyotes are often persecuted by humans, but  
they can have important ecological roles,'' Crooks said. 
``Sometimes you can't predict what kind of roles they play until 
they disappear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For two years, Crooks and his colleagues surveyed about 30 of  
San Diego's rugged canyons that are rural oases in the sea of the 
city's urban expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	They found that where coyotes still live, dead felines were  
found in most of those areas and 21 percent of coyote droppings 
contained cat remains. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the coyote threat disappears, more felines are allowed  
to roam and hunt on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one has really looked at this particular relationship  
before,'' said Lee McClenaghan, professor of biology at San Diego 
State University. ``It shows if you destroy habitat and remove 
components of an ecosystem, effects are seen throughout.''

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Nomination Clears Hurdle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After 14 months, the Senate moved closer  
Wednesday to confirming Richard Holbrooke as U.N. ambassador when 
the final senator blocking the nomination lifted his objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa., said he would fight an unrelated  
battle with the State Department in other ways, calling it ``not a 
personal dispute'' with Holbrooke. ``I intend to vote for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That removed the final obstacle to a Senate vote confirming  
President Clinton's nomination of the veteran diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
	But it created new problems for other diplomatic nominees.  
Grassley said he instead would block three other pending 
nominations, including that of Peter Burleigh as ambassador to the 
Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
	Burleigh has been filling in for Holbrooke at the United Nations  
since last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from both parties said they expected the combative  
Balkans negotiator to be confirmed overwhelmingly with only brief 
floor debate -- despite the long delays and problems that have 
dogged him until now. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke, an investment banker, is a former ambassador to  
Germany and was architect of the 1995 accord that ended the war in 
Bosnia. He also has served as Clinton's special envoy in the Kosovo 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton announced the nomination in June 1998. But it quickly  
became tangled, first in internal Justice and State Department 
investigations into Holbrooke's contacts with former State 
Department colleagues and then in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley announced he was releasing a ``hold'' that had  
prevented a Senate vote on Holbrooke. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Grassley said he was transferring the delaying tactics  
to three other ambassadorial appointments. 
</P>
<P>
	Three others had also sought to block the nomination -- Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, and Sen. 
George Voinovich, R-Ohio -- but they earlier abandoned the tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Senate tradition, any member without explanation may block  
action on legislation or a nomination for as long as the majority 
leader permits. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley used the technique to protest the State Department's  
treatment of a whistleblower, Linda Shenwick. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley said that the dispute continues but that he no longer  
wants to hold up the long-delayed Holbrooke nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he said he was switching his ``holds'' to Burleigh and  
two other nominees: Carl Spielvogel to be ambassador to the Slovak 
Republic and Richard Fredericks to be ambassador to Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley contends that Shenwick, who worked at the U.N. mission  
in New York, was demoted and transferred to a lesser job in 
Washington in retaliation for her telling members of Congress about 
waste and inefficiency at the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department has said Shenwick was reassigned because of  
unsatisfactory job performance, not because she was a 
whistleblower. 
</P>
<P>
	``My interest in this matter is very simple,'' Grassley said.  
``Congress cannot function as an institution if government 
employees cannot communicate with Congress about wrongdoing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The executive branch should not be allowed to shoot the  
messenger,'' he said. He said he wanted to make sure ``the process 
for Ms. Shenwick remains fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley also said he had taken ``additional steps which I  
choose not to disclose at this time. They are designed to increase 
my and other interested colleagues' ability to insist that Ms. 
Shenwick be treated fairly.''

<HEADLINE> Spielberg Getting Award From Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- He has won countless awards as a filmmaker.  
Now Steven Spielberg is being feted for his humanitarian works. 
</P>
<P>
	The man behind films including ``Schindler's List'' and ``Saving  
Private Ryan'' will be awarded the James Smithson Bicentennial 
Medal by The Smithsonian Associates at an Aug. 11 ceremony in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Smithsonian Institution, composed of museums, galleries and  
research facilities, was established in 1846 with money bequeathed 
to the United States by Smithson, a British scientist. 
</P>
<P>
	The award in his name is given each year to individuals who have  
made contributions to areas of interest to the Smithsonian. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am both surprised and deeply honored to be designated for  
such a prestigious medal from an institution that is a national and 
international treasure,'' Spielberg said in a statement released by 
the Smithsonian. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to film credits, Spielberg has established the  
Righteous Persons Foundation, a grant-making organization dedicated 
to strengthening Jewish life. He also established Survivors of the 
Shoah Visual History Foundation in order to preserve the personal 
stories of survivors, and through them the victims, of the 
Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	Past award recipients include the late ocean explorer Jacques  
Cousteau, former first lady Lady Bird Johnson, filmmaker George 
Lucas and television newsman Walter Cronkite.

<HEADLINE> 'Canes, Primeau Still at Stalemate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- There has been no movement on a new  
contract for Carolina Hurricanes captain Keith Primeau as the start 
of training camp looms a month away. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest offer to the all-star center this week was rejected  
by agent Don Reynolds. The Carolina offer to the restricted free 
agent was believed to have been a five-year package averaging $4 
million a season. Primeau made $2 million last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The sides have not talked face-to-face or on the telephone in  
more than a month. The latest offer was rejected by fax. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a game to be playing cat-and-mouse at this  
point,'' Carolina general manager Jim Rutherford said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds has refused to say what Primeau, 27, is seeking, but it  
is believed to be more than the $5 million a year teammate Ron 
Francis received as an unrestricted free agent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing I've learned in this process based on some of  
the comments is it looks like I'm not supposed to sign any free 
agents -- like Ronnie Francis,'' Rutherford said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That has been held against me, `Well, if Ronnie Francis got  
this I should get this too.' Well, if that's the case then I should 
tell the players in training camp I'm not going to try to improve 
the team. I don't think that is a fair bargaining chip, but I've 
heard that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-5, 220-pound Primeau, who scored a team-leading 30  
goals last season, could have filed for salary arbitration by July 
15, but elected not to. Now, his leverage is to hold out. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds said Wednesday that Primeau is the sixth or seventh  
best center in the NHL, and should be paid accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
	``He brings as much to the table as any center in the league,''  
Reynolds said. ``Is he the top guy? No, he's not the top guy, but 
he's got to be coming up next after the first few centers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If that's the case, Rutherford insisted Primeau should have  
filed for arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Reynolds) should have told an arbitrator that,''  
Rutherford said. ``That seems to me it would have been the fairest 
way to resolve this. Whether he's right or wrong where he has Keith 
slotted, it doesn't matter, Keith is now going to be slotted into 
our payroll and our structure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Primeau has 406 career points in 597 games. However, he has been  
a major disappointment during the postseason, scoring only six 
goals in 70 career playoff games with Detroit and Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Rutherford said he would welcome Primeau to training camp Sept.  
5 even if he's not signed. Two unsigned players came to camp last 
year -- defensemen Nolan Pratt and Steve Halko -- and both were 
signed within a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most teams in the NHL have a policy that unsigned players  
can't come to training camp. That is not our policy,'' said 
Rutherford. ``I feel that when a player does sign he has to be 
ready to play. To tell a player not to come to camp and keep up 
conditioning on his own I don't think is fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a restricted free agent, Carolina has the right to match any  
offer for Primeau or risk losing him for a series of No. 1 draft 
picks. So far, no team has given Primeau a contract offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Rutherford also said he has fielded no trade offers for his star  
center.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Backs Gore 100 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAMESTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton said Wednesday  
that Vice President Al Gore is ``the best partner any president has 
ever had'' and that she will do whatever she can to support his bid 
for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could not be more strongly in support of his campaign and  
the kind of president he would be for this country,'' Mrs. Clinton 
said during a campaign stop in Jamestown. The first lady is 
exploring a possible run for the Democratic Senate nomination in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will do whatever I can in whatever way is open to me in  
supporting his candidacy because I truly believe he would be the 
best person we could have to lead our country into this new 
century,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she was ``absolutely 100 percent behind the vice  
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A statewide poll released this week by the Quinnipiac College  
Polling Institute showed Gore leading his only Democratic opponent, 
Bill Bradley. But in one-on-one matchups with the Republican 
front-runner, George W. Bush, Gore was in a statistical dead heat 
with the Texas governor while Bradley was ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	New York is considered a must-win state for the Democrats if  
they are to retain the White House.

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Makes Comeback in Minors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Before Darryl Strawberry headed back to  
the minors he got a pointed message from Yankees owner George 
Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me, `Don't screw up again,''' Strawberry said. ``I  
said, `I won't.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, attempting to come back from his latest drug  
suspension -- while still recovering from colon cancer surgery -- has 
been given another chance by Yankees management to return to The 
Bronx if he can turn his life around. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in the starting lineup for Triple-A Columbus Wednesday  
night, playing for the first time since learning he had colon 
cancer last Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of fans along the third baseline gave Strawberry a  
standing ovation when he left on the on-deck circle for his first 
at-bat in the second inning. They cheered even louder when he 
singled sharply to center on Jose Bautista's second pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	A smattering of boos was also heard. Columbus, after all, is  
home to many Cleveland Indians fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry went 2-for-4, but failed to come through with the  
game on the line in the ninth. He got jammed and popped out to 
third to end it with the tying run on second as the Clippers lost 
3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a matter of time, a matter of getting back,''  
Strawberry said. ``You know that's the first time I've faced game 
situation pitches. All I did down in Tampa was just hit, run and 
shag balls. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be in a live situation and seeing breaking balls, I felt a  
little rusty. ... You need to get at least 15 to 20 at-bats before 
you really start feeling good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry singled to right in the fifth and stole second  
despite a poor jump when the throw from Norfolk catcher Mandy 
Romero skipped into center field. 
</P>
<P>
	He looked overmatched in the fourth when Bautista blew strike  
three past him. He walked on four pitches in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry said he was overanxious at the plate in the ninth.  
</P>
<P>
	``It could have ended better than it did,'' he said. ``In a  
situation like that I've got a right-hand hitter on deck and I've 
got to be a lot smarter than that and not chase bad pitchers. I 
chased two bad pitches trying to probably do too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, Strawberry said he doesn't plan to let this  
opportunity slip by, admitting this will be his final comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll tell you right now, if I have to go through this again,  
I'll never return to baseball. ... The most important thing is that 
I care about me instead of putting pressure on myself to prove 
myself,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the most important thing for right now is to deal with  
my addiction and recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry was suspended 120 days by commissioner Bud Selig  
after his arrest on solicitation and drug charges April 14. Selig 
reduced the suspension by one week on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry said he was going through a tough time when he was  
arrested, depressed about not making the Yankees' Opening Day 
roster, and he had stopped going to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he became overwhelmed with trying to get in shape to  
play baseball, finish up six months of chemotherapy and stay on top 
of his rehab. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone that suffers through cancer and has to take  
chemotherapy for six months, somewhere down the line there's going 
to be a wall hit,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really wish I would have paid more attention to my health  
than concerning myself with getting back on the baseball field. My 
life is more important than getting back on the baseball field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel bad that I let down first of all my wife and my two  
children, but also myself and Mr. Steinbrenner and the entire New 
York Yankees,'' Strawberry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clippers' manager Trey Hillman had Strawberry batting cleanup at  
designated hitter, but said he could play left field Thursday 
depending on how he feels. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to do something that will set him back two or  
three days,'' Hillman said. ``He hasn't done this since April. 
There's going to be a little doubt how his body will recover. We're 
not sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Where Strawberry plays once he gets back to New York remains  
undecided. An injured left knee will make it tough for him to play 
left field regularly, and Chili Davis is firmly entrenched at DH. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's no doubt the Yankees could use his bat. Strawberry  
hit 24 homers in 295 at-bats last year before being diagnosed with 
colon cancer. The Yankees current left-field platoon of Shane 
Spencer, Ricky Ledee and Chad Curtis has 14 homers in 384 at-bats 
heading into Wednesday's game with Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry said he doesn't have a timetable for returning to New  
York and won't demand playing time from manager Joe Torre. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not looking to go up there to say I'm the left-fielder and  
I should play,'' he said. ``If I have to go sit on the bench, 
that's what I have to do. If I don't get back there this year, I 
just don't get back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry previously played with Columbus in 1995 after signing  
as a free agent, in 1996 after he left the St. Paul Saints of the 
Northern League, and on an injury rehabilitation in 1997.

<P>
	``I was in a very bad place as far as the way I was thinking,''  
he told The Post. ``Everything was real complicated and I had a 
tough time thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry said he became depressed when he was told he wouldn't  
be on the Yankees' Opening Day roster, and stopped going to 
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learned again that I am a recovering alcoholic and can't  
miss meetings ever,'' he said. ``I am no different than any other 
alcoholic. If I don't go to meetings, I am going to drink.' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry said he hasn't had a drink since the day he was  
arrested, and is eager to resume his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling good and I'm ready to get on with my life,''  
Strawberry said on Monday. ``I'm starting to get into the frame of 
mind of playing. I'm looking forward to it. I'm ready to get 
going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he prepared to face live pitching for the first time since  
March, Strawberry said he didn't know how long he would be with 
Columbus before he is summoned to The Bronx again. 
</P>
<P>
	``One day at a time, that's the way I look at everything now,''  
he said. ``That's the way I look at life and baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry had a brief chat with Yankees owner George  
Steinbrenner and homered on the last pitch of batting practice to 
wrap up his final workout day in Tampa on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very grateful Mr. Selig has given me the opportunity to  
get back to baseball and just move forward with my life,'' said 
Strawberry. ``The whole situation is behind me now and I just want 
to concentrate on what I have to do on the field. Hopefully, I can 
help the ballclub throughout the remainder of the season.''

	Halle Berry says Hollywood isn't ready for a black leading lady.  
She reached that conclusion after starring in the new HBO movie 
``Introducing Dorothy Dandridge,'' about the first black woman 
nominated for an Oscar as best actress. ``For the last six months, 
I have not been able to find a project that can even compare to the 
role that I've just been able to play, so that's how I'm sure 
there's no place for a black leading lady right now,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Korean IOC Official Mum on Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A powerful South Korean member of the  
International Olympic Committee is ``not too concerned'' about tax 
fraud allegations that have been linked to his son, a spokesman 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first criminal case stemming from the U.S. federal  
investigation into Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter 
Olympics, which has been tainted by alleged influence-peddling. 
</P>
<P>
	A businessman from Utah admitted Tuesday that he had helped John  
Kim, the son of Kim Un-yong, obtain permanent U.S. resident status 
by setting up a sham job at his now-defunct communications company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Kim Un-yong cannot comment until he reviews all the  
details on the case,'' his chief secretary, Baek Sung-il, said in 
Seoul. ``But he is not too concerned about the latest 
development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, an IOC executive member, has denied any wrongdoing in the  
bidding scandal. Critics allege Salt Lake City officials illegally 
tried to influence Olympic delegates into awarding them the 2002 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	The businessman, David E. Simmons, has admitted that he used  
fake contracts and phony invoices to conceal the fact that John 
Kim's salary was being paid by the Salt Lake City Olympic Bid 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim has previously said the money Simmons paid his son was for  
consulting and other services and had nothing to do with the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC official has said any deal between Simmons and the Salt  
Lake City bid committee was kept secret from his family. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake City scandal has never loomed large in South  
Korea, where senior government officials are routinely jailed on 
bribery charges. It has received little coverage in the news media. 
</P>
<P>
	President Kim Dae-jung's office said it was following Kim's case  
but there has been no probe or questioning by the South Korean 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Culture and Tourism Ministry, which oversees  
sports affairs, said they didn't know enough about the case to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's own investigation in March gave Kim Un-yong a ``severe  
warning'' for his conduct, but stopped short of harsher sanctions 
in the inquiry that led to an unprecedented 10 expulsions or 
resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim was a key organizer of the 1988 Seoul Olympics. He is  
president of the South Korean Olympic Committee, the World 
Taekwondo Federation and the General Assembly of International 
Sports Federations. 
</P>
<P>
	He is an influential power broker in the IOC, and has been cited  
as a candidate to replace Juan Antonio Samaranch as IOC chief in 
2001.

<HEADLINE> New Blazer Smith Wants To Win Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Steve Smith, apparently expendable to the  
Atlanta Hawks, seems a perfect fit for the Portland Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith gets a chance to play for a proven winner, whose deep  
roster allows him to lessen the pounding on his aching knees. The 
Blazers, meanwhile, get a veteran scorer who might be the missing 
piece to reaching the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been going to the playoffs, but never got past the second  
round,'' Smith said Wednesday, two days after the Hawks traded him 
and Ed Gray to Portland for Isaiah Rider and Jim Jackson. ``And for 
me, the only thing is to win. That was a place I really wanted to 
go, somewhere where they're committed to winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 30, has averaged 18.6 points a game and nearly 37 minutes  
the past five seasons. That certainly will change next season with 
the Blazers, a team that won the Pacific Division title and 
advanced to the Western Conference finals with loads of talent but 
no dominant leader. The team's top scorer, Rider, averaged fewer 
than 14 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing fewer minutes is just fine with Smith, who hopes to  
extend his contract before the last four years of the deal -- which 
will pay him $36 million -- are up. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after the Blazers announced the trade Monday, they  
finalized the signing of 36-year-old free agent Detlef Schrempf, 
who took Portland's middle-class exception of $4.2 million over two 
years after flatly turning down Seattle's offer to re-sign for one 
year and $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``You look at me and Detlef coming in, you hope you're the two  
pieces that get them over the hump,'' Smith said. ``I'm a veteran 
who's been there, and who's hungry. I think sometimes when you have 
a veteran who's won a championship, you're just going out there and 
playing. I'm very hungry to win a championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of the Blazers talked about putting aside their egos for the  
good of the team last season, but at times the party line didn't 
hold. Point guard Damon Stoudamire grumbled on several occasions 
about not playing more in the fourth quarter, and he was ripped for 
speaking out on the subject during the Western Conference finals 
against San Antonio. And Jackson reportedly got into an argument 
with coach Mike Dunleavy over the same issue after Game 3 of the 
Spurs' four-game sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Smith sees the team as having its priorities in place.  
</P>
<P>
	``When it's time to win, you've got to put your stats aside,''  
he said. ``Everybody who played here last year sacrificed his 
stats. It really impressed me that every guy wanted to win. That's 
what really made me happy to get a chance to come here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, ever diplomatic, said he didn't think the Hawks gave up  
on him because of his surgically repaired knees. He said the team 
``just went in another direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I pretty much can't tell you why it was that they never gave  
me a definitive reason, but I'm just happy to be here,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bills' Wiley Has Charges Dropped </HEADLINE>

<P>
	FREDONIA, N.Y. (AP) -- Buffalo Bills defensive end Marcellus  
Wiley was back in training camp Wednesday after harassment charges 
against him were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiley and his girlfriend filed charges against one another in  
Orchard Park Town Court following a domestic dispute in May, but 
each dropped the charges in court Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were called to their residence in Orchard Park on May 8  
to investigate a domestic dispute between Wiley and Kimberly 
Bartlett, according to police records. 
</P>
<P>
	Bartlett told police she was bitten on the finger and kicked.  
Wiley said he was cut on his cheek and lip during the altercation. 
</P>
<P>
	Each signed a complaint accusing the other of harassment.  
</P>
<P>
	Wiley missed one practice session Tuesday to go to court. He  
refused to comment on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Marine Who Faked Death Buried </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Five years ago, family members of former Marine  
Arthur Bennett stood by as ashes were buried at a veterans' 
cemetery with full military honors. 
</P>
<P>
	No such glory was present Tuesday as services were held again  
for Bennett, a man who faked his death to avoid prosecution on 
sexual assault charges, then committed suicide last month while 
awaiting trial on other counts. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett's $400 casket -- pressed wood covered with blue flannel --  
rested in the 100-degree sunshine for 30 minutes as cemetery and 
mortuary workers waited in vain for any family members to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Given, general manager of Hites Funeral Home, said he had  
talked Monday with Bennett's brother, Scott, and informed other 
members of the family when the burial would be. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scott asked me if we would have a minister at the services and  
I told him no,'' Given recounted. The brother told Given: ``All I 
want is for someone to say `God have mercy on his soul.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Facing a court-martial on charges of sexually assaulting the  
children of fellow Marines in Yuma, Ariz., and Okinawa, Japan, 
Bennett faked his own death in February 1994. Family members turned 
out then to bury the remains of a man found in a burned trailer, a 
man thought to be Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bennett, it turned out, had moved to tiny Hurricane, Utah,  
with his ex-wife and three young daughters, changing his name to 
Joe Benson. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruse was discovered on Halloween 1997 when Bennett was  
arrested on charges of sexually molesting two of his teen-age 
daughters and one of their friends. He pleaded no contest and was 
serving time in Utah when he was transferred to Las Vegas to face 
another Marine court-martial. 
</P>
<P>
	He also faced trial next February on murder and other charges in  
connection with the trailer fire death. The victim has never been 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett hanged himself with a bed sheet in his Clark County  
Detention Center cell July 12, a day before he faced a new 
court-martial here on sexual assault and desertion charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Bennett's brothers, Scott, 39, and David, 41, and his  
mother, Ellen, 67, declined to be responsible for funeral services. 
So did his ex-wife, Amelia, 45. All four face federal conspiracy 
charges over the $300,000 in insurance and benefits paid to the 
family when Bennett was declared dead in the trailer fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marine Corps also refused to be involved in the service.  
Bennett was buried in civilian clothes, according to Given. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxpayers will pick up the $720 tab for the burial.  
</P>
<P>
	``Death does strange things to you,'' said Jean Hites, the  
funeral home owner. ``You're either very angry or very sad. This 
family was very angry, very angry at what he had done to their 
family.''

<HEADLINE> Falcons a Dirty Bird to Anderson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- Jamal Anderson hardly sounds like he's  
close to reporting to the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he couldn't be reached for comment Wednesday, the  
All-Pro running back posted a new message on his web site to 
explain his side of stalled contract negotiations with the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Negotiations are not only NOT completed, I have no intention  
of showing up to training camp until they ARE complete,'' Anderson 
wrote on the site. ``That could be a week. That could be two weeks. 
That could be a month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, who still has a year left on his current contract at  
$2.6 million, wants a five-year deal with an $8 million signing 
bonus. The Falcons have refused to meet his price, saying they 
can't maintain a competitive roster if they devote so much money to 
one player. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I want this to be a done deal,'' Anderson said.  
``No doubt about it, I want to be in camp with my teammates and 
preparing for what should be a tremendous season in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've tried to work within the constraints of the team since  
I'm a team player. It's not just about me. I want to make sure we 
have other quality players and our supporting cast is strong. But 
at the same time, I have to try to get in the realm of what the 
market is for players of my stature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, who set a team record by rushing for 1,846 yards last  
season, said he isn't swayed by big-money contracts handed out in 
recent days, such as rookie quarterback Donovan McNabb's seven-year 
deal with the Philadelphia Eagles that could be worth as much as 
$53 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really only worry about what other running backs are making  
since that's my position,'' Anderson said. ``Jamal Anderson did not 
create the market. I'm just simply benefiting from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dan Reeves said there was no progress in getting Anderson  
to camp. Already, the running back is facing $35,000 in fines -- 
$5,000 per day -- for missing the first week of camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't talked with him,'' Reeves said. ``There have been no  
conversations in the last couple of days.''

<HEADLINE> Barkley Hopes To Stay in Houston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Free agent Charles Barkley says wants to remain  
with the Houston Rockets, and he hopes to have a new contract 
signed within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley said the Los Angeles Lakers, the Seattle Supersonics and  
the Utah Jazz had expressed interest in signing him a couple of 
weeks ago and are still interested. 
</P>
<P>
	``My preference, I want to stay with the Rockets and I hope  
everything works out,'' Barkley told KRIV-TV Tuesday. ``I'm 
flattered that other teams are interested, but I enjoy playing here 
in Houston.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to having talks with officials from the Lakers, the  
Sonics and the Jazz, Barkley said Utah's John Stockton called him. 
</P>
<P>
	``That meant a great deal to me because he's someone I really  
admire and respect. Utah is a very interesting situation for me but 
my preference is to stay with the Rockets,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley is in Houston this week as a defendant in a civil suit  
stemming from a car accident in February 1998.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Driver's Pot Use Caused Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Frank Bedell had been treated for dehydration  
and low blood pressure 12 hours before the worst motor vehicle 
accident in the city's history. The 46-year-old bus driver also had 
recently undergone kidney dialysis. 
</P>
<P>
	His personnel file contained a doctor's note saying Bedell had  
congestive heart disease, a condition that should have disqualified 
him from a commercial license. 
</P>
<P>
	But police said Tuesday the marijuana Bedell used before he got  
behind the wheel of a charter bus was the key cause of the Mother's 
Day crash that killed 22 mostly elderly passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	A 556-page report listed Bedell's drug use as the main factor  
leading to the May 9 crash, saying he was ``impaired'' but not 
providing a more specific explanation. The report was released 
Tuesday, two days after Bedell collapsed at his suburban New 
Orleans home and died of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Marijuana's active ingredient was present in Bedell's body after  
the crash, police said. Authorities estimate he smoked or ingested 
the drug between two and six hours before the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedell was fired from two other bus companies after testing  
positive for marijuana use. Custom Bus Charters officials have said 
they called those companies for Bedell's references, but were never 
told about the positive drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedell's last blood test also detected that he had been taking  
Benadryl, a medication used for allergies. People who take the 
medication are told not to drive because it can cause drowsiness, 
dizziness, blurred vision and confusion. 
</P>
<P>
	The report ruled out other possible causes, such as the bus'  
mechanical condition. Bedell's extensive health problems were 
discussed in detail but not listed as contributing factors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The readings are open for interpretation,'' said Bedell's  
lawyer, Jay Zainey. ``There are no statements that substantiate 
that he was under the influence or acting irrationally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said they do not plan to bring any criminal charges  
in connection with the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, forwarded to prosecutors last week, recommended that  
Bedell be charged with vehicular homicide, first-degree vehicular 
negligent injuring, reckless operation of a vehicle and driving 
while intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedell denied being impaired and told police the accident  
happened when he veered to avoid a car he thought was going to 
cross into his lane. The report concluded there was ``insufficient 
data to determine what effect'' the car had on Bedell. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation discovered Bedell received treatment in a  
hospital emergency room for dehydration and extremely low blood 
pressure 12 hours before the accident. Earlier that day, he 
underwent dialysis. 
</P>
<P>
	The police report on Bedell shows the need for a national  
commercial driver database so bus companies can track drivers' drug 
test histories, said Victor Parra, chief executive officer of the 
United Motorcoach Association, a bus company trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	``He shouldn't have been behind the wheel of any vehicle,''  
Parra said. ``We have peoples' lives at stake and this accident was 
evidence of that.''

<HEADLINE>  Pan Am High Jumper Stripped of Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Did Cuban high jump great Javier  
Sotomayor ingest cocaine, as Pan American Games officials found in 
a drug test? Or was he manipulated, as Cuban officials insist? 
</P>
<P>
	Eduardo de Rose, medical chief for the Pan Am Games committee,  
said Wednesday it made no difference where the cocaine originated 
or why it was taken. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the substance is found in urine, we do not question where  
it came from and the reason for taking it,'' de Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban officials said Sotomayor never took cocaine and charged  
the substance was planted in something he ate or drank. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is such a such a gentleman. To us, it is almost impossible  
he would take this substance,'' said professor Rodrigo Alvarez 
Cambra, director of the orthopedic complex of Cuba. ``He has told 
us he has not taken this substance and we believe his word. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is why we know this is a manipulation in the case of  
Javier Sotomayor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Mario Granda of the Cuban medical group added, ``The man is  
completely innocent and we trust him. He said he has not taken a 
banned substance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban rhetoric aside, Sotomayor, the world indoor and outdoor  
record-holder and the only high jumper to clear 8 feet, will be 
suspended for two years, meaning he is ineligible for this month's 
World Track and Field Championships and next year's Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	His absence will leave the sport without one of its most  
recognizable names. Revered by athletes and fans throughout the 
world until now, Sotomayor has fallen from hero to villain. Instead 
of bringing glory and glamour to Cuba, he has brought shame and 
disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
	It is up to the Cuban federation to suspend Sotomayor. If the  
Cubans do not suspend him, the International Amateur Athletic 
Federation will. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans are expected to appeal the ruling against their most  
respected and popular athlete, who was seen with Cuban leader Fidel 
Castro at a gathering in Matanzas, Cuba, on Tuesday night, honoring 
the country's gold medal-winning baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Wednesday, Sotomayor drove his red Mercedes into his garage  
and closed the door, and met in his home with Cuban sports 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sotomayor case is the biggest drug scandal in track and  
field since Canada's Ben Johnson was suspended and lifted of his 
gold medal after testing positive for an anabolic steroid at the 
1988 Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am shocked. I cannot believe it. I am very surprised and  
upset, because I have great esteem for Sotomayor,'' IAAF president 
Primo Nebiolo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor won his fourth Pan Ams gold in the high jump last  
Friday, the final day of the track and field competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans did not name anyone who might have been responsible  
for causing Sotomayor's positive test. And they said they were not 
taking any special precautions to protect their athletes from 
sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are simply eating what the rest of the athletes are  
eating,'' Granda said. ``We hope those who manipulated these 
results or enhanced these results or altered the results of a 
person who never took this substance will never do this again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Vazquez Rana, president of the Pan American Sports  
Organization, said that in doping cases, his group does not 
differentiate a recreational drug such as cocaine from a 
performance-enhancing substance such as a steroid. 
</P>
<P>
	``To us, it is sanctioned as an infraction,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor was the third athlete, all gold medalists, to test  
positive at these games. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Vezina, goalie for Canada's in-line roller hockey team,  
was caught using Nandrolone, costing the team its gold medal. Juana 
Rosario Arrendel, winner of the women's high jump and the only gold 
medalist from the Dominican Republic at the games so far, was 
stripped of her medal for using stanozolol. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Ray Martinez, a member of Mexico's baseball team,  
refused to take a drug test, which was tantamount to a positive 
test. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor's urine sample showed cocaine in the amount of 200  
parts per million, which would be consistent with a person who uses 
the drug, de Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the discovery of cocaine traces indicates the drug would  
have been taken four to five days before the test. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than that, we would not find it,'' he said. ``When we  
find traces of cocaine ... it shows the ingestion was very 
recent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Granda called Sotomayor a ``complete sports gentleman'' and said  
he was a ``flagbearer for the struggle against doping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``His dignity is much above and beyond any results given in any  
laboratory,'' Granda said. ``He is an innocent man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Granda said Sotomayor's fourth gold medal ``will be in the  
hearts of all Pan Americans who love you and trust you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gold medals now go to Canada's Kwaku Boateng and Mark  
Boswell, who tied for the silver. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor won the 1992 Olympic gold medal, the 1993 and 1997  
world outdoor championships, and the 1989, 1993, 1995 and 1999 
world indoor championships. 
</P>
<P>
	This was another embarrassment to Cuba's team at the Pan Am  
Games. Eight Cubans have left the delegation, including one 
journalist, with sources close to the team saying at least seven 
plan to defect. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor earned his place in sports history by jumping 8 feet  
at San Juan, Puerto Rico, on July 29, 1989. He improved that record 
to 8-0 1/2 at Salamanca, Spain, on July 27, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	He set the world indoor record of 7-11 1/2 on March 4, 1989.  
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor is considered the best high jumper ever -- better than  
Dick Fosbury, better than Valery Brumel, better than John Thomas. 
No one has accomplished more than the 31-year-old Cuban. 
</P>
<P>
	Granda said Sotomayor had been tested in more than 60  
competitions, including eight this year, and never tested positive. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the Winnipeg Convention Center, about 25 protesters  
circled in front of the main entrance, holding signs saying, ``Let 
Cuba Play,'' and ``Pan Am is a sporting event not a political 
event.''

<HEADLINE> Some Chemical Exposure OK for Humans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While adverse health impacts cannot be ruled  
out, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that exposure to 
hormone-disrupting chemicals will produce additional cancers or 
infertility, a scientific panel says. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel of the National Academy of Sciences in a report issued  
Tuesday emphasized that more research was needed about the possible 
harmful effects from exposure to these chemicals known as 
``endocrine disrupters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The academy's 16-member research panel said that while it was  
clear that exposure to the chemicals at high concentrations could 
adversely affect wildlife and human health, ``the extent of harm 
caused ... in concentrations that are common in the environment is 
debated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists and a large number of health experts have  
argued that there was growing evidence that a wide range of 
synthetic chemicals affect estrogen levels and even at low doses 
could lead to cancers, neurological problems and infertility. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the Environmental Protection Agency has directed a  
massive screening of more than 15,000 chemicals to try to determine 
what is the greatest risks from human's exposure to these agents in 
the environment. The screening and tests, which will be conducted 
by industry, is expected to take three or four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Some researchers have cautioned that these compounds at low  
doses over many years may increase breast cancer, a decline in 
sperm counts and reproductive disorders in males. 
</P>
<P>
	But the academy's research committee found as yet no clear link  
between such exposure and these ailments in humans, according to 
the 414-page report. While additional studies were needed, it said 
the current literature did not support an association between 
exposure to low levels of these chemicals and breast cancer or a 
variety of other hormonally sensitive cancers. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel acknowledged that there was evidence of adverse  
reproductive and developmental effects in wildlife and laboratory 
animals because of exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals. 
Again, it said no such link could be determined with current 
research data in humans at exposure levels found generally in the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, the panel agreed there was ample evidence that fetal  
exposure to high doses of these chemicals -- such as exposure to 
high amounts of pesticides in fish or other foods -- had been found 
to hinder nervous system development in humans as well as birds and 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
	But the study said the data on the effects of these chemicals on  
human nervous system development at levels in the environment was 
insufficient to make a definitive conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	In all these areas, the panel said additional studies were  
needed, especially on children whose mothers were exposed to such 
chemical agents during pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Determining the risks to humans from contact with these  
chemicals in the environment is difficult because ordinary exposure 
of these agents has not been routinely monitored,'' said University 
of Texas researcher Ernst Knobil, who was chairman of the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	But several scientists, including a member of the panel,  
interviewed Monday said the data on which the study was based was 
now two years old and that more recent research suggested a closer 
link between endocrine-disrupting chemicals and human health. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a ``plausibility of human harm'' that cannot be  
ignored, Frederick vom Saal, a professor of biological sciences at 
the University of Missouri, said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Vom Saal, who was a member of the research panel, said the  
degree to which there is consensus on the affects of these 
chemicals at the molecular level on wildlife and on laboratory 
animals suggests the likelihood of impact on humans as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter deFur, an environmental biologist at the Virginia  
Commonwealth University who reviewed the report, said more recent 
research not covered by the study implies ``a closer link to human 
health'' impacts than the study suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a tremendous amount of research activity going on a  
number of these questions,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Pan Am High Jumper Stripped of Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Did Cuban high jump great Javier  
Sotomayor ingest cocaine, as Pan American Games officials found in 
a drug test? Or was he manipulated, as Cuban officials insist? 
</P>
<P>
	Eduardo de Rose, medical chief for the Pan Am Games committee,  
said Wednesday it made no difference where the cocaine originated 
or why it was taken. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the substance is found in urine, we do not question where  
it came from and the reason for taking it,'' de Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban officials said Sotomayor never took cocaine and charged  
the substance was planted in something he ate or drank. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is such a such a gentleman. To us, it is almost impossible  
he would take this substance,'' said professor Rodrigo Alvarez 
Cambra, director of the orthopedic complex of Cuba. ``He has told 
us he has not taken this substance and we believe his word. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is why we know this is a manipulation in the case of  
Javier Sotomayor.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Court Asks FCC To Justify Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An appeals court ordered the Federal  
Communications Commission on Tuesday to justify continuing to make 
broadcasters give air time to opposing viewpoints, given the 
skyrocketing growth of other media outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Broadcasters and the  
Radio-Television News Directors Association had asked the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to scrap the 
decades-old rules requiring people be given on-air opportunities to 
respond to personal attacks and political editorials. 
</P>
<P>
	The two groups argued that FCC regulations are unconstitutional  
and are no longer needed given the growth of cable, satellite TV 
and the Internet as sources of news and information. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-judge Court of Appeals panel returned the issue to the  
commission to give it ``an opportunity to provide an adequate 
justification for retaining the rules. The court asked the FCC to 
act quickly, but left open the possibility the commission could 
reconsider or modify the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FCC must therefore explain its rationale for these rules  
in more detail, thereby permitting the court to test that rationale 
against petitioners' factual assertions and, if necessary, the 
demands of the First Amendment,'' the court wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC's political editorial rule requires TV and radio  
stations that endorse a political candidate to notify and give free 
rebuttal time to the candidate's opponent. Stations that oppose a 
candidate must notify and give that candidate free time to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC's personal attack rule requires TV and radio stations  
that assault the honesty, character or integrity of a person or 
group as part of a controversial story to give that person or group 
free rebuttal time. 
</P>
<P>
	Public interest groups contend the rules ensure that the public  
has some access to the airwaves.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Approves New Cancer Drug Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Patients with suspicious chest X-rays are  
getting a new test to help determine if they need a biopsy for lung 
cancer: The government approved a drug Wednesday that can literally 
light up cancerous cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Diatide Inc.'s NeoTect will not replace biopsies in which lung  
tissue is surgically removed to definitively diagnose cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	But because NeoTect works differently than other noninvasive  
cancer tests, ``it is a very valuable tool'' for deciding which 
patients need a biopsy, said Dr. Florence Houn of the Food and Drug 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	About 171,000 Americans will be diagnosed with lung cancer this  
year, and about 159,000 will die, the American Cancer Society 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	NeoTect is for patients whose chest X-rays or CT scans show a  
mass that doctors cannot determine is benign or cancerous. 
Sometimes mere scars, for instance, appear suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
	Many types of lung cancer produce a protein called somatostatin.  
NeoTect is injected into the arm and travels to the lungs, where it 
detects somatostatin by latching onto somatostatin ``receptors,'' 
or docking points, on cancer cells. NeoTect carries a radioactive 
label that lights up the cancer under a common nuclear-medicine 
camera. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other noninvasive tools to help doctors decide who  
needs a biopsy. NeoTect appears as accurate as one well-regarded 
test, the PET scan, said Dr. Neal Rinne of Cigna Healthcare of 
Arizona. But PET scanning equipment is so expensive that in many 
parts of the country, the scans simply aren't available, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NeoTect can be done at a lower cost, and done in small  
towns,'' because it merely requires a common nuclear-medicine 
camera, Rinne said. 
</P>
<P>
	NeoTect can be wrong, Houn cautioned. It was about 70 percent  
accurate in detecting cancer, and 79 percent to 86 percent accurate 
in pinpointing patients who truly were cancer-free, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, NeoTect is not a stand-alone cancer test, the FDA  
stressed. 
</P>
<P>
	Although studies showed NeoTect was safe, patients will get  
standard warnings to be careful about sanitation after receiving a 
radioactive medicine. Most of NeoTect's radioactive ingredient is 
flushed out of the body in urine within four hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Diatide said NeoTect would cost approximately $500, about $1,500  
cheaper than the PET scan. The company said shipments to doctors 
would begin soon.

<HEADLINE> Verdict Thrown Out in 1971 Riot Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An appeals court has overturned more than $4  
million in jury awards to two former Attica inmates who claimed 
they were tortured by guards after the deadliest prison riot in 
U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Tuesday a lower court  
judge in Buffalo improperly instructed two juries before they 
returned verdicts in favor of former inmates Frank Smith and David 
Brosig in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel angry. I'm bitter. I'm disappointed, but I'm  
re-energized because I'm a fighter. I'm not a quitter,'' Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith had been awarded $4 million by a jury while another  
awarded Brosig $75,000. The jury trials for damages were held after 
a previous jury found that Karl Pfeil, a former assistant deputy 
superintendent at Attica, was liable for the mistreatment of the 
inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Pfeil's lawyers, Randy Rucinski, said the appeals court  
was correct. ``We're very happy with the result. We consider it a 
victory,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who had been serving a term for armed robbery, was one of  
the inmates most brutally beaten after the Sept. 9, 1971, uprising 
in which more than 1,200 inmates at Attica seized parts of the 
prison for several days. The prison was taken back in a raid that 
killed 10 hostages and 29 prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony showed prison supervisors were aware that after the  
uprising, guards had misconceptions about how inmates had treated 
their hostages but that the supervisors did nothing to correct the 
guards' erroneous impressions. The hostages, it turned out, had 
died from friendly fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, now 66, said he was beaten, threatened with death, forced  
to walk across broken glass and burned with cigarette butts and 
shell casings. He said that experience left him with posttraumatic 
stress disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the appeals court found that the juries  
considering damages were improperly permitted to revisit many of 
the same issues already considered by the liability jury. The 
appeals court suggested that the case be reassigned to a judge 
``best able to expedite its resolution.''

<HEADLINE> Corn, Soybean Prices Rise Again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans advanced to their highest levels in months  
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid concern upcoming rains 
will provide little relief to water-starved crops. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, orange juice futures also jumped, as did  
energy futures. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures advanced strongly a third day as  
private forecasters joined the National Weather Service in calling 
for widespread Midwestern rains over the next 10 days. But those 
meteorologists said actual rainfall totals will be light in the 
states that need the moisture most, including Illinois, Iowa, 
Indiana and Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	Hot, dry weather has taken its toll particularly in Illinois,  
one of the largest growing states, and Indiana. The government 
reported earlier this week that crop conditions had deteriorated 
sharply as young corn and soybean plants baked under temperatures 
that topped 100 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	While corn and soybean harvests likely will remain quite large,  
the reductions could come at a fortuitous time. Demand to Asia, a 
key exporting region for U.S. producers, is on the rise as 
countries there shake off economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 5 cents to $3.06 1/4 a bushel;  
December corn rose 5 3/4 cents to $2.36 1/2 a bushel; December oats rose 
1 1/4 cents to $1.18 1/4 a bushel; November soybeans rose 15 3/4 cents to 
$4.94 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Orange juice futures rose sharply on the Board of Trade of the  
City of New York, the parent of the New York Cotton Exchange, amid 
concern that hot weather in Florida could reduce the crop there. 
</P>
<P>
	Extreme heat could take its toll on the crop for a second year.  
Last year's crop production fell by 24 percent from a record 244 
million boxes the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants were bracing for the worst ahead of  
influential crop forecaster Elizabeth Steger's first production 
estimate, which is due next Thursday. That report comes two months 
before the USDA releases its first estimate for new production. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices also may have received a boost from word that a male  
Oriental fruit fly had been found north of Orlando, Fla. The pest 
damages crops, but sightings have been sporadic since it was first 
discovered in the region in May.

	September frozen concentrated orange juice rose 1.65 cents to  
81.65 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy futures advanced in a volatile trading session on the New  
York Mercantile Exchange as investors digested a report that Russia 
plans no gasoline exports during the month of August. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Fuel and Energy Ministry said all gasoline produced by  
Russian companies would be supplied only to the domestic market in 
a move aimed at preventing illegal exports. Exports of fuel oil and 
diesel also were to be cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The move could further tighten world inventories and comes just  
as the U.S. Energy Department reported gasoline and crude 
inventories last week fell more sharply than expected. An American 
Petroleum Institute report a day earlier had indicated gasoline 
supplies rose. 
</P>
<P>
	September crude rose 14 cents to $20.44 a barrel; September  
unleaded gasoline rose .92 cent to 63.94 cents a gallon; September 
heating oil rose .73 cent to 53.02 cents a gallon; September 
natural gas rose 4.4 cents to $2.642 for each 1,000 cubic feet.

<HEADLINE> FBI Holds Turkish Man in Custody </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A Turkish man removed from a Delta Air Lines  
flight before it left for Istanbul was held Wednesday for an 
expired visa as the FBI investigated what it would refer to only as 
the man's suspicious behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakan Caglar, 35, attracted the suspicion of law enforcement  
officials when he retrieved his luggage from a U-Haul truck on 
Tuesday and paid cash for a one-way ticket to Turkey at a Valdosta 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Caglar, who had been in the United States since March 7, is  
being held by the Immigration and Naturalization Service because 
his visa expired June 6, said Thomas Fisher, district director for 
the INS. 
</P>
<P>
	``He overstayed and that's the primary reason that we are  
holding him right now,'' Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI has not accused Caglar of committing a crime or planning  
to commit one. Agency spokeswoman Celestine Armstead said the fact 
Caglar paid for his ticket with cash was not all that called him to 
the agency's attention, but she would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's clear is that there are numerous issues that made us  
very, very suspicious,'' Ms. Armstead said. ``We are trying to 
resolve each and every issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All 217 passengers on Flight 40 to Istanbul, Turkey, were asked  
to get off the plane at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport on 
Tuesday night for a security sweep that included luggage. Five 
passengers sitting near the man were questioned and released. The 
flight departed more than four hours late. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon the plane's arrival in Istanbul, Turkish authorities  
questioned the same five passengers, along with a child, the 
semiofficial Anatolia news agency reported. The six Turkish 
citizens, who included one woman, were all released. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher said INS officials are interviewing Caglar about his  
activities in the United States. He said Caglar drove from Florida 
to Valdosta, where he caught a plane to Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Korean IOC Member Mum on Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A powerful South Korean Olympic  
official refused to comment today on a criminal case implicating 
his son in Salt Lake City's bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	A businessman pleaded guilty to tax fraud Tuesday, saying he  
helped the son of Kim Un-yong, an executive member of the 
International Olympic Committee, obtain lawful permanent resident 
status by setting up a sham job at his now-defunct communications 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Kim Un-yong cannot comment until he reviews all the  
details on the case,'' his chief secretary, Baek Sung-il, said. 
``But he is not too concerned about the latest development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The secretary distributed copies of a statement Kim's American  
lawyer, Howard Graff, issued right after the guilty plea in the 
first criminal case stemming from the U.S. federal investigation 
into Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is indeed unfortunate that by implication, Dr. Kim has once  
again been dragged into a story concerning the alleged misdeeds of 
others,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	David E. Simmons, the businessman, has admitted that he used  
fake contracts and phony invoices to conceal the fact that John 
Kim's salary was being paid by the Salt Lake City Olympic bid 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal, he said, was to win support for the city's quest for  
the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, a member of the IOC's ruling executive board and president  
of an international confederation of Olympic sports, has denied any 
wrongdoing in the Salt Lake City scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	He has said that his son worked with Simmons on purely business  
terms and that he was unaware of any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten IOC members either resigned or were expelled for receiving  
cash and other improper inducements from the Salt Lake City 
committee trying to win the right to hold the Olympics in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	An IOC probe ruled Kim's case as minor and closed the case with  
a ``severe warning'' to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Graff's statement said the arrangements for reimbursing Simmons  
by the bidders were kept secret from the family. Court documents 
released Tuesday offered no evidence that the elder Kim knew about 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	An IOC spokesman refused to comment, saying it would be  
``inappropriate'' because ``the proceedings are ongoing in the 
United States.''

<HEADLINE> Fed Court Asked To Enforce Prop 187 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Sponsors of a voter-approved ban on  
education and public services for illegal immigrants have asked a 
federal appeals court to allow enforcement of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes less than a week after Gov. Gray Davis said he  
had settled a lawsuit by dropping the state's appeal of a court 
ruling that declared most of Proposition 187 unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the governor abandoned the defense of Proposition 187,  
the will of the people was frustrated,'' the Pacific Legal 
Foundation, a pro-187 group, said Wednesday in papers filed with 
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposition 187, approved five years ago by 59 percent of the  
voters, would deny public education, social services and 
non-emergency health care to illegal immigrants, who were already 
ineligible for most health and welfare benefits under federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	In a final legal attempt to revive the ballot measure, the  
foundation argued that there is no longer any legal ``controversy'' 
between the state and opponents of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Constitution allows federal courts to hear only  
cases involving controversies between opposing parties, the judge's 
ruling should be withdrawn and the suit dismissed, the foundation 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The request, if granted, would require opponents to file a new  
suit and give supporters of the initiative a chance to defend it in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-187 groups stayed out of the previous case, deferring to  
then-Gov. Pete Wilson and then-Attorney General Dan Lungren, and 
were turned down when they sought later to intervene.

<HEADLINE> Oklahomans Reclaim Murrah Plaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- The outdoor plaza next to the Oklahoma City  
federal building -- used as a makeshift treatment center for victims 
in the deadly 1995 bombing -- was to reopen Thursday as a spot where 
workers once again can enjoy brown bag lunches. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounds of water cascading over a granite fountain can be heard  
by those who stop for a rest or observe progress in the 
construction of the Oklahoma National Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it'll be great when I can bring my lunch tomorrow and  
get used to enjoying it,'' bombing survivor Paul Heath, a 
psychologist at the Veteran's Administration, said of the Alfred P. 
Murrah Federal Building Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
	The Memorial construction can be viewed through a low glass wall  
on the north side of an observation platform on the plaza, which is 
adjacent to where the Murrah building once stood. Trees and plants 
have been planted, selected to closely match the original 
landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the most peaceful thing I've ever seen in an urban  
area,'' George Hozendorf, special assistant to the regional 
administrator of the General Services Administation, said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I loved it. I appreciated that they tried to put back the  
original,'' said Jim Denny, father of survivors Brandon and Rebecca 
who were in the day-care center at the time of the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Denny said so many times he would pick up the children from the  
center and spend time in the area. The playground area of the 
day-care center has been preserved behind a fence in the corner of 
the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
	Fences around the remainder of the plaza were scheduled to come  
down Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The fence has been a focal point for visitors at the bombing  
site. Many have left mementos in memory of the 168 people who died. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the plaza is not a memorial, the planners were mindful  
of the meaning it would have to Oklahomans, and the proximity to 
the memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not being able to bring someone back doesn't rob you from  
having the opportunity of experiencing the positive memory of those 
people when you walk around on the plaza,'' Heath said.

<HEADLINE> Shannon Sharpe Injured in Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Shannon Sharpe's disaster Down Under  
just got a whole lot worse. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Broncos tight end suffered an ankle strain Thursday  
and is in doubt for the exhibition game against San Diego on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe has been the most vocal critic of the NFL's decision to  
take the American Bowl to Australia for the first time because of 
the distance the teams were required to travel. 
</P>
<P>
	While Broncos coach Mike Shanahan believes the injury is little  
more than a minor strain, Sharpe was fuming after being forced to 
miss half of the practice session. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never wanted to come here,'' Sharpe said. ``Now I've got to  
fly back 17 hours with this and even if I get to play I know I'm 
going to be sore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe said he hopes to play Sunday against San Diego in the  
Olympic stadium, but said even that wouldn't cheer him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm having a bad week, not just a bad day,'' Sharpe said. ``I  
hate the place, the people are rude and I couldn't get a taxi for 
20 minutes. None of them would stop for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shannahan said he did not think Sharpe needed to be sent for an  
MRI on the ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's very serious, at least the doctors say they  
don't think it is very serious,'' Shanahan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone rolled on the back of his leg and initially we weren't  
sure if it was the knee or the ankle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan said the Broncos would take no risks with Sharpe's  
injury but that they will play him if he recovers in time. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe, 31, is preparing for his 10th season with the Broncos,  
has produced three 1,000-yard receiving seasons, matching an NFL 
record. He played in his seventh straight Pro Bowl last year after 
leading the NFL in receiving yards as a tight end. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe lashed out at NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue after the  
team touched down in Australia on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one should be made to have to fly 17 hours and play a  
football game,'' Sharpe said. ``I'm sorry, Mr. Tagliabue. You need 
to address this in our upcoming meetings. This is utterly 
ridiculous.''

<HEADLINE> '20/20' Helps ABC in Ratings / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Here's a quick review of ABC's four top rated  
prime-time programs last week: ``20/20,'' ``20/20,'' ``20/20'' and 
``20/20.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newsmagazine's Friday, Sunday, Monday and Wednesday editions  
each drew higher Nielsen Media Research ratings than anything put 
on the air by ABC's entertainment division last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's ``20/20'' drew the biggest audience, and was topped in  
Nielsen's prime-time standings for the week only by a ``Frasier'' 
rerun on NBC. Friday's ``20/20'' featured a Barbara Walters 
interview with tennis star Alexandra Stevenson and her mother, 
Samantha. 
</P>
<P>
	The best the entertainment division could do was a movie rerun,  
``A Kidnapping in the Family,'' which ranked No. 23 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The positive signs for ABC News didn't extend to its summer  
replacement series, ``Nightline in Primetime: Brave New World.'' 
The offbeat news show that examines concepts like speed and 
technology finished No. 76 in the ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other ABC specials, an entertainment show from Ford's  
Theatre and a review of the Paris fashion collections, fared even 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS won the week with a 6.5 rating and 12 share. NBC had a 6.2  
rating and 12 share, ABC was at 5.5 and 10, and Fox had a 4.6 
rating and 9 share. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the emerging networks, the WB had a 2.3 rating and 4  
share. Struggling UPN was at 1.4 and 3, while Pax TV was at 0.8 and 
2. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``World News Tonight'' won the evening news ratings race  
with a 7.4 and 16. The ``NBC Nightly News'' had a 7.2 rating and 16 
share, and the ``CBS Evening News'' was at 6.1 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of July 26-Aug. 1, the top 10 shows, their networks  
and ratings were: ``Frasier'' special, NBC, 8.6; ``20/20-Friday,'' 
ABC, 8.5; ``CBS Sunday Movie: Undue Influence, Part 1,'' CBS, 8.5; 
``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS, 8.5; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 8.4; 
``Frasier,'' NBC, 8.2; ``Dateline NBC-Tuesday,'' NBC, 8.1; ``ER,'' 
NBC, 8.1; ``Dateline NBC-Wednesday,'' NBC, 8.0; ``Friends,'' NBC, 
8.0.

<HEADLINE> Halle Berry Plays Dorothy Dandridge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It was a Saturday in Cleveland, and Halle  
Berry tuned in the local UHF channel for the afternoon movie. 
</P>
<P>
	The black-and-white screen sparkled with Dorothy Dandridge  
singing and dancing in the 1954 film ``Carmen Jones,'' featuring an 
all-black cast. Berry, then 18 and living in an all-white suburb, 
was transfixed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wow, everybody else in this movie is black, too, and they're  
talented and beautiful,'' she recalls thinking at the time. ``This 
seems like a happy place. I want to go wherever they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And so she did.  
</P>
<P>
	She stars in ``Introducing Dorothy Dandridge,'' a drama about  
the tragic actress-dancer-singer who was the first black woman 
nominated for an Academy Award as best actress. The movie debuts 
Aug. 21 on HBO. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry, who also served as an executive producer, spent six years  
trying to persuade Hollywood studios to take on the project. When 
she couldn't get a deal, she turned to cable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in love with Dorothy since the moment I saw her,''  
says Berry. ``I remember seeing how beautiful she was, of course, 
and then how charismatic and how fiery and what a talented actress 
she was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intrigued by this woman from her own hometown of Cleveland,  
Berry visited her local library to glean more about the actress. 
Sadly, she found only a one-sentence reference to the Oscar 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``That fueled my passion,'' Berry says. ``I didn't have many  
images of what black life was like growing up, so it was 
fascinating to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bringing Dandridge's life to the screen also appealed to singers  
Whitney Houston and Janet Jackson, who reportedly were interested 
in doing their own versions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Among the African-American community, well, this is a major  
story,'' says Martha Coolidge (``Lost in Yonkers,'' ``Rambling 
Rose,'' ``Out to Sea''), who directed the HBO movie. ``Why isn't 
the white community so aware of how great a story this is? Why do 
we have to introduce Dorothy anyway? We should all know her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During production, Dandridge's manager, Earl Mills, and best  
friend Geri Branton, dropped by with their memories of the woman 
they called ``Dottie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so comforting to have them there and be able to ask  
them, `Am I doing good?''' Berry says. ``Their stamp of approval 
was all I cared about because they knew her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dandridge, whose mother was an actress, entered show business at  
age 4, singing and dancing with her sister Vivian (Cynda Williams). 
She was a regular on the radio show ``Beulah,'' danced at the 
Cotton Club and made her screen debut in 1937 in the Marx Brothers 
classic, ``A Day at the Races.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The HBO movie details her marriage to the phenomenal tap dancer  
Harold Nicholas, played by Obba Babatunde, and the birth of their 
retarded daughter, as well as bigotry and her starring role in 
``Carmen Jones,'' where she captured the heart of Otto Preminger, 
the film's married, white director (Klaus Maria Brandauer). 
</P>
<P>
	``He became like putty in her hands because she was strong and  
he was attracted to her strength,'' Berry says. 
</P>
<P>
	During their affair, Preminger promised Dandridge they would be  
together publicly when the world was ready for an interracial 
couple. He later walked out on her. 
</P>
<P>
	``We grow up thinking we're going to find Prince Charming,''  
says Berry, who was divorced in 1997 from Cleveland Indians player 
David Justice. ``I know what that feels like -- to grow up wanting 
that and not being able to catch it, but always trying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dandridge's career careened off-course, and a second marriage,  
to nightclub owner Jack Dennison (D.B. Sweeney), ended after he 
physically abused her. (As a teen-ager, Dandridge was sexually 
assaulted by her mother's female friend, who was checking to see if 
the girl had lost her virginity during a date.) 
</P>
<P>
	``She was so torn down from the abuse she suffered ... that I  
don't think she thought she had anything else to offer but her 
beauty,'' Berry says. ``That was the real tragedy of her life. She 
was so smart and she was so strong, but she didn't know it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Dandridge retained her feistiness. She called Preminger  
``a big, fat bulldog'' when he bullied her into doing ``Carmen 
Jones,'' based on the Bizet opera. She told off studio head Daryl 
Zanuck, who told her she would be a huge star. And during an 
engagement at the Riviera hotel in Las Vegas, Dandridge was told 
``colored'' people were not allowed to use the pool. Defiantly, she 
dipped her toe in the pool, which later was drained and scrubbed. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of her Oscar nomination, she made the cover of Life  
magazine. But she lost the award to Grace Kelly, and, because 
Hollywood did not offer leading lady roles to black actresses, she 
was unable to parlay her nomination into other credible parts. 
Depressed, Dandridge began drinking and popping pills. 
</P>
<P>
	Even for black actresses today, lead roles are few. The next  
project for Berry, who co-starred with Warren Beatty in 
``Bulworth,'' is ``The X-Men,'' based on a cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Dandridge was a talented singer and dancer, two things Berry had  
never before studied. She learned to tap dance during three months 
of lessons. Singing was another matter: Wendy Williams provides 
vocals in the movie for such classics as George Gershwin's ``I've 
Got Rhythm'' and Cole Porter's ``You Do Something to Me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dandridge was bankrupt by the early 1960s. She was 42 and  
attempting to resurrect her career when she died from an overdose 
of a prescription antidepressant in 1965, the year before Berry was 
born. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was slowly killing herself for the last five years of her  
life and finally one day it caught her,'' Berry says. 
</P>
