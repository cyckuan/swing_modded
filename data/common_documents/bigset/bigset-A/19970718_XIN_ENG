<HEADLINE> Roundup:Kenya's Opposition Bids up for Talks with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The stage is set for further
confrontation in Kenya over constitutional reforms as the
opposition are demanding more when the government softens its
originally very hard tune on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders said today that they are not sure that the
government is really moving to meet their demands and thus will
stick to their crusade for change in the eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
The opposition National Convention Executive Council (NCEC)
vowed Thursday to push ahead with mass actions in July and August#,
including a nationwide strike on August 8 to paralyze business
and several rallies in major cities around the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opposition members of parliament gave Moi nine
pre-conditions for expected talks between Moi and the opposition
next week, urging Moi to publicly pledge to undertake the reforms
before the forthcoming general elections.
</P>
<P>
They also demanded all unviersities closed during the
campaign for constitutional reforms be re-opened, all people
arrested during the broken-up rallies be released and all rallies
on constitutional reforms be held with no need to seek permits.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties said now they want the government to
immediately start "legislative mechanics" for undertaking
comprehensive constitutional reforms, instead of minimum reforms
they had advocated before.
</P>
<P>
They have dismissed President Daniel arap Moi's announcement
issued Wednesday that licences for rallies will be granted
automatically on application.
</P>
<P>
Although Moi's announcement is widely regarded as a
remarkable concession to the reform demands, the opposition said
it was just a "favor," arguing the issue "now is not about favors
but serious constitutional reforms."
</P>
<P>
In another key step towards reforms, Kenya's ruling party
Kenyan African National Union (KANU) Thursday recommended that
the government put forward a bill in parliament for enactment of
a commission to review the constitution and make proposals.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Vice-President George Saitoti, holding the same post
in KANU, said KANU further suggested the government issue a
Statute Law bill in the current session of the parliament to
allow the repeal or amendment of laws charged as oppressive.
</P>
<P>
These laws include the Public Order Act on public rallies,
the Preservation of Public Security Act which allows detention
without trial, as well as other nine laws.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition parties responded the KANU's shift
with deep scepticism, saying they should wait to see if the KANU,
which has a majority in the parliament, can take actions
"genuinely".
</P>
<P>
From May to July, violence has been escalating when the
opposition repeatedly tried to hold rallies without government
permit in a bid to press for constitutional reforms before the
general elections. All the rallies were broken up by the police.
</P>
<P>
Under the current constitution, any candidate, if he wins no
less than 25 percent of votes respectively in five of the eight
provinces of Kenya, he can be qualified as a legal president.
</P>
<P>
The opposition urges to change the clause, demanding that the
future president should get more than 50 percent of the total
votes nationwide otherwise form a coalition government with other
parties.
</P>
<P>
The demand was turned down by the 73-year-old Moi, who has
ruled the country for 19 years.

<HEADLINE> Trade Integration Makes Big Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUCHENG (Shandong), July 18 (Xinhua) -- A conference on
reforming and developing export companies is being held in
Zhucheng, in east China's Shandong province, which is known for
its successful experiment of combining farmers, manufacturers, and
trading to improve the export market.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese farmers, manufacturers, and trading companies have
been forced to combine their business to survive in today's
competitive atmosphere as the government relaxes controls on
foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
The Zhucheng formula is one of forming a group with one or more
foreign trade companies, making regular ties with local farmers
and manufacturers by contracting out work.
</P>
<P>
Most foreign trade companies in China have no regular
suppliers. As the government gradually gives foreign trade rights
to more companies, competition for supplies and an overseas market
intensifies.
</P>
<P>
The Zhucheng Foreign Trade Group Company started with a rabbit
fur factory employing 18 workers, and ended up the biggest
supplier of chickens and natural pigment for the overseas market.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi said
at the conference today that the company is a trail-blazer in
developing successful county-level foreign trade enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Export-oriented enterprises at the county level are part of
China's huge foreign trade system and process most of China's farm
produce for export. However, they lack both the strength and the
outlets to compete in the overseas market.
</P>
<P>
By combining them with foreign trade companies and local farms,
it gives them the much-needed overseas market access, regular
orders, and better materials.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jinyou, general manager of the Zhucheng Foreign Trade
Group Company, said that this kind of combination is imperative
for the survival and success of local foreign trade enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin's Military Reform Plan Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Sweeping changes to reorganize
Russia's armed forces and slash troop numbers by nearly a third
were unveiled by the Kremlin today, two days after Russian
President Boris Yeltsin signed decrees about the reforms.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's decrees, issued on Wednesday, have not been published
in full but the Kremlin released some details on Friday, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Troops will be cut by 500,000 to 1.2 million by the end of next
year in a series of measures designed to turn the conscript-based
forces into a leaner professional fighting machine.
</P>
<P>
Strategic missile troops, military space forces and military
space air defense troops are to be regrouped into one force called
the strategic missile force. Air defense troops will merge with
the air force.
</P>
<P>
The first 200,000 personnel will be discharged by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Funds raised from privatizing some military organizations, and
the sale of property and equipment to be taken out of service, are
to be set aside to help discharged servicemen, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Defense spending for 1997 was set at 88.3 trillion roubles
(15.3 billion U.S. dollars) but was later reduced as part of
budget cuts. Officials say the military have so far got only 22
trillion roubles (3.82 billion U.S dollars).
</P>
<P>
Criticism of Yeltsin's reforms was prompt. Igor Rodionov, whom
Yeltsin sacked as defense minister in May for failing to carry out
reforms, today accused the president and the government of
destabilizing the army by launching "irresponsible" reforms.
</P>
<P>
Ousted security aide Alexander Lebed, a former army general,
said he was not optimistic about the reforms.

<HEADLINE> China, U.S. Paddlers to Commemorate "Ping Pong Diplomancy" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- World and Olympic champion Deng
Yaping and other present and former Chinese table tennis figures
will visit the United States later this month on a tour to mark
the history-making "Ping Pong Diplomacy" 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Table Tennis Association (CTTA) said on Friday that
joining Deng Yaping will be four members of the team which toured
the United States in 1972 -- Zhang Xielin, Zheng Minzhi, Lin
Huiqing and Qiu Yanliang.
</P>
<P>
This year's delegation, led by Xu Yinsheng, president of both
the CTTA and the International Table Tennis Federation, also
includes reigning world champions Yang Ying, Liu Guoliang, Ding
Song and coaches Cai Zhenhua and Lu Yuansheng.
</P>
<P>
In 1971, China invited the United States table tennis team to
visit China when the two countries had no diplomatic relations.
The Chinese national squad paid a return visit to the United
States in 1972.
</P>
<P>
The friendly sports exchanges played a positive role in
improving the relations of the two nations, which earned the name
of the "Ping Pong Diplomacy". China and the United States
established diplomatic relations in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The U.S delegation, which also will include U.S. table tennis
figures, will travel to China this August.
</P>
<P>
The CTTA will also stage an international table tennis
competition in Guangzhou from August 8-9, which will be
participated by top European, Asian, American and Chinese players.
</P>
<P>
The activities are organized by the CTTA, the National
Committee on U.S.-China Relations of the United States, and the
United States Table Tennis Association.

<HEADLINE> Russia Wants to Join EU: Chernomyrdin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia wants to join the European
Union (EU), but it has to sort things out at home first, visiting
Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin said here today.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin made the remark at a press conference in Brussels
after lengthy talks with Jacques Santer, president of the European
Commission, the EU's executive body.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that what they were doing at the EU
headquarters was "directed at one point" -- making preparations to
join the EU, just as Russian President Boris Yeltsin once said.
</P>
<P>
However, Chernonmyrdin said that the deep restructuring process
underway in Russia's economy limited the immediate scope for the
Russian authorities to meet requests for commitments, either from
the EU or the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
He held out hope that negotiations on Russia's accession to the
WTO could be completed by the end of 1998, thus underlining the
importance for Russia of early accession to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that both Russia and the Commission had
expressed satisfaction at the prospect of beginning substantive
talks soon in Geneva in regard to WTO accession.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the prospects of Russia becoming an EU member,
Santer said that economic reforms which had been undertaken by the
Russian authorities in a determined manner had given him
confidence in that regard.
</P>
<P>
He said that the EU would see greater interlinks established
with Russia in the near future, adding that the same would happen
to their bilateral political talks as their economic cooperation
went to an "even deeper level."
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the EU's anti-dumping policy, Chernomyrdin said
they discussed the matter in great details and reached a better
mutual understanding though there still existed points of
disagreement.
</P>
<P>
In regard to bilateral trade in textiles and clothing, both
sides noted that negotiations on a new agreement had been going on
for some time and that a certain progress had been made. They
agreed to aim at obtaining a mutually balanced agreement within
the shortest possible time.

<P>
MOSCOW, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The latest crisis on the Mir space
station will be over soon as Earth and the Russian-U.S. crew
restored a computer link on Thursday to allow experts to help the
cosmonauts repair the craft, the Interfax news agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Interfax quoted mission control chief Vladimir Solovyov as
saying that the station's batteries have been charged to a
sufficient extent to allow the station to rotate.
</P>
<P>
Solovyov told reporters on Thursday evening that Mir's
orientation towards the sun would be restored on Friday morning
and that the temperature and humidity inside the station are
normal.
</P>
<P>
Mission control has told the crew to sleep and then rest for
two days in a bid to recover their strength. Further repairs of
the Mir energy system, involving a space walk, have been postponed
while the crew rest.
</P>
<P>
The Mir lost all power on Thursday when the crew accidentally
disconnected a vital cable. But the three-man team remained safe
and quickly began repairing the damage.
</P>
<P>
With the orientation system down, Mir twisted chaotically for
several hours before it could be stabilized by firing thrusters on
the Soyuz capsule which is docked at the station.
</P>
<P>
The three-man crew had been forced to spend time in the Soyuz,
which would have brought them back to Earth in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
Mir has been in trouble since June 25, when a cargo craft
slammed into the station during a manual docking, piercing the
Spektr module and depriving Mir of up to half of its energy.

Canadian exports, extending the flat trend since February,
dipped 0.1 percent to 17.8 billion U.S. dollars in May.

In the meantime, its imports slipped 1.6 percent to 16.3

In May, Canadian imports from Japan and the European Union

<HEADLINE> Canada's Wholesale Trade Up Slightly in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Canada's wholesale trade increased
one percent in May to reach a total of 17.1 billion U.S. dollars,
Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
Canada's wholesale trade have increased in all but four months
since the beginning of 1996, the federal statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
In May, the largest monthly increases in percentage terms were
recorded by wholesalers of farm machinery, farm-related products
and paper products.
</P>
<P>
Canadian wholesalers of farm machinery reported sales increases
of more than 10 percent in April and May. Sales of farm machinery
have been generally rising since mid-1995.
</P>
<P>
"Some of that strength can be attributed to low interest rates
which make the purchase of new equipment more attractive," the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
In Canada, computer sales have slowed in the last few months
after a period of general increases that started around mid-1995.
</P>
<P>
"This may reflect some supply problems of key computer
components and a weaker demand," the agency noted.
</P>
<P>
After two months of strong declines, computer sales were up 0.5
percent in May from the previous month. However, sales were down
3.8 percent compared to May 1996.
</P>
<P>
The inventories of wholesalers remained unchanged in May at 24
billion dollars, following a period of general increases beginning
around mid-1996.

<HEADLINE> "Missing" Students Found Safe in Northern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A group of 22 university students
who were reported missing earlier on a mountain in the northern
Philippines were found safe today, the police said.
</P>
<P>
The local Sky Cable Television quoted a police report as saying
that the first batch of the students had already come down the
1,200-meter-high Mountain Natib in Bataan province.
</P>
<P>
The police said the remaining students will leave the mountain
soon after being delayed by heavy rains which caused the mountain
path to be slippery.
</P>
<P>
The report said the students' radio signal for food and other
supplies was misunderstood as a signal for rescue by a Manila
amateur radio enthusiast Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The radio enthusiast informed the police and then hundreds of
rescuers, backed by helicopters, were sent to the area to look for
the students, who went up the mountain last weekend.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton said his panel on race would focus on
"multiracism," a position already questioned by the panel's leader
who sees black-white relations as central.
</P>
<P>
-- Representative Bill Paxon resigned his post as one of
Speaker New Gingrich's top lieutenants Thursday, after junior
House members sought to enlist his help and that of other House
leaders in a coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton resumed his crusade to improve race
relations in America Thursday by vowing to battle the tide against
affirmative action and reverse recent actions threatening to
virtually wipe out minority enrollments in some California and
Texas graduate schools.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton Thursday selected Army General H. Hugh
Shelton to be chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>

billion dollar more than the current level, must be reconciled
with a House version expected to be passed next week.
</P>
<P>
-- Clinton will seek 350 million dollars to fund minority
teaching initiatives. Addressing the NAACP convention in
Pittsburgh, the president said his five-year race-relations
proposals aims to add 35,000 teachers in rural and inner-city
schools. He also urged resistance to calls for segregated
schooling.
</P>
<P>
USA Today:

warned Europe Thursday of possible U.S. sanctions if Europeans try

<HEADLINE> Indian Ministers Decide to Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 18 (Xinhua)-- Three Indian ministers loyal to
Laloo Prasad Yadav, president of the newly floated Rashtriya
Janata Dal, today announced their decision to continue as
ministers as long as their party is part of the ruling United
Front (UF) and pledged support to Prime Minister Inder Kumar
Gujral and UF's common minimum program.
</P>
<P>
"We have revised our decision to resign in view of statements
issued by the Front convener, N. Chandrababu Naidu, and President
of Dravida Mummetra Kazhagam (DMK) M. Karunanidhi, that the core
group of the Front had not taken any decision to keep our party
out of the UF," Food Minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh said here.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the reported decision of the UF's core group last
night that the Rashtriya Janata Dal should be kept away, Singh
said to reporters at his residence that it was part of a
deep-rooted conspiracy to break the UF. He, however, refused to
divulge who all were behind the conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
He asked the Front leadership to immediately convene a meeting
of the full Steering Committee to decide whether his party should
remain in the Front. The core group of the UF decided to have such
meeting on July 25.
</P>
<P>
The Janata Dal, the major constituent of the UF, was split into
two factions early this month. While Sharad Yadav is heading the
Janata Dal, his arch rival Laloo Prasad Yadav is leading newly
floated Rashriya Janata Dal. Sharad Yadav, supported by some UF
constituents, is strongly against the entry of Laloo's party into
the UF. Laloo Prasad has time and again said that his party would
continue to support the UF government.

NICOSIA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A top Russian envoy called here
today for compromise between Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides in a

<P>
The Russian official noted that the next steps to be taken on
the Cyprus problem will be discussed during the second round of
direct talks between the two sides scheduled to be held on August
11-16 at Montreux, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the methodology the U.N. has introduced during
the face-to-face talks between President Clerides and Denktash at
Troutbeck, near New York from July 9 to 12, Tchizhov said this
methodology is different from previous ones which he described as
"not very successful."
</P>
<P>
"In the past, the U.N. and successive Secretaries-General
presented documents, noted both sides' observations and then
reported to the Security Council that the chasm remained and
could not be bridged. Now however, negotiations have begun on
specific issues," the Russian official said.
</P>
<P>
Tchizhov noted that the issue of sovereignty is a major
stumbling block to a solution to the Cyprus problem and both
sides on the island held widely divergent views on the issue.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not exclude the possibility that some sort of
agreement can be reached on that sticking point.
</P>
<P>
The Russian envoy also reiterated his government position
that the whole process in Cyprus must continue to develop within
the U.N. framework.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus issue has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was partitioned after Turkish troops took over the
northern third in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with
Greece by some Greek Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Moves to Revitalize Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government will
conclude plans to boost economic growth by the end of this
month, economic observers said here today.
</P>
<P>
To achieve growth, the government is to introduce three
salutary initiatives which are expected to alleviate the present
harsh economic climate and reduce the operating cost of
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The measures are an across-the-board improvement in wages, the
gradual release of capital votes and the revaluation of Naira,
the local currency, in a view to cutting the cost of
manufacturers' inputs.
</P>
<P>
The steps are to be taken as the economy turned sluggish in
the first half of this year because of government's tight fiscal
and monetary measures.
</P>
<P>
According to a Finance Ministry source, the reflationary
package planned is to be implemented systematically so that
inflation rate does not shoot up more than what the government
can contain.
</P>
<P>
The government was emboldened by its success in the control of
cash and current account (M1), which grew by 1.7 percent in the
first quarter of this year instead of 15 percent projected.
</P>
<P>
The M1 headroom, according to the source, is in turn to be
used by the government for the planned economic reflation, which
is expected to cause no damage to the macro-economic achievements
characterized by declining inflation rate and stable exchange and
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Total capital votes for the first half year stand at 44
billion Naira (about 5.2 billion U.S. Dollars). The much-awaited
release will ensure that new contracts are executed and jobs are
created.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture and infrastructure and energy will be the main
focus of government's strategy in its release of capital votes.
</P>
<P>
With the revaluation of Naira, manufacturing companies, which
recorded higher operation costs in the second quarter due to the
devaluation of Naira in March, may be able to access to more
funds to lower the cost.
</P>
<P>
It is also expected to have a mitigating influence on the
inflationary nature of the capital vote release and improvement
in wages.
</P>
<P>
Observers say the increase in wage is expected to improve the
purchasing power of workers, stimulating demand for goods and
services,thus rekindling activities in the manufacturing
sector.
</P>
<P>
As an early reaction to the news of revaluation of the local
currency, export proceeds gained 1.5 Naira in local foreign
exchange markets on Thursday, at a rate of 82 Naira to the U.S.
Dollar.

PARIS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Chris Boardman of Britain had a
disaster in Friday's 55km time-trial 12th stage of the Tour de
France when the race reached in St Etienne.
</P>
<P>
The world hour record-holder, suffering from a bad back hurt in

</P>
<P>
"It's the first time in five years as a professional I've
finished a time-trial so badly," added Boardman who admitted he
had been taking pain-killers and anti-inflammatories since he fell

<HEADLINE> China's Trade Minister Says Companies Should Be More Active </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUCHENG (Shandong), July 18 (Xinhua) -- Minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi, speaking to a conference on
reforming and developing local foreign trade enterprises today,
encouraged them to choose a style of management that best suits
them so that they will contribute more to China's foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Wu urged the firms to increase the exports of farm and sideline
produce by integrating trade, industry and agriculture as an
important means of development.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the drop in farm and sideline produce, they still
have a certain position in foreign trade, and an increase would be
significant to China's agriculture and its foreign trade, she said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the overseas-funded companies, some 14,000
domestic enterprises have got licenses for doing foreign trade,
2,000 of which are county or prefectural-level companies.
</P>
<P>
Wu encouraged local trading companies to increase
competitiveness through mergers or acquiring, or by establishing
enterprise groups, and said they should change their style of
management and their property rights system by re-evaluating their
property, and establish a structure with the stated-owned share in
the lead.
</P>
<P>
Managers should be under the leadership of board of directors,
she noted, and the labor, personnel and distribution of benefits
should be fundamentally reformed.
</P>
<P>
The minister also expressed the hope that local trade
enterprises will pay closer attention to the domestic market, and
get actively involved in the domestic trade business as well.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Ruling Party Meets for 1998 Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine ruling Lakas-NUCD
party led by President Fidel Ramos is expected to hold a vital
meeting this evening on the selection of a party standard bearer
for the May 1998 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Ramos will meet for the first time with all
six presidential aspirants from his Lakas-NUCD (National Union of
Christian Democrats) party, according to a press release issued by
the party's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the meeting between Ramos and the party's
leading contenders for presidential nomination aims to "further
strengthen unity, teamwork and cohesion" within the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
There have been fears in the party that a fierce struggle for
the party's nomination and the endorsement of Ramos will possibly
split the administration camp like in the previous 1992 election.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Ramos broke away from the then ruling Laban party and
formed the Lakas party after failing to be nominated by Laban
national convention. But Ramos won the election with the
anointment of former president Corazon Aquino.
</P>
<P>
Those invited to attend the meeting are the party's six
presidential contenders -- Speaker of the House of Representatives
Jose de Venecia, Senator Leticia Shahani, Defense Secretary Renato
de Villa, Presidential Adviser on Economic Affairs Emilio Osmena,
Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo and Senator Heherson Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
Also invited are Local Government Secretary Robert Barbers and
Chairman Manuel Morato of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes, who
are aiming to be nominated as vice presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
The party's 16-man ad hoc committee on electoral policy
formulation will also attend the meeting. The committee is
expected to brief the presidential aspirants on the progress of
the nomination and selection process being undertaken by the
ruling party.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is expected to clarify vital issues pertaining to
the mechanics and composition of the party's national convention
and the timing of Ramos endorsement for the presidential bet.
</P>
<P>
It will also discuss the conduct of nationwide pre-convention
consultations with Lakas members to determine party preferences
for the presidential nomination.

SHENZHEN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Six people, five of whom were
Hong Kong residents, were executed here today for smuggling and
dealing in drugs.
</P>
<P>
According to the verdict handed down by the Shenzhen
Intermediate People's Court, since 1993 they had been involved in
four separate illegal drug deals, making a large profit from
selling drugs in the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
The court revealed that one of the serious cases involved the
trafficking of 37,154 grams of heroin.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with Chinese law, because their crimes involved
the selling and smuggling of drugs, and because the sums involved
were very large and the criminal offence extremely serious, they
were given the death sentence.

<P>
KUNMING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Communist Party (VCP)
General Secretary Do Muoi ended a five-day visit to China today in
the capital city of Yunnan province, which borders Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
In Yunnan, he visited local enterprises, teacher's residential
areas in Kunming, the picturesque Stone Forest, a national
minority village, and a farming village on Yangzonghai Lake, where
he saw how 268 households have got rich under China's reform and
opening up policy.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the Chinese province, Do Muoi visited
the local tourism and tobacco industries and got some idea of the
province's development in agriculture and township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese leader said that China's reform and opening-up
have scored many achievements. He noted that there have been big
changes in urban and rural areas and in infrastructure development.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief that under the leadership of CPC, there
will be even greater development in the future.
</P>
<P>
He said that Vietnam and Yunnan are complementary in certain
ways while voicing the hope that the two sides can enhance
economic and trade cooperation as well as such cooperation in
science and technology, and transport.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Agency Urges Structural Reform for Long-term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Structural reforms in financial
markets and deregulation are essential for the Japanese economy's
long-term growth, the Economic Planning Agency's (EPA) annual
white paper on the economy said today.
</P>
<P>
Japan's potential for long-term economic growth is at risk
unless the government and the private sector accelerate reforms of
its inefficient financial services markets, the white paper
warned.
</P>
<P>
Other non-manufacturing sectors, such as retailing and
construction, should also be liberalized to enhance their
productivity, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The white paper, submitted by the EPA and adopted by the
cabinet later in the day, said the economy was finally moving
towards recovery after a minor downturn in the summer of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The EPA admitted that the increase in the consumption tax in
April from 3 to 5 percent had slowed down economic activity, but
said this adverse effect "will not have the power to reverse the
trend" (of recovery) and that "after such impact runs its course,
the Japanese economy should regain momentum for a self-reliant
recovery."
</P>
<P>
The paper said, "The problem is how (that dynamism for
recovery) can be linked to sustainable, long-term prosperity."
</P>
<P>
Japan has to overcome many hurdles and the government needs to
implement deregulation and structural reforms in the financial and
non-manufacturing sectors.
</P>
<P>
The financial system is an area where "particularly drastic
reform should be promoted," the paper says.
</P>
<P>
Japan's financial intermediary system -- under a web of
regulations on interest rates, commissions or business sectors --
has failed to provide consumers and corporations with diversified
financial instruments, it says.
</P>
<P>
The report also says that deregulation to promote foreign
investment and to facilitate mergers and acquisitions in Japan
will help improve productivity in the service sector because
newcomers will bring competition through better technologies and
services.

<HEADLINE> Senior Official Speaks at Central Party School Graduation ceremony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Some 3,000 students graduated from
the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee's Party School,
today.
</P>
<P>
The school's president, Hu Jintao, who is a member of the
Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee's Political
Bureau, spoke at the graduation ceremony and handed them their
certificates.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, over 2330 people graduated from the school's
state government and army branches.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that officials have the historical responsibility of
improving themselves and developing the Party. He asked the
graduates to carefully study an important speech made by President
Jiang Zemin at the school in May of this year and urged them to
uphold the banner of Deng Xiaoping. Party officials must implement
the Party's basic policy thoroughly, correctly, and actively, he
said, and get involved in the reforms and opening up and the
modernization drive wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P>
To build China into a prosperous, strong, democratic and
civilized country, they need strict criteria for themselves and
need to temper themselves, adhering to the Party's basic doctrine
of serving the people wholeheartedly. They must strengthen and
safeguard the unity of the Party consciously and must resist
corruption and promote clean government.
</P>
<P>
Hu went on to say that Deng's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics is the guiding principle of the whole
Party, a spiritual pillar of the Chinese nation, and the
ideological weapon of every official. The relationship between them
and the people is one of fundamental stance, world outlook, and
Party spirit.
</P>
<P>
Correct political orientation must be maintained, and that
points in the direction of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics that represents the people's fundamental
interests. He urged them to place the people's interests foremost
while remaining consistent with the CPC Central Committee with
Jiang Zemin at its core.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Demand Leader's Release for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's military junta
Thursday asked for the release of ex-rebel leader Foday Sankoh as
the first condition for peace, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
It would be impossible to strike a deal without Sankoh, leader
of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) who has been under
security protection in the Nigerian capital of Abuja since March
this year, said a spokesman of the junta.
</P>
<P>
The RUF, which launched a civil war against successive
governments in Sierra Leone since 1991, entered the capital
Freetown in the wake of the May 25 coup which brought Major
Johnny Koroma to power.
</P>
<P>
It is reported Koroma has included some 6,000 RUF fighters in
his armed forces and named Sankoh the number two man of his
government.
</P>
<P>
"You can't make any peace in Sierra Leone without Foday
Sankoh," said the spokesman, Corporal Tamba Gborie, who
reportedly led the coup that toppled the civilian government led
by President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Gborie was in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, with a government
delegation for talks with west African countries on settling the
crisis caused by the coup in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The coup, which received wide international condemnation, has
led to military intervention of the sub-regional peacekeeping
force (ECOMOG) led by Nigeria, in a bid to restore Kabbha's
government.
</P>
<P>
Bloody clashes have been reported between ECOMOG and troops
loyal to Koroma, with more than 100 people dead. ECOMOG still
holds some strategic positions in Freetown.

Giving another condition for the military to relinquish power,
Gborie said "we are ready to disarm, but we can't (do it) with
Nigeria's bombing our country."
</P>
<P>
The result of the one-day talks is yet to be known but
observers here noted that the conditions of the junta might not
be accepted by the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) Committee of Four on Sierra Leone.

The Abidjan meeting between the junta and the Committee of
Four was seen as a last option for peaceful settlement of the
Sierra Leonean crisis before a military operation.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Philippines to Strengthen Investment Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran, one of the world's biggest
oil producers, has agreed to make major investments in Mindanao,
the southern Philippines, the Philippine Presidential Press Office
said today.
</P>
<P>
A Memorandum of Agreement on investment cooperation was signed
here this morning by Ali Shams Ardekani, secretary general of the
Iranian Chamber of Commerce, Mines and Industry, and Philippine
officials, the office said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Under the memorandum, Iran agreed to pour investments into
oil-related downstream industries, cement and steel plants in
joint venture with Filipino investors.
</P>
<P>
Iran will build a 150,000 barrel per day oil refinery, a cement
plant, a rolling steel mill and an assembly plant for farm
tractors in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos, who witnessed the signing of the
document, said the agreement manifested the very effective
partnership that exists between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Mindanao, where the economy has been battered by a long-time
Muslim separatist movement, has attracted large amounts of foreign
investments since last September when a major Muslim rebel group
forged a peace pact with the government.
</P>
<P>
Peace has returned to most parts of Mindanao after the signing
of the peace deal by the rebel Moro National Liberation Front
(MNLF) and Manila last year.

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa to Suffer Long Dry Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
Community (SADC) officials said global climatic change may end in
little rains in the region during the 1997/98 crop season.
</P>
<P>
In its latest bulletin released here today, the organization
said events were following a trend frequently associated with dry
years.
</P>
<P>
"Although it is still early to make any definite predictions
concerning the next rainly season... observations of global
climatic data and results of climate forecasting models point to
the possibility of another warm El Nino-Southern Oscillation
(ENSO) occurring during the 1997/98 crop growing season," it
said.
</P>
<P>
Warm episodes have been associated with poor rainfall in
southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Anomalously warm sea surface temperatures in the eastern
Pacific ocean and the central Indian Ocean through February were
often associated with poor rains in southern SADC, it said.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin said the current developments, which could have
potentially adverse impacts on the 1997/98 crop season, had been
reported as a matter of concern to SADC ministers of food,
agriculture and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
"The drought monitoring center, the regional early warning
system and national meteorological services will continue to
monitor developments closely and will collaborate in providing
further reports in the near future," said the bulletin.

<HEADLINE> Three Union Ministers in India Asked to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 18 (Xinhua)-- President of newly formed
Rashtriya Janata Dal and Bihar Chief Minister Laloo Prasad Yadav
today asked his party's three union ministers to resign from the
United Front (UF) government headed by Inder Kumar Gujral.
</P>
<P>
Following the decision not to induct his party into the UF,
Laloo had asked his party's ministers to resign, he told reporters
at his official residence in Bihar state in eastern India.
</P>
<P>
A UF core committee meeting was held here Thursday night and
different views were expressed over the entry of Laloo's party
into the UF.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the UF said that the four-hour meeting had
decided to keep the Rashtriya Janata Dal, a split faction from the
Janata Dal on July 5 this year, out of the UF.
</P>
<P>
President of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), a constituent of
the UF, today however said that Thursday evening's meeting did not
decide to keep Laloo's party out of the UF and that the UF
Steering Committee would decide the issue in its July 25 meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Janata Dal, the major constituent of the 13-party UF, was
split into two factions in early July. Laloo Prasad's main rival
Sharad Yadav became new president of the Janata Dal in the July 3
party election while Laloo Prasad and his supporters boycotted the
party election and floated a new party called Rashtriya Janata Dal
on July 5.
</P>
<P>
Before the party's election, Laloo Prasad was its president.
Laloo has time and again said that his new party would continue to
support the UF government in the center.
</P>
<P>
Because of the split, the union ministers belonging to the
Janata Dal were also split into two groups. Coal Minister Kanti
Singh, Non-Conventional Energy Affairs Minister Jai Narayan Nishad
and, Food and Consumer Affairs Minister Raghubans Prasad Singh
support Laloo Prasad.
</P>
<P>
Laloo Prasad told reporters that his party would continue to
support the UF government at the center from outside. Holding
Former Prime Minister Deve Gowda responsible for denying his
party's entry into the front, he charged Gowda with playing into
the hands of communal forces to weaken the secular front.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Conference on "One Country, Two Systems" in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A two-day international
conference on "one country, two systems", the basic principle of
the Chinese government for Hong Kong after its return to China on
July 1 this year, ended here today.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 law experts from Hong Kong, China's interior areas and
other parts of the world, including lawyers, legislators, judges,
professors and researchers, attended the "One Country, Two
Systems: Theory and Practice" conference at Hotel Furama in
downtown Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
They exchanged views on a wide range of topics, such as the
political, economic and judicial structures of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) after 1997, application of
the HKSAR Basic Law and other Chinese national laws in Hong Kong,
and roles of the HKSAR Chief Executive and Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed human rights and environment protection in
Hong Kong, prospects for cooperation between Hong Kong and China's
interior areas and many other issues.
</P>
<P>
In a special speech this morning, Rita Fan Hsu Lai Tai,
chairwoman of the HKSAR Provisional Legislative Council (PLC),
reviewed the PLC's establishment and its major responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Since it was elected on December 21 last year, she said, the
60-member PLC has to date passed four bills and adopted 19
motions.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa, Chief Executive of the HKSAR, Thursday attended
the opening ceremony of the conference, which was jointly
sponsored by the Center for Chinese and Comparative Law of the
City University of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong-based One Country,
Two Systems Economic Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
Initiated by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in the
1980s, the concept of "one country, two systems" allows two
different social systems -- socialism and capitalism -- to coexist
and seek common development within one sovereign state.

<HEADLINE> Roundup:Kenya's Opposition Bids up for Talks with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The stage is set for further
confrontation in Kenya over constitutional reforms as the
opposition are demanding more when the government softens its
originally very hard tune on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders said today that they are not sure that the
government is really moving to meet their demands and thus will
stick to their crusade for change in the eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
The opposition National Convention Executive Council (NCEC)
vowed Thursday to push ahead with mass actions in July and August#,
including a nationwide strike on August 8 to paralyze business
and several rallies in major cities around the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opposition members of parliament gave Moi nine
pre-conditions for expected talks between Moi and the opposition
next week, urging Moi to publicly pledge to undertake the reforms
before the forthcoming general elections.
</P>
<P>
They also demanded all unviersities closed during the
campaign for constitutional reforms be re-opened, all people
arrested during the broken-up rallies be released and all rallies
on constitutional reforms be held with no need to seek permits.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties said now they want the government to
immediately start "legislative mechanics" for undertaking
comprehensive constitutional reforms, instead of minimum reforms
they had advocated before.
</P>
<P>
They have dismissed President Daniel arap Moi's announcement
issued Wednesday that licences for rallies will be granted
automatically on application.
</P>
<P>
Although Moi's announcement is widely regarded as a
remarkable concession to the reform demands, the opposition said
it was just a "favor," arguing the issue "now is not about favors
but serious constitutional reforms."
</P>
<P>
In another key step towards reforms, Kenya's ruling party
Kenyan African National Union (KANU) Thursday recommended that
the government put forward a bill in parliament for enactment of
a commission to review the constitution and make proposals.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Vice-President George Saitoti, holding the same post
in KANU, said KANU further suggested the government issue a
Statute Law bill in the current session of the parliament to
allow the repeal or amendment of laws charged as oppressive.
</P>
<P>
These laws include the Public Order Act on public rallies,
the Preservation of Public Security Act which allows detention
without trial, as well as other nine laws.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition parties responded the KANU's shift
with deep scepticism, saying they should wait to see if the KANU,
which has a majority in the parliament, can take actions
"genuinely".
</P>
<P>
From May to June, violence has been escalating when the
opposition repeatedly tried to hold rallies without government
permit in a bid to press for constitutional reforms before the
general elections. All the rallies were broken up by the police.
</P>
<P>
Under the current constitution, any candidate, if he wins no
less than 25 percent of votes respectively in five of the eight
provinces of Kenya, he can be qualified as a legal president.
</P>
<P>
The opposition urges to change the clause, demanding that the
future president should get more than 50 percent of the total
votes nationwide otherwise form a coalition government with other
parties.
</P>
<P>
The demand was turned down by the 73-year-old Moi, who has
ruled the country for 19 years.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Sends Warships to N. Cyprus for Celebrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Six Turkish warships arrived at
northern Cyprus this morning for celebrations marking the 23th
anniversary of Turkish intervention in the northern part of the
Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said two frigates, two speedboats and two
submarines sailed into the port of Girne in an open parade of
Turkey's determination to safeguard the security of Turkish
Cypriots on the divided island,
</P>
<P>
Cyprus was split in 1974 into two communities, with Greek
Cypriots owning two thirds of the island in the south and Turkish
Cypriots, the northern third, in the wake of an abortive
coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's newly-appointed Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit,
who in 1974 was the prime minister that ordered Turkish troops to
land on the island, is expected at Sunday's celebrations in
northern Cyprus heading a large delegation.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with a senior Turkish Cypriot official here
Wednesday, the hardline Turkish leader warned that Turkey's
exclusion from the coming European Union (EU) membership
negotiations would hamper the ongoing direct talks between Greek
and Turkish Cypriot sides sponsored by U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan.
</P>
<P>
Ankara was obviously angered by a European Commission agreement
Tuesday to recommend six nations - Cyprus, Poland, the Czech
Republic, Hungary, Slovenia, and Estonia - for the first wave of
EU accession talks.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit threatened that the "discriminative decision" by the
EU's executive body would speed up the integration process of
Turkey and northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus issue has long been a thorny problem for the
international community. At present, around 30,000 Turkish troops
remain stationed on the northern third of the island.

<HEADLINE> Ban on Medicine Imports Causes More Deaths in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The current ban on the
importation of chloroquine, anti-malaria medicine by the private
sector in Uganda has caused increase of malaria deaths, the local
daily, The New Vision, reported today.
</P>
<P>
Edward Ddumba of the medical department in Mulago Hospital
here was quoted as saying that this week there was no injectable
chloroquine drug in all private clinics in Kampala, following the
ban on its importation by Uganda National Drug Authority (UNDA)
starting in May this year.
</P>
<P>
Noah Lukoda, medical officer of central district of Luwero was
quoted as saying that one of the reasons for the escalation of
malaria in his district is the acute shortage of both injectable
chloroquine and quinine drugs in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Lukoda said, on the average, private clinics and hospitals
handle 60 percent of the patients in the country. In some places
the percentage is as high as 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Malaria is the number one killer disease in the country,
contributing 25 percent of deaths.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that chloroquine cannot cure severe malaria
because this kind of malaria is resistant to quinine.
</P>
<P>
Because of low quality of chloroquine imported by the private
sector, UNDA banned its importation.
</P>
<P>
However, chloroquine is still the first line of treatment of
malaria all over the country and doctors can't do without it.
They still put it on the essential drugs list.
</P>
<P>
Due to lack of anti-malaria drugs such as quinine and other
reasons such as movements of displaced persons, an epidemic of
malaria has broken out around Lake Wamala, 60 km west of Kampala.
</P>
<P>
About 150 people in Kapchorwa, eastern Uganda, have been
killed by malaria since May when the UNDA started to ban
importation of quinine by the private sector.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea to Renovate Financial Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance and Economy said today that the collapse of
the eight-largest conglomerate Kia Group, following Hanbo, Sammi and
Jinro, stemmed from the excessive expansion of its business territory.
</P>
<P>
A series of group insolvencies were mainly due to the transfer of
huge sums of money gained by the group's leading companies to their
affiliates through insider-trading, which eventually leading to the
deterioration of the group's overall capital holdings, the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
Although the government has limited the money transfer among
affiliates to a certain level through steps to control and prevent
mutual capital investment, most conglomerates are crossing the limits
by stepping laws aside, the ministry added.
</P>
<P>
"Large-scale bankruptcies will considerably be curtailed should
conglomerates improve their financial structure by slimming their debt
ratios and raising their asset proportion," a ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
Despite strong backlashes from business circles, the government has
decided to take a tough stance to ensure the process goes forward with
ways to renovate their financial structure, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the government plans to scale down the functions of
chairman and planning-coordination offices since they were found to be
meddling in the management of subsidiaries and pave the way in
curtailing tax payments through tax consultations at a group level, he
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Two hundred kilometers from the Earth, the mission of two
Russian astronauts and their American colleague on board the space
station Mir turned into a catastrophic scenario on Thursday, as an
essential cable disconnected by mistake cut electric supply and put
computers out of service. The team was plunged into darkness for
the 45 minutes when the space station could not be lighted by the
Sun, and reparation work was not expected to be completed within two
days.
</P>
<P>
-- Voters in the Russian city Niji-Novgorod, formerly called
Gorky and now the lighthouse of economic reform in Russia, elected
with a narrow majority of votes on Monday Ivan Skliarov, a reformer,
as its governor to replace Boris Nemtsov, now the number three of
the Kremlin. The election, which drew nationwide attention as a test
of public opinion, also saw a Communist Party candidate, allied with
the far-right Liberal Democratic Party, closely trailing the liberal
candidate in the two rounds of election.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin is expected to
announce next Monday a plan to raise 21 billion francs (3.5 billion
U.S. dollars) of taxes on enterprises in order to reduce the public
deficit to about 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). An audit
of public finance is expected to confirm early next week that the
public deficit of France this year would stand at 3.6-3.7 percent of
the GDP, if no measure is taken to cut the deficit.
</P>
<P>
-- The possible ratification by the French Parliament of an
international convention on the protection of primary arts and
objects of art could worry arts collectors. In order to stop the
stealing of an average of 50,000 art objects each year from Africa,
the Middle East and Asia, the convention allows the original owners
to reclaim their properties in a period ranging from three to 50
years.

<HEADLINE> Cotton Doing Well in North and Central China Provinces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Some 1.2 million ha of cotton, or
more than a quarter of China's total growing area this year, are
doing well in northern Hebei Province and central Henan Province,
statistics from the two provinces show.
</P>
<P>
Hybrid-seed areas accounted for 95 percent of the land planted,
while plastic sheeting was applied to nearly half this year's
cotton acreage, which are both guarantees of a good harvest under
normal conditions.
</P>
<P>
Hebei sent 4,000 technical personnel to the cotton fields to
help farmers improve management and fight the bollworm
disease. And the province sold agricultural equipment to cotton
growers on credit.
</P>
<P>
An anti-drought campaign is going strong in these two provinces.
</P>
<P>
China planted 4.5 million ha of cotton fields this year.

<HEADLINE> Shanxi to Hold Cultural and Tourism Festival on Merchants' Courtyards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, July 18 (Xinhua) --The first cultural and tourist
festival based on the theme of merchants' courtyards of ancient
dynasties, will be held in Qixian County of Shanxi Province from
July 20 to 26.
</P>
<P>
Qixian, together with Taigu, Pingyao, Jiexiu and Lingshi, which
are all situated in the central part of Shanxi Province, are
considered as the birthplace of Shanxi's commercial culture.
</P>
<P>
According to historical records, many of the businessmen who
had dominated the domestic and overseas business community from
the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) to Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) made
their start here.
</P>
<P>
These businessmen built many grandiose courtyards of
distinctive styles in the heyday of their careers in central
Shanxi, and the places have now become a popular tourist
destination for visitors to Shanxi province, also a leading coal
producer in China.
</P>
<P>
During the festival, the organizing committee will arrange four
special tourist routes to ancient sites of courtyards built by
merchants and to museums featuring folk customs and folklore. Also
on the agenda are auctions of cultural goods and various cultural
performances.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market ended

percent surge in Coca Cola Amatil shares and stronger gold and
resource sectors.

Australian dollars with 2.845 million shares traded in another day
of volatility for the popular soft drink giant.
</P>
<P>
One broker said the sharp rise in Coca Cola Amatil was a
technical correction as the market over-reacted earlier in the
week to analyst recommendations of a downgrade.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index was 16.9 points higher at 4276.8
while the all resources index added 13.5 points to 1448.3.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Consolidates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Higher gold prices, a weaker New
Zealand currency and comments by a former Reserve Bank of
Australia (RBA) governor today spurred the Australian dollar to
its firmest close this week.
</P>
<P>
The local unit finished today's trading at 73.89 U.S. cents, up
from 73.67 cents Thursday. It finished just off its afternoon high
of 74.00 U.S. cents and well above its low of 73.37.
</P>
<P>
Rothschild Australia senior manager Mark McCloskey attributed
the Australian dollar's strength to good buying orders and a small
rally in the gold price.
</P>
<P>
Gold closed in Sydney today at 324.00 U.S. dollars per fine
ounce, from Thursday's close of 319.00 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
This afternoon, Bernie Fraser, former RBA governor, said he
believed the RBA had missed an opportunity to cut interest rates
for what would be a fifth time in the past year.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe a few of the offshore people have taken his comments to
heart," McCloskey suggested.
</P>
<P>
On the cross rates, the Australian dollar's most impressive
gain was against the New Zealand dollar which suffered a fall of
just less than one U.S. cent today, following a large sell
overnight order by a U.S. fund.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar also finished at 85.44 Japanese yen, down
from 85.53, and at 1.3244 German marks, down from 1.3252.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Hails General Ceasefire Accord with MILF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
hailed here today the agreement for general cessation of
hostilities signed by the government and the Muslim rebels as a
breakthrough in the peace process in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"I see this as a big leap towards the attainment of a just and
enduring peace in Mindanao," Ramos said, adding he was confident
that the "breakthrough" agreement will lead to the signing of a
final peace agreement between the government and the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF).
</P>
<P>
Because of the general ceasefire, Ramos said, the
implementation of vital government projects related to agriculture
and irrigation will be accelerated.
</P>
<P>
The government peace panel led by Fortunato Abat and the MILF
panel headed by vice chairman for political affairs Ghazali Jaafar
signed the general ceasefire agreement earlier today in Cagayan de
Oro city in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The government and the MILF agreed to commit their respective
forces to a general ceasefire effective on July 21 and direct
their respective sub-committees on ceasefire to meet soon to draw
and finalize the guidelines and rules for the implementation of
the accord.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, they also decided to resume and
proceed with the formal peace talks in a venue to be mutually
agreed upon by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The general ceasefire agreement came unexpectedly after the
MILF warned of a long deadlock in its peace talks with the
government which was stalled by the military's recent offensive
against MILF rebels.
</P>
<P>
A 12,000-member rebel group, the MILF has been fighting
government troops in the southern Philippines. It entered
low-level peace talks with Manila earlier this year, but so far
the two sides have made no substantial progress in forging a peace
agreement.

<HEADLINE> Xiaolangdi Dam Project May End Yellow River Dry Spell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese hydraulics expert has
predicted that the annual dry spell which occurs in the Yellow
River in the April-June period, a crucial season for crop growth,
will become a rarity once the Xiaolangdi Water-control Project
goes into full operation in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Xiaolangdi, located at the exit of the last gorge of the
river's middle reaches, has a designed water storage capacity of
12.65 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Once operational, it will be able to collect four billion cubic
meters of water in the winter-spring period and discharge them in
a systematic way for areas in the lower reaches during the dry
season.
</P>
<P>
By then, the irrigated areas along the river are expected to
spread from 739,000 ha to 1.52 million ha.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some large cities such as Qingdao, Tianjin, Beijing
and water-deficient areas in north China may benefit from the
project.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River, the second longest in China, has an annual
flow of 58 billion cubic meters of water, nearly half of which has
been used to sustain industrial and agricultural production and
people's everyday life.
</P>
<P>
However, over 60 percent of the river's water flows in the
July-September period each year, causing heavy floods in some
areas. But the April-June period, the high season for water
supply, receives only 20 percent of the annual total.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, drought along the upper reaches have caused
dry stretches at different sections of the waterway.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the 25 years up to 1996, the river's
lower reaches have dried up on 19 occasions, bringing about a
direct economic loss of 20 billion yuan for agricultural and
industrial production in the river basin.
</P>
<P>
This year's dry spell was longer and particularly severe, and
has attracted the attention of government officials and experts.
</P>
<P>
An expert in charge of the project said the operation of the
Xiaolangdi multi-purpose dam project would effectively solve this
long-standing problem.
</P>
<P>
In addition, people should economize on water and the central
government should unify the management of the water diversion
program from water-sufficient south China to arid north China, he
said.

<HEADLINE> China Not To Build More Oil Refineries Around 2000 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Sinopec, the flagship of China's
petrochemical industry, has announced that it will set up no new
oil refineries in the country for at least the next three years.
</P>
<P>
"We will upgrade our existing enterprises through overall
technological renovation, rather than launching new projects in
the next three years or even early in the next century," Sheng
Huaren, president of the China Petrochemical Corporation
(Sinopec), said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The reform will help Sinopec reduce its total investment in the
Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000) to 150 billion yuan (18
billion US dollars), from the previously planned 180 billion yuan,
Sheng said.
</P>
<P>
Sinopec has led the rapid growth of China's petrochemical
industry since its establishment in 1983.
</P>
<P>
The amount of processed crude oil all over the country climbed
to 118 million tons last year, from 70 million tons in 1983.
</P>
<P>
The industry produced 2.45 million tons of ethylene in 1996,
compared with 500,000 tons in 1983.
</P>
<P>
"But domestic petrochemical enterprises have to increase
economic efficiency and enhance their competitiveness since more
and more foreign companies have entered China and made market
competition even more fierce," Sheng said.
</P>
<P>
"Expanding production capacity of old enterprises through
intensive technological renovation has been proved more economical
and efficient than building new ones," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based Yanshan Petrochemical Co, for example, has
increased its annual ethylene production capacity from 300,000
tons to 650,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the company spent seven billion yuan on the whole
renovation project, compared with more than 16 billion yuan
invested in a 300,000-ton ethylene production line erected in
south China's Guangdong Province in the 1990-1995 period.
</P>
<P>
"We have introduced Yanshan's successful experience to four
other ethylene enterprises," Sheng said, pointing out that each of
them will be capable to increase annual ethylene output to 600,000
tons from the current 300,000 tons after the renovations.

Zhenhai Refinery and Petrochemical Co. in east China's Zhejiang
Province is another successful example of Sinopec's reforms.
</P>
<P>
Zhenhai has saved almost four billion yuan to double its
refining capacity of eight million tons through upgrading
technology and facilities.
</P>
<P>
"Zhenhai will be a model of not only the refinery industry, but
also other petrochemical sectors such as deep processing of
petroleum, chemical fiber and chemical fertilizer production,"
Sheng noted.
</P>
<P>
He said Sinopec's total investment in technological renovation
will surpass that of capital construction during the 1996-2000
period.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Sheng also mentioned cooperation with foreign
companies in jointly setting up advanced and large petrochemical
projects.
</P>
<P>
"We are negotiating with some big foreign firms and planning to
join hands in establishing 600,000-ton ethylene projects at
Nanjing, Shanghai, Lanzhou and Tianjin cities and in Fujian
Province," he said.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Regrets Over U.S. Anti-Dumping Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 18 (Xinhua) -- South Korea today expressed regret
over the decision of the United States not to revoke its
anti-dumping measures on South Korean-made 16 mega-D ram chips and
threatened to bring the case to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Lee Kyu-hyung said that his
government felt regretful over the decision of the U.S. Department
of Commerce to "employ the arbitrary factor of the possibility of
future dumping in order not to revoke the anti-dumping measures
against South Korean semiconductors".
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that South Korean chips have already met
the requirements for the revocation of the anti-dumping measures
when the U.S. authorities recently announced the dumping rate for
South Korean chipmakers LG and Hyundai at less than 0.5 percent
for the third consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
"South Korean government will take appropriate measures such as
suing the U.S. at the WTO on the issue," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials said that the filing will take place as soon
as possible in consultations with related ministries.
</P>
<P>
In a similar case, South Korea has filed early this month a
complaint with the WTO, demanding the U.S. lift anti-dumping
measures against South Korean color-television sets.

<HEADLINE> 16 Hamas Members Arrested by Israel Security Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli security forces have
arrested 16 members of the militant Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas) allegedly responsible for several terror attacks in the
West Bank, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Hamas cell was uncovered by Israel's secret security
apparatus General Security Service (GSS) in a recent operation,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Hamas cells' attacks along the Trans-West Bank highway had
wounded two Israeli soldiers and four civilians, an Israeli army
sources was quoted as saying. The cell members reportedly also
planned to steal weapons from Israeli soldiers and settlers for
future attacks.
</P>
<P>
Most of their attacks involved boobytrapping Israeli
installations, such as equipment belonging to Israeli electric and
telecommunications companies, and then setting off bombs when
Israeli soldiers and technicians arrived.
</P>
<P>
Following interrogation, Israeli security agents located a
large amount of homemade explosives. One member of the cell was
suspected of planting a pipe bomb earlier this year in a garbage
can in Petah Tikva, near Tel Aviv, which failed to explode.
</P>
<P>
The cell began operation in 1993, and its members, mainly
involved in disturbances, had been jailed for such activities in
the past. After their release in 1995, they resumed anti-Israeli
activities and even recruited more members into the group.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops have reportedly been put under special alert
amid rumors that Palestinian extremists may try to kidnap Israeli
soldiers to win the release of three Palestinian policemen
captured early this week by Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army said the policemen were arrested Monday night
on their way to carry out a shooting attack against a Jewish
settlement near the West Bank city Nablus. This incident sparked
loud protests from Israeli government which accused the
Palestinian National Authority (PA) of organizing terror attacks
against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dispatched Wednesday
GSS head Ami Ayaalon to Gaza to meet PNA President Yasser Arafat
on the arrest of the Palestinian policemen. Israel is reportedly
demanding Arafat take steps to prevent the re-occurrence of such
incidents.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Opens First Air-Conditioned Bus Route </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Beijing opened its first
air-conditioned bus route today running between downtown Qianmen
and the Summer Palace, a tourist attraction in the northwestern
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
The Number 808 city bus will, for the first time in Beijing's
history, offer a cool ride for passengers tired of the stifling
heat in this northern Chinese city, which is known for its
scorching summers and ice-cold winters.
</P>
<P>
"It is a bus route to cater to passengers of different
incomes," said Zheng Shusen, general manager of the Beijing Public
Traffic Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The new bus line, comprised of 25 domestic-built buses, will
start its route at 7 a.m. and end at 8:30 p.m., with stops at 13
stations, Xuanwumen, Xidan, the Beijing Zoo, the People's
University and Zhongguancun.
</P>
<P>
The ticket fair is a little bit higher than that for ordinary
buses in Beijing, but is almost the same as the price for
privately or collectively owned mini-buses, ranging from two
to six yuan, or around 24 to 72 US cents.
</P>
<P>
According to Zheng, another three to four air-conditioned bus
routes will be opened in the near future, with a total of 130
air-conditioned buses.

KAMPALA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Officials of the Democratic
Republic of Congo have ordered tens of thousands of Ugandan
refugees camped across the border to either return to Uganda or
be shifted to refugee camps inside Congo for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today said Ugandan refugees numbering
up to 35,000 who were sheltered at Kamango in Congo have been
told to shift to other refugee centers further inside Congo or
return to Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Scott Myhre, doctor of World Harvest Mission -- an American
non- governmental organization working in Bundibugyo, western
Uganda, was quoted as saying all the Congo refugee centers are
already overcrowded and it's dangerous to move additional people
into them, adding that conditions are primitive in most of Congo
following years of neglect and the war that ousted former
president of Zaire Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
He said most of the Ugandan refugees are reluctant to go to
the Congolese camps and have started returning home.
</P>
<P>
On June 16, 1997, rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces
suddenly raided and overran Uganda's west district of Bundybugyo
bordering Congo, forcing tens of thousands of Ugandans run to
neighboring Congo as refugees.

<P>
MOSCOW, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The latest decrees signed by
Russian President Boris Yeltsin are aimed at readjusting the
structure of the armed forces, cutting spendings and paving way
for further military reforms, Defense Council secretary Yuri
Baturin said today.
</P>
<P>
Explaining to the press, Baturin said that Russia will abolish
the general command of the army and replace it with the Defense
Ministry's army headquarters and combat readiness headquarters.
Both headquarters will be led by a vice defense minister.
</P>
<P>
The move is not an army reshuffle, Baturin said. It's only a
change in the commanding system of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the functions of the army's general command
and those of the Headquarters of the General Staff were somewhat
overlapped.
</P>
<P>
On the institutional reforms of the Defense Ministry, Baturin
said after streamlining, the staff of the ministry institutions
will not surpass 1 percent of the total personnel of the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
By the year 1999, the personnel of the armed forces will be
reduced to 1.2 million, he said, adding 20,000 servicemen will be
reduced this year.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Protests over U.S. Visit Restriction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Kenya has made a formal protest
to the U.S. administration for placing a quarantine on U.S.
citizens wishing to travel to the eastern African country, citing
insecurity.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. claim that "the existing" chaos make Kenya an unsafe
destination is not true and aims at tarnishing the image of the
country, Kenyan Foreign Minister Stephen Kalonzo Musyoka was
quoted by today's Kenya Times as saying.
</P>
<P>
The situation here is back to normal and tourists, investors
and other entrepreneurs should go about their business normally,
Musyoka urged Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has taken steps to facilitate dialogue
with the opposition and the "disturbances" witnessed here
recently will not recur, he assured.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Manila Describes Currency Crisis As Region-Wide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The currency crisis which marred
the local financial market is not only happening in the
Philippines but a region-wide phenomenon, Philippine Finance
Secretary Roberto de Ocampo said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a public forum, de Ocampo said the crisis started
from Thailand and is also now being felt in Southeast Asian
countries like Indonesia and Malaysia besides the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
He also traced the problem to the United States stock market,
which became so attractive to investors that big volume of dollar
transfers were pulled out of the Southeast Asia region over the
past months.
</P>
<P>
But meanwhile, de Ocampo denied reports that the Philippine
peso is overvalued, saying the crisis actually started from the
outside, such as the devaluation of the Thai baht before the
turmoil of the Manila financial market.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that the true lesson here is that the
local economy must be made stable because no country can avoid
this kind of situation in the international financial market with
a weak economy.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, an expert from the University of the
Philippines' School of Economics also echoed de Ocampo's
sentiments by hailing the government for resorting to the
depreciation of the peso against the U.S. dollar.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Assures Golan Settlers to Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 18 (Xinhua) -- On the 30th anniversary of
Israel's occupation of Golan Heights, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu assured Jewish settlers that they would remain
there for years to come.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a celebration held Thursday night in Katzrin to
mark the anniversary, Netanyahu told the settlers that the future
of Golan Heights was tied to the future of the state of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state took Golan Heights from Syria during its third
war with Arab countries which started on June 5, 1967.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to justify Israel's continued occupation, Netanyahu
noted that Golan Heights had been ruled by the Jews during
periods in ancient times.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's statements signaled that he would remain tough on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
Since assuming power last year, the Netanyahu-led Likud
government has made it clear that it would never abandon the whole
Golan Heights in future peace negotiations with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor leader Ehud Barak, who also attended the
ceremony, was booed by the residents when he said that he would
consider Israel's concessions in talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
But Barak stressed that he would not do so before making sure
that Syria reaches agreement with Israel on the crucial issues of
early-warning stations, water and normalization of ties.
</P>
<P>
Israel's previous Labor government, during its talks with
Syria, had promised a total withdrawal from Golan Heights if Syria
reaches agreements on security arrangements to guarantee Israel's
safety and agrees to sign a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Their talks, with a breakthrough in sight, came to an abrupt
stop in early March last year when the Likud was brought to power
in the Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
Syria has been demanding that the talks be resumed from the
point where they were left off, which means the Likud government
must continue committed to the promise made by its predecessor.
</P>
<P>
This was flatly by the Netanyahu government, which called for
the resumption of the talks without setting any prior conditions.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged deadlock in the peace process has led to rising
tension between the two countries, and Israel has repeatedly
charged that Syria is prepared to launch a surprise attack aimed
at reaping diplomatic gains so as to pressure Israel back to the
negotiating table.

<HEADLINE> Thai Exporters Call for Government's Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Board of Trade of Thailand has
urged the government to speed up implementation of the measures it
announced earlier to help exporters, who are affected by the
baht's float.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by representatives from the private sector
when they met senior officials of government departments concerned
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Piyabutre Cholvijarn, a Board of Trade
representative and also president of the Union Bank of Bangkok,
said the government's baht float has affected all local industries
and has resulted in an increase in inflation, production costs,
transport fees, and has stalled foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The measures announced earlier by the government include the
government's 20 billion baht (678 million US dollar) special fund
carrying an 8 percent interest rate, a tax reduction on imported
raw materials and a reduction in the rate of corporate income tax
for exporters.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, a representative of the National Economic and
Social Development Board said that as Thailand's economic growth
has been primarily export-driven, the board, which is a national
planning agency, recommended that the export sector receive the
helping hand first.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Anticipates El Nino-Triggered Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNEBSURG, July 18 (Xinhua) -- South African experts this
week voiced concern about the early build-up of the El Nino
weather phenomenon, which could spark a devastating drought in
the region next year.
</P>
<P>
Two years of soaking rains have given rise to the best crops
in years in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
But a severe El Nino, which has the potential to cause drought
in the region, would cut short the profits from this bumper run,
a local daily The Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The Pacific El Nino has developed much earlier than its usual
December arrivals and hits full steam in about January, but it is
up to full strength right now," said Mark Jury, a weather
specialist at the University of Zululand.
</P>
<P>
This century's worst El Nino hit in 1982 and 1983, sparking
hurricanes, droughts, fires and flooding in more than 15
countries.
</P>
<P>
South African government this week issued a warning that an El
Nino was on the way.
</P>
<P>
Kit le Clus, director of the National Maize Producers'
Organization, said the early appearance of El Nino created
worries over next year's maize crop, the country's biggest
agricultural commodity.
</P>
<P>
"The probability of less-than-normal maize production next
year is very strong," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Weather analysts said that in Southern Africa the impact of El
Nino would be felt hardest in Botswana, due to the development in
summer of a high pressure cell over that country.
</P>
<P>
It would then spread out affecting the northern, central and
eastern parts of South Africa and Zimbabwe, they added.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Gas Firm Face Financial Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian Tax Administration has
recently frozen the largest state gas company Ukrgazprom's bank
accounts because it owes more than 493 million hryvnas (about 274
million U.S. dollars) in taxes.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before a parliamentary session, Ukrgazprom President
Bogdan Kliuk said his company had incurred late payment fines of
284 million hryvnas (about 156 million U.S. dollars) on its 535
hryvnas (294 million dollars) debt to the state.
</P>
<P>
He linked Ukrgazprom's financial troubles to payment
delinquency by gas consumers, noting the private consumers, state
companies and municipal services have run up a 1.9 billion hryvnas
(more than 1 billion dollars) debt to Ukrgazprom for gas supplied
this year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the rate of payment by customers is worsening,
falling from 83 percent in 1995 to only 15.6 percent this year,
Kliuk said, adding that consumers still owe 2.8 billion hryvnas
(1.5 billion dollars) for gas supplied in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Ukrgazprom's lack of funds is not only holding up tax payments,
but is threatening future gas supplies to consumers, Kliuk
warned. The company is now short of cash to buy chemicals it uses
to add an odor to gas. Without these chemicals, it will be
impossible to continue supplies to consumers.
</P>
<P>
Kliuk called for a 20 to 30 percent cut in national gas
consumption and cited figures from other European countries and
around the world to support his claim that Ukrainians burn too
much gas.
</P>
<P>
He said natural gas accounts for 45.5 percent of the country's
fuel needs. In most European countries this figure is between 30
and 35 percent, and in the rest of the world only 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ukrgazprom supplied 15.5 billion cubic meters of gas worth 2.4
billion hryvnas (about 1.3 billion dollars) to consumers in the
first half of this year. Annual consumption in Ukraine is around
86 billion cubic meters, 79 percent of which is imported, said
Kliuk.

<HEADLINE> Debt Problem Eased in Shanghai's State Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The state sector in Shanghai,
once plagued by staggering debt and poor economic efficiency, has
gradually worked its way out of financial difficulty, a municipal
government official said.
</P>
<P>
The state enterprises have managed to reduce their debt ratio to
60 percent this year from the 80 percent three years ago, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
A major reason for the eased debt problem is a redistribution
and more effective use of the state assets, he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that about 800 state enterprises had been
merged by the end of last year and another 58 have gone bankrupt,
writing off about 2.63 billion yuan in bad debt reserve funds.
</P>
<P>
"How to reduce the debt ratio of the state sector is one of the
thorniest problems in the restructuring of state enterprises, but
we are getting more confident in the future with all the feasible
solutions in hand," the official said.
</P>
<P>
He added that a modern enterprise system is being introduced
into the state sector to make it more competitive.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that Shanghai will take more measures to reform the
state sector in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Official data show that the industrial sector in Shanghai has
been growing at an annual rate of over 14 percent this year, with the
sales ratio reaching 98 percent.

<HEADLINE> Direct Telecom Services Across Taiwan Straits Feasible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Post and telecom operations in
Fujian, located across the Taiwan Straits, can be linked with
their Taiwan counterparts just as soon as the time is right,
according to Shangguan Qiwen, director of the Fujian Provincial
Posts and Telecom Administration.
</P>
<P>
The director even outlined a detailed program for the direct
services, which are currently not up for consideration by the
Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
According to the program, postal ships in the future can
shuttle between Fujian, and Mazu and Jinmen.
</P>
<P>
In the realm of telecom services, both parties can make use of
microwave equipment or lay an submarine optic cable to connect
Xiamen with Jinmen.
</P>
<P>
Or, the two sides can open satellite telecom services via a
transporter either in a domestic satellite or in an international
telecom satellite. Fuzhou or Xiamen, each with a ground station,
thus can be linked with Taipei, which also has one station.
</P>
<P>
Shangguan believes the rapid development in the telecom sector
over the past years has laid a solid foundation for the future
direct services. The telephone switching capacity in the province
has hit more than four million lines. And the local mobile telecom
networks now can provide services for hundreds of thousands of
users and the paging networks have 2.6 million users.
</P>
<P>
Some 34 optical cables have been laid in the province with a
total length of more than 10,000 kilometers. Following the Xiamen
satellite ground station, another station is slated to open this
year in Fuzhou, the provincial capital.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Unified Labor Market Taking Shape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A unified labor market is taking
shape in China's largest industrial city of Shanghai, where
157,000 laid-off workers were recruited through employment
agencies in 1996, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, over 430 such agencies have been set up in the city
to provide job opportunities as well as professional training
and consultation.
</P>
<P>
All major job markets in the city are computerized, and the
Shanghai TV Station has joined the market by broadcasting 600
items of job-related information every day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the municipal government is now releasing forecasts
on the supply and demand of laborers. The three most common job
vacancies are for shop assistants, cashiers and hotel attendants.
</P>
<P>
And job consultation, which has appeared along with the
expanding labor market, has become a new profession in
Shanghai. There are currently nearly 3,000 consultants in the city
and at least 30,000 locals have been re-employed with help from
the experts.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the local labor market has also accelerated
the pace of bankrupting and merging of local money-losing
enterprises. By the end of 1996, 58 state firms had declared
bankruptcy and more than 730 local companies had been merged,
which has saved nearly eight billion yuan-worth of idle assets of
state companies.

<P>
WELLINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from warring
factions of Bougainville Island voiced their desire today to work
together for peace on the war-torn island in Papua New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
The representatives, meeting at Burnham camp in New Zealand's
South Island city of Christchurch for the past two weeks,
expressed the desire in the "Burnham Declaration" they signed this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
They believe that all sides now have a common will to see an
end to the civil war ranging on the cooper-rich island since 1988.
</P>
<P>
Satisfied with the results of the NZ-brokered talks, NZ Foreign
Minister Don Mckinnon said the declaration is a very strong
foundation on which a peace strategy can be pursued.
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty satisfied that they are heading in the right
direction, but this is still the first step in bringing the
Bougainville people together."
</P>
<P>
He envisaged another, smaller group representing the factions
will need to meet again before the PNG government joins the
discussions.
</P>
<P>
But it has yet to be decided if New Zealand will continue to be
the venue of future talks.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Meets Japan's LDP Secretary-General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
today that both Chinese and Japanese, especially statesmen of the
two countries, should learn from events in history and work
together for the development of sound and stable bilateral
relations in the future.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee, made the remark here this morning when meeting
with Kato Koichi, secretary-general of Japan's Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP).
</P>
<P>
Extending a welcome to Kato and the LDP delegation, Jiang said
that this year is the 25th anniversary of the normalization of
Sino-Japanese diplamatic relations, and that China is willing to
join hands with Japan's ruling party and Japanese friends from
all walks of life to safeguard and develop the sort of bilateral
friendly situation that is not easy to come by.
</P>
<P>
China is also willing to make joint efforts with the Japanese
friends to build more effective Sino-Japanese relations for the
next century, so as to make greater contributions to the peace,
stability and development in Asia and the world at large, he added.
</P>
<P>
As the history cannot be changed, he pointed out, the past may
be used as a mirror with which to closely examine what has
happened.
</P>
<P>
To correctly understand the past and summarize historical
lessons are conducive to an accurate understanding of the
development trend of the future, and will help to create a better
future for bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing with Jiang on his repeated comment that "an overturned
cart ahead is a warning to carts behind," Kato noted that Japan
will persist in taking the route of peaceful development and stick
to a foreign policy of peace.
</P>
<P>
Kato said, "We shall redouble our efforts for a friendly
relationship for the future to be forged by younger generations of
the two countries."
</P>
<P>
Extending congratulations again on China's resumption of the
exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong, Kato sincerely hoped
that the great concept of "one country, two systems" will succeed.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his appreciation for Kato's remarks.

PRAGUE, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Czech government adopted a
series of measures Wednesday to help the flood-hit areas resume
production and rebuild homes, a government spokesman said
today.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Environmental Protection Jiri Skalicky was sent to

receive 150,000 korun (about 4,545 dollars) from the government as
well as 850,000 korun (about 25,758 dollars) of low interest loans
to rebuild their house.

<HEADLINE> India's Private Firms Allowed to Own Satellites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 18 (Xinhua)-- India's union government has
ended state monopoly of satellite usage and ownership by allowing
private firms to use Insat transponders and permitting them to own
satellites, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Under a new policy of the government, Indian private companies
will be allowed to own and operate satellites for which the
Department of Telecommunications will facilitate allocation of
frequencies.
</P>
<P>
Private Indian satellites will be treated as national
satellites and will enjoy the country's protection in terms of
orbital slots. The union government will register these satellites
with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).
</P>
<P>
The new policy, which was approved by the union cabinet last
week, also allows operations of foreign satellites from Indian
soil in terms of satellite control and unlinking/down linking. But
Indian satellites will be accorded preferential treatment. This
means that Indian satellites, Insats, will have the first right to
choose frequencies.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the new policy will lead to the development
of a healthy and thriving communications satellite and ground
equipment industry as well as satellite communications service
industry in India, the Indian Space Research Organization said in
a statement.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Drought is threatening large areas
of farmland in Thailand as seasonal rains are late in coming.
</P>
<P>
Crops such as sugarcane, maize and soybean have been hard hit
by the unseasonable long dry spell.
</P>
<P>
More than 640,000 hectares of farmland in 22 provinces, in
particular in the north and northeast, have been affected,
according to Agriculture Ministry officials.
</P>
<P>
The rainy season normally starts in May, but this year the dry
spell has been prolonged and normal rainfall is not expected until
August in many areas.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has told farmers to postpone their first rice crop
planting until August.
</P>
<P>
It has also sought 594 million baht (20 million U.S. dollars)
for emergency relief.
</P>
<P>
The money would be used to buy seeds, fertilizer and pesticide
for farmers stricken by the lack of seasonal rains.
</P>
<P>
As a result of crop damage, maize output this year could be 20
percent below projection, a Commerce Ministry official said. And
sugarcane output would be 10 percent below target, an industry
source estimated.
</P>
<P>
However, it is hoped that the crop damage could be compensated
by replanting or by a second cropping, when rainfall becomes
regular and sufficient.

KIEV, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's population has dropped by
2.3 percent to 50.2 million this year from 52 million in 1991, a
government official said today.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the average life expectancy for Ukrainians has
shortened by 3.5 years. The average life span is 61.2 years for
men and 62.7 years for women, according to Nikolai Soldatenko,
head of the Social Security Department under the Economy Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The population will be further reduced by 4 million by 2026, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Public Health Minister Andrei Serdiuk attributed the population
reduction mainly to infectious diseases and insufficient fund for
residents to get medicines.
</P>
<P>
Some 8.5 million people were registered suffering from
infectious diseases, he said.
</P>
<P>
Within the next 30 years, the number of children under the age
of 15 will decrease by some 3 million and constitute only 16.8
percent of the population, compared with 21.6 percent at present,
Soldatenko said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the number of people aged between 15 and 49 will
decrease by 2.5 million, while residents above 60 will make up 30
percent of the population, much higher than the 21.2 percent for
the time being.

PANAMA CITY, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian Foreign Minister
Ricardo Alberto Arias said today that his country and the United
States are negotiating on setting up an anti-drug center in the
U.S. Howard Air Base on the banks of the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
Arias said that the two governments agreed Tuesday to start
formal negotiations to establish a multilateral center against
drug trafficking in Panama.
</P>
<P>
The two governments had negotiated the matter in an informal
way, but no concrete results were obtained, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian government set up a negotiating commission
conisting of Jorge Ritter, Minister of State for Canal Affairs,
Adolfo Ahumada, Foreign Ministry counselor, and lawyer Eloy
Alfaro.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations will be bilateral in principle, Ritter
said. Other countries which are interested in participating in the
center can join the negotiations later.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the center was proposed by Panamanian
President Ernesto Perez Balladares during a meeting of the Group
of Rio in September 1995, said Arias.
</P>
<P>
"It is convenient to establish the center taking advantage of
the Howard Air Base installations," he said. The base is located

<HEADLINE> NATO Expansion Creates New Problems, Russian PM Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 17 (Xinhua) -- NATO's eastward expansion has not
solved existing problems, but created new ones, Russian Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said here today.
</P>
<P>
The military bloc's expansion into Eastern Europe has turned
the plan to change its military and political structures and its
strategic conception into something in the distant future,
Chernomyrdin told the Interfax news agency before leaving for
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Wednesday that
Russia remains opposed to NATO's eastward expansion and this
position will not change.
</P>
<P>
At a summit in Madrid earlier this month, NATO invited Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic to join the military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Knowing that the three countries would join the alliance at its
Madrid summit, President Boris Yeltsin decided not to attend the
meeting, Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia does not doubt the necessity of building an
equal partnership of cooperation with NATO.
</P>
<P>
NATO's expansion has become an objective reality, and Russia
has to make efforts to adapt itself to the reality, he said.
</P>
<P>
The signing of a Founding Act on May 27, which establishes a
new post-Cold War Russia-NATO relationship, reduces to the minimum
the unfavorable military consequences from the expansion upon
Russia, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Russia-Japan relations, he said Russia is seeking to sign a
peace treaty with Japan on the basis that neither country's
national dignity is damaged.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the inaugural meeting of the NATO-Russia partnership
council, established following the signing of the Founding Act,
has been postponed after a wrangle over the chairmanship, reports
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The council was to have met in Brussels Thursday, but NATO and
Russia have been unable to agree on the mechanics of how a
rotating presidency involving both sides would work in practice,
the reports said.

<P>
VIENNA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of lacking
sincerity and wanting to destroy the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Austrian daily newspaper Die Presse
published today, Arafat said, "Netanyahu does not want peace; on
the contrary he is destroying the peace process."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader, who visited Austria Tuesday and
Wednesday, also condemned Israel's recent arrest of Palestinian
policemen, saying such an act violated the autonomy accord.
</P>
<P>
But Arafat added that most Israelis are supporting the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been stalled since the
Jewish state began construction in March of a housing settlement
for around 30,000 people in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Austria, Arafat met with Austrian
Chancellor Viktor Klima, National Council President Heinz Fischer
and Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian leaders said they support the peace process
and the U.N. resolution condemning Israel's settlement policies in
the Palestinian territories.
</P>

Arafat hoped the European Union and Austria would pressure on
Israel and revive the deadlocked Middle East peace process.

BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Dang Kang no longer fears
answering his teachers' questions during classroom
instructions. He now smiles.
</P>
<P>
The 10-year-old boy was abandoned by his parents because he was
born with a cleft palate. The couple who adopted him were too poor
to afford the expensive surgery -- until the China Charity
Federation (CCF) stepped in.
</P>
<P>
Dang is one of 1,849 children who have regained their smiles
after having face-lift operations funded by CCF. About 1,200 more
cleft palate-afflicted orphans are on the organization's plan for
this year, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"If chance permits, we hope to extend the project from orphans
to afflicted children in poor families," said Cui Naifu, president
of the federation.
</P>
<P>
The federation, a free bridge joining loving hearts and the
needy, is trying to include more people in their programs.
</P>
<P>
It plans to support 10,000 families in China's drought-stricken
northwestern area by helping dig water cellars this year, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Each cellar will cost 800 yuan (96.40 US dollars). The expense
may be paid by one donor or shared by two, and donors' names will
be engraved on the cellar, Cui said.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing's rural area, 2,500 poor students have recently been
paired with people who will finance their schooling.

Established in 1994, the CCF is the first national charity
organization and the biggest nongovernmental, non-profit

JAKARTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from Thursday's
crash of an Indonesian plane in West Java rose to 26 today, Antara
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A fokker-27 plane of Sempati Airline crashed ten minutes after
takeoff from Bandung, West Java, at 11:45 a.m., killing at least
26 people including five crew, and injuring 26 others.
</P>
<P>
The plane, which was going to Jakarta, capital of Indonesia,
crashed near a housing complex just after takeoff from the Husein
Sastranegara Airport in Bandung.
</P>
<P>
Transportation Minister Haryanto Dhanutirto, who arrived on the
scene 15 minutes after the incident, said the pilot, F.X. Banbang,
reported engine trouble to the control tower before the plane went
down.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps the pilot attempted to make an emergency landing at
Sulaeman airport," Dhanutirto said. Sulaeman airport is located
just 200 meters from the crash site.
</P>
<P>
The fokker-27 is a twin-turboprop plane that can carry up to 52
passengers.
</P>
<P>
The accident was the third domestic plane crash in three
months.

<HEADLINE> Peru to Enforce Fishing Closed Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A closed season on the capture of
anchovy will be in force starting Friday along its shores,
Peruvian Fishing Ministry announced.
</P>
<P>
The Fishing Ministry said the decision was adopted in
accordance with the recommendation of the Peruvian Institute of
the Sea, which said that the effects of the El Nino have disrupted
the distribution and concentration patterns of the anchovy.
</P>
<P>
El Nino is a warm inshore current annually flowing south along
the coast of Ecuador and about every seven to ten years, extending
down the coast of Peru, where it has devastating effect on fish,
weather and crops.
</P>
<P>
"This puts the stocks in very unstable conditions to sustain
the next fishing seasons, taking into account also that the
established capture quotas have been fulfilled," added the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian Sea Institute research has shown that the El Nino
phenomenon has affected negatively the fishing resources,
especially anchovy, which has caused a lack of renewal of the
adult stock, which diminished the rate of reproduction.

WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Medicare, the federal health
insurance program in the United States, improperly paid 23 billion
dollars last year, government auditors said.
</P>
<P>
That means 14 cents of every dollar spent by the government's
largest health care program was lost to fraud, abuse or simple
errors.
</P>

Members of a House subcommittee said the audit underscored the
need for the Health and Human Services Department (HHS) to
exercise much stronger controls to root out payment problems.
</P>

HHS Inspector General June Gibbs Brow, whose office conducted
the audit, said an estimated 23.2 billion, or 14 percent, of the
168.6 billion dollars Medicare paid in 1996 to health care
providers including hospitals, doctors and labs was improper.
</P>
<P>
The audit report was released Thursday at a meeting of House
Ways and Means health subcommittee. Lawmakers recently drafted a
balanced-budget plan to reduce spending on Medicare by 115 billion
dollars over the next five years because the health program for
the elderly and disabled is in danger of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Since it was created three decades ago, Medicare has grown to
serve more than 38 million people who generate 800 million medical
bills a year.
</P>
<P>
The most persistent problem found was bills submitted by health
care providers to the government with insufficient or no
documentation of the care provided -- accounting for nearly half
of all improper payments.
</P>
<P>
Other irregularities include bills for medically unnecessary
treatment, for treatment that Medicare does not cover, and bills
for expensive services when cheaper treatment was actually
provided.
</P>
<P>
Brown said the audit did not distinguish whether errors were
honest mistakes or attempted fraud but she said providers were
getting more aggressive in their efforts to maximize profits.
</P>
<P>
Advocates for the nation's hospitals maintain Medicare's
complicated, bureaucratic billing system is to blame.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Extends Debt Payment to Poland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sofia, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian government extended
the July 31 deadline for the settlement of the Bulgarian debt to
Poland worth some 100 million transferable roubles by the year's
end, Minister of Trade and Tourism Valentin Vassilev told the
government's press office.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria is repaying its debt in farm and tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
Poland and Hungary insist that Bulgaria must repay its debts
towards them prior to the signing of an agreement on the
establishment of free trade areas with them. The signing of this
agreement is related to Bulgaria's admission as a full member of
the Central European Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
In a joint report delivered Thursday Minister of Trade and
Tourism Valentin Vassilev and Finance Minister Mouravei Radev
propose that this country's debts towards Poland and Hungary worth
195.3 million transferable roubles are further settled in goods
and services. The report was moved to the Council of Ministers,
the Trade Ministry press office said.
</P>
<P>
Under protocols signed in 1991, Bulgaria is committed to
settle trade deficits, accumulated in the period of rouble
payments, in goods and services according to 1990 prices. The
debts should have been settled by the end of 1991 and the
remaining amount paid in convertible currency. However the
condition for the recalculation of the outstanding amounts in
hard currency is unfavourable for Bulgaria and the country has not
yet accepted it, the two ministers' joint report says.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Americans to Confront Racial Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Thursday called on Americans to confront "often painful issues" of
race so that they won't destroy the country's future.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the National Association of Black Journalists in
Chicago, the president said he is "a little stumped" by the
"shocking" consequences of plunging minority graduate school
enrollments in California and Texas, where affirmative action
programs were ended.
</P>
<P>
A formal effort to redress past discrimination, Affirmative
action aims at ensuring blacks and other historically
disadvantaged groups equal access to employment, educational, and
business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand that," news reports quoted Clinton as
saying. "It's a great concern to me. I think it is moving the
country in exactly the wrong direction."
</P>
<P>
He said the fact that significantly fewer minorities will
attend law schools in those two states next year shows what can
happen when Americans fail to talk out and resolve racial
problems.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "We really have not only an opportunity but an
obligation to address and to better resolve the vexing,
perplexing, often painful issues surrounding our racial history
and our future."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China, the
central bank, has promulgated a set of rules to improve financial
supervision and perfect internal control in financial
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The rules consist of the planning, operation and reporting on
the bank's financial supervision, and will enable the bank to
improve its overall supervision over the financial market by
providing clear guidance as to what the bank should accomplish
through the whole procedure, said a central bank official.
</P>
<P>
The rules regard the financial control by the central bank as
an inseparable part of its work, and call for smooth information
exchanges and close cooperation between its supervisory body and
other departments.

In another effort to improve its financial control, the central
bank issued regulations governing the settlement through credit
card, which will go into effect in August.
</P>
<P>
The regulations stipulate that only commercial banks and their
branches with central bank approval may handle the business of
settlement through credit card, which is restricted to financial
transfer and can't be used for cash withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, unauthorized commercial banks, urban and rural
cooperative banks and other non-financial institutions are banned
from the business.

<HEADLINE> Russia Calls for Cooperation with EU in Fighting Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin Thursday stressed the need for his country to
cooperate more closely with the European Union in fighting
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
EU member states should sign cooperation agreements with
Russia, and interior and judicial departments of the two sides
should increase their contact, Chernomyrdin told the Interfax news
agency.
</P>
<P>
Russia and EU members should make concerted efforts to combat
organized crime, and Russia's law-enforcement authorities and
secret service departments are ready to further cooperate with the
EU in fighting organized crime, smuggling, illegal weapons
shipment and drugs, he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister noted that Russia's criminal law has come
into effect this year, and "more important laws" are to be passed,
including documents on fighting organized crime.
</P>
<P>
The country has adopted a series of measures on fighting crime,
and some 55,000 criminals have been convicted over the past four
years, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the increase in economic and bribery crimes
have seriously affected the nation's image, trade and investment
environment.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the crime rate in Russia is lower than that in
the United States and Germany, he added. In Russia, the annual
rate is 1,800 cases per 100,000 people, while in the U.S., the
rate stands at 15,000 cases, and in Germany, 8,300 cases.

<HEADLINE> Employees in Shijiazhuang Pleased With Medical Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A medical insurance system is
now in place for the 130,000 employees of government offices and
State-owned enterprises and institutions in the capital city of
north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
It's a switch from the former medical care system, under which
those working for the government or State-owned enterprises and
institutions received medical treatment funded entirely by the
State.
</P>
<P>
The new system is based on a medical insurance fund set up
with an initial investment from the local government, into which
every unit turns in an amount equivalent to 10 percent of the
total waves of all its employees for the previous year, while
each employee pays one percent of his wages or salary.
</P>
<P>
Every person participating in the project has his own medical
account in the bank, and is entitled to reimbursement for medical
expenses, said Xing Hongshan, director of Hebei's Medical
Insurance Managing Center.
</P>
<P>
He added that people are no longer limited to only one or two
hospitals as they used to be. They can go to any hospital included
on the hospital's computer network.
</P>
<P>
The network can report violations of regulations to the center
at any time and can be used to audit the medical accounts and to
provide information about medical insurance.
</P>
<P>
China started to reform its medical care system in the
1980s, since the former State-subsidized system, which came into
being in the early 1950s when a planned economy was practiced
in China, was putting too much strain on State and local coffers.
</P>
<P>
Shijiazhuang is the first provincial capital among the 58
cities chosen to adopt medical insurance.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, those who enjoy free medical care in
the city will have changed to the new medical insurance and the
system soon will be introduced to urban and rural residents across
the country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sends Solarz to Asia on Cambodia Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States is sending
former congressman Stephen Solarz to Asia as a special envoy on a
mission for a resolution to the recent Cambodia crisis, the State
Department said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Solarz will visit China, Japan, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia
and Cambodia, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Solarz will discuss with leaders of these
countries "how best to uphold and restore the principles of the
1991 Paris peace accords so that all Cambodian parties can
operate freely and free and fair elections can take place in
1998," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
He was at the request of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
"to explore possible resolution of the crisis in Cambodia," Burns
continued.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will hold a
meeting later this month and Cambodia will be high on the agenda
when the gathering is under way.
</P>
<P>
Albright "felt strongly that we had to have a series of
diplomatic conversations with ASEAN countries as well as Hun Sen
to ... make sure we had best possible framework" going into
ASEAN, Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Burns described Solarz's appointment as a "one trip" mission,
not a permanent appointment.

MEXICO CITY, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Bank robbers have looted more

It says there is a 7.4 percent increase in bank assaults so far

robbed from 38 bank loots last year was 14 million pesos (about
1.8 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Britain Announces Dates for Polls in Scotland, Wales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The British government today
announced dates of referendums in Scotland and Wales on plans to
give the two nations their own parliaments.
</P>
<P>
Scottish Secretary Donald Dewar said the plebiscite in Scotland
will take place on September 11 and a similar poll on the setting
up of a Welsh senate will be held a week later.
</P>
<P>
The plans for so-called "devolution" were a key issue in
Britain's May 1 election, with the Conservatives warning that the
government's plans were the first step on a slippery slope towards
the break-up of Britain.
</P>
<P>
In the referendum, Scottish voters will be asked to endorse the
government's plans for the new parliament to control most of
Scotland's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Home Secretary Jack Straw announced that legislation
will be introduced soon to allow all Britain's 87 members of the
European Parliament to be chosen by a proportional representation
(PR) system for the first time in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Britain is at present the odd member state out in the European
Union in electing most of its MEPs by a first-past-the-post
system, although the three Northern Irish members have always been
elected by PR.
</P>
<P>
First-past-the-post gives larger parties a big advantage, and
helped the ruling Labor Party to win 62 seats at the last European
parliament elections in 1994.

<HEADLINE> EU Publishes Report on Youth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Young people in the European
Union (EU) countries are staying longer in education, taking
longer to cross from training to work, and waiting longer before
starting families, it was learned here today.
</P>
<P>
Age at which at least 50 percent of young people have a job or
are seeking one rose from 18 in 1987 to 20 in 1995, according to a
report by Eurostat, the EU's statistical office.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 60 percent of the 18-year-olds in the EU countries were
in education or training. Belgium had the highest rate of 88
percent while the lowest rate of the kind -- 38 percent -- was
registered in the UK.
</P>
<P>
Across the EU, 17 percent of the 18-year-olds combined training
with work, usually part-time, says the report.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the issue of unemployment became a big worry for the
EU's young people. Between 1991 and 1995, the jobless rate of
young people under the age of 25 rose in all EU member states
except Denmark and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The report says that when young people were asked about the
main difficulties they faced, 70 percent of them put unemployment
at the top of the list. Next came inadequate education or
training.
</P>
<P>
Between 1960 and 1980, young people tended to leave their
parents' homes early, the report says. But this trend changed in
the following decade, particularly for those aged 25 to 29 in
southern member states.
</P>
<P>
Living together outside marriage is very common in Denmark,
France and the UK but is rare in Ireland and southern member
states such as Portugal and Italy.
</P>
<P>
There are around 50 million people aged 15 to 24 in the EU
countries, who account for 14 percent of the whole population.
This rises to 80 million if people aged 25 to 29 are included.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar rose against the
Japanese yen in New York Thursday after Japan said its trade
surplus did not widen in June as much as traders had feared.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also ended higher against the German mark and Swiss
franc.
</P>
<P>
In late afternoon trading in New York, the dollar cost 116.07
yen, up from 115.52 yen Wednesday. It cost 1.7941 marks, up from
1.7906, and 1.4828 Swiss francs, up from 1.4760. The pound
weakened to 1.6722 U.S. dollars from 1.6784 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose on the news that Japan's unadjusted trade
surplus grew to 934.21 billion yen in June. That was up 27.7
percent from a year earlier but well below economists'
expectations.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the dollar hit a six-year high against the mark,
topping 1.8000 marks, amid strong optimism in New York about the
health of the U.S. economy, the strong U.S. stock market and doubts
about Europe's single currency.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the dollar has encountered resistance when it
surpasses the 1.8000 mark level.
</P>
<P>
Other dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday: 6.0550
French Francs, up from 6.0435; 2,744.50 Italian lire, up from
1,738.00; and 1.3773 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3737.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Now people are able to move out
of the chaotic chat room on the Internet and enter a more personal
on-line chat, with the introduction of some new software.
</P>
<P>
Until recently, if people want to enter a talk with someone
over the net, he or she has to first get into a chat room where
dozens of people talking things of their interest, a difficult
environment for a discussion just between two or three.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal reported that there is a new kind of
chat designed for one-to-one communication with someone you know.
These new chat setups are more like a phone call with a friend or
colleague.
</P>
<P>
Consumers say they are finding myriad uses for small, private
on-line discussions. Some companies see opportunities to build the
capability into business software.
</P>
<P>
Before long, advocates say, electronic chats will seem as
indispensable as electronic mail, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
About a half-dozen companies have put up such software on the
Internet for free downloading. They say that several million users
are already chatting away, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The instant reply of on-line chat provides more convenience
than e-mail, in which the mail sender seldom knows whether his or
her message has been received and read.

<HEADLINE> Jansher to Compete in Hong Kong Open Squash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 17 (Xinhua) -- World number one Jansher Khan of
Pakistan will lead 23 of the world's top 24 players in the
upcoming Hong Kong Open Squash tournament slated through August
24-31, according to local press on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The only one in the top 24 stars to miss the Hong Kong event is
world No. 11 Dan Jenson of Australia, who has an ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
Jansher Khan Wednesday withdrew from the 22,000 U.S. dollars
Australian Open, to stay in Karachi with his pregnant wife. This
move leaves only two players in the top 10 for the event.
</P>
<P>
Jansher Khan emerged to the world scene after his triumph in
the 1987 tournament here, where he defeated legendary compatriot
Jahangir Khan in the semi-finals on his way to the title.
</P>
<P>
Among those returning to this year's event here are world No. 3
and defending champion Rodney Eyles of Australia, who produced a
shock at last year's tournament when he stopped Khan from taking
his eighth title, and also world No. 2 Peter Nicol of Scotland and
No. 5 Jonathon Power from Canada.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Pleased with EU Accession, Peace March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus said today that it is
pleased with the progress in its accession to the European Union
(EU) and the efforts to end the country's ethnic conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Manolis Christofides made the remark at
his daily press briefing here today, adding "a lot of caution is
needed by all in order to cover the distance toward these two
goals."
</P>
<P>
This was against the backdrop that the European Commission
confirmed Tuesday that EU accession talks with Cyprus and other
five Eastern European states will start next year, and leaders of
the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides opened direct negotiations
near New York under the U.N. sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
President Glafcos Clerides and the Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash decided at the face-to-face talks that they will hold
second round of talks in Geneva between August 11 and 16.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that by December all details regarding
accession talks with the EU will be known, as the
Inter-governmental Conference (IGC) will formally end in October.
</P>
<P>
The EU decided in March 1995 that accession negotiations will
begin with Cyprus six months after the end of the IGC.
</P>
<P>
Christofides reiterated that a solution to the Cyprus problem
will help Cyprus' bid to join the EU, but stressed that even if
there is no solution reached at that time accession talks will
begin.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also urged Turkey to change its attitude for the
sake of its own European course.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, which was reportedly excluded from the EU accession
talks, has threatened to annex the northern part of the island if
Cyprus joins the EU.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been partitioned since 1974 when Turkish troops
took over the northern third of the island following a failed
coup by Greek Cypriots allied with the military junta that ruled
Greece at the time.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Members Urged to Respect UN Observers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 17 (xinhua) -- Angola's former rebel movement
UNITA today appealed to all its members and supporters to respect
the United Nations observers and officials from humanitarian
organizations, the Angola News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued in its headquarters in Angola's central
city Bailundo, the Political Committee of the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) expressed its regret
over the incident that a helicopter of the United Nations
Observers Mission was detained on July 11 in Angola's northeastern areas
under UNITA control.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that the incident has damaged the image of
the UNITA and pledged that such an incident will not happen any
longer.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA urged all its members, supporters and residents
under its control to strictly respect the UN observers, members
of non-government organizations and their properties. Any
offender will be punished, added the communique.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the UNITA soldiers have twice detained UN aircraft
and their crew members, and also have abused the UN and NGO
staffs and confiscated their properties. On monday, the UN
Observers Mission issued a statement, condemning the acts of
UNITA soldiers and requesting the UNITA to take measures to
prevent such acts from happening again.

NICOSIA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia's special envoy on Cyprus
Vladimir Tchizhov arrived here today for talks with Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters upon his arrival that the purpose of his
visit is to continue the meetings he had in New York with the two
leaders and exchange views with them on the outcome of the first
round of direct talks between Clerides and Denktash which was
held in Troutbeck, near New York, from July 9 to 12.

The second round of U.N.-led face-to-face talks between
Clerides and Denktash is scheduled to take place in Montreux,

<HEADLINE> Clinton Nominates Shelton to Be Top US Military Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today nominated four-star Army Gen. Henry Shelton to be the next
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the president's top
military adviser.
</P>
<P>
"He has distinguished himself as a decorated soldier," Clinton
said at a White House Rose Garden ceremony attended also by the
current Joint Chiefs chairman, Army Gen. John Shalikashvili, who
is scheduled to retire at the end of September.
</P>
<P>
"From Vietnam to Desert Storm he has proven his skill and
courage in combat," Clinton said, adding that Shelton was a
"thinker" with a "unique perspective" on security challenges
expected to face America in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Shelton, 55, a 34-year veteran who commanded the U.S. military
operation in Haiti three years ago, now heads the Special
Operations Command, an elite group of 47,000 Army Navy and Air
Force troops which was created in 1987 under legislation sponsored
by then-Sen. William Cohen of Maine, now the defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
If confirmed by the Senate, Shelton would be the third
consecutive Army general to serve as chairman, behind
Shalikashvili and Gen. Colin Powell.
</P>
<P>
Shelton is considered a decisive and combat-tested leader, a
commander of helicopter forces in the Persian Gulf War and in the
Army's Green Berets in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Like Powell and Shalikashvili, Shelton is not a graduate of
West Point, the Army's military academy. He graduated from North
Carolina State University. He was born in Tarboro, North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
In a recent article on his command published by the Pentagon,
Shelton said the United States must prepare itself for a new era
in which terrorism, ethnic conflict and even the threats of
chemical, biological and cyberspace warfare could arise.
</P>
<P>
Shelton noted his troops "are not designed to win wars
single-handedly, but they can help prevent and deter them." For
the next decade, the nation can expect that "operations short of
war" will dominate its security concerns, he added.
</P>
<P>
Shelton was chosen as the candidate for the chairman after the
candidacy of Air Force Gen. Joseph Ralston was scuttled by his
disclosure of an adulterous affair.

HARARE, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The two-day Bio-medical Research
and Training Institute (BRTI) meeting ended here today with a
call for the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
states to cooperate in improving the quality of health in the region.
</P>
<P>
Namibia's Permanent Secretary of Health and Social Services
Kalemba Shangula told the closing session that SADC governments
should provide adequate funds for the setting up of a regional
research and training health center.
</P>
<P>
"What is clear in the region is that, given the present
research environment of limited financial and human resources,
organizations like BRTI can play a major role in harnessing the
potential that we have within the SADC community," said Shangula.
</P>
<P>
Professor Wen Kalima of Tanzania said organizations such as
BRTI should help African scientists by lobbying their respective
governments for better pay to plug the brain drain.
</P>
<P>
He said it was essential that governments in the region should
support research relevant both to the region and globally.
</P>
<P>
BRTI, which aims to collaborate with institutes and
laboratories of the SADC, is a regional research and training
institute formed two years ago to spearhead a common approach to
the region's health problems.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Strongly Against EU-Proposed Farm Subsidy Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The German government today expressed
firm opposition to European Union (EU) proposals to reduce farm
subsidies which currently account for about half of the EU's 86
billion ECU (78 billion US dollar) annual budget.
</P>
<P>
German Agriculture Minister Jochen Borchert described the
radical proposals as "superfluous," "contradictory" and comprising
"a grave change which disadvantages the German farmer and
taxpayer."
</P>
<P>
He noted that neither the planned EU eastward expansion nor
negotiations with the World Trade Organization could justify the
proposals, which were put forward by EU commission president
Jacques Santer and EU farm commissioner Franz Fischler.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposals, a one-third cut would come as a result in
prices EU guaranteed to its farmers, and the farmers would be
compensated through increased direct aid payments.
</P>
<P>
The EU guaranteed prices are above those in the global markets.
Bochert said that he was particularly opposed to reducing the
guaranteed prices for beef, grain and milk.
</P>
<P>
There are currently fears in the EU of a soaring farm subsidy
bill and more excess of farm products priced out of global markets
as a result of the rising EU agricultural production and the
future entry into the EU of such big farming nations as Poland.
</P>
<P>
Borchert said that he saw no need at present for a major reform
of the Common Agricultural Policy.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Ruling Party Softens Tune on Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's ruling party Kenya
African National Union (KANU) today recommended the government
propose a bill in parliament for enactment of a commission to
review the constitution and make proposals.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Vice-President George Saitoti, who is also KANU's
Vice-President, said that the ruling party suggested the
government issue a Statute Law bill in the current session of the
parliament to allow the repeal or amendment of laws charged as
oppressive.
</P>
<P>
The laws charged as oppressive include the Public Order Act on
public rallies, the Preservation of Public Security Act which
allows detention without trial, as well as other nine laws, said
Saitoti at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"They (opposition parties) asked for so-called minimum
constitutional reforms. We have not only agreed to these, but
have also proposed that comprehensive reforms be examined,"
Nicholas Biwott, a powerful minister of state, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The KANU National Executive Council (NEC) has "reaffirmed the
commitment that there should be free and fair elections in a
peaceful atmosphere," said Saitoti.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti's statement is seen as one of remarkable signals that
the government is softening its stance on the constitutional
reforms demanded by opposition parties soon after nationwide
violent confrontation between the two sides claimed 14 lives on
July 7.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi met with opposition leader in
parliament Kijana Wamalwa on Wednesday and 17 key Christian and
Moslem religious leaders on Tuesday over the constitutional
reforms.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that time and mechanism for affecting
constitutional reforms would be discussed in subsequent meetings,
one of them expected to be held next week.
</P>
<P>
Moi also announced on Wednesday that the public rallies
licences will be automatically granted on application, regarded
as a key concession to the reform demands.
</P>
<P>
From May to July, violence has been escalating when the
opposition repeatedly tried to hold rallies without governmental
permits in a bid to press for constitutional reforms before the
general elections. All the rallies were broken up by the police.
</P>
<P>
Under the current constitution, any candidate, if he wins no
less than 25 percent of votes respectively in five of the eight
provinces of Kenya, he can be qualified as a legal president.
</P>
<P>
Now the opposition leaders urged to change the clause,
demanding the future president get more than 50 percent of the
total votes nationwide, otherwise form a coalition government
with other parties. But this has been refused by Moi.

new statistics published today.
</P>
<P>
It is an increase of over 18,000 enterprises since the start of
1995, showed the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) statistics for
the UK, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Statistical Bulletin contained a size breakdown of the
number of businesses in the UK, from small traders with no
employees to those with 500 or more employees.
</P>
<P>
It also showed the contribution to employment and turnover made
by businesses of different sizes, industry by industry.
</P>
<P>
Of the 3.7 million businesses in 1996, over 2.5 million were
"size class zero" business -- those made up of sole traders or
partners without employees.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the 1.2 million businesses with employees were
small (fewer than 50 employees). Only 26,000 were medium sized (50
to 249 employees) and almost 7,000 were large (250 or more
employees).
</P>
<P>
Small businesses, including those without employees, accounted
for over 99 percent of businesses, 46 percent of non-government
employment and (excluding the finance sector) 38 percent of
turnover.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the 7,000 largest business accounted for 42
percent of non-government employment and 44 percent of turnover.
</P>
<P>
At the start of 1996, at least 99 percent of businesses in all
but one industry sector were SMEs. In the exception, the
electricity, gas and water supply sector, only 85.7 percent of
businesses were SMEs, a decline from 90 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The share of employment in small businesses was higher than
average in agriculture, forestry and fishing and in most service
industries at the start of 1996. Small businesses continued to
dominate employment in the construction industry.
</P>
<P>
Some industries were still relatively dominated by medium and
large sized businesses; they are electricity, gas and water
supply, mining and quarrying, manufacturing and financial
intermediation.

<HEADLINE> UK High Divorce Rate Blamed for Drink Toll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain's divorce rate, which is
the highest in Europe, is believed to be part of the causes for a
rise in deaths from drink-related diseases in the country.
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Chick, a leading specialist in alcohol dependency and
senior lecturer at Edinburgh University, said Wednesday that
alcohol is increasingly a problem among the UK's single parents
and people living on their own.
</P>
<P>
On launching the first guidelines to help doctors to identify
and to treat heavy drinkers, Chick noted that in the past decade,
the number of UK people dying from alcohol-related diseases has
doubled while the rate has fallen in America and many European
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that a partial explanation of this seems to be that
Britain has the highest divorce rate in Europe, with a rising
proportion of people living alone.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that in Britain, up to 30 percent of male
admission and 15 percent of female admission to surgical and
medical wards are for alcohol-related diseases.

<HEADLINE> Use of More Speed Cameras Urged in UK to Reduce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- More government funding is called
for in Britain for increasing the use of speed cameras as a trial
shows that speed cameras have led to a 70 percent reduction in
fatal road accidents, said local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a trial in four west London boroughs,
which monitored the effectiveness of speed cameras, has led to a
60 million pound (100 million US dollar) saving in accident costs.
</P>
<P>
The Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety said,
"Conclusion from this trial are clear: speed cameras save lives,
not just of car occupants but also of vulnerable road users."
</P>
<P>
"This is yet another reason why the government must look again
at the funding of cameras," it added.
</P>
<P>
Figures show that the cameras have led to a 28 percent
reduction in serious accidents and an 8 percent decrease in minor
accidents.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 3,600 people were killed in Britain in road accidents
last year and a third was due to speeding, according to official
figures.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar to Charge More for Airport, Port Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar government
plans to raise airport and port service charges and introduce new
taxes on both sea tickets and luggage in an effort to boost
revenue collection.
</P>
<P>
Iddi Pandu Hassan, minister of State in the Chief-Minister's
Office for Constitution and Legal Affairs, told reporters in the
town of Zanzibar today that the plans are contained in amendments
of the budget on revenue collection to be presented to the House
of Representatives next week by Finance Minister Amina Salim Ali.
</P>
<P>
If the bill sails through, Hassan said, airport service
charges will shoot up to 2,000 Tanzania Shillings (about 3.2 U.S.
Dollars) from 1,0 T. Shs. (about 1.6 Dollars), while port
service charges up to 500 T. Shs. (about 0.8 Dollar) from 300 T.
Shs. (about 0.48 Dollar). Foreigners would pay five US Dollars as
port service charge.
</P>
<P>
The government also wants to impose a five percent sales tax
on each sea passenger ticket and luggage.
</P>
<P>
In the bill, the government further proposes that applications
by investors seeking exemptions on their investment projects set
up in Zanzibar would be charged five percent of the tax while the
remaining applications seeking exemptions would be charged two
percent of the tax.

CAIRO, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- A visiting World Bank official said here today that
the bank is to offer 15 million U.S. dollars to Jordan to help
improve the kingdom's health sector, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
The grant will be used to restructure the health sector,
improve its efficiency and upgrade the health and pharmaceutical
services in cooperation with the private sector, said Goerge
Sheeper, who was responsible for the health affairs of the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has so far lent 1.4 billion dollars to Jordan
since the early 1960s and all but 250 million dollars had been
disbursed by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Eight countries signed today a protocol on
cooperation in railway transportation, the semi-official Anatolia
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The protocol, signed by Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, Kazakhstan,
Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan in Istanbul,
the largest city of Turkey, is aimed at improving cooperation
among the concerned countries in railway transportation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Director General of Turkish
Railways (TCDD) Tekin Cinar emphasized the importance of the
Iran-Turkmenistan railway which makes the railway transportation
between Turkey and the Central Asian countries possible.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Gulf Air has sharply cut its debts to 923 million
dollars by the end of June from 1.566 billion dollars in December
1995, a statement issued by the regional carrier said today.
</P>
<P>
A further reduction is anticipated before the end of 1997, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The debts of the Bahrain-based airline jointly owned by the
governments of Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and Abu Dhabi Emirate of the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) resulted from a flurry of buying new
aircraft in the late 1980s and opening uneconomic routes.
</P>
<P>
The debt-ridden carrier has cut jobs, sold aircraft and closed
unprofitable routes to cut losses.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1996, the airline has sold six Boeing 767
aircraft and closed routes to and from New York, Geneva and
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Outlines New Plan for Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today proposed a new plan to coax teachers to the inner city and
rural communities with offers of scholarships for a three-year
commitment.
</P>
<P>
The president announced the initiative today in a speech before
the annual convention of the influential National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) at Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "Far too many schools are not serving our
children well, and too many children from our inner cities and
poor rural areas are graduating without the skills they need."
</P>
<P>
Clinton promised to send legislation to Congress next month for
the scholarships, which will put special emphasis on recruiting
minorities.
</P>
<P>
He proposed a five-year program of 350 million U.S. dollars to
subsidize the tuition of 35,000 would-be teachers who agree to
work at least three years in urban and rural schools with high
concentrations of low-income families.
</P>
<P>
The plan is among a series of education initiatives outlined by
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
As a nation, Clinton told the NAACP, "we have not given much
thought not only to how we're going to heal our own wounds and our
old challenges, but how we're going to become one America in the
21st century. We need your help."

<HEADLINE> Southern African Airlines Adopt Code of Conduct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 17 (Xinhua) -- More than 20 airlines of the
southern African countries have adopted a new code of conduct
aiming to provide for a degree of self-regulation, said an
official here today.
</P>
<P>
Airlines Association of Southern Africa Chief Executive John
Morrison said in a statement that the code of conduct would
assist various governments in its efforts to protect passengers
from financially unsound airlines and practices.
</P>
<P>
Among others, main aspects of the code include ensuring the
highest standard in dealing with the public, and assisting member
airlines in achieving adequate levels of profitability to satisfy
the association so that its members' operations are adequately
financed, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The code would also promote safe, reliable, and secure air
services, and require the provision of high quality, value for
money, industry required products and services.
</P>
<P>
South African Airways, Air Namibia, Air Malawi, Air Mauritius,
Air Zimbabwe, Lesotho Airways, and Royal Swazi National Airways
are among those which signed the code of conduct.

<HEADLINE> Housing Starts in US Up 4.8 Percent in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Housing starts in the U.S. rose
by 4.8 percent in June and all regions except for the Northeast
posted gains, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that construction of new homes and
apartments totaled 1.45 million at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate, up from a revised 1.39 million in May.
</P>
<P>
It also said the U.S. housing starts declined by 6.6 percent in
May, even sharper than the 4.8 percent drop announced last month.
</P>
<P>
Single-family starts -- 80 percent of the total -- rose by 2.6
percent to a 1.11 million rate in June, the first increase in four
months.
</P>
<P>
Construction of apartments and condominiums -- often volatile
but not as sensitive to interest-rate changes -- shot up 12.9
percent to a 342,000 rate, nearly recouping a 13.4 percent loss a
month earlier.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, starts jumped by 11.2 percent in the South. They
were up by 1.1 percent in the West and 0.7 percent in the Midwest.
But the housing starts fell 6.6 percent in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, applications for building permits -- often a
barometer of future activity -- slipped 2.6 percent to a 1.40
million annual rate, the third straight decline.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts expected new construction in the U.S. to level
off this year after reaching an eight-year high of 1.48 million in
1996. For the year so far, starts totaled 3.2 percent less than
they did during the first six months of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Freshman Lawmakers Introduce Campaign Finance Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A group of freshmen legislators
of the U.S. House of Representatives proposed today a campaign
finance bill that would ban unregulated "soft-money" donations.
</P>
<P>
The plan, endorsed by some 30 freshmen legislators, also would
require candidates for federal offices to provide more details
about their finances and more stringent disclosure for advocacy
groups advertising on TV and radio.
</P>
<P>
It would gradually increase, based on inflation, limits on
regulated campaign donations.
</P>
<P>
Representative Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, leader of the
Republican contingent on the group, admitted they have received
little support from party leaders. Leadership opposition to a ban
on soft money -- the huge, largely unregulated donations to
political parties that are supposed to be used only for
party-building activities, was "a significant discouragement for
some of the freshmen," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hutchinson said there is "an intrigue with the status quo."
</P>
<P>
On the Democratic side, Representative Ellen Tauscher of
California said working on campaign finance provides "an
opportunity to be taken to the woodshed regularly."
</P>
<P>
Although dozens of campaign finance bills have been introduced
this year, there has been little legislative action on those
bills.

<HEADLINE> US Government to Probe into UC Admissions Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. federal government has
opened probe into whether the school system's new race-blind
admissions policy discriminates against blacks and Hispanics in
three law schools of the University of California after their
sharp decline in minority enrollment this year.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to civil rights groups late last week, the
U.S. Education Department said it had "sufficient information" to
launch an investigation into admissions practices at UC's
Berkeley, Davis and Los Angeles law schools.
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at whether admissions policies discriminate,"
Education Department spokesman Rick Miller said.
</P>
<P>
The UC Berkeley announced that the number of black students
admitted to its Boalt Law School this year decreased by 81 percent
and the number of Hispanic students by 50 percent. None of the 14
black students accepted this year has chosen to attend.
</P>
<P>
The UC regents voted in 1995 to ban race, ethnicity and gender
in admissions. The policy first took effect with the graduate
school classes entering in the fall of 1997. It will apply to
undergraduates next year.

<HEADLINE> Action Plan for Tobacco Control in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 17 (Xinhua) -- An action plan for tobacco
control in Africa has been worked out at a just ended
International Workshop on Tobacco Control, local radio reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The action plan includes the adoption of comprehensive
policies including legislature by every African country to reduce
the social and economic use of tobacco for people's health.
</P>
<P>
It also calls for the provisional training for technical
assistance to increase awareness and capacity among government
ministers regarding the threat from tobacco use and from the
tobacco industry that targets African populations, especially
women and children.
</P>
<P>
According to the radio, the action plan will later be
presented for discussion and adoption by participants at the
"Africa Strategy Meeting" at the "World Conference on Smoking and
Health" billed for Beijing, China next month.
</P>
<P>
The International Workshop on Tobacco Control in Africa
started on July 13 and ended Wednesday. It was organized by the
Tobacco Control Commission of Africa.
</P>
<P>
For four days, experts drawn from nine African countries
focused their delebrations on methods of communication and
information, tobacco control and diseases prevention as priority
items on individual country's political agenda.
</P>
<P>
Africa is the only continent in the world that does not have
any tobacco control mission. It also does not have any regional
plan for action like the other continents. Therefore the action
plan drafted at this workshop has formulated practical, realistic
and attainable tobacco control objectives for Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- President Frederick Chiluba today
calls for concerted efforts in alleviating poverty in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
At a poverty alleviation seminar held here, the president
noted that with a majority of Zambians plunged in abject poverty,
the people are poorer than 10 years ago and their purchasing
power has been eroded.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 percent of the Zambian households in urban areas
live below the poverty line while 78 percent of rural dwellers
are extremely poor, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba then called for concerted efforts by all Zambians in
the fight against poverty.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty alleviation will only become a reality with joint
efforts from stake-holders in the utilization of the country's
untapped resources," the president stressed.
</P>
<P>
Zambia should not depend on the international community to
reduce its poverty because the country has the potential to
generate its own wealth, Chiluba pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said his government will soon reorganize the informal
sector so that it can create more job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba pledged his government's commitment to improving
Zambians' living standards.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Strives to Curb Child Malaria Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) is to renew its efforts in reducing deaths from malaria
among children, especially in sub-Saharan Africa where 90 percent
of the deaths are recorded annually.
</P>
<P>
"Every year, malaria causes the death of one million children
under five in Africa alone, a toll that far exceeds the mortality
rate from AIDS," reported a UNICEF statement here today.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, it said, 20 percent of children under five
in areas prone to the disease will be sleeping under a bed net
dipped in environmental-friendly insecticides, while the rate
would increases to 50 percent by 2005.
</P>
<P>
The target is to have all children in endemic areas sleeping
under a bed net by the year 2010, the statement said, adding that
the lives of 500,000 children in Africa would be saved yearly in
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF promised to strengthen the capacity of African
institutes to provide expertise in malaria control on the
continent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, control efforts are largely ignored by
industrialized countries which are less affected by the disease,
bringing about a shortage in funding for the disease, the
statement noted.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, according to UNICEF, funding for global malaria
research was only 84 million U.S. Dollars, compared to 2.3
billion Dollars on cancer research in the United States alone.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. agency said it would explore the use of vitamin A and
zinc as a way of reducing malaria morbidity, based on some
positive findings in recent research.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Approves Increased Foreign Aid Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate today approved
a foreign aid budget of 13.2 billion U.S. dollars for fiscal 1998,
one billion increase than the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The Senate approved the budget, which starts Oct. 1, on a
strong bipartisan vote of 91-8. The increase comes after a 60
percent decline in foreign aid over the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
However, the funds still amounts to less than one percent of
the federal budget. It is 116 million U.S. dollars less than
President Bill Clinton requested.
</P>
<P>
The Senate also approved by a 95-4 vote a Republican-sponsored
amendment that cuts off aid to Russia if its proposed restrictions
on religious freedom became law and to Cambodia if it does not
freely and fairly elect its government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Senate rejected a proposal by the Clinton
administration to end the annual certification process by which
countries are deemed to be fighting drugs and thus qualify for
U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, Eastern Europe and the Baltic states
were given 485 million U.S. dollars and 800 million U.S. dollars
was set out for the states of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The bill also says that there will be no U.S. aid to the
Democratic Republic of the Congo until President Laurent Kabila
cooperates with international investigation of alleged mass
killings of Hutus.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Politician Calls for Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A leading Nigerian politician today
suggested that the country's armed forces be re-organized to keep
them away from governance, the News Agency of Nigeria reported.
</P>
<P>
"Until and unless there is a serious re-organization of the
military which will encourage them to keep away from the seat of
government, I am afraid all we are doing will be in vain," said
retired Colonel Andrawus Sawa, a presidential aspirant of the
United Nigeria Congress Party.
</P>
<P>
Sawa added that unless the re-organization was undertaken, the
objectives of Vision 2010, the country's long-term economic
development blueprint, and lofty achievements recorded by the
current military administration would equally be fruitless.
</P>
<P>
The aspirant appealed to the head of state and members of the
Vision 2010 Committee to consider the methodology for the
implementation of the re-organization before October 1, 1998, the
date for installing the country's elected president.
</P>
<P>
He also blamed intermittent military incursions into politics
for the country's inability to achieve its development plans,
urging the present administration to keep its promise of hand-over
in October next year.
</P>
<P>
The military has controlled the country for most of the time
since independence was won from Britain in 1960.
</P>
<P>
The current military administration, which took power in 1993,
has promised to return power to an elected civilian government
next year.

<HEADLINE> US Senate Approves Foreign Aid Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate today
overwhelmingly approved a bill which would increase about one
billion dollars in foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which was approved with a vote of 91 to 8, covers
economic and military assistance and export assistance for U.S.
goods and services totaling 13.2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Although the Senate version of the bill is slightly below the
sum requested by the Clinton administration, it reverses a recent
trend in reducing foreign aid by adding 933 million dollars to
this year's funding level.
</P>
<P>
It provides the customary amounts of 3 billion dollars for
Israel, 2.1 billion for Egypt and 150 million for Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Although the foreign aid bill does not specify how much of the
800 million dollars provided for the former Soviet states would go
to Russia, the Clinton administration wants to give it 195 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Half of the 225 million available to the Ukraine will be
withheld pending administration certification of that nation's
efforts to end corruption.
</P>
<P>
A total of almost 1.8 billion dollars is provided for programs
to combat infectious diseases such as drug-resistant tuberculosis,
malaria, dengue fever and the ebola virus.
</P>
<P>
The House is expected to vote next week on its own measure,
which would allocate 12.3 billion dollars to foreign aid programs.
Differences between the two versions will have to be resolved in
conference before the joint bill is submitted to Clinton for his
signature.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Boost Tourism with New Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government has
announced a 360-million-U.S.-dollar fund to help boost its tourism
industry, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The Business Development Bank of Canada, wholly owned by the
federal government, will team with commercial banks to offer loans
to resorts and tourist attractions outside of major urban centers.
</P>
<P>
The goal is to attract more foreign tourists to Canada by
expanding some properties into four-season locations and
increasing the size of others to accommodate more people during
high season.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Tourism Commission will help assess the viability
of the projects and ensure that operators are building facilities
that travelers will want to visit.
</P>
<P>
According to Canadian Industry Minister John Manley, Canada has
moved to 10th place in terms of worldwide tourism revenues, up
three places from earlier this decade
</P>
<P>
The country's tourism industry revenue is expected to rise a
further 1.5 billion to 32 billion in 1997, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> IDB Approves Financing for Land Titling Modernization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) today announced the approval of a 38.5 million U.S.
dollar loan to Colombia in a support for a program to modernize
land titling and the registry of deeds and cadastre.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to consolidate and strengthen an open,
transparent, and efficient land market that will make access to
the financial system easier for urban and rural property owners.
</P>
<P>
Registered titles will be awarded for some 100,000 parcels of
land in 200 rural municipalities and 150,000 parcels of urban
property in 50 municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The systems of more than 100 recording offices and 15 district
cadastres will be computerized.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is some 104 million dollars. In
addition to the IDB loan, local counterpart will fund some 65.5
million dollars.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Deaths Continue to Decline in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 17 (Xinhua) -- While AIDS deaths are on the
increase worldwide, AIDS deaths continue to decline in the Unites
States, and the trend is expected to go on, according to a latest
report of the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
The number of deaths dropped 19 percent, to 30,700 from 37,900,
in the first nine months of 1996, compared with the same period of
1995. Among women, the number of deaths dropped for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
"We have entered a new era in the H.I.V. epidemic, both in
terms of treatment and prevention," said Helene Gayle, who heads
the AIDS programs of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, in Atlanta, a southern city of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The overall decline was attributed to greater access to medical
care and to development of newer drug therapies for both the AIDS
virus and infections that can occur as fatal complications of
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
But disproportionate rates of decline in AIDS deaths among men,
women and minority groups are worrisome to AIDS experts. Death of
women decreased by 7 percent, compared with the 22 percent decline
in deaths among men. While the number of deaths dropped 28 percent
for whites, the drop was 10 percent for blacks and 16 percent for
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
The Centers for Disease Control estimates that there are from
600,000 to 900,000 infected people in the United States.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Backs Expanding U.N. Security Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States today said
that it would support the permanent U.N. Security Council members
increased to ten, including three more seats for three developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters that
the U.S. agrees that there ought to be "developing countries sit
on a permanent basis on the U.N. Security Council as permanent
members."
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the regions themselves -- the African
countries, the Latin American countries and the Asian countries --
ought to decide how these seats will be filled," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has long backed Germany and Japan as permanent members
of the UN Security Council, but has not indicated which developing
countries it favors.
</P>
<P>
Burns added that the U.S. has not taken a position on the veto
power for new permanent members including Germany and Japan.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the U.S. will "oppose any resolution which
infringes on prerogatives for current permanent members."
</P>
<P>
"We believe that this should be worked out and discussed,
specifically -- obviously, on the U.N. Security Council, " he
said, adding that the U.S. would favor the size of the Security
Council increased to 20 or 21 members.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the regions themselves, the African countries,
the Latin countries and the Asian countries, ought to decide how
these seats will be filled," he said.
</P>
<P>
Burns said he expected the issue to be "very actively"
discussed throughout the next year.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Bank Urges Ottawa to Lift Ban on Mergers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Canada's third largest bank, the
Bank of Montreal, has called for virtually all-out competition in
financial services, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Under its proposals, Canada's domestic banks could merge,
foreign banks could buy into Canadian ones and the doors to
retailing insurance and asset leasing would be open wide.
</P>
<P>
"Canadian banks should not be prohibited from merging to meet
competition and therefore continue to provide their customers with
financial services at internationally competitive prices," said
Tim O'Neill, chief economist of the bank.
</P>
<P>
O'Neill made the remarks at a news conference where Bank of
Montreal unveiled its submission to a federal task force that is
examining the future of financial services in Canada.
</P>
<P>
The bank's proposals include asking that foreign banks be
allowed to increase their stakes in Canadian banks under certain
condition.
</P>
<P>
Currently, ownership in Canada's big banks by any single
interest is limited to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, it proposed allowing mergers of Canadian
banks, to make them more competitive internationally and at home.
</P>
<P>
It also suggested opening up access to the Canadian payments
system to non-banks, insurers and retailers, for example, which
would then be able to issue checks and/or debit cards.
</P>
<P>
As well, it recommended loosening restrictions on selling
insurance and asset leasing.
</P>
<P>
As it now stands, Canadian banks are not allowed to sell
insurance in their branches and are confined to selling only
certain kinds of leases.

<HEADLINE> Togolese President to Mediate on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Togolese Foreign
Minister Koffi Panou reaffirmed here today that President
Gnassingbe Eyadema has promised to mediate on the Bakassi
conflict between Nigeria and Cameroun.
</P>
<P>
Panou made the statement to the press here this afternoon
after a brief meeting with Camerounian Prime Minister Peter
Mafany Musonge.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Cameroun have fought fiercely on several occasions
over the oil-rich Bakassi peninsula in the Gulf of Guinea and
later put the issue to the International Court in Hague for
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
Panou said his current visit was also designed to strengthen
the fraternal relations existing between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Togolese Foreign Minister also had discussions with the
Camerounian Premier on global issues, particularly some hot spots
on the African continent, Panou added.
</P>
<P>
As special envoy for Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema,
Panou also forwarded an undisclosed message from President
Eyadema to Camerounian President Paul Biya during the visit.
</P>
<P>
The envoy also stressed the need for African leaders to meet
regularly in order to resolve their differences through peaceful
means.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Send Troops to Train Africans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Approximately 120 U.S. special
forces troops are preparing to go to Senegal and Uganda on July 21
to begin a U.S.-sponsored program of training African troops for
peacekeeping and humanitarian missions, the State Department said
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"This initiative is compatible with the call at the Denver
summit for long term efforts to promote rapidly deployable African
peacekeeping capabilities," spokesman Nicholas Burns told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
At the Denver summit last month, several countries called for
long-range moves to develop such peacekeeping units so that the
United States and other non-African countries could minimize the
need to intervene in crises under the auspices of the United
Nations of the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to work closely with France and the United
Kingdom, as well as many African countries to move towards the
establishment of an African peacekeeping support group," Burns
said. The U.S. special forces troops will train battalion-size
units in the two countries and Burns said training in other
nations will start shortly.
</P>
<P>
The other nations include Ethiopia, Mali, Malawi, Ghana and
Tunisia, according to reports.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Retreat Modestly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street fell
modestly today in heavy trading as investors netted some profits
from Wednesday's rally, which put the Dow Jones industrial average
above 8,000 for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The Dow fell by 18.11 to 8,020.77.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-8 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume totaling 629.06
million shares, down from 646.03 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 5.01 to 931.58, and
the NYSE composite index fell 2.28 to 482.96.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 11.65 to 1,568.98, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.69 at 637.34.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market indicators also pulled back slightly as interest
rates moved higher from Wednesday's seven-month low in the bond
market.
</P>
<P>
The market was not very much moved by the news of more company
gains. But investors are waiting for the results of Microsoft
which will be released after the closing bell.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, technology shares led a broad rally spurred by a
mixture of more good news on company profits, inflation and
interest rates. The Dow gained 63 points, breaking above the
8,000-barrier less than 2 years and 4 months after it first
crossed 4,000.
</P>
<P>
There was little reaction to today's economic news, which
included a 4.8 percent increase of June's housing starts and a
drop in first claims of jobless benefits last week.
