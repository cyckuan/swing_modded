	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Roman Catholics and Protestants
alike buried 16 bombing victims, while the Irish government vowed
to strengthen its anti-terrorist laws to prevent follow-up attacks
to Northern Ireland's deadliest attack.
	   Columns of grief-stricken residents followed hearses that snaked
slowly through the bomb-ravaged center of Omagh Wednesday. More
funerals for victims of political violence were held Wednesday than
in any other single day during Northern Ireland's three decades of
sectarian violence.
	   The final eight victims were to be buried Thursday.
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern announced plans to close down
the Irish Republican Army dissidents who planted Saturday's car
bomb that killed 28 people and wounded 220.
	   Ahern said he considered his government's initiatives
``extremely draconian'' but added he was not prepared to risk more
attacks by dissidents of the Real IRA splinter group, which
admitted responsibility for the carbombing.
	   The group refuses to adhere to the IRA's July 1997 truce and
announced Wednesday only that it had ``suspended'' its bombing
campaign in light of the Omagh carnage, which it called
unintentional.
	   The proposals approved by an emergency session of Ahern's
Cabinet _ most of which already are in place north of the Irish
border _ included restricting the right to bail for suspected
terrorists, allowing judges to infer guilt if a suspect refuses to
answer questions, and extending the allowable time to hold suspects
without charge from 48 hours to 96 hours.
	   People also could be convicted of belonging to outlawed groups
if a senior detective testifies they are members.
	   Ahern said the measures would become law within two weeks to
defend both Northern Ireland's peace agreement ``and the people of
both parts of this island from attack by groups who have no
legitimacy whatsoever.''
	   With controlled anger, he noted his visit Tuesday to the Irish
Republic town of Buncrana, where three bomb victims ranging from 8
to 12 were buried Wednesday.
	   ``When you stand ... in a room with the body of a young boy, a
beautiful young boy, who should be out playing football on what was
a fine day, who should be looking forward to seeing his boyhood
dreams come true ... it brings home to you what you're dealing
with,'' Ahern said.
	   Seeking to head off a crackdown, the dissidents _ who began
planting car bombs in Northern Ireland towns in February hoping to
thwart the Belfast peace talks _ said they suspended ``all military
operations'' pending internal debate on future strategy.
	   Bernadette Sands-McKevitt, the common-law wife of Michael
McKevitt, the reputed leader of the Real IRA, told Irish radio that
she was pleased with the group's announcement.
	   ``I have already condemned it and we could not condone it,'' she
said of the Omagh attack, which she added had nothing to do with
her or McKevitt.
	   Local reports said the couple had moved from their home in the
Irish Republic border town of Dundalk for fear of attacks. Several
hundred people rallied in the town after dark Wednesday in support
of the Omagh victims and against McKevitt, although they cancelled
plans to march to his home.
	   Politicians on both sides heaped scorn on the Real IRA
statement.
	   ``It's too late for those who were massacred,'' said Pat
Doherty, vice president of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party.
	   And Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble, the Protestant
who was named first minister of Northern Ireland's new
cross-community government, called the statement contemptible and
untrustworthy.
	   On Wednesday, soldiers erected a steel wall at the Market Street
crossroads where the 500-pound (227-kilo) car bomb detonated. That
blocked the destruction from the view of the mile-long (1.6
kilometer-long) funeral processions which passed silently through
the town from churches to cemeteries.
	   Those businesses not damaged by the bomb closed for the day,
pinning messages and floral tributes to their front doors.
	   Medical staff at the local hospital for the first time offered
harrowing accounts Wednesday of how they battled in the first
hellish hours of the attack last Saturday, when they were
overwhelmed with more than 200 wounded.
	   Administrators of the town's County Tyrone Hospital confirmed
Wednesday that the casualty toll from the attack by an IRA
dissident gang actually topped 330, a figure lost in the frenetic
scramble to ship wounded by ambulance and helicopter to other
Northern Ireland hospitals.
	   ``Nothing could have prepared me for what I saw,'' said Thomas
McFarland, a mental health nurse pressed into emergency service.
	   ``You could not really be trained for what you had seen unless
you were trained in Vietnam or somewhere like that,'' he said.
	   And at every funeral, pews filled to overflowing. Hundreds stood
outside in the rain as entire communities _ Protestant and Catholic
alike _ rallied behind the families.
	   ``In our terrible experience of the last 30 years, Omagh was the
worst atrocity of them all,'' said retired Catholic Bishop Edward
Daly. ``Is it too much to ask or too much to hope that it will be
the last atrocity of all?'' he asked at the Requiem Mass for
21-month-old Breda Devine.

Thai army chief firm on entering politics: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's army chief still plans to
run for political office after retiring later this year despite a
recent poll that shows Thais don't want the army involved in
politics, a local report said Thursday.
	   Gen. Chetta Thanajaro dismissed the poll results, saying only
about 5,000 Thais had been surveyed so that it was not
representative of the country's feelings as a whole, The Nation
newspaper reported Thursday.
	   He also reiterated his intention to run for a seat in parliament
following his retirement later this year, the paper said.
	   Neither the general nor his aides could be reached for comment
on the report.
	   The poll was conducted by a local institute from August 14 to
Aug. 18 and questioned 5,679 people. It found that 42.9 percent of
the respondents were strongly opposed to the army becoming involved
in politics. No margin of error was given.
	   Thailand's army has been a strong political force since a clique
of colonels overthrew the country's former absolute monarchy in
1932. More than a dozen coup d'etats have taken place since the end
of World War II.
	   The last coup d'etat took place in 1991. A democracy uprising
helped end military rule in 1992.
	   Even when not directly running the country, the army's shadow
has loomed a large over the political landscape. However, Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai has instituted several reforms to bring the
armed forces under civilian control.
	   Chuan's predecessor, Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, was a
former army chief. He was driven from office by widespread street
protests against his inept handling of Thailand's economic crisis.

Canada's high court delivers crucial ruling on Quebec's right to
</HEADLINE>
secede &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Will be topped after ruling issued at about 1345 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Until now, it was a crucial question without an
official answer: does Quebec have the right to secede from Canada
without the consent of the federal government?
	   On Thursday, in perhaps its most important ruling ever, the
Supreme Court of Canada will give an answer. Whatever the nine
justices say, their opinion is likely to embolden Quebec's
separatist government as it maneuvers to hold another referendum on
independence for the mostly French-speaking province.
	   The federal government, alarmed by the separatists' near-victory
in a 1995 referendum, turned to the Supreme Court in hopes of
convincing wavering Quebec voters that secession would not be quick
and painless.
	   The justice minister asked the court to rule on three questions.
Can Quebec legally declare unilateral independence under Canadian
law? Can it secede under international law? If there is a conflict,
which law prevails?
	   The federal government argued before the court that Quebec could
secede only after negotiations with federal authorities and the
other nine provinces. The Quebec government refused to participate
in the proceedings, although the judges appointed a separatist
lawyer to argue that side of the case.
	   Quebec's separatist premier, Lucien Bouchard, is in a strong
position politically. If the court surprises legal analysts by
ruling that Quebec does have a right to secede unilaterally,
Bouchard can claim victory. If it rules otherwise, as expected, he
can run an election campaign in the next few months claiming that
Quebeckers' right to decide their own destiny is under siege.
	   ``There is solid public opinion in Quebec that it's not up to
the Supreme Court to decide or limit in any way the right of the
Quebec people to choose their future,'' he said last week.
	   Bouchard was the separatists' charismatic campaign chief for the
1995 referendum, when they received 49.4 percent of the votes. He
became premier in early 1996 and had been an overwhelming favorite
for re-election until one of Canada's most popular politicians,
Jean Charest, left Parliament earlier this year to become leader of
Quebec's anti-separatist Liberal Party.
	   The latest polls show Charest's initial edge over Bouchard to be
shrinking, and the next provincial election _ either late this year
or next spring _ is expected to be quite close.
	   If Bouchard wins, he has pledged to call another referendum on
secession, though he has been vague about the timing.
	   Charest predicted Bouchard would try to provoke a pro-separatist
backlash no matter how the Supreme Court ruled.
	   ``I'm convinced Bouchard's Parti Quebecois will denounce this
judgment as humiliating and degrading for Quebeckers,'' Charest
said. ``The meaning of the words will be exaggerated and
distorted.''

Reserve Bank eases monetary restrictions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) - The Reserve Bank loosened
monetary restrictions Thursday, halving its growth projections for
the economy for the rest of 1998 and warning that the global
economy remained fragile.
	   After approving lower interest rates by banks and looser credit
restrictions, Reserve Bank Governor Don Brash said picking the
direction of the economy over the coming year is a `tricky call''
given global uncertainty.
	   If major economies like the United States begin to slow, the
world economy will lose its buffer against the slowdown in Asia and
other emerging economies, Brash said.
	   ``A major world recession is possible,'' he told reporters.
	   Money markets reacted immediately, with the New Zealand dollar
falling more than 1/2 cent against the U.S. dollar, while interest
rates for key government stocks and home mortgages fell, and the
stock market rebounded a solid 3 percent.
	   The bank is forecasting annual average GDP growth of 0.1 percent
for the New Zealand economy next year, 4 percent in 2000 and 4.7
percent in 2001.
	   Brash said the economy was probably in a mild recession in the
first half of the year, with a GDP fall in the March quarter almost
certainly followed by a further fall in the June quarter.

Report: British woman murdered in eastern Malaysia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A 42-year-old British woman was
found murdered on her 21st wedding anniversary in her house in the
eastern state of Sabah, a newspaper said Thursday.
	   Neighbors on Wednesday morning found Brenda Elizabeth Breadman
of Cambridge, England, lying in a pool of blood with a stab wound
in the neck The Star newspaper reported.
	   The Briton, who was a teacher at a local college, was believed
to have been clobbered with a stick and then stabbed with a knife
between Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, the daily quoted
police in Sabah as saying.
	   Police have not established the motive for the murder.
	   Breadman had been living in Sabah since 1977 when she married
Rasalah Abdul Hala and moved to Malaysia. She converted to Islam
and changed her name to Rosliah binti Abdullah.
	   Both her husband and her 19-year-old daughter were out of town
when the killing occurred.
	   Rasalah, who was in Kuala Lumpur, said he felt something was
amiss when his wife did not answer his calls on Tuesday night and
Wednesday morning.
	   When they last spoke Tuesday afternoon, she had asked him about
her citizenship application and had told him that she had a belated
birthday present for him, Rasalah was quoted as saying by The Star.
	   The daughter, Suzanne, last saw her mother on Tuesday night
before she left for Tenom city, south of Kota Kinabalu, the capital
of Sabah, where the family stays.
	   An official of the British High Commission in Kuala Lumpur did
not give any details but said inquiries were being made about the
killing.

On post-Cold War stage, Castro plays elderly Caribbean statesman
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; With Dominican-Guarding Castro &QL; 
 &UR; By JAMES ANDERSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Half a century ago,
Fidel Castro tried to reach the Dominican Republic in a boat filled
with armed revolutionaries intent on ousting the military dictator
in Santo Domingo.
	   On Thursday, Castro arrives on his first trip to the Dominican
Republic since becoming Cuba's leader in 1959.
	   Playing elder statesman on a smaller stage than he sought during
the Cold War, Castro is championing the neglected causes of his
Caribbean neighbors at a 16-nation summit this week.
	   Coming off a triumphant Caribbean tour in which he railed
against the dangers unbridled capitalism poses to small island
states, Castro will get a warm reception. Shunning Washington's
isolation of the 72-year-old Castro, the Caribbean Community trade
bloc and the Dominican Republic say it's time to bring communist
Cuba back into the fold.
	   Many of the area's countries have recently renewed trade and
diplomatic ties with Cuba _ most recently the Dominican Republic,
which restored full relations in April after a 34-year lapse.
	   They want Cuba to help them bargain for aid and trade incentives
for their banana and sugar exports to the European Union.
	   Anti-Castro Cuban exiles in the United States are using the
occasion to condemn his human rights record _ and Caribbean
democracies for embracing him.
	   ``Once again we are raising our voice to repudiate the attitude
of democratic governments for inviting a dictator,'' declared the
Casa Jose Marti, a Puerto Rico-based exile group that said its
members would go protest in Santo Domingo, 70 miles (110
kilometers) away.
	   The exiles also were seeking permission from the Dominican
government to fly an airplane over Santo Domingo with a banner
reading ``Fidel Castro: dictator and murderer.''
	   Julio Labatut, director of the exile group, and other exile
leaders met with the Dominican consul in Puerto Rico, Julio Cesar
Santana, on Wednesday to request permission for the banner flight.
Santana promised an answer on Thursday.
	   Labatut said the exiles intend no harm.
	   ``If someone were going to make an attempt on Castro's life,
they'd just do it, they wouldn't ask permission,'' he said.
	   Sergio Ramos, another Puerto Rico-based Cuban exile, accused the
Dominican and Cuban governments of fomenting a scare to depict
``every Cuban opposed to Castro's tyranny as a terrorist.''
	   Officials of the Caribbean Community, a dlrs 18 billion market,
hope to gently press Castro Friday and Saturday to enact political
reforms. The summit, said spokesman Leonard Robertson, follows
``our policy of dialogue and constructive engagement with Cuba.''
	   Castro is expected to steal the show during a five-day trip that
will also take him to northwestern Monte Cristi, where Cuban
patriot Jose Marti and Dominican Gen. Maximo Gomez signed an 1895
pact to seek Cuba's independence from Spain.
	   Dominican President Leonel Fernandez, who has worked closely
with Washington on trade, drug trafficking and money laundering,
has criticized the U.S. embargo of Cuba.
	   Fernandez's political party has long ties to Cuba; its founder,
former Dominican President Juan Bosch, was once exiled there and
led the failed 1947 expedition in which Castro took part. The boat
was stopped and the dissidents disbanded before they left Cuban
waters.
	   Caribbean nations once wary of Castro's revolutionary designs
now feel safe embracing him _ especially at a time when Washington
has slashed aid to the region.
	   Nowhere is the rapprochement more apparent than in the Dominican
Republic, which lies just 160 miles (250 kilometers) southeast of
Cuba and shares strong cultural and historical ties.
	   Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista fled to the Dominican Republic
after his ouster by Castro on Jan. 1, 1959. In June 1959, Castro
sponsored a small invasion against then-Dominican dictator Rafael
Trujillo, whose military annihilated the force of some 200
Dominican exiles and a few Cubans. Two months later, Trujillo
backed Cuban exiles in a frustrated attempt to overthrow Castro.

Amid threats, Dominicans mount unprecedented security for Castro
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Dominican-Castro &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSE MONEGRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ In an unprecedented
security campaign, the Dominican Republic was preparing to protect
Cuban leader Fidel Castro against reported assassination attempts
during a five-day visit starting Thursday.
	   Some 2,300 security agents, including 300 Cubans, have deployed
to safeguard Castro, a man reviled by many of his countrymen who
fled Cuba after he installed a Communist dictatorship there in
1959. Bomb-sniffing dogs arrived from Havana Friday.
	   Over the past month, Castro's travels in the region _ to
Jamaica, Barbados and Grenada _ have exposed him more than usual to
possible attack.
	   Santo Domingo's Las Americas international airport will close
from 8:30 a.m. (12:30 GMT) until the Cuban leader arrives around 11
a.m (1500 GMT), said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Nani Martinez. It
was not clear what would happen with scheduled flights.
	   Castro, who is to attend a summit with 15 other Caribbean
leaders, will make his first visit to the Dominican Republic since
he took power almost four decades ago. Earlier this year, the two
countries renewed diplomatic ties severed 34 years ago.
	   Gen. Sigfrido Pared, chief of the Directorate of National
Investigations, said they were being especially watchful of Cuban
exiles from Miami who have arrived in recent weeks.
	   ``We have not stopped anyone from entering the country, but we
are being vigilant,'' said immigration director Danilo Diaz.
	   Last week, Dominican police said they had arrested a Cuban exile
carrying a Spanish passport in connection with an alleged plot to
assassinate Castro.
	   The Miami Herald reported that the FBI had been informed of a
plot involving exiled militant Luis Posada Carriles, who has
claimed responsibility for recent bombings in Havana. The FBI's
informant promised to take them to a warehouse where arms and
explosives were stored, but nothing was found there.
	   The U.S. Embassy, meanwhile, warned in July of a reported plot
to bomb an airliner serving Santo Domingo and Havana.
	   In Santo Domingo, a metal detector was set up at the Jaragua
Hotel, where most of the leaders are staying. It was not clear if
Castro would stay there too.
	   Outside the hotel, a sharpshooter in camouflage uniform
patrolled. Others were on alert within a couple of blocks of the
hotel.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A 42-year-old British woman was
found dead in a pool of blood on her 21st wedding anniversary at
her home in the eastern state of Sabah, a newspaper said Thursday.
	   Neighbors on Wednesday morning found Brenda Elizabeth Breadman
of Cambridge, England, with a stab wound in the neck, The Star
newspaper reported.
	   The Briton, who was a teacher at a local college, was believed
to have been clobbered with a stick and then stabbed with a knife
between Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, the daily quoted
police in Sabah as saying.
	   Police have not established the motive for the alleged killing.
	   Breadman had been living in Sabah since 1977 when she married
Rasalah Abdul Hala and moved to Malaysia. She converted to Islam
and changed her name to Rosliah binti Abdullah.
	   Both her husband and her 19-year-old daughter were out of town
when the alleged killing occurred.
	   Rasalah, who was in Kuala Lumpur, said he felt something was
amiss when his wife did not answer his calls on Tuesday night and
Wednesday morning.
	   When they last spoke Tuesday afternoon, she had asked him about
her citizenship application and had told him that she had a belated
birthday present for him, Rasalah was quoted as saying by The Star.
	   The daughter, Suzanne, last saw her mother on Tuesday night
before she left for Tenom city, south of Kota Kinabalu, the capital
of Sabah, where the family lives.
	   An official of the British High Commission in Kuala Lumpur did
not give any details but said inquiries were being made about the
death.

Nicaragua continues to battle former soldiers and rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Police reported killing 17 former
Contra rebels and ex-soldiers _ members of armed criminal gangs in
northern Nicaragua _ over the last seven months.
	   The scene of the battles was the same as it was in Nicaragua's
Contra war of the 1980s. After the war ended, many former
combatants from both sides joined gangs, which are now accused of
robberies and killings.
	   The National Police did not report on government casualties in
the operation, which defeated 108 such gangs and filed criminal
charges against 408 gang members. About 36 other gangs remain
active, police said.
	   In the 1980s, the U.S.-backed Contra rebels fought to overthrow
the leftist Sandinista government.

Aboriginal to launch Australian leg of torch relay
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Aboriginal Nova Peris-Kneebone will be
the first Australian to carry the Olympic torch when it arrives in
June 2000 for the Sydney Olympics.
	   Peris-Kneebone, 27, is Australia's only Aboriginal gold medal
winner at an Olympics, having played in the women's field hockey
victory in Atlanta. She quit the sport after the games and began a
track and field career as a sprinter.
	   ``I'm thrilled. It's an honor which is going to be unbelievable
for me,'' said Peris-Kneebone, who hopes to qualify for the
Olympics as a competitor.
	   Olympics Minister and president of the Sydney Organizing
Committee, Michael Knight, said the SOCOG board was intent on
choosing a female, Aboriginal Olympian to launch the torch relay.
	   The Olympic torch will be carried through Australia for 100 days
before the lighting of the flame in the Olympic Stadium on Sept.
15, 2000.

Athletics rout White Sox
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS to update with late games. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OAKLAND, California (AP) _ Rookie Blake Stein threw a two-hitter
for his first major league shutout and the Athletics continued
their home run barrage as Oakland defeated the Chicago White Sox
6-0 Wednesday.
	   Stein, obtained in last summer's deal that sent Mark McGwire to
St. Louis, allowed only a bunt single by Mike Caruso in the first
and a bloop triple by Magglio Ordonez in the second.
	   The triple fell between second baseman Scott Spiezio and right
fielder Jason McDonald, who accidentally was kneed in the face by
Spiezio as both tumbled.
	   McDonald, who spent more than two months on the disabled list
earlier this season with a concussion after an outfield collision
with teammate Rickey Henderson, momentarily appeared stunned but
stayed in the game.
	   Stein (5-7) struck out three and walked five in his 18th major
league start.
 &UR; Orioles 6, Devil Rays 4
	   In Baltimore, Mike Bordick hit a three-run homer and Mike
Mussina struck out 10 in seven gritty innings.
	   The Orioles' sixth win in seven games improved their record to
30-8 since the All-Star break. Cal Ripken went 3-for-4 with an RBI
to move within one hit of tying Brooks Robinson's franchise record
of 2,848 career hits.
	   Mussina (12-6) threw 120 pitches, allowing two runs on nine hits
and a walk. The right-hander struck out Randy Winn and Kevin
Stocker three times each in recording at least 10 strikeouts for
the fifth time this season.
	   Rookie Rolando Arrojo (11-10) gave up four runs and nine hits in
5 2-3 innings and fell to 0-4 in six starts since July 16.
 &UR; Red Sox 11, Royals 1
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Mike Stanley homered twice and drove
in six runs and Tim Wakefield pitched his second complete game of
the season in the victory.
	   Stanley, acquired from Toronto on July 30, hit a two-run homer
in the Boston's four-run first inning and added a two-run single in
the four-run second.
	   Wakefield (15-5) pitched a five-hitter, with five walks and no
strikeouts. His previous career best was a three-hitter, against
Oakland on June 9, 1995.
	   Brian Barber (0-1), one day after being called up from Triple-A
Omaha, lasted just 1 2-3 innings in his Royals debut. The
right-hander, who was 2-1 with St. Louis in 1995, gave up seven
hits and eight runs, walked three and struck out none.
 &UR; Twins 5, Yankees 3
	   In Minneapolis, the Minnesota Twins made it 3-for-3 against Andy
Pettitte this season, getting outstanding relief performances from
Dan Serafini and Mike Trombley.
	   Five different players drove in runs for the Twins, who won for
just the third time in August and handed the Yankees their second
loss in 14 games.
	   The Twins, whose three wins against the Yankees equal the most
by any team this season, prevented New York from the best record
this century through 123 games. The Yankees are 92-31, matching the
1906 Chicago Cubs' 123-game mark.
	   Pettitte (14-7) gave up all five runs on nine hits in eight
innings for his fifth complete game of the season. He is 0-3
against Minnesota this season with an 8.27 ERA.
	   Serafini (6-4) lost his spot in the starting rotation Wednesday
when Mike Morgan returned from the disabled list, but allowed three
hits and one run over 3 2-3 innings in relief of Morgan.
 &UR; Rangers 3, Indians 1
	   In Arlington, Texas, Charles Nagy gave up the lead with two
straight bases-loaded walks during the Rangers' three-run sixth
inning as Texas snapped a three-game losing streak.
	   Nagy (10-9) walked Todd Zeile and Mike Simms for the second and
third runs of the inning after Ivan Rodriguez's infield single tied
it at 1.
	   Aaron Sele (14-10) allowed one run and five hits in eight
innings for only his second victory since July 4. Sele, who struck
out three and walked one, won only one of his previous seven
starts. The 14 wins is a career-high for Sele who won 13 games in
1997 for Boston.
 &UR; Angels 2, Tigers 0
	   In Anaheim, California, Jack McDowell, back after missing 2 1/2
months with a sore elbow, pitched seven strong innings to win for
only the second time since May 7, 1997.
	   McDowell (2-2) threw 80 pitches, 59 for strikes, struck out two,
allowed five hits and walked none.
	   McDowell, on the DL twice this year because of his ailing elbow,
rejoined the active roster last Saturday but had to finally serve a
four-day suspension for participating in the Angels-Royals brawl in
Kansas City on June 2.
	   Darin Erstad, also just off the disabled list, put Anaheim ahead
to stay with an RBI single in the third inning. Reggie Williams
made it 2-0 in the fifth with an RBI single.
	   McDowell outdueled the Tigers' Justin Thompson, who gave up two
runs on nine hits. Thompson (10-10) struck out five and walked
two.

Report: Japan missile plan on hold before Jiang's visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan will put on hold funding for a proposed
theater missile defense program with the United States until after
a visit next month by China's president, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   The Asahi daily said the Defense Agency will not make a budget
request for the plan, normally due by the end of this month, until
after President Jiang Zemin returns home.
	   The Asahi, quoting government sources it did not identify, said
the agency will not solicit the funds for fear of harming bilateral
ties in advance of the visit.
	   Jiang's visit, from Sept. 6-11, will be the first ever to Japan
by a Chinese president.
	   The TMD system is designed to destroy incoming missiles in the
sky before they reach their targets.
	   Japan views the program as crucial for regional defense, due to
what it sees as nuclear threats from North Korea, India and
Pakistan.
	   A Defense Agency spokesman refused to verify the Asahi report,
saying there was ``no official comment available at this time.'' He
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Beijing has criticized the joint Japan-U.S. project, saying it
would stimulate other countries to spend more on their own defense,
the report said.
	   Japan is China's biggest trading partner and a major source of
investment and development aid. But their relationship is still
haunted by memories of Japan's brutal 1931-1945 occupation.
	   The Defense Agency has earmarked a total of 557 million yen
(dlrs 3.87 million) for basic research on the project from fiscal
1995 through 1998, the Asahi said.
	   It was planning to request about 1 billion yen (dlrs 6.94
million) as additional research spending for next fiscal year
beginning April 1, 1999, the report said.
	   The agency will instead request a budget for the research at the
end of the year before the government starts compiling its state
budget for next fiscal year, the Asahi quoted government sources as
saying.

Cardinals top Cubs as McGwire hits pair
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS with late games &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ After going more than a week without a home run,
Mark McGwire hit Nos. 48 and 49 back-to-back Wednesday to give the
Cardinals an 8-6 victory over the Cubs in 10 innings.
	   Sosa hit his 48th homer in the fifth inning.
	   It was the 49th multi-homer game of McGwire's career, and his
sixth this season.
	   After tying the game at 6 in the eighth, McGwire homered to
center field in the 10th. Ray Lankford, batting after McGwire, hit
a solo home run to make it 8-6.
	   The Cubs blew a chance to win it in the bottom of the inning.
With two outs, Mark Grace singled, then moved to third on Henry
Rodriguez's double. Juan Acevedo intentionally walked Jose
Hernandez to load the bases, but Manny Alexander popped up to
McGwire to end the game.
	   Acevedo (6-2) gave up two hits and one intentional walk in two
innings. Terry Mulholland (3-4) gave up three hits and two runs _
both homers _ in 2 1-3 innings. He walked one and struck out three.
 &UR; Reds 8, Brewers 2
	   In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Pete Harnisch allowed five hits in 7
2-3 innings and Sean Casey had a homer and an RBI double as the
Cincinnati Reds beat the Brewers.
	   Harnisch (9-6) took a shutout into the eighth before allowing a
two-run homer to Fernando Vina. He struck out five and walked four.
	   Casey staked Cincinnati to a 1-0 lead in the first with his
third home run, a 425-shot over the Brewers' bullpen in right field
off Steve Woodard (9-8).
	   The Reds added six runs in the fourth on seven hits to knock out
Woodard and take a 7-0 lead. Barry Larkin opened the inning with a
single. One out later, Jeffrey Hammonds, Eddie Taubensee, Bret
Boone and Chris Stynes followed with successive singles to make it
5-0.
	   Reggie Sanders two-out RBI single made it 6-0, chasing Woodard.
Casey greeted reliever Bronswell Patrick with an RBI double.
 &UR; Expos 8, Diamondbacks 2
	   In Phoenix, Dustin Hermanson, who already had a two-hitter
against Arizona this year, gave up three hits in seven innings as
Felipe Alou broke the record for most wins by a Montreal manager
with 521, one more than Buck Rodgers.
	   After losing seven straight, the Expos won the last two on their
nine-game road trip.
	   Vladimir Guerrero had three RBIs, two of them with his 30th home
run of the season. Chris Widger drove in three with a bases-loaded
double.
	   Bernard Gilkey and Matt Williams hit solo homers for Arizona and
the only other hit given up by Hermanson (11-9) was Karim Garcia's
two-out single in the fifth.
	   Amaury Telemaco (4-8) allowed four runs, three earned, on six
hits in the loss.
 &UR; Marlins 6, Padres 0
	   In Miami, Brian Meadows pitched seven shutout innings as Florida
snapped its five-game losing streak.
	   With Tony Gwynn and Ken Caminiti out with injuries, the Padres
could only manage nine singles off Meadows (10-9) and two more
against Vic Darensbourg and Brian Edmondson.
	   Meadows, who was 0-3 with an 11.68 ERA in his last three starts,
walked none and struck out two.
	   Mike Redmond's single ignited Florida's four-run fifth inning
and his second major league homer in the sixth off Sterling
Hitchcock (7-5) extended the Marlins' lead to 6-0.
	   Hitchcock allowed nine hits, one walk and struck out four.
 &UR; Pirates 6, Dodgers 5
	   In Pittsburgh, Manny Martinez homered and drove in three runs
and the Pittsburgh Pirates rallied to beat Los Angeles _ the
Dodgers' 10th loss in 14 games.
	   With interim general manager Tommy Lasorda watching on, the
Dodgers (62-64) squandered leads of 3-0 and 5-4 to slip two games
under .500 for the first time since they were 40-42 on June 30.
	   The Pirates, long since banished from the NL Central race, have
won three straight and seven of nine. They won only six of their
last 16 from the Dodgers before sweeping the two-game series, their
first series victory over Los Angeles since June 1996.
	   Mike Williams (3-1) got the win with two scoreless relief
innings before Jason Christiansen, who signed a dlrs 1.725 million
contract extension Tuesday, pitched a perfect ninth for his fifth
save.
	   Brian Bohanon (6-8) took the loss _ only his second in his last
six starts _ even though only three of the Pirates' six runs
against him were earned.
 &UR; Astros 4, Phillies 3
	   In Philadelphia, Derek Bell's two-run single with two outs in
the ninth rallied Houston to a victory.
	   The Phillies led 3-2 heading into the ninth, but with one out,
pinch-hitters Dave Clark and Richard Hidalgo singled off reliever
Mark Leiter to put runners on first and third. Craig Biggio flied
out to right and Clark held up on Bobby Abreu's throw home, which
was up the third-base line.
	   Leiter (6-4) hit Bill Spiers on the left elbow to load the bases
and Bell then lined a fastball to center for the game-winner.
	   Shane Reynolds (15-8) gave up five hits, struck out nine and
walked one in eight innings for the win.
 &UR; Mets 2, Rockies 1
	   In New York, Masato Yoshii allowed one run in 7 2-3 innings to
earn his first win since May 27 and Mike Piazza had a clutch hit
for the second straight game.
	   New York swept the three-game series and won for 10th time in
its last 13 contests. The victory gave the Mets a one-game lead in
the National League wild-card race over the Chicago Cubs, who
earlier lost to St. Louis.
	   The Rockies lost for the fourth straight time and are 1-5 in
their last six games.
	   Yoshii (5-6) was winless in his last 14 starts, with a record of
0-5 during that period. He allowed only a leadoff homer to Darryl
Hamilton, nine hits overall, and struck out six. The right-hander
also drew a walk and scored New York's first run on Piazza's RBI
single in the third.
	   Bobby Jones (5-7) gave up both runs on five hits and walked four
in six innings.
	    &UR; MORE
 &UR; Giants 6, Braves 2
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Charlie Hayes' two-run single highlighted a
four-run third inning and backed six solid innings by Mark Gardner
as San Francisco defeated Tom Glavine and Atlanta.
	   Glavine (16-6) failed to become the first NL pitcher with 17
wins and his scoreless streak of 23 innings was snapped in the
first.
	   The Atlanta left-hander gave up five runs on eight hits and four
walks in five innings.
	   Gardner (10-5) allowed seven hits and walked two without
recording a strikeout.

Landslip threatens Australian homes after floods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ More than 130 people were evacuated
from 50 homes in a flood-stricken area Thursday after a hillside
slid within 300 feet (100 meters) of their houses.
	   Emergency services are keeping an eye on the entire western
perimeter of Wollongong, which was declared a disaster area after
heavy rain earlier this week boosted the possibility of landslides.
	   Wollongong is about 40 miles (65 km) south of Sydney, on the New
South Wales coast.
	   Tons of rock and mud slid around 65 feet (20 meters) down Mount
Kembla on a 650-foot (200-meter) front shortly after 7 a.m., a
police spokeswoman said. Around 130 residents were taken to the
Mount Kembla Hotel.
	   The potential remained for the landslip to cause major damage to
homes in the area or for other landslips to occur, a State
Emergency Service spokesman said.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer said he would visit Wollongong
on Thursday afternoon to meet with local authorities and emergency
workers before inspecting damaged areas.
	   Hundreds of emergency workers are continuing the clean-up
operation after downpours on Monday night damaged hundreds of
homes, closed roads and turned creeks into torrents.

Aquino wants Ver to tell truth about her husband's assassination
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Former Philippine President Corazon
Aquino said Thursday a former military chief of staff under late
dictator Ferdinand Marcos should now tell the truth about her
husband's assassination 15 years ago.
	   On Wednesday, President Joseph Estrada said he will allow former
Gen. Fabian Ver to return to the Philippines after fleeing the
country with Marcos at the height of the 1986 ``people power''
revolt that toppled the strongman.
	   Estrada said Ver has to face charges in the Aug. 21, 1983
assassination of opposition leader Benigno Aquino Jr., who was shot
moments after he stepped off the plane on his return from exile in
the United States.
	   The assassination triggered massive anti-Marcos protests that
culminated in the revolt that swept Aquino's widow to the
presidency.
	   ``What is more important is for (Ver) to tell us the truth, and
I hope he won't add to the lies in the past,'' Aquino said in a
radio interview.
	   Aquino believes Marcos, who died in Hawaii in 1989, masterminded
her husband's assassination.
	   Marcos denied any role in the murder and said Aquino was killed
by a communist-hired assassin, Rolando Galman, who was shot dead by
soldiers moments after Aquino was gunned down on the Manila airport
tarmac.
	   Estrada, however, said that Ver cannot be forced to identify the
mastermind of the assassination.
	   ``We are in a democracy,'' he said. ``It is his right if he
wants to speak or not. If he does not want to testify, we cannot
force him.''
	   Ver and 25 other soldiers were acquitted of Aquino's murder
three months before Marcos was ousted.
	   After Corazon Aquino took office, the Supreme Court ordered a
new trial, which lasted three years. Sixteen soldiers were
convicted of killing her husband and Galman. But the trial failed
to determine whether Marcos or his associates ordered the
assassinations.
	   Ver, who was accused as an accomplice, was not tried in his
absence and the case against him has been shelved.

As Omagh buries its dead, Irish government announces tougher

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Roman Catholics and Protestants
alike buried 16 bombing victims, while the Irish government vowed
to strengthen its anti-terrorist laws to prevent follow-up attacks
to Northern Ireland's deadliest attack.
	   Columns of grief-stricken residents followed hearses that snaked
slowly through the bomb-ravaged center of Omagh Wednesday. More
funerals for victims of political violence were held Wednesday than
in any other single day during Northern Ireland's three decades of
sectarian violence.
	   The final eight victims were to be buried Thursday.
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern announced plans to close down
the Irish Republican Army dissidents who planted Saturday's car
bomb that killed 28 people and wounded 220.
	   Ahern said he considered his government's initiatives
``extremely draconian'' but added he was not prepared to risk more
attacks by dissidents of the Real IRA splinter group, which
admitted responsibility for the carbombing.
	   The group refuses to adhere to the IRA's July 1997 truce and
announced Wednesday only that it had ``suspended'' its bombing
campaign in light of the Omagh carnage, which it called
unintentional.
	   The proposals approved by an emergency session of Ahern's
Cabinet _ most of which already are in place north of the Irish
border _ included restricting the right to bail for suspected
terrorists, allowing judges to infer guilt if a suspect refuses to
answer questions, and extending the allowable time to hold suspects
without charge from 48 hours to 96 hours.
	   People also could be convicted of belonging to outlawed groups
if a senior detective testifies they are members.
	   Ahern said the measures would become law within two weeks to
defend both Northern Ireland's peace agreement ``and the people of
both parts of this island from attack by groups who have no
legitimacy whatsoever.''
	   With controlled anger, he noted his visit Tuesday to the Irish
Republic town of Buncrana, where three bomb victims ranging from 8
to 12 were buried Wednesday.
	   ``When you stand ... in a room with the body of a young boy, a
beautiful young boy, who should be out playing football on what was
a fine day, who should be looking forward to seeing his boyhood
dreams come true ... it brings home to you what you're dealing
with,'' Ahern said.
	   Seeking to head off a crackdown, the dissidents _ who began
planting car bombs in Northern Ireland towns in February hoping to
thwart the Belfast peace talks _ said they suspended ``all military
operations'' pending internal debate on future strategy.
	   Bernadette Sands-McKevitt, the common-law wife of Michael
McKevitt, the reputed leader of the Real IRA, told Irish radio that
she was pleased with the group's announcement.
	   ``I have already condemned it and we could not condone it,'' she
said of the Omagh attack, which she added had nothing to do with
her or McKevitt.
	   Local reports said the couple had moved from their home in the
Irish Republic border town of Dundalk for fear of attacks. Several
hundred people rallied in the town after dark Wednesday in support
of the Omagh victims and against McKevitt, although they cancelled
plans to march to his home.
	   Politicians on both sides heaped scorn on the Real IRA
statement.
	   ``It's too late for those who were massacred,'' said Pat
Doherty, vice president of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party.
	   And Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble, the Protestant
who was named first minister of Northern Ireland's new
cross-community government, called the statement contemptible and
untrustworthy.
	   On Wednesday, soldiers erected a steel wall at the Market Street
crossroads where the 500-pound (227-kilo) car bomb detonated. That
blocked the destruction from the view of the mile-long (1.6
kilometer-long) funeral processions which passed silently through
the town from churches to cemeteries.
	   Those businesses not damaged by the bomb closed for the day,
pinning messages and floral tributes to their front doors.
	   Medical staff at the local hospital for the first time offered
harrowing accounts Wednesday of how they battled in the first
hellish hours of the attack last Saturday, when they were
overwhelmed with more than 200 wounded.
	   Administrators of the town's County Tyrone Hospital confirmed
Wednesday that the casualty toll from the attack by an IRA
dissident gang actually topped 330, a figure lost in the frenetic
scramble to ship wounded by ambulance and helicopter to other
Northern Ireland hospitals.
	   ``Nothing could have prepared me for what I saw,'' said Thomas
McFarland, a mental health nurse pressed into emergency service.
	   ``You could not really be trained for what you had seen unless
you were trained in Vietnam or somewhere like that,'' he said.
	   And at every funeral, pews filled to overflowing. Hundreds stood
outside in the rain as entire communities _ Protestant and Catholic
alike _ rallied behind the families.
	   ``In our terrible experience of the last 30 years, Omagh was the
worst atrocity of them all,'' said retired Catholic Bishop Edward
Daly. ``Is it too much to ask or too much to hope that it will be
the last atrocity of all?'' he asked at the Requiem Mass for
21-month-old Breda Devine.

Floods swamp key Chinese oil field, threaten major cities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARBIN, China (AP) _ Floods swamped part of China's largest oil
field Thursday, forcing 100,000 people to flee nearby villages and
cutting a railway line needed for bringing in relief supplies.
	   Thousands of soldiers struggled to fortify the 280 kilometers
(170 miles) of dikes surrounding the Daqing oil field in
northeastern China's Heilongjiang province. Experts warned the
dikes were in ``critical condition'' after being waterlogged for
weeks, the China Daily reported.
	   In Harbin, the provincial capital, soldiers in groups of 50
marched through the streets holding red flags and singing as they
went off to man a 2-meter-high (6-foot-high) dike of sandbags
protecting the city from the swollen Songhua River.
	   Water seeped through an embankment and flooded parks along the
river. Flooding was widespread in rural areas on the bank opposite
the city.
	   The floods were precipitated by unusually heavy rain. Further
south, the Yangtze River basin in central China has suffered its
worst flooding in 44 years.
	   More than 2,000 people have died nationwide in flooding, and
economic losses are expected to reach dlrs 24 billion.
	   Harbin's main roads along the river were closed to ordinary
traffic, as were all but one city bridge spanning the river.
	   Soldiers piled up sandbags, bracing for the Songhua to crest
again Friday.
	   In the area of the Daqing oil field, floods on the Nen River
swamped the town of Xingzhan Tuesday and moved south. More than
100,000 people living up to 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of
Xingzhan were being evacuated, the China Daily said.
	   More than 1,200 wells at Daqing were swamped, and 527 others
stopped production, the People's Daily reported. Floods also were
hampering oil drilling in another major field in neighboring Jilin
province, it said.
	   Floods on Wednesday destroyed a railway line near Daqing, where
China gets more than one-third of its domestic oil supply. A rush
repair team of 400 people was working to open the line to get
relief supplies in, the Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   The Nen also flooded parts of Inner Mongolia. Prisoners in
low-lying parts of that area leaned out of windows yelling for help
before they were evacuated from six prisons, the Legal Daily
reported.
	   The Ministry of Civil Affairs made an urgent appeal for warm
clothing, tents and blankets for flood victims in the northeast.
	   In central China, flood crests converged Wednesday on the
Yangtze and Han rivers where they meet in Wuhan, a regional
industrial center. Pools of water seeped through dikes as 9,000
People's Liberation Army soldiers rushed to make urgent repairs.
	   Forecasters said the Yangtze would reach its highest level so
far this year as a surge of floodwaters reaches Wuhan on Friday.
	   Flooding was heavy at Dongting Lake, on the Yangtze's middle
reaches, where water levels reached a record level Wednesday. One
million soldiers and civilians were trying to maintain
1,500-kilometer- (930-mile-) long levees along the lake.
	   The government-controlled news media has given little
information about flood damage or deaths, and instead has been
ordered to play up floodfighting efforts.
	   The floods are ``binding the nation together and bringing to
life the most essential things that define us as a nation,'' an
editorial in China Daily said Thursday.
	   ``Together we resisted and foiled the most atrocious of foreign
aggressions; together we survived the most tragic economic and
political turmoils in history,'' it said, adding: ``Hand in hand we
are an impregnable embankment against the floods.''

China launches two U.S.-made satellites
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Chinese rocket successfully launched two
U.S.-made satellites into orbit Thursday, the state-run Xinhua News
Agency reported.
	   The Long March 2C rocket was launched from the Taiyuan center in
Shanxi province in north China, Xinhua said. The satellites are
part of a mobile telecommunications system developed by Motorola
Corp. of the United States for Iridium.
	   The launch had originally been planned for mid-July but was
delayed at Motorola's request due to technical reasons, Xinhua
said, without giving details.
	   China's three-stage Long March 2C carrier rocket was designed
especially to launch Iridium satellites, and has been used
successfully five times, it said.

U.S. financier backs Fiji hotel project
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT KEITH-REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ U.S. finance group Pacific Hotel Partners has
formed a 50-50 joint venture with Nauru's government to restore and
enlarge Suva's 84-year-old Grand Pacific Hotel for management by
Outrigger Hotels and Resorts of Hawaii.
	   Pacific Hotel Partners is led by Washington D.C. businessman
Thor Larsen.
	   Bill Henderson, Outrigger's vice president for business
development, said Thursday that construction will begin in 30 to 60
days with the aim of reopening the ``Grand Dame'' of Pacific hotels
in time for the 2000 millennium night.
	   Henderson said the GPH, as it is known throughout the Pacific,
is truly ``historic and unique'' and Outrigger was already getting
booking inquiries from people who wanted to experience its
Edwardian charm.
	   The main body of the original hotel, opened on the Suva
waterfront in 1914, will be restored and two wings in the same
style added to 136 guest rooms, two presidential suites, and
convention and business service facilities.
	   After its construction and opening in 1914 by the Union Steam
Ship Co. of New Zealand, the GPH attained a reputation comparable
to the Raffles Hotel in Singapore and The Peninsula in Hong Kong.
	   About 1969 it was sold to the Cathay group of Singapore and in
1988 was bought by the Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust, a Nauru
government agency.
	   It has stood empty, decaying and shuttered for several years
pending redevelopment.
	   Henderson said Larsen's company, Pacific Hotel Partners, has
formed a joint venture company, Grand Pacific Hotel Ltd., with
Nauru companies Pacific Star Company Ltd. and the Nauru Phosphate
Royalties Trust.

Thai commerce minister to form independent export panel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's commerce minister said
Thursday his ministry will create an independent agency to oversee
exports as a part of the government's economic reform plans.
	   Exports are the key to Thailand's economic growth, especially
during the country's year-old financial crisis.
	   Currently, the Commerce Ministry oversees various agencies that
promote and regulate exports. Minister Supachai Panichpakdi, who is
also a deputy prime minister and a key economic advisor to Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai, said the new panel would consist of both
government and private sector appointees.
	   Thailand's exports showed no growth in 1996, as rising labor
costs and inefficient manufacturing processes caused many products
to become uncompetitive.
	   The drop in exports caused many manufacturers to default on
loans, undermining the banking and financial sectors and helping to
precipitate the country's economic crisis.
	   The crisis erupted in full force when Thailand floated its
currency, the baht, in July 1997. It has fallen against the dollar
by about 37 percent.
	   The cheaper baht has, however, given new life to many exports
that had become uncompetitive.
	   Exports increased by 62 percent during the first half of 1998
compared to the same period last year.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sydney Olympics organizers have chosen
Aboriginal athlete Nova Peris-Kneebone to take the first Australian
steps of the year 2000 torch relay. Their chief indigenous adviser
wants SOCOG to go a step further.
	   Lois O'Donoghue said Thursday that she would like the SOCOG
board to honor an Aboriginal with the task of lighting the Olympic
flame when the Games are opened on Sept. 15, 2000.
	   ``That would be nice. I'm not sure we would be consulted about
that but it doesn't mean we won't make some comment at some
stage,'' said O'Donoghue, chair of the National Indigenous Advisory
Committee (NIAC) formed to monitor Aboriginal input into the 2000
Games.
	   O'Donoghue said the Olympics should become a forum to facilitate
reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians
divided by disputes over land rights.
	   ``All of us feel the process of reconciliation has stalled
somewhat and we need to make sure that within SOCOG, and everything
we do leading into the Games that it is to do with reconciliation
(in mind),'' O'Donoghue said.
	   Peris-Kneebone, 27, is the only Australian Aboriginal to have
won an Olympic gold medal. She was on Australia's victorious field
hockey team at the Atlanta Olympics but quit the sport following
the Games to pursue a track career. She hopes to qualify for the
sprint events at the Sydney Olympics.
	   ``It's an honor and it's going to give me a big energy boost for
the next few years, I'm going to be one helluva proud Australian,''
Peris-Kneebone said Thursday.
	   There have been past threats by Aboriginal groups to disrupt the
Games with protests about their struggle for land rights.
O'Donoghue has said Aboriginal groups would ``rightly'' use the
Games as focus.
	   Peris-Kneebone, who is from Darwin in the Northern Territory,
said the decision to have her launch the relay when the flame
arrives in Australia in June 2000 would be received well in
Aboriginal communities.
	   ``Every time I go back home or travel to remote communities
around Australia the Aboriginal people show they love sport,''
Peris-Kneebone said. ``To have an Aboriginal person carrying that
flame is going to make a lot of people very proud.''
	   While details of the 100-day Australian leg of the torch relay
have not been made public, O'Donoghue said the flame would visit
remote Aboriginal communities.
	   World 400-meter champion Cathy Freeman is Australia's best known
Aboriginal athlete but Peris-Kneebone has impressed as a public
speaker, addressing a recent convention on an Australian republic.
	   O'Donoghue hopes Peris-Kneebone's selection will raise the
profile of Aborigines, and prove they can be successful.
	   ``Nova, when she spoke at the convention, said how disappointed
she was as she went around the world that people were surprised
that there were black people in Australia,'' O'Donoghue said.
``They just thought she came from somewhere else.''
	   NIAC has no formal representation on SOCOG's torch relay
committee but O'Donoghue said the advisory body was keeping a close
eye on SOCOG.
	   ``We want to be absolutely sure that there is indigenous content
in the opening and closing ceremonies of the Games and we also want
in welcomes to all the events as they happen,'' O'Donoghue said.
The welcomes would involve ``traditional owners of the land''
greeting athletes at all venues, O'Donoghue said.

President of small Japanese firm, employee commit suicide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Troubled by financial difficulties, the president
of a small firm and one of his employees committed suicide together
Thursday, a police spokesman said.
	   The deaths were the latest in a rash of business-related
suicides in Japan, which is suffering its worst recession in
decades.
	   Tomoyuki Watanabe, a local police spokesman, identified the two
men as Nobuo Shibata, 48, president of a sheet metal manufacturing
firm near Tokyo, and employee Yoshio Kimura, 56.
	   The two were found dead inside a passenger car in the company
compound after they had inhaled exhaust gas through a hose run
through the car's back seat early Thursday morning, Watanabe said.
	   Police found a note in Shibata's pocket that read: ``I am sorry
to all of my employees for causing a poor (business) performance,''
Watanabe said.
	   In March, the president of a small firm and his wife hanged
themselves in their living room because of financial difficulties.
Financial troubles also led three Japanese businessmen to hang
themselves in a hotel in February.
	   Japan's prolonged economic slump has hit especially hard at
small- and medium-sized businesses, many of which are facing
difficulties in getting bank loans.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Roman Catholics and Protestants
alike buried 16 bombing victims, while the Irish government vowed
to strengthen its anti-terrorist laws to prevent follow-up attacks
to Northern Ireland's deadliest attack.
	   Columns of grief-stricken residents followed hearses that snaked
slowly through the bomb-ravaged center of Omagh Wednesday. More
funerals for victims of political violence were held Wednesday than
in any other single day during Northern Ireland's three decades of
sectarian violence.
	   The final eight victims were to be buried Thursday.
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern announced plans to close down
the Irish Republican Army dissidents who planted Saturday's car
bomb that killed 28 people and wounded 220.
	   Ahern said he considered his government's initiatives
``extremely draconian'' but added he was not prepared to risk more
attacks by dissidents of the Real IRA splinter group, which
admitted responsibility for the carbombing.
	   The group refuses to adhere to the IRA's July 1997 truce and
announced Wednesday only that it had ``suspended'' its bombing
campaign in light of the Omagh carnage, which it called
unintentional.
	   The proposals approved by an emergency session of Ahern's
Cabinet _ most of which already are in place north of the Irish
border _ included restricting the right to bail for suspected
terrorists, allowing judges to infer guilt if a suspect refuses to
answer questions, and extending the allowable time to hold suspects
without charge from 48 hours to 96 hours.
	   People also could be convicted of belonging to outlawed groups
if a senior detective testifies they are members.
	   Ahern said the measures would become law within two weeks to
defend both Northern Ireland's peace agreement ``and the people of
both parts of this island from attack by groups who have no
legitimacy whatsoever.''
	   With controlled anger, he noted his visit Tuesday to the Irish
Republic town of Buncrana, where three bomb victims ranging from 8
to 12 were buried Wednesday.
	   ``When you stand ... in a room with the body of a young boy, a
beautiful young boy, who should be out playing football on what was
a fine day, who should be looking forward to seeing his boyhood
dreams come true ... it brings home to you what you're dealing
with,'' Ahern said.
	   Funerals for the 28 dead began Tuesday, when a mother and her
child were buried in Northern Ireland and two Spanish tourists
killed in the bombing were buried in Spain. Mourners buried 16 more
on Wednesday and funerals for the final eight were planned for
Thursday.

Dollar sinks in Tokyo, Japanese stocks close lower

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell sharply against the yen
Thursday amid growing worry about possible government intervention
to support the Japanese currency. Tokyo stock prices closed lower.
	   The dollar bought 142.87 yen in mid-afternoon trading, down 1.29
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York
rate of 143.93 yen overnight.
	   Worry about possible yen-supportive intervention in foreign
exchange markets by monetary authorities kept the dollar under
pressure following a recent rally to eight-year highs against the
yen, dealers said.
	   ``We'd like to be well prepared for intervention,'' said Tatsuya
Ishii, senior sales manager and head of customer foreign exchange
at Banque Nationale de Paris in Tokyo. ``At the moment, the
dollar's downside risk is greater than the upside.''
	   The latest in a series of not-so-veiled warnings came Thursday
from the head of the Japanese Finance Ministry's international
bureau, Haruhiko Kuroda.
	   ``We will intervene appropriately as necessary,'' Kuroda said,
adding that the ministry still views the yen as too weak against
the dollar.
	   On Wednesday, Japan's influential vice finance minister for
international affairs, Eisuke Sakakibara, warned that the
opportunity for yen-supportive intervention ``is getting near.''
	   Sakakibara, who arrived in the United States later Wednesday to
attend a financial conference, was expected to meet with U.S.
Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. The meeting has led to
speculation joint intervention to bolster the yen may be under
discussion.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, meanwhile, share prices moved lower
as investors took profits following a more than 600-point rise in
the main index over the past two days.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 14.93 points,
or 0.10 percent, to close at 15,391.41. On Wednesday, the average
closed up 342.55 points, or 2.27 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section lost 2.04 points, or 0.17 percent, to 1,181.67. The
TOPIX closed up 16.99 points, or 1.46 percent, the day before.
	   In the fixed-income security market, the yield on the benchmark
No. 182 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.190 percent,
down from 1.195 percent on Wednesday. Its price rose to 111.80 yen
from 111.77 yen.

	   In Seattle, Toronto hit a season-high seven home runs, two each
by Shawn Green and Carlos Delgado, and Ken Griffey Jr.'s home run
slump continued for Seattle.
	   Jose Cruz Jr., Darrin Fletcher and Felipe Crespo also homered
for the Blue Jays, who have the third most homers in the AL with
165. Delgado tied his career high with five RBIs and Green drove in
four runs.
	   The seven home runs allowed by Seattle pitchers was a club
record.
	   Pat Hentgen (11-9) allowed four hits in five innings on a night
when the Blue Jays hit four of their homers off Ken Cloude (7-9) in
the first three innings to take a 6-0 lead.
	   Griffey, the AL leader with 42 homers, went 0-for-2 with a walk
and has one homer in his last 73 at bats over 17 games.

Two more sightseers left stranded off Great Barrier Reef

	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ In the second such incident in less
than a year, a pair of sightseers were stranded off Australia's
Great Barrier Reef after being abandoned by a local dive boat
operator, officials said Thursday.
	   The two Australian men, whose names were not released, were left
behind Sunday, but were picked up soon afterwards by a nearby
vessel, Queensland state Transport Minister Steve Bredhauer said.
	   Capt. John Watkinson, Queensland Transport's executive director
of maritime, said the men had been on a snorkeling and sightseeing
trip to the Lady Musgrave Island reef, off Bundaberg in southeast
Queensland.
	   The matter has been reported to the Gladstone Harbor Master and
a full investigation was under way, he said.
	   The abandonment at sea follows the controversial disappearance
of Thomas and Eileen Lonergan, a couple from Baton Rouge,
Louisiana, on Jan. 25.
	   Lonergan, 33, and his 28-year old wife were last seen when they
went diving from a dive boat at St. Crispin Reef, 45 miles (72
kilometers) northeast of Port Douglas.
	   A coroner's inquiry into their fate will reopen in Cairns on
Sept. 7. It has already decided that they did not fake their deaths
or die in a murder-suicide, but were left behind and drowned.

Cambodian authorities seek delay in massive opposition rally
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Setting up a showdown, the Interior
Ministry on Thursday rejected a request by the opposition to stage
a massive weekend demonstration against election fraud, calling for
a one-day postponement.
	   Interior Ministry spokesman Khieu Sopheak said that the
demonstration could not be held Sunday because it is too costly to
pay security forces to work over the weekend ``and they need some
leisure time, too.''
	   Protest organizers said they had not officially been notified of
the decision early Thursday but vowed to go ahead with the rally as
planned Sunday, normally a day off when more people would be able
to demonstrate.
	   ``They have no legal right to prohibit the protest,'' the
opposition Sam Rainsy Party said in a statement.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party and Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC,
the two main opposition groups, began publicizing the event and
were handing out leaflets and driving through Phnom Penh with sound
trucks. They hope to draw at least 10,000 people.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party feared that ``members of the security
forces or other ruling party forces will use threats or violence to
try to stop our members from exercising their legal political
rights.''
	   Strongman Hun Sen's ruling party won a slight majority of 64 of
the 122 seats in last month's parliamentary elections, short of the
two-thirds needed to form a new government.
	   FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party _ which together won 58 seats
_ have threatened to boycott the new parliament and block the
formation of a government unless their claims that Hun Sen won by
massive fraud are investigated.
	   The opposition parties have demanded hundreds of recounts, but
the Hun Sen-controlled National Election Committee dismissed their
complaints as ``baseless'' and have forwarded only a few to the
Constitutional Council, the final authority.
	   Opposition leader Sam Rainsy said that no international
observers have been keeping watch over election ballots, many of
which are unsecured, since they were brought to Phnom Penh from the
provinces early this month.
	   Sam Rainsy said his own party agents have been prevented from
entering the NEC headquarters where ballots are kept and have been
sleeping outside the building. He said he would join them there
overnight Thursday.

Palestinian police capture two escaped prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian security forces on
Thursday captured two Palestinian security prisoners who had
escaped a day before, a senior security official said.
	   One of the prisoners reportedly was serving a 17-year term with
hard labor for killing an Israeli taxi driver.
	   Wednesday's escape came only days after a leader of the Islamic
militant group Hamas, Imad Awadallah, fled from a Jericho prison,
setting off a massive manhunt during which the desert oasis was put
under curfew for a day.
	   The recent escapes were an embarrassment to Palestinian security
forces and raised Israeli suspicions that the prisoners had inside
help in getting away.
	   The Israeli government has long claimed that the Palestinian
Authority is lax in dealing with Islamic militants and security
prisoners, a charge denied by Palestinian officials.

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Authorities on Thursday began evacuating
50,000 people from towns and villages threatened by rising water in
the Indian Himalayas, where landslides killed an estimated 239
people during the past two days, officials said.
	   Engineers planned to dynamite a blockage of boulders and mud in
the Mandakini River, which was backing up and forming a lake that
threatened to submerge five towns and 25 villages.
	   Working with flash lights, rescue workers found six bodies
trapped under rocks in the village of Malpa, where more than 200
Hindu pilgrims, porters and local villagers were believed killed
Tuesday when a river suddenly changed its course and swept them
away.
	   Three more landslides struck Wednesday, killing 37 people in the
area about 300 kilometers (180 miles) north of New Delhi where
farmers and villagers have stripped mountains of their trees for
firewood and to make way for terraced crop fields.
	   Rescuers recovered nine bodies on Wednesday and found 18
survivors shivering from cold and in shock.
	   Bad weather Thursday hampered rescue efforts in Malpa, a rest
stop on a popular pilgrimage route to a shrine in Tibet known as
the Abode of Bliss sacred to both Hindus and Buddhists.
	   ``There is no likelihood of helicopters flying to Malpa today,''
said R.N. Singhal, the divisional commissioner.
	   In the first available eyewitness account of the disaster, Ganga
Pandit, a priest, said he was awakened by a distant rumbling.
	   Pandit dragged his wife and son from their hut and struggled up
the slopes. Glancing back, Pandit saw a river of water, mud and
boulders hurtle through the valley.
	   ``I saw a hill on the east of the village virtually bursting. It
was like a bomb exploding,'' said Pandit. ``Within minutes, the
shouts and wails were drowned, and all that was heard was the
gushing water.''
	   With vehicles unable to use any roads in the area, soldiers
organized rescue teams and crawled through mud and over slippery
rocks to reach what the teams' leader, Lt. Sunil Kumar, called ``a
valley of death.'' Many of the bodies apparently had been washed
away in the torrent, and the valley was strewn with backpacks, gas
stoves and cans of food.
	   The pilgrims had reached the camp site Sunday. But bad weather
hampered them from setting out for the four-faced Himalayan peak,
known as Kailasha, which Hindus revere as the dwelling place of the
god Shiva.
	   The pilgrims, many with mountaineering training, typically make
the 120-mile (190-kilometer), 12-day trek at this time of year. The
government accepts only the strong on the officially organized
journeys because of the rough terrain. About 960 were approved to
go this year.
	   Near the site of Tuesday's slide, troops and doctors waded
through deep mud with little hope of finding more survivors. Army
divers made two attempts to swim through the furious currents but
were beaten back, said one of the divers, Himmat Singh.
	   An Aug. 12 mudslide killed at least 42 people and hundreds of
animals in the same region, which also was devastated by an
earthquake in 1991 that killed 341 people. Geologists warned of
worse catastrophes if torrential monsoons continued.

<TEXT>
	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ Pete Sampras, still haunted by a
3-day-old controversial call, allowed Lleyton Hewitt to break him
twice and force a tiebreaker before dismissing the young Australian
6-1, 7-6 (7-4) Wednesday and advancing to the third round of the
Pilot Pen International.
	   Sampras, the No. 1 seed, dropped the first game of the match,
serving, and later said he was having trouble acclimating himself
to his first appearance in New Haven.
	   ``My tennis will get better. I certainly hope it will get
better,'' he said, after the 72-minute duel.
	   Sampras also said he was still dwelling on Sunday's loss to
Patrick Rafter in the final of the ATP Championship in Cincinnati,
which placed in jeopardy his goal to end the year at No. 1 in the
world. The match ended on a serve by Rafter that was first called
out, then ruled an ace by the umpire.
	   ``I don't like losing matches. I don't like losing, period,
especially that way,'' he said, adding that he most wants to play
Rafter this week.
	   Rafter, seeded second, beat Jeff Tarango 6-2, 6-1 Wednesday
night to advance to the third round. Rafter, ranked No. 3 in the
world, and Sampras would meet in the tournament final.
	   Hewitt, whom Sampras called an up-and-coming player in need of a
big weapon, said he was overwhelmed by the Wimbledon champion's
serve. Sampras rocketed 12 aces, consistently serving faster than
120 mph (193 kph).
	   Hewitt had beaten Andre Agassi earlier in the year to win the
Australian Hardcourt Championships. He had said his goal in playing
Sampras was to stay relaxed. But after falling behind 4-1 in the
first set and in the middle of dropping one of four service games,
the 17-year-old struck his racket on the court, breaking it.
	   ``I was a set down before I knew it,'' Hewitt said. ``At the
time you really don't know what to do.''
	   Also Wednesday, third-seeded Petr Korda defeated Andrei Medvedev
6-3, 2-6, 6-1. Korda, ranked No. 4 in the world, will face fellow
Czech Bohdan Ulihrach, seeded 13th.
	   Korda, the Australian Open champ, acknowledged he is the
favorite of the two.
	   ``I think he has nothing to lose. What I'm really looking for is
to play as well as I can before the U.S. Open,'' he said.
	   Defending Pilot Pen champ Yevgeny Kafelnikov demolished
Australian Todd Woodbridge 6-0, 6-3 in 48 minutes.
	   ``I never thought it would be so easy,'' he said.
	   Kafelnikov, the fifth-seed from Russia, advances to play No. 11
Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil, who beat Alex O'Brien 6-3, 6-2.
	   In other matches, Davide Sanguinetti of Italy upset 12th-seeded
Fabrice Santoro of France 6-1, 6-7 (7-2), 7-5, Britain's Tim
Henman, seeded sixth, advanced 6-2, 6-3 over Vincenzo Santopadre of
Italy, and No. 4 seed Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands beat
MaliVai Washington 7-5, 6-4.

New batch of Lebanese evacuees arrives from Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Some 250 Lebanese fleeing the armed
conflict in Congo arrived here Thursday, the second group to arrive
this week.
	   They landed at Beirut International Airport aboard a chartered
Nigerian plane shortly after midnight Wednesday.
	   Thousands of foreigners have evacuated Congo since the
two-week-old rebellion against President Laurent Kabila started and
escalated into an insurgency.
	   On Sunday, 350 Lebanese, mostly women and children, arrived in
Beirut also aboard a Nigerian plane. At least 600 Lebanese, many of
them businessmen, were still in Congo.
	   Tens of thousands of Lebanese have settled in West African
countries after fleeing the 1975-90 civil war in their country,
establishing successful businesses.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Anatoly Chubais, Russia's liaison to Western
creditors, has been at the center of the country's economic crisis
for weeks. Early Thursday, he found himself in the middle of a
hotter emergency.
	   Fire broke out at the headquarters of Russia's national electric
utility, which Chubais heads, and he spent the night at the scene
overseeing efforts to extinguish the blaze.
	   Chubais stood in fumes on the roof of the seven-story building
of the state-controlled Unified Energy Systems (UES) as over 300
firemen backed by several dozen fire engines and a helicopter
battled the blaze. The building is just a few hundred meters
(yards) from the Kremlin.
	   It took firefighters more than seven hours to extinguish the
blaze. Three firemen were injured, said a spokesman for the Moscow
fire brigade.
	   ``The firefighters worked very effectively,'' a disheveled
Chubais said on the RTR TV network, shaking hands with a fire
chief.
	   Officials had feared the fire might spread to the UES control
room and disable the nation's power grid, but firemen managed to
contain it.
	   It was not immediately clear what sparked the blaze, but
authorities believed it was caused by a short-circuit.

Major quake shakes offshore Japanese islands, no injury reports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A major earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of
7.1 shook the Ogasawara islands south of Tokyo on Thursday, but
there were immediate reports of damage or injuries.
	   The quake, which struck at 3:42 p.m. (0642GMT), was centered a
deep 410 kilometers (246 miles) under the seabed off Torishima
island, roughly 600 kilometers (360 miles) south of Tokyo, the
Meteorological Agency announced.
	   The agency said there was no fear of tsunami _ undersea waves
triggered by volcanic activity or earthquakes _ arising from the
quake.
	   The quake was felt in Tokyo and caused some buildings to sway.
	   A quake of magnitude 7 is considered major and is capable of
causing widespread, heavy damage.
	   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations as it
sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across the
earth's surface.

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian security forces on
Thursday captured two Palestinian prisoners, including the killer
of an Israeli taxi driver, who had escaped the day before, a senior
official said.
	   The escape came only days after a leader of the Islamic militant
group Hamas, Imad Awadallah, fled from a Jericho lockup, setting
off a massive manhunt during which the desert oasis was put under
curfew for a day.
	   The recent escapes were an embarrassment to Palestinian security
forces and raised Israeli suspicions that the prisoners had inside
help in getting away.
	   The Israeli government has long claimed that the Palestinian
Authority is lax in dealing with Islamic militants and security
prisoners, a charge denied by Palestinian officials.
	   One of the prisoners captured Thursday, Iyad Abu Sabab, was
serving 15 years for killing an Israeli taxi driver in a botched
robbery last year, Palestinian security officials said.

Christine Arron challenges sprint supremacy of Marion Jones
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The next challenge to the sprinting
supremacy of Marion Jones might come from a young French woman with
orange-dyed hair.
	   Christine Arron, a 24-year-old native of Guadeloupe, overcame a
slow start to win the women's 100 meters Wednesday at the European
Championships, setting a continental record of 10.73 seconds.
	   That just missed the times of 10.71 and 10.72 clocked by Jones,
the U.S. star and world champion. Jones has run each time twice
this year.
	   Both still have to improve before they can approach the world
record of 10.49 set by Florence Griffith-Joyner in 1988.
	   ``Now I hope to improve more and stay healthy and do something
really nice next year at the worlds,'' Arron said.
	   If Arron is closing in on Jones, the European men are still way
behind the North Americans.
	   Darren Campbell led a 1-2 British finish in the men's 100,
clocking 10.04 seconds to set a championship record and a personal
best.
	   Campbell is coached by Linford Christie, the retired ace who won
the last three European titles and was the last European to
successfully battle the North Americans.
	   But Campbell was quick to issue a challenge.
	   ``I am No. 1 in Europe now. This is one of the stepping stones
that Linford and I have planned so that we can take on the
Americans seriously,'' the 24-year-old Briton said.
	   Arron trailed Irina Privalova of Russia early in the women's
100. But with her powerful stride, Arron caught Privalova in the
last 20 meters (yards) and stole the title and the European record
from the Russian, who is coming off leg surgery.
	   ``It was a difficult race for me because Privalova had a very
good start,'' Arron said.
	   ``Halfway through the race I saw Privalova from the corner of my
eye and I accelerated between 60 and 80 meters,'' she said.
	   Privalova clocked 10.83 to win the silver in her fastest race
this year. Her 1994 European record was 10.77.
	   Ekaterini Thanou of Greece won the bronze in 10.87 and set a
national record.
	   Arron's performance overshadowed the British triumph in the
men's dash.
	   Campbell, who once nearly quit track to take up soccer, edged
another upcoming British sprinter, Dwain Chambers, who took the
silver in 10.10. Charalambos Papadias of Greece won the bronze in
10.17.
	   ``Linford has prepared me brilliantly for this,'' Campbell said.
``I knew I was going to win it. I wasn't surprised I won and I
wasn't nervous out there. In fact I felt really cool. I knew after
I was in contention at 60 meters, the race would be mine.
	   ``My start was a little bit dodgy, but I knew I would be strong
at the end.
	   ``I was really pleased Dwain was second. We said in the call-up
room it would be a 1-2, but we didn't know who would win,''
Campbell said.
	   Other gold medals of the day went to: Kiril Sosunov of Russia,
who cleared 27 feet, 2 inches (8.28 meters) to win the men's long
jump; Sonia O'Sullivan of Ireland, in the women's 10,000 meters
with a time of 31 minutes 29.33 seconds; Tibor Gescek of Hungary in
the men's hammer throw with a heave of 271-10 1/2 (82.86 meters);
and Tanja Damaske of Germany in the women's javelin at 226-8 (69.08
meters).

	   The recent escapes were an embarrassment to Palestinian security
forces and raised Israeli suspicions that the prisoners had inside
help in getting away.
	   The Israeli government has long claimed that the Palestinian
Authority is lax in dealing with Islamic militants and security
prisoners, a charge denied by Palestinian officials.
	   One of the prisoners captured Thursday, Iyad Abu Sabab, was
serving 15 years for killing an Israeli taxi driver in a botched
robbery last year, Palestinian security officials said.

Peres: massive expansion of Golan settlements a `provocation'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's decision to build 4,800 new homes in
the Golan Heights and effectively double the Israeli population
there is a ``provocation'' against Syria, former Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres said Thursday.
	   Peres' unusually harsh remarks came a day after a ministerial
committee headed by Cabinet hawk Ariel Sharon approved the
construction of 2,300 homes and 2,500 vacation units in four Golan
settlements.
	   Sharon said the construction was important for strengthening and
developing Israel's Golan settlements. Israel captured the heights
from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed the area in 1981.
	   Peres, a former key figure in peace negotiations with Syria,
said the decision by the government of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to expand the Golan settlements was ``superfluous,
irritating and unnecessary.''
	   ``Either they (government officials) should stop singing
serenades under Syria's window or they should stop indulging in
provocations,'' Peres told The Associated Press.
	   Earlier this week, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
twice urged Syria to resume peace talks that were suspended in
February 1996. In an interview with a German news magazine,
Mordechai also hinted that his government had softened its position
on a troop withdrawal in the Golan.
	   Syria wants to get back all of the Golan in exchange for a peace
treaty with Israel. Syria says that when the talks broke off in
1996, the Peres government had given the Syrians to understand that
for a full peace agreement, they could expect to get all of the
Golan.
	   The Syrians insist that the Netanyahu government recognize the
understandings Damascus reached with the previous Israeli
government. Netanyahu has refused to do so and has said continued
control over the Golan is vital for Israel's security.
	   Sharon's spokesman, Raanan Gissin, said the decision to build
more homes in the Golan came in response to public demand. ``Many
people want to live in this beautiful part of the country, and we
are working to fulfill that need,'' Gissin said.

Major quake shakes offshore Japanese islands, no injury reports

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of
7.1 shook the Ogasawara islands south of Tokyo on Thursday, but
there were immediate reports of damage or injuries.
	   The quake, which struck at 3:42 p.m. (0642GMT), was centered a
deep 410 kilometers (246 miles) under the seabed off Torishima
island, roughly 600 kilometers (360 miles) south of Tokyo, the
Meteorological Agency said.
	   Takashi Kameyama, an official with the Ogasawara islands public
office, said the quake was strong enough to rattle windows at his
office in Chichijima, 300 kilometers (180 miles) south of Torishima
island.
	   The Meteorological Agency said there was no fear of tsunami _
undersea waves triggered by volcanic activity or earthquakes.
	   The quake was felt in Tokyo and caused some buildings to sway.
	   A quake of magnitude 7 is considered major and is capable of
causing widespread, heavy damage.
	   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations as it
sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across the
earth's surface.

New batch of Lebanese evacuees arrives from Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Some 250 Lebanese fleeing the armed
conflict in Congo arrived here Thursday, the second group to arrive
this week.
	   They landed at Beirut International Airport aboard a chartered
Nigerian plane shortly after midnight Wednesday.
	   Thousands of foreigners have evacuated Congo since the
two-week-old rebellion against President Laurent Kabila started and
escalated into an insurgency.
	   On Sunday, 350 Lebanese, mostly women and children, arrived in
Beirut also aboard a Nigerian plane. At least 600 Lebanese, many of
them businessmen, were still in Congo.
	   Tens of thousands of Lebanese live in West African countries.
Many of them settled there after fleeing the 1975-90 civil war in
their country and have established successful businesses.

Singapore's July trade figures show economy spiraling down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ In a sign of further weakening in Singapore's
economy, the government announced Thursday that exports of key
products including electronics fell in July.
	   Non-oil domestic exports, a key indicator of overall economic
performance, fell 2.3 percent in July compared to the same period
last year, according to the Ministry of Trade and Industry's Trade
Development Board.
	   The July figures contrasted with an unexpected 6.1 percent
increase in June. Non-oil domestic exports shrank 4.8 percent in
April and 1.7 percent in May.
	   Singapore exports of electronics products, the foundation of the
manufacturing sector, fell 5 percent in July from a year earlier,
following 3.7 percent growth in June, the board said.
	   The July decline in electronics exports reflected a continued
global oversupply of key products, notably hard disk drives,
personal computers and printers, according to the report.
	   Non-oil domestic exports to four of Singapore's top five markets
fell in July from a year earlier, with growth posted only for
shipments to the European Union.
	   Domestic oil exports in July also fell, dropping 18 percent from
a year earlier, after a 22 percent decrease in June, the trade
board reported.

Chinese court rejects corrupt official's appeal

former ... '

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The most senior leader ensnared in a crackdown on
rampant official graft on Thursday lost his appeal against a
16-year prison sentence for his part in China's biggest corruption
scandal.
	   The Supreme People's Court upheld the sentence handed down to
Chen Xitong, a former mayor and Communist Party chief of Beijing,
by a lower court on July 31 after a secret trial, the state-run
Xinhua News Agency said.
	   Appeals are rarely successful in China, and after the Supreme
People's Court decision, Chen has no other chances for redress.
	   A panel of high court judges heard statements from Chen and his
lawyer, questioned the former power broker and reviewed the trial
court's findings before rejecting the appeal, Xinhua said.
	   The high court noted what Xinhua called Chen's ``criminal acts
of corruption'' _ accepting expensive gifts and using public funds
to build luxury villas for his own use.
	   Chen's former colleagues in the Communist Party are believed to
want to make an example of him to demonstrate their determination
to stamp out rampant official corruption that has undermined the
government's legitimacy in the eyes of many Chinese.
	   Chen, 68, was the highest ranked official caught in a
five-year-old government anti-corruption campaign in which hundreds
of thousands of officials have been investigated and many,
including Chen's son, have been jailed.
	   Before his disgrace, Chen was one of 20 members of the Communist
Party's elite Politburo, the apex of Chinese political power. He
was the highest party official to face criminal prosecution since
the notorious Gang of Four were tried for political crimes
following the calamitous 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
	   Chen was brought down in a massive graft scandal that may have
cost Beijing as much as 18.3 billion yuan (more than dlrs 2
billion).
	   Some Chinese dissidents had called for Chen to be executed for
his crimes. Two dissidents who believed Chen got off lightly with a
16-year sentence also launched a signature drive to have him
retried in open, televised proceedings.

Feisty talk show host in stable condition, doctors said
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A feisty talk show host who underwent six hours
of surgery after being attacked with a meat cleaver is in stable
condition and improving rapidly, doctors said Thursday.
	   Doctors said 52-year old Albert Cheng was in ``very stable and
satisfactory condition'' after being assaulted by two unidentified
men armed just before his morning broadcast Wednesday.
	   ``All vital signs are normal, but it will be some time before we
can assess whether his condition will give rise to any degree of
disability,'' said Dr. Yok Chao, chief executive of the Queen
Elizabeth Hospital.
	   Although still in intensive care, Chao said the popular talk
show host known for his scathing commentaries on politics and
government was ``very alert.''
	   Cheng underwent nearly six hours of surgery to reconnect muscle,
bone, and nerve tissue. He sustained six cuts of up to 22
centimeters (nine inches) long, and was given more than five liters
of blood.
	   Despite his liberal and often outrageous attacks on government
and civil servants, condemnation of the assault was widespread and
swift.
	   Speaking before the Australian Chamber of Commerce on Thursday,
Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa said attacks of this kind ``are
unacceptable and will not be tolerated.''
	   The Frontier political movement said that if Cheng was attacked
because of his commentaries, it would be ``a serious danger to Hong
Kong's freedom of news and speech.''
	   ``If a journalist is physically assaulted for performing his
duty ... it symbolizes an attack on the freedom of expression of
the community,'' the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor said in a
statement.
	   Radio Hong Kong reported that police were examining tapes of
past broadcasts in their search for a motive. Officers of the
organized crime bureau have yet to determine whether the
unidentified assailants, both in their 30s, were connected to the
triads, or Chinese gangs.
	   An aviation engineer by training, Hong Kong-born Cheng emigrated
to Canada in 1968, reportedly disillusioned with the Cultural
Revolution taking place on the Chinese mainland. He returned to
Hong Kong in 1984 and launched the first Chinese-language Playboy,
among other magazines.
	   Cheng is especially popular among blue-collar workers, many of
whom enjoy venting their anger at the government on air. Time
Magazine named him one of the most influential people in the
territory last year.

Pakistan plans further belt-tightening to offset hardship of
</HEADLINE>
sanctions &QL; 
 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's
government plans further belt-tightening to revive an economy
stifled by anti-nuclear sanctions and crippled by a dlrs 30 billion
foreign debt, the deputy chief of Pakistan's Planning Commission
said.
	   ``We are in a state of shock .... We have certainly been
affected by these unfair sanctions,'' Ahsan Iqbal said in an
interview Wednesday. Iqbal was recently appointed to run the
commission that charts Pakistan's economic future. Sharif is its
titular head.
	   ``They never considered that we conducted tests for security in
response to India,'' Iqbal said.
	   Pakistan faces sanctions from major world powers including the
United States and Japan for nuclear tests it conducted in May in
response to tests by its archenemy India. India was also punished.
	   The government responded to the sanctions by slapping
restrictions on foreign exchange, devaluing the rupee by around 8.2
percent, increasing fuel prices by 25 percent and cutting spending.
	   ``We were living on borrowed money ... these sanctions could
serve as a wake-up call for us to mobilize resources and get rid of
contradiction in our economy,'' Iqbal said. He said the government
would trim its work force and cut non-salary expenses by 50
percent.
	   Analysts say the government needed to take more painful steps,
including devaluing the rupee further, broadening its tax base and
hiking utility charges.
	   Economic analysts say investors are discouraged by the economic
fallout of the nuclear arms race in South Asia and are unwilling to
increase stakes here. Foreign investors are pulling out and are
unlikely to return for the time being.
	   The Karachi Stock Exchange index plunged to an all time low of
748.03 points on July 10 from around 1,482.48 on May 12 _ a day
before the Indian tests. It is now trading at 971.96.
	   Analysts say the country's economy was in trouble even before
nuclear tests and that sanctions only hastened the slide.
	   ``It's important for Pakistan to break the cycle of crisis. It
hampers long-term investment,'' said Nadim Naqvi, research head of
International Asset Management Company.
	   Iqbal said Pakistan's economy was more vulnerable to sanctions
than India's because it has scant foreign exchange reserves.
	   According to central bank figures Thursday, Pakistan's foreign
reserves stand at dlrs 744 million _ barely enough to pay for three
to four weeks of imports.
	   In yet another blow to the battered economy, the International
Monetary Fund has taken a cue from U.S. sanctions and stalled part
of a dlrs 1.56 billion loan.
	   Iqbal said Pakistan has arranged loans from friendly countries
and institutions. Pakistan has received dlrs 250 million from
Kuwait and more is coming, he said.

Tokyo strives to raise earthquake awareness with real life
</HEADLINE>
simulations &QL; 
 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Residents will camp out in a school gymnasium and
march across central Tokyo in coming days in a city government
campaign started Thursday to prepare the public for a massive
earthquake.
	   This year's annual ``Disaster Prevention Fair'' features
simulation exercises to give residents an idea of what will happen
when the ``big one'' strikes and to raise awareness amid declining
public interest in earthquakes.
	   Experts say a huge temblor in Tokyo would wreak unspeakable
destruction in one of the world's most densely populated areas and
paralyze transportation, stranding millions of people.
	   ``The concept this time is to prepare people to react
appropriately when a real earthquake strikes,'' said Junichi
Kawamura, a fair organizer.
	   About 30 parent-child couples will spend the night huddled in an
elementary gymnasium to simulate evacuation efforts after homes
have been destroyed.
	   Hundreds of people are expected to join a 6 kilometer (3.7 mile)
march through central Tokyo to practice the simple task of getting
home after a quake has buckled roads and jammed the subway system.
	   Why all the fuss this year?
	   ``The memories of the Kobe quake are fading,'' said Nobuyo
Kainuma, a city official. ``Fewer people in Tokyo give importance
to the threat of an earthquake.''
	   The National Land Agency says that 59.6 percent of Japanese
questioned in a 1997 poll said they have a strong interest in
natural disasters, down 7.4 percent from 1995, the year a massive
earthquake killed about 6,000 people in the western Japanese city
of Kobe.
	   Kawamura says that this year's events, which run until Tuesday,
will bring a dose of reality to a fair that in recent has been
dominated by dry seminars and lectures. All in all, about 200,000
people are expected to participate.
	   The annual earthquake fair is a run-up to Japan's Disaster
Prevention Day, commemorating the Great Kanto Earthquake that
struck on Sept. 1, 1923.
	   That quake destroyed the Tokyo metropolitan area and killed more
than 100,000 people. Fires triggered by the tremor left some 1.6
million residents homeless _ roughly 70 percent of population in
the Tokyo area at the time.

Moody's downgrades Toyota
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Moody's Investor Service cut its rating of the
creditworthiness of Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp. on
Thursday, citing concerns about declining sales at home and
elsewhere in Asia.
	   The cut against Japan's largest automaker comes a day after the
U.S.-based credit rating agency downgraded two other Japanese car
companies, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and Nissan Motor Corp.
	   Moody's lowered its assessment of Toyota and its subsidiaries'
ability to repay their debts to ``Aa1.'' Moody's had given Japan's
largest automaker its top rating of ``Aaa.''
	   As the lower credit rating warns of a higher risk for the
companies' lenders, it could raise borrowing costs for the
automaker.
	   Still, the double-A rating remains quite high and allows Toyota
to retain its position as the top-rated Japanese automaker.
	   In explaining its decision, Moody's said the carmaker may see
revenues slip due to falling demand in the struggling economies of
Japan and Southeast Asia, which together account for about half of
Toyota's sales.
	   Recent mergers among major rivals, such as Daimler Benz's
purchase of Chrysler Corp., should also mean stiffer competition,
the agency said.
	   ``Moody's rating action is based on the increasingly competitive
environment in the global auto markets and the weakness in auto
demand throughout Asia,'' it said.
	   Booming exports to the United States and Europe are expected to
pick up only some of the slack, the agency said.
	   The downgrade will affect about dlrs 11.8 billion of the
company's securities, Moody's said.
	   On Wednesday, the credit rating agency lowered its long-term
debt rating for Mitsubishi Motors and Nissan Motor to ``Baa3,'' one
step above ``speculative grade,'' or so-called junk status.

Myanmar military won't convene parliament as deadline looms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ One day before opposition leader Aung San
Suu Kyi's deadline for the military to convene the country's
elected parliament, the military said Thursday it has no intention
of meeting her demand.
	   ``The question is how does one call a parliament if there exists
no constitution,'' said a government spokesman, on condition of
anonymity. ``The demand to convene one sounds like forcing a bald
person to dye his hair.''
	   Suu Kyi and her political party, the National League for
Democracy, issued the call three months ago for the military to
allow parliament to convene by Aug. 21.
	   The 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner spent the day before the
deadline encamped in her van on a bridge 32 kilometers (19 miles)
west of Yangon, the ninth day of her protest against restrictions
on her movements.
	   She was stopped there last Wednesday by authorities as she
attempted for the fourth time in two months to travel to the city
of Bassein to meet members of her party elected to parliament.
	   She refuses to return to Yangon, insisting she be allowed to
travel freely within the country. The government has refused to let
her proceed and ended her last attempt to travel by force.
	   Several ethnic insurgent groups, exiled democracy activists and
Western governments have supported the NLD's call for parliament to
be convened.
	   The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in the assembly in a 1990
election, but the military refused to honor the results. It denied
the election was for a parliament, but instead for delegates to a
convention to write a new constitution.
	   Two years later it convened a constitutional convention but the
NLD had only 15 percent of the delegates. The rest were appointed
by the military.
	   In Nov. 1995, the NLD pulled out of the convention, saying it
was being run undemocratically. The constitution is not complete
and the draft being worked on gives the military the leading role
in politics.
	   It also bars Suu Kyi from holding public office.
	   A commentary in Thursday's state-run New Light of Myanmar called
Suu Kyi a ``traitor using subversive means to disunite the (army)
and people with the aim of gaining state power.''
	   The military has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962.
In 1988, the military gunned down thousands of protesters during a
nationwide democracy uprising.

Peres: massive expansion of Golan settlements is a `provocation'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's decision to build 4,800 new homes in
the Golan Heights and effectively double the Israeli population
there is a ``provocation'' against Syria, former Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres said Thursday.
	   Peres' unusually harsh remarks came a day after a ministerial
committee headed by Cabinet hawk Ariel Sharon approved the
construction of 2,300 homes and 2,500 vacation units in four Golan
settlements.
	   Sharon said the construction was important for strengthening and
developing Israel's Golan settlements. Israel captured the
strategic heights from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed
the area in 1981.
	   Peres, a former key figure in peace negotiations with Syria,
said the decision by the government of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to expand the Golan settlements was ``superfluous,
irritating and unnecessary.''
	   ``Either they (government officials) should stop singing
serenades under Syria's window or they should stop indulging in
provocations,'' Peres told The Associated Press.
	   Earlier this week, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
twice urged Syria to resume peace talks that were suspended in
February 1996. In an interview with a German news magazine,
Mordechai also hinted that his government had softened its position
on a troop withdrawal from the Golan.
	   Syria wants to regain all of the Golan in exchange for signing a
peace treaty with Israel. Syria says that when the talks broke off
in 1996, the Peres government had indicated that the Syrians could
expect to get all of the Golan if they made a full peace agreement.
	   The Syrians insist that the Netanyahu government recognize the
understandings Damascus reached with the previous Israeli
government. Netanyahu has refused to do so and has said continued
control over the Golan is vital for Israel's security.
	   Sharon's spokesman, Raanan Gissin, said the decision to build
more homes in the Golan came in response to public demand. ``Many
people want to live in this beautiful part of the country, and we
are working to fulfill that need,'' Gissin said.

Czechs struggle with legacy of failed communist reforms

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Thirty years after Soviet tanks
smothered the democratic reforms of the ``Prague Spring,'' Czechs
are looking back at the Soviet-led invasion with a mixture of
nostalgia, cynicism _ and silence.
	   On August 21, 1968, five armies of the Soviet-dominated Warsaw
Pact entered Czechoslovakia, kidnapped the country's leaders and
put an abrupt end to nine months of free speech and assembly
unprecedented in the Soviet bloc.
	   About a hundred people were killed in the invasion, and Soviet
military bases sprang up around the country. Hundreds of thousands
fled in fear of political revenge.
	   While many Czechs still remember the painful events, the more
recent 1989 anti-communist revolution seems to have dwarfed the
historical significance of Czech Communist leader Alexander
Dubcek's failed attempt to reform the Marxist system.
	   The country planned no official commemoration of the invasion, a
remarkable decision in itself.
	   ``I remember my parents talking about it. I know it was
terrible, but I never quite understood what really happened,'' said
Miroslav Sehnal, a 33-year-old waiter. ``At any rate, the (1989
anti-communist) revolution was the real thing for me.''
	   Facing international outrage in 1968, Moscow tried to justify
the invasion as ``international assistance'' given to orthodox
Communists defending socialism from Czechoslovak leaders who the
Soviets claimed were bent on destroying, not reforming, the
communist system.
	   Still, most Czechs see the invasion as an act of aggression.
According to a poll by Sofres-Factum that was conducted among 1,085
Czechs in July, only 3 percent approved of it. The local polling
agency provided no margin of error.
	   Despite the consensus, many questions loom for the average
Czech: Did the experiment in communist reform change anything? Was
it worth the suffering?
	   And would it have really been possible to reshape the system had
Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev not crushed the effort so brutally?
	   No one seems to be offering answers.
	   Leading politicians such as Prime Minister Milos Zeman and his
rival, former Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, are largely ignoring the
anniversary, busy focusing on local politics.
	   President Vaclav Havel, once the country's leading
anti-communist dissident, is in the hospital and plans no official
statement, his office said.
	   Yet it was Havel and writer Milan Kundera who clashed over the
importance of the Prague Spring shortly after the invasion.
	   Havel argued that Dubcek's efforts were pointless because the
Communist regime was unreformable. Kundera declared Prague Spring
``a moment of stardom'' for the Czechs.
	   History made Havel the president. Kundera became a best-selling
author exiled in Paris. The two different viewpoints remain.
	   Some say Czechs should have held on to their ideals longer after
the invasion.
	   ``There is a whole range of possibilities between resignation
and military resistance ... we gave up too fast,'' Petr Pithart, a
Communist-turned-dissident who now serves as speaker of the Czech
Senate, told the newspaper Lidove Noviny.
	   Others still say reforming communism was impossible.
	   There is no doubt the 1968 crackdown on reformers is politically
linked to the 1989 revolution, which also paved the way for the
breakup of Czechoslovakia into two countries, the Czech Republic
and Slovakia.
	   Charter 77, a dissident movement that helped bring about the
change, was established by Prague Spring veterans, including Havel.
It focused on human rights rather than politics, bringing together
former Communists, intellectuals as well as Catholic priests.
	   Paradoxically, the greatest praise for Dubcek and his allies
currently comes from Russia, which stifled the reforms.
	   Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader whose perestroika
precipitated the collapse of the Soviet Union, thinks the Prague
Spring was a major turning point.
	   ``It was the beginning of the end of the totalitarian system,''
he recently told Narodna Obroda, a Slovak daily.
	   ``It was also this influence that gave me the courage to start
fundamental change.''

Honda reports record first quarter profit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Honda Motor Co., Japan's third-largest carmaker,
reported Thursday that group profit rose 25.7 percent in the first
quarter of its fiscal year on a stronger dollar and robust sales
overseas.
	   The company said group net income hit a record high 78.22
billion yen (dlrs 547 million) for the three-month period ended
June 30. Sales rose 12.4 percent to 1.6 trillion yen (dlrs 11
billion).
	   ``Sales of automobiles in North America and Europe were
especially good,'' said Kenichi Takashima, a director at Honda.
	   Revenue from Japan and the rest of Asia declined, however, due
to a region-wide economic slump, he said.
	   North American sales surged 26 percent compared to the same
quarter a year ago to 717.13 billion yen (dlrs 5 billion), while
revenue from Japan fell 8.7 percent to 319.80 billion yen (dlrs 2.2
billion).
	   The actual number of Honda automobiles sold in North America
climbed 8.3 percent to 265,000 units. In Japan, Honda sold only
185,000 autos, down 11.9 percent from the previous year.

French foreign minister floats idea of African conference
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, concerned
about instability in Congo, on Thursday proposed holding a ``peace
conference'' involving countries from the Great Lakes region of
central Africa.
	   ``President (Jacques) Chirac had proposed a peace conference
some time ago,'' Vedrine said in an interview with radio station
RTL. ``I think this idea is now more important than ever.''
	   Rebels in Congo _ including former Rwandan allies, ethnic Tutsi
fighters and disaffected members of President Laurent Kabila's own
military _ have captured key towns during a two-week march on the
capital.
	   Defense ministers from Zimbabwe, Zambia, Namibia and Angola have
pledged to help Kabila _ a move that threatens to embroil much of
the regional in Congo's two-week old rebellion.
	   On Wednesday, the rebels offered to negotiate a cease-fire with
the Congo government. There was no immediate indication as to
whether Kabila would agree to talks.
	   In the radio interview, Vedrine described the situation as a
``regional crisis.''
	   ``It's necessary to take into account the strategy of Uganda,
Angola, Burundi, Angola and others,'' Vedrine said. ``These
countries have to re-establish non-conflictual ties and stop
intervening in the affairs of one another.''
	   France, a former colonial power that once ruled over a third of
Africa, also recently proposed an international conference to get
the stalled Middle East peace talks back on track.

Iraq and Syria agree to reopen oil pipeline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq and Syria signed an agreement Thursday
to reopen an oil pipeline for Iraqi petroleum that was closed 16
years ago, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
	   The agreement was signed in Baghdad by Iraqi Oil Minister Amer
Mohammed Rashid and his Syrian counterpart Mohammed Maher Jamal.
	   The two sides agreed to reopen the pipeline that links Iraq's
Kirkuk oil fields to the Mediterranean terminals of Banias in Syria
and Tripoli in Lebanon.
	   They also agreed to continue contacts to boost further
cooperation, INA said.
	   Iraq, which is under sweeping sanctions, has to get U.N.
approval before the pipeline can be opened.
	   Syria closed the pipeline in 1982 in support of Iran during its
eight-year war with Iraq. Jamal's visit is the first by a Syrian
oil minister since relations were cut at the beginning of the
1980-88 war.
	   Jamal told INA that that his visit to Iraq was ``fruitful and
successful.'' He said the two sides built the foundations for
future cooperation in the oil field.
	   The Syrian-Iraqi pipeline has an estimated capacity of 650,000
barrels a day. Rashid has said the pipeline would first pump
300,000 a day on an experimental basis. The two sides also are
discussing opening a second oil pipeline, with a capacity of 1.4
million barrels daily, and an oil refinery.
	   Permission from the United Nations would be required before
either pipeline can be operated. The United Nations imposed
sanctions that prevent free exports of Iraqi oil since 1990 when
Iraq invaded Kuwait.
	   In February, the U.N. Security Council decided to allow Iraq to
increase the value of oil sales under the oil-for-food deal from
dlrs 2 billion within six months to dlrs 5.2 billions. The
oil-for-food deal is an exemption to the U.N. sanctions.

Malaysian prime minister warns nation to avoid riots
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia can surmount its economic
woes if riots are avoided as the government crafts its recovery
plan, the prime minister said Thursday.
	   ``We can overcome this economic crisis if everybody continues to
be calm and there's no rioting,'' Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
told a group of contractors.
	   Rumors of ethnic riots swept through the capital two weeks ago,
which sparked panic buying at supermarkets and forced many to rush
home from work and bolt their doors.
	   Three people have been arrested under the Internal Security Act,
which permits jail without trial, for allegedly circulating riot
rumors on the Internet.
	   Mahathir said last weekend the government may adopt drastic new
measures to prevent further economic deterioration. He warned some
people might be shocked.
	   He reiterated that concern Thursday.
	   ``We hope all parties will support the government's efforts,''
Mahathir said. He added the new measures ``may seem extraordinary
to others, but not to us. Because it is going to save us.''
	   Mahathir stressed that the country's affirmative action policy,
known as the New Economic Policy, would remain in place to promote
racial harmony.
	   The social-economic policy began in the early 1970s to help the
majority ethnic Malay population get a larger share of the economy,
previously dominated by the minority ethnic Chinese. Critics say
the plan fosters cronyism and corruption.
	   ``The distribution of wealth under (the New Economic Policy) has
to be continued, despite the economic problems,'' Mahathir said,
denying the plan promoted cronyism or favored Malays with ties to
government leaders.
	   ``In fact, all Malays are cronies of the government. There is
not a single Malay who has not received benefits under the NEP,''
Mahahtir said.
	   The prime minister also blasted foreign influences, saying he
feared they would take advantage of Malaysia's weakened stock
market.
	   Share prices on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange have shed more
than 75 percent in value since February while Malaysia's currency,
the ringgit, has lost almost 40 percent of its value against the
U.S. dollar since July 1997.
	   The government predicts the economy will contract by up to 2
percent this year, but private economists predict a shrinkage of as
much as 4 percent to 5 percent.

Aquino wants Ver to tell truth about her husband's assassination
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with other charges awaiting Ver in grafs 13-16. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Former President Corazon Aquino said
Thursday a former military chief of staff under late dictator
Ferdinand Marcos should now tell the truth about her husband's
assassination 15 years ago.
	   President Joseph Estrada said on Wednesday he will allow former
Gen. Fabian Ver to return to the Philippines after fleeing the
country with Marcos at the height of the 1986 ``people power''
revolt that toppled the strongman.
	   Estrada said Ver has to face charges in the Aug. 21, 1983
assassination of opposition leader Benigno Aquino Jr., who was shot
moments after he stepped off the plane on his return from exile in
the United States.
	   The assassination triggered massive anti-Marcos protests that
culminated in the revolt that swept Aquino's widow to the
presidency.
	   ``What is more important is for (Ver) to tell us the truth, and
I hope he won't add to the lies in the past,'' Aquino said in a
radio interview.
	   Aquino believes Marcos, who died in Hawaii in 1989, masterminded
her husband's assassination.
	   Marcos denied any role in the murder and said Aquino was killed
by a communist-hired assassin, Rolando Galman, who was shot dead by
soldiers moments after Aquino was gunned down on the Manila airport
tarmac.
	   Estrada, however, said that Ver cannot be forced to identify the
mastermind of the assassination.
	   ``We are in a democracy,'' he said. ``It is his right if he
wants to speak or not. If he does not want to testify, we cannot
force him.''
	   Ver and 25 other soldiers were acquitted of Aquino's murder
three months before Marcos was ousted.
	   After Corazon Aquino took office, the Supreme Court ordered a
new trial, which lasted three years. Sixteen soldiers were
convicted of killing her husband and Galman. But the trial failed
to determine whether Marcos or his associates ordered the
assassinations.
	   Ver, who was accused as an accomplice, was not tried in his
absence and the case against him has been shelved.
	   Meanwhile, victims of human rights abuses under Marcos said they
plan to revive criminal charges against Ver.
	   Ver also is facing charges he amassed ill-gotten wealth during
Marcos' 20-year rule and some of his properties have been seized by
the government.
	   As commander of the presidential security force and the national
intelligence agency, Ver is accountable for the torture, murder and
disappearance of thousands of dissidents, according to Claimants
1081, a group of victims of human rights abuses.
	   ``More than any other military general in the country who served
the late dictator ... it is Ver who should be held liable for all
our sufferings,'' said Rep. Loreta Rosales, who said she was
tortured as a political detainee.

Beauty, personality, computer skills win Singapore contest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ It's a beauty pageant with an information
technology twist.
	   Twelve contestants for Miss Internet Singapore will parade in
business suits and answer Internet trivia questions by typing on
laptops in the pageant finals Saturday night.
	   ``A big portion of the votes _ 30 percent _ comes from the
public,'' said Alex Liu of Metro-Media, the event organizer.
	   From Aug. 1-21, anyone able to log onto the Miss Internet
Singapore web site has had the chance to view pictures of the
finalists, listen to their voices, read about their hopes on their
home pages, and vote for them by sending an e-mail or voice mail.
	   Judges chose the 12 finalists _ aged 15 to 26 _ after
interviewing some of the 620 applicants, who signed up online.
	   Internet knowledge counts for 60 percent of the final points
tally, but the contestants are also judged on how they look in
evening wear and in workout clothes _ leotards, shorts and
sleeveless T-shirts.
	   ``The great thing about this pageant is that it does not test us
strictly on our Internet skills _ it's about beauty as well,''
contestant Stella Tan, 23, a molecular biology student, told a
local newespaper.
	   The subsidiary of a Singapore company sponsored the first Miss
Internet World contest in Trier, Germany last month, said Liu. It
was won by a Singaporean fitness instructor and model, Genevieve
Nathan Edwards, 22, who beat contestants from 14 other countries.
	   Signaporeans already date through the Internet, and use it for
everything from paying taxes to ordering taxis.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq and Syria signed an agreement Thursday
to reopen an oil pipeline for Iraqi petroleum that was closed 16
years ago, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
	   The agreement was signed in Baghdad by Iraqi Oil Minister Amer
Mohammed Rashid and his Syrian counterpart Mohammed Maher Jamal.
	   The two sides agreed to reopen the pipeline that links Iraq's
Kirkuk oil fields to the Mediterranean terminals of Banias in Syria
and Tripoli in Lebanon.
	   They also agreed to continue contacts to boost further
cooperation, INA said.
	   Iraq, which is under sweeping economic sanctions, has to get
U.N. approval before the pipeline can be opened. The United Nations
imposed sanctions after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Syria closed the pipeline in 1982 in support of Iran during its
eight-year war with Iraq. Jamal's visit is the first by a Syrian
oil minister since relations were cut at the beginning of the
1980-88 war.
	   The Syrian-Iraqi pipeline has an estimated capacity of 650,000
barrels a day. Rashid has said the pipeline would first pump
300,000 a day on an experimental basis. The two sides also are
discussing opening a second oil pipeline, with a capacity of 1.4
million barrels daily, and an oil refinery.
	   Permission from the United Nations would be required before
either pipeline can be operated.

	   HAINES JUNCTION, Yukon (AP) _ A minivan collided with a
motorhome on the Alaska Highway in this Canadian territory, killing
five people, including four German tourists, according to
authorities.

the gravel shoulder of the highway, then collided with the oncoming
motorhome, according to a news release from the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police.

Japanese stocks close slightly lower, dollar sinks in Tokyo

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese share prices drifted lower Thursday on
profit-taking following two days of gains, while the U.S. dollar
fell sharply against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 14.93 points,
or 0.10 percent, to close at 15,391.41. On Wednesday, the average
closed up 342.55 points, or 2.27 percent.
	   The retreat came as investors cashed in some of their holdings
after a more than 600-point rise in the main stock index over the
previous two days, traders said.
	   But the decline was stemmed by improved sentiment generated by a
report that the Bank of Japan and government leaders are
considering using taxpayer funds to aid a major bank burdened by
massive bad loans, they said.
	   The Nihon Keizai economic newspaper reported that public money
may be used to smooth a proposed merger between the troubled
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. and Sumitomo Trust and Banking
Corp. Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and a Bank of Japan spokesman
denied the report, however.
	   LTCB shares soared 19 percent to 56 yen (dlrs 0.39).
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 2.04 points, or 0.17
percent, to 1,181.67. The TOPIX closed up 16.99 points, or 1.46
percent, the day before.
	   Declining stocks exceeded advancers 625 to 473, with 159 issues
closing unchanged from Wednesday. An estimated 352 million shares
changed hands on the first section, down from 384.89 million issues
the previous day.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, meanwhile, the dollar
bought 142.55 yen in late afternoon trading, down 1.61 yen from
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate of
143.93 yen overnight.
	   Worry about possible yen-supportive intervention in foreign
exchange markets by monetary authorities kept the dollar under
pressure following a recent rally to eight-year highs against the
yen, dealers said.
	   ``We'd like to be well prepared for intervention,'' said Tatsuya
Ishii, senior sales manager and head of customer foreign exchange
at Banque Nationale de Paris in Tokyo. ``At the moment, the
dollar's downside risk is greater than the upside.''
	   The latest in a series of not-so-veiled warnings came Thursday
from the head of the Japanese Finance Ministry's international
bureau, Haruhiko Kuroda.
	   ``We will intervene appropriately as necessary,'' Kuroda said,
adding that the ministry still views the yen as too weak against
the dollar.
	   On Wednesday, Japan's influential vice finance minister for
international affairs, Eisuke Sakakibara, departed for the United
States where he was expected to meet with Deputy Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers. That led to speculation joint intervention to
bolster the yen may be forthcoming.
	   The dollar sank as low as 142.28 yen in Tokyo trading and
climbed as high as 144.20 yen.
	   In the fixed-income security market, the yield on the benchmark
No. 182 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.190 percent,
down from 1.195 percent on Wednesday. Its price rose to 111.80 yen
from 111.77 yen.

Cambodian authorities seek delay in massive opposition rally

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Setting up a showdown, the Interior
Ministry on Thursday rejected a request by the opposition to stage
a massive weekend demonstration against election fraud, calling for
a one-day postponement.
	   Interior Ministry spokesman Khieu Sopheak said that the
demonstration could not be held Sunday because it is too costly to
pay security forces to work over the weekend ``and they need some
leisure time, too.''
	   Protest organizers said they had not officially been notified of
the decision early Thursday but vowed to go ahead with the rally as
planned Sunday, normally a day off when more people would be able
to demonstrate.
	   ``They have no legal right to prohibit the protest,'' the
opposition Sam Rainsy Party said in a statement.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party and Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC,
the two main opposition groups, began publicizing the event and
were handing out leaflets and driving through Phnom Penh with sound
trucks. They hope to draw at least 10,000 people.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party feared that ``members of the security
forces or other ruling party forces will use threats or violence to
try to stop our members from exercising their legal political
rights.''
	   Strongman Hun Sen's ruling party won a slight majority of 64 of
the 122 parliamentary seats in last month's election, short of the
two-thirds needed to form a new government.
	   FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party _ which together won 58 seats
_ have threatened to boycott the new parliament and block the
formation of a government unless their claims that Hun Sen won by
massive fraud are investigated.
	   The opposition parties have demanded recounts for hundreds of
areas, but the Hun Sen-controlled National Election Committee
dismissed their complaints as ``baseless.''
	   Opposition leader Sam Rainsy said that no international
observers have been keeping watch over election ballots, many of
which are unsecured, since they were brought to Phnom Penh from the
provinces early this month.
	   Sam Rainsy said his own party agents have been prevented from
entering the NEC headquarters where ballots are kept and have been
sleeping outside the building. He said he would join them there
overnight Thursday.
	   The opposition leaders on Thursday wrote French President
Jacques Chirac that many concerns about election fraud still need
to be addressed.
	   ``It is not yet possible to state with certainty what the
Cambodian people wanted to express through the July 26 elections,''
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy wrote.
	   The French president said in an Aug. 13 letter to Cambodian King
Norodom Sihanouk that international observers certified the polls
as free and fair and that all political parties should now work
together to implement the will of the people.

Killy reports to IOC on Tour de France scandals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Jean-Claude Killy reporting on Tour de France
scandals &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Tour de France organizer
Jean-Claude Killy submitted proposals to an emergency IOC meeting
Thursday for dealing with the recent drug scandals which have
rocked the sports world.
	   Australian officials, meanwhile, proposed kicking drug-ridden
sports out of the Olympics, imposing financial penalties on drug
cheats and setting up a special IOC anti-doping agency.
	   Killy, a French IOC member and winner of three gold medals in
alpine skiing at the 1968 Grenoble Olympics, is president of the
company which runs the Tour de France.
	   This summer's race was thrown into turmoil by a series of
arrests and police raids which uncovered systematic use of the
banned endurance-boosting hormone EPO.
	   ``It was bad for sports in general and means we should make
decisions now and take steps that aim to correct the problem of
doping,'' Killy said.
	   The Tour de France scandals prompted International Olympic
Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch to convene Thursday's
special executive board meeting and schedule a worldwide doping
summit in January.
	   Describing the Tour's drug crisis as the catalyst for a new
worldwide anti-doping effort, Killy made a 30-minute presentation
to the closed-door meeting.
	   ``It was important (IOC officials) hear about the Tour de
France,'' he said. ``All of it started during the Tour de France.
They called someone who lived through it for three weeks.''
	   Killy said he made specific propopals to the board for fighting
drug use. Without giving details, he described them as ``very
concrete, very positive, very realistic.''
	   Samaranch fueled controversy recently by stating, in a Spanish
newspaper interview, that the list of banned drugs should be
slashed and only substances which are hazardous to an athlete's
health should be prohibited.

 &UR; Lion dies of heartbreak after mate leaves him for another

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ It may be better to have loved and lost _
than not to have loved at all. But for circus lion Romeo, a love
lost ended in death.
	   When Romeo's mate, Karima, left him for a younger lion at the
National Circus in the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria, the
shock was too overwhelming. He fell into a two-week depression
during which he stopped eating, the daily Al-Ahram reported
Thursday.
	   Efforts by circus veterinarians to bring him out of depression
and eat failed and Romeo died Sunday of a heart attack, the paper
said, quoting circus officials.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Moody's Investor Service cut its rating of the
creditworthiness of Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp. on
Thursday, citing concerns about declining sales at home and
elsewhere in Asia.
	   Moody's lowered its assessment of Toyota and its subsidiaries'
ability to repay their debts to ``Aa1.'' Moody's had given Japan's
largest automaker its top rating of ``Aaa.''
	   As the lower credit rating warns of a higher risk for the
companies' lenders, it could raise borrowing costs for the
automaker.
	   Still, the double-A rating remains quite high and allows Toyota
to retain its position as the top-rated Japanese automaker.
	   In explaining its decision, Moody's said the carmaker may see
revenues slip due to falling demand in the struggling economies of
Japan and Southeast Asia, which together account for about half of
Toyota's sales.
	   Recent mergers among major rivals, such as Daimler Benz's
purchase of Chrysler Corp., should also mean stiffer competition,
the agency said.
	   The cut against Japan's largest automaker comes a day after the
U.S.-based credit rating agency downgraded two other Japanese car
companies, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and Nissan Motor Corp.
	    &UR; _____
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Rising exports and falling imports pushed Japan's
trade surplus with the world 56.8 percent higher in July for the
16th straight month of increase, the government said Thursday.
	   The merchandise trade surplus, a tally of goods exported minus
imports, rose to 1.316 trillion yen (dlrs 9.14 billion) from the
same month last year, the Finance Ministry said.
	   The increase in the surplus _ which is measured as goods pass
customs but before adjustment for seasonal factors _ was slightly
lower than economists had forecast.
	   Japan's politically sensitive surplus with the United States,
meanwhile, continued to climb, rising 59.7 percent to 669.72
billion yen (dlrs 4.7 billion). It was the 22nd straight month of
increase.
	   With the world, exports in July rose 6.6 percent, while imports
fell 5.7 percent. Imports from the United States managed a slim 0.9
percent increase, but were far outpaced by exports from Japan,
which rose 21.5 percent.
	   Exports to the European Union soared 174.5 percent, but
shipments to the crisis hit economies of Asia declined 36.2
percent.
	    &UR; _____
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ In a sign of further weakening in Singapore's
economy, the government announced Thursday that exports of key
products including electronics fell in July.
	   Non-oil domestic exports, a key indicator of overall economic
performance, fell 2.3 percent in July compared to the same period
last year, according to the Ministry of Trade and Industry's Trade
Development Board.
	   The July figures contrasted with an unexpected 6.1 percent
increase in June. Non-oil domestic exports shrank 4.8 percent in
April and 1.7 percent in May.
	   Singapore exports of electronics products, the foundation of the
manufacturing sector, fell 5 percent in July from a year earlier,
following 3.7 percent growth in June, the board said.
	   The July decline in electronics exports reflected a continued
global oversupply of key products, notably hard disk drives,
personal computers and printers, according to the report.
	   Non-oil domestic exports to four of Singapore's top five markets
fell in July from a year earlier, with growth posted only for
shipments to the European Union.
	    &UR; _____
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's commerce minister said
Thursday his ministry will create an independent agency to oversee
exports as a part of the government's economic reform plans.
	   Economists agree that exports are key to Thailand's success in
growing its way out of its year-old financial crisis.
	   Currently, the Commerce Ministry oversees various agencies that
promote and regulate exports. Minister Supachai Panichpakdi, who is
also a deputy prime minister and a key economic advisor to Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai, said the new panel would consist of both
government and private sector appointees.
	   Thailand's exports showed no growth in 1996, as rising labor
costs and inefficient manufacturing processes caused many products
to become uncompetitive.
	   The drop in exports caused many manufacturers to default on
loans, undermining the banking and financial sectors and helping to
precipitate the country's economic crisis.
	   The crisis erupted in full force when Thailand floated its
currency, the baht, in July 1997. It has fallen against the dollar
by about 37 percent.
	    &UR; _____
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Qantas Airways Ltd. has defied the
economic turmoil in Asia to post a record dlrs 182.8 million (304.8
million Australian dollars) net profit for 1997-1998, up 20.6
percent.
	   However, Qantas chairman Gary Pemberton warned Thursday that the
economic situation in Asia will affect future profitability and
said indications are it will be hard to match the record result in
1998-1999.
	   Revenue for Qantas, which has responded to the Asian crisis by
focusing services away from the region, fell slightly to dlrs 4.8
billion (8.13 billion Australian dollars) from dlrs 5.28 billion
(8.8 billion Australian dollars).
	   Pemberton described the result as an excellent achievement in
difficult trading conditions. However, he warned the region would
impact future profitability.
	   Pemberton said the airline's response included the continuation
of planned investment in new product, services and aircraft and
entry into new markets in America and Europe.
	   Qantas chief executive James Strong said net passenger revenue
increased by 3 percent in 1997-1998 and included a favorable impact
of movements in foreign exchange rates.
	    &UR; _____
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Honda Motor Co., Japan's third-largest carmaker,
reported Thursday that group profit rose 25.7 percent in the first
quarter of its fiscal year on a stronger dollar and robust sales
overseas.
	   The company said group net income hit a record high 78.22
billion yen (dlrs 547 million) for the three-month period ended
June 30. Sales rose 12.4 percent to 1.6 trillion yen (dlrs 11
billion).
	   ``Sales of automobiles in North America and Europe were
especially good,'' said Kenichi Takashima, a director at Honda.
	   Revenue from Japan and the rest of Asia declined, however, due
to a region-wide economic slump, he said.
	   North American sales surged 26 percent compared to the same
quarter a year ago to 717.13 billion yen (dlrs 5 billion), while
revenue from Japan fell 8.7 percent to 319.80 billion yen (dlrs 2.2
billion).
	   The actual number of Honda automobiles sold in North America
climbed 8.3 percent to 265,000 units. In Japan, Honda sold only
185,000 autos, down 11.9 percent from the previous year.

Indonesian investigators cast doubt on Internet mass rape pictures
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALI KOTARUMALOS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Investigators probing deadly riots
last May have cast doubt on the authenticity of some graphic
photographs on the Internet showing Muslim men and soldiers raping
Chinese women.
	   Marzuki Darusman, who heads Indonesia's National Commission on
Human Rights as well as a government-ordered inquiry into May's
violence, said Thursday that some pictures could be fakes. None
would not be used as evidence for his inquiry, he said.
	   Women's rights groups have alleged that at least 168 women and
girls, mainly from Indonesia's Chinese minority, were raped during
the riots, in which 1,200 people were killed.
	   Thousands of Chinese-owned homes, stores and buildings were
burned and looted in the violence which led to the resignation of
autocratic President Suharto.
	   Since then explicit pictures purportedly depicting mass rapes
have been posted on a number of Internet websites, helping to
galvanize outrage against Indonesia among ethnic Chinese worldwide.
Anti-Indonesian protests have been held in China, Taiwan, Hong
Kong, the Philippines, the United States and elsewhere.
	   President B.J. Habibie has publicly condemned the alleged rapes
after Beijing demanded that his government bring those responsible
to justice.
	   However, Indonesia's police chief this week complained that his
officers had found no evidence that mass rapes. Some conservative
Islamic groups have also challenged claims that mass rapes were
committed by Muslim men against Chinese women, who are mainly
Christian or Buddhist.
	   Marzuki said his office had viewed many of the photographs on
the Internet. ``We have to careful. It is not impossible that they
are faked,'' he said, adding that his inquiry would rely solely on
the evidence from victims and witnesses.
	   Smita Notosusanto, of a Jakarta women's group against violence,
declined to pass judgement on the photographs.
	   ``We have not and don't want to see such pictures,'' she said.
``We are relying on direct evidence from the victims.''
	   The Asian Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that some of the
disputed photographs originated from an Asian pornographic website
on the Internet.
	   It said others dated back to November last year when they were
originally billed as evidence of torture and human rights abuse by
Indonesian troops in the disputed territory of East Timor.
	   They were denounced as fake at that time.
	   Chinese make up only about four percent of Indonesia's 202
million population. However, they dominate much of the country's
economy and have been made scapegoats for the worst economic crisis
in 30 years.

<TEXT>
	   TOWNSVILLE, Australia (AP) _ American balloonist Steve Fossett
got back to solid ground Thursday, four days after his latest
attempt to fly non-stop around the world ended dramatically when he
crashed into the sea.
	   Standing on the bridge of the New Zealand navy tanker Endeavour,
Fossett smiled and waved to well-wishers and reporters gathered to
greet him.
	   The Endeavour delivered Fossett to shore after a passing yacht
plucked the 54-year-old Chicago millionaire from a lifeboat bobbing
in the Coral Sea in shark-infested waters about 500 miles (800 km)
off Australia's east coast.
	   Fossett had crossed the Australian continent west-to-east and
was on the final leg of his fourth bid to become the first
balloonist to fly non-stop around the world on Monday when a severe
storm ruptured his balloon and forced him down from a height of
almost 29,000 feet (9,000 meters).
	   The adventurer was not injured, but said he thought he was
``going to die'' in the wild hailstorm that disabled his craft, the
Solo Spirit.
	   Fossett was spotted by a French military search and rescue
aircraft on Monday morning. Later that night, the Australian yacht
Atlanta negotiated reefs uncharted since the 1860s to pick him up,
before he was transferred to the Endeavour.
	   Fossett set out from Mendoza, Argentina, on Aug. 7. He traveled
more than 15,200 miles (24,461 kms) _ about two-thirds of the
journey _ breaking his own distance record of 10,360 miles (16,673
km) set in January 1997, before the crash.
	   Fossett's first attempt to circle Earth lasted just 36 hours,
cut short in January 1996 by winter storms.
	   A year later, he set the balloon distance record: a 10,361-mile
(16,673 km), six-day journey from St. Louis, Missouri, to
Sultanpar, India. He landed after running short of fuel while
awaiting Libyan clearance.
	   He took off from St. Louis on his third attempt this past New
Year's Eve. Five days later, Fossett landed 5,802 miles (9,337 km)
away in a wheat field near Krasnodar, southern Russia.

Shares up on futures-related buying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong shares finished moderately higher
Thursday as investors scrambled to cover short positions because of
the market's sharp recent rise largely resulting from government
intervention, analysts said.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 119.95 points, or 1.6
percent, to 7,742.53, after leaping 5.7 percent Wednesday.
	   Propelled by heavy short-covering of blue chips, market volume
swelled to 7.03 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 901.2 million)
from 6.94 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 889.7
million)Wednesday.
	   ``It was mostly futures-led'' buying, said Jerry Pang, equity
salesman at HSBC Securities Asia Ltd.
	   The government has been intervening heavily in the market
recently and was seen propping up blue-chip shares for the fourth
consecutive session Thursday in its effort to fend off speculators
trying to profit in both the currency and stock markets.
	   The Hang Seng Index has jumped 16 percent in the past four
trading days since last Friday.
	   As there are rumors that the government will continue to drive
the index above the 8,000-level, investors short in the futures
market rushed to square their positions Thursday before incurring
further losses, analysts said.
	   ``Most buying in the cash market was genuine buying'' Thursday,
as opposed to government intervention, said HSBC's Pang.
	   Among banking shares, HSBC Holdings gained 3.5 Hong Kong dollars
to 171, and Bank of East Asia gained 0.13 to 8.
	   Among conglomerates, Swire Pacific A gained 1.25 to 23.8, and
Hutchison Whampoa gained 0.9 to 38.9.
	   Property giant Cheung Kong Holdings closed flat at 33.60, and
Sun Hung Kai Properties lost 0.05 to 25.15.

Papua New Guinea clips military's wings on Bougainville
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ The government on Thursday
canceled the army's authority to carry out military operations on
the war-torn island of Bougainville in a move to advance the peace
process.
	   ``The Cabinet met yesterday and made the latest and bold
decision in terms of rescinding the call-out on Bougainville,''
Prime Minister Bill Skate told reporters.
	   A call-out order originally made in 1989 authorized the
deployment of combat troops on Bougainville to support police after
sustained civil unrest on the island. The call-out was renewed in
1996.
	   Rebel leaders on Bougainville have been pushing for an end to
the call-out and are also demanding independence from Papua New
Guinea.
	   Skate said he hoped the decision to end the call-out would help
``achieve peace through peaceful means.''
	   Asked if he expected that an end to the call-out would prompt
Bougainville rebels to disarm, Skate said: ``That's the whole idea.
There must be trust. The Papua New Guinea government is doing its
part and we expect the parties on the other side will also do the
same.''
	   The decade-long civil war on Bougainville ended this year with
the signing of a peace agreement in New Zealand between the
government and Bougainville rebels.
	   The Special State Negotiator for Bougainville, Sir John Kaputin,
said the agreement called for the government to consider rescinding
the decision on the call-out.
	   He said the decision to end the call-out did not signal ``the
departure of the state or in any way the constitutional
responsibility for the administration of that part of the
country.''
	   Kaputin said the government adhered to its position of no
independence for Bougainville but it would consider greater
autonomy for the island.

Canadian appointed to chair talks on nuclear-weapons material
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Disarmament negotiators Thursday appointed a
Canadian chairman to head talks on a treaty banning the production
of material used to make nuclear weapons.
	   Canadian Ambassador Mark Moher was approved by consensus at the
61-nation Conference on Disarmament to chair the committee
discussing so-called ``fissile materials,'' plutonium and highly
enriched uranium.
	   The forum last week agreed to set up the talks after Israel, the
last remaining holdout, agreed to join in, although with
reservations.
	   ``Anyone who doubted the courage of the (conference) should not
doubt any more,'' Moher told delegates.
	   Under international pressure following their test explosions
earlier this year, neighbors Pakistan and India both said they were
ready to engage in negotiations.
	   Talks are likely to progress slowly, with conference members
divided on whether they should aim to ban future production of
nuclear-weapons material or also address existing stockpiles.
	   Pakistan says negotiations should deal with India's stocks.
Others, including China and France, believe the treaty should only
address future production.
	   The U.S. representative, Ambassador Robert Grey, last week
predicted ``a long and tedious negotiation'' of between two and
five years.
	   Action on fissile material is referred to by arms negotiators as
the ``cut off'' treaty because it would stop the production of
nuclear weapons.
	   The Geneva conference is the world's main multilateral
disarmament body. Past successes include treaties to ban chemical
weapons and to halt test explosions of nuclear bombs.

Hong Kong's chief executive defends market intervention
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TARA SUILEN DUFFY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Amid warnings that Asia's turmoil may undermine
the world economy, the chief executive on Thursday defended
government intervention to fight what he said were efforts by
speculators to manipulate Hong Kong's markets.
	   Speaking to the Australian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong,
Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa said his territory faces further
shrinkage of the economy and growth in unemployment in the near
future.
	   The main Hang Seng stock index plummeted early this month, and
the government blamed speculators for betting on a further decline
and driving prices still lower.
	   On Friday, it announced that it bought shares in order to fight
the speculators. This week reports said Malaysia followed suit,
indicating Hong Kong's approach may spread.
	   Countering widespread criticism, Tung said the move was purely
defensive and did not signal a change in Hong Kong's policy of not
interfering in the markets.
	   ``We are not out there to support the stock market at any
level,'' he said. However, he added that the government had to act
when speculators drove up interest rates. Higher interest rates are
a further drag on the economy.
	   Although the government has not indicated this week that it
bought any more shares, traders said it has been in the market.
Before last Friday, the Hang Seng had lost 60 percent of its value
since its peak last August.
	   As of midday Thursday, however, the Hang Seng Index had gained
about 16 percent back because of government purchases and resulting
moves by speculators to cover their short positions.
	   Short covering refers to investors buying shares they borrowed
and sold, betting they could buy them back at a lower price and
pocket the difference.
	   Analysts put the government's investment in the market since
Friday at around 5 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 640 million) to
as high as 7.7 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 1 billion).
	   Several bankers supported the intervention, but other bankers,
investors, and politicians have accused the government of
contradicting its non-intervention policy and damaging the market's
credibility and public confidence.
	   In a commentary in the Asian Wall Street Journal on Thursday,
Hong Kong Monetary Authority chief executive Joseph Yam defended
the move, saying speculative activity threatened to undermine Hong
Kong's economy.
	   ``Governments have a role in protecting the level of income and
employment of their people,'' he said.
	   Tung and Yam said intervention was necessary to prevent the
Asian crisis from spreading to other emerging markets and
ultimately to Group of Seven economies.
	   ``I think there is now a need to get a message to the G-7 that
abstaining from intervention to maintain global financial
stability, particularly currency stability, may no longer be a
viable option,'' Yam said.

New bankruptcy court opens its doors in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The first commercial court set up
under Indonesia's new bankruptcy law opened its doors Thursday as
Indonesia grapples with its worst economic crisis in decades.
	   The new law took effect Thursday by means of a presidential
decree, an official at the state secretariat said. However, it
still had to be transcribed into national law books, he said.
	   Justice Minister Muladi officially opened the new commercial
court at the central Jakarta district court building.
	   He said another four courts would open soon in Ujung Pandang in
south Sulawesi, Medan in north Sumatra, Sumarang in central Java
and Surabaya in east Java.
	   ``There haven't been any cases filed yet,'' said I Gde Ketut
Sukarata, who was installed as the head of a team of 17 judges.
	   ``It will take about two weeks for the court to start
operations,'' Ketut said.
	   A working bankruptcy law is seen as crucial for foreign and
domestic banks to clear up the overhang of unpaid debt that
continues to drag on the economy.
	   Under a previous bankruptcy law that dated back to Dutch
colonial times early this century, there was little creditors could
do to banks which couldn't or would't pay debts.
	   The successful implementation of the law is expected to lead to
a deluge of cases.

Clashes leave 20 rebels dead in Sri Lanka, officials say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Government forces pounded Tamil
guerrillas with artillery and mortars in northeastern Sri Lanka,
killing at least 20 guerrillas and losing five of their own men,
the defense ministry said Thursday.
	   In Trincomalee, 230 kilometers (140 miles) northeast of Colombo,
government soldiers ambushed and killed 10 fighters of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam on Wednesday, the defense ministry
said in a statement. Two government soldiers were killed in the
clash, it said.
	   In Batticaloa, 110 kilometers (70 miles) south of Trincomalee,
another battle took place when advancing soldiers fought off a
guerrilla counterattack. Eight rebels and three soldiers were
killed, the statement said.
	   Two more rebels died Wednesday when they attacked a government
post near the town of Mankulam, 250 kilometers (155 miles) north of
the capital, Colombo. Mankulam is the biggest town along a highway
the army has been trying to capture since May of last year.
	   Troops need the road to establish a land link to the former
rebel stronghold of Jaffna, whose half million people now rely on
air and sea deliveries of food and other supplies. Soldiers have
cleared nearly two-thirds of the road but still have another 27
kilometers (17 miles) to go.
	   In another incident, a policeman sitting in a shop was shot and
killed by rebels in Mannar, 220 kilometers (135 miles) north of
Colombo.
	   Militants among Sri Lanka's 3.3 million Tamils have been
fighting since 1983 for a separate homeland. They accuse the
country's majority Sinhalese of widespread discrimination against
Tamils. More than 54,000 people have been killed in the fighting.

Lion dies of heartbreak after mate leaves him for another

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ It may be better to have loved and lost _
than not to have loved at all. But for circus lion Romeo, a love
lost ended in death.
	   When Romeo's mate, Karima, left him for a younger lion at the

shock was too overwhelming. He fell into a two-week depression
during which he stopped eating, the daily Al-Ahram reported

Tel Aviv beaches closed after sewer main breaks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ All Tel Aviv beaches were ordered closed
Thursday after a main waste pipeline broke and 7 million cubic feet
(200,000 cubic meters) of sewage spilled into the Mediterranean.
	   Despite red flags and warning signs posted at life guard
stations, dozens of people entered the water. Some tourists said
they had gone swimming because they couldn't read the Hebrew signs.
	   Beaches in the Red Sea resort of Eilat were shut down for
several days earlier this week following a major sewage spill.
	   ``This is a bad week for us. It started in Eilat and has now
spread to Tel Aviv,'' Nehama Ronen, the Environment Ministry's
general manager, told Israel radio.
	   Two other Mediterranean beaches in Israel are permanently closed
due to sewage dumping by municipalities.

Singapore prime minister sets deadline for opposition leader to
</HEADLINE>
apologize
 &UR; Eds: UPGRADES attribution with comment from prime minister's
lawyers, ADDS details; TRIMS &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has offered to
waive damages from a defamation suit against opposition leader
Joshua Jeyaretnam if the veteran politician issues an acceptable
apology by Friday.
	   Goh will forgive 100,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 57,000) in
damages, but not the court costs of about 150,000 Singapore dollars
(dlrs 86,000), his lawyers said in a statement Thursday.
	   A Singapore court ruled last year that Jeyaretnam had defamed
Goh at a Dec. 31 1996 election rally when he stated that one of his
fellow candidates had filed a police report against the prime
minister for criminal conspiracy and lying.
	   Those facts were accurate, but the lower court ruled they
contained defamatory innuendo. The Court of Appeal added that they
were said in malice, and increased the damages to Goh by five
times.
	   ``Jeyaretnam does not want to apologize in terms of the Court of
Appeal ruling,'' Goh's lawyers said. They were not more specific.
The lower court had found Jeyaretnam guilty only of ``acting
recklessly.''
	   The opposition Worker's Party leader said Thursday that he has
``offered to apologize ... sincerely and unreservedly for the hurt
caused ... and thanking him for his act of statesmanship'' in
waiving the damages.
	   Jeyaretnam is one of three opposition members in the 84-seat
Parliament, which has been dominated by the People's Action Party
since independence in 1965. He has said he is unable to pay the
damages or court costs, unless by installment, and stands to lose
his seat if he is declared a bankrupt.
	   Goh's lawyers said he was willing to accept installment
payments.

Killy reports to IOC on Tour de France scandals

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new 7th graf with date of summit meeting set for
Feb. 2-3 &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Tour de France organizer
Jean-Claude Killy submitted proposals to an emergency IOC meeting
Thursday for dealing with the recent drug scandals which have
rocked the sports world.
	   Australian officials, meanwhile, proposed kicking drug-ridden
sports out of the Olympics, imposing financial penalties on drug
cheats and setting up a special IOC anti-doping agency.
	   Killy, a French IOC member and winner of three gold medals in
alpine skiing at the 1968 Grenoble Olympics, is president of the
company which runs the Tour de France.
	   This summer's race was thrown into turmoil by a series of
arrests and police raids which uncovered systematic use of the
banned endurance-boosting hormone EPO.
	   ``It was bad for sports in general and means we should make
decisions now and take steps that aim to correct the problem of
doping,'' Killy said.
	   The Tour de France scandals prompted International Olympic
Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch to convene Thursday's
special executive board meeting and schedule a worldwide doping
summit for early next year.
	   The IOC announced Thursday that the summit, originally planned
for January, would be held Feb. 2-3 in Lausanne and that more than
500 delegates were expected to attend.

World Bank official rejects claims that corruption took 20 percent
</HEADLINE>
of loans

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The World Bank's director in Indonesia
on Thursday rejected allegations that 20 percent of money earmarked
for bank projects in the country had been siphoned off
fraudulently.
	   The Wall Street Journal reported this week that Indonesian
officials were believed to have taken more than 20 percent of
project money, citing a World Bank internal memorandum detailing
large-scale corruption.
	   The bank's Indonesian director, Dennis de Tray, said the extent
of corruption had never been quantified.
	   ``I don't deny the problems'' of corruption, de Tray said after
meeting senior Indonesian economics minister Ginandjar
Kartasasmita.
	   ``The 20 percent figure is anecdotal. I don't know where the
(Wall Street Journal) report gets the figure,'' he added. ``There
has never been any systematic research on that.''
	   The memorandum quoted by the newspaper was written in August
1997 for senior bank officials.
	   It reportedly points to an entrenched culture of corruption,
which contributed to Indonesia's severe economic problems and the
political unrest that forced President Suharto to step down in May.
	   The analysis, prepared by World Bank staff in Indonesia, appears
to reflect the bank's awakening last year to Indonesia's endemic
corruption, but bank officials have claimed they were ignorant of
the problems until only recently.
	   Long present in Indonesia, the World Bank has been sharply
criticized for not blowing the whistle on the country's crisis
sooner and for even adding to it by tolerating corruption in its
Indonesia projects.
	   Earlier, Ginandjar said that the government asked the World Bank
last year to investigate allegations of corruption in its projects.

World Cup in Britain in 2000

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Great Britain will host the 2000 rugby
league World Cup and Australia will host the 2002 tournament,
officials said Thursday.
	   Members of 10 rugby league nations finished a two-day meeting
here Thursday after launching the new governing body, the Rugby
League International Federation.
	   Chairman John McDonald also announced a tri-series tournament
involving Australia, Great Britain and New Zealand to start in
October-November next year.
	   Australian tours to Great Britain will return following the
Super League split while the annual matches between the winning
club sides from Australia's National Rugby League and Great
Britain's Super League competitions will also resume.
	   ``We are trying to rebuild the international calendar and every
country has been enthusiastic in finding the best way to do so,''
McDonald said. ``We are looking at a two-year cycle for the first
two World Cups so we can return this level of competition to both
hemispheres as soon as possible.''
	   He said the World Cup would then likely be played every four
years.
	   McDonald said 10 percent of funds raised from international
matches would go to developing league nations represented at the
meeting, plus France.

Former East German swimming coaches fined in doping trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Two former East German coaches on trial for doping
were let off with fines Thursday after confessing that they
systematically gave performance-boosting drugs to female swimmers.
	   The Berlin state court ruled that Bernd Christochowitz, 40, and
Klaus Klemenz, 55, bore limited guilt in the effort, which
prosecutors said was part of the former communist country's
state-sponsored drive for Olympic medals.
	   Verdicts against three other defendants _ two doctors and
another coach _ were expected later Thursday.
	   At the trial's opening Tuesday, the defendants admitted
administering the drugs but all five denied that they knowingly
damaged the health of the athletes. Some were as young as 12 when
they started taking the pink and blue anabolic steroid pills.
	   The court ordered Christochowitz to pay a 7,500 mark (dlrs
4,200) fine; Klemenz was fined 3,000 marks (dlrs 1,670).
	   One of the doctors, Ulrich Suender, testified Tuesday he knew
little about possible side effects of steroids, and had thought
they were reversible.
	   Suender and the others were charged with causing bodily harm to
as many as 17 young female swimmers on East Germany's TSC Berlin
team from 1978 to 1989.
	   One is now sterile because her hormonal balance was disrupted by
the steroids, which she started taking at 13. Others suffered such
side-effects as deeper voices, serious acne and excessive hair
growth.
	   Prosecutors say the defendants administered the drugs without
telling the minors or their parents what they were taking.
	   However, Christochowitz, who now works for an insurance firm,
insisted he didn't know the pills were anabolic steroids.
	   The trial is Germany's second attempt to bring former East
German sports officials to account after evidence of the doping
program emerged from communist files after German unification.
	   The first trial, which began March 18, involves coaches and
doctors from the former showcase swim team Dynamo Berlin.

Mexicans debate death penalty after capture of kidnap king
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK STEVENSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico has long condemned the U.S. death
penalty, but calls for restoring executions here have echoed on
talk shows, street corners and in the halls of congress since the
capture of an alleged kidnapper and murderer.
	   The debate was sparked by Monday's capture of Daniel Arizmendi
Lopez, who police say cut off his victim's ears and sent them to
relatives, killed at least two hostages and raped another.
	   ``I'm going to send you a foot or a hand ... I'm going to eat
him,'' a voice identified as Arizmendi's was heard saying in the
tape of a ransom call to a victim's family. The tape was broadcast
on local television stations Wednesday.
	   Arizmendi himself has said he would rather be executed than
spend his life in prison. He was caught about 10 days after
allegedly executing a kidnap victim _ the last of what he
acknowledges were 21 kidnappings. In that last case, Arizmendi
reportedly continued to demand ransom even after the victim was
dead.
	   ``The army should shoot him (Arizmendi) and all his accomplices.
We shouldn't spend taxpayer money to keep him alive in prison,''
caller Oscar Gonzalez Sanchez told the Formato 21 radio station
Wednesday.
	   It is a strange position for Mexico to be in: the government has
traditionally refused to extradite fugitives who would face the
death penalty and in the past Mexicans have angrily protested U.S.
executions of Mexican citizens, 34 of whom remain on death row in
U.S. prisons.
	   Many Mexicans still oppose the death penalty.
	   ``I think that the terms applicable under our laws, which cannot
exceed 50 years in prison, are more than sufficient,'' said Mariano
Palacios Alcocer, president of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party.
	   Mexican criminal codes specify maximum sentences of between 40
and 50 years for most serious crimes. Despite predictions that
Arizmendi might get sentences totaling 200 years because of his
combined charges, legal experts say no convict can serve more than
50 years in prison.
	   But Interior Secretary Francisco Labastida, who oversees
domestic security issues, said Wednesday he is in favor of a public
debate on the death penalty. Congressional leaders from both the
ruling party and opposition groups echoed the call.
	   ``I am absolutely convinced that we have to make our punishments
more severe,'' Labastida said.
	   The Mexican constitution allows the death penalty for ``traitors
in foreign wars, the murder of a parent, first-degree murder,
arson, kidnapping, highway robbery, piracy and serious offenses in
the military.''
	   The death penalty cannot be applied, however, because it is not
included in any state or federal codes. It still exists as a
theoretical possibility in military courts.
	   The head of Mexico City's Human Rights Commission, Luis de la
Barrera, said that in Arizmendi's case, the death penalty might be
irrelevant.
	   ``He despised the lives of his victims ... and he has no regard
for the value of his own life,'' he said.

Myanmar military won't convene parliament as deadline looms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Suu Kyi offering to end protest

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi offered
Thursday to end her road side standoff with the military government
if the government agrees to release jailed members of her political
party.
	   Suu Kyi's health was also ``failing'' according to a statement
released Thursday by the National League for Democracy, her
political party.
	   Citing her personal physicians, who have visited her twice in
her van outside Yangon, her eyes are turning yellow and she has low
blood pressure, the party statement said.
	   Her doctors took blood samples, fearing she may have contracted
jaundice or another disease after spending nine days in her car
with three colleagues 32 kilometers (19 miles) outside Yangon.
	   Suu Kyi is engaged in her fourth confrontation in two months
with the military government over her right to travel freely within
Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   She was stopped outside Yangon last Wednesday by the authorities
as she attempted to drive to the city of Bassein to meet with
members of parliament from her party.
	   The NLD said the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner was willing to
return to Yangon if the government released jailed members of
parliament and other members of her party imprisoned since May.
	   There are 42 NLD members of parliament in Myanmar's prisons,
according to the All Burma Students Democratic Front, an exile
group.
	   The number of NLD members arrested since May is unclear, as Suu
Kyi has said in the past that when people are arrested in far flung
provinces the party sometimes doesn't hear about it.
	   There was no immediate response from the military government to
Suu Kyi's demand. In the past, they have never met her calls to
release political prisoners or begin a dialogue.
	   Suu Kyi's offer to end her protest comes one day before her
party's deadline for the military to convene parliament.
	   The military said Thursday it has no intention of meeting the
demand.
	   ``The question is how does one call a parliament if there exists
no constitution,'' said a government spokesman, on condition of
anonymity. ``The demand to convene one sounds like forcing a bald
person to dye his hair.''
	   Several ethnic insurgent groups, exiled democracy activists and
Western governments have supported the NLD's call for parliament to
be convened.
	   The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in the assembly in a 1990
election, but the military refused to honor the results. After the
NLD victory, it denied the election was for a parliament, but
instead for delegates to a convention to write a new constitution.
	   The constitution is not complete and the draft being worked on
gives the military the leading role in politics and bars Suu Kyi
from holding public office.
	   The military has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962.
In 1988, the military gunned down thousands of protesters during a
nationwide democracy uprising.

Thailand-based rights group condemn abuses in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thailand-based human-rights group
Thursday condemned Indonesia's repression of democracy movements
and said the government must be held accountable.
	   In a statement commemorating the 53rd anniversary of Indonesia
independence, Forum-Asia said that military leaders and politicians
from the regime of former President Suharto still remain in power.
	   ``The Indonesian government, particularly the military, instead
of protecting the rights of the Indonesian people, have become the
perpetrators of violations and abuse that have brought immeasurable
suffering to the Indonesian people,'' a press statement said.
	   Forum-Asia said that the Indonesian government has for several
decades abducted, tortured, raped, murdered and employed social and
economic restrictions to persecute the people of East Timor, Aceh,
and West Papua, also known as Irian Jaya.
	   The government of new President B.J. Habibie was called on to
limit the role of the armed forces to national security and restore
a ``genuine sense of security'' by addressing human rights
violations and releasing all political prisoners.
	   The group called on the government to remove the military from
policy-making role in the parliament and guarantee free expression,
association and assembly.
	   Suharto resigned in May after the country's worst economic
crisis in decades triggered riots and protests against his regime.

Thai AM/PM stores to sell stake to U.S. franchiser Arco
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai franchisee for the AM/PM
convenience store chain plans to sell at least a 5 percent interest
in its operations to Arco, the U.S.-based gas station operator and
franchiser for the stores, a newspaper report said Thursday.
	   A bank is now conducting a due diligence investigation of AM/PM
(Thailand) as Arco negotiates its equity purchase, the Thai
company's chief executive officer, Thanes Chokesikarin, was quoted
as saying by The Nation daily.
	   He said the due diligence procedure would be completed by the
end of the month.
	   Thanes was quoted as saying that the franchise currently has 270
stores in Thailand and plans to have more than 350 by the end of
the year, with 200 more stores to be added annually.
	   Its main competitor, 7-11, recently opened its 1,001st outlet in
Thailand.
	   Thanes said the Thai stores could benefit from Arco's expertise.
He said there are plans to offer more services in Thai AM/PM
stores, including Internet access, video rentals and off-site
ticket sales.
	   Arco, part of the Atlantic Richfield oil company, operates about
1,600 gas stations in the United States as well as the AM/PM chain.

England bat first in the final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England won the toss and decided to bat first in
the one-day triangular series final against Sri Lanka at Lord's
Thursday.
	   England made one change to the team which lost to South Africa
on Tuesday, bringing in the experienced Mike Atherton to open with
Nick Knight, while world champions Sri Lanka replaced Chandika
Hathurusingha with leg-spinner Upul Chandana.
	   All-rounder Adam Hollioake made way for Atherton.
	   England and Sri Lanka qualified for the final with a positive
run-rate while South Africa, the third team in the tournament,
missed out despite beating England in the final league match.
	   All three teams finished with a win each.
	   So far, the teams batting first have won the three matches in
the three-way series, and skipper Alec Stewart had no hesitation in
batting first after winning the toss.
	   The inclusion of Chandana strengthened Sri Lanka's spin attack,
that also includes off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan, off-cutter
Kumara Dharmasena and left-arm spinner Sanath Jayasuriya.
	   Alistair Brown, who opened for England in the first two games,
will bat in down the order to bolster a middle-order which has
collapsed in both preliminary games.
	   In the first match at Lord's England lost 7-24 in six overs
against Sri Lanka before winning by 36 runs. England lost 8-69
against South Africa at Edgbaston, when it lost by 14 runs.
	   Teams:
	   Sri Lanka: Sanath Jayasuriya, Romesh Kaluwitharana, Marvan
Atapattu, Aravinda de Silva, Arjuna Ranatunga (captain), Hashan
Tillakaratne, Upul Chandana, Kumara Dharmasena, Pramodaya
Wickramasinghe, Muttiah Muralidharan and Suresh Perera.
	   England: Alistair Brown, Nick Knight, Alec Stewart (captain),

Prime Minister: devaluation, debt restructuring needed to stave off
</HEADLINE>
default &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's devaluation of the ruble and suspension
of debt payments was a last-ditch effort to avoid a full default,
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said.
	   ``If we were to continue servicing our debt and making payments
on treasury bills we would be unable to pay wages and pensions,''
Kiriyenko said in remarks broadcast by Russian television.
	   Russia's financial crisis deepened this month as stocks fell
sharply and investors fled Russian bonds en masse even though rates
soared to 200 percent.
	   The Central Bank acknowledged Thursday that Russia's hard
currency reserves fell sharply in the days before the devaluation
was announced, falling nearly dlrs 2 billion last week _ from dlrs
17 billion as of Aug. 7 to dlrs 15.1 billion last Friday.
	   The government has continually failed to pay wages and pensions
to millions of Russians, sparking social protests in several
regions of Russia, including a sporadic coal miners' blockade of
the Trans-Siberian railway.
	   Kiriyenko said the suspension of payments on treasury bills
would add between 200 and 250 billion rubles (dlrs 29 and 36
billion) to state coffers over the next 18 months that would help
pay back wages.
	   Unpaid wages grew by 6.5 percent in July and stood at 75.8
billion rubles (around dlrs 11 billion) as of the beginning of this
month, but only 20 percent of that is owed by the state.
	   The government had initially planned to announce the terms of
debt restructuring on Wednesday but postponed it until Monday under
pressure from foreign investors who feared that Russia was going to
offer them a worse deal than Russian banks.
	   Kiriyenko said the government was now talking to foreign
investors trying to find a compromise. ``We're not going to refuse
to return this money to them, but act together to calmly and
thoroughly analyze the real opportunities we have,'' he said in a
speech before the Cabinet.
	   The ruble's value remained virtually unchanged Thursday at the
Moscow currency exchange controlled by the Central Bank which
serves to set the official exchange rate. It fell to 6.995 Thursday
in comparison with 6.99 the previous day.
	   The government has decided to allow the ruble to sink as low as
9.5 to the dollar, but is hoping that it will shortly stabilize at
around 7. Most bankers share this forecast and street rates for
selling dollars, which plunged to 9.5 and below earlier this week,
has stabilized around 7.5 to 8 at booths around Moscow on Thursday.
	   A longer-term forecast would strongly depend on the government's
stabilization efforts and the position of Russian commercial banks,
many of which are now in trouble because of over-dependence on
ruble assets.
	   The government on Thursday also discussed next year's draft
budget which is now being recalculated.
	   Kiriyenko said the government would proceed from the most
pessimistic scenario, assuming that the world prices for oil and
natural gas _ Russia's main exports _ would remain low and the
continuing financial crisis would make it hard for the government
to find new loans.

First Salvador Dali exhibition opens in post-communist Poland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WROCLAW, Poland (AP) _ The black, 10-meter (33-foot) moustache
hanging from the town hall can mean only one thing _ an exhibition
of graphics by Spanish surrealist Salvador Dali opened Thursday.
	   It is the first exhibition of Dali's work in post-communist
Poland. During the decades of Soviet-dominated communist rule, the
government banned Dali's art as a sign of the decay and excess of
capitalist culture.
	   Dali, who died in 1989, created the almost 400 graphics from
1935-78 to illustrate literary classics such as Dante Alighieri's
``Divine Comedy'' and Lewis Carroll's ``Alice in Wonderland.''
	   The graphics come from the collection of Heinz Ess of Germany,
whose father was a doctor and Dali's neighbor. Dali paid for his
medical care with the graphics.
	   The exhibition in Wroclaw, about 250 kilometers (150 miles)
southwest of Warsaw, runs through Oct. 10.

Diplomats: Congo rebels captured key town before talks offer

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ A rebel offer to talk peace with President
Laurent Kabila came, western diplomats said Thursday, after the
opposition force secured control of a key western town that is the
last major obstacle before the capital of Kinshasa.
	   Political leaders in the rebel movement made the surprise offer
Wednesday to negotiate a cease-fire with the government, although
fighting was reported coming from the area around Mbanza-Ngungu,
about 150 kilometers (95 miles) south of the capital, a western
diplomat said on condition of anonymity.
	   ``The negotiation offer has not stopped the fighting,'' the
diplomat said.
	   Two other ministry level officials also confirmed that the
rebels were in Mbanza-Ngungu and that fighting near that city was
continuing.
	   In a sudden shift in tone, the political wing of the rebel
movement _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsi fighters, Rwandan soldiers
and disaffected members of the Kabila's military _ said talks were
possible if the government acknowledged this was a domestic
problem.
	   ``We believe the solution to this problem is a political
solution,'' said Bizima Karaha, Kabila's former foreign minister
who fled to join the rebellion.
	   The government, however, says the rebels are simply pawns in a
Rwandan military move to dominate the region.
	   Kabila has throughout insisted neighboring Rwanda orchestrated
the revolt with the support of Uganda _ a charge both countries
deny.
	   ``We will not negotiate with the instruments of Rwanda and
Uganda,'' Information Minister Didier Mumengi said in Kinshasa,
adding he believed Kabila would only agree to talk directly with
Rwanda and Uganda.
	   The government in recent days has been emboldened by a pledge
from several of its southern neighbors to back Kabila. Zimbabwe
says it will provide troops for Congo's war effort.
	   Zambia, Namibia and Angola also have offered support to Kabila,
but in no specific terms.
	   In Ethiopia, the Organization of African Unity also said it
backed Kabila and urged the rebels to lay down their weapons.
	   The rebels' played their negotiation card after two weeks of
rapid military advances in which they captured most key towns in
eastern Congo and the west.
	   They control a key corridor from the Atlantic coastline to
Mbanza-Ngungu, almost 300 kilometers (185 miles) inland.
	   In Kinshasa, state-controlled Voice of the People radio made no
mention of the rebel offer.
	   On Thursday, the capital awoke again with power, which was cut
off earlier this week by rebels who control the town of Inga, the
location of the main power dam that supplies Kinshasa.
	   Kabila, who remains in the southern city of Lubumbashi, has
accused Uganda and Rwanda of sending troops, tanks and supplies to
aid the rebels. The two countries helped Kabila oust former
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko 15 months ago.
	   ``Another column of Uganda troops and tanks has entered
Congolese territory,'' Information Minister Mumengi said on
state-television.
	   Both countries to the east and northeast of Congo have become
disillusioned with Kabila's inability to bring stability to
Congolese territory along their common border. Although they deny
backing the rebels, Uganda and Rwanda are widely believed to be
giving them support.
	   The rebels, in making their offer of peace, said they would
welcome mediation from a third country.

Austrian World War I cemetery restored in western Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A memorial cemetery for Austrian soldiers
who died in World War I has been restored in a western Ukrainian
village, a newspaper said Thursday.
	   Most of the former imperial soldiers died in a hospital near
Tsenzhiv, a village close to the area where major battles were
fought between Austria and Russia in World War I. Over the years,
the cemetery where they were buried became neglected and overgrown
with weeds, Kievskiye Vedomosti said.
	   The cemetery was now restored with the help of the Austrian
memorial Black Cross group, and local residents including
schoolchildren have pledged to take care of it, the paper said.

Iraq rejects Butler's request to allow resumption of inspections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Thursday turned down a request by
the chief U.N. weapons inspector to resume cooperation with his
teams, saying the arms monitors were receiving orders from
Washington.
	   Richard Butler sent a letter to Baghdad on Wednesday asking Iraq
to allow the resumption of weapons inspections that Iraq suspended
on Aug.5
	   Iraq's Deputy Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz said Iraq will not
allow the resumption of inspections by United Nations Special
Commission as long as it was dictated by the United States.
	   ``Butler and some elements in the Special Commission are not
international employees but serve the American policies to maintain
the sanctions on Iraq by following its orders,'' Aziz said in a
statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency.
	   ``The decision (to suspend inspections) is final and will not be
changed until the Security Council seriously, responsibly and
fairly looks into Iraq's demands without American pressures,'' Aziz
said.

Estrada: Philippines to temporarily depend on U.S., neighbors for
</HEADLINE>
defense &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo Available &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines will have to depend
on its defense ties to the United States and regional security
arrangements until it can develop a credible military, President
Joseph Estrada said Thursday.
	   The country also must strengthen its economy to be able to buy
weapons for defense, Estrada said in an address to graduates of the
National Defense College.
	   ``In the financial crisis gripping Asia today, our security
hinges on the state of our economy,'' Estrada said.
	   Estrada said the military can also help in economic recovery by
taking on civilian tasks and by helping pursue peace talks with
Muslim and Communist rebels.
	   ``I firmly believe that until we develop a credible military
deterrent, we must depend on the goodwill of our neighbors, on our
treaty commitments with the United States, and on the skills of our
diplomats in making everyone know that we in the Philippines want
only peace, stability and shared prosperity,'' he said.
	   Military ties with the United States have remained a sensitive
issue since a nationalist Philippine Senate forced the closure of
the last U.S. base in the country in 1992, ending close to a
century of American military presence in its former colony.
	   The United States halted all joint exercises in the Philippines
and visits by U.S. military ships in December 1996, when the Manila
government ended a legal loophole that had shielded U.S. military
personnel from prosecution by the Philippines for crimes committed
here.
	   A Visiting Forces Agreement, signed in February this year by
U.S. and Philippine officials, would provide legal protections to
U.S. soldiers while on duty in the Philippines.
	   Critics say the accord limits the Philippine government's right
to prosecute American soldiers who commit crimes in the country. It
generally gives the United States jurisdiction over soldiers who
commit crimes while on duty, and the Philippines jurisdiction over
crimes committed while off-duty.
	   The agreement must be ratified by the Philippine Senate, which
has not yet begun deliberations.
	   Members of the socialist group, Pandayan, rallied at the U.S.
Embassy Thursday and questioned whether the agreement would also
benefit the Philippines.
	   ``How can we believe that the agreement is 'mutually beneficial'
... when Mr. Clinton admitted having lied to the rest of the world
about his extramarital affairs?'' the group said in a statement.
	   Many of the demonstrators chanted, ``Liar, Liar.''

Health failing, Suu Kyi offers to end protest if prisoners freed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Suu Kyi said to be in high spirits,
2nd graf; RESTORES background, last four grafs

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi offered
Thursday to end her roadside standoff with the military regime if
the government agrees to free jailed members of her political
party.
	   Suu Kyi's health was ``failing'' nine days into the standoff but
she was in ``high spirits,'' according to a statement released by
the National League for Democracy, her political party.
	   The offer came on the eve of the Friday deadline set by Suu Kyi
for the government to finally convene a parliament elected in 1990
but never allowed to meet, part of her renewed campaign against the
government.
	   Citing her personal physicians, who have visited Suu Kyi, 53,
twice in her van 32 kilometers (19 miles) outside Yangon, her eyes
are turning yellow and she has low blood pressure, the statement
said.
	   Doctors took blood samples, fearing she may have contracted
jaundice or another disease after spending nine days in the van
with three colleagues on a small country bridge.
	   Suu Kyi is engaged in her fourth confrontation in two months
with the military government over her right to travel freely within
Myanmar, also known as Burma. She was stopped last Wednesday as she
attempted to drive to the city of Bassein to meet members of
parliament from her party.
	   The NLD said the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner was willing to
return to Yangon if the government released jailed members of
parliament and other members of her party imprisoned since May.
	   There are 42 NLD members of parliament in Myanmar's prisons,
according to the All Burma Students Democratic Front, an exile
group.
	   The number of NLD members arrested since May is unclear. Suu Kyi
has said in the past that when people are arrested in far-flung
provinces, the party sometimes doesn't hear about it.
	   There was no immediate response from the government to Suu Kyi's
demand. In the past, they have never met her calls to release
political prisoners or begin a dialogue.
	   Suu Kyi's offer to end her protest comes one day before her
party's deadline for the government to convene the parliament. The
military said Thursday it has no intention of meeting the demand.
	   ``The question is how does one call a parliament if there exists
no constitution,'' a government spokesman, on condition of
anonymity, said in a faxed statement. ``The demand to convene one
sounds like forcing a bald person to dye his hair.''
	   Several ethnic insurgent groups, exiled democracy activists and
Western governments have supported the NLD's call.
	   The party won 82 percent of the seats in the assembly in a 1990
election, but the military refused to honor the results.
	   After the NLD victory, it denied the election was for a
parliament, but instead for delegates to a convention to write a
new constitution.
	   Two years later, the government called a constitutional
convention but the NLD had only 15 percent of the delegates. The
rest were appointed by the military. In November 1995, the NLD
pulled out of the convention.
	   The constitution is not complete and the draft being worked on
gives the military the leading role in politics. It also bars Suu
Kyi, daughter of independence hero Aung San, from holding office.
	   The military has ruled Myanmar since 1962. In 1988, the military
gunned down thousands of protesters during a nationwide uprising.

Ukrainian village hospital loses its only ambulance _ a horse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ It was a low-cost if old-fashioned
solution. And it worked _ for a while.
	   A cash-strapped hospital in southern Ukraine decided to combat
the mounting costs of gas and auto parts buying a
horse-and-carriage, a newspaper said Thursday.
	   The carriage was used by medics in the Nova Mayachka settlement
of Kherson region as an ambulance of sorts and also served them for
house calls, said the daily Kievskiye Vedomosti.
	   Unfortunately, the plan came to an abrupt end when a thief made
off with the horse, Kievskiye Vedomosti said. And the hospital's
financial woes haven't improved; the paper said they are unable to
find the 200 hryvna (about dlrs 100) to buy another horse.

Chinese border police capture 660 would-be illegal migrants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police on China's southeastern coast have stopped
660 people from emigrating illegally this year, the official Xinhua
News Agency reported Thursday.
	   Police captured the would-be migrants by foiling 60 attempted
trips out of Fujian province, a notorious center for illegal
migration from China, Xinhua said.
	   Chinese anxious for better lives abroad are known to pay up to
tens of thousands of dollars to organized criminal gangs to smuggle
them to Japan, the United States and other countries. Once
overseas, many are forced to work in sweatshop factories and
restaurants to pay off debts to the gangs.
	   Fifty-nine ``snakeheads,'' as the human smugglers are known,
have also been arrested in this year's province-wide crackdown on
the business, Xinhua said.
	   To end the illegal migration, police have set up networks of
informants and intensified checks in a dozen counties known to be
centers of the trade, Xinhua said.

	   Iraq's Deputy Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz said Iraq will not
allow the resumption of inspections by United Nations Special
Commission as long as it was dictated by the United States.
	   The U.N. inspectors must certify that Baghdad has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the Security Council will lift sanctions imposed in 1990
after Baghdad invaded Kuwait, touching off the Gulf war.
	   Iraq claims it has complied with U.N. resolutions.
	   ``Butler and some elements in the Special Commission are not
international employees but serve the American policies to maintain
the sanctions on Iraq by following its orders,'' Aziz said in a
statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency.
	   ``The decision (to suspend inspections) is final and will not be
changed until the Security Council seriously, responsibly and
fairly looks into Iraq's demands without American pressures,'' Aziz
said.

	   Butler's letter to Aziz came after the Security Council earlier
this week gave him only general backing and not the clear
instructions he had sought in the face of Baghdad's decision.
	   Baghdad announced Aug. 5 that it was ceasing cooperation with
the United Nations because Butler refused to certify that Iraq had
destroyed its banned weapons.
	   The United Nations sent similar, non-threatening messages to
Baghdad recently, with the Security Council's only muted response
that Iraq's decision to stop working with U.N. inspectors was
``totally unacceptable.''
	   The letter comes as the U.N. chief's envoy, Prakash Shah was on
his way back to New York after failing to persuade Iraq to resume
cooperation with inspectors. Shah was tentatively scheduled to
brief the council on Monday.
	   U.N. inspectors must be accompanied by Iraqi escorts when they
carry out inspections.
	   The Council was to conduct a regular review of sanctions on
Thursday, but there was widespread consensus that no movement was
expected because of the standoff and continued questions about
Iraq's weapons capabilities.
	   Iraq claims it has complied with U.N. resolutions and says the
United States is manipulating inspections to maintain sanctions.
	   The inspectors must certify that Baghdad has eliminated all its
weapons of mass destruction before the sanctions can be lifted. The
sanctions were imposed following Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

Malaysia reacts angrily to Australian criticism
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ As one newspaper put in bold on
Thursday, Australia's top Commonwealth Games official was a ``pain
from down under.''
	   Perry Crosswhite, general manager of Australian's Commonwealth
Games Association, may want to stay away from Kuala Lumpur, given
how much hostility he has provoked.
	   On Wednesday, he warned Australian athletes to expect
difficulties during next month's games because some of the
Malaysian organizers were former military officers.
	   ``I think if we judge it in respect of Western standards we are
going to have to be very careful about that because we're used to
running sports events of this magnitude and they are not,''
Crosswhite said.
	   ``I take strong exception,'' said Hashim Mohd. Ali, the
Malaysian chief of the 1998 organizing committee.
	   Hashim said he had dashed off a letter to the Australian
Commonwealth Games Association protesting the comments.
	   ``The Aussie is just an insecure redneck anxious to look
sophisticated and worldly-wise,'' said Thursday's Malay Mail.
``Friendly, yet so insular and parochial like their pinup girl of
the moment -- Pauline Hanson.''
	   Hanson is a right-wing, anti-Asian immigrant member of the
Australian Parliament.
	   Crosswhite said Wednesday that Malaysia may have difficulty
coping with some specific sport issues as some of the games
officials are former military officers.
	   ``Things are going to happen and it will go wrong,'' Crosswhite
said.
	   Hashim is a retired army general and many of the other sports
managers are former military officers.
	   Hashim said Malaysia would find it difficult to be a good host
if visitors came in biased.
	   ``If they come with a mind-set that things will go wrong, then
it will become very difficult to look after them,'' he told a news
conference.
	   But he said he wanted to wait for a response from the Australian
sports managers before commenting further.
	   ``If he comes and apologizes, I will accept that and say let us
enjoy the games.''
	   Malaysia has launched a national campaign to make the
Commonwealth Games a success. Despite a crushing economic crisis,
the government has built enormous stadiums, refurbished the capital
and spent billions on equipment.
	   But nagging concerns have remained about incomplete games
facilities and the ability of personnel to manage the first
Commonwealth Games held in Asia.
	   On Thursday, Hashim said his only concern was the weather. ``It
would be a shame if the opening ceremony is washed out,'' he said.
	   The 10-day games begin September 11. September is a month when
it usually rains almost daily.
	   More than 6,000 athletes and sports officials are expected to
participate in the games, ranked second only to the Olympics in
importance.

Outgoing prime minister defends his record, new Cabinet to step in

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Outgoing Prime Minister Abdul-Salam Majali
defended his record Thursday, hours before the expected
announcement of Jordan's new Cabinet.
	   Crown Prince Hassan, is scheduled to swear in the government of
Prime Minister-designate Fayez Tarawneh later Thursday. The prince
is deputizing for King Hussein who is in hospital in the United
States.
	   Palace officials said the new government would be dominated by
liberal technocrats, including some members of the previous
Cabinet.
	   Majali resigned late Wednesday after the king received a report
on an investigation into the pollution of drinking water in the
capital, Amman. The report, compiled by a committee appointed by
the king, has not been released to the public.
	   Speaking to reporters as he left his office, Majali said: ``My
resignation has no relation to either the water problem or the
growth rate reports.''
	   The government had also been accused of misleading the public by
stating that the economy grew by 4 percent in 1997. The World Bank
said the rate did not exceed 0.8 percent.
	   ``I am happily satisfied with my performance and my government
concurs,'' Majali said. He was leaving because ``this period needs
new endeavor and new policies.''
	   However, outgoing Interior Minister Natheer Rasheed indirectly
admitted that the resignation was prompted by discontent with
government policy and the water scandal.
	   ``Each government faces crises and those get resolved when new
faces take over,'' Rasheed said.
	   From his hospital bed on Wednesday night, the king, who is being
treated for cancer, appointed Tarawneh, 50, a close confidant, to
run the new administration.
	   Like Majali, Tarawneh is an ardent supporter of King Hussein's
policy of peace with Israel. He negotiated the 1994 treaty with
Israel and is a former ambassador to the United States.

Iraq rejects Butler's request to allow resumption of inspections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Thursday turned down a request by
the chief U.N. weapons inspector to resume cooperation with his
teams, saying the arms monitors were receiving orders from
Washington.
	   Richard Butler sent a letter to Baghdad on Wednesday asking Iraq
to allow the resumption of weapons inspections that Iraq suspended
on Aug. 5.
	   Iraq's Deputy Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz said Iraq will not
allow the resumption of inspections by United Nations Special
Commission as long as it was dictated by the United States.
	   The U.N. inspectors must certify that Baghdad has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the Security Council will lift sanctions imposed in 1990
after Baghdad invaded Kuwait, touching off the Gulf war.
	   Iraq claims it has complied with U.N. resolutions.
	   ``Butler and some elements in the Special Commission are not
international employees but serve the American policies to maintain
the sanctions on Iraq by following its orders,'' Aziz said in a
statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency.
	   ``The decision (to suspend inspections) is final and will not be
changed until the Security Council seriously, responsibly and
fairly looks into Iraq's demands without American pressures,'' Aziz
said.
	   Butler's letter to Aziz came after the Security Council earlier
this week gave him only general backing instead of the clear
instructions he had sought in the face of Baghdad's decision.
	   Baghdad announced that it was ceasing cooperation with the
United Nations because Butler refused to certify that Iraq had
destroyed its banned weapons.
	   The United Nations has sent similar, non-threatening messages to
Baghdad recently, with the Security Council's only muted response
that Iraq's decision to stop working with U.N. inspectors was
``totally unacceptable.''
	   Washington has also toned down its reaction and U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright has acknowledged she advised inspectors
against some surprise inspections for fear that a confrontation
would further split the divided council.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, has said repeatedly that
his country won't reverse its decision unless the council makes
swift movement toward lifting the sanctions.
	   The letter comes as the U.N. chief Kofi Annan's special envoy,
Prakash Shah was on his way back to New York after failing to
persuade Iraq to resume cooperation with inspectors. Shah was
tentatively scheduled to brief the council on Monday.
	   U.N. inspectors must be accompanied by Iraqi escorts when they

Japan to give dlrs 1.4 million worth of medical goods to Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan will provide hospitals in the Russian Far
East with humanitarian aid consisting of medical equipment and
medicine worth about 200 million yen (dlrs 1.4 million), the
foreign ministry said Thursday.
	   The aid include anesthetizing equipment, supersonic wave
diagnostic devices, antibiotics and other medicines, said a
ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The official said the goods will be delivered to eight hospitals
between late August and September.
	   Japan has been providing such medical aid to the Russian Far
East since 1992 as the areas are far from the central Russia and
medical goods are in short supply, the official said.
	   She said Japan has supplied a total of dlrs 85 million worth of
medical equipment to the area so far.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Kenyans suffering both physical and
emotional wounds gathered at an ecumenical memorial service
Thursday for the 247 people who died in the bombing of the U.S.
Embassy in Nairobi.
	   President Daniel arap Moi and U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell
were expected to address the mourners, who met at downtown Uhuru
Park for the open-air service.
	   While investigations into the twin attacks on U.S. Embassies in
Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, continued on several fronts, a
band of Islamic extremists warned of further strikes against
American interests.
	   FBI Director Louis Freeh toured the site of the bombed U.S.
Embassy in Dar es Salaam on Thursday and met with Tanzanian
officials and FBI agents handling the investigation there.
	   Two people remained in custody in Tanzania in connection with
the investigation, but Home Affairs Minister Ali Ameir Mohammed
would not give their names or nationalities.
	   ``We haven't made any conclusions that anybody being held here
is connected at this point to the bombing,'' Freeh told reporters.
	   FBI agent Kenneth Piernick, who heads the U.S. side of the
Tanzanian probe, said ``similarities of events'' strongly suggested
a link between the two bombings.
	   In Nairobi, FBI agents returned Wednesday to take pictures of a
hotel in a seedy downtown section a mile (half-kilometer) from the
U.S. embassy. The hotel had been the scene of an FBI and Kenyan
detective raid the day before.
	   And in Pakistan, two more people were being questioned Wednesday
in the Aug. 7 bombings, which together killed 257 people and
wounded more than 5,500. The pair reportedly were named by a
suspect with alleged links to exiled Saudi millionaire Osama bin
Laden, whom U.S. officials call a major sponsor of terrorism.
	   U.S. officials were rebuffed Wednesday in their efforts to get
to bin Laden, who lives in Afghanistan. The Taliban religious army,
which rules most of Afghanistan, said it would not hand him over
even if the United States had proof he was behind the bombings.
	   However, The New York Times on Thursday quoted Taliban spokesman
Wakil Ahmed Mutawakil as saying if the United States presented hard
evidence of bin Laden's involvement in the bombings, the Taliban
would ``talk to the U.S.'' about what to do about him.
	   A group reportedly founded by bin Laden _ the World Islamic
Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders _ issued a defiant
warning Wednesday in the respected London-based Arabic newspaper
al-Hayat.
	   ``The coming days will guarantee, God willing, that America will
face a black fate,'' the statement said. ``Strikes will continue
from everywhere, and Islamic groups will appear one after the other
to fight American interests.''
	   Al-Hayat said that statement was accompanied by others from the
Islamic Army for the Liberation of Holy Shrines, which claimed
responsibility for the embassy bombings.
	   The Daily Nation, a Kenyan newspaper, reported that the FBI and
the Kenyan agents raided the Hilltop Hotel based on information
provided by Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, who was arrested in Pakistan on
the day of the bombings and returned Aug. 14 to Kenyan authorities.
	   In Pakistan, a border official said a Saudi and a Sudanese were
being questioned about the bombings after being detained Saturday
at the Afghan border. The New York Times reported that Odeh had
identified the two men as accomplices.
	   The Daily Nation said a bomb containing 1,760 pounds (800 kilos)
of TNT was assembled over several days at the hotel under Odeh's
direction.
	   It said two hotel rooms where the bomb was made were occupied
from Aug. 3-6 by four foreigners _ two Palestinians, an Egyptian
and a Saudi. It said the bomb was built there until Aug. 6, when it
was taken away in a small truck and completed elsewhere.
	   The paper also said police were holding three other people in
connection with the attack.
	   In Islamabad, Pakistan, The News newspaper reported Wednesday
that Odeh gave a detailed account of worldwide anti-American
operations by a secretive Muslim guerrilla group based in
Afghanistan. The 34-year-old engineer said the group was led by bin
Laden, The News reported.
	   In Afghanistan, Foreign Minister Mullah Mohammed Hasan said he
was convinced bin Laden had nothing to do with the embassy
bombings, but if proven otherwise, bin Laden would be punished in
Afghanistan. ``It is not right to give a Muslim to an infidel
country,'' he said.
	   U.S. and Albanian agents, meanwhile, began a nationwide search
for suspected terrorists who may have been planning to blow up the
American Embassy in the Albanian capital of Tirana. Heavily armed
Marines guarded the American diplomatic compound in Tirana on
Wednesday.
	   The search began after the CIA uncovered ``serious evidence'' of
a bombing plot last week, according to an Albanian official at the
Interior Ministry who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Alaskan researchers team with Western science to probe environment

	   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) _ Harry Brower recalls the days when he'd
help his mother render seal blubber into edible oil, stirring the
liquid until fat dropped to the bottom of the bucket.
	   These days, the 40-year-old Inupiat Eskimo hunter says, rendered
seal blubber doesn't sink. ``It used to in the past and I'm not
sure what the cause of that is,'' said Brower, a fish and game
researcher in Barrow, the United States' most northern community on
the Arctic Ocean.
	   That change and other unexplained oddities such as hairless
seals and lesions on fish have left researchers curious and a bit
worried. Could whale meat, berries and seals _ the foods
traditionally eaten by native Alaskans _ be contaminated?
	   To answer that question, Western researchers might have
descended on Alaska to conduct their high-tech tests on the
environment and the population in a virtual vacuum.
	   But in a unique program announced Tuesday, researchers will
combine knowledge gathered by native Alaskan communities with
Western science as they delve into the long-term effects of the
state's pollution.
	   Armed with a three-year, dlrs 700,000 grant from the
Environmental Protection Agency, the Alaska Native Science
Commission will stress traditional knowledge. Native Alaskans will
be equal partners in the research.
	   The project _ which relies on traditional ``talking circles'' to
gather information from native hunters, fishermen and cooks _ will
unite villagers' observations with Western science in a
first-of-its-kind examination of subsistence foods statewide.
	   ``The commission wants to hear what people have noticed,'' said
Mary Killorin, a research associate director with the Institute for
Social Economic Research at the University of Alaska in Anchorage.
	   While subsistence food quality was a focus of research following
the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, studies then were mostly
limited to traditional foods consumed by native Alaskans from the
polluted regions of Prince William Sound, where nearly 11 million
gallons (42 million liters) of oil fouled the environment.
	   This time, the commission's scope is much broader. Field
hearings are scheduled to start Sept. 30 in Nome, a hub city in
northwest Alaska, followed by investigations over the next year at
Sitka, Fort Yukon, Bethel and the Aleutian Islands.
	   Sessions will be patterned after a traditional talking circle,
the native version of a town meeting.
	   The hunting and gathering ways of native Alaskans _ Tlingits,
Haida and Tsimshian in the southeast, Eskimo along the north and
west coasts, Aleuts of the Aleutian Islands and Athabascan through
the interior _ will be asked their views.
	   Killorin said villagers have testified at ``zillions'' of
hearings over the years about unexplained oddities such as hairless
seals, darkened burbot fish livers and off-tasting Labrador tea
leaves, used to treat everything from arthritis to upset stomach.
	   ``We have heard about lesions on fish, changes in the wind,
changes in the air quality,'' Killorin said.
	   Northwest Alaska natives for years have complained about
increasing cancer rates that some say may be linked to the 1986
Chernobyl nuclear reactor explosion in Ukraine or radiation
generated by U.S. military projects in Alaska.
	   No direct link has ever been established.
	   David Norton, a staff scientist with the Barrow Arctic Science
Consortium, said Alaska's traditional foods generally are pure
despite airborne and land-based pollutants that may creep northward
from industrialized regions.
	   However, contaminants have been detected in parts of Russia and
extreme northeast regions of Greenland, Norton said.
	   ``We're very concerned that southern sources of pollution may be
accumulating in the Arctic,'' he said. ``We want to start studying
now.''
	   Combining Western and native approaches in scientific studies
requires patience, but it pays off, and not only in knowledge
gained, Norton said. ``What comes out of it is a lot of mutual
respect.''

Eight more funerals as Northern Ireland struggles to heal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout with last funerals, Sands-McKevitt refused U.S.
visa, latest casualty figures
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The shattered town of Omagh was
burying the final eight civilians slain by a terrorist car bomb as
medical staff dealt Thursday with more than 300 survivors bearing
physical and mental scars.
	   Twenty-eight people died in Saturday's blast in the religiously
mixed town 70 miles (110 kms) west of Belfast, the most deadly
attack in the three decades of Northern Ireland's conflict. The
Irish Republican Army dissident gang responsible, the so-called
``Real IRA,'' is facing a security crackdown on both sides of the
Irish border.
	   Meanwhile, it emerged that the political activist most closely
identified with the faction, Bernadette Sands-McKevitt, had her
U.S. visa application refused by the State Department after she
visited the Dublin embassy last week.
	   Sands-McKevitt, sister of the IRA hunger-strike leader Bobby
Sands and common-law wife of the Real IRA's reputed commander, met
members of Congress during her previous American lobbying trip to
oppose April's peace deal that allows Protestants and Catholics to
share power in Northern Ireland.
	   She denies that her legal pressure group, called the 32 County
Sovereignty Committee, supports the Real IRA. But she had hoped to
travel to New York and Washington to criticize an accord she argues
will ensure continued violence because it did not bring about the
end of Northern Ireland as a Protestant-majority state linked with
Britain.
	   Among those being buried Thursday were Deborah Cartwright, 20,
daughter of a police officer, at St. Columba's Anglican church in
Omagh; Esther Gibson, 36, a Sunday school teacher in Ian Paisley's
hard-line Free Presbyterian Church; and Elizabeth Rush, 54, whose
shop beside the Kosy Corner pub was leveled in the blast.
	   Also being laid to rest were Geraldine Breslin, 43, a Catholic,
and Protestant Ann McCombe, 49. The pair were good friends and
colleagues at Watterson's fabric shop who, like so many others, had
been evacuated towards the car bomb because of misleading phone
warnings.
	   Sixteen victims were buried Wednesday, including three boys aged
8 to 12 in the neighboring Irish Republic, and four others Tuesday,
including a 12-year-old Spanish exchange student and his teacher in
Madrid.
	   Medical officials, initially overwhelmed by the massive tide of
seriously wounded to Omagh's County Tyrone Hospital, confirmed that
more than 330 people were wounded in the blast, not the previous
estimate of 220.
	   The most grievously wounded were flown by helicopter to
hospitals in Belfast and Londonderry, Northern Ireland's
second-largest city. Seventy-six people _ including 14 children _
remained hospitalized Thursday, including seven in critical
condition, among them two children.
	   At Londonderry's Altnagelvin hospital, medical director Ray
Fulton said many patients were only starting to emerge from
sedation and semiconsciousness to find out about the disaster.
	   ``It's now dawning on them, so there is a big outpouring of
grief,'' Dr. Fulton said. ``A lot of the staff are finding it very
difficult to cope with these patients, but they are coping very
well.''
	   Some mental-health nurses doing emergency duty at County Tyrone
Hospital said they might need counseling too. ``Nothing could have
prepared me for what I saw,'' said Thomas McFarland.
	   ``People were lying on the floor with limbs missing and there
was blood all over the place. People were crying for help and
looking for something to kill the pain.''
	   ``You could not really be trained for what you had seen unless
you were trained in Vietnam or somewhere like that,'' he said.
	   Fellow nurse, Marian Skeath, said she faced the ''awful
decision'' of what to do with a dead woman while her relatives
watched.
	   ``She had to be taken off the trolley she was on and put on the
floor because someone else now needed the trolley,'' she said.
	   ''Her son said, `Anywhere but on the floor,' so we made her a
makeshift stretcher of four small chairs.''
	   ''I will never forget the look on her family's faces.''

Top Portuguese athlete's coach says she was anemic in Budapest race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Top Portuguese athlete Fernanda Ribeiro
was suffering from anemia in Wednesday's European Championship
10,000-meters race but refused to take a prescribed medicine which
also enhances the performance of athletes, according to news
reports Thursday.
	   On Aug. 7, doctors diagnosed the former women's Olympic and
world champion as suffering from anemia, a condition in which there
is a shortfall in the number of red blood cells, resulting in
weakness, Ribeiro's coach was quoted as saying by sports paper
Record.
	   Doctors prescribed EPO, a synthetic hormone that stimulates the
production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells and is suspected of
being used by some athletes to improve performance. There is no
reliable way of detecting the use of EPO.
	   Ribeiro's second place in the 10,000 meters, behind Ireland's
Sonia O'Sullivan, was the main upset in Wednesday's events in
Budapest.
	   The anemia condition had forced the Portuguese champion to drop
out of the Osaka meeting in May.
	   ``She was so weak (Wednesday) that I never even thought she'd
win a medal,'' Ribeiro's coach Joao Campos told Record.
	   Campos alleged that other athletes are taking EPO and urged the
introduction of blood tests at track meets.
	   ``I'm sure that doping is going on. It's time we pulled our
heads out of the sand and admitted that there is EPO in
athletics,'' he was quoted as saying.

Cricketers will face dope tests at Commonwealth Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Cricketers will not be exempted
from drug tests at next month's Commonwealth Games because all
participants are governed by the same rules, the chief organizer
said Thursday.
	   ``The Commonwealth Games Federation stand is that there cannot
be any exception,'' said Hashim Mohd. Ali, the chief organizer of
the 1998 games, which will include cricket for the first time.
	   Indian cricket managers have protested drug tests for
cricketers, saying nowhere in the world do players undergo such
scrutiny. Indian cricketers won't appear for tests, the Indian
cricket board said this week.
	   Hashim said he had not received a letter from the Board of
Control for Cricket in India, but if he does, he would just forward
it to the CGF in London, which lays down rules for the games.
	   But he did not seem to think it was worth the fuss. ``If you are
innocent, then why do you worry,'' he said.
	   Tests to determine whether a sports person is taking
performance-enhancing drugs will be carried out at random and a
cricketer could very likely be included, he said. But not everyone
would have to undergo the test.
	   The 10-day Commonwealth Games begin Sept. 11, but the cricket
matches start two days earlier.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets ended mixed Thursday, with
a firmer Japanese currency continued to boost some markets, while
others fell slightly on profit-taking from recent market rallies.
In Japan, worry about possible intervention to support the yen in
foreign exchange markets kept the U.S. dollar under pressure,
following a recent rally to eight-year highs against the yen,
dealers said. In late trading in Tokyo, the dollar bought 142.55
yen in late afternoon trading, down 1.61 yen from late Wednesday in
Tokyo. The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shedding 14.93
points, or 0.10 percent, to close at 15,391.41, after gaining more
than 600 point in the previous two days. In Seoul, share prices
were sharply up, with the key Kospi index soaring 4.9 percent to
316.59 points on the Japanese yen's gain and rising hopes of a
peaceful resolution of the ongoing labor strife at Hyundai Motor
Co. In Hong Kong, the government was seen propping up blue-chip
shares again to fend off speculators in both the currency and stock
markets. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's devaluation of the ruble and suspension
of debt payments was a last-ditch effort to avoid a full default,
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said. ``If we were to continue
servicing our debt and making payments on treasury bills we would
be unable to pay wages and pensions,'' Kiriyenko said in remarks
broadcast by Russian television. Russia's financial crisis deepened
this month as stocks fell sharply and investors fled Russian bonds
en masse even though rates soared to 200 percent. The Central Bank
acknowledged Thursday that Russia's hard currency reserves fell
sharply in the days before the devaluation was announced, falling
nearly dlrs 2 billion last week _ from dlrs 17 billion as of Aug. 7
to dlrs 15.1 billion last Friday. The government has continually
failed to pay wages and pensions to millions of Russians, sparking
social protests in several regions of Russia, including a sporadic
coal miners' blockade of the Trans-Siberian railway.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Thousands of pre-World War II insurance policies
bought by victims of the Nazis will be honored in a dlrs 100
million settlement by Italian insurer Assicurazioni Generali, the
first of several insurers challenged over unpaid policies. The
agreement announced Wednesday still must be approved in U.S.
federal court and by the company's board of directors in a process
that could last six months. It would settle a lawsuit filed by
survivors against Generali and other insurers in Italy, Germany,
France and Switzerland, claiming policyholders were never paid.
``This is an immense achievement, a triumph of justice,'' said Elan
Steinberg, director of the World Jewish Congress. He, Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, and the lead plaintiff, Marta Cornell Drucker, said they
hope the deal prods other major European insurance companies into
paying on more than dlrs 1 billion in policies held by Jews killed
in Nazi death camps. (US-HOLOCAUST-CLAIMS)
	   ULSAN, South Korea (AP) _ South Korean government mediators
reported some progress Thursday in ongoing negotiations to end a
month-long strike at Hyundai Motor Co., the nation's largest
automaker. Kim Kwang-shik, head of the Hyundai union, one of South
Korea's most militant, said, ``It's rough sailing, but the talks
have not broken down yet.'' The creation of a more flexible labor
market was a key part of reforms South Korea promised last December
in return for a dlrs 58 billion bailout package from the
International Monetary Fund. Hyundai is the first major South
Korean conglomerate to begin eliminating jobs. The outcome will
likely affect other troubled businesses and South Korea's overall
efforts to woo back foreign investors. The government has 15,000
riot police standing by to break up the strike if the negotiations
fail. Some 5,000 workers and their families have been encamped
since July 20 inside Hyundai's plant at Ulsan, 280 kilometers (175
miles) southeast of Seoul. (SKOREA-HYUNDAI)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Moody's Investor Service cut its rating of the
creditworthiness of Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp. on
Thursday, citing concerns about declining sales at home and
elsewhere in Asia. The cut against Japan's largest automaker comes
a day after the U.S.-based credit rating agency downgraded two
other Japanese car companies, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and Nissan
Motor Corp. Moody's lowered its assessment of Toyota and its
subsidiaries' ability to repay their debts to ``Aa1.'' Moody's had
given Japan's largest automaker its top rating of ``Aaa.'' As the
lower credit rating warns of a higher risk for the companies'
lenders, it could raise borrowing costs for the automaker. Still,
the double-A rating remains quite high and allows Toyota to retain
its position as the top-rated Japanese automaker. Moody's said the
carmaker may see revenues slip due to rising competition and
falling demand in the struggling economies of Japan and Southeast
Asia, which together account for about half of Toyota's sales.

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland _ Residents of the shattered town of
Omagh on Thursday bury the final eight of 28 civilians killed in a
car bombing, Northern Ireland's worst terrorist strike in three
decades. More funerals for victims of political violence were held
Wednesday than in any other single day during Northern Ireland's
three decades of sectarian violence. Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern announced plans to close down the Irish Republican Army
dissidents who planted Saturday's car bomb that killed 28 people
and wounded 220. Ahern said he considered his government's
initiatives ``extremely draconian'' but added he was not prepared
to risk more attacks by dissidents of the Real IRA splinter group,
which admitted responsibility for the carbombing. (NORTHERN
IRELAND)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ In developments that could mean more trouble
for President Bill Clinton, prosecutors gathered a sample of his
DNA and turned to Monica Lewinsky for additional testimony about
the presidential affair and alleged cover-up. Friends and
associates of Ms. Lewinsky said she was hurt by Clinton's
characterization of their relationship, that Ms. Lewinsky felt that
she and the president had a deeper bond with emotional ties. One
friend said that when Ms. Lewinsky filed a sworn affidavit in
January denying a sexual relationship, it was in an effort to
protect the president. When the president said in a televised
address Monday night that he had an inappropriate relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky, he ``didn't really speak to the pain everyone else
has experienced in this,'' one of the former intern's friends said.
Several sources said Wednesday that the DNA sample from Clinton
went to investigators for an FBI analysis of a dress Ms. Lewinsky
said was stained from a sexual encounter with the president.

	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ The surprise offer by a rebel coalition to
negotiate a cease-fire with Congo's government is the first time
the rebels have indicated they are willing to deal with President
Laurent Kabila, whom they accuse of corruption. The rebels'
surprise move came Wednesday after two weeks of rapid military
advances in which they captured key towns in eastern Congo and
opened a second front in the west. Kabila's information minister,
Didier Mumengi, said he had not discussed the offer with the
Congolese president, but he believed the government would only
negotiate with representatives of Uganda and Rwanda, which Congo
accuses of masterminding the rebellion. The shift comes shortly
after four southern African countries announced support for
Kabila's government and Zimbabwe said it would send troops to
support Kabila _ moves that threatened to embroil the region in
war. (CONGO)
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ India began evacuating 50,000 people from
towns and villages threatened Thursday by rising water in the
Indian Himalayas, where landslides killed an estimated 239 people
during the past two days, officials said. Engineers planned to
dynamite a blockage of boulders and mud in the Mandakini River,
which was backing up and forming a lake that threatened to submerge
five towns and 25 villages. Three more landslides struck Wednesday,
killing 37 people in the area about 300 kilometers (180 miles)
north of New Delhi where farmers and villagers have stripped
mountains of their trees for firewood and to make way for terraced
crop fields. Rescuers recovered nine bodies on Wednesday and found
18 survivors shivering from cold and in shock. (INDIA-LANDSLIDE)
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi offered
Thursday to end her roadside standoff with the military regime if
the government agrees to free jailed members of her political
party. Suu Kyi's health was ``failing'' nine days into the standoff
but she was in ``high spirits,'' according to a statement released
by the National League for Democracy, her political party. The
offer came on the eve of the Friday deadline set by Suu Kyi for the
government to finally convene a parliament elected in 1990 but
never allowed to meet, part of her renewed campaign against the
government. Doctors took blood samples, fearing the 53-year-old Suu
Kyi may have contracted jaundice or another disease after spending
nine days in the van with three colleagues on a small country
bridge. Suu Kyi is engaged in her fourth confrontation in two
months with the military government over her right to travel freely
within Myanmar, also known as Burma. (MYANMAR-SUU KYI.)

Spanish communist leader leaves hospital after heart attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CORDOBA, Spain (AP) _ Spanish Communist Party leader Julio
Anguita left hospital in this southern town Thursday, four days
after suffering a heart attack, medical officials said.
	   Anguita, 57, was said to be fully recovered from the attack but
was not expected to return to full-time work as head of the United
Left coalition for at least a month.
	   During his stay he received visits and message of support from
politicians throughout Spain and as well as from Cuban leader Fidel
Castro who offered him the use of the Caribbean island's health
services if he needed.
	   Anguita, who also had a heart attack in May 1993, was on
vacation when he was rushed to the hospital Monday afternoon
complaining of severe chest pains. Emergency room doctors operated
on him to clear a blocked coronary artery, hospital officials said.
	   Spain's third biggest parliamentary group, United Left won 11
percent of the votes in the last general elections in 1996.
	   The Spanish left is dominated by the Socialist party, a
center-left grouping that ruled for nearly 14 years until it was
defeated in the 1996 election by the center-right Popular Party.

Iraq rejects Butler's request to allow resumption of inspections

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Thursday turned down a request by
the chief U.N. weapons inspector to resume cooperation with his
teams, saying the arms monitors were receiving orders from
Washington.
	   Richard Butler sent a letter to Baghdad on Wednesday asking Iraq
to allow the resumption of weapons inspections that Iraq suspended
on Aug.5
	   Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Iraq will not allow
the resumption of inspections by United Nations Special Commission
as long as it was dictated by the United States.
	   ``Butler and some elements in the Special Commission are not
international employees but serve the American policies to maintain
the sanctions on Iraq by following its orders,'' Aziz said in a
statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency.
	   ``The decision (to suspend inspections) is final and will not be
changed until the Security Council seriously, responsibly and
fairly looks into Iraq's demands without American pressures,'' Aziz
said.
	   Butler's letter to Aziz came after the Security Council earlier
this week gave him only general backing and not the clear
instructions he had sought in the face of Baghdad's decision.
	   Baghdad announced Aug. 5 that it was ceasing cooperation with
the United Nations because Butler refused to certify that Iraq had
destroyed its banned weapons.
	   The United Nations has sent similar, non-threatening messages to
Baghdad recently, with the Security Council's only muted response
that Iraq's decision to stop working with U.N. inspectors was
``totally unacceptable.''
	   Washington has also toned down its reaction and Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright has acknowledged she advised inspectors
against some surprise inspections for fear that a confrontation
would further split the divided council.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, has said repeatedly that
his country won't reverse its decision unless the council makes
swift movement toward lifting the sanctions.
	   The letter comes as the U.N. chief's envoy, Prakash Shah was on
his way back to New York after failing to persuade Iraq to resume
cooperation with inspectors. Shah was tentatively scheduled to
brief the council on Monday.
	   According to Security Council resolutions, U.N. inspectors must
be accompanied by Iraqi escorts when they carry out inspections.
	   Iraq claims it has complied with U.N. resolutions and says the
United States is manipulating inspections to maintain sanctions.
	   The inspectors must certify that Baghdad has eliminated all its
weapons of mass destruction before the sanctions can be lifted. The
sanctions were imposed following Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

Four Italian tourists killed in car crash in northern Greece
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ Four Italian tourists were killed
Thursday when their car crashed into a truck parked on a road in
northern Greece, police said.
	   The car driver, Franco Bagnari, 50, and three passengers,
Ornella Zanellaro, 49, Frederico Alfieri and Paola Carla Zanotti,
both 51, were killed in the accident. No hometowns for the four
were immediately available.
	   Authorities said the Italians had been speeding when they plowed
into the back of a cement truck stopped on hilly road near Nea
Moudania, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of the port of
Salonica.
	   The truck driver, 36-year-old Dimitris Malamidis, had failed to
place a warning triangle behind his vehicle when he stopped to help
the slightly injured driver of a car that had overturned, police
said.

Prosecutor who led Milan corruption probe considers new post
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The prosecutor who directed the ``Clean Hands''
corruption probe which swept away an entire political class is
considering leaving his post.
	   ``This is not abandoning the ship,'' Francesco Saverio Borrelli
was quoted as saying by Italian dailies Thursday. ``It is a normal
progression of my career.'' Borrelli, who has twice before
announced his departure but stayed on under pressure from his
colleagues, said he would make a final decision in September.
	   The prosecutor said he is thinking of applying for a higher job
in Milan that would see him lead prosecution of appeals cases,
including many politicians and businessmen he and his team had
prosecuted. Some opponents said it would be unfair to defendants to
have the same prosecutor twice.
	   The Clean Hands investigation, launched in 1992 by Borrelli,
shook the foundations of Italy's political and business
establishment. Convictions ranging from bribery to corruption to
extortion have been handed out to top figures.
	   Among those convicted by the lower courts have been two former
premiers: Socialist leader Bettino Craxi and conservative media
magnate Silvio Berlusconi.
	   Borrelli said this team would continue the probes even if left.
	   The prosecutor announced his plans just as President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro launched an appeal aimed at reducing the highly
politicized atmosphere over the Italian justice system.
	   Scalfaro on Wednesday urged caution in making judgments about
the suicide last week of a Sardinian prosecutor shortly after he
was questioned by a team of Sicilian prosecutors about his alleged
involvement in a kidnapping case.

Asian markets mixed on firmer yen, profit-taking
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets ended mixed Thursday, with
a firmer Japanese currency continuing to boost some markets, while
others fell slightly on profit-taking from recent market rallies.
	   In Japan, speculation about yen-supportive intervention in
foreign exchange markets by monetary authorities kept the U.S.
dollar under pressure, following a recent rally to eight-year highs
against the yen, dealers said.
	   In late trading in Tokyo, the dollar bought 142.55 yen, down
1.61 yen from late Wednesday and also below its late New York rate
of 143.93 yen overnight.
	   The latest in a series of warnings came Thursday from the head
of the Japanese Finance Ministry's international bureau, Haruhiko
Kuroda, who said the ministry still views the yen as too weak
against the dollar and will ``intervene appropriately as
necessary.''
	   ``We'd like to be well prepared for intervention,'' said Tatsuya
Ishii, senior sales manager and head of customer foreign exchange
at Banque Nationale de Paris in Tokyo. ``At the moment, the
dollar's downside risk is greater than the upside.''
	   Meanwhile, Japanese share prices drifted lower on profit-taking
following two days of gains. The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average shed 14.93 points, or 0.10 percent, to close at 15,391.41
after gaining more than 600 point in the previous two days.
	   In Seoul, share prices were sharply up, with the key Kospi index
soaring 4.9 percent to 316.59 points on the Japanese yen's gain and
rising hopes of a peaceful resolution of the ongoing labor strife
at Hyundai Motor Co.
	   Thousands of workers have been camping out in protest mass
layoffs. Government negotiators reported some progress in
negotiations.
	   In Hong Kong, the government was seen propping up blue-chip
shares again in its effort to fend off speculators trying to profit
in both the currency and stock markets.
	   Analysts said investors were scrambling to cover short positions
because of the market's sharp recent rise.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 1.6 percent to 7,742.53,
after leaping 5.7 percent Wednesday. The index has jumped 16
percent in the past four trading days largely because of government
intervention.
	   In Malaysia, shares climbed again with the Composite Index
finishing 2.2 percent higher at 351.04 points.
	   Much of the buying was speculative, traders said, fueled by
announcements of new economic measures and the government's
declaration to again resort to state investment and pension funds
to prop up the market.
	   In New Zealand, the key NZSE-40 index jumped 3.2 percent to
2,031.65 points as the market welcomed the easing of monetary
policy by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. The rise reflected
investors' positive outlook on inflation and interest rates,
brokers said.

	   BANGKOK: Thai stock prices ended slightly lower as declines by
financial issues on profit taking halted a two-day rally. The Stock
Exchange of Thailand index was off 0.37 point at 243.00 points.

buying stocks on the back of an advancing peso and other regional
currencies, traders said. The key Philippine Stock Exchange index
increased 1.9 percent to 1,390.93.

shares in anticipation that companies will report poor results. The
JSX composite index fell 1.6 percent to 399.330 points.
	   TAIPEI: Taiwan shares ended lower as continuing worries over the
economic slowdown prompted investors to sell shares, analysts said.

Palestinian governor: settlers can only leave encampment en masse
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMMED DARAGHMEH &QC;

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ Standing before a dusty shrine to the
biblical figure Joseph, the Palestinian governor of Nablus declared
Thursday that he won't let dozens of Jewish settlers holed up
inside the compound leave unless they all go together.
	   Settlers responded that the group would not leave unless others
are allowed to take their place, Israel radio said.
	   The latest exchange signaled that efforts to negotiate an end to
the standoff are failing. Israeli opposition legislator Yossi Sarid
warned that the situation was becoming increasingly explosive.
	   Several dozen Jewish seminary students have been staying in the
Joseph's Tomb compound for the past two weeks, since coming to sit
shiva, or hold ritual mourning, for two seminary students killed at
a nearby settlement, Itzhar. Many of the mourners also live in
Itzhar.
	   The Palestinians initially agreed to let the seminary students
to stay for a week, but after the mourning period was up, the group
remained in the compound. Palestinian police have besieged the
site, but have let trucks with food and supplies pass.
	   ``This situation will continue until they give in on their
position,'' Alool said Thursday.
	   Yigal Amitai, a settler leader from Itzhar, said Alool did not
have authority over the tomb, which is under Israeli control even
though it is in Palestinian-ruled Nablus. ``They (the Palestinians)
should remember that the Israelis control the land around their
land, and we will also take action.''
	   Earlier Thursday, Palestinians in black masks burned an effigy
of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a demonstration in
Nablus against Israel's control over Jerusalem. About 250 people
took part in the demonstration, holding banners that said ``Ending
the Occupation is Our Sacred Duty'' and ``Break the roadblocks
around Jerusalem.''
	   The Palestinians want to establish a future capital in east
Jerusalem, which Israel captured in 1967, but Israel says it will
never relinquish sovereignty over any of the city.

Prime Minister: devaluation, debt restructuring needed to stave off
</HEADLINE>
default &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kiriyenko to meet with foreign investors, Central
Bank chairman pledging to protect bank clients, Duma preparing for
emergency session. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's devaluation of the ruble and suspension
of debt payments was a last-ditch effort to avoid a full default,
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said.
	   ``If we were to continue servicing our debt and making payments
on treasury bills we would be unable to pay wages and pensions,''
Kiriyenko said in remarks broadcast by Russian television.
	   Kiriyenko scheduled a meeting with foreign investors later on
Thursday. He said they were working on a compromise debt payment
schedule.
	   ``We're not going to refuse to return this money to them, but
act together to calmly and thoroughly analyze the real
opportunities we have,'' the prime minister told the Cabinet.
	   Russia's financial crisis deepened this month as stocks fell
sharply and investors fled Russian bonds en masse even though rates
soared to 200 percent.
	   The Central Bank acknowledged Thursday that Russia's hard
currency reserves fell sharply in the days before the devaluation
was announced, falling nearly dlrs 2 billion last week _ from dlrs
17 billion as of Aug. 7 to dlrs 15.1 billion last Friday.
	   The government has continually failed to pay wages and pensions
to millions of Russians, sparking social protests in several
regions of Russia, including a sporadic coal miners' blockade of
the Trans-Siberian railway.
	   Kiriyenko said the suspension of payments on treasury bills
would add between 200 and 250 billion rubles (dlrs 29 and 36
billion) to state coffers over the next 18 months that would help
pay back wages.
	   Unpaid wages grew by 6.5 percent in July and stood at 75.8
billion rubles (around dlrs 11 billion) as of the beginning of this
month, but only 20 percent of that is owed by the state.
	   The government had initially planned to announce the terms of
debt restructuring on Wednesday but postponed it until Monday under
pressure from foreign investors who feared that Russia was going to
offer them a worse deal than Russian banks. Those terms were
believed to be the top agenda item for Kiriyenko's session with the
investors later in the day.
	   Meanwhile, the ruble's value remained virtually unchanged
Thursday at the Moscow currency exchange controlled by the Central
Bank which serves to set the official exchange rate, falling to
6.995 from 6.99 at Wednesday's close.
	   The government has decided to allow the ruble to sink as low as
9.5 to the dollar, but is hoping that it will shortly stabilize at
around 7. Most bankers share this forecast and street rates for
selling dollars, which plunged to 9.5 and below earlier this week,
has stabilized around 7.5 to 8 at booths around Moscow on Thursday.
	   A longer-term forecast would strongly depend on the government's
stabilization efforts and the position of Russian commercial banks,
many of which are now in trouble because of over-dependence on
ruble assets.
	   Moving to avert panic, Central Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin
assured Russians that their bank deposits were ``100 percent''
safe. He also urged Russia's commercial banks to create a system of
mutual guarantees on all deposits.
	   In a bid to vent popular anger over the painful moves, the
government established a hotline for Russians to report unfair
price hikes and make their proposals on how to overcome the crisis.
The tax police have promised to crack down on businesses which
unfairly crank up consumer prices.
	   The government on Thursday also discussed next year's draft
budget which is now being recalculated.
	   Kiriyenko said the government would proceed from the most
pessimistic scenario, assuming that world prices for oil and
natural gas _ Russia's main exports _ would remain low.
	   Meanwhile, lawmakers in the Russian parliament's lower house,
the State Duma, geared up for an emergency session on Friday. The
government has long asked the Duma to meet and consider a package
of austerity measures aimed at boosting revenues, but lawmakers
have resisted.

	   BERLIN (AP) _ In the first verdict of its kind in Germany, two
former East German doctors and a coach who confessed to
systematically giving performance-boosting drugs to female swimmers
in the 1970s and '80s were convicted of causing bodily harm
Thursday, but spared prison time.
	   The five defendants had admitted giving anabolic steroids to
unwitting athletes, some as young as 12 at the time, as part of the
former communist country's state-sponsored drive to create Olympic
champions.
	   But all denied knowingly damaging the health of their young
charges, saying they knew little about possible side-effects of the
pink and blue pills.
	   The Berlin state court ruled, however, that simply administering
anabolic steroids to the athletes was enough to warrant conviction,
regardless of whether the girls suffered later side-effects.
	   Although the defendants could have received up to three years in
prison, the court imposed only fines: 27,000 marks (dlrs 15,000)
for Dr. Ulrich Suender, who distributed the pills to the team
doctors; 7,200 marks (dlrs 4,000) for former team doctor Dorit
Roesler; and 7,000 marks (dlrs 3,900) to former coach Peter
Mattonet.
	   The court said it went easy on the three because they had
confessed and apologized to the swimmers affected.
	   The court dropped the charges against two other coaches, Berndt
Christochowitz, 40, and Klaus Klemenz, 55, ruling they were less
involved and bore only limited guilt in the doping program. The
court ordered Christochowitz to pay 7,500 marks (dlrs 4,200) and
Klemenz 3,000 marks (dlrs 1,670) to charity.
	   All five were charged with causing bodily harm to as many as 17
young female swimmers on East Germany's TSC Berlin team from 1978
to 1989. Neither the athletes nor their parents were informed about
what they were taking.
	   One is now sterile because her hormonal balance was disrupted by
the steroids, which she started taking at 13. Others suffered such
side-effects as deeper voices, serious acne and excessive hair
growth.
	   Prosecutors have said they hope convictions in this case and
another still running will provide a basis for bringing charges
against higher-ups who ordered and oversaw the doping program,
which helped small East Germany win dozens of gold medals at the
Olympics and other championships.
	   Although doping was long suspected in East Germany's sports
program, few athletes were ever caught in tests. But evidence
emerged from communist files after German unification.
	   The first trial, which began March 18, involves coaches and
doctors from the former showcase swim team Dynamo Berlin. It
resumes Monday.

FBI chief arrives to oversee bombing probe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RODRIQUE NGOWI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ FBI director Louis Freeh said
Thursday investigators have not reached any conclusions regarding
possible involvement of two men still being held by the Tanzanians
in connection with the bombing of the U.S. embassy.
	   But another agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation told
reporters they would be right to assume there was a link between
the nearly simultaneous bombings Aug. 7 of the mission in Dar es
Salaam and in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.
	   Freeh arrived in Tanzania from Washington, D.C. Thursday and
toured the damaged embassy before meeting with FBI agents and
Tanzanian officials who have been investigating the bombing in
which 10 people _ eight Tanzanians, one Kenyan and one Somali _
died.
	   ``We haven't made any conclusions that anybody being held here
is connected at this point to the bombing,'' Freeh told reporters.
``But we do want to continue to work with our colleagues here to
interview not just those individuals, but other individuals who may
have information.''
	   Tanzanian Home Affairs Minister Ali Ameir Mohammed has confirmed
that two men of 14 originally detained are still in custody, but he
will not give their names nor their nationalities.
	   The bomb blasts occurred almost simultaneously. In Nairobi, 247
people, including 12 Americans, were killed, and more than 5,000
people were injured, most of them by flying glass and debris.
	   In response to a question about a link between the two bombings,
FBI agent Kenneth Piernick said: ``You would probably be right to
assume a connection between events in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam,
based on the similarities of the events.''
	   Freeh, who was to travel later Thursday to Nairobi, said the
Tanzanian investigation was going well but added that local police
and FBI were still looking for witnesses to interview.
	   Kenyan police said last week they were holding ``at least five
people'' in connection with their investigation. But there have
been unconfirmed reports of more people being brought in for
questioning.
	   Freeh, who met with Ameir and Tanzanian Director of Criminal
Investigations Rajabi Adadi, said cooperation in the investigation
was good.
	   Ameir said Freeh offered to send Tanzanian police to Washington,
where most of the forensic evidence is being analyzed.

Non-Muslim foreign aid workers told to leave Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ U.S. officials have warned non-Muslim
foreign aid workers to leave Afghanistan because they are in
danger, the U.S. Embassy spokesman in neighboring Pakistan said
Thursday.
	   Spokesman Richard Hoagland said U.S. officials learned last week
of threats, and the information was passed on Wednesday to aid
agencies and the United Nations.
	   ``It's a security advisory, that means there are credible
threats,'' Hoagland said, refusing to elaborate on what was
threatened or how the threats were received.
	   On Tuesday, the United States evacuated all but essential
embassy and consul staff in Pakistan in a move linked to the Aug. 7
bombings at two U.S. embassies in East Africa that killed 257
people.
	   A suspect in the bombings was arrested in Pakistan and handed
over to U.S. and Kenyan investigators. The suspect reportedly told
Pakistani interrogators the attacks were the work of Osama bin
Laden, a Saudi living in Afghanistan who has encouraged Muslims to
attack U.S. interests.
	   Independent aid agencies were holding meetings Thursday to
discuss the U.S. warning to non-Muslims in Afghanistan, most of
which is controlled by the Taliban Islamic militia.
	   U.N. spokeswoman Sarah Russell said that of the 34 non-Afghan
U.N. aid workers in Afghanistan on Wednesday, one American staffer
and several people of other nationalities who had been visiting
left as a result of the U.S. warning.
	   ``We're not instructing staff to leave. They have to make their
own decisions,'' Russell said. ``While we don't know what the
threat is, it's hard to assess the situation. We don't know what
could happen, when it might happen.''
	   She said U.N. operations would continue. The United Nations
employs thousands of Afghans in Afghanistan.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Warning poor countries to beware
``greedy'' foreign currency speculators, Malaysia's prime minister

	   ``Free markets must be regulated or else greedy traders will

	   Mahathir has repeatedly blamed Western currency speculators for
triggering Asia's financial troubles and has called for clampdowns
on global currency trading.
	   Mahathir has been touring the nation recently in an effort to

focused on efforts to revive the economy.
	   Last weekend, he said the government may adopt drastic new
measures to prevent further economic deterioration. He warned some
people might be shocked. He reiterated that concern Thursday in a
meeting with Malaysian contractors.
	   ``We hope all parties will support the government's efforts,''
Mahathir said. He added the new measures ``may seem extraordinary
to others, but not to us. Because it is going to save us.''
	   Mahathir said the country could surmount its economic woes as
long as riots were avoided as the government crafts its economic
recovery plan.
	   ``We can overcome this economic crisis if everybody continues to
be calm and there's no rioting,'' Mahathir said.
	   Rumors of ethnic riots swept through the capital two weeks ago,
which sparked panic buying at supermarkets and forced many to rush
home from work and bolt their doors.
	   Three people have been arrested under the Internal Security Act,
which permits jail without trial, for allegedly circulating riot
rumors on the Internet.
	   Mahathir stressed that the country's affirmative action policy,
known as the New Economic Policy, would remain in place to promote
racial harmony.
	   The social-economic policy began in the early 1970s to help the
majority ethnic Malay population get a larger share of the economy,
previously dominated by the minority ethnic Chinese. Critics say
the plan fosters cronyism and corruption.
	   The prime minister also blasted foreign influences, saying he
feared they would take advantage of Malaysia's weakened stock
market.
	   Share prices on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange have shed more
than 75 percent in value since February while Malaysia's currency,
the ringgit, has lost almost 40 percent of its value against the
U.S. dollar since July 1997.
	   The government predicts the economy will contract by up to 2
percent this year, but private economists predict a shrinkage of as
much as 4 percent to 5 percent.

Hill resigns as Soccer Australia chairman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Soccer Australia chairman David Hill,
who brought Terry Venables to Australia as national coach, will
stand down, he said Thursday.
	   Hill said he was quitting to concentrate on the pending federal
election where he will stand as a Labor Party candidate.
	   Hill's biggest coup was his expensive move to sign former
England manager Venables. While Australia went unbeaten through its
World Cup campaign under Venables, it missed the finals on the away
goals rule and Venables moved on to Crystal Palace.
	   Hill has also been working to have Australia included in the
Asian zone qualification for the 2002 World Cup rather than its
current Oceania affiliation.

Three patients killed in latest hospital bungle

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Three kidney patients died and three others
were left in critical condition on Thursday when contaminated water
was inadvertently pumped into their dialysis machines, doctors
said.
	   Walton Li, deputy medical superintendent of the Happy Valley
Sanatorium, told reporters that the hospital's water system, which
was under repair, was inadvertently switched on before antiseptics
could have been flushed out.
	   ``This was a break in procedure,'' Li said. ``There is a
possibility of human error. At that time we did not expect the
(water filtration) system to be operational.''
	   It is the latest in a spate of hospital bungles _ many
injurious, some deadly _ that have shaken public confidence in one
of Asia's most advanced health care systems.
	   Michael Ho, chairman of the legislature's health services panel,
called the incident ``a human error'' and called for sweeping
changes in the public health system. The Department of Health has
asked the hospital to submit investigation results in two weeks.
	   Tung Chee-hwa, the territory's chief executive, said in a
statement he was ``shocked and distressed.''
	   ``We need to restore public confidence in our health services.
We will do everythig that is required to do so,'' he said.
	   Li said the renal osmosis system _ the original water purifying
mechanism _ was being repaired at that time. While the back-up
filtration system was being used, the original was inadvertently
switched on.
	   Li said it was ``normal procedure'' for the original water
purifying system to be tested before being used in the dialysis
machine.
	   ``It's clear there was human error,'' said Anita Ng, whose
61-year old mother-in-law Cheong Siu-chun was recovering from the
ordeal in the hospital's intensive care unit.
	   Ng added that the relatives of the patients are hiring a lawyer
to seek compensation from the hospital, which is in one of Hong
Kong's upscale residential districts.
	   While Hong Kong's public health officials insist there are no
more problems than usual _ just more coverage of them _ the outcry
has been strong enough to call for sweeping changes.
	   In April, a painkiller that could harm both mother and fetus was
injected into 526 pregnant women after a hospital pharmacist failed
to verify the drug's contents. None of the women was informed of
the incidents.
	   A year ago, an 84-year-old woman died after staff mixed up tubes
and pumped oxygen into her blood instead of into the air cushion
under her neck. Shortly after, a student nurse in an intensive care
unit mistakenly connected a nutrition pack to an intravenous line,
sending milk streaming into a patient's bloodstream.

Unocal and partners to sell condensate to Thai state oil firm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's state oil company has signed
a agreement to buy condensate from three offshore gas field
concessions in which a subsidiary of the U.S. oil company Unocal
holds majority interests, Unocal announced Thursday.
	   Unocal Thailand, Mitsui Oil Exploration Co and PTT Exploration
and Production signed a 15-year condensate agreement with the
Petroleum Authority of Thailand, Unocal said in a news release.
Mitsui and PTTEP hold minority stakes in the offshore fields.
	   The deal should help Thailand reduce oil imports and save
foreign exchange, the statement said.
	   Eleven Unocal-operated fields in the Gulf of Thailand produce
about 35,000 barrels of condensate per day, most of which was
previously exported. The amount is equal to 5 percent of the
700,000 barrels of day of oil that Thailand imports.
	   Condensate is produced along with natural gas, and is used as
blending stock in oil refining and as feedstock for petrochemicals.

Biggest Dutch bank reports 20 percent profit growth in 1998's first
</HEADLINE>
half &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Leading Dutch bank ABN Amro
Holding NV said Thursday net profit rose 20 percent to 2.45 billion
guilders (dlrs 1.21 billion) in the first half of 1998, as strong
performances worldwide made up for minor negative effects of the
economic turmoil in Asia.
	   ABN Amro said it expects net profit in the second half to
increase compared with the same period in 1997 assuming the
economic situation in Asia and Russia does not significantly
deteriorate.
	   The bank's revenue rose from 11.36 billion guilders (dlrs 5.61
billion) in the first six months of 1997 to 13.60 billion guilders
(dlrs 6.72 billion) in the like period this year.
	   ABN Amro increased provisions for loan losses again in 1998's
first half to 892 million guilders (dlrs 440.9 million) from 492
million guilders (dlrs 243.2 million) in the comparative period of
1997 largely due to higher reserves for loan losses in a number of
specific countries, including Indonesia, Thailand, Pakistan and
Turkey.
	   Results from financial transactions rose 69 percent to 666
million guilders (dlrs 329.2 million) in the first half of 1998.
	   The bank noted that currency volatility in a number of foreign
exchange markets led to a significant rise in currency trading
results.
	   In North America, pretax profits rose 39 percent to 1.1 billion
guilders (dlrs 543.7 million) compared with the same period in
1997.
	   In the Asia Pacific region, pretax profits fell 1.7 percent to
169 million guilders (dlrs 83.5 million), mainly on bad-debt
provisions for country risks. But the bank noted that the
provisions were ``relatively limited,'' due to the significant
proportion of multinationals in its Asian portfolio.
	   ABN's stock on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange rose 1.50 guilders
(dlrs 0.74), or 3 percent, to 51.60 guilders (dlrs 25.50), in early
trading while the 27-share AEX index was up just 0.5 percent.

Slovak TV terminates its Hungarian brodcast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) - Slovak public TV has terminated
its weekly one-hour broadcast for the country's large Hungarian
minority to replace it by a program focusing on all ethnic
minorities in Slovakia, a TV official said Thursday.
	   An assistant to the spokesman, who refused to be named, said
that in the new program Hungarians will retain as much broadcasting
time as in the original broadcast.
	   But a Bratislava-based Hungarian journalist said that Hungarians
are to be dedicated just 10 minutes in the new program called
``They Live With Us,'' which will also focus on Gypsies,
Ukrainians, Croats, Poles and Serbs.
	   ``Three Hungarian editors have been fired because they didn't
broadcast `appropriate' information on the Slovak government,''
Marta Orosz of the Hungarian-language Uj Szo daily said.
	   She said that the decision to terminate the Hungarian program
``wasn't fair because there are far more Hungarians living in
Slovakia than any other minority.''
	   About 600,000 ethnic Hungarians live in Slovakia, a country of
5,5 million.
	   The top cvandidate of the party of the Hungarian minority, Bela
Bugar, sharply criticized on Wednesday the measures inside Slovak
state televison.
	   He told the Austria Press Agency by telephone that the
government of Premier Vladmir Meciar was evidently determined to
use all means to weaken the political opponents in the current
election campaign. Slovak parliamentary elections are scheduled for
Sept. 25-26.
	   He said the discontinuation of Slovak-language programming and
and the layoff of three of four editors was due to the fact that
the broadcasts so far had not fulfilled the political expectations
of the ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia.
	   Slovakia often has been criticized for its approach to the
Hungarian minority. A language law, passed by Meciar's ruling
coalition in 1995, practically forbade the use of minority
languages for public business.
	   Concern over Meciar's authoritarian style already has helped
push Slovakia off a list of five Eastern European nations granted a
``fast track'' to European Union membership, and sent the country
to the back of a line of nations hoping to join NATO.

Iraq rejects Butler's request to allow resumption of inspections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 6-7 with more quotes; ADDS background in 8th
graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Thursday turned down a request by
the chief U.N. weapons inspector to resume cooperation with his
teams, saying the arms monitors were receiving orders from
Washington.
	   Richard Butler sent a letter to Baghdad on Wednesday asking Iraq
to allow the resumption of weapons inspections that Iraq suspended
on Aug.5
	   Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Iraq will not allow
the resumption of inspections by United Nations Special Commission
as long as it was dictated by the United States.
	   ``Butler and some elements in the Special Commission are not
international employees but serve the American policies to maintain
the sanctions on Iraq by following its orders,'' Aziz said in a
statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency.
	   ``The decision (to suspend inspections) is final and will not be
changed until the Security Council seriously, responsibly and
fairly looks into Iraq's demands without American pressures,'' Aziz
said.
	   ``Butler does not want to tell the U.N. Security Council and the
world that UNSCOM has completed its task in the field of
disarmament,'' Aziz said.
	   ``We became categorically certain during the recent meeting that
Butler intentionally maneuvers, procrastinates and mixes between
the basic issues that have to do with disarmament requirements, and
secondary and fabricated issues,'' Aziz added.
	   Butler cut short a visit to Baghdad earlier this month after
talks with Aziz, who demanded a clean bill of health on Baghdad's
weapons programs.
	   Butler's letter to Aziz came after the Security Council earlier
this week gave him only general backing and not the clear
instructions he had sought in the face of Baghdad's decision.
Baghdad announced Aug. 5 that it was ceasing cooperation with the
United Nations because Butler refused to certify that Iraq had
destroyed its banned weapons.
	   The United Nations has sent similar, non-threatening messages to
Baghdad recently, with the Security Council's only muted response
that Iraq's decision to stop working with U.N. inspectors was
``totally unacceptable.''
	   Washington has also toned down its reaction and Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright has acknowledged she advised inspectors
against some surprise inspections for fear that a confrontation
would further split the divided council.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, has said repeatedly that
his country won't reverse its decision unless the council makes
swift movement toward lifting the sanctions.
	   The letter comes as the U.N. chief's envoy, Prakash Shah was on
his way back to New York after failing to persuade Iraq to resume
cooperation with inspectors. Shah was tentatively scheduled to
brief the council on Monday.
	   According to Security Council resolutions, U.N. inspectors must
be accompanied by Iraqi escorts when they carry out inspections.
	   Iraq claims it has complied with U.N. resolutions and says the
United States is manipulating inspections to maintain sanctions.
	   The inspectors must certify that Baghdad has eliminated all its
weapons of mass destruction before the sanctions can be lifted. The
sanctions were imposed following Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

Fulton quits as Australian coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Bob Fulton quit as Australia's rugby
league coach Thursday to look after his sick wife Ann.
	   Fulton's resignation after a successful nine-year reign was
effective immediately, ruling him out of next month's tests against
New Zealand.
	   Fulton took the Australian job in 1989 and was on the losing
side just six times in 39 tests, winning every series.
	   ``My wife Ann has an illness which needs my support and I want
to make sure I'm not away from home as much as I have been during
my time as Australian coach,'' Fulton said Thursday. ``Ann has
supported me totally during my playing and coaching career and now
it's time to give her my support.'' He did divulge the illness.
	   Australian officials tried to convince Fulton to stay on but he
refused.
	   ``It's been an honor and a privilege to coach Australia over
such a long period,'' Fulton said.
	   New Zealand coach Frank Endacott said he was saddened by
Fulton's decision.
	   ``He's had a bloody good innings,'' Endacott said. ``I've got
nothing but admiration and respect for the bloke and what he has
achieved with Australia and his club. He's taken a lot from people
over the years but he's always given plenty back.''
	   Australia, under a new coach, will tackle New Zealand on Oct. 9
and 16 following its 22-16 series-opening loss in the Anzac Eve
Test.
	   Brisbane's Wayne Bennett, Sydney City's Phil Gould and
Melbourne's Chris Anderson are considered the leading candidates
for the job.
	   ``Australia has loads of talent and will continue to dominate
the international scene,'' Fulton said.

Swiss seal off main square when land-mine-like device spotted

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Police set off a controlled explosion
in a main square of the Swiss financial capital Wednesday, blowing
up an object suspected of being a land mine, a spokesman said.
	   The round, plate-shaped object was reported by a passerby in
Limmatplatz shortly before noon (1000gmt), one of the busiest times
for the crossroads, said police spokesman Bruno Kistler.
	   The square, near the main railway station, was sealed off and a
robot was deployed to check the object and set off the explosion to
remove any danger.
	   The remains of the object were then handed over to specialists
for examination, Kistler said.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Bern was evacuated last Friday as a
precaution because of an anonymous telephone caller that warned
that ``something'' would happen.
	   A security spokesman said the call, which appeared in the end to
be ``a bad joke,'' had to be treated as a bomb threat to guard the
safety of the embassy staff and other people in the area.

Palestinian man arrested for killing his three pre-school sons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TULKAREM, West Bank (AP) _ A man stabbed his three young sons _
ages 1, 3 and 5 _ to death early Thursday in an apparent dispute
involving his two wives, Palestinian authorities said.
	   Abdel Lateef Bedo, 50, was under arrest in the northern West
Bank city of Tulkarem.
	   Tulkarem Governor Izzedine Sharif said Bedo came to the city
police station Thursday morning carrying a knife and told police,
``I killed my children.''
	   Bedo, who worked in Israel as a laborer, lived with his two
wives and their children in a small house in the Tulkarem refugee
camp, and there was apparently a conflict between the two wives,
Sharif said.
	   On Wednesday night, Bedo beat the mother of the three boys and
kicked her out of the house, Sharif said.
	   Sharif's other wife and their three daughters, who range from 16
to 26, were also arrested for questioning, Sharif said.
	   A neighbor said Sharif was frequently drunk.
	   Polygamy is permitted among Muslims living in the West Bank.

Army: 60 rebels and one soldier killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) _ At least 60 rebels and one soldier
were killed in an army operation to flush out rebels in rural
Bujumbara province, army spokesman Col. Isaie Nibizi said Thursday.
	   Nibizi said the army operation took place Wednesday morning in
Mutamu commune, 20 kilometers (12 miles) outside the capital. He
identified the rebels as those who earlier this month attacked a
camp for displaced Tutsis in northwestern Bubanza province. Eight
people were killed in the attack.
	   Nibizi said the army had seized 24 machine guns, four anti-tank
mines and documents in the operation.
	   Nizibi said fighting is still going on in Bubanza, Bujumbura
rural, Bururi, and Makamba provinces.
	   At least 200,000 people, most of them civilians, have been
killed in the latest cycle of ethnic violence in Burundi that
erupted in October 1993 when Tutsis paratroopers assassinated the
country's first Hutu president.
	   Tutsis, who make up only 14 percent of Burundi's population of 6
million, have run the country for all but four months since
independence in 1962. Hutus account for about 85 percent of the
population.
	   The rebels who belonging to the National Liberation Front of
Hutu extremists have refused to recognize a cease-fire agreed to at
all-party peace talks on Burundi held last month in neighboring
Tanzania.
	   The Burundian army said it was not bound by such an agreement
since it had to defend the population from attacks.

Airport site foreman sentenced for cheating wages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A former site foreman was sentenced to nine
months in jail Thursday for conspiring with others to cheat extra
wages from the territory's main airport contractor.
	   Chu Yau-keung, 40, was found guilty of conspiring with two other
foremen, Chung Tat-kuen and Hung Chi-man, to defraud the contractor
BCJ Joint Venture Company by using false records to claim wages,
the Independent Commission Against Corruption said in a statement.
	   The three men submitted false daily attendance sheets to BCJ
with the intention of claiming wages, the statement said. As a
result, BCJ paid 100,000 Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 12,820) in extra
wages.
	   The three men kept about two-thirds of the extra wages and
distributed the rest to the other workers, it said.
	   Of those charged in the same case, eight workers were earlier
ordered to perform community service and repay the money they
pocketed from the scheme, the statement said. Two of them also
received suspended jail sentences and Chung is to be sentenced next
month.
	   Chu was formerly employed by a local sub-contractor which
supplied workers to carry out remedial construction work of the new
Chek Lap Kok airport's passenger terminal.
	   He was ordered to pay BJC 12,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
1,544).
	   Last month, four airport workers were charged with bribery and
corruption for covering up shoddy construction of facilities
connected to the railroad at the airport.
	   The airport, built at a cost of 20 billion U.S. dlrs, opened in
early July, followed by a series of computer and mechanical
problems which led to serious cargo delays. The government
estimated the delays will cost Hong Kong a loss of 4.6 billion Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 589 million).
	   The government is investigating other allegations of corruption
and negligence at the airport.

Killy reports to IOC on Tour de France scandals

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with IOC announcing task force on four main topics in
new grafs 8-15; new quote in 21st graf &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Tour de France organizer
Jean-Claude Killy submitted proposals to an emergency IOC meeting
Thursday for dealing with the recent drug scandals which have
rocked the sports world.
	   Australian officials, meanwhile, proposed kicking drug-ridden
sports out of the Olympics, imposing financial penalties on drug
cheats and setting up a special IOC anti-doping agency.
	   Killy, a French IOC member and winner of three gold medals in
alpine skiing at the 1968 Grenoble Olympics, is president of the
company which runs the Tour de France.
	   This summer's race was thrown into turmoil by a series of
arrests and police raids which uncovered systematic use of the
banned endurance-boosting hormone EPO.
	   ``It was bad for sports in general and means we should make
decisions now and take steps that aim to correct the problem of
doping,'' Killy said.
	   The Tour de France scandals prompted International Olympic
Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch to convene Thursday's
special executive board meeting and schedule a worldwide doping
summit for early next year.
	   The IOC announced Thursday that the summit, originally planned
for January, would be held Feb. 2-3 in Lausanne and that more than
500 delegates were expected to attend.
	   Midway through Thursday's closed-door meeting, the IOC said it
had appointed its four vice presidents to lead task forces on four
general topics for the February summit:
	   _ the protection of athletes
	   _ political and legal issues, including the definition of doping
and cooperation with governments
	   _ ethics, prevention, education and communications
	   _ financial questions, including the commercial pressures which
can lead to drug use and the issue of financing the anti-doping
fight
	   ``The objective is to reach concrete, specific decisions and
measures,'' IOC director general Francois Carrard said. ``The
executive board is absolutely unanimous and totally dedicated to
the fight against doping. There is not the slightest doubt about
that.''
	   Anita DeFrantz of the United States will lead the task force on
protection of athletes, Keba Mbaye of Senegal on the political and
legal questions, Pal Schmitt of Hungary on ethics, and Dick Pound
of Canada on the financial matters.
	   Further specifics were expected to be announced at a news
conference later in the day.

	   TULKAREM, West Bank (AP) _ A man stabbed his three young sons _
ages 1, 3 and 5 _ to death early Thursday in an apparent dispute
involving his two wives, Palestinian authorities said.
	   Abdel Lateef Bedo, 50, was under arrest in the northern West
Bank city of Tulkarem.
	   Tulkarem Governor Izzedine Sharif said Bedo came to the city
police station Thursday morning carrying a knife and told police,
``I killed my children.''
	   Bedo, who worked in Israel as a laborer, lived with his two
wives and their children in a small house in the Tulkarem refugee
camp, and there was apparently a conflict between the two wives,
Sharif said.
	   On Wednesday night, Bedo beat the mother of the three boys and
kicked her out of the house, Sharif said.
	   Bedo's other wife and their three daughters, who range from 16
to 26, were also arrested for questioning.
	   A neighbor said Bedo was frequently drunk.
	   Polygamy is permitted among Muslims living in the West Bank.

Malaysian prime minister calls for regulations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to ADD Mahathir comment in 4th graf; TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Warning poor countries to beware
of ``greedy'' foreign currency speculators, Malaysia's prime
minister Thursday called for more regulation of global markets.
	   ``Free markets must be regulated or else greedy traders will
attack the currencies of poorer countries,'' Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad told a packed stadium during a political rally.
	   Mahathir has repeatedly blamed Western currency speculators for
triggering Asia's financial troubles and has called for clampdowns
on global currency trading.
	   Citing recent economic upheavals in Hong Kong and Russia,
Mahathir warned that ``as long as the world fails to address the
problems created by currency traders, all the nations in the world
will be vulnerable to their attack.''
	   Earlier this week, Hong Kong's government intervened in the
stock market to fight what it said were efforts by speculators to
manipulate the stock market. And, Russia's government devalued its
currency, the ruble, by 34 percent, after months of trying to prop
it up.
	   Mahathir has been touring the nation recently in an effort to
muster political support in meet-the-people rallies that have
focused on efforts to revive the economy.
	   Last weekend, he said the government may adopt drastic new
measures to prevent further economic deterioration. He warned some
people might be shocked. He reiterated that concern Thursday,
during an earlier meeting with Malaysian contractors.
	   ``We hope all parties will support the government's efforts,''
Mahathir said. He added the new measures ``may seem extraordinary
to others, but not to us. Because it is going to save us.''
	   Mahathir said the country could surmount its economic woes as
long as riots were avoided as the government crafts its economic
recovery plan.
	   ``We can overcome this economic crisis if everybody continues to
be calm and there's no rioting,'' Mahathir said.
	   Rumors of ethnic riots swept through the capital two weeks ago,
which sparked panic buying at supermarkets and forced many to rush
home from work and bolt their doors.
	   Three people have been arrested under the Internal Security Act,
which permits jail without trial, for allegedly circulating riot
rumors on the Internet.
	   The prime minister also blasted foreign influences, saying he
feared they would take advantage of Malaysia's weakened stock
market.
	   Share prices on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange have shed more
than 75 percent in value since February while Malaysia's currency,
the ringgit, has lost almost 40 percent of its value against the
U.S. dollar since July 1997.
	   The government predicts the economy will contract by up to 2
percent this year, but private economists predict a shrinkage of as
much as 4 percent to 5 percent.

Villa, United agree fee for Tobagan striker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Manchester United agreed Thursday to
pay Aston Villa 12 million pounds (dlrs 19.8 million) for striker
Dwight Yorke.
	   Manager Alex Ferguson hoped to persuade the Tobagan star to
agree personal terms later Thursday in time for a midnight deadline
so that Yorke can play in the next round of the European Champions
Cup.
	   ``The player is on his way from Birmingham at the moment and
will have talks this afternoon,'' United chairman Martin Edwards
said.
	   ``We are very happy at the way things are progressing at
present.''
	   Villa originally wanted 16 million pounds (dlrs 26.4 million)
for its longest serving player, a fee which would have beaten the
British transfer record 15 million (24.75 million) Newcastle paid
Blackburn Rovers for Alan Shearer two years ago.
	   In a long-running transfer wrangle, United originally offered a
little over half that and the two clubs eventually agreed a price
on Thursday.
	   Yorke joined Villa in 1990 from the Tobagan club St. Clair's as
a 17-year-old. In the last three seasons, he has scored 46 league
goals for the Birmingham club.

Swiss seal off main square when land-mine-like device spotted

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Police set off a controlled explosion
in a main square of the Swiss financial capital Thursday, blowing
up an object suspected of being a land mine, a spokesman said.
	   The round, plate-shaped object was reported by a passerby in
Limmatplatz shortly before noon (1000gmt), one of the busiest times
for the crossroads, said police spokesman Bruno Kistler.
	   The square, near the main railway station, was sealed off and a
robot was deployed to check the object and set off the explosion to
remove any danger.
	   The remains of the object were then handed over to specialists
for examination, Kistler said.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Bern was evacuated last Friday as a
precaution because of an anonymous telephone caller that warned
that ``something'' would happen.
	   A security spokesman said the call, which appeared in the end to
be ``a bad joke,'' had to be treated as a bomb threat to guard the
safety of the embassy staff and other people in the area.

Cambodia's election committee seeks an additional dlrs 1.3 in funds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The body charged with overseeing
last month's parliamentary elections appealed to international
donors Thursday for an additional dlrs 1.3 million to help pay
staff salaries.
	   The National Election Committee said that even though it intends
to dramatically reduce its 15,000-strong staff by the end of the
month, 200 people will stay on through December ``to ensure the
continuity for future elections.''
	   The election cost nearly dlrs 40 million, the bulk of which was
paid by international donors, especially the European Union and
Japan.
	   Last month the United Nations Development Program gave the NEC
dlrs 1.6 from its Trust Fund. That money was immediately spent to
pay salaries for 58,495 staff workers who worked at polling and
counting stations nationwide, the NEC said.
	   Chhay Kim, the body's treasurer, said the NEC still needs some
employees to update voters' lists, prepare for next year's commune
elections, and begin work on the 1999 budget.
	   Cambodian leader Hun Sen's ruling party won a slight majority in
last month's polls, but the opposition has so far refused to
recognize the results until allegations of fraud are investigated.
	   The NEC rejected all but eight of 800 complaints about
irregularities in voting and ballot counting.
	   The elections were held one year after Hun Sen ousted Prince
Norodom Ranariddh as his co-premier in a violent coup, shattering a
tense dual premiership formed after the 1993 elections.
	   Hun Sen hoped the elections would help him to win back
legitimacy and aid lost after his violent takeover.

	   Rescue crews in helicopters and boats were searching for the
plane's pilot and radar intercept officer, who apparently ejected

	   It was the second time in a week that a Greek air force jet has

its pilot was killed during a training run at a bombing range in

Greenpeace activists board Norwegian oil rig
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Eight activists from the environmental
organization Greenpeace boarded the Norwegian drilling rig Deepsea
Bergen Wednesday to protest against further exploration for new oil
and gas fields.
	   The protesters arrived in inflatable boats when the rig was
preparing to move to another location to continue its search for
oil. They climbed onto the rig and managed to fasten a survival pod
on the side of the rig.
	   The Deepsea Bergen which is operated by the Norwegian state oil
company Statoil, had just plugged a well on the continental shelf
120 nautical miles off the Norwegian town of Kristiansund, 400
kilometers (250 miles) northwest of Oslo, and was about to be moved
to a location further south.
	   ``Since we have already found more than four times as much
fossil fuels as we can burn without risking problems with the
climate, we think it is a waste of time and money to look for even
more,'' said Kalle Hesstvedt of Greenpeace to The Associated Press.
	   The activists, who are from Britain, Denmark, Sweden, Finland
and Norway, have enough equipment, food, water and solar cells to
continue their protest for some time, Hesstvedt said.

Japanese man arrested for selling Viagra
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Police arrested a 38-year-old man in western Japan
on Thursday on suspicion of selling Viagra, the country's first
arrest for sale of the anti-impotence drug.
	   Hiroyuki Shikata was accused of breaking the Pharmaceutical
Affairs Law by selling Viagra in Japan, where health authorities
have not yet approved the drug, police said.
	   Viagra has attracted wide attention here, with men's magazines
running articles about ways to circumvent the law and obtain the
drug _ including Viagra-buying ``tours'' to the United States.
	   Police arrested Shikata after learning he had sold bottles of
Viagra to 45 people, said an Osaka police spokesman who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   Shikata started buying the drug, produced by U.S.-based Pfizer
Inc., in May from a trading company at between 70,000 yen and
148,000 yen (dlrs 500-dlrs 1,050) per bottle.
	   He sold the 30-pill bottles for between 90,000 and 130,000 yen

clear why he sometimes sold the bottles for less than he paid for
them.

States.

Iraq and Syria agree to reopen oil pipeline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq and Syria signed an agreement Thursday
to reopen a pipeline for Iraqi crude oil that was closed 16 years
ago, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
	   The agreement was signed by Iraqi Oil Minister Amer Mohammed
Rashid and his Syrian counterpart, Mohammed Maher Jamal.
	   The two sides agreed to reopen the pipeline that links Iraq's
Kirkuk oil fields to the Mediterranean terminals of Banias in Syria
and Tripoli in Lebanon.
	   They also agreed to continue contacts to boost further
cooperation, INA said.
	   Iraq, which is under sweeping U.N. trade sanctions, has to get
U.N. Security Council approval before the pipeline can be opened.
	   Syria closed the pipeline in 1982 in support of Iran during its
eight-year war with Iraq. Jamal's visit is the first by a Syrian
oil minister since relations were cut at the beginning of the
1980-88 war.
	   Jamal told INA that that his visit to Iraq was ``fruitful and
successful.'' He said the two sides built the foundations for
future cooperation in the oil field.
	   The Syrian-Iraqi pipeline has an estimated capacity of 650,000
barrels a day. Rashid has said the pipeline would first pump
300,000 a day on an experimental basis. The two sides also are
discussing opening a second oil pipeline, with a capacity of 1.4
million barrels daily, and an oil refinery.
	   The 820-kilometer (556-mile) pipeline was opened in 1949. Syria
currently is using the Banias line to transport its own crude; the
Tripoli leg is believed to be in poor condition.
	   Oil experts have estimated that some dlrs 80-90 million are
required to repair the pipeline, which both countries have to seek
from foreign lenders. A new pipeline would require foreign
investors.
	   Under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program, Iraq may export
oil only via Turkey and its Gulf terminal at Mina al-Bakr. It would
require U.N. permission to use the Syrian channel. The United
Nations imposed trade sanctions after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   In February, the U.N. Security Council decided to allow Iraq to
increase the value of oil sales under the oil-for-food deal from
dlrs 2 billion every six months to dlrs 5.2 billion. The
oil-for-food deal is an exception from the U.N. sanctions.

Netanyahu snubs ceremony marking fifth anniversary of peace accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANNA HARMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Saying he is too busy to indulge in
``nostalgia,'' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will skip next
week's ceremony in Oslo marking the fifth anniversary of Israel's
breakthrough peace accord with the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu's decision drew criticism Thursday from the dovish
opposition and even his own coalition leader who said the prime
minister should have used the ceremony to try and renew contacts
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   ``It's a terrible mistake,'' former Prime Minister Shimon Peres
said of Netanyahu's snub. ``We owe our thanks to the people of
Norway.''
	   In 1993, Norway hosted the secret contacts between Israel and
the PLO that led to an agreement of mutual recognition and to a
framework agreement on Palestinian autonomy. The agreement was
finalized on Aug. 19-20 and was signed Sept. 13, 1993 in
Washington.
	   Peres, Arafat and U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross will attend
Sunday's anniversary ceremony in Norway.
	   As opposition leader, Netanyahu staunchly opposed the so-called
Oslo agreements, saying they posed a danger to Israel's existence.
When he became prime minister in 1996, Netanyahu said he would
honor Israel's commitments, but talks with the Palestinians over
Israeli withdrawals in the West Bank have stalled since March 1997.
	   Netanyahu's spokesman, Aviv Bushinsky, said the prime minister
was too busy to fly to Norway. ``The prime minister prefers to
remain in the country in an effort to advance the peace process...
and not deal in ceremonialism and nostalgia,'' Bushinsky said.
	   While it was clear that Netanyahu would stay home, there was
growing confusion Thursday over who would represent Israel in Oslo.
	   Bushinsky's statement said Netanyahu's political adviser, Uzi
Arad, would attend the ceremony, while Shetreet, the coalition
leader, said he was under the impression he would fly to Norway.
	   Shetreet said he was puzzled by Netanyahu's decision.
	   ``I cannot get into the prime minister's calculations, but I
think he should have been there,'' said Shetreet. ``Netanyahu and
Arafat need to meet in order to finalize the deal on withdrawal and
I don't see how else it can be done.''

Cambodia's election committee seeks an additional dlrs 1.3 million

 &UR; Eds: RESTORES `million' in overline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The body charged with overseeing
last month's parliamentary elections appealed to international
donors Thursday for an additional dlrs 1.3 million to help pay
staff salaries.
	   The National Election Committee said that even though it intends
to dramatically reduce its 15,000-strong staff by the end of the
month, 200 people will stay on through December ``to ensure the
continuity for future elections.''
	   The election cost nearly dlrs 40 million, the bulk of which was
paid by international donors, especially the European Union and
Japan.
	   Last month the United Nations Development Program gave the NEC
dlrs 1.6 from its Trust Fund. That money was immediately spent to
pay salaries for 58,495 staff workers who worked at polling and
counting stations nationwide, the NEC said.
	   Chhay Kim, the body's treasurer, said the NEC still needs some
employees to update voters' lists, prepare for next year's commune
elections, and begin work on the 1999 budget.
	   Cambodian leader Hun Sen's ruling party won a slight majority in
last month's polls, but the opposition has so far refused to
recognize the results until allegations of fraud are investigated.
	   The NEC rejected all but eight of 800 complaints about
irregularities in voting and ballot counting.
	   The elections were held one year after Hun Sen ousted Prince
Norodom Ranariddh as his co-premier in a violent coup, shattering a
tense dual premiership formed after the 1993 elections.
	   Hun Sen hoped the elections would help him to win back
legitimacy and aid lost after his violent takeover.

Some 50 die every day in Sudanese town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Some 50 people are dying of starvation
every day in a key southern Sudanese town, some in open areas and
abandoned homes because they cannot find shelter, a senior official
said.
	   Riak Machar, a former rebel commander now allied with the
government, said that in Wau ``a large number of people die in open
areas and in deserted houses because they cannot find shelter, and
this causes great damage to the public health situation.''
	   His remarks were reported Thursday in the independent daily,
Akhbar al-Sa'a.
	   Wau is the capital of the southern state of Bahr al-Ghazal,
where some 750,000 people face starvation.
	   The town is under government control, but rebels rule much of
the countryside.
	   Some 77,000 people have flooded into Wau, a town of about
100,000, since the start of the latest famine.
	   International aid agencies have estimated that 1.5 million
people are facing starvation across southern Sudan.
	   Some 1.5 million people have died from fighting and famine since
the start of the country's 15-year civil war. Southern rebels are
seeking greater autonomy for the predominantly African, Christian
and animist south from the Muslim and Arab north.

Arron likely to challenge American sprinting supremacy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in final two grafs with women's high jump, men's
steeplechase qualifying; will be updated about 1600 GMT with day's
first medal events &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The next challenge to the American
sprinting supremacy may come from a young French woman with
orange-dyed hair.
	   The color of her hair is not the only thing that distinguishes
Christine Arron. She also has tremendous acceleration.
	   The 24-year-old Guadeloupe native overcame a slow start to win
the women's 100 meters Wednesday at the European Championship,
setting a new continental record of 10.73 seconds.
	   That was just outside the 10.71 and 10.72 clocked by the U.S.
star and world champion Marion Jones. Jones has run each time twice
this year.
	   Both still have a lot to go before they can approach the world
record of 10.49 set by Florence Griffith-Joyner set in 1988.
	   ``Now I hope to improve more and stay healthy and do something
really nice next year at the worlds,'' Arron said.
	   If Arron is closing in on Jones, the European men are still way
behind the North Americans.
	   Darren Campbell led a 1-2 British finish in the men's 100,
clocking 10.04 seconds to set a championship record and a personal
best.
	   Campbell is coached by Linford Christie, the retired ace who had
won the last three European titles and the last European to
successfully battle the North Americans.
	   But Campbell was quick to issue a challenge.
	   ``I am No. 1 in Europe now. This is one of the stepping stones
that Linford and I have planned so that we can take on the
Americans seriously,'' the 24-year-old Briton said.
	   Arron trailed Irina Privalova of Russia, who had a flying start.
But with her powerful stride, Arron caught up with Privalova in the
last 20 meters and stole the title and the European record from the
Russian, who is coming off leg surgery.
	   ``It was a difficult race for me because Privalova had a very
good start,'' Arron said.
	   ``Halfway through the race I saw Privalova from the corner of my
eye and I accelerated between 60 and 80 meters,'' she said.
	   Privalova clocked 10.83 to win the silver in her fastest race
this year. Her 1994 record was 10.77.
	   Ekaterini Thanou of Greece won the bronze in 10.87 despite a
slow start and set a national record.
	   Arron's performance overshadowed the British triumph in the
men's dash.
	   Campbell, who once nearly quit track to take up soccer, edged
another upcoming British sprinter, Dwain Chambers, who took the
silver in 10.10. Charalambos Papadias of Greece won the bronze in
10.17.
	   ``Linford has prepared me brilliantly for this,'' Campbell said.
``I knew I was going to win it. I wasn't surprised I won and I
wasn't nervous out there, in fact I felt really cool. I knew after
I was in contention at 60 meters the race would be mine.
	   ``My start was a little bit dodgy but I knew I would be strong
at the end.
	   ``I was really pleased Dwain was second. We said in the call-up
room it would be a one-two, but we didn't know who would win,''
Campbell said.
	   Other gold medals of the day went to: Kiril Sosunov of Russia,
who cleared 8.28 meters to win men's long jump; Sonia O'Sullivan of
Ireland, in the women's 10,000 meters with a time of 31:29.33;
Tibor Gescek of Hungary in the men's hammer throw with a heave of
82.87; and Tanja Damaske of Germany in the women's javelin at
69.10.
	   In Thursday's 3,000-meter steeplechase semifinal, Italy's
Luciano Di Pardo clocked the top time of 8:26.52 followed by Marc
Ostendarp of Germany and Jim Svenoy of Norway, both in 8:26.92.
	   In the women's high jump qualifying, seven jumpers led the way
at 1.93 _ Russians Yelena Gulyayeva, Viktoriya Styopina, Viktoriya
Fyodorova, and Yulia Lyakhova, Poland's Donata Jancewicz, Austraian
Sigrid Kirchmann and Monica Dinescu of Romania.

	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ Standing before a dusty shrine to the
biblical figure Joseph, the Palestinian governor of Nablus declared
Thursday that he won't let dozens of Jewish settlers holed up
inside the compound leave unless they all go together.
	   Settlers responded that the group would not leave unless others
are allowed to take their place, Israel radio said.
	   The latest exchange signaled that efforts to negotiate an end to
the standoff are failing. Israeli opposition legislator Yossi Sarid
warned that the situation was becoming increasingly explosive.
	   Several dozen Jewish seminary students have been staying in the
Joseph's Tomb compound for the past two weeks, since coming to sit
shiva, or hold ritual mourning, for two seminary students killed at
a nearby settlement, Itzhar. Many of the mourners also live in
Itzhar.
	   The Palestinians initially agreed to let the seminary students
stay for a week, but after the mourning period was up, the group
remained in the compound. Palestinian police have besieged the
site, but have let trucks with food and supplies pass.
	   ``This situation will continue until they give in on their
position,'' Nablus governor Mahmoud Alool said Thursday.

Taiwan announces spending package to boost sagging economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan will increase government spending
by 70.9 billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 2.02 billion) over the
next 11 months in an effort to boost the sagging economy, Premier
Vincent Siew said Thursday.
	   Another 110 billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 3.1 billion) worth
of already-approved public projects will be accelerated to help
stimulate domestic market demand, said Siew.
	   The increased spending is expected to boost economic growth by
0.3 percent-0.7 percent in each of the next two years, officials
said.
	   ``This is a short-term measure aimed at helping us ride out the
regional economic crisis,'' Siew told a news conference.
	   The new spending package will include projects in
transportation, housing and infrastructure, said Chiang Pin-kung,
chairman of the Cabinet's Council for Economic Planning and
Development.
	   Taiwan's economy has been rocked by aftershocks from the
regional decline in currencies and stock markets, forcing the
government to revise its growth forecast for the year from 6
percent down to 5.3 percent.
	   Exports fell by 6.7 percent in the first four months of the
year, and in June the Taiwan dollar hit an 11-year low against the
U.S. currency.

<TEXT>
	   PAMPLONA, Spain (AP)_ Vandals believed linked to the armed
Basque separatist group ETA firebombed the house of a socialist
regional parliamentary deputy in what was the 19th such attack on
the politician.
	   Asun Apesteguia, a deputy in the Navarra regional parliament,
and her family were at home asleep when Molotov cocktail was fired
at her apartment damaging the outside of the building and her
husband's car parked outside, police said.
	   No one was injured in the incident.
	   Apesteguia has been targeted in 18 previous attack by gangs
linked by authorities to the armed separatist group ETA which has
killed nearly 880 people in a 30-year campaign for the independence
of the neighboring Basque region.
	   Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Apesteguia said her attackers
would not force to her to change her beliefs or those of the
Socialist party, which vehemently opposes ETA.
	   ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, believes much of Navarra, as well as areas in
southwestern France, should form part of its independent state.
	   The organization has killed seven politicians in the past three
years while its allied gangs regularly attack politicians' homes
during weekly sprees in Pamplona and Basque towns and cities.
	   On Tuesday, offices of the Basque National Party were firebombed
in the small Basque town of Amorebieta.

Italian soccer player throws water balloon, hurting two children

<TEXT>
	   NAPLES, Italy (AP) _ A day after a water balloon came hurtling
down from a Naples hotel room, crashing through a car windshield
and injuring two children, a player for Italy's first division
soccer league has said he was behind the prank.
	   ``It was an accident,'' Inter of Milan defender Fabio Galante
said Thursday on Italian television newscasts.
	   ``We were throwing balloons at each other and I was trying to
hit my teammates on the balcony, but the balloon ended up in the
streets and hit a car,'' Galante said.
	   An 11 and 12-year-old child who were in the passing car were
taken to the hospital for checkups. News reports said they had been
slightly injured.
	   Galante said he apologized to the children at the hospital and
promised to send them a jersey of his famous Brazilian teammate,
Ronaldo. But the family said it would sue Galante.
	   The incident occurred hours before Inter faced Naples in an
exhibition match whose profits were destined for hundreds of people
left homeless in Sarno, south of Naples, by the devastating
mudslides in May.

<TEXT>
	   TOWNSVILLE, Australia (AP) _ American adventurer Steve Fossett
was a little wiser when he stepped onto solid ground for the first
time Thursday since the plunge into the sea that ended his fourth
attempt to fly a balloon around the world.
	   ``It was a sobering experience,'' said the 54-year-old Chicago
millionaire who has also run marathons, climbed mountains and raced
dog sleds in Alaska. ``This is the closest I have come in my entire
life to being killed.''
	   Enough to make him think twice.
	   ``The consequences in this around-the-world ballooning are so
severe,'' he told a news conference soon minutes he was returned to
shore. ``I'm not sure I should keep doing it every year, taking
this risk.''
	   Fossett is one of an elite handful of people who for years have
been trying to beat each other to become the first person to go
around the world in a balloon. Others include the British
millionaire Richard Branson.
	   Fossett's dramatic plunge into the Coral Sea on Monday ended the
attempt that so far has come closest. He traveled two-thirds of the
Earth's circumference before becoming caught in a severe storm
which ruptured his balloon and sent him plummeting from a height of
almost 29,000 feet (9,000 meters) within ten minutes.
	   Frantic in the cramped capsule in which he had spent almost two
weeks since takeoff, Fossett on Thursday said his reaction when he
began his rapid descent was to say out loud: ``I am going to die.''
	   ``But I figured I would keep working on (fixing) the problem,
and did. All the way down,'' he said.
	   This included firing all the balloon's burners, causing them to
melt part of the canopy and going outside the protective capsule
during a severe buffeting and ``just sheets of hail'' to cut free
fuel and oxygen tanks which were weighing down the balloon.
	   He estimated the impact at a speed of 2,500 feet (750 meters)
per minute _ more than should be endurable. Fosset blacked out. His
next memory was ``waking up with the capsule upside down, half full
of water and on fire.''
	   Fossett scrambled into a liferaft and set off emergency beacons.
Within hours a French military plane from New Caledonia had found
him _ in reef-strewn and shark-infested waters about 500 miles (800
km) off Australia's east coast _ and ships had been diverted to
pick him up.
	   Early Tuesday, the Australian yacht Atlanta negotiated reefs
uncharted since the 1860s, picked him up and gave him a good meal.
He was later transferred to the New Zealand navy tanker Endeavour,
which delivered him Thursday to Townsville, Australia.
	   Fossett set out from Mendoza, Argentina, on Aug. 7. He traveled
more than 15,200 miles (24,461 kms) before the crash.
	   Fossett's first attempt to circle Earth lasted just 36 hours,
cut short in January 1996 by winter storms. A year later, he set
the balloon distance record: a 10,361-mile (16,580-kilometer)
journey from St. Louis, Missouri, to Sultanpar, India. He ran short
of fuel while awaiting Libyan clearance.
	   He took off from St. Louis on his third attempt this past New
Year's Eve. Five days later, he landed 5,802 miles (9,285
kilometers) away in a wheat field near Krasnodar, southern Russia.
	   Fossett's crash landing led to the sixth major rescue operation
in the seas surrounding Australia in recent years. Rescue costs,
which run into the millions of dollars, have been borne by
Australian taxpayers under international conventions covering
safety at sea.
	   There have been calls in recent years for ``contribution fees''
from around-the-world yacht race organizers, who receive hefty
commercial sponsorships, to help foot any rescue bills.
	   Fossett said he would consider contributing to his rescue only
if the governments of the nations involved approached him directly.
	   With the around-the-world ballooning in the northern hemisphere
season soon to start, and with his balloon submerged, Fossett has
no immediate chance of returning to the race, even if he wanted to.
	   Success is very close. He says one of the about six teams
expected to make an attempt this year will probably make it.

Grobbelaar signs-up in minor leagues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHESHAM, England (AP) _ Bruce Grobbelaar, the former Liverpool
and Southampton goalkeeper at the center of match-fixing
allegations last year, is back playing soccer for a semi-pro soccer
team in the English minor leagues.
	   The 40-year-old former Zimbabwean international, who was charged
with fixing Premier League matches for an Asian gambling syndicate,
was aquitted of the charges. But he was suspended from playing for
six months after admitting breaking Football Association rules by
forecasting results for the syndicate.
	   Grobbelaar was cleared to resume playing in December and was
reportedly approached to become Zimbabwean national coach in May.
Now he has emerged to play for Chesham United, where he is playing
for 200 pounds (dlrs 325) a match.
	   The former Premier League star, accustomed to playing in front
of huge crowds at Anfield, made his debut in the Buckinghamshire
club's 7-1 win over Brackley before a 100-strong crowd on Saturday.
	   Chesham manager Graham Roberts, a former England international,
said Grobbelaar ``just wanted to play football and we are really
pleased he has decided to join us.''
	   Dutch goalkeeper Hans Segers and former Wimbledon striker John
Fashanu also were charged along with Grobbelaar of match fixing but
also were cleared. Segers is currently with Tottenham but Fashanu
has retired because of injury.

Police arrest organizers of pro-unification rally
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Four people including a Protestant
church pastor were arrested Thursday on charges of organizing a
campus rally the government outlawed as pro-North Korean, police
said.
	   They were accused of leading a three-day festival at Seoul
National University last week, in which 2,500 students celebrated
the Aug. 15 anniversary of Korea's liberation from 1910-45 Japanese
colonial rule.
	   In the rally, they renewed their support for key North Korean
demands, including the withdrawal of 37,000 U.S. troops stationed
in South Korea.
	   The Rev. Kang Hee-nam, 78, is head of the South Korean chapter
of Pomminryon, or the National Alliance for the Country's
Reunification, which has sponsored pro-unification rallies in both
Koreas to celebrate Korean Independence Day.
	   The other three _ Lee Soo-yeon, Kim Yang-mo and Park Byong-joon
_ are also leaders of the same organization.
	   Government officials believed Pomminryon is a disguised
communist propaganda machine.
	   The four were accused of violating the South's anti-espionage
national security law that bans activities deemed as benefiting
communist North Korea.
	   Invoking the same law, South Korea sentenced Kang to three years
in prison in 1996 for establishing Pomminryon's South Korean
chapter. After serving 1 1/2 years, he was freed in a special
government amnesty in March.
	   Also Thursday, Seoul's main intelligence Agency for National
Security Planning questioned two Roman Catholic priests on charges
of engaging in political activities during their recent visit to
North Korea.
	   The Revs. Moon Kyu-hyon and Chun Jong-hoon were called in right
after their return home Wednesday from their week-long trip to the
North, agency officials said.
	   The two, along with seven other priests, were allowed to make
the visit on condition that they attend only religious functions
celebrating the Aug. 15 anniversary.
	   Moon and Chun broke their promise _ and the South's national
security law _ by paying tribute to the late North Korean President
Kim Il Sung lying in state in a Pyongyang palace, the agency said.
	   The priests were members of the South's Korean Catholic Priests'
Council for Justice, a human rights group.
	   Moon was convicted in 1990 of making an unauthorized visit to
North Korea and served three years of a five-year prison term
before being granted amnesty by the government.
	   No one from either North or South Korea can visit the other side
without approval from their governments, which is rarely given.
	   The Koreas have been bitter rivals since the division of their
peninsula into the communist North and the capitalist South in
1945. They fought a bloody three-year war in the early 1950s.

Intel to build a dlrs 1 billion plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The American electronics concern
Intel Corporation plans to build a computer processor plant worth
dlrs. 1 billion in the Czech Republic, public radio reported
Thursday.
	   The plant is to be built from scratch near the town of
Pardubice, 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Prague, and is to
employ up to 3,000 people. Annual turnover is provisionally planned
to range from dlrs one to four billion, with most of the production
aimed for exports.
	   Intel preferred the Czech Republic over Portugal and Egypt,
according to the media.
	   The Czechinvest agency, dealing with foreign investments in the
Czech Republic, refused to confirm Intel's venture, claiming it
doesn't have enough information on the company's plans, the Pravo
daily said Thursday.

Two oldies Drechsler and Jackson keyed up for Europeans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST. Hungary (AP) _ She's a former Olympic and world
champion, so you might think the European Championships have a low
priority for long jumper Heike Drechsler.
	   Not ever, and in particular _ not this year.
	   The 33-year-old German is coming off operations 10 months ago on
both Achilles tendons. She's healthy for the first time in three
years and on Saturday will try becoming only the third person to
win four straight Euro golds in one event.
	   ``This is a new challenge for me to come back after so many
problems,'' she said Thursday. ``I'm jumping over 7 meters again
and I'm back, really back.''
	   Drechsler has jumped 7.05 meters (23-1 3/4), the best jump in
the world this season behind American Marion Jones' 7.31 (23-11
3/4) and British-born Italian Fiona May's 7.08 (23 2 3/4).
	   ``I think it's not so important for me to think about records in
these championships,'' she said. ``I'm just trying to win it.''
	   Ask about her advanced age, she joked. ``I'm 28. I've lost my
passport.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ANOTHER OLDIE: &LR;  World 110 record-holder Colin Jackson skipped
prestigious and rich meets the last several weeks in Zurich and
Monte Carlo to focus only on the Europeans.
	   ``I wanted to concentrate only on this,'' said the Welshman.
``Quick races against the Americans (in Zurich and Monte Carlo)
would have been a distraction.''
	   Jackson, 31, a former world champion and two-time European
champion, is running as well as he has in five years and has
clocked 13.07, the best in Europe this season but well behind
American Allen Johnson's 12.98.
	   He's also been running the flat 100 meters to improve his speed
and running technique.
	   ``I haven't been able to run a sprint properly for several
years,'' he said. ``I think I've improved my sprinting posture and
it's helping my hurdling.
	   ``I'd be quite disappointed if I don't duck under that 13-second
barrier this weekend,'' he added.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   EURO WELCOME: &LR;  Now carrying a Danish passport _ the absence of
one kept him out of the 1996 Olympics _ Kenya-born Wilson Kipketer
is in his first European championships and looking to add to his
world 800 record and two world titles.
	   Kipketer was hospitalized for 10 days in February with malaria _
caught on a visit to Kenya _ and didn't start serious training
until late May. And it's shown.
	   Earlier this month in Zurich he was beaten by Kenyan Japheth
Kimutai, his first lost in almost 30 races.
	   ``I'm still the same person, but my running's not the same since
I had malaria,'' he said. He's run 1:43.18 and 1:43.74, well off
his world mark of 1:41.11 set last year.
	   ``My times are going forward, so that's progress for me,'' said
Kipketer, whose time is the best this season by a European.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW LINFORD: &LR;  Darren Campbell's gold Wednesday in the 100
(10.04) fulfilled a promise made six years ago when former world
and Olympic champion Linford Christie said Campbell was his heir.
	   But's it's been a long time coming.
	   ``Back then I believed what Linford was saying about me. Maybe I
didn't put in the work I needed to,'' said the 24-year-old
Campbell.
	   About five years ago he dropped out of sprinting to try soccer
and got a tryout with second-division English side Plymouth.
	   ``The guys eventually told me I was a better sprinter than a
footballer,'' he admitted. ``The guys encouraged me to go back.''

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Kenyans suffering physical and emotional
wounds ``from the day Satan visited Nairobi,'' prayed Thursday for
257 people killed in the terrorist bombings of two U.S. embassies
in East Africa.
	   Thousands of people wearing swatches of red ribbon as a sign of
mourning gathered on a grassy hill in downtown Uhuru Park to seek
peace and healing from the attacks Aug. 7 in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   ``It is the day Satan visited Nairobi,'' President Daniel arap
Moi said. The death tolls were 247 in Nairobi, and 10 in Dar es
Salaam.
	   While investigations into the twin attacks continued on several
fronts, a band of Islamic extremists warned of further strikes
against American interests.
	   FBI Director Louis Freeh toured the site of the bombed U.S.
Embassy in Dar es Salaam on Thursday and met with Tanzanian
officials and FBI agents handling the investigation there.
	   Two people remained in custody in Tanzania in connection with
the investigation, but Home Affairs Minister Ali Ameir Mohammed
would not give their names or nationalities.
	   ``We haven't made any conclusions that anybody being held here
is connected at this point to the bombing,'' Freeh told reporters.
	   FBI agent Kenneth Piernick, who heads the U.S. side of the
Tanzanian probe, said ``similarities of events'' strongly suggested
a link between the two bombings.
	   At the memorial service in Nairobi, the names of the hundreds
who died were read in batches of six, punctuated by murmurs of
``Lord have mercy'' from mourners beneath a steel-gray sky. A
trumpet soloist played ``Amazing Grace.''
	   U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell, no longer wearing the
bandages that had covered cuts she had suffered in the bombing,
delivered a heartfelt promise that American would help East
Africans through this difficult time.
	   ``Together we will dispel the shadows darkness, emerge from the
veils of grief, and create a brighter tomorrow,'' she said.
	   Both Kenya and Tanzania have pressed for compensation for damage
to lives and property. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
promised aid earlier this week, but did not specify an amount or a
deadline.
	   ``Evil doers left in their wake broken bodies, broken hearts and
broken hopes of too many people who have shown us nothing but
welcome and kindness,'' Bushnell said.
	   ``Evil doers also left in their wake anger, misunderstanding and
divisiveness. Evil doers have tried to conquer us but they will
not, they shall not.''
	   In Nairobi, FBI agents returned Wednesday to take pictures of a
hotel in a seedy downtown section a mile (half-kilometer) from the
U.S. Embassy. The hotel had been the scene of an FBI and Kenyan
detective raid the day before.
	   In Pakistan, two more people were being questioned Wednesday in
the bombings. The pair reportedly were named by a suspect with
alleged links to exiled Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden, whom
U.S. officials call a major sponsor of terrorism.
	   U.S. officials were rebuffed Wednesday in their efforts to get
to bin Laden, who lives in Afghanistan. The Taliban religious army,
which rules most of Afghanistan, said it would not hand him over
even if the United States had proof he was behind the bombings.
	   However, The New York Times on Thursday quoted Taliban spokesman
Wakil Ahmed Mutawakil as saying if the United States presented hard
evidence of bin Laden's involvement in the bombings, the Taliban
would ``talk to the U.S.'' about what to do about him.
	   A group reportedly founded by bin Laden _ the World Islamic
Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders _ issued a defiant
warning Wednesday in the respected London-based Arabic newspaper
al-Hayat.
	   ``The coming days will guarantee, God willing, that America will
face a black fate,'' the statement said. ``Strikes will continue
from everywhere, and Islamic groups will appear one after the other
to fight American interests.''
	   The Daily Nation, a Kenyan newspaper, reported that the FBI and
the Kenyan agents raided the Hilltop Hotel based on information
provided by Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, who was arrested in Pakistan on
the day of the bombings and returned Aug. 14 to Kenyan authorities.
	   The Daily Nation said a bomb containing 1,760 pounds (800 kilos)
of TNT was assembled over several days at the hotel under Odeh's
direction.
	   The paper also said police were holding three other people in
connection with the attack.
	   In Pakistan, a border official said a Saudi and a Sudanese were
being questioned about the bombings after being detained Saturday
at the Afghan border. The New York Times reported that Odeh had
identified the two men as accomplices.

Hong Kong talk show host in stable condition, doctors say

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A feisty talk show host who underwent six hours
of surgery after being attacked with a meat cleaver is in stable
condition and improving rapidly, doctors said Thursday.
	   Doctors said 52-year old Albert Cheng was in ``very stable and
satisfactory condition'' after being assaulted by two unidentified
men armed just before his morning broadcast Wednesday.
	   ``All vital signs are normal, but it will be some time before we
can assess whether his condition will give rise to any degree of
disability,'' said Dr. Yok Chao, chief executive of the Queen
Elizabeth Hospital.
	   Although still in intensive care, Chao said the popular talk
show host known for his scathing commentaries on politics and
government was ``very alert.''
	   On Thursday, police found a stolen mini-van, believed to have
been used by the assailants, who remained at large.
	   Radio Hong Kong reported that police were examining tapes of
past broadcasts in their search for a motive. Officers of the
organized crime bureau have yet to determine whether the
unidentified assailants, both in their 30s, were connected to the
triads, or Chinese gangs.
	   Cheng underwent nearly six hours of surgery to reconnect muscle,
bone, and nerve tissue. He sustained six cuts of up to nine inches
long, and was given more than five liters of blood.
	   Despite his liberal and often outrageous attacks on government
and civil servants, condemnation of the attack was widespread and
swift.
	   Speaking before the Australian Chamber of Commerce on Thursday,
Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa said attacks of this kind ``are
unacceptable and will not be tolerated.''
	   The Frontier political movement said that if Cheng was attacked
because of his commentaries, it would be ``a serious danger to Hong
Kong's freedom of news and speech.''
	   ``If a journalist is physically assaulted for performing his
duty ... it symbolizes an attack on the freedom of expression of
the community,'' the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor said in a
statement.
	   Reporters Sans Frontiers, an international group for press
freedom, also said in a statement the assailants deserve the
stiffest penalities if they were ``attempting to silence or
intimidate Mr. Cheng.''
	   An aviation engineer by training, Hong Kong-born Cheng emigrated
to Canada in 1968, reportedly disillusioned with the Cultural
Revolution taking place on the Chinese mainland. He returned to
Hong Kong in 1984 and launched the first Chinese-language Playboy,
among other magazines.
	   Cheng is especially popular among blue-collar workers, many of
whom enjoy venting their anger at the government on air. Time
Magazine named him one of the most influential people in the
territory last year.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan and Israel have agreed to bolster
their trade in food and livestock and to allow greater Jordanian
exports to the Palestinian territories, a Jordanian Agriculture
Ministry spokesman said Thursday.
	   The two states signed an agreement Tuesday which provides for
Jordan to export to Israel each year 50,000 tons of fresh
vegetables and fruits, 900 tons of olive oil, 300,000 livestock,
1,000 tons of white cheese and 1,000 tons of dried yogurt, said
spokesman Ibrahim Abu-Eteila.
	   It will be the first time that Israel has imported livestock
from Jordan.
	   Abu-Eteila said the accord did not specify what Jordan would
import from Israel.
	   The deal also aims to facilitate Jordanian agricultural trade
with the Palestinian territories. Jordan has accused Israel of
impeding such exchange through overly bureaucratic procedures at
the crossing points between Jordan and the West Bank.
	   The agreement is part of an overall economic cooperation and
trade protocol signed three years ago to boost ties in the wake of
the 1994 Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The price index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange
closed the trading week up 2.36 percent from last week at 2,136.8
points, the National Investments Co. said Thursday.
	   In a weekly report, the company said trading was selective and
focused on companies that posted good midyear results. Demand was
also high for stocks of the six companies from the United Arab
Emirates that are listed here.
	   Some 627.36 million shares changed hands this week, up 87.44
percent from the week before. The value of these stocks rose by
76.14 percent to 105.28 million dinars (dlrs 344.05 million).
	   Out of the 75 companies listed on the exchange, 63 were traded,
the report said. Fifteen closed higher, 22 closed lower and 26 were
unchanged.
	   ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Share prices slipped, but turnover
increased on the Amman stock exchange this week out of concern for
King Hussein, who is undergoing cancer treatment in the United
States, brokers said Thursday.
	   Activity was also sluggish because of the furor over polluted
drinking water in the posh suburbs of Amman, brokers added.
	   A stock market report, reflecting activity for five business
days ending Wednesday, said the 60-company general share prices
index fell by 0.64 percent to 182.42 points.
	   Shares of commercial banks dropped by 0.27 percent, industrial
firms by 1.71 percent, the services sector by 0.33 percent and
insurance companies by 1.10 percent.
	   Turnover increased by 65.8 percent to 7.61 million Jordanian
dinars (dlrs 10.71 million), the report said.
	   It said stocks of 101 firms were traded.

	   HARBIN, China (AP) _ Floods swamped part of China's largest oil
field Thursday, forced 100,000 people to flee nearby villages and
cut a railway line needed for bringing in relief supplies.
	   Thousands of soldiers struggled to fortify the 280 kilometers
(170 miles) of dikes surrounding the Daqing oil field in
northeastern China's Heilongjiang province. Experts warned the
waterlogged dikes were in ``critical condition,'' the China Daily
reported.
	   Vice Premier Wen Jiabao, under orders from Communist Party
leader Jiang Zemin, exhorted the soldiers, reminding them of the
stakes in fighting the floods.
	   ``At our backs are the crucial cities of the north _ Harbin,
Qiqihar _ and our country's greatest oil field, Daqing,'' Wen,
standing near a dike and using a bullhorn, told the soldiers
Wednesday according to a state television report Thursday.
	   In Harbin, the provincial capital 150 kilometers (100 miles) to
the southeast with 9 million residents, waters from the raging
Songhua River seeped through a makeshift dike of sandbags 2 meters
(6 feet) high. Nearby parks and roads were flooded.
	   On the north bank of the river, opposite the city, floods
covered fields and villages. Just the roofs of houses poked through
the waters.
	   Two diverging sets of train tracks on raised railbeds held back
the waters, saving a slice of dry land. Families of flooded-out
villagers moved into train cars parked on sidings. One couple,
their two small children and four cows camped atop a garbage dump.
	   Seasonal rains that have been heavier and began earlier than
usual have caused some of China's worst flooding in decades. More
than 2,000 people have died nationwide in flooding, and economic
losses are expected to reach dlrs 24 billion.
	   In central China along the Yangtze River, flood waters remained
at record heights between vast Dongting Lake and Wuhan, a major
industrial center, China Central Television reported.
	   Nine thousand soldiers rushed to repair leaks in dikes in Wuhan.
One million soldiers and civilians struggled to maintain
1,500-kilometer-long levees along the lake.
	   In the northeast, around Daqing oil field, floods on the Nen
River swamped the town of Xingzhan Tuesday and moved south. More
than 100,000 people living up to 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of
Xingzhan were being evacuated, the China Daily said.
	   More than 1,200 wells at Daqing were swamped, and 527 others
stopped production and floods were hampering oil pumping at another
major field in neighboring Jilin province, the People's Daily said.
	   Soldiers piled more sandbags on to a third embankment, the last
defense protecting Daqing city's 2.3 million people, CCTV reported.
	   Floods on Wednesday destroyed a railway line near Daqing, where
China gets more than one-third of its domestic oil supply. A rush
repair team of 400 people was working to open the line to get
relief supplies in, the Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   The Nen also flooded parts of Inner Mongolia. Prisoners in
low-lying parts of that area leaned out of windows yelling for help
before they were evacuated from six prisons, the Legal Daily
reported.
	   The Ministry of Civil Affairs made an urgent appeal for warm
clothing, tents and blankets for flood victims in the northeast.
	   The government-controlled news media has given little
information about flood damage or deaths, and instead has been
ordered to play up flood fighting efforts.
	   The floods are ``binding the nation together and bringing to
life the most essential things that define us as a nation,'' an
editorial in China Daily said Thursday.
	   ``Together we resisted and foiled the most atrocious of foreign
aggressions; together we survived the most tragic economic and
political turmoils in history,'' it said, adding: ``Hand in hand we
are an impregnable embankment against the floods.''

Kiriyenko: devaluation, debt restructuring needed to stave off
</HEADLINE>
default &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with figures of amount of money commercial banks owe
foreigners, TRIMS pvs. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's devaluation of the ruble and suspension
of debt payments was a last-ditch effort to avoid a full default,
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said Thursday.
	   ``If we were to continue servicing our debt and making payments
on treasury bills we would be unable to pay wages and pensions,''
Kiriyenko said in remarks broadcast by Russian television.
	   Kiriyenko scheduled a meeting with foreign investors later on
Thursday. He said they were working on a compromise debt payment
schedule.
	   ``We're not going to refuse to return this money to them, but
act together to calmly and thoroughly analyze the real
opportunities we have,'' the prime minister told the Cabinet.
	   Russia's financial crisis deepened this month as stocks fell
sharply and investors fled Russian bonds en masse even though
interest rates soared to 200 percent.
	   The Central Bank acknowledged Thursday that Russia's hard
currency reserves fell sharply in the days before the devaluation
was announced, falling nearly dlrs 2 billion last week _ from dlrs
17 billion as of Aug. 7 to dlrs 15.1 billion last Friday.
	   The government has continually failed to pay wages and pensions
to millions of Russians, sparking protests in several regions.
	   Kiriyenko said a suspension of payments on treasury bills would
add between 200 and 250 billion rubles (dlrs 29 and 36 billion) to
state coffers over the next 18 months that would help pay back
wages.
	   Unpaid wages grew by 6.5 percent in July and stood at 75.8
billion rubles (around dlrs 11 billion) as of the beginning of this
month, but only 20 percent of that is owed by the state.
	   The government had initially planned to announce the terms of
debt restructuring on Wednesday but postponed it until Monday under
pressure from foreign investors who feared that Russia was going to
offer them a worse deal than Russian banks. Those terms were
believed to be the top agenda item for Kiriyenko's session with the
investors.
	   The Central Bank said Thursday that Russian commercial banks
owed non-residents dlrs 19.2 billion as of July 1.
	   Meanwhile, the ruble's value remained virtually unchanged
Thursday at the Moscow currency exchange controlled by the Central
Bank which sets the official exchange rate, falling to 6.995 from
6.99.
	   The government has decided to allow the ruble to sink as low as
9.5 to the dollar, but is hoping that it will shortly stabilize at
around 7. Most bankers share this forecast and street rates for
selling dollars, which plunged to 9.5 and below earlier this week,
has stabilized around 7.5 to 8 at booths around Moscow on Thursday.
	   A longer-term forecast would strongly depend on the government's
stabilization efforts and the position of Russian commercial banks,
many of which are now in trouble because of over-dependence on
ruble assets.
	   Moving to avert panic, Central Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin
assured Russians that their bank deposits were ``100 percent''
safe. He also urged Russia's commercial banks to create a system of
mutual guarantees on all deposits.
	   In a bid to vent popular anger over the painful moves, the
government established a hot line for Russians to report unfair
price hikes and make their proposals on how to overcome the crisis.
The tax police have promised to crack down on businesses that
unfairly crank up consumer prices.
	   The government on Thursday also discussed next year's draft
budget which is now being recalculated.
	   Kiriyenko said the government would proceed from the most
pessimistic scenario, assuming that world prices for oil and
natural gas _ Russia's main exports _ would remain low.

Ralf Schumacher in talks about joining Williams team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEUSS, Germany (AP) _ Ralf Schumacher, younger brother of
two-time auto racing champion Michael, is in talks with Formula One
team Williams about a four-year deal, his spokesman said Thursday.
	   Schumacher manager Willi Weber denied newspaper reports,
however, that a contract had already been signed at last weekend's
Hungarian Grand Prix.
	   He said it was impossible because of a clause in Schumacher's
contract with the Jordan team, which he is committed to until the
end of the season.
	   ``Absolutely nothing will happen before the end of August,''
Weber said.
	   A Williams spokeswoman said the team would not be making any
statements about new drivers until at least mid-September.
	   Schumacher likely will replace fellow German driver,
Heinz-Harald Frentzen, whose contract with Williams runs out this
year and has not been renewed.
	   BMW begins supplying engines for Williams in 2000 and has
reportedly asked for a German driver in the team.
	   Williams also is losing Jacques Villeneuve of Canada, the
reigning champion, who is going to the new BAR team,
British-American Racing.

Yeltsin commemorates 30th anniversary of ``Prague Spring''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday recalled the
``Prague Spring'' as an attempt ``to escape from ideological
dogmatism and lies.''
	   ``But even shy attempts of reform called down terror from those
who wanted to preserve the totalitarian system,'' Yeltsin said in a
telegram to the Congress of Russian Intelligentsia.
	   More than 100 people were killed after Soviet tanks barreled
into Prague on Aug. 21, 1968, to halt nine months of reforms _
including free speech _ never before seen in the Soviet bloc.
	   In the telegram, Yeltsin put a new face on the reformed Russia.
``We do not threaten anyone or enforce our will,'' he wrote.
	   He also obliquely marked the anniversary of the Aug. 18-21,
1991, attempted coup against Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, in
which he played a key role in resisting coup forces.
	   ``We must remember the work of those days,'' the telegram read.
``And Russians, protecting democracy in August of 1991, proved:
There is no power that can stop the drive of the people towards
democracy.''

Family of slain journalist seeks longer sentences for policemen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AFYON, Turkey (AP) _ The family of a slain Turkish journalist
demanded the longest possible prison sentences Thursday for the
policemen accused of beating him to death.
	   In March, the five officers were sentenced to 7 1/2 years in
prison after being convicted of kicking, punching and clubbing
27-year-old Metin Goktepe. Goktepe died in custody on Jan. 9, 1996.
	   An appeals court ordered a retrial last month, saying the first
court had failed to gather all the necessary testimony and
information.
	   Lawyers for Goktepe's family said the policemen should get the
maximum sentence of 15 years in prison.
	   The case is viewed as a test of the government's promise to
crack down on abuses by Turkey's security forces.
	   In the initial trial, the policemen claimed Goktepe's death was
accidental and said he died after falling off a wall and hitting
his head.
	   His body was found in an Istanbul park a day after he and
hundreds of other people were detained during a mass funeral for
prisoners killed in jail riots. He was covering the funeral for a
left-wing daily, Evrensel.
	   Six other police officers acquitted in the first trial were also
being retried, but the court refused to put them under arrest,
private television NTV said.
	   The trial, held in the central Anatolian city of Afyon, was
adjourned until Sept. 17.

Taiwan activists demand scrapping of ban on direct shipping with
</HEADLINE>
China &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Activists who defied a Taiwanese
government ban by sailing directly to China said Thursday that
restrictions on contacts with the mainland are impractical and
should be scrapped.
	   Taiwan has maintained a prohibition on direct shipping, commerce
and communications with China for nearly 50 years.
	   The ban is inconvenient and expensive for Taiwanese, especially
those on the front-line island groups of Kinmen, also known as
Quemoy, and Matsu, said the co-leader of the expedition, Taipei
county counselor Kin Chieh-shou.
	   Kin arrived at Xiamen port in China's Fujian province on
Wednesday on board a fishing boat with nine other activists and
spoke with The Associated Press by cellular phone on Thursday.
	   The government has declared the trip illegal and threatened to
punish the activists with fines up to 15 million Taiwan dollars
(U.S. dlrs 4288,000) and sentences of up to three years in prison.
	   Taiwanese boats, however, are already such a common sight in
Fujian that Xiamen set up a customs booth for Taiwanese visitors
nine years ago, issuing landing visas to anyone who can show a
Taiwanese identity card, Kin said.
	   ``The law discriminates against the ordinary people of Taiwan
and should be abolished,'' Kin said.
	   Tsao Yuan-chang, a National Assembly deputy from Matsu who
co-led the trip, said the group advocated lifting the ban on links
between the front-line islands and China as a first step.
	   Tsao said that the Chinese coast can be seen from Matsu, but in
order to get there legally, travelers have to fly to Taipei, drive
to the international airport, and fly to Hong Kong.
	   Such a trip can take days and costs more than 20,000 Taiwan
dollars (U.S. dlrs 571), Tsao said.
	   Kin and Tsao belong to the minor opposition New Party, which
strongly favors Taiwan's reunification with China and draws much of
its support from Chinese immigrants who fled here with Chiang
Kai-shek's defeated Nationalists in 1949.
	   Originally intended to isolate China, the ban on direct links
has evolved into a defense against economic dependency on the
mainland and as a bargaining chip for use in future negotiations
with Beijing.
	   But the ban has come under increasing criticism as marriage,
trade and investment ties grow.
	   Taiwanese fishing boats and other vessels are known to routinely
violate the direct navigation ban by smuggling goods and illegal
aliens between the sides.

Mubarak discusses peace, economic cooperation with U.S. Senator
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ President Hosni Mubarak met Thursday with
U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel for talks on the Middle East peace process
and economic cooperation.
	   Hagel, R-Neb, serves as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on
International Economic Policy, Export and Trade Promotion _ and is
also on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
	   Richard Brown, head of the U.S. Agency for International
Development in Egypt, also attended the meeting with Mubarak in the
Mediterranean port city of Alexandria.
	   Hagel told reporters that his country would like to increase
economic cooperation with Egypt, but added that the issue of U.S.
aid to Egypt was not discussed.
	   Egypt is a major trading partner of the United States in the
Middle East.
	   Hagel said it was in the interest of all countries to see the
Mideast peace process advance and that lack of trust among the
parties hindered progress.
	   ``The U.S. will continue to play a big role'' in the peace
process, Hagel said.
	   Talks between the two sides are stalled over a U.S. proposal
that calls for an Israeli withdrawal from an additional 13 percent
of Palestinian land in the West Bank. Israel says it will only pull
out of 9 per cent of the West Bank.
	   Hagel, who arrived here from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, is
scheduled to leave for Lebanon on Friday. His Mideast tour will
also take him to Syria and Saudi Arabia.

Chechen police search in vain for abducted Yeltsin's envoy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Officials in the breakaway republic of Chechnya
have tried, but failed, to free President Boris Yeltsin's envoy to
the region who was kidnapped nearly four months ago, a news agency
said Thursday.
	   Chechnya's anti-abduction squad raided the town of Suruta in the
southern Shatoi region on Wednesday where they believed Valentin
Vlasov was held, but did not find him, spokesman Shadid Bargishev
said, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Vlasov was kidnapped at gunpoint May 1. No one has claimed
responsibility for the kidnapping.
	   Hundreds of people have been kidnapped in Chechnya and
surrounding regions, usually for ransom, since the region's
two-year war for independence from Russia ended in 1996.
	   About 50 people, including two Britons and many other foreigners
are still being held.
	   In their raid Wednesday, Chechen officials freed a Russian man
who was being held for dlrs 500,000 ransom.

Palestinian man arrested for killing his three preschool sons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TULKAREM, West Bank (AP) _ A man stabbed his three young sons _
ages 1, 3 and 5 _ to death early Thursday in an apparent dispute
involving his two wives, Palestinian authorities said.
	   Abdel Lateef Bedo, 50, was under arrest in the northern West
Bank city of Tulkarem.
	   Tulkarem Governor Izzedine Sharif said Bedo came to the city
police station Thursday morning carrying a knife and told police,
``I killed my children.''
	   Bedo, who worked in Israel as a laborer, lived with his two
wives and their children in a small house in the Tulkarem refugee
camp, and there was apparently a conflict between the two wives,
Sharif said.
	   On Wednesday night, Bedo beat the mother of the three boys and
kicked her out of the house, Sharif said.
	   Bedo's other wife and their three daughters, who range from 16
to 26, were also detained for questioning.
	   A neighbor said Bedo was frequently drunk.
	   Polygamy is permitted among Muslims living in the West Bank.

European Holocaust insurance claims could exceed dlrs 1 billion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writere &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Claims on European insurance companies for
policies sold to Jews who later died in the Holocaust could pass
the dlrs 1 billion mark, a leading U.S. insurance official said
Thursday.
	   Deborah Senn, insurance commissioner for Washington state, told
a news conference in Jerusalem that a dlrs 100 million settlement
reached Wednesday in New York between the Italian insurer
Assicurazioni Generali and Jewish organizations was only a
beginning and did not define the company's total debt to the
survivors and heirs.
	   Senn serves on a nine-member task force negotiating with
European insurance companies on the settlement of the claims.
	   She said the debt of Generali and the other European insurance
companies could not be calculated until they all agreed to make
their records public.
	   ``The hundred million (dollars) was a floor,'' she said. ``It is
my belief that these claims could easily be within the billion
dollar range or more.''
	   The task force, which represents the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners, is trying to persuade the European
companies to sign a memorandum of understanding to establish an
international commission to oversee the claims.
	   So far, only the Zurich Insurance Company has signed, Senn said.
	   A senior Israeli official, who was also at the news conference,
called on all the others to sign and to make their records public.
	   Bobby Brown, diaspora affairs adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, said some of the heirs did not even know the policies
existed because the companies still refuse to publish the names.
``The time has come to let in the light of day,'' he said.
	   Brown said the New York agreement was ``a step forward.''
	   Until recently, Generali refused to honor any of the policies
sold in Eastern Europe before Wordld War II on the grounds that its
assets there were nationalized by the post-war communist
governments.
	   Generali, which held a very large share of the pre-war Jewish
insurance market in Eastern Europe, at first denied that it
possessed the records of the policies sold there.
	   Recently, however, Generali provided all the names of the policy
holders to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial institute in
Jerusalem. The information was provided for historical research
only and on condition it not be made available to the public, said
Yad Vashem's chairman, Avner Shalev.
	   Shalev said Generali provided nearly names of 300,000 people,
most of them of Jews, including many who perished in the Holocaust.
	   Brown said such a large number of policies is almost certainly
worth much more than dlrs 100 million, but he stressed that Israel
will not talk in terms of any sum until all the records are made
public.
	   Among the major European insurance companies which have not yet
signed the memorandum are Allianz of Germany, Der Anker of Austria,
the French company AXA, the Swiss company Winthertur and Austria
Collegitat, said Senn.
	   Senn implied that it would be difficult for the European to
operate in the United States unless they meet the claims.
	   Most of the European companies have subsidiaries in the United
States, and she said the commissioners are committed to making sure
that the parent companies honour the policies of the Holocaust
victims and their heirs.
	   ``That is why they are licensed to do business in our states.
... to pay their claims when the time comes,'' she said.

Palestinian police capture two escaped prisoners
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more escapes in 3rd graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian security forces on
Thursday captured two Palestinian prisoners, including the killer
of an Israeli taxi driver, who had escaped the day before, a senior
official said.
	   The escape came only days after a leader of the Islamic militant
group Hamas, Imad Awadallah, fled from a Jericho lockup, setting
off a massive manhunt during which the desert oasis was put under
curfew for a day.
	   A Palestinian security source, meanwhile, said two other
prisoners escaped Wednesday from a jail in the northern West Bank
town Jenin. The two men, who had been serving life sentences for
killing a collaborator with Israel and his cousin, escaped after
they were allowed to sleep in the jail yard because of the heat,
the source said.
	   The recent escapes have embarrassed Palestinian security forces
and raised Israeli suspicions that the prisoners had inside help in
getting away.
	   The Israeli government has long claimed that the Palestinian
Authority is lax in dealing with Islamic militants and security
prisoners, a charge denied by Palestinian officials.
	   One of the prisoners captured Thursday, Iyad Abu Sabab, was
serving 15 years for killing an Israeli taxi driver in a botched
robbery last year, Palestinian security officials said.

Ukrainian officials seek to limit ruble circulation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's Economics Ministry has worked out
a plan to protect the country's economy following Russia's ruble
crisis and is advising businesses to limit their ruble
transactions, an official said Thursday.
	   Deputy Economics Minister Leonid Mynin refused to disclose
details of the plan, saying it covered ``the whole spectrum of
relations with Russia.''
	   But he said the ministry was recommending Ukrainians do business
in foreign currencies instead of rubles, ``and to sign revised
contracts with their Russian partners urgently.''
	   Most businesses were complying, Mynin said.
	   Ukraine also might seek to restructure its debt to Russia
because of losses suffered when the ruble was effectively devalued
by more than one-third this week, he said in remarks cited by the
Interfax news agency.
	   Russia is Ukraine's main economic partner and accounted for 32
percent of its total exports in 1997.
	   Ukrainian officials have voiced concerns that Russia's ruble
devaluation might undermine the stability of Ukraine's hryvna
currency and cause more foreign investors to leave the country's
shaky financial markets.
	   The hryvna slipped from 2.1435 to the U.S. dollar last week to
2.225 on Wednesday. There was no dollar trade at the interbank
currency exchange on Thursday.
	   The government and the National Bank said in a statement
Wednesday that Ukraine's market conditions were substantially
different from those in Russia and vowed to protect the country's
economy and currency.
	   ``There are no grounds for panic,'' said Mynin.

New airport to handle all air cargo for first time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's troubled new airport on Monday will
start handling all air cargo moving through the territory for the
first time since it opened in early July, the main cargo handler
said Thursday.
	   Serious computer and mechanical glitches at the new airport had
crippled air cargo transport, forcing Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals
to move parts of the operation back to the old airport.
	   A company statement said the new cargo terminal will process all
cargo transport starting Monday, eight days ahead of the schedule
set arranged by the cargo handler and the government.
	   ``With the early completion of the recovery program, we will be
well-prepared for the start of Hong Kong's peak period for cargo
handling'' in September, Anthony Charter, the company's managing
director, said in a statement.
	   Air cargo services have been back to normal levels since last
Friday using both airports, but officials said the lengthy partial
ban might have cost the territory 0.35 percent of this year's gross
domestic product.
	   Cathay Pacific Airways, which reported earlier this year its
first ever loss, said the cargo problems cost it 250 million Hong
Kong dollars (dlrs 32 million) in revenue in July alone.
	   The airport problems sparked serious public criticism of both
government officials and Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals. The company
said it was under extreme pressure from officials to open even
before it was ready.
	   Three separate investigations are under way to find out what
went wrong and who was responsible.

	   TULKAREM, West Bank (AP) _ A man stabbed his three young
children _ ages 1, 3 and 5 _ to death early Thursday in an apparent
dispute between his wife and ex-wife, Palestinian authorities said.
	   Abdel Lateef Bedo, 50, was under arrest in the northern West

ex-wife, and the children of both women in a two-bedroom house in
the Tulkarem refugee camp, neighbors said. Since the former wife
moved in last year after losing her job and house, the two women
were constantly fighting, neighbor Hussein Johar said.
	   After a fight between the two women on Wednesday, the wife left
the house and did not return until Thursday morning.
	   Bedo's former wife and three of her daughters, who range from 16
to 26, were also arrested for questioning.
	   Another neighbor, Ibrahim Hemidan, said Bedo's 5-year-old son
had been stabbed in the face and chest, and his daughters, ages 3

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The most senior leader ensnared in a crackdown on
rampant official graft on Thursday lost his appeal against a
16-year prison sentence for his part in China's biggest corruption
scandal.
	   The Supreme People's Court upheld the sentence handed down to
Chen Xitong, a former mayor and Communist Party chief of Beijing,
by a lower court on July 31 after a secret trial, the state-run
Xinhua News Agency said.
	   Appeals are rarely successful in China, and after the Supreme
People's Court decision, Chen has no other chances for redress.
	   A panel of high court judges heard statements from Chen and his
lawyer, questioned the former power broker and reviewed the trial
court's findings before rejecting the appeal, Xinhua said.
	   The high court noted what Xinhua called Chen's ``criminal acts
of corruption'' _ accepting expensive gifts and using public funds
to build luxury villas for his own use.
	   In footage shown on the nationwide evening news broadcast, Chen
stood and scowled as the head of the five-judge appeals panel read
its decision.
	   Chen's former colleagues in the Communist Party want to make an
example of him to demonstrate their determination to stamp out
rampant official corruption that has undermined the government's
legitimacy in the eyes of many Chinese.
	   Chen, 68, was the highest ranked official caught in a
five-year-old government anti-corruption campaign in which hundreds
of thousands of officials have been investigated and many,
including Chen's son, have been jailed.
	   ``Chen Xitong's severe breach of party discipline and national
laws and his serious penalty fully proves our party and government
will punish corrupt elements,'' the party newspaper People's Daily
said in an editorial to be published Thursday and read aloud on
state television Wednesday night.
	   ``This also proves our party can rely on its own strength to rid
itself of the insects corroding the party's flesh,'' the editorial
said.
	   Before his disgrace, Chen was one of 20 members of the Communist
Party's elite Politburo, the apex of Chinese political power. He
was the highest party official to face criminal prosecution since
the notorious Gang of Four were tried for political crimes
following the calamitous 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
	   Chen was brought down in a massive graft scandal that may have
cost Beijing as much as 18.3 billion yuan (more than dlrs 2
billion).
	   Some Chinese dissidents had called for Chen to be executed for
his crimes. Two dissidents who believed Chen got off lightly with a
16-year sentence also launched a signature drive to have him
retried in open, televised proceedings.

Social Democrats pledge to undo reforms of Kohl era if elected

	   BERLIN (AP) _ Social Democratic candidate Gerhard Schroeder
pledged Thursday to swiftly undo Chancellor Helmut Kohl's key
pension and wage reforms if elected while implementing a tax reform
of his own to spur the economy and reduce unemployment.
	   Seeking to counter persistent criticism from Kohl's camp that
the Social Democrats were vague on what they would do if elected,
Schroeder outlined a program for the first 100 days of a new Social
Democratic government.
	   Calling Kohl's promise to cut personal and corporate taxes by 30
billion marks (dlrs 17 billion) ``untenable,'' Schroeder pledged
gradual cuts of his own that would total a third of that.
	   He also promised renewed efforts to cut unemployment by opening
dialogue between employers, unions and the government.
	   ``There aren't any unrealistic promises,'' Schroeder told a news
conference. ``But we will begin to tackle things.''
	   Critics in Kohl's government assailed the program as disastrous.
	   Peter Hintze, general secretary of Kohl's Christian Democrats,
warned that repealing reforms Kohl has pushed through on sick pay,
pensions and restrictions on firing workers would be ``stomping on
the seedlings of recovery.''
	   ``These reforms were a bitter medicine but they had an effect,''
he said.
	   But Schroeder said reversing those reforms as part of his 100
day program would cost 1.5 billion marks (dlrs 830 million), only
0.3 percent of the federal budget.
	   And the benefits from stronger economic growth and lower
unemployment would more than offset the costs, he insisted.
	   Chances for a Social Democratic victory are the best since the
war, Schroeder said, pointing to a ``solid lead'' in polls of three
to five percentage points over Kohl's conservative union.

	   TOWNSVILLE, Australia (AP) _ American adventurer Steve Fossett
was a little wiser when he stepped onto solid ground for the first
time Thursday since the plunge into the sea that ended his fourth
attempt to fly a balloon around the world.
	   ``It was a sobering experience,'' said the 54-year-old Chicago
millionaire who has also run marathons, climbed mountains and raced
dog sleds in Alaska. ``This is the closest I have come in my entire
life to being killed.''
	   Enough to make him think twice.
	   ``The consequences in this around-the-world ballooning are so
severe,'' he told a news conference soon after returning to shore.
``I'm not sure I should keep doing it every year, taking this
risk.''
	   Fossett is one of a handful of people who for years have been
trying to become the first to go around the world in a balloon.
Others include the British millionaire Richard Branson.
	   Fossett's dramatic plunge into the Coral Sea on Monday ended the
attempt that so far has come closest. He traveled two-thirds of the
Earth's circumference before becoming caught in a severe storm
which ruptured his balloon and sent him plummeting from a height of
almost 29,000 feet (9,000 meters) within ten minutes.
	   Frantic in the cramped capsule in which he had spent almost two
weeks since takeoff, Fossett on Thursday said his reaction when he
began his rapid descent was to say out loud: ``I am going to die.''
	   ``But I figured I would keep working on (fixing) the problem,
and did. All the way down,'' he said.
	   This included firing all the balloon's burners, causing them to
melt part of the canopy and going outside the protective capsule
during a severe buffeting and ``just sheets of hail'' to cut free
fuel and oxygen tanks which were weighing down the balloon.
	   He estimated the impact at a speed of 2,500 feet (750 meters)
per minute _ more than should be endurable. Fosset blacked out. His
next memory was ``waking up with the capsule upside down, half full
of water and on fire.''
	   Fossett scrambled into a liferaft and set off emergency beacons.
Within hours a French military plane from New Caledonia had found
him _ in reef-strewn and shark-infested waters about 500 miles (800
km) off Australia's east coast _ and ships had been diverted to
pick him up.
	   Early Tuesday, the Australian yacht Atlanta negotiated reefs
uncharted since the 1860s, picked him up and gave him a good meal.
He was later transferred to the New Zealand navy tanker Endeavour,
which delivered him Thursday to Townsville, Australia.
	   Fossett set out from Mendoza, Argentina, on Aug. 7. He traveled
more than 15,200 miles (24,461 kms) before the crash.
	   Fossett's first attempt to circle Earth lasted just 36 hours,
cut short in January 1996 by winter storms. A year later, he set
the balloon distance record: a 10,361-mile (16,580-kilometer)
journey from St. Louis, Missouri, to Sultanpar, India. He ran short
of fuel while awaiting Libyan clearance.
	   He took off from St. Louis on his third attempt this past New
Year's Eve. Five days later, he landed 5,802 miles (9,285
kilometers) away in a wheat field near Krasnodar, southern Russia.
	   Fossett's crash landing led to the sixth major rescue operation
in the seas surrounding Australia in recent years. Rescue costs,
which run into the millions of dollars, have been borne by
Australian taxpayers under international conventions covering
safety at sea.
	   There have been calls in recent years for ``contribution fees''
from around-the-world yacht race organizers, who receive hefty
commercial sponsorships, to help foot any rescue bills.
	   Fossett said he would consider contributing to his rescue only
if the governments of the nations involved approached him directly.
	   With the around-the-world ballooning in the northern hemisphere
season soon to start, and with his balloon submerged, Fossett has
no immediate chance of returning to the race, even if he wanted to.
	   Success is very close. He says one of the about six teams
expected to make an attempt this year will probably make it.

	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ Standing before a dusty shrine to the
biblical figure Joseph, the Palestinian governor of Nablus declared
Thursday that he won't let dozens of Jewish settlers holed up
inside the compound leave unless they all go together.
	   Settlers responded that the group would not leave unless others
are allowed to take their place, Israel radio reported.
	   The latest exchange signaled that efforts to negotiate an end to
the standoff are failing.
	   Several dozen Jewish seminary students have been staying in the
Joseph's Tomb compound for the past two weeks, since coming to sit
shiva, or hold ritual mourning, for two seminary students killed at
a nearby settlement, Itzhar. Many of the mourners also live in
Itzhar.
	   The Palestinians initially agreed to let the seminary students
stay for a week, but after the mourning period was up, the group
remained in the compound. Palestinian police have blocked the site,
but have let trucks with food and supplies pass.
	   ``This situation will continue until they give in on their
position,'' Nablus governor Mahmoud Alool said Thursday.
	   Yigal Amitai, a settler leader from Itzhar, said Alool did not
have authority over the tomb, which is under Israeli control even
though it is in Palestinian-ruled Nablus. ``They should remember
that the Israelis control the land around their land, and we will
also take action.''
	   Earlier Thursday, Palestinians in black masks burned an effigy
of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a demonstration in
Nablus against Israel's control over Jerusalem. About 250 people
took part, holding banners that said ``Ending the Occupation is Our
Sacred Duty'' and ``Break the roadblocks around Jerusalem.''
	   The Palestinians want to establish a future capital in east
Jerusalem, which Israel captured in 1967, but Israel says it will
never relinquish sovereignty over any of the city.

European Holocaust insurance claims could exceed dlrs 1 billion

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with insurance commissioner saying the insurance
claims could exceed the dlrs 1.25 billion settlement with Swiss
banks on dormant war-era bank accounts.
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writere &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Claims on European insurance companies for
policies sold to Jews who later died in the Holocaust could pass
the dlrs 1 billion mark, a leading U.S. insurance official said
Thursday.
	   Deborah Senn, insurance commissioner for Washington state, told
a news conference in Jerusalem that a dlrs 100 million settlement
reached Wednesday in New York between the Italian insurer
Assicurazioni Generali and Jewish organizations was only a
beginning and did not define the company's total debt to the
survivors and heirs.
	   Senn serves on a nine-member task force negotiating with
European insurance companies on the settlement of the claims.
	   She said the debt of Generali and the other European insurance
companies could not be calculated until they all agreed to make
their records public.
	   ``The hundred million (dollars) was a floor,'' she said. ``It is
my belief that these claims could easily be within the billion
dollar range or more.''
	   Senn said a final settlement could eventually exceed the dlrs
1.25 billion Swiss banks have agreed to pay heirs for dormant
war-era accounts. ``Everything we have seen thus far would suggest
that the insurance damanges are even higher than the Swiss bank
accounts,'' she said.

Slovakia has two army chiefs of staff
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Slovakia currently has two chiefs of
staff of the Army: one who wants to step down and the other
appointed contrary to existing law.
	   Gen. Jozef Tuchyna, Slovakia's Army chief of staff, first asked
to be released from his post because he wants to run in
parliamentary elections next month.
	   The chairman of the Slovak parliament, Ivan Gasparovic,
dismissed Tuchyna from his job and appointed a new chief of staff
on Wednesday but apparently disregarded the legally required
procedure.
	   According to the Slovak law, the new chief of staff has to be
named by the defense minister, Jan Sitek, who is on vacation until
Saturday.
	   However, the new chief of staff appointed by Gasparovic, Marian
Miklus, was nominated by Premier Vladmir Meciar, not the defense
minister.
	   Reacting to the move, Tuchyna told independent Radio Twist on
Thursday that ``I am forced to stay in office because this (new)
chief of staff was appointed against the law.
	   ``Those who will not listen to my orders will have to face the
consequences,'' he added.
	   Meanwhile, Meciar, the premier, said that Miklus was recommended
to him by the state secretary at the Defense Ministry. But state
secretary Jozef Gajdos told reporters on Thursday that he ``made no
suggestions to the prime minister.''
	   Anna Malikova, the vice chairman of the Slovak National Party, a
partner in the ruling coalition of which the defense minister is a
member, said her party was ``against these methods and the way of
governing'' shown by Meciar.
	   The opposition was up in arms.
	   ``This decision brought chaos into the Army and seriously
damaged the functioning and the reputation of the Slovak Army,''
said Jan Carnogursky, the chairman of the opposition Christian
Democrats.
	   Until Sitek returns from his vacation, there are two people
claiming each to be the Army's chief of staff.
	   Miklus was to be installed in his new position later Thursday.

Thai central bank accuses company executives of improper lending
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The central bank on Thursday accused
executives of a now-defunct finance company with extending 338
million baht (dlrs 8.1 million) of illegal loans. Unconfirmed
reports said one of the accused was a former Cabinet minister.
	   In announcing the filing of a criminal complaint against six
executives of General Finance and Securities, the central bank said
it was barred by law from naming the executives or other
individuals involved in the case.
	   But at least two Thai TV stations _ ITV and Channel 7 _ reported
Thursday night that one of the six executives was the defunct
company's former chairman and chief executive office, Narongchai
Akrasanee.
	   Narongchai, a noted economist, was commerce minister in the
previous government under former Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh.
	   General Finance was one of 56 finance companies shut down by the
government last December when they fell into virtual bankruptcy.
Assets of these companies are being liquidated by the government's
Financial Sector Restructuring Authority.
	   Rathakorn Nimwatana, the central bank's assistant governor for
legal affairs, said at a news conference that police had already
been asked to freeze the assets of the six executives and bar them
from travelling outside the country.
	   He said 32 counts of wrongdoing were contained in the complaints
against the six executives.
	   If found guilty, they could be sentenced to a maximum of 10
years in prison and a maximum fine of 1 million baht (dlrs 24,000).
	   Rathakorn said the executives extended the questionable loans
between Jan. 8, 1995 and Jan. 28, 1997 to a Thai company which
imported audio equipment.
	   The executives approved the loans with a single person as the
guarantor, and the guarantor did not put up any collateral, he
said.
	   Rathakorn said the person who served as guarantor himself
borrowed 148 million baht (dlrs 3.6 million) from General Finance,
which was once one of the country's largest finance companies.
	   He said the unnamed person also guaranteed other loan packages
amounting to another several hundreds of millions of baht which the
central bank is still investigating.
	   In dispensing the loans, the executives ignored a central bank
regulation announced in September 1994, said Rathakorn.
	   Rathakorn said the regulation requires finance companies to
review the value of the collateral of any loan package of more than
10 million baht (dlrs 240,000) at least once a year.
	   The granting of loans to insiders with little or no collateral
seems to have been a common practice with Thai banks and finance
companies before the financial system all but collapsed last year.
	   The government has been struggling since then to restore the
health of the financial sector, its most recent major move coming
last Friday when it announced a comprehensive restructuring plan
for ailing banks.

Ukrainian premier sets up tax posts at debtor enterprises
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Special tax posts will be set up in the
offices of tax-dodging Ukrainian companies to force them into
compliance, Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko said Thursday.
	   The tax posts, made of tax department and police officials, will
check production and sales of debtor companies, he said during a
trip to western Ukraine.
	   Earlier Thursday, acting Ukrainian tax chief Fedir Yaroshenko
said there were as many as 105,000 debtor companies in the country,
who altogether owe more than 8 billion hryvna (about dlrs 4
billion) to the federal and regional governments, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   The order establishing the tax posts was just the latest step in
Pustovoitenko's desperate crusade to collect taxes.
	   In recent weeks, he has resorted to such unorthodox measures as
keeping top executives from debtor companies in a tent camp for
purported civil defense training and seizing thousands of cars from
debtor companies as a method of pressure.
	   Pustovoitenko also has threatened to bring debtor executives to
court, and authorities have launched 70 criminal and 150 bankruptcy
cases, according to Interfax.
	   The government says the tax situation is critical, with the
state owned about 7 billion hryvna (about dlrs 3.5 billion) in
taxes, or close to a third of annual budget revenues, and some 3
billion hryvna (drls 1.5 billion) in payments to the Pension Fund.
	   Pustovoitenko's crackdown has yielded only a small fraction of
the debt so far.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's devaluation of the ruble and suspension
of debt payments was a last-ditch effort to avoid a full default,
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said Thursday.
	   ``If we were to continue servicing our debt and making payments
on treasury bills we would be unable to pay wages and pensions,''
Kiriyenko said in remarks broadcast by Russian television.
	   Kiriyenko scheduled a meeting with foreign investors later on
Thursday. He said they were working on a compromise debt payment
schedule.
	   ``We're not going to refuse to return this money to them, but
act together to calmly and thoroughly analyze the real
opportunities we have,'' the prime minister told the Cabinet.
	   Russia's financial crisis deepened this month as stocks fell
sharply and investors fled Russian bonds en masse even though
interest rates soared to 200 percent.
	   The Central Bank acknowledged Thursday that Russia's hard
currency reserves fell sharply in the days before the devaluation
was announced, falling nearly dlrs 2 billion last week _ from dlrs
17 billion as of Aug. 7 to dlrs 15.1 billion last Friday.
	   It also described the extent of Russia's capital flight, saying
that between dlrs 3.5 billion and dlrs 4.5 billion were taken out
of the country between May and mid-August, the Interfax news agency
said.
	   The government has continually failed to pay wages and pensions
to millions of Russians, sparking protests in several regions.
	   Kiriyenko said a suspension of payments on treasury bills would
add between 200 and 250 billion rubles (dlrs 29 and 36 billion) to
state coffers over the next 18 months that would help pay back
wages.
	   Unpaid wages grew by 6.5 percent in July and stood at 75.8
billion rubles (around dlrs 11 billion) as of the beginning of this
month, but only 20 percent of that is owed by the state.
	   The government had initially planned to announce the terms of
debt restructuring on Wednesday but postponed it until Monday under
pressure from foreign investors who feared that Russia was going to
offer them a worse deal than Russian banks. Those terms were
believed to be the top agenda item for Kiriyenko's session with the
investors.
	   The Central Bank said Thursday that Russian commercial banks
owed non-residents dlrs 19.2 billion as of July 1.
	   Meanwhile, the ruble's value remained virtually unchanged
Thursday at the Moscow currency exchange controlled by the Central
Bank which sets the official exchange rate, falling to 6.995 from
6.99.
	   The government has decided to allow the ruble to sink as low as
9.5 to the dollar, but is hoping that it will shortly stabilize at
around 7. Most bankers share this forecast and street rates for
selling dollars, which plunged to 9.5 and below earlier this week,
has stabilized around 7.5 to 8 at booths around Moscow on Thursday.
	   A longer-term forecast would strongly depend on the government's
stabilization efforts and the position of Russian commercial banks,
many of which are now in trouble because of over-dependence on
ruble assets.
	   Moving to avert panic, Central Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin
announced a plan to offer Russians a 100 percent guarantee on all
bank deposits. The plan would tie all accounts in commercial banks
to the national bank, Sberbank, whose deposits are already
guaranteed.
	   In a bid to vent popular anger over the painful moves, the
government established a hot line for Russians to report unfair
price hikes and make their proposals on how to overcome the crisis.
The tax police have promised to crack down on businesses that
unfairly crank up consumer prices.
	   The government on Thursday also discussed next year's draft
budget which is now being recalculated.
	   Kiriyenko said the government would proceed from the most
pessimistic scenario, assuming that world prices for oil and
natural gas _ Russia's main exports _ would remain low.
	   Meanwhile, the Budget and Finance Committee of the Russian
parliament's lower house, the State Duma, began discussing a
package of austerity measures proposed by the government earlier
this summer. The full Duma, whose earlier resistance has been cited
as a factor in the economy's collapse, will hold an emergency
session on Friday.

Yeltsin commemorates 30th anniversary of ``Prague Spring''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Patriarch quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday recalled the
``Prague Spring'' as an attempt ``to escape from ideological
dogmatism and lies,'' while Russia's Orthodox church leader called
for reconciliation among people of the former Soviet bloc.
	   ``Peace, to which all people are obliged in the name of Christ,
should be based not on political or personal ambitions, but on love
and cooperation,'' Patriarch Alexei II said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   More than 100 people were killed after Soviet tanks barreled
into Prague on Aug. 21, 1968, to halt nine months of reforms _
including free speech _ never before seen in the Soviet bloc.
	   Alexei said the Soviet invasion brought ``much sorrow'' to the
Czech people.
	   ``Similar feelings are caused by memories of bloodshed in Berlin
in 1953, in Budapest in 1956 and in Afghanistan in the 1980s,'' he
said.
	   In a telegram to the Congress of Russia Intellectuals, Yeltsin
said: `` Even shy attempts of reform called down terror from those
who wanted to preserve the totalitarian system.''
	   ``We do not threaten anyone or enforce our will,'' he wrote.
	   He also obliquely marked the anniversary of the Aug. 18-21,
1991, attempted coup against Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, in
which he played a key role in resisting coup forces.
	   ``We must remember the work of those days,'' the telegram read.
``And Russians, protecting democracy in August of 1991, proved:
There is no power that can stop the drive of the people towards
democracy.''

Human rights group: security forces illegally detain tax evaders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian police use illegal measures such as
prolonged arrests and beatings to collect money from tax evaders, a
Palestinian human rights group said Thursday.
	   Bassem Eid, head of the Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring
Group, said Palestinian security forces demand cash payment from
the offenders before they are released and issue no receipt for the
transaction.
	   ``It is not the job of the security forces to collect the money
in cash without receipts and hold the offender until he is able to
pay the amount,'' Eid told a news conference.
	   Eid's group collected 36 testimony from Palestinian businessmen
in the West Bank who said they have been arrested, beaten and asked
to pay large cash amounts before they were released.
	   Ibrahim Shawahin, a contractor from Hebron, said in his
affidavit he was detained for a year until he paid 35,000 shekels
(dlrs 10,000) in cash and wrote checks worth 210,000 shekels (drls
60,000).
	   Eid acknowledged that the security forces transfer the money to
the Finance Ministry and that those who complained to him had
caused the Palestinian Authority to lose millions of dollars in tax
revenue.
	   However, Eid said security forces have no business collecting
taxes.
	   Jibrin Bakri, head of Preventive Security Service in Hebron,
said his agents only got involved in criminal cases, such as those
involving forged invoices.
	   ``We have seized printers and stamps to make forged invoices. We
are dealing with criminals, not late tax payers. The tax authority
is aware of our actions,'' said Bakri who denied detainees were
being mistreated.

Japan's trade surplus rises for 16th straight month
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Obuchi comments in grafs 5-6 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Rising exports and falling imports pushed Japan's
trade surplus with the world 56.8 percent higher in July for the
16th straight month of increase, the government said Thursday.
	   The merchandise trade surplus, a tally of goods exported minus
imports, rose to 1.316 trillion yen (dlrs 9.14 billion) from the
same month last year, the Finance Ministry said.
	   The increase in the surplus _ which is measured as goods pass
customs but before adjustment for seasonal factors _ was slightly
lower than economists had forecast.
	   Japan's politically sensitive surplus with the United States,
meanwhile, continued to climb, rising 59.7 percent to 669.72
billion yen (dlrs 4.7 billion). It was the 22nd straight month of
increase.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said Thursday that he worried the
widening surplus ``could cause friction with many countries.''
	   ``We must create a system to increase our imports as quickly as
possible,'' Obuchi told reporters in Parliament. ``For that
purpose, it is important that we quickly revitalize our economy.''
	   With the world, Japanese exports in July rose 6.6 percent, while
imports fell 5.7 percent. Imports from the United States managed a
slim 0.9 percent increase, but were far outpaced by exports from
Japan, which rose 21.5 percent.
	   Exports to the European Union soared 174.5 percent, but
shipments to the crisis hit economies of Asia declined 36.2
percent.
	   Within Asia, exports to the countries of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, which have been most effected by the Asian
downturn, fell 63 percent in July.
	   The trade surplus has been rising as Japan has increased its
reliance on exports to pull itself out of a prolonged slump. The
weak domestic economy has also crimped demand for foreign goods.
	   Japan has also come under increasing pressure to revive its
recession-plagued economy and help struggling Asian nations by
importing more from the region.
	   Repeating recent assertions, the ministry said that while the
trade surplus was expected to continue growing for now, the
long-term outlook was for the pace of growth to slow down.

 &UR; Cruel Himalayas kill hundreds in India, perhaps aided by negligent
humans &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos DEL2-4 &QL; 
 &UR; By ASHOK SHARMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Whether because of the whims of nature
or human neglect, the Himalayas have been especially cruel this
year. Weakened by two weeks of rain, the mountains have cast down
entire villages, swept away a pilgrimage camp and probably killed
hundreds of people.
	   A half dozen lethal landslides were recorded this week in
northern India, leaving huge brown scars of mud and rubble on green
mountainsides. Environmentalists say too many trees have been
felled to anchor the earth. Geologists say the land slips would
have happened anyway, because the mountains are still forming and
are unstable.
	   The landslides struck an area of stark beauty and sparse
population. But even the few villages scattered on the side of the
lower Himalayas may have been enough to aggravate the natural
instability of the land.
	   The worst disaster occurred Tuesday near a rest camp along a
pilgrimage trail leading toward a Buddhist shrine in Tibet.
Landslides and heavy rains diverted the course of a stream and
turned it into a raging torrent that washed away pilgrims' huts and
toppled a guest house from a hill. Officials say 202 people are
dead or missing.
	   Iqbal Malik, an environmentalist who made the trek several years
ago, says the greenery along the route has been disappearing for
the last decade. ``There is no root system to hold on to the soil
and the rocks,'' she said.
	   Farmers and villagers use the trees for firewood and clear
patches for growing crops, although the degradation is much worse
in the lower hills where more people live.
	   While no figures were available for the specific area, the state
government of Uttar Pradesh says its forest cover has shrunk in
recent years to 14 percent, more than 4 percent below the accepted
standard.
	   Hundreds of Hindu pilgrims make the 120-mile (200 kilometer)
walk every year to the sacred shrine near Mt. Kailash across the
Chinese border. The summer is the only period when the snow melts
on the mountain passes, but that also is the time of the monsoon
rains that loosen the earth.
	   Malik says the government has not been careful enough in
protecting the busy route. ``The tourism activity and blasting of
mountains to build roads have been weakening the rock system,'' she
said.
	   Professor Om Prakash Goel, a geologist, agreed that the rocks in
the area were loosened and weathered. But bad planning also was
responsible for the calamity, and a pilgrim camp should never have
been built in such a vulnerable spot near a river bed.
	   A. Joshi, of the Geological Survey of India, said such
landslides were common in the Himalayas, a mountain range that is
relatively young and still growing. ``An accumulated stress is
released as part of that,'' Joshi said.
	   Authorities must show extra care in choosing tourist sites
``since we know these areas are prone to such disasters,'' he said.
	   Environmentalist Malik agreed. ``There is no planning. The
government only reacts to disasters. It never prevents them.''

Italian minister backs coops; anti-prostitution strategy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's minister for social affairs, who has
suggested prostitutes should band together in cooperatives, on
Thursday called on mayors to come up with a concerted strategy to
combat prostitution.
	   Minister Livia Turco has also come out in favor of the strong
fines against prostitutes' customers being levied by Milan and
several other cities to try to discourage the dealings between men
in cars and prostitutes in scanty clothing lingering near curbs.
	   Among cities and towns that have begun fining anyone negotiating
with a prostitute up to one million lire (dlrs 570) is Rimini, one
of Italy's major summer beach resorts.
	   ``If the mayors of these cities have instituted these measures
it is because the problem exists,'' Turco told RAI state radio.
	   Complaints by residents that the heart of their cities had
become dangerous and noisy prompted protests, which led to the
fines.
	   Turco said Italy needed to combat the practice of forced
prostitution and the drug trafficking sometimes associated with it.
	   Many of the prostitutes, with a large percentage of them from
Africa and eastern Europe, inadvertently become involved in
prostitution when they answer ads for work in Italy. When they
arrive in this country, their ``bosses'' often take their passports
and refuse to return them until the women earn a lot of money by
prostitution, which is not a crime in Italy.
	   Exploiting prostitutes is a crime.
	   Turco added she was not against prostitution in itself but was
against the reopening of brothels, which were shut down by law in
1958.
	   The minister has suggested that cities should help prostitutes
develop ways to manage their business on their own, such as in
cooperatives, and in areas where they won't be disturbing
residents.
	   Italian cities have been experimenting various techniques to
curb prostitution, especially in city centers. While past measure,
such as taking photos of cars of customers and mailing them home,
have had little success, the latest initiative appears to be
working.
	   According to Italian news reports, prostitution has declined by
80 percent in Rimini since police started levying fines last year.

Taiwanese businessman murdered in China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Taiwanese executive on a business trip to
southern China was smothered, stripped and thrown down a well in a
contract killing, the official Xinhua News Agency reported
Thursday.
	   Police in Shenzhen _ a city of booming business and rampant
crime bordering Hong Kong _ arrested mortgage company security
guard Wang Lei on August 12 for the murder of Wang Fujing, Xinhua
said.
	   A resident of Taiwan's Kaohsiung city, Wang Fujing was on the
board of directors of a Shenzhen packaging firm headed by his
brother. He traveled to Shenzhen last month and was last seen
leaving a dinner July 12, Xinhua said.
	   His naked body was found in the well on a city hill 15 days
later and an autopsy determined that he had been suffocated.
	   Suspect Wang Lei told police his boss, Jinfang Mortgage Company
chairman Chen Rongbiao, paid him and another accomplice 20,000 yuan
(dlrs 2,400) to help Taiwanese resident Wu Wunshun commit the
murder, Xinhua said.
	   The news agency gave no motive for the crime and said Chen and
Wu had fled to Taiwan.
	   The murder was the second death of a Taiwanese resident in China
in July and would likely strain already contentious relations
between the island and the mainland.
	   A Taiwanese politician, Kaohsiung city councillor Lin Ti-chuan,
died July 29, after being kidnapped and given an overdose of drugs.
	   China has been trying to coax Taiwan into opening talks on
unification. The two split after Mao Tse-tung's communists forced
Chiang Kai-shek's nationalists off the mainland in 1949. Beijing's
leaders still view the island as a renegade province.
	   Worried about being overwhelmed by its larger neighbor, Taiwan
has been reluctant to discuss reunification, saying China should
first become more prosperous and democratic.
	   The details of Wang Fujing's murder cited by Xinhua came in a
letter from the Association of Relation Across the Taiwan Straits,
China's office that handles ties with Taiwan.
	   The agency asked its counterpart, the Straits Exchange
Foundation, for help in tracking down murder suspects Chen Rongbiao
and Wu Wunshun.

OTTAWA: government's consent.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   The ruling marked a major victory for the federal government,
which had asked the court to rule. But the decision almost
certainly will embolden Quebec's separatist government, which
contends that residents of the mostly French-speaking province have
the right to decide for themselves whether to break away from
Canada.
	   The federal government, alarmed by the separatists' near-victory
in a 1995 referendum, turned to the Supreme Court in hopes of
convincing wavering Quebec voters that secession would not be quick
and painless.
	   The justice minister asked the court to rule on three questions.
Can Quebec legally declare unilateral independence under Canadian
law? Can it secede under international law? If there is a conflict,
which law prevails?
	   The court said that under Canadian law, Quebec was obligated to
negotiate with the federal government and the other provinces if it
sought to secede. It said international law, in regard to the
establishment of new states, did not apply to Quebec's situation.

Playwright seeks police help to resume play on Gandhi assassin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ The author of a play glorifying the
assassin of Indian independence leader Mohandas Gandhi has sought
police protection to resume the play disrupted last month by
violent protests.
	   The state government of Maharashtra said it would ban the play
because it was causing a problem of law and order by people
protesting that the play was offensive and denigrated an Indian
hero.
	   Pradeep Dalvi, author of ``I am Nathuram Godse Speaking,''
petitioned a Bombay court Wednesday saying he had never been served
orders banning the play, and demanded police protect the theater so
the play can reopen. A hearing was scheduled for next week.
	   ``If there is no official ban on the play, police should be
directed to give us protection when we perform,'' he told
reporters.
	   Maharashtra is governed by a coalition of the Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata Party and the right-wing Shiv Sena party, seen as
the closest political movement to Godse, the Hindu extremist who
killed Gandhi.
	   The producers of the play argue it gives a fair hearing to
Godse, who was hanged for shooting Gandhi at a 1948 prayer meeting.
Godse was opposed to Gandhi's ``appeasement'' of Muslims after the
colonial British rulers partitioned India into predominantly Hindu
India and officially Islamic Pakistan.
	   The play was staged 80 times in the past year in the Gujarati
language, but was stopped after five performances in the more
popular Marathi language.

OTTAWA: Quebec's situation.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   Quebec's separatist premier, Lucien Bouchard, is in a strong
position politically despite the court ruling. He now can run an
election campaign in the next few months claiming that Quebeckers'
right to decide their own destiny is under siege.
	   ``There is solid public opinion in Quebec that it's not up to
the Supreme Court to decide or limit in any way the right of the
Quebec people to choose their future,'' he said last week.
	   Bouchard was the separatists' charismatic campaign chief for the
1995 referendum, when they received 49.4 percent of the votes. He
became premier in early 1996 and had been an overwhelming favorite
for re-election until one of Canada's most popular politicians,
Jean Charest, left Parliament earlier this year to become leader of
Quebec's anti-separatist Liberal Party.
	   The latest polls show Charest's initial edge over Bouchard to be
shrinking, and the next provincial election _ either late this year
or next spring _ is expected to be quite close.
	   If Bouchard wins, he has pledged to call another referendum on
secession, though he has been vague about the timing.
	   Charest predicted Bouchard would try to provoke a pro-separatist
backlash after the Supreme Court ruling.
	   ``I'm convinced Bouchard's Parti Quebecois will denounce this
judgment as humiliating and degrading for Quebeckers,'' Charest
said. ``The meaning of the words will be exaggerated and
distorted.''

Yamasaki hit two home runs as the Central League's second-place
Chunichi Dragons trounced the Yakult Swallows 8-2 at Tokyo's Jingu

belted a home run in the seventh both for the Giants.
	   Shimizu has 10 homers and Matsui has 27 homers and leads the
league.
	   At Hiroshima, Darrel May hurled a seven-hitter over 6 1/3
innings and Dave Hansen singled home a run in the three-run second
inning as the Hanshin Tigers edged the Hiroshima Toyo Carp 4-3.
	   May, formerly with the Anaheim Angels, is 3-6. Hansen formerly
played with the Chicago Cubs.
	   In the Pacific League, Yuji Yoshioka slugged a three-run home

Muralidharan (5-34) sends England spinning to 256-8
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan sent
England spinning by taking five wickets as the home side managed
256 for eight after batting first in the limited-overs series final
at Lord's Thursday.
	   England openers Nick Knight, who scored 94 runs in 44 overs, and
Mike Atherton (64) gave the innings a promising start with a
132-run record opening stand before Muralidharan took control in a
10-over stint, grabbing 5-34.
	   Muralidharan triggered another all-too-familiar England
collapse, after the home side had been well placed on 191 for two
in the 39th over.
	   Skipper Arjuna Ranatunga made 16 bowling changes among his seven
bowlers _ five of them spinners _ to unsettle the England innings
after the 132-run first-wicket stand.
	   Atherton, playing his first one-day international in 16 months
since captaining the side against Australia in 1997, hit 64 runs
off 73 balls with seven fours to dominated the opening stand.
	   The partnership eclipsed the previous highest _ 123 between
Graham Gooch and Tim Robinson in Pune, India in 1987-88 _ before
the spinners tightened the grip on the innings.
	   While left-hander Knight provided the backbone of the innings,
facing 136 balls, the inform Alec Stewart (18) and Graeme Hick
(14), did little to bolster the total, falling to Muralidharan in
his send and third spells.
	   Muralidharan's fourth spell was too much for England as he took
3-0 in five balls and the home side had collapsed once again.
	   He caught and bowled Knight, trapped Nasser Hussain (0)
leg-before-wicket two balls later and, in his last over, bowled the
big hitting Alistair Brown (18) to finish with his fifth
five-wicket haul in his 99th match.
	   In fact, his was the best bowling record in 23 one-day
internationals at Lord's, improving on West Indian Joel Garner's
5-38 against England in the 1979 World Cup final.
	   Medium paceman Suresh Perera took two wickets in as many balls
in the 50th over of the innings but missed a hat-trick, sending
down a wide that beat the keeper to run for four. He finished with
2-44.
	   Knight's innings followed his 74 against South Africa in the
last qualifying match.
	   This was the third successive time the England middle order has
collapsed this series, following 7-24 in 35 balls against Sri Lanka
here and 8-69 against South Africa at Edgbaston.

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The German branch of the American
electronics concern Intel Corporation on Thursday denied there are
plans to build a computer processor plant in the Czech Republic.
	   Earlier in the day, Czech public radio, as well as other media
before, reported that Intel Corporation would build the plant worth
dlrs 1 billion in the Czech Republic.
	   The radio said the plant is to be built near the town of
Pardubice, 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Prague, and is to
employ up to 3,000 people.
	   But Marlon Thomspon of the German branch of Intel Corporation in
Munich, which is in charge of central Europe, said, ``These reports
are just rumors.
	   ``We visit several countries and check the investment climate
there, but there is no decision yet,'' she added.

Thirteen die, 39 injured, in Algeria bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A powerful bomb exploded Thursday in a
town southwest of Algiers, killing 13 people and injuring 39
others, authorities said.
	   The homemade device exploded in a square in El Khemis, near Ain
Defla, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) southwest of the capital.
Nobody claimed responsibility for the attack.
	   Authorities said seven of the injured people were in serious
condition.
	   The attack came a day after President Liamine Zeroual appealed
to his countrymen to be vigilant and face up to ``cowardly acts of
terrorism.''
	   In a rare televised broadcast, Zeroual said the ``security
situation is constantly improving'' and that ``Algeria is
recovering progressively its tranquility and hope.''
	   Algeria has been rocked by violence during a six-year insurgency
by Islamic insurgents.
	   The unrest was triggered by the government's decision to cancel
elections that the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front was poised to
win. An estimated 75,000 people have died in the violence.
	   Zeroual also said he wanted Algeria to ``recover its place on
the international scene'' and that a recent visit by a U.N.
delegation of observers showed Algeria was committed to allow the
world access to the North African country.

Report: Taiwan tycoon in talks to expand China project
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's Formosa Plastics Group is
considering nearly doubling the size of a Chinese power plant
project that has run afoul of Taiwanese investment restrictions,
United Evening News reported Thursday.
	   The group's chairman, Wang Yung-ching, has proposed increasing
from six to 10 the number of generators for the plant, now under
construction near Zhangzhou in China's Fujian province, the paper
said.
	   It quoted Fujian Deputy Gov. Chen Mingyi as saying he discussed
the project with Wang during a meeting earlier this week at the
tycoon's home in the United States.
	   The group plans to spend 3.2 billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs
91 million) on the plant, but has been forced to use its foreign
subsidiaries to finance the project because Taiwan's strictly
limits investment in China by its companies.
	   Concerns that excessive China investment will make Taiwan
vulnerable to pressure from Beijing has led the government to
impose a ceiling of U.S. dlrs 50 million on any single project.
Certain infrastructure projects _ including power plants _ have
been banned outright.
	   Wang said earlier this year the group will transfer ownership in
the power plant to foreign partners for as long as the government
restrictions remain in place.
	   The first of the plant's generators will go on line next year,
Taiwan's China Times Express reported.
	   Officials at Formosa Plastics were unable to confirm the report
Thursday.

Greenpeace activists board Norwegian oil rig
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS time element to Thursday &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Eight activists from the environmental
organization Greenpeace boarded the Norwegian drilling rig Deepsea
Bergen on Thursday to protest against further exploration for new
oil and gas fields.
	   The protesters arrived in inflatable boats when the rig was
preparing to move to another location to continue its search for
oil. They climbed onto the rig and managed to fasten a survival pod
on the side of the rig.
	   The Deepsea Bergen which is operated by the Norwegian state oil
company Statoil, had just plugged a well on the continental shelf
120 nautical miles off the Norwegian town of Kristiansund, 400
kilometers (250 miles) northwest of Oslo, and was about to be moved
to a location further south.
	   ``Since we have already found more than four times as much
fossil fuels as we can burn without risking problems with the
climate, we think it is a waste of time and money to look for even
more,'' said Kalle Hesstvedt of Greenpeace to The Associated Press.
	   The activists, who are from Britain, Denmark, Sweden, Finland
and Norway, have enough equipment, food, water and solar cells to
continue their protest for some time, Hesstvedt said.

Bhutto says Swiss judge should have waited
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A Swiss recommendation that former
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto be indicted on money-laundering
charges is a challenge to Pakistan's justice system, Ms. Bhutto's
spokesman said Thursday.
	   An investigating magistrate in Geneva on Wednesday asked the
Swiss government to recommend that Pakistan indict Ms. Bhutto. He
said had enough evidence to charge her in Switzerland, but that it
was not possible to bring her to Geneva to face charges.
	   Bhutto's spokesman, Karim Khan Agna, said the Swiss investigator
should not have acted until questions were resolved about the
legality of certain evidence.
	   Ms. Bhutto has asked a Pakistani provincial court to invalidate
documents she said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government sent to
Swiss officials. In her case filed July 28, Ms. Bhutto claimed the
documents were false and formed the basis of Swiss allegations
against her and her husband, Agna said.
	   Ms. Bhutto was ousted as prime minister in November 1996 on
charges of corruption and misrule. She says the numerous corruption
charges she faces were concocted by her rivals, including the
current prime minister.
	   The magistrate, Daniel Devaud, said he was asking for the
indictment in Ms. Bhutto's dealings with two Swiss firms, Societe
Generale de Surveillance and its former subsidiary Cotecna
Inspection SA.
	   Pakistani officials have said they gave Devaud numerous
documents that showed Ms. Bhutto and her husband Asif Zardari had
used Swiss connections to receive kickbacks on Pakistan government
contracts with the firms.
	   Last month, Devaud indicted Ms. Bhutto's husband on similar
charges. Swiss authorities say they have frozen about 20 million
Swiss francs (dlrs 13.8 million) in accounts belonging to Ms.
Bhutto and her family in seven Geneva banks.
	   In June, Devaud indicted three Swiss citizens _ a former senior
executive of SGS, the managing director of Cotecna and a lawyer who
served as Bhutto's and Zardari's agent in Switzerland.
	   Cotecna has denied any of its employees violated international
or national laws in the case. SGS has launched an internal
investigation.

EU asks WTO to investigate Canada car import taxes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission on Thursday
asked the World Trade Organization to investigate Canadian
government import tax subsidies to Canada's auto industry.
	   It said these subsidies ``distort international trade by giving
benefiting companies an unfair advantage over their European
competitors.''
	   Canada waives duty-free charges to car imports if these contain
Canadian-made components, the Commission said.
	   Vehicles imported to Canada from the EU have a 6.7 percent
tariff and automotive components face a 6 percent tax.
	   EU car exports to Canada were about dlrs 1 billion in 1997.
	   ``According to official Canadian sources, in 1997 just about 16
percent of the total imports of vehicles from the EU were granted
duty-free treatment under the scheme,'' the Commission said.

Iraq and Syria agree to reopen oil pipeline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq and Syria signed an agreement Thursday
to reopen a pipeline for Iraqi crude oil that was closed 16 years
ago, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
	   The agreement was signed by Iraqi Oil Minister Amer Mohammed
Rashid and his Syrian counterpart, Mohammed Maher Jamal.
	   The two sides agreed to reopen the pipeline linking Iraq's
Kirkuk oil fields to the Mediterranean terminals of Banias in Syria
and Tripoli in Lebanon.
	   They also agreed to continue contacts to boost further
cooperation, INA said.
	   Iraq, which is under sweeping U.N. trade sanctions, has to get
U.N. Security Council approval before the pipeline can be opened.
	   Syria closed the pipeline in 1982 in support of Iran during its
eight-year war with Iraq. Jamal's visit is the first by a Syrian
oil minister since relations were cut at the beginning of the
1980-88 war.
	   Jamal told INA that that his visit to Iraq was ``fruitful and
successful.'' He said the two sides built the foundations for
future cooperation in the oil field.
	   The Syrian-Iraqi pipeline has an estimated capacity of 650,000
barrels a day. Rashid has said the pipeline would first pump
300,000 a day on an experimental basis. The two sides also are
discussing opening a second oil pipeline, with a capacity of 1.4
million barrels daily, and an oil refinery.
	   The 820-kilometer (556-mile) pipeline was opened in 1949. Syria
currently is using the Banias line to transport its own crude; the
Tripoli leg is believed to be in poor condition.
	   Oil experts have estimated that some dlrs 80-90 million are
required to repair the pipeline, which both countries have to seek
from foreign lenders. A new pipeline would require foreign
investors.
	   Under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program, Iraq may export
oil only via Turkey and its Gulf terminal at Mina al-Bakr. It would
require U.N. permission to use the Syrian channel. The United
Nations imposed trade sanctions after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   In February, the U.N. Security Council decided to allow Iraq to
increase the value of oil sales under the oil-for-food deal from
dlrs 2 billion every six months to dlrs 5.2 billion. The
oil-for-food deal is an exception from the U.N. sanctions.

Russia, Tajikistan call for UN Security Council to meet over

Afghanistan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia and Tajikistan called Thursday on the U.N.
Security Council to meet with representatives from the Central
Asian countries bordering Afghanistan, a news agency said.
	   Russia and the former Soviet republics in Central Asia are
worried that if the Taliban Islamic army gains full control of
Afghanistan, it will mean of exodus of refugees and weapons into
their countries.
	   Tajik and Russian officials meeting in the Tajik capital of
Dushanbe said they should meet with the Security Council to discuss
Afghanistan, and asked that no country send troops to halt the
Taliban, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The officials also said they are ``ready to maintain contact
with representatives of the conflicting sides in Afghanistan at any
level in order to find a way to end combat actions as soon as
possible,'' ITAR-Tass said.
	   Meanwhile, Russia is pondering whether to add 5,000 troops to
its 25,000-man force in Tajikistan, Interfax said, citing
unidentified officials in Russia's Defense Ministry.
	   Defense ministers from Russia, Belarus, and some of the Central
Asian countries will meet at the end of August to watch air defense
exercises in Russia's north and discuss the Taliban threat, the
Interfax news agency said.
	   Russia's defense minister, along with those from Kazakstan,
Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, also plan to meet Sept. 4 to
discuss strengthening borders with Afghanistan.

Report: Japan's Hashimoto to visit Russia, France next month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Former Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto is expected
to visit Russia and France for six days in September on his first
assignment as the government's top foreign policy adviser, a news
report said Thursday.
	   Hashimoto will go to Russia Sept. 18 and to France Sept. 20,
Kyodo News agency reported, citing unidentified government
officials. He was invited by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
French President Jacques Chirac, Kyodo said. He is scheduled to
return to Japan on Sept. 23.
	   The Foreign Ministry could not be reached late Thursday to
confirm the report.
	   Hashimoto resigned as prime minister last month and was named
special foreign policy advisor by his successor, Keizo Obuchi.
Obuchi served as foreign minister under Hashimoto.
	   A few days before Hashimoto's departure, Foreign Minister
Masahiko Komura will visit Russia for three days starting from
Sept. 13 for talks with Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov.
	   The visits are aimed at paving the way for Obuchi's visit there
in November, the first official trip to Moscow by a Japanese prime
minister since 1973.
	   The two countries are working to put together a peace treaty by
2000. A territorial dispute over the Kuril island chain _
controlled by Russia but claimed by Japan _ has prevented the two
from signing a treaty ending World War II. Tokyo and Moscow
restored bilateral ties in 1956.
	   While Hashimoto was prime minister, he held two rounds of
informal summit talks with Yeltsin _ in Russia last November and in
Japan in April.

Greenpeace activists board Norwegian oil rig
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Eight activists from the environmental
organization Greenpeace boarded the Norwegian drilling rig Deepsea
Bergen on Thursday to protest against further exploration for new
oil and gas fields.
	   The protesters arrived in inflatable boats when the rig was
preparing to move to another location to continue its search for
oil. They climbed onto the rig and managed to fasten a survival pod
on the side of the rig.
	   The Deepsea Bergen, is operated by the Norwegian state oil
company Statoil, had just plugged a well on the continental shelf
120 nautical miles off the Norwegian town of Kristiansund, 400
kilometers (250 miles) northwest of Oslo, and was about to be moved
to a location further south.
	   ``Since we have already found more than four times as much
fossil fuels as we can burn without risking problems with the
climate, we think it is a waste of time and money to look for even
more,'' said Kalle Hesstvedt of Greenpeace to The Associated Press.
	   The activists, who are from Britain, Denmark, Sweden, Finland
and Norway, have enough equipment, food, water and solar cells to
continue their protest for some time, Hesstvedt said.

Canada's Supreme Court says Quebec cannot secede unilaterally
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES previous, UPDATES throughout with high court giving
Quebec nationalists some hope for negotiations, other details. ADDS
byline.
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ In a historic ruling sure to ignite controversy,
Canada's Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Quebec cannot secede
without the federal government's consent.
	   The ruling marked a major victory for the federal government,
which had asked the court to rule on the issue. But the decision
almost certainly will antagonize Quebec's provincial government,
which favors independence, and could encourage it to hold a new
independence referendum.
	   Quebec's ruling Parti Quebecois contends that residents of the
mostly French-speaking province have the right to decide for
themselves whether to break away from Canada.
	   The high court ruling did give Quebec nationalists some grounds
for satisfaction. It said federal authorities would have a duty to
conduct negotiations about secession if a clear majority of
Quebeckers supported independence in a fair referendum.
	   The federal government turned to the Supreme Court after being
shaken by French separatists' near-victory in a 1995 referendum.
The government hoped a favorable court ruling would convince
wavering Quebec voters that secession would not be quick and
painless.
	   The justice minister asked the court to rule on three questions.
Can Quebec legally declare unilateral independence under Canadian
law? Can it secede under international law? If there is a conflict,
which law prevails?
	   The court said under Canadian law, Quebec was obligated to
negotiate with the federal government and the other provinces if it
sought to secede. It said international law, in regard to the
establishment of new states, did not apply to Quebec's situation.
	   Quebec's separatist premier, Lucien Bouchard, is in a strong
position politically despite the court ruling. He now can run an
election campaign in the next few months claiming that Quebeckers'
right to decide their own destiny is under siege.
	   ``There is solid public opinion in Quebec that it's not up to
the Supreme Court to decide or limit in any way the right of the
Quebec people to choose their future,'' he said last week.
	   Bouchard was the separatists' charismatic campaign chief for the
1995 referendum, when they received 49.4 percent of the votes. He
became Quebec premier in early 1996 and had been an overwhelming
favorite for re-election until one of Canada's most popular
politicians, Jean Charest, left Parliament earlier this year to
become leader of Quebec's anti-separatist Liberal Party.
	   The latest polls show Charest's initial edge over Bouchard to be
shrinking, and the next provincial election _ either late this year
or next spring _ is expected to be quite close.
	   If Bouchard wins, he has pledged to call another referendum on
secession, though he has been vague about the timing.
	   Charest predicted that Bouchard would try to provoke a
pro-separatist backlash after the Supreme Court ruling.
	   ``I'm convinced Bouchard's Parti Quebecois will denounce this
judgment as humiliating and degrading for Quebeckers,'' Charest
said. ``The meaning of the words will be exaggerated and
distorted.''

Biggest Dutch bank reports 20 percent profit growth in 1998's first

half &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Leading Dutch bank ABN Amro
Holding NV said Thursday net profit rose 20 percent to 2.45 billion
guilders (dlrs 1.21 billion) in the first half of 1998, as strong
performances worldwide made up for minor negative effects of the
economic turmoil in Asia.
	   ABN Amro said it expects net profit in the second half to
increase compared with the same period in 1997, assuming the
economic situation in Asia and Russia does not significantly
deteriorate.
	   The bank's revenue rose from 11.36 billion guilders (dlrs 5.61
billion) in the first six months of 1997 to 13.60 billion guilders
(dlrs 6.72 billion) in the same period this year.
	   ABN Amro increased provisions for loan losses again in 1998's
first half to 892 million guilders (dlrs 440.9 million) from 492
million guilders (dlrs 243.2 million) in the comparative period of
1997 largely due to higher reserves for loan losses in a number of
specific countries, including Indonesia, Thailand, Pakistan and
Turkey.
	   Results from financial transactions rose 69 percent to 666
million guilders (dlrs 329.2 million) in the first half of 1998.
	   The bank noted that currency volatility in a number of foreign
exchange markets led to a significant rise in currency trading
results.
	   In North America, pretax profits rose 39 percent to 1.1 billion
guilders (dlrs 543.7 million) compared with the same period in
1997.
	   In the Asia Pacific region, pretax profits fell 1.7 percent to
169 million guilders (dlrs 83.5 million), mainly on bad-debt
provisions for country risks. But the bank noted that the
provisions were ``relatively limited,'' due to the significant
proportion of multinationals in its Asian portfolio.
	   ABN's stock on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange rose 1.50 guilders
(dlrs 0.74), or 3 percent, to 51.60 guilders (dlrs 25.50), in early
trading while the 27-share AEX index was up just 0.5 percent.

Respected Dutch columnist under fire for `anti-gay' column
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A controversial newspaper column
harshly criticizing the ``hedonism'' of a week of homosexual events
tied to the Gay Games has sparked a torrent of protest in the
tolerant Netherlands.
	   The columnist responsible hit back Thursday against charges of
anti-homosexual discrimination.
	   In an article in last Friday's edition of the respected national
daily De Volkskrant under the headline ``An Amsterdam Orgy,''
columnist Gerry van der List described one man's self-confessed
homosexual promiscuity as ``disgusting.''
	   ``It's strange that few people ... dare to defend good taste
against the hedonism and coarseness in the homosexual theme park
that was Amsterdam during the Gay Games,'' Van der List wrote.
	   He also pondered a possible link between decadent and
promiscuous lifestyles and a recent child pornography scandal that
has rocked the Netherlands.
	   A Dutch anti-discrimination watchdog urged Amsterdam's Public
Prosecutor to investigate whether Van der List can be prosecuted
for the column. Attorneys specializing in media law have said such
a prosecution is unlikely in a land where freedom of speech is
guaranteed.
	   The Gay Games, an alternative Olympics for homosexual athletes,
drew 15,000 competitors to the Dutch capital earlier this month for
a week of sporting contests, cultural events and partying.
	   De Volkskrant was flooded with complaints following the
article's publication. As of Thursday, 75 readers had canceled
their subscriptions.
	   The owners of Amsterdam's Van Vlaanderen restaurant canceled a
reservation made by Volkskrant journalists, saying they had
homosexual staff who didn't want to run into Van der List.
	   But in an article headed ``I am not for discrimination against
homosexuals,'' Van der List wrote Thursday that he had expressed
``in a slightly teasing way that I am not very fond of camp
behavior or transvestites.''
	   An apparently unrepentant Van der List continued that
``exhibitionism and hedonism'' surrounding the Gay Games ``are a
symbol of a decadent culture intent on shallow pleasure. As a good
citizen I have a problem with the promiscuity often displayed and
even preached within the gay scene.''
	   Henk Krol, editor of De Gay Krant, an Amsterdam-based weekly
devoted to the homosexual scene, was quoted by De Volkskrant as
saying he respected the freedom of columnists to state their
opinions.
	   Krol, however, added that ``in a few passages Van der List has
gone too far. Particularly linking homosexuality to child
pornography. Scandalous.''

state-run news agency HINA reported.
	   The 43-year-old German citizen, identified only by the initials
J.M., regretted his mistake and even burst into tears in a court in
Sibenik, a Croatian coastal town 250 kilometers (156 miles) south
of Zagreb, it said.
	   The judge, Jadranka Biga Milutin, accepted his explanation that
the flare was fired accidentally from his speed boat.
	   The highest penalty for lighting a fire in the countryside is
three years in prison.
	   The blaze was extinguished soon on the island of Zlarin. The
German said he tried to stop the fire but failed to do so.
	   It took Croatian firefighters 1 1/2 hours to stop it. About 20
hectare (50 acres) of pine forest were destroyed.
	   Dozens of homes have been leveled to the ground and two people
killed in more than 200 forest and brush fires sweeping through
southern Croatia in August. Most of the fires were sparked by
natural causes.

	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ A rebel offer to talk peace with President
Laurent Kabila came, western diplomats said Thursday, after the
opposition force secured control of a key western town that is the
last major obstacle before the capital of Kinshasa.
	   Political leaders in the rebel movement made the surprise offer
Wednesday to negotiate a cease-fire with the government, although
fighting was reported coming from the area around Mbanza-Ngungu,
about 150 kilometers (95 miles) south of the capital, a western
diplomat in Kinshasa said on condition of anonymity.
	   ``The negotiation offer has not stopped the fighting,'' the
diplomat said.
	   Two other ministry-level officials also confirmed that the
rebels were in Mbanza-Ngungu and that fighting near that city was
continuing.
	   In a sudden shift in tone, the political wing of the rebel
movement _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsi fighters, Rwandan soldiers
and disaffected members of the Kabila's military _ said talks were
possible if the government acknowledged the crisis was the result
of domestic problems.
	   ``We believe the solution to this problem is a political
solution,'' said Bizima Karaha, Kabila's former foreign minister
who fled to join the rebellion.
	   In Goma, Karaha and another political member of the rebellion,
Ernest Wamba dia Wamba _ an ally just after independence in 1960 of
Congo's first Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba _ met for a second day
with three South Africans, apparently to determine what kind of
talks were possible with Kabila, and when they could happen.
	   The three South Africans refused to give their names and said
they were not in a position to comment on their mission.
	   Karaha would only say the team had a mandate from the Congolese
government to negotiate with the rebels.
	   The government, however, says the rebels are simply pawns in a
Rwandan military move to dominate the region.
	   Kabila has throughout insisted neighboring Rwanda orchestrated
the revolt with the support of Uganda _ a charge both countries
deny.
	   ``We will not negotiate with the instruments of Rwanda and
Uganda,'' Information Minister Didier Mumengi said in Kinshasa,
adding he believed Kabila would only agree to talk directly with
Rwanda and Uganda.
	   The government in recent days has been emboldened by a pledge
from several of its southern neighbors to back Kabila. Zimbabwe
says it will provide troops for Congo's war effort.
	   Zambia, Namibia and Angola also have offered support to Kabila,
but in no specific terms.
	   In Ethiopia, the Organization of African Unity also said it
backed Kabila and urged the rebels to lay down their weapons.
	   The rebels played their negotiation card after two weeks of
rapid military advances in which they captured most key towns in
eastern Congo and the west.
	   They control a key corridor from the Atlantic coastline to
Mbanza-Ngungu, almost 300 kilometers (185 miles) inland.
	   In Goma, Wambia dia Wamba warned against outside intervention in
support of Kabila.
	   ``Political leadership in Zimbabwe seems to be siding with the
enemy we're fighting,'' he told a rally of several thousand people.
``No military assistance will bring a definite solution.''
	   He made no mention of a cease-fire but repeated that the only
solution was a political one.
	   Rebel chief commander Jean-Pierre Ondekane, who in the past has
ruled out negotiations, was absent from the rally Thursday and was
not present Wednesday when Karaha spoke of the possibility of a
cease-fire.
	   His whereabouts were not known, and only low-ranking rebel
military officers were present at the rally.
	   Ondekane has been quoted recently as saying it was he and the
military _ not the civilians in the rebellion _ who were directing
the shots in the movement.
	   In Kinshasa, state-controlled Voice of the People radio made no
mention of the rebel offer.
	   Power came back on late Thursday morning in Kinshasa, which had
been without electricity since earlier this week after rebels
control the town of Inga, the location of the main power dam that
supplies Kinshasa. It was unclear, though, why the power was
switched back on.

IOC medical chief stands by comments on Spain, refuses to resign
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Olympics-IOC-Drugs &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The IOC's anti-doping chief on
Thursday refused to retract his allegation that sports doctors in
Spain encourage drug use and rejected calls for his resignation.
	   Prince Alexandre de Merode, chairman of the International
Olympic Committee's medical commission, said his comments about
``tendencies toward doping'' in Spain applied to all countries.
	   ``There is a tendency toward doping also in the United States,
Britain and the whole world,'' he said. ``It applies to everybody.
Do you know a country where there isn't a tendency toward doping?
It doesn't exist. It's a reality in all the world.''
	   De Merode caused a storm of protest in Spain with his statements
in an interview published Monday in the French newspaper Le Figaro.
	   The Belgian official expressed astonishment at recent remarks by
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, who called for a drastic
reduction in the list of banned substances and suggested only drugs
which are harmful to athletes should be prohibited.
	   De Merode told Le Figaro that Samaranch, who is Spanish, was
espousing the view of Spanish doctors ``who have rejected the
ethics of their profession.''
	   ``One must not forget that Spanish sports, for a long time, has
had tendencies toward doping,'' de Merode told the paper. ``A
president of the athletics federation was even excluded because he
refused to select athletes who didn't resort to doping.''
	   Spanish government officials accused de Merode of smearing
Spanish sport with false allegations, and the Spanish national
Olympic committee on Wednesday called on him to resign from his IOC
post unless he retracted the comments.
	   Spanish Olympic committee chief Carlos Ferrer Salat said de
Merode's comments were ``astounding'' and unbecoming of a man in
his position.
	   But de Merode remained defiant Thursday. He said he singled out
Spain only because Samaranch is Spanish and because the IOC
president had given his interview in Barcelona.
	   ``The Spanish outcry doesn't interest me,'' de Merode said.
	   He shrugged off the calls for his resignation.
	   ``So they can ask,'' he said. ``It doesn't move me at all. I
will be speaking to Spanish officilas. There is no reason to get
upset. The idea wasn't to single out Spain.''
	   De Merode also insisted there was no conflict between himself
and Samaranch. While Samaranch has spoken in favor of slashing the
list of banned drugs, de Merode said the list should _ and will _
stay the same.
	   ``There is no difficulty between us, no discord,'' de Merode
said. ``This is not a battle between him and me. The list will not
be reduced. We review the list each year, but there is no big
change.''

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Football Association of Japan will enter
contract negotiations with Philippe Troussier of France to become
head coach of Japan's national soccer team, a news report said
Thursday.
	   Troussier, who coached South Africa's team during this summer's
World Cup in France, will arrive in Tokyo next week for the
negotiations, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   If hired, the 43-year-old would likely be signed to a two-year
contract that would include the 2000 Sydney Olympics, the report
said. He would replace Takeshi Okada, who quit after his team lost
all three of its matches in the World Cup.
	   The other top candidate, Arsene Wenger, a Frenchman who coaches
the English Premier League team Arsenal, backed out because of
restrictions in his contract with the British team, it said.
	   Wenger is a former manager of the Nagoya Grampus Eight, a team
in the Japanese professional soccer league, Kyodo said.

Gorbachev to testify against Yeltsin in Duma's impeachment
</HEADLINE>
commission &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev said on
Thursday he would appear before a Russian parliament commission
that is searching for legal grounds to impeach his long-time foe,
Boris Yeltsin.
	   ``I'm ready to answer their questions,'' Gorbachev said on Echo
Moscow radio. ``I don't want to ignore their invitation and show
disrespect.''
	   The Communist-led opposition in the lower house of parliament,
the State Duma, has accused Yeltsin of instigating the collapse of
the Soviet Union as the head of the Russian republic.
	   The impeachment campaign started earlier this summer, before the
latest wave of financial crisis engulfed Russia.
	   The Duma commission has also invited former presidents Leonid
Kravchuk of Ukraine and Stanislav Shushkevich of Belarus, who
together with Yeltsin signed the December 1991 agreement declaring
the Soviet Union defunct and creating the Commonwealth of
Independent States, a loose coalition of former Soviet republics.
Neither has responded.
	   In the radio interview on Thursday, Gorbachev said that Yeltsin,
eager to oust him from the Kremlin, thwarted all efforts to keep
the Soviet republics together. ``Russia's stance played a key
role'' in the Soviet collapse, Gorbachev said.
	   Yeltsin, Kravchuk and Shushkevich effectively sidestepped
Gorbachev by signing the agreement, which also effectively left
Gorbachev without a job. Other republics had no other choice than
to follow the same path and join the CIS.
	   Communist lawmakers call Yeltsin's action high treason, saying
that Russia lost much of its wealth and military might in the
Soviet collapse.
	   Supporters of the impeachment motion also accuse Yeltsin of
ruining Russia's economy and military, and say he acted improperly
when he launched the botched war in Chechnya and used troops and
tanks against his foes in the former Russian parliament in October
1993.
	   The Duma's panel is to prepare formal charges before the house
votes on whether to launch the motion. At least two-thirds of the
Duma's 450 members must support the move.
	   A number of previous attempts to oust Yeltsin have failed, and
the current move is expected to meet the same fate, although the
current economic turmoil might strengthen it.
	   Russia's constitution gives the president a strong hand in
confrontations with parliament. The constitution is vague on the
grounds for which a president can be impeached, citing only treason
and grave misconduct.
	   An impeachment motion would also require approval from both the
Constitutional and Supreme Courts, as well as the upper chamber of
parliament _ a body made up of regional leaders, most of whom are
loyal to Yeltsin.

Bomb suspect reveals attack was planned in July

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ An Egyptian Islamic militant planned
the bomb attacks on U.S. Embassies in East Africa that killed 257
people, according to a senior government official who saw the
confession of a suspect arrested in Pakistan.
	   The suspect, identified by U.S. and Kenyan officials as Mohammed
Saddiq Odeh, said planning began in July under the direction of a
man he called Ali Saleh, a member of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad
group.
	   The government source, who insisted on anonymity, said Thursday
that Saleh was an Egyptian and a close associate of Osama Bin
Laden, a Saudi millionaire living in Afghanistan who has called on
Muslims to attack American installations. Saleh led Bin Laden's
terrorist group in Africa, the source said.
	   Several groups use the name Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War.
Before the bombings, a group known as the Islamic Jihad considered
the successor to the groups that assassinated Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat in 1981, reportedly vowed to strike American interests
because some of its members were arrested in Albania.
	   Odeh was arrested in Pakistan after arriving on a flight from
Nairobi on Aug. 7, the day of the bombings. Immigration officials
who noticed he did not match his Yemeni passport photograph stopped
him at Pakistan's Karachi airport, and he was questioned.
	   The source said Pakistani investigators questioned Odeh for
several days before he revealed his role in the bombing. By then,
the source said, any accomplices would probably have already
managed to slip into Afghanistan, where Odeh said he had been
headed.
	   Officials at a Pakistani land-crossing to Afghanistan stopped a
Sudanese and a Saudi on Saturday, suspicious because the pair had
no travel documents. They were questioned as suspects in the
African bombings, but the government source said it was unlikely a
connection would be found and said they would probably soon be
released or deported. Muslims from around the world routinely pass
through Pakistan to fight with the extremist Taliban militia in the
Afghan civil war.
	   Odeh told Pakistani interrogators six other conspirators left
Kenya before the explosion, arriving in Pakistan on different
flights between Aug. 5 and Aug. 7.
	   The main conspirators left before the explosions in Nairobi,
Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, leaving behind Kenyans and
Tanzanians hired to carry out the bombings.
	   Odeh told investigators he designed the explosives used only in
the attack on the U.S. embassy in Dar Es Salaam.
	   Odeh's confession clearly links Bin Laden to the bomb attacks,
the source said.
	   The alleged involvement of Bin Laden has provoked intense
speculation in Pakistan that Washington is planning to seize the
world's most wanted terrorist from Afghanistan. The swift
evacuation of American embassy personnel from Pakistan earlier this
weak further fueled speculation.
	   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Simons dismissed the reports. Pakistani
officials have said repeatedly they have not been asked to let
their territory be used as a staging ground for a U.S. operation in
Afghanistan.
	   The son of Palestinian parents, Odeh was born in Tabuk in Saudi
Arabia in March, 1965. He joined the Palestinian Liberation
Organization while studying in Jordan. He acquired a diploma in
architecture from the Philippines.
	   Odeh went to Afghanistan in 1990 to fight alongside Afghan
Muslims against a communist government. While in Afghanistan he met
bin Laden, a legendary figure among the Arabs who had come to join
the Afghan struggle.
	   After the fall of Afghanistan's communist government in 1992,
Odeh said bin Laden sent him to Kenya in 1994 to attack U.S.
interests in Africa.
	   Odeh told Pakistani investigators that he was involved in
killing of two Belgian members of the U.N. peacekeeping force in
Somalia. The source had no other details on the killings.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Officials in the breakaway republic of Chechnya
have tried, but failed, to free President Boris Yeltsin's envoy to
the region who was kidnapped nearly four months ago, a news agency
said Thursday.
	   Chechnya's anti-abduction squad raided the town of Suruta in the
southern Shatoi region on Wednesday where they believed Valentin
Vlasov was held, but did not find him, spokesman Shadid Bargishev
said, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Vlasov was kidnapped at gunpoint May 1. No one has claimed
responsibility for the kidnapping.
	   Hundreds of people have been kidnapped in Chechnya and
surrounding regions, usually for ransom, since the region's
two-year war for independence from Russia ended in 1996.
	   Bargishev said 17 people are still being held hostage in and
around Chechnya, including four foreigners. Others say there are
more.
	   In their raid Wednesday, Chechen officials freed a Russian man
who was being held for dlrs 500,000 ransom. Oleg Yemelyantsev said
he learned from his guards on the eve of his release that Vlasov
was being held in the same town as him.

U.N. nuclear treaty commission condemns India and Pakistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MELISSA EDDY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Arms control officials called Thursday on
India and Pakistan to sign the international treaty banning nuclear
test explosions. The accord could unravel if those countries and
others do not ratify the accord next year.
	   Following a three-day meeting in Vienna, the commission which
oversees the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty urged the two
countries ``to sign and ratify'' the 1996 accord, which would
outlaw all nuclear test explosions.
	   The commission chairman, John Freeman, said the representatives
of countries which have signed the treaty ``expressed deep concern
and regret'' that both India and Pakistan had conducted nuclear
tests in May.
	   Freeman said the commission had invited both India and Pakistan
to participate in a nuclear safety training course in Kazakhstan in
September. Pakistan agreed to send an observer, but India declined,
saying no one was available to attend.
	   The refusal of the two subcontinent neighbors to sign the treaty
could undercut international efforts to ban test explosions.
	   Under the terms of the accord, all 44 countries which maintain
active nuclear research programs must sign and ratify the treaty by
September 1999 in order for it to become binding under
international law.
	   The 44 states include India and Pakistan. Neither will sign
before the other.
	   India tried to blocked the treaty altogether in 1996 during the
final stages of negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland. But the
Australians sidestepped the normal procedures and took the issue to
the full U.N. General Assembly, which approved in September 1996.
	   President Clinton became the first world leader to sign the
treaty, although Congress is unlikely to ratify it soon.
	   But enforcement, verification and on-site inspection provisions
of the treaty cannot go into effect until India, Pakistan and the
42 others sign and ratify the agreement.
	   If the September 1999 deadline passes without the necessary
signatures, the countries that have ratified will meet to decide
what to do.
	   So far, 150 countries have signed the treaty and 17 have
ratified it. They include only two of the seven countries which
acknowledge having nuclear weapons _ France and Britain.
	   Apart from India and Pakistan, the others include the United
States, Russia and China.
	   Despite the uncertainty of the agreement's future, Freeman said
a worldwide monitoring network to track nuclear explosions was
nearly complete. The system will include 310 monitoring stations
worldwide and a databank at U.N. offices in Vienna.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The government of Laos will not accept
more than 10,000 ethnic Hmong living at a temple in Thailand,
disputing claims that the hilltribe people come from Laos, the
Laotian state news agency KPL reported Thursday.
	   At issue are an estimated 13,000 Hmong staying at the Tham
Krabok Buddhist temple in Saraburi, 90 kilometers (56 miles) north
of Bangkok. Many are believed to be illegal immigrants from Laos
who slipped out of official Thai refugee camps to avoid be
repatriated.
	   The Thai government has shown uncertainty in how to treat the
Hmong at the temple. Initially it indicated it would seek to send
the back to Laos, but recently official have said there are no such
plans.
	   Deciding their fate is difficult because it is almost impossible
to determine their identities or country of origin.
	   ``The Hmong residents at Wat Tham Krabok in Saraburi, Thailand
are not originally from the Lao People's Democratic Republic,''
reported KPL, which said it based its assertion on information from
Laotian government agencies.
	   KPL said Laotian authorities would not accept the repatriation
of the Hmong because Thai officials said the temple was not a
refugee camp, and therefore did not regard the its residents as
refugees,
	   It also noted that the abbot of the temple, Phra Chamroon
Panchan, claimed the temple's residents came from northern
Thailand.
	   Laotian authorities hold that ``the issue of the Hmong at Tham
Krabok is an internal affair of the Thai government and it should
be settled within Thailand without any connection'' with Laos, said
the report.
	   Thai Foreign Ministry Spokesman Kobsak Chutikul said the
government understands Laos' position regarding repatriation
because the origin of the Hmong at Tham Krabok has yet to be
established.
	   Kobsak said calls for repatriation was made by individual Thai
officials and insisted that the government has no plan to
repatriate the Hmong.
	   ``We have previously asked the United Nation High Commissioner
for Refugees to help determine their status, which would involve
resettlement in a third country or negotiation with the country of
origin to allow for repatriation,'' said Kobsak.
	   He said the UNHCR has yet to respond.
	   Many Hmong fled Laos after the communist takeover of the country
in 1975. Many had fought with anti-communist forces recruited by
the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency to try to prop up a
pro-American regime during more than a decade of civil war.

Five years later, Peres hails historic Israeli-Palestinian accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Despite the dismal state of
Israeli-Palestinian peace-making, former Prime Minister Shimon
Peres believes the process he began will survive and that
Palestinian statehood will eventually become a reality.
	   Ahead of a trip to Oslo, Norway, to mark the fifth anniversary
of the historic accord, the Nobel laureate told The Associated
Press on Thursday that the deal was ``one of the greatest
achievements of my life.''
	   Peres was foreign minister in 1993 and led the Israeli team of
negotiators in secret talks with the PLO, which led to an agreement
of mutual recognition and to a framework agreement on Palestinian
autonomy. The agreement was signed Sept. 13, 1993 in Washington.
	   Over the next two and a half years, two more accords were signed
and Israel withdrew its forces from two-thirds of the Gaza Strip
and one-third of the West Bank.
	   But the process was painful and violent for both sides. A Jewish
settler shot and killed 29 Muslim worshipers and Palestinian
militants carried out deadly attacks that killed over 100 Israelis.
	   Four suicide bombings in the spring of 1996 helped bring about
the election of Benjamin Netanyahu of the hardline Likud Party who
faulted the Oslo accord for creating bloodshed instead of peace.
	   Netanyahu won on a promise to slow down the process and keep
more occupied land under Israeli control. Within months of his
election, the negotiations came to a stand-still in March 1997.
	   With the sides hardly speaking less than a year before the
negotiations are to be completed, critics say the Oslo agreements
have failed.
	   But Peres looked on the positive side.
	   ``Before Oslo, we had a Palestinian problem, but no partner.
Here ... a Palestinian partner was established,'' Peres said in
interview in his Tel Aviv office crammed with memorabilia from half
a century of public service, including a framed photograph of him,
the late Yitzhak Rabin, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S.
President Bill Clinton signing a peace agreement in Washington.
	   Peres said he believed the current setbacks in the process are
temporary. ``If the government doesn't move ahead, it will fall,
not the peace process,'' he said.
	   Peres said Israelis were indebted to Norway for hosting the
talks. Hours before his flight to Oslo on Thursday, Peres was
clearly excited about the milestone.
	   Peres, Arafat and U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross will all attend
Sunday's event. But Netanyahu has said he was too busy to attend.
	   Peres called Netanyahu's snub ``a terrible mistake'' and said
the ceremony offered an opportunity to advance peace.
	   The peace agreements brought Nobel Peace prizes for Peres,
Arafat and Rabin, killed by a Jewish extremist in November 1995 for
handing over land some believe was promised to the Jews by God.
	   But Peres said Israel has both a moral obligation and an
interest in assisting in the creation of a Palestinian state on
that land. ``The alternative ... is an on-going clash between two
peoples,'' he said.

Respected Dutch columnist under fire for `anti-gay' column
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A controversial newspaper column
harshly criticizing the ``hedonism'' of a week of homosexual events
tied to the Gay Games has sparked a torrent of protest in the
tolerant Netherlands.
	   The columnist responsible hit back Thursday against charges he
was discrimination against homosexuals.
	   In an article in last Friday's edition of the respected national
daily De Volkskrant under the headline ``An Amsterdam Orgy,''
columnist Gerry van der List described one man's self-confessed
homosexual promiscuity as ``disgusting.''
	   ``It's strange that few people ... dare to defend good taste
against the hedonism and coarseness in the homosexual theme park
that was Amsterdam during the Gay Games,'' Van der List wrote.
	   He also pondered a possible link between decadent and
promiscuous lifestyles and a recent child pornography scandal that
has rocked the Netherlands.
	   A Dutch anti-discrimination watchdog urged Amsterdam's Public
Prosecutor to investigate whether Van der List can be prosecuted
for the column. Attorneys specializing in media law have said such
a prosecution is unlikely in a land where freedom of speech is
guaranteed.
	   The Gay Games, an alternative Olympics for homosexual athletes,
drew 15,000 competitors to the Dutch capital earlier this month for
a week of sporting contests, cultural events and partying.
	   De Volkskrant was flooded with complaints following the
article's publication. As of Thursday, 75 readers had canceled
their subscriptions.
	   The owners of Amsterdam's Van Vlaanderen restaurant canceled a
reservation made by Volkskrant journalists, saying they had
homosexual staff who didn't want to run into Van der List.
	   But in an article headed ``I am not for discrimination against
homosexuals,'' Van der List wrote Thursday that he had expressed
``in a slightly teasing way that I am not very fond of camp
behavior or transvestites.''
	   An apparently unrepentant Van der List continued that
``exhibitionism and hedonism'' surrounding the Gay Games ``are a
symbol of a decadent culture intent on shallow pleasure. As a good
citizen I have a problem with the promiscuity often displayed and
even preached within the gay scene.''
	   Henk Krol, editor of De Gay Krant, an Amsterdam-based weekly
devoted to the homosexual scene, was quoted by De Volkskrant as
saying he respected the freedom of columnists to state their
opinions.
	   Krol, however, added that ``in a few passages Van der List has
gone too far. Particularly linking homosexuality to child
pornography. Scandalous.''

Central Europe remains stable despite ruble crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEATA PASEK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A shift toward the West in recent years
means Central Europe's candidates to join the European Union cope
more easily with bad news from the East, such as this week's
Russian ruble devaluation.
	   Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic _ all former Soviet-bloc
countries seeking EU membership _ experienced an initial weakening
of their currencies and stock markets when the Russian crisis
erupted Monday.
	   Some of those losses have been regained and little further
impact is expected immediately, unless the Russian situation
continues to deteriorate.
	   Economic analysts attribute the comfort zone to radical reforms
by the three nations since freeing themselves from Soviet dominance
around the start of the decade.
	   ``Geographically we are close but economically we are very far
apart,'' noted Witold Orlowski of the Independent Institute of
Economic Research in Warsaw.
	   Economic shock therapy has included selling off bloated,
money-losing state companies and introducing free market
principles. Such moves increased unemployment and raised prices,
but also opened markets to more goods and most importantly,
insulated the economies from Russia.
	   ``We are so closely tied to the EU, especially Germany, that
even slight changes in growth there affect us 20 times more than a
huge crisis in Russia,'' Orlowski said.
	   All three of the former Soviet satellites now export less than
10 percent of their goods to Russia and instead have close trade
ties with the EU, the world's biggest trading bloc. Hungary sells
72 percent of its exports to the EU, compared to 66 percent for
Poland and 63 percent for the Czech Republic.
	   Initial news of the Russian crisis caused some foreign investors
to withdraw capital from Central European markets in an instinctive
reaction from the past.
	   ``Stereotypes persist that the former Soviet economies are still
dependent on each other,'' said Cezary Jozefiak of Poland's
Monetary Policy Council.
	   Former Soviet states have been hit much harder by the Russian
crisis.
	   In Ukraine, Deputy Economics Minister Leonid Mynin recommended
that Ukrainians do business in foreign currencies instead of rubles
``and to sign revised contracts with their Russian partners
urgently.'' Russia is Ukraine's main economic partner, accounting
for 32 percent of Ukrainian exports in 1997.
	   ``The fall of the ruble will have a much bigger impact in those
countries which are still closely linked to the Russian markets,
like the Ukraine,'' said Robert Beange of Leaman Brothers in the
Mlada Fronta Dnes, a Czech daily.
	   International investors also have tried to cover their
ruble-based losses by selling in emerging markets, such as Central
Europe, but that is considered a short-term hedge.
	   The situation has even helped Poland, said Orlowski, noting that
the zloty currency was considered too strong in recent weeks and
has now weakened against the dollar due to the loss of foreign
capital.

TVM cyclists face more questioning as drug probe widens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   REIMS, France (AP) _ Six cyclists from the TVM cycling team
faced a new round of questioning Thursday from French police
investigating the use of illegal doping substances during the Tour
de France.
	   More TVM cyclists could be called in for questioning next week,
according to a judicial source speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   Laurent Roux, Lars Michaelsen and Peter van Petegem were among
the riders questioned Thursday in Reims, a town about 150
kilometers (80 miles) east of Paris.
	   The recent Tour de France was dominated by revelations of drug
taking by cyclists.
	   Police have already begun interrogating the TVM team, whose
members withdrew from the Tour saying they had neither the physical
nor the mental strength to continue.
	   TVM team director Cees Priem and doctor Andrei Mikhailov have
been placed under formal investigation, a step short of being
formally charged.
	   The TVM investigation began in March when customs agents
searching a team car found EPO, a substance which increases oxygen
to red blood cells.

 &UR; Some 50 die every day in Sudanese town &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Some 50 people are dying of starvation
every day in a key southern Sudanese town, some in open areas and
abandoned homes because they cannot find shelter, a senior official
said.
	   Riak Machar, a former rebel commander now allied with the
government, said that in Wau ``a large number of people die in open
areas and in deserted houses because they cannot find shelter, and
this causes great damage to the public health situation.''
	   His remarks were reported Thursday in the independent daily
Akhbar al-Sa'a.
	   Wau is the capital of the southern state of Bahr al-Ghazal,
where some 750,000 people face starvation.
	   The town is under government control, but rebels rule much of
the countryside.
	   Some 77,000 people have flooded into Wau, a town of about
100,000, since the start of the latest famine.
	   International aid agencies have estimated that 1.5 million
people are facing starvation across southern Sudan.
	   Some 1.5 million people have died from fighting and famine since
the start of the country's 15-year civil war. Southern rebels are
seeking greater autonomy for the predominantly African, Christian
and animist south from the Muslim and Arab north.

<TEXT>
	   TULKAREM, West Bank (AP) _ A man stabbed his three young
children _ ages 1, 3 and 5 _ to death early Thursday in an apparent
dispute between his wife and ex-wife, Palestinian authorities said.
	   Abdel Lateef Bedo, 50, was under arrest in the northern West
Bank city of Tulkarem.
	   Tulkarem Governor Izzedine Sharif said Bedo came to the city
police station Thursday morning carrying a knife and told police,
``I killed my children.''
	   Bedo, who worked in Israel as a laborer, lived with his wife,
ex-wife, and the children of both women in a two-bedroom house in
the Tulkarem refugee camp, neighbors said. Since the former wife
moved in last year after losing her job and house, the two women
were constantly fighting, neighbor Hussein Johar said.
	   After a fight between the two women on Wednesday, the wife left
the house and did not return until Thursday morning.
	   Bedo's former wife and three of her daughters, who range from 16
to 26, were also detained for questioning.
	   Another neighbor, Ibrahim Hemidan, said Bedo's 5-year-old son
had been stabbed in the face and chest, and his daughters, ages 3
and 1, had been stabbed in the stomach.

Report: Following MTV, CNN to disappear from Amsterdam's screens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Cable News Network reportedly will
become the latest foreign channel to disappear from television
screens in the Dutch capital because of a fee dispute with a cable
company.
	   CNN has refused to pay 700,000 guilders (dlrs 350,000) per year
to air its round-the-clock news coverage on Amsterdam's A2000 cable
network, Dutch media reported Thursday. It will disappear from
screens Aug. 25.
	   A2000 could not immediately be reached to confirm the report. If
true, it would make Amsterdam the only major capital in Western
Europe without CNN.
	   Earlier this month the plug was pulled on music channel MTV
Europe after it refused to pay a similar fee. Eurosport and The
Discovery Channel also have pulled out of Amsterdam for the same
reasons.

U.N. nuclear treaty commission condemns India and Pakistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MELISSA EDDY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Arms control officials on Thursday urged
India and Pakistan to sign the international treaty banning nuclear
test explosions. The accord could unravel if those countries and
others do not ratify the accord next year.
	   After a three-day meeting in Vienna, the commission which
oversees the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty asked the two
countries ``to sign and ratify'' the 1996 accord, which would
outlaw all nuclear test explosions.
	   The commission chairman, John Freeman, said the representatives
of countries which have signed the treaty ``expressed deep concern
and regret'' that both India and Pakistan had conducted nuclear
tests in May.
	   Freeman said the commission had invited both India and Pakistan
to participate in a nuclear safety training course in Kazakhstan in
September. Pakistan agreed to send an observer, but India declined,
saying no one was available to attend.
	   The refusal of the two neighbors to sign the treaty could
undercut international efforts to ban test explosions.
	   Under the terms of the accord, all 44 countries which maintain
active nuclear research programs must sign and ratify the treaty by
September 1999 in order for it to become binding under
international law.
	   The 44 states include India and Pakistan. Neither will sign
before the other.
	   India tried to blocked the treaty altogether in 1996 during the
final stages of negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland. But the
Australians sidestepped the normal procedures and took the issue to
the full U.N. General Assembly, which approved in September 1996.
	   President Bill Clinton became the first world leader to sign the
treaty, although Congress is unlikely to ratify it soon.
	   But enforcement, verification and on-site inspection provisions
of the treaty cannot go into effect until India, Pakistan and the
42 others sign and ratify the agreement.
	   If the September 1999 deadline passes without the necessary
signatures, the countries that have ratified will meet to decide
what to do.
	   So far, 150 countries have signed the treaty and 17 have
ratified it. They include only two of the seven countries which
acknowledge having nuclear weapons _ France and Britain.
	   Apart from India and Pakistan, the others include the United
States, Russia and China.
	   Despite the uncertainty of the agreement's future, Freeman said
a worldwide monitoring network to track nuclear explosions was
nearly complete. The system will include 310 monitoring stations
worldwide and a databank at U.N. offices in Vienna.

Czechs struggle with legacy of failed communist reforms

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Thirty years after Soviet tanks
smothered the democratic reforms of the ``Prague Spring,'' Czechs
are looking back at the Soviet-led invasion with a mixture of
nostalgia, cynicism _ and silence.
	   On August 21, 1968, five armies of the Soviet-dominated Warsaw
Pact entered Czechoslovakia, kidnapped the country's leaders and
put an abrupt end to nine months of free speech and assembly
unprecedented in the Soviet bloc.
	   About a hundred people were killed in the invasion, and Soviet
military bases sprang up around the country. Hundreds of thousands
fled in fear of political revenge.
	   In a speech Thursday broadcast by Czech radio, ailing President
Vaclav Havel said Soviet-led invasion ``revealed what Communism
really means.''
	   ``It revealed its totalitarian character, '' Havel said. ``From
France to Russia, it had a fundamental impact'' on public
perceptions of the nature of the Communist system.
	   But while many Czechs still remember the painful events, the
more recent 1989 anti-communist revolution seems to have dwarfed
the historical significance of Czech Communist leader Alexander
Dubcek's failed attempt to reform the Marxist system.
	   The country planned no official commemoration of the invasion, a
remarkable decision in itself.
	   ``I remember my parents talking about it. I know it was
terrible, but I never quite understood what really happened,'' said
Miroslav Sehnal, a 33-year-old waiter. ``At any rate, the (1989
anti-communist) revolution was the real thing for me.''
	   Facing international outrage in 1968, Moscow tried to justify
the invasion as ``international assistance'' given to orthodox
Communists defending socialism from Czechoslovak leaders who the
Soviets claimed were bent on destroying, not reforming, the
communist system.
	   Still, most Czechs see the invasion as an act of aggression.
According to a poll by Sofres-Factum that was conducted among 1,085
Czechs in July, only 3 percent approved of it. The local polling
agency provided no margin of error.
	   Despite the consensus, many questions loom for the average
Czech: Did the experiment in communist reform change anything? Was
it worth the suffering?
	   And would it have really been possible to reshape the system had
Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev not crushed the effort so brutally?
	   No one seems to be offering answers.
	   Leading politicians such as Prime Minister Milos Zeman and his
rival, former Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, are largely ignoring the
anniversary, busy focusing on local politics.
	   Havel and writer Milan Kundera have clashed over the importance
of the Prague Spring shortly after the invasion.
	   Havel argued that Dubcek's efforts were pointless because the
Communist regime was unreformable. Kundera declared Prague Spring
``a moment of stardom'' for the Czechs.
	   History made Havel the president. Kundera became a best-selling
author exiled in Paris. The two different viewpoints remain.
	   Some say Czechs should have held on to their ideals longer after
the invasion.
	   ``There is a whole range of possibilities between resignation
and military resistance ... we gave up too fast,'' Petr Pithart, a
Communist-turned-dissident who now serves as speaker of the Czech
Senate, told the newspaper Lidove Noviny.
	   Others still say reforming communism was impossible.
	   There is no doubt the 1968 crackdown on reformers is politically
linked to the 1989 revolution, which also paved the way for the
breakup of Czechoslovakia into two countries, the Czech Republic
and Slovakia.
	   Charter 77, a dissident movement that helped bring about the
change, was established by Prague Spring veterans, including Havel.
It focused on human rights rather than politics, bringing together
former Communists, intellectuals as well as Catholic priests.
	   Paradoxically, the greatest praise for Dubcek and his allies
currently comes from Russia, which stifled the reforms.
	   Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader whose perestroika
precipitated the collapse of the Soviet Union, thinks the Prague
Spring was a major turning point.
	   ``It was the beginning of the end of the totalitarian system,''
he recently told Narodna Obroda, a Slovak daily.
	   ``It was also this influence that gave me the courage to start
fundamental change.''

Swiss balloon adventurer finds new teammate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHATEAU D'OEX, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss pilot Bertrand Piccard
will make his third attempt to circle the globe in a balloon this
winter with a Concorde flight engineer, it was announced Thursday.
	   Last February, Piccard's Breitling Orbiter 2 balloon broke the
record for longest time spent in the air by a balloon, landing in
Myanmar after a flight lasting 9 days, 17 hours and 55 minutes.
	   Piccard plans another attempt at the round-the-world challenge
with Anthony Brown, who works as a flight engineer on supersonic
Concorde aircraft for British Airways, his team said in a
statement.
	   The Swiss pilot needed a new team member because Belgian pilot
Wim Verstraeten and British flight engineer Andy Elson, who took
part in February's flight, had to drop out due to other
commitments.
	   Brown, from England, owns a major balloon-flight company and has
taken part in various balloon competitions, the statement added.
	   Piccard, Brown and the team's flight director Alan Noble are
currently in China in an effort to obtain clearance for the
Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon to fly over the country.
	   The last balloon's round-the-world bid was abandoned after China
refused it entry, causing it to miss out on jet-stream winds needed
to speed it over the Pacific.
	   The new balloon is in the final phase of construction in
Bristol, England, Thursday's statement said.
	   Earlier this week, American balloonist Steve Fossett's latest
attempt at the elusive global record ended when a storm damaged his
balloon, sending it plunging into the sea off Australia.
	   He had broken his own distance record, traveling more than
24,461 kilometers (15,200 miles). But Piccard's team retained the
flight duration record.

Aid agencies complete first phase of campaign to wipe out polio
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ The first phase of a nationwide
campaign to wipe out polio in Somalia ended in total success with
more than 180,000 children now immunized against the disease, a
health official said Thursday.
	   Osman Mahamud Dufle, a local health official in the capital
Mogadishu, said hundreds of volunteers had assisted in informing
people of the campaign and distributing the vaccine over a five-day
period this week.
	   The campaign, sponsored by UNICEF and the World Health
Organization in collaboration with local health authorities, is
aimed at immunizing more than 900,000 children under the age of 5.
	   The second five-day phase of the Somali campaign, part of a
worldwide effort to wipe out polio by 2000, will begin on Sept. 13.
	   Ali Ma'ow, a Somali who had the last documented case in 1977 of
the now eradicated disease, smallpox, has been participating in the
campaign, urging Somalis not to be the last victims of polio as
well.
	   More than 400 volunteers were involved in the campaign in
Mogadishu, while 2,600 others worked to reach people in the central
and southern regions of the country.
	   Dufle said the first phase was a total success, despite the
death of one volunteer who was shot in the town of Balad, 30
kilometers (20 miles) north of Mogadishu on Wednesday while he was
calling through a loudspeaker for parents to bring their children
for free polio vaccine.
	   Reports Thursday blamed the shooting on bandits who have been
active in the Somali capital since faction leaders agreed to work
together to set up a municpal administration for the first time in
seven years.
	   Somalia has been without a central government since clan-based
factions ousted President Mohammed Siad Barre in 1991 and then
began fighting each other.

Secretive research institute denies reports of deaths on site
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - A biological research institute allegedly
involved in weapons production on Thursday denied a British report
that four employees were killed and 25 injured in accidents at the
secretive facility in recent years.
	   The London-based Foreign Report magazine said this week that in
one of the accidents, authorities came close to ordering the
evacuation of homes near the Israel Institute for Biological
Research in Nes Ziona, a suburb of Tel Aviv.
	   In separate statements Thursday, the institute and the office of
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there have never been any
accidents at the site that resulted in death or injury.
	   The Foreign Report said the facility made biological and
chemical weapons. Last year, Israel's Haaretz daily reported that
the institute was developing antidotes to various types of nerve
gas, including the deadly VX reportedly in Syrian hands.
	   Thursday's statements did not deal with those claims.
	   A former director of the institute, Marcus Klingberg, was
sentenced to 18 years in prison in 1983 for reportedly passing
secrets about biological warfare to the Soviet Union. The trial was
held in secret and not made public until 1993.

Too much flesh: Leading Italians plead for a cover-up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Squirming on behalf of society, a group of Italian
celebrities, politicians and business leaders have signed their
names to a ``declaration of discomfort'' over the nudity
omnipresent in Italy's media.
	   Photos of all-but-naked women are everywhere before Italians'
eyes, spread across the front pages of mass-circulation dailies, TV
screens and the sides of buses. Summer is high season for flesh
shots, with newspapers seizing the opportunity to show all but the
few inches (millimeters) covered by a beachgoer's thong.
	   Accustomed to the overexposure, the average Italian doesn't even
blink ; Italian media regularly promise to change, but don't.
	   The group of prominent protesters _ including Rome's mayor, the
head of the Bank of Italy, members of Parliament, the nationally
well-known singer Mina and a national news anchor, Enrico Mentana _
opted for a dignified protest.
	   All signed their names to an anti-nudity-proliferation statement
in the upcoming weekly magazine Liberal, Italy's AGI news agency
reported Thursday.
	   ``We believe it's worthwhile to signal disapproval,'' the
opponents said, sounding less than hopeful of results.
	   The civic leaders intended their protest not as a manifesto or
an appeal, but as a kind of ``declaration of discomfort,'' AGI
said.

Council meets on sanctions, no movement expected
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council reviewed the status
of Iraqi sanctions on Thursday, but western diplomats said they
expected little or no movement to lift the measures because of the
standoff over arms inspections.
	   China's deputy ambassador, Shen Guofang, said his country wanted
to give Iraq some indication that the sanctions would eventually be
eased.
	   ``We should give some light to Iraq in the dark tunnel,'' he
said, going into the regular, 60-day review of the sanctions
regime.
	   But other diplomats have said the council wasn't prepared to
give any indication of sanctions relief _ particularly because of
Iraq's decision Aug. 5 to halt cooperation with arms inspectors.
	   The arms experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the Security Council will lift sanctions imposed in 1990
after Iraq invaded Kuwait, touching off the Gulf war.
	   The sanctions bar air travel to and from the country and regular
exports of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay.
	   Baghdad said it was ceasing cooperation with the United Nations
because the chief weapons inspector, Richard Butler, refused to
certify that Iraq had destroyed its banned weapons.
	   Butler on Wednesday sent a letter to Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz requesting Iraq resume cooperation, but Aziz rejected
the request on Thursday.
	   ``I think the biggest problem is the mistrust between the two
sides,'' said Shen, China's deputy representative.
	   In an editorial Thursday in The New York Times, Iraq's
ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said Iraq will never be able to satisfy
inspectors because they are asking Baghdad to prove a negative _
that Iraq doesn't have banned weapons.
	   ``The inspectors are searching for black cat in a dark room,
where the cat does not exist,'' Hamdoon wrote.
	   ``How many more Iraqis will have to die because Richard Butler's
team has not yet found another document, which cannot be located
because there is no such document in the first place?'' Hamdoon
asked.

Inter defender throws water balloon, hurting two children
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAPLES, Italy (AP) _ A day after a water balloon came hurtling
down from a Naples hotel room, crashing through a car windshield
and injuring two children, Inter Milan defender Fabio Galante said
he was behind the prank.
	   ``It was an accident,'' Galante said Thursday on Italian
television newscasts. ``We were throwing balloons at each other and
I was trying to hit my teammates on the balcony, but the balloon
ended up in the streets and hit a car.''
	   Two children, ages 11 and 12, who were in the passing car were
taken to the hospital for checkups. News reports said they had been
slightly injured.
	   Galante said he apologized to the children at the hospital and
promised to send them a jersey of his famous Brazilian teammate,
Ronaldo. But the family said it would sue Galante.
	   The incident occurred hours before Inter faced Naples in an
exhibition match whose profits were destined for hundreds of people
left homeless in Sarno, south of Naples, by the devastating
mudslides in May.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ An Egyptian Islamic militant planned
the bomb attacks on U.S. Embassies in East Africa that killed 257
people, a suspect arrested in Pakistan reportedly said.
	   A senior Pakistani government official told The Associated Press
that he saw the confession of the suspect, identified by U.S. and
Kenyan officials as Mohammed Saddiq Odeh. The suspect said the
attack was planned starting in July under the direction of a man he
called Ali Saleh, a member of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad group, the
official said.
	   The government source, who insisted on anonymity, said Thursday
that Saleh was an Egyptian and a close associate of Osama Bin
Laden, a Saudi millionaire living in Afghanistan who has called on
Muslims to attack American installations. Saleh led Bin Laden's
terrorist group in Africa, and began planning the attack in July,
the source said.

Belarus minister asks peasants to take to the fields
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The deputy prime minister of Belarus
appealed to farmers on state television Thursday to harvest their
private plots of grain before the crop spoils.
	   He told farmers not to wait for the help President Alexander
Lukashenko promised they would receive from collective farms in
gathering crops on their own land, and said they should even revert
to primitive farming practices to do it.
	   ``What do people expect? What is there to hope for?'' said
Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Garkun. ``Of course the order of the
president giving help will be fulfilled... but the population must
take up sickles and reapers themselves, and reap, and gather.''
	   Lukashenko had previously made similar pleas to the population,
but directed most of his attention to collective farms, offering
incentives to the best reapers.
	   Official media have reported that only one-quarter of the
country's grain has been harvested so far, a statistic which bodes
poorly for Belarus, where agriculture makes up some 40 percent of
the economy.
	   Bad weather and outdated equipment are mostly to blame.

	   The agreement was signed by Iraq's oil minister, Lt. Gen. Amer
Mohammed Rashid, and his Syrian counterpart, Mohammed Maher Jamal.
	   The pact outlines a schedule to rehabilitate the pipeline that
links Iraqi oil fields around the northern city of Kirkuk to the
Mediterranean terminal at Banias, Syria. A spur leads to the
Lebanese port at Tripoli.
	   Iraq, which is under sweeping U.N. trade sanctions, must get
U.N. Security Council approval before the pipeline can be reopened.
It remains unclear where funds for the project will come from.
	   Meanwhile, U.N. spokesman Eric Falt told a news conference in
Baghdad that just eight contracts valued at dlrs 23 million had so
far been approved by the United Nations in New York for repairing
Iraqi oil facilities.
	   Iraq wants to import some dlrs 300 million in spare parts for
its oil industry under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program. The
program, an exception from the sweeping trade sanctions imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, allows Baghdad to sell
limited quantities of oil to buy needed food, medicine and other
necessities.
	   Falt said that low world oil prices and the slow pace of
approvals for oil-industry spare parts meant that Iraq had less
money than expected to spend for food and medicine.
	   The latest phase of the oil-for-food program allows Iraq to sell
dlrs 5.2 billion worth of oil, up from the previous dlrs 2 billion
every six months.
	   Iraq has accused the United States and Britain of deliberately
holding up the contracts for spare parts.
	   Syria closed the pipeline in 1982 because it supported Iran in
its eight-year war with Iraq. Diplomatic ties between Iraq and
Syria were cut early in the war, but relations have warmed in
recent months.
	   Jamal told INA that that his visit to Iraq was ``fruitful and
successful.'' He said the two sides built the foundations for
future cooperation in the oil field.
	   The Iraqi pipeline to Syria has an estimated estimated capacity
of about one million barrels a day.
	   Rashid has said the agreement called for Iraq to pump about
300,000 barrels a day through the pipeline to Banias on an
experimental basis.
	   The two sides also are discussing construction of a second oil
pipeline, with a capacity of 1.4 million barrels daily, and an oil
refinery.
	   The 820-kilometer (556-mile) pipeline was opened in 1949. Syria
currently is using the Banias line to transport its own crude; the
Tripoli leg is believed to be in poor condition.
	   Oil experts have estimated that some dlrs 80 million to dlrs 90
million are required to repair the pipeline, which both countries
have to seek from foreign lenders. A new pipeline would require
foreign investors.
	   Under the oil-for-food program, Iraq may export oil only via
Turkey and its Gulf terminal at Mina al-Bakr, where the crude is
monitored by U.N. inspectors.

Netanyahu snubs ceremony marking fifth anniversary of peace accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quote from Netanyahu spokesman, Norwegian foreign
minister calling Netanyahu, CORRECTS that ceremony is Monday, sted
Sunday &QL; 
 &UR; By DANNA HARMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Saying he is too busy to indulge in
``nostalgia,'' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will skip next
week's ceremony in Oslo marking the fifth anniversary of Israel's
breakthrough peace accord with the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu's decision drew criticism Thursday from the dovish
opposition and even his own coalition leader who said the prime
minister should have used the ceremony to try and renew contacts
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   ``It's a terrible mistake,'' former Prime Minister Shimon Peres
said of Netanyahu's snub. ``We owe our thanks to the people of
Norway.''
	   Earlier this week, Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek
called Netanyahu at a hotel in northern Israel where the prime
minister is vacationing and asked him to reconsider.
	   In 1993, Norway hosted the secret contacts between Israel and
the PLO that led to an agreement of mutual recognition and to a
framework agreement on Palestinian autonomy. The agreement was
finalized on Aug. 19-20 and was signed Sept. 13, 1993 in
Washington.
	   Peres, Arafat and U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross will attend
Monday's ceremony in Norway.
	   As opposition leader, Netanyahu staunchly opposed the so-called
Oslo agreements, saying they posed a danger to Israel's existence.
When he became prime minister in 1996, Netanyahu said he would
honor Israel's commitments, but talks with the Palestinians over
Israeli withdrawals in the West Bank have stalled since March 1997.
	   Netanyahu's spokesman, Aviv Bushinsky, said the prime minister
was too busy to fly to Norway. ``The prime minister prefers to
remain in the country in an effort to advance the peace process...
and not deal in ceremonialism and nostalgia,'' Bushinsky said.
	   In an interview with Israel Channel 2 TV, Bushinsky added that
it must be remembered that Netanyahu, ``did not support the
agreement to begin with.''
	   Israel will be represented in Norway by Netanyahu's political
adviser, Uzi Arad, and Meir Shetreet, the coalition chairman.
	   Shetreet said he was puzzled by Netanyahu's decision.
	   ``I cannot get into the prime minister's calculations, but I
think he should have been there,'' said Shetreet. ``Netanyahu and
Arafat need to meet in order to finalize the deal on withdrawal and
I don't see how else it can be done.''

Kenyans eager to post their ideas about bomb blast on billboard

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A project originally intended to interest
passersby in painting and photography has become a giant billboard
on which Kenyans are expressing their feelings about the bombing of
the U.S. Embassy two weeks ago.
	   ``It is amazing how really hungry Kenyans are to write their
ideas about the bomb blast,'' Dutch painter Rene Klarenbeek said
Thursday on the first day of a month-long project in which he is
doing a fresh painting every day based on photographs chosen by
different groups of Kenyans.
	   Klarenbeek paints over a photographic image projected on a white
billboard. Thursday's photo was of two women who were injured in
the Aug. 7 blast that killed 247 people.
	   It was selected by youths from a Nairobi slum who are
participating in a photo project.
	   ``This is what the audience wanted painted,'' said Rob Burnet,
director of Kuona Trust, one of the project's sponsors. ``We invite
people to come and see the painting and comment.''
	   The billboard, 3 meters by 3 meters (9 ft by 9 ft), is mounted
on Aga Khan Walk, about 100 meters (yards) from the site of the
blast in downtown Nairobi.
	   Burnet said passersby received blank sheets of paper on which to
write their feelings about the bombing.
	   ``What we have discovered is that we have unlocked a huge store
of emotions,'' he said, adding that the comments would be tacked on
the billboard.
	   Klarenbeek, 34, said the daily billboard painting is part of a
personal project he is doing in various parts of the world entitled
``The Painter is Travelling.''
	   ``We can have it in a gallery, but it will limit our audience.
How many people go to a gallery?'' he said. ``I have to go to the
people, if they don't come to me,'' he said.
	   Magdalene Githaiga, a Nairobi housewife, said she was just
walking past the billboard when she was handed a piece of paper.
	   ``We have a lot to say about the bomb blast. I wish they can
extend the project to the people in offices to express their ideas
without fear,'' she said as she signed her message.
	   The project is funded by the Dutch Embassy in Nairobi and
organized by Kuona Trust, a project associated with the National
Museums of Kenya designed to get Kenyans interested in art.
	   Klarenbeek said the daily paintings and the comments are posted
on the project's website on the Internet.
	   The address is http://painter.bart.nl.

Irianese political prisoner released on parole

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A separatist rebel of the Free Papua
Movement, was released Thursday on parole after serving nearly nine
years of his 17-year jail term.
	   Yacob Rumbiak, a member of the movement, that has been fighting
for independence in Irian Jaya, Indonesia's part of western New
Guinea, was arrested in December 1989 following a pro-independence
protest in Jayapura, that involved about 35,000 demonstrators.
	   Rumbiak, 39, and 86 other Irianeses were then condemned for
subversion.
	   The movement, known as OPM, has been fighting for independence
since Indonesia took control of Irian Jaya from Dutch colonizers in
1963. The mineral-rich territory was formally incorporated with
Indonesia after a U.N.-supervised ballot six years later.
	   Rumbiak had earlier served his sentence in prisons in East Java
capital of Surabaya and West Java town of Tangerang.
	   Speaking to reporters after stepping out of Jakarta's Cipinang
penitentiary, Rumbiak said the sentence has made him stronger and
understood ways of resolving the problem of problems of the
disputed province.
	   Rumbiak was the third Irianese rebels got free since Tuesday,
when President B.J. Habibie granted amnesty to three other Irianese
political prisoners coinciding the 53rd Indonesian independence
anniversary.
	   They were Kasiwirus Iwob, 37, Hendrikus Kowib, 24 and Benedictus
Kua Wamba, 34, all jailed since 1997, reported the official Antara
news agency.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Medical officials raised the
number of people injured in Northern Ireland's worst terrorist
attack to more than 330 Thursday, as the shattered town of Omagh
buried the final eight victims of the car bomb slaughter.
	   Twenty-eight people died in Saturday's blast in the religiously
mixed town 70 miles (110 kms) west of Belfast, the most deadly
attack in the three decades of Northern Ireland's conflict. The
Irish Republican Army dissident gang responsible, the so-called
``Real IRA,'' is facing a security crackdown on both sides of the
Irish border.
	   Police revealed Thursday that two men were seen getting out of
the stolen car that carried the bomb and walking away 40 minutes
before the device went off on bustling Market Street. No other
details were released.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government tried to restore some
confidence in the country's shaky banking system Thursday by saying
it would fully guarantee all deposits.
	   The Central Bank proposed a system of federally backed
guarantees to discourage a run on the assets of commercial banks.
Many banks are expected to fail in the wake of the government's
decision this week to let the value of the national currency, the
ruble, fall by up to 35 percent.
	   ``We appeal to the citizens of Russia to calmly endure the
difficult challenges of the financial crisis,'' the Central Bank
said in a statement. ``We call for Russian depositors not to hurry
in shifting their deposits or withdrawing them.''
	   The ruble's value remained virtually unchanged on the Moscow
currency exchange, which is controlled by the Central Bank and sets
the official exchange rate. It was pegged at 6.995 to the U.S.
dollar.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said the effective devaluation
of the ruble and suspension of debt payments was a last-ditch
effort to avoid a full default.
	   ``If we were to continue servicing our debt and making payments
on treasury bills we would be unable to pay wages and pensions,''
Kiriyenko said in remarks broadcast by Russian television.
	   Kiriyenko held a meeting with foreign investors and top Russian
financial officials later Thursday. He said they were working on a
compromise debt payment schedule.
	   ``We're not going to refuse to return this money to them, but
act together to calmly and thoroughly analyze the real
opportunities we have,'' the prime minister told the Cabinet.
	   Russia's financial crisis deepened this month as stocks fell
sharply and investors fled Russian bonds en masse, even though
interest rates soared to 200 percent.
	   The Central Bank acknowledged Thursday that Russia's hard
currency reserves fell sharply in the days before the devaluation
was announced, shedding nearly dlrs 2 billion last week alone. They
stood at 15.1 billion last Friday, down from dlrs 17 billion on
Aug. 7.
	   It also described the extent of Russia's capital flight, saying
that between dlrs 3.5 billion and dlrs 4.5 billion were taken out
of the country legally between May and mid-August, the Interfax
news agency said.
	   To keep money in Russian banks, Central Bank Chairman Sergei
Dubinin said the government would ask commercial banks to sign
cooperation agreements with the national Sberbank and enter a pool
in which banks guarantee private deposits.
	   ``If a bank signs (such) an agreement with Sberbank, its
depositors can at any moment transfer their deposits to Sberbank,
thus falling under the state guarantee,'' Dubinin said.

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi offered
Thursday to end her roadside standoff with the military regime if
the government agrees to free jailed members of her political
party.
	   Suu Kyi's health was ``failing'' nine days into the standoff but
she was in ``high spirits,'' according to a statement released by
the National League for Democracy, her political party.
	   The offer came on the eve of the Friday deadline set by Suu Kyi
for the government to finally convene a parliament elected in 1990
but never allowed to meet, part of her renewed campaign against the
government.
	   Citing her personal physicians, who have visited Suu Kyi, 53,
twice in her van 32 kilometers (19 miles) outside Yangon, her eyes
are turning yellow and she has low blood pressure, the statement
said.
	   Doctors took blood samples, fearing she may have contracted
jaundice or another disease after spending nine days in the van
with three colleagues on a small country bridge.
	   Suu Kyi is engaged in her fourth confrontation in two months
with the military government over her right to travel freely within
Myanmar, also known as Burma. She was stopped last Wednesday as she
attempted to drive to the city of Bassein to meet members of
parliament from her party.
	   In Geneva, Switzerland, a U.N. panel of experts Thursday urged
the military regime to allow Suu Kyi and her political colleagues
to travel safely and freely within the country.
	   The Human Rights Commission's Sub-Commission on Prevention of
Discrimination and Protection of Minorities also urged the
government to allow the U.N. human rights envoy to visit Myanmar.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori will
make the first official visit by a Peruvian head of state to Poland
next month, the PAP state news agency reported Thursday.
	   Peruvian Ambassador Jorge Castaneda told PAP that Fujimori would
meet with Polish government and political leaders, including
President Aleksander Kwasniewski, during the five-day visit
beginning Sept. 10.
	   About 40 businessmen would accompany Fujimori, who will attend
the opening of a Polish-Peruvian economic forum, Castaneda said.
Trade between the countries totaled dlrs 30 million last year, and
Peru wants the figure to triple, PAP reported.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police and ethnic Albanian
rebels clashed Thursday southwest of here, and France's foreign
minister complained of delays in starting direct talks between the
two sides on the future of the rebellious Serb province.
	   International officials warned of a humanitarian catastrophe
this winter unless the violence stops and civilians can return to
their homes to harvest crops.
	   Hundreds have already died since Serbs began a crackdown on
ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo in late February. The United
Nations estimates that more than 231,000 people have been uprooted
in the months since.
	   Although the level of fighting has decreased since Serb forces
drove the Kosovo Liberation Army from key strongholds this month,
scattered clashes are continuing.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources in one KLA fighter was killed and three
were wounded, including an officer, in clashes which began
Wednesday night between the towns of Orahovac and Suva Reka, about
60 kilometers (37 miles) southwest of here.
	   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
heaviest fighting was around the villages of Zociste, Opterusa and
Samodraza. The Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said Serb
forces Thursday shelled the village of Pantina, about 28 kilometers
(17 miles) northwest of Pristina.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed, although the
government's Tanjug news agency said there were clashes between
police and ``terrorists,'' meaning the KLA.
	   Under pressure from the United States and the Europeans, the
leading Albanian politician, Ibrahim Rugova, has named a panel to
begin talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on the
future of the province.
	   The Albanians are demanding independence from Serbia, the main
republic of Yugoslavia. Milosevic has offered autonomy, which the
Europeans and Americans support.
	   But the panel, which has been rejected by the KLA, has not begun
direct talks with the Serbs and has instead been working with U.S.
diplomats to develop a platform and negotiating strategy.
	   Special U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met Thursday with Rugova and
the head of the Albanian panel, Fehmi Agani. The independent B-92
radio said Hill would meet later with Nikola Sainovic, a close aide
of Milosevic.
	   ``The door is very much open,'' Hill said when asked if the KLA
might enter the talks at a later stage. ``This is the track that is
going eventually to yield results. It is not a short-time process.
It is not an easy process. But this is the track that we are
supporting, this is the track that will eventually succeed and I
hope others will come to realize that and join us.''
	   In Paris, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine expressed
disappointment at the slow pace of the process. ``We are looking
for ... the beginning of a negotiation, which still has not
started, for this autonomy,'' Vedrine told RTL radio.
	   Despite the absence of face-to-face talks, Agani said the
process was moving forward with Hill dealing with the two sides.
	   ``This is after all the beginning of an attempt to find the
solution in talks and negotiations,'' Agani said. ``The talks are
underway in a way. They are going on through Mr. Hill independently
of some corespondence.''
	   Nevertheless, international relief organizations fear the
process may also be too slow.
	   ``We would have many, many people dying during the coming
winter,'' Soeren Jessen Petersen, a deputy to U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, said Wednesday in Pristina.
``Humanitarian action must not, once again, as it happened in
Bosnia for four or five years, become a substitute for political
action.''

Rothenberg leaves trail of success, enhanced image for American
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ He was virtually unknown in American soccer when
FIFA plucked him out of obscurity and ``encouraged'' him to run for
the U.S. Soccer Federation presidency.
	   Eight years later, Alan Rothenberg leaves his post having run
the best attended World Cup in history, started a respected
first-division pro league, and gotten the world soccer community to
stop sneering loudly at the United States.
	   ``I think Alan's greatest contribution, despite the fact that he
is not a linguist, has been his ability to represent American
soccer in the international community, and enjoy credibility never
achieved before by the United States,'' FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper
said.
	   Much of that came in 1994, when 3,567,415 people showed up to
watch World Cup games in a country where many _ Americans and
foreigners alike _ said nobody cared about the kind of football
played with a round ball.
	   The attendance was 1 million more than had ever witnessed a
World Cup before and its average crowd of 68,604 was nearly 8,000
better than the next closest championship.
	   France 98, which had 12 more games than USA 94, wasn't even
close.
	   ``When (people) look back to that ('94) Cup, they say it was the
greatest World Cup ever,'' U.S. federation secretary general Hank
Steinbrecher said. ``Alan did that. He was responsible.
	   ``If they dig deeper, they'll see the whole infrastructure (of
American soccer) improved.''
	   Rothenberg must step down from his eight-year reign as president
of the USSF on Saturday because federation rules limit him to two
four-year terms.
	   Either Dr. Bob Contiguglia or Larry Monaco, two men who have
risen through the ranks from the country's youth divisions, will
succeed Rothenberg in Saturday's election at the USSF's Annual
General Meeting in Hawaii.
	   Either will have a huge shadow to emerge from, with Rothenberg
having established a legacy of business success and even some on
the field for American soccer.
	   ``I'm pretty pleased with what's happened in the last eight
years,'' Rothenberg said. ``Every goal we established, we met. You
would like to do more, but at same time, we made some giant
strides.''
	   In 1990, two years after FIFA awarded the World Cup to the
United States, the world body did not like the look of things.
	   Officially, it merely ``encouraged'' Rothenberg, a lawyer,
former professional sports team owner, and the head of soccer at
the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, to challenge incumbent Werner
Fricker for the USSF presidency.
	   Unofficially, FIFA threatened to take away the World Cup if
Rothenberg wasn't elected.
	   With the backing of the USSF's pro division, Rothenberg narrowly
won and immediately set out to change things.
	   ``All those involved in the World Cup prior to Alan were
cautious,'' said Sunil Gulati, then an unpaid aide to Fricker and
now the deputy commissioner of Major League Soccer. ``We were going
to play in smaller stadia, 30,000, 40,000. Definitely not the Rose
Bowl.
	   ``Alan was insistent on going for much a bigger event. That
decision, if no other, was the single, biggest difference in making
money and not making money.''
	   Like the 1984 Olympics, the World Cup made a profit _ dlrs 50
million. The surplus was enough to give Rothenberg a controversial
dlrs 3 million bonus and establish the non-profit U.S. Soccer
Foundation with most of the rest.
	   Additionally, Rothenberg transformed the U.S. federation from a
small outfit run mostly by volunteers to a professional
organization with a dlrs 38 million annual budget.
	   While Fricker had started the ball rolling ever so slowly, it
was Rothenberg who added sponsors, television exposure and a pro
league to change the stature of American soccer in the United
States and abroad.
	   The United States regularly qualifies for all FIFA competitions
and even wins some, like the 1991 Women's World Championship and
the 1996 women's Olympic title. Last Sunday, two-time MLS champion
D.C. United won CONCACAF's annual club title only 2 1-2 years after
Rothenberg established the league.
	   With MLS and national team games, soccer is broadcast regularly
on television.
	   In the last year, multi-million dollar deals with Nike and IMG
have secured the federation's finances well into the next century.
	   Rothenberg even sees the debacle at France 98, when the
Americans lost all three games to Germany, Iran and Yugoslavia, as
a positive.
	   ``Even after the U.S. was eliminated, American media clearly
accepted the World Cup as an enormous event. They clearly accept
soccer as a mainstream sport,'' he said.
	   ``The amount of press on the so-called coaching controversy is
daily. Nobody gave a damn eight years ago.''
	   The U.S. coach's job is still an unsettled affair. After Steve
Sampson resigned following the Americans' last-place finish in
France, Rothenberg vowed to name a replacement before he left.
	   Now, that seems unlikely.
	   Besides the coach, Rothenberg leaves several tasks for his
successor, namely next year's women's World Cup and Project 2010,
an idea he dreamed up following the 1994 World Cup to put the
United States in a position to host and win the World Cup by the
end of the next decade.
	   Rothenberg almost assuredly will not fade into the grass of
American soccer. Besides his advisory post as a USSF
past-president, he has purchased the San Jose Clash of the MLS
along with Japanese firm Dentsu and 1984 Olympics buddy Peter
Uebberoth.
	   But don't expect to see him back running the 2010 World Cup
should the United States get it.
	   ``I'd be happy to take a gold pass and sit in the tribune of
honor with my grandchildren,'' he says. ``Once is enough.''

Japan transfers medical equipment to Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Japanese officials on Thursday presented
Ukraine's Defense Ministry with dlrs 3.6 million in medical
equipment under a program to dismantle the country's nuclear
weapons facilities.
	   The shipment, including anesthetic equipment, a dialysis machine
and ultrasound diagnostic devices, will be used in military
hospitals in Kiev, Odessa, Lviv, Chernihiv and other locations in
Ukraine.
	   The Japanese government has allocated dlrs 16 million for
Ukraine under an international program to assist the country in
getting rid of the former Soviet nuclear arsenal, the world's third
largest, and its infrastructure. The program also helps Ukraine
convert defense industries to civilian uses.
	   Ukraine has surrendered all its nuclear warheads to Russia but
still has to dismantle some missiles and missile bases.
	   Since 1995, Japan has provided Ukraine with dlrs 10 million in
medical equipment and supplies, according to the Interfax news
agency.

CNN to disappear from Amsterdam's screens in cable fee dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with CNN confirming pullout, quotes
from TBS executive. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Cable News Network said Thursday
it will pull out of Amsterdam on Aug. 25 because of a fee dispute,
making the Dutch capital the only major European city without its
round-the-clock coverage.
	   In a statement, CNN harshly criticized a demand from Amsterdam's
A2000 cable network requiring a 700,000 guilder (dlrs 350,000) a
year fee and said it would refuse to pay.
	   ``The conditions for renewal imposed by A2000 are so
disproportionate with those negotiated with every other cable and
satellite platform operator anywhere in the world that we had no
option but to withdraw,'' said Phil Kent, president of Turner
Broadcasting System International.
	   ``As a result of A2000's unacceptable demands, the citizens,
diplomats, tourists and business travelers of a major European
capital city will no longer be able to receive the world's leading
24-hour news and information network,'' he said.
	   CNN's decision to pull the plug in Amsterdam follows music
channel MTV Europe, which went off the air earlier this month for
the same reason.
	   Eurosport and The Discovery Channel also have pulled out of
Amsterdam for the same reasons.
	   Calls to A2000 Thursday evening were answered with a message
that said its employees were in meeting and unable to respond.
	   It was not immediately clear whether Amsterdam's city council
would intervene in any way. CNN has become hugely popular in the
Netherlands and is widely watched both by the Dutch and foreign
visitors, and its loss could potentially deal a serious blow to the
hotel industry.
	   ``After 10 years of distributing CNN's very popular
international service in Amsterdam, it sorrows us that we have to
take this decision,'' said Mathieu Nagelkerke, vice president of
channel operations for TBS Netherlands.
	   CNN will continue to be available via satellite in Amsterdam,
but because it and other popular channels traditionally were
offered on basic cable menus, relatively few people in the capital
have reception dishes.

Taliban claim advances north of Kabul, deny targeting minorities
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Taliban fighters fought their way
further up the Salong Highway, Afghanistan's north-south artery, a
spokesman said Thursday.
	   Spokesman Ahmed Javed, reached by telephone in the southern
Afghan city of Kandahar, said nine opposition fighters were killed
and 55 captured in Thursday's battle. He said the Taliban captured
three towns _ Khanjan, Doshakk and Dara Walian _ in the fighting
north of Kabul. He had no details on Taliban casualties.
	   There was no immediate confirmation of the report.
	   The fighting was near Doshi, 160 kilometers (100 miles)
northwest of Kabul, which the Taliban claimed to have captured Aug.
15. Doshi was a crucial link between opposition forces holed up in
northern Panjshir valley and their allies in central Bamiyan
province.
	   A Taliban diplomat, meanwhile, denied his fighters slaughtered
civilians in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif, and said
journalists would soon be allowed to go there.
	   ``It is just propaganda that we indulged in human rights
violations or committed atrocities against minority ethnic
groups,'' Maulvi Saeed-ur-Rahman Haqqani, the Taliban's ambassador
to neighboring Pakistan, told The Associated Press.
	   ``They are our own people. How can we commit atrocities against
them?'' he said.
	   The anti-Taliban alliance and media in Iran, which is believed
to back the alliance, have accused Taliban fighters of killing
hundreds of people belonging to ethnic minority groups in
Mazar-e-Sharif, the biggest city in the north. The Taliban capture
of Mazar-e-Sharif earlier this month was one in a string of
victories that put the extremist Islamic fighters close to
controlling all of Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban, like most Afghans, are ethnic Pashtuns. The
anti-Taliban northern alliance has mostly ethnic Tajiks, Uzbeks and
Hazaras in its ranks. The Taliban are Sunni Muslim, while the
alliance includes Muslims who adhere to the Shiite sect.
	   Amnesty International this week called on the Taliban to allow
outsiders into Mazar-e-Sharif, citing the reports of mass killings
and saying secretiveness ``could serve to conceal the human rights
violations in the area.''
	   ``We are not allowing journalists to visit Mazar-e-Sharif at
present only to protect their lives,'' Haqqani said. ``The
situation is calm there, but we want to further ensure peace before
we allow visitors.''
	   Taliban authorities have allowed an international Red Cross team
into Mazar-e-Sharif, but only to drop off relief goods.

Havel calls public protests in 1968 a ``remarkable phenomenon''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel said
Thursday the public resistance to the 1968 Soviet-led invasion that
crushed the Prague Spring reforms was a ``remarkable phenomenon.''
	   In a speech marking the 30-year anniversary of the invasion,
Havel fondly remembered Czechoslovakia's brief political thaw as a
glimpse of freedom that forever changed the face of communism.
	   ``For me, the short period (of the Prague Spring) was a time
when one could breathe and speak again after 20 years,'' Havel
said. ``Nobody who lived in that era can ever forget it.''
	   Havel said the Prague Spring was considered an even more
important historical milestone abroad, because it ``revealed what
`Communism' really means, it revealed its totalitarian character.''
	   The Czechoslovak government was founded in 1948 modeled on the
Soviet political system, where the Communist Party functioned as
the only real political force. All efforts were made to politicize
all aspects of life.
	   In late 1967 Czech intellectuals and party leaders, under the
direction of Alexander Dubcek, tried to put a more human face on
communism, allowing free speech and assembly over a period of nine
months that became known as the Prague Spring.
	   Fearing reforms would spread to their countries, the Soviet
Union and its Warsaw Pact allies invaded with troops on Aug. 21.
About a hundred people were killed, and Dubcek was deposed. The
country then experienced 21 years of political stagnation under
hard-line communists.
	   Communism collapsed in Czechoslovakia in late 1989 and in Jan.
1993, the country peacefully split into the independent countries
of Czech Republic and Slovakia.

French truckers plan to block borders crossings Sept. 8
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French truckers said Thursday they plan to block or
obstruct European border crossings Sept. 8, in a push to reduce
their work week to 48 hours and harmonize industry regulations
Europe-wide.
	   There remains some organizing to be arranged between truckers'
unions in differing European countries on blockades. But past
trucker protests in France, a major European transit axis, have
stymied traffic Europe-wide.
	   ``The border between France and Luxembourg will feature a
slowdown, but the one between Strasbourg and Germany will block
traffic completely,'' said Michel Fleurot, the action coordinator
at the French Labor Confederation (CFDT).
	   Turning to the Franco-Spanish border, Roger Poletti, head of the
French union Workers Force trucking division said ``we agree in
substance (with the Spanish), but the timing details still need to
be set.''
	   The blockades, which are planned to last 24 hours, are part of
an ``action day'' organized by the International Transport
Federation (ITF) and the European Federation of Transport Unions
(FST). The protest will also include tract distribution and other
publicity activities.
	   ``It's up to the individual unions to organize activities
nationally depending on the involvement of their membership and
their financial resources,'' the ITF's Graham Brothers said. The
ITF represents around 300,000 truckers in both Eastern and Western
Europe.
	   The CFDT, which is France's largest trucking union, hopes to
mobilize around 1,500 of the union's 16,000 registered truckers
Sept. 8. Fleurot said the truckers are asking that the 48-hour work
week include not only driving time, but also time spent loading,
unloading, waiting at border crossing and delivery sites.
	   ``Truckers in Europe work an average of 61 hours a week'' which
leads to safety problems on the road and health problems from the
fatigue and occupational ailments, Fleurot said.
	   The CFDT said it also hopes to bring attention to the need to
harmonize work regulations within the European Union ahead of the
next EU road transport meeting between trucking unions and
management Sept. 18.

Social Democrats pledge to undo reforms of Kohl era if elected
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos BER106-107, 112-113 &QL; 
 &UR; By COLLEEN BARRY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Chancellor hopeful Gerhard Schroeder pledged
Thursday to swiftly undo key elements of the conservative
government's reforms that he says have put an unfair burden on the
weakest elements of society.
	   Reflecting both his social welfare ideals and his own
unprivileged upbringing in postwar Germany, Schroeder promised
programs to help single-parent families, widowed pensioners and
smaller business owners, among others.
	   At the heart of Schroeder's plan for the first 100 days of a new
Social Democratic government _ the first in 16 years if he beats
Chancellor Helmut Kohl Sept. 27 _ is a tax reform designed to spur
the economy and reduce unemployment.
	   With joblessness running at 10.7 percent, Schroeder also
promised to renew efforts to create jobs through dialogue between
employers, unions and the government.
	   Calling Kohl's promise to cut personal and corporate taxes by 30
billion marks (dlrs 17 billion) ``untenable,'' Schroeder pledged
gradual cuts of his own that would total a third of that.
	   Schroeder cautioned that 100 days wasn't enough to achieve his
tax reform. ``But we will begin to tackle things.''
	   ``There aren't any unrealistic promises,'' Schroeder told a news
conference.
	   Critics in Kohl's government assailed the program as disastrous.
	   Peter Hintze, general secretary of Kohl's Christian Democrats,
warned that repealing reforms Kohl has pushed through on sick pay,
pensions and restrictions on firing workers would be ``stomping on
the seedlings of recovery.''
	   ``These reforms were a bitter medicine but they had an effect,''
Hintze said.
	   But Schroeder said reversing those reforms as part of his 100
day program would cost 1.5 billion marks (dlrs 830 million), only
0.3 percent of the federal budget.
	   And the benefits from stronger economic growth and lower
unemployment would more than offset the costs, he insisted.
	   Individuals Schroeder said had been dealt a tough hand by Kohl
got special mention throughout the program: unemployed youth,
workers who fall ill, widows, smaller business owners.
	   Schroeder announced plans to address rising youth unemployment
with training programs, to repeal unpopular cuts in sick pay and
pension payments, to reduce the tax burden on businesses, and to
reward those who create jobs by allowing a portion of profits to be
untaxed.
	   His plan to raise the pensions for widows _ an average 900 to
1,400 marks (dlrs 500 to dlrs 775) a month _ strongly resonated his
own upbringing by a mother widowed within days of Schroeder's birth
during World War II.
	   ``I say this with deliberate emotion .... These women, who
raised their children after the war in the most difficult
circumstances, now retire at the lowest levels of society,''
Schroeder said.
	   Chances for a Social Democratic victory are the best since the
war, Schroeder said, pointing to a ``solid lead'' in polls of three
to five percentage points over Kohl's conservative union.
	   How quickly the Social Democrats would be able to push through
reforms depends on whether they and the likely coalition partner,
the Greens, win enough votes to form a government, or if the Social
Democrats would be forced to enter a grand coalition with Kohl's
Christian Democrats.
	   The Greens welcomed the Schroeder's program, in particular the
plans to make jobs. But party leader Gunda Roestel suggested a
point of disagreement should the two parties wind up in a
coalition: the cost of implementing the tax and pension reforms.

Tropical storm watches posted for some of the Leeward Islands
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Rewrites throughout to UPDATE with 11 a.m. position, strength,
forward speed, rainbands hitting some islands. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ A tropical depression moving across the Atlantic
Ocean northeastward of the Lesser Antilles was expected to become a
tropical storm late Thursday, forecasters said.
	   Tropical storm watches were in effect for Antigua, Barbuda,
Anguilla, St. Maarten, Saba and St. Eustatius, but the main part of
the system was expected to pass offshore.
	   Outer rainbands of the depression began spreading over portions
of the Leewards during the morning, accompanied by locally heavy
showers and some squalls.
	   The weather system had steady winds of 35 mph (56 kph) at 11
a.m. EDT Thursday and was located about 250 miles (400 kilometers)
east-northeast of the Leeward Islands, moving west-northwest at
about 23 mph (37 kph).
	   The depression will become Tropical Storm Bonnie if it reaches
steady winds of 39 mph (62 kph). It would be the second tropical
storm of the season.
	   The system's track would likely put it east of the Bahamas by
the weekend, forecasters said.
	   The National Hurricane Center planned to send out a plane early
Thursday afternoon to study the depression.
	   Forecasters are also watching four other tropical waves, or low
pressure systems, that rose up earlier this week.
	   The Atlantic hurricane season began in June and ends in
November.
	   The season's first, Tropical Storm Alex, fizzled out before it
reached the Caribbean earlier this month.

Ukrainian officials seek to limit ruble circulation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads with 3 grafs to UPDATE with Yeltsin-Kuchma phone
conversation. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The presidents of Russia and Ukraine
discussed Russia's currency crisis and measures to counter it
during a long telephone conversation on Thursday.
	   Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kuchma agreed on the need to coordinate
their efforts and promised to inform one other about problems than
might affect their economies, Kuchma's press service said.
	   Ukraine is deeply worried about the Russian financial crisis.
Earlier Thursday, an official said Ukraine's Economics Ministry has
worked out a plan to protect the country's economy and is advising
businesses to limit their ruble transactions.
	   Deputy Economics Minister Leonid Mynin refused to disclose
details of the plan, saying it covered ``the whole spectrum of
relations with Russia.''
	   But he said the ministry was recommending Ukrainians do business
in foreign currencies instead of rubles, ``and to sign revised
contracts with their Russian partners urgently.''
	   Most businesses were complying, Mynin said.
	   Ukraine also might seek to restructure its debt to Russia
because of losses suffered when the ruble was effectively devalued
by more than one-third this week, he said in remarks cited by the
Interfax news agency.
	   Russia is Ukraine's main economic partner and accounted for 32
percent of its total exports in 1997.
	   Ukrainian officials have voiced concerns that Russia's ruble
devaluation might undermine the stability of Ukraine's hryvna
currency and cause more foreign investors to leave the country's
shaky financial markets.
	   The hryvna slipped from 2.1435 to the U.S. dollar last week to
2.225 on Wednesday. There was no dollar trade at the interbank
currency exchange on Thursday.
	   The government and the National Bank said in a statement
Wednesday that Ukraine's market conditions were substantially
different from those in Russia and vowed to protect the country's
economy and currency.
	   ``There are no grounds for panic,'' said Mynin.

 &UR; Arron thinks women's 100 record is practically out of reach &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Christine Arron, who has just become
the third fastest woman in history, believes the world 100-meter
record of 10.49 seconds set by Florence Griffith-Joyner is out of
her reach.
	   ``It's a quite extraordinary result,'' Arron said Thursday.
``I've never thought I could beat the world record.''
	   The 24-year-old French woman with orange-dyed hair set a
European record of 10.73 in winning the 100 at the European
Championship on Wednesday.
	   Griffith-Joyner, who set the world record in 1988, also has the
next three fastest times in history.
	   Marion Jones, the U.S. star who is the world champion, has the
next times behind Griffith-Joyner _ 10.71 and 10.72 run two times
each this year.
	   Arron said she's always doubted the validity of Flo-Jo's world
record.
	   Some reports say the record was set in very strong tail wind
that had not been properly registered. But the time was officially
recognized.
	   ``I have always had doubts about that performance,'' Arron said.
	   But if the world record is unassailable, Arron feels capable of
attacking 10.61, Flo-Jo's second fastest time.
	   ``I am sure I can go under 10.70. That's closer, that's more
within my reach. If I get under 10.68, then I'll think about it,''
she said.
	   The Guadeloupe native is expected to provide the stiffest
challenge to Jones in the years to come.
	   Unlike Jones, Arron does not compete in the long jump and rarely
runs the 200.
	   ``I don't think I am capable of doing all that. What she is
doing is monumental. I am not that strong,'' Arron said.
	   ``I am not obsessed with beating Jones. I am sure it will happen
one day,'' she said.
	   Arron said she wants to concentrate on the 100 and try to beat
Jones at next year's worlds and especially at the 2000 Olympics in
Sydney, where Jones may go for five gold medals.
	   ``It's great what she wants to do, but I want the 100. She can
have all the others. She can go for anything she likes, but I want
only one _ the 100,'' Arron said.
	   ``I think I have all the qualities she has, but I have to work
on my starts and other technical points _ the way I hold my arms,
my hips,'' she said.
	   Jones and Arron are likely to clash in the 100 at the Berlin
meet Sept. 1.
	   Arron first caught attention at last year's worlds when she
finished fourth.
	   ``But I did not explode from one day to the other. I've been in
athletics for 11 years and I've head a steady progression,'' she
said.
	   Arron said she was tested for banned drugs on the eve of her
race here.
	   ``I support such tests. I think it's good that you get tested
before a race too,'' she said.
	   Arron nearly quit in frustration when she was hobbled by a
series of injuries in 1993 and 1994. She switched to the 400 for
some time, and also ran the 200, unsuccessfully. She was injured
again in 1996 and had to miss the Atlanta Olympics.

Tobagan striker moves to Reds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yorke agreeing 5-year deal, adds exact transfer
fee &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Manchester United Thursday hired
Aston Villa striker Dwight Yorke for 12.6 million pounds (dlrs 20.8
million).
	   Manager Alex Ferguson persuade the Tobagan star to sign a
five-year contract in time for a midnight deadline so that Yorke
can play in the next round of the European Champions Cup.
	   Villa originally wanted 16 million pounds (dlrs 26.4 million)
for its longest serving player, a fee which would have beaten the
British transfer record 15 million (24.75 million) Newcastle paid
Blackburn Rovers for Alan Shearer two years ago.
	   In a long-running transfer wrangle, United originally offered a
little over half that and the two clubs eventually agreed a price
on Thursday.
	   The transfer means that Ferguson has spent 27 million pounds
(dlrs 44.5 million) on three players during the summer.
	   He also hired Dutch defender Jaap Stam for 10 million pounds
(dlrs 16.5 million) and Swedish winger Jesper Blomqvist for 4.5
million (dlrs 7.4 million). He also agreed a 9 million pounds (dlrs
14.8 million) with AC Milan for Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert but
the player turned down the move.
	   Yorke joined Villa in 1990 from the Tobagan club St. Clair's as
a 17-year-old. In the last three seasons, he has scored 46 league
goals for the Birmingham club.
	   During his spell at Villa Park, Yorke played under five
different managers _ Graham Taylor, who went on to become England
coach, Josef Venglos, Ron Atkinson, Brian Little and current
manager John Gregory.
	   ``Once he had stated publicly he wanted to play for Manchester
United and not Aston Villa I had no other option but to agree to
his transfer,'' Gregory said Thursday.
	   ``Personally it was a big letdown that a player didn't want to
play for me.''

On post-Cold War stage, Castro plays elderly Caribbean statesman

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Half a century ago,
Fidel Castro tried to reach the Dominican Republic in a boat filled
with armed revolutionaries, Dominican and Cuban, intent on ousting
the military dictator in Santo Domingo.
	   On Thursday, Castro arrived on his first trip to the Dominican
Republic since becoming Cuba's leader in 1959, to a red-carpet
welcome from an honor guard, a military brass band and a 21-gun
salute.
	   ``To be here in the Dominican Republic, I can hardly believe it!
It's been my lifelong dream,'' Castro, in his trademark camouflage
fatigues and cap, said after reviewing the troops.
	   Dominican President Leonel Fernandez, among dozens of
dignitaries who greeted Castro, thanked him for that long-ago
attempt to liberate the neighboring island and urged him to ``feel
right at home.''
	   Playing elder statesman on a smaller stage than he sought during
the Cold War, Castro is championing the neglected causes of his
Caribbean neighbors at a 16-nation summit this week.
	   Coming off a triumphant Caribbean tour in which he railed
against the dangers that unbridled capitalism poses to small island
states, Castro will get a warm reception here. The Caribbean
Community trade bloc and the Dominican Republic, shunning
Washington's isolation of Castro, say it's time to bring communist
Cuba back into the regional fold.
	   Many Caribbean countries have recently renewed trade and
diplomatic ties with Cuba _ most recently the Dominican Republic,
which restored full relations in April after a 34-year lapse.
	   These countries want Cuba's help in bargaining for aid and trade
incentives for their banana and sugar exports to the European
Union.
	   But rain-soaked Castro posters aren't the only thing greeting
the 72-year-old leader here. Bomb-sniffing Cuban dog squads,
Dominican riot police and rumored assassination plots have tinged
Castro's welcome.
	   Anti-Castro Cuban exiles in the United States are using the
occasion to condemn his human rights record _ and Caribbean
democracies for embracing him.
	   ``Once again we are raising our voice to repudiate the attitude
of democratic governments for inviting a dictator,'' declared the
Casa Jose Marti, a Puerto Rico-based exile group.
	   On Wednesday, the organization asked Dominican authorities for
permission to fly a plane over Santo Domingo floating a banner
declaring, ``Fidel Castro: dictator and assassin.''
	   Dominican police last week said they arrested a man in a Castro
assassination plot, while The Miami Herald reported a similar
supposed plot by Cuban exiles. The U.S. Embassy warned in July of a
plan to bomb an airliner serving Santo Domingo and Havana.
	   Sergio Ramos, a Puerto Rico-based Cuban exile, accused the
Dominican and Cuban governments of fomenting a scare to depict
``every Cuban opposed to Castro's tyranny as a terrorist.''
	   Officials of the Caribbean Community, a dlrs 18 billion market,
hope to gently press Castro on Friday and Saturday to enact
political reforms. The summit, spokesman Leonard Robertson said,
follows ``our policy of dialogue and constructive engagement with
Cuba.''
	   Fernandez, who has worked closely with Washington on trade, drug
trafficking and money laundering, has criticized the U.S. embargo
of Cuba.
	   Fernandez's political party has long ties to Cuba: Its founder,
former Dominican President Juan Bosch, was once exiled there and
led the failed 1947 expedition in which Castro took part. The boat
was stopped and the dissidents disbanded before they left Cuban
waters.
	   Caribbean nations once wary of Castro's revolutionary designs
now feel safe embracing him, especially at a time when Washington
has slashed aid to the region.
	   Nowhere is the rapprochement more apparent than in the Dominican
Republic, which lies just 160 miles (260 kilometers) southeast of
Cuba and shares cultural and historic ties.
	   Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista fled to the Dominican Republic
after his ouster by Castro on Jan. 1, 1959. In June 1959, Castro
sponsored a small invasion against then-Dominican dictator Rafael
Trujillo, whose military annihilated the invading force. Two months
later, Trujillo backed Cuban exiles in a frustrated attempt to
overthrow Castro.
	   For years, former Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer refused
to normalize relations with Cuba. This week, the two are expected
to meet.

Siemens completes purchase of Westinghouse Power
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Siemens AG has completed its dlrs 1.2
billion acquisition of the Westinghouse Power Generation business
from U.S. media group CBS Corp., Siemens said Thursday.
	   The acquisition will allow Siemens to expand its non-nuclear
power plant business by dlrs 2 billion to an annual sales volume of
dlrs 6.0 billion, it said in a statement.
	   Westinghouse Power Generation will continue to be based in
Orlando, Florida, but will be renamed Siemens Westinghouse Power
Corp., it said.
	   SWPC will also incorporate the fossil power division of Siemens
Power Corp. in Milwaukee, while SPC continues the group's nuclear
operations, it said.
	   The Siemens Power Generation Group is one of Siemens's four
troubled divisions that were the focus of the group's recently
published 10-point restructuring plan.

Peres: massive expansion of Golan settlements a `provocation'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu defending decision to expand Golan
settlements &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's decision to build 4,800 new homes in
the Golan Heights and effectively double the Israeli population
there is a ``provocation'' against Syria, former Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres said Thursday.
	   A former Israeli peace negotiator, Itamar Rabinovich, told the
Haaretz daily that Syria had been weighing whether to resume peace
talks with Israel, and would now be spooked for good.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended Wednesday's decision
by a ministerial committee to approve the construction of 2,300
homes and 2,500 vacation units in four Golan settlements.
	   ``We have an ongoing policy, and it has not changed. It has
always included the building, or rather the expansion of
settlements in the Golan,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Israel captured the heights from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war
and annexed the area in 1981.
	   Peres, a former key figure in peace negotiations with Syria,
said the government's decision was ``superfluous, irritating and
unnecessary.''
	   ``Either they (government officials) should stop singing
serenades under Syria's window or they should stop indulging in
provocations,'' Peres told The Associated Press.

New Cabinet sworn in by Jordan's Crown Prince

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's new Prime Minister, Fayez
Tarawneh, was sworn in Thursday, taking office with a government
where the biggest change was in the finance ministry.
	   Crown Prince Hassan officiated at the Cabinet's swearing-in,
palace officials said. The prince is deputizing for King Hussein
who is receiving cancer treatment in the United States.
	   The government of Prime Minister Abdul-Salam Majali resigned
Wednesday after a public outcry over polluted drinking water in the
capital, Amman, and parliamentary accusations that it had misled
the country about economic growth.
	   Tarawneh, 50, has held several previous Cabinet posts, including
foreign affairs and was the chief Jordanian negotiator in the talks
that culminated in the Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty of 1994. He
has also served as ambassador to the United States.
	   The new 23-person Cabinet is dominated by liberal politicians
and technocrats, according to palace officials.
	   The most significant change is a new economic team, headed by
Finance Minister Michel Marto. Deemed to be more influential than
his predecessor because of his role in spearheading reforms, Marto
is credited with improving Jordan's hard currency reserves during
his time at the treasury in the late 1980s.
	   The former team ran into trouble after it said the economy grew
by 4 percent in 1997. The World Bank said the rate did not exceed
0.8 percent.
	   The new foreign minister is Abdul-Illah Khatib, a liberal
politician. But the change is unlikely to have any major impact as
King Hussein normally handles foreign affairs and Tarawneh is known
to follow Hussein's moderate policies.
	   The new Water Minister, Hani Mulqi, is known as a dynamic
politician who maintained a clean record as Minister of Trade,
Industry and Supply.
	   The full Cabinet was expected to be announced later Thursday.
	   Majali told reporters earlier that his ``resignation has no
relation to either the water problem or the growth rate reports.''
	   ``I am happily satisfied with my performance and my government
concurs,'' Majali said, adding that he resigned because ``this
period needs new endeavor and new policies.''
	   Residents of Amman's wealthy western suburbs had complained that
tap water was giving off a foul odor and experts said it contained
worms and larvae. The former government denied the accusations, but
the king appointed a commission of enquiry, which reported hours
before Majali's resignation. The report has not been released.

CNN to disappear from Amsterdam's screens in cable fee dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with TBS spokesman saying irate
Dutch viewers forming protest groups. ADDS byline. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By WILLIAM J. KOLE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Cable News Network said Thursday
it will pull out of Amsterdam next week because of a fee dispute,
making the Dutch capital the only major European city without its
round-the-clock coverage.
	   In a statement, CNN International harshly criticized a demand
from Amsterdam's A2000 cable network requiring a 700,000 guilder
(dlrs 350,000) a year fee and said it would refuse to pay.
	   ``The conditions for renewal imposed by A2000 are so
disproportionate with those negotiated with every other cable and
satellite platform operator anywhere in the world that we had no
option but to withdraw,'' said Phil Kent, president of Turner
Broadcasting System International.
	   ``As a result of A2000's unacceptable demands, the citizens,
diplomats, tourists and business travelers of a major European
capital city will no longer be able to receive the world's leading
24-hour news and information network,'' he said.
	   CNN's decision to pull the plug in Amsterdam on Aug. 25 follows
music channel MTV Europe, which went off the air earlier this month
for the same reason. Eurosport and The Discovery Channel also have
pulled out of Amsterdam for the same reasons.
	   Calls to A2000 Thursday evening were answered with a message
that said its employees were in meeting and unable to respond.
	   TBS Europe spokesman Matthijs Spits said his office in The Hague
was deluged with calls from irate viewers.
	   ``People are saying they're going to start action groups to
protest and try to keep CNN on cable,'' he said. ``They're angry.
It's as though the only car in town has been taken away, and now
they have to walk.''
	   CNN ``doesn't pay a dime, not even a nickel or a penny'' to
cable operators in the other 180 world capitals in which it
broadcasts, Spit said. In the Netherlands, it airs news programs
without taking local advertising and therefore has no revenue to
offset what it considers an exorbitant cable user fee, he said.
	   It was not immediately clear whether Amsterdam's mayor or city
council would intervene in any way. CNN has become hugely popular
in the Netherlands and is widely watched both by the Dutch and
foreign visitors, and its loss could potentially deal a serious
blow to the hotel industry.
	   ``After 10 years of distributing CNN's very popular
international service in Amsterdam, it sorrows us that we have to
take this decision,'' said Mathieu Nagelkerke, vice president of
channel operations for TBS Netherlands.
	   CNN will continue to be available via satellite in Amsterdam,
but because it and other popular channels traditionally were
offered on basic cable menus, relatively few people in the capital
have reception dishes.

Senior Iraqi journalist detained in Baghdad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A senior Iraqi journalist who worked closely
with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's son Odai has been detained in
Baghdad, Egyptian editors and Iraqi dissidents said Thursday.
	   That said the journalist, Dawoud al-Farhan, was taken from his
office at the Information Ministry last month and that efforts by
his family to determine his whereabouts have failed.
	   They also said no reason was given for his detention, but they
noted that al-Farhan recently he wrote several columns alleging
corruption and embezzlement in the government. They spoke on
condition their names not be used.
	   Al-Farhan was deputy of the Iraqi Journalists Union, which Odai
chairs.
	   Al-Farhan also worked as a reporter in Baghdad for Egypt's
Middle East News Agency. Editors at MENA in Cairo confirmed that he
had been detained but said they did not believe it was related to
his work with the agency.
	   Al-Farhan started his career in the 1960s as a reporter for the
Nasserite Sawat Al-Arab newspaper.
	   He later was appointed managing editor of the state-owned
Al-Jumhouria daily, then deputy editor of the Iraqi News Agency.
	   He was a press attache at the Iraqi Embassy in Cairo for two
years starting in 1988.
	   Al-Farhan's columns are published in the daily Al-Iraq and in
weekly Al-Mousawar Al-Arabi.

Vietnamese president to visit Moscow next week

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Tran Duc Luong of Vietnam will hold
talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin during a visit to Russia
next week, the Interfax news agency said Thursday.
	   Luong is scheduled to arrive in Moscow on Monday and leave on
Aug. 29, it said quoting the Russian Foreign Ministry.
	   Luong is also scheduled to lay a wreath at a monument to Ho Chi
Minh and visit the Russian Academy of Sciences, where he will be
made an honorary professor.

SairGroup reports rise in net profit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's SAirGroup, which
includes national airline Swissair, Thursday reported a 16.5
percent rise in net profit to 109 million Swiss francs (dlrs 72.7
million) in the first half of 1998.
	   Over the same period, revenues rose 11 percent to 5.34 billion
Swiss francs (dlrs 3.56 billion) from 4.80 billion Swiss francs
(dlrs 3.2 billion), while operating profit rose a fifth to 302
billion Swiss francs (dlrs 201.3 billion) from 251 billion Swiss
francs (dlrs 167.3 billion).
	   SAirGroup traced the favorable result to economic recovery in
Europe and the sound shape of the U.S. economy. But some parts of
the business suffered from economic problems in Asia, SAirGroup
said in a press release.
	   The group is optimistic about the second half, which
traditionally brings higher revenues. SAirGroup plans to broaden
and deepen its strategy of building up alliances with other
airlines.
	   In July and June, the firm announced partnerships with Japan
Airlines and Hong Kong based carrier Cathay Pacific.
	   It also has struck alliances with Delta Airlines in the United
States, Austrian Airlines, Belgium's Sabena, Air Portugal, Turkish
Airlines and AOM of France.

Peres: massive expansion of Golan settlements a `provocation'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's decision to build 4,800 new homes in
the Golan Heights and effectively double the Israeli population
there is a ``provocation'' against Syria, former Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres said Thursday.
	   A former Israeli peace negotiator, Itamar Rabinovich, told the
Haaretz daily that Syria had been weighing whether to resume peace
talks with Israel, and would now be spooked for good.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended Wednesday's decision
by a ministerial committee to approve the construction of 2,300
homes and 2,500 vacation units in four Golan settlements.
	   ``We have an ongoing policy, and it has not changed. It has
always included the building, or rather the expansion of
settlements in the Golan,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Israel captured the heights from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war
and annexed the area in 1981.
	   Peres, a former key figure in peace negotiations with Syria,
said the government's decision was ``superfluous, irritating and
unnecessary.''
	   ``Either they (government officials) should stop singing
serenades under Syria's window or they should stop indulging in
provocations,'' Peres told The Associated Press.
	   Earlier this week, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
twice urged Syria to resume peace talks that were suspended in
February 1996. In an interview with a German news magazine,
Mordechai also hinted that his government had softened its position
on a troop withdrawal in the Golan.
	   Syria wants to get back all of the Golan in exchange for a peace
treaty with Israel. Syria says that when the talks broke off in
1996, the Peres government had given the Syrians to understand that
for a full peace agreement, they could expect to get all of the
Golan.
	   The Syrians insist that the Netanyahu government recognize the
understandings Damascus reached with the previous Israeli
government. Netanyahu has refused to do so and has said continued
control over the Golan is vital for Israel's security.
	   Sharon's spokesman, Raanan Gissin, said the decision to build
more homes in the Golan came in response to public demand. ``Many
people want to live in this beautiful part of the country, and we
are working to fulfill that need,'' Gissin said.

Asian economic troubles shaking Guyanese timber market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ The Asian winds of economic recession
are blowing through the South American forests of Guyana, as timber
industry experts warn markets and investors from the Far East are
evaporating.
	   Local firms that were booming with plywood sales six months ago
now say they are now seeing orders cancelled and stock piling up in
warehouses.
	   ``To put in bluntly, the industry is in economic recession,''
said David Persaud of the Guyana Forest Producers Association.
``This threatens the viability of many of our major timber
companies and the livelihood of hundreds of Guyanese workers.''
	   Before 1998's Asian economic troubles, the timber industry
contributed 4.6 percent of Guyana's gross domestic product. This
year it is likely to drop to just over 2 percent, the Guyana
Forestry Commission estimated.
	   Most of the logging firms flocking to Guyana during the last
five years have been from Malaysia, Korea, China and other Asian
countries. It now looks unlikely that many of them will be able to
deliver on promises of new sawmills, port facilities and jobs.
	   Barama Company Ltd., a joint venture operation between South
Korea's Sunkyong and Samling of Malaysia, has laid off dozens of
workers, including line managers. The company is one of the biggest
plywood ventures in the Caribbean and has investments there worth
almost dlrs 100 million.
	   Three of Barama's local rivals _ Toolsie Bersaud Ltd.,
Mazharally &AMP; Sons and Case Timbers Ltd. _ say they may also have to
lay off almost 1,000 workers to stay afloat.
	   Industry officials are asking President Janet Jagan's government
to soften the blow by easing duties on fuel and imported spare
parts. They have also asked for dlrs 100 million in soft loans,
including help to set up a communal drying kiln for all the
companies to use, which would allow them to export additional types
of lumber.
	   Analysts say the timber companies have little in the way of a
local market to fall back on because builders in the Caribbean have
been shifting toward concrete.

South Africa reports progress in Congo peace initiative
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa is making headway in
brokering a cease-fire in Congo, President Nelson Mandela said
Thursday, while his foreign minister warned of a wider crisis if
the bloodshed isn't stopped.
	   The war in Congo has already caused friction on the continent,
with Congo President Laurent Kabila accusing Rwanda and Uganda of
supporting the rebels, Zimbabwe pledging to support Kabila with
soldiers and weapons, and South Africa ruling out military
intervention.
	   South Africa's stance has ruffled Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe, who on Thursday said those who refuse to intervene
militarily should ``be silent.''
	   Mandela, who dispatched his foreign and defense ministers to
Uganda and Rwanda this week, said he expected Ugandan President
Yoweri Museveni to call for a cease-fire by rebels in Congo.
	   Whether or not the rebels would heed such a call was unclear.
But it could be a building point for talks between Kabila, Museveni
and Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu. Congo rebels have offered
to discuss peace with Kabila, but the Congolese leader reportedly
wants to talk instead with Rwandan and Ugandan leaders.
	   Earlier Thursday, Mandela met with Namibian President Sam Nujoma
and tried to convince him not to send troops or weapons to Congo.
	   ``The president of Namibia and ourselves agreed on everything at
the end of the discussion,'' Mandela said.
	   Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo, briefing South Africa's parliament
Thursday on his return from Uganda and Rwanda, warned the Congo war
could destabilize much of sub-Saharan Africa.
	   ``What faces us and the rest of Africa is a crisis of deep
proportions,'' Nzo said.
	   In Harare, Zimbabwe, Mugabe denied there was a rift with Mandela
over Congo. But the president of Zimbabwe bluntly offered advice to
countries which aren't on board for his plan for military
intervention.
	   ``Those who want to keep out, fine. Let them keep out,'' Mugabe
told state-controlled media in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital. ``But
let them be silent about those who want to help.''
	   Mugabe refused to comment on exactly what troops and weapons
Zimbabwe plans to send to Congo, or when such a military mission
would occur.

Yeltsin's former adviser: Russia can't reenter world markets soon
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's abrupt change in economic policy will
likely keep it from borrowing on world financial markets for at
least two to three years, President Boris Yeltsin's former economic
adviser predicted Thursday.
	   Alexander Livshits, who resigned earlier this week after Yeltsin
reversed course and effectively devalued the ruble, said Russia's
greatest task now is to regain the confidence of international
markets.
	   Livshits resigned after six years as one of Yeltsin's inner
circle of economic advisers. He was a key player in many of the
policies that put Russia on the road to economic reform, then
apparently carried it to the brink of economic disaster.
	   Livshits regretted he was unable to forecast the events that
forced Yeltsin to make the tough political decision to effectively
devalue the ruble, the national currency, and to restructure the
country's short-term debts.
	   ``Probably all of us ... could have done something so that this
decision wouldn't be necessary, forecast the situation much better
and ... not given in to excessive optimism,'' Livshits said in an
interview with The Associated Press.
	   He particularly regretted Yeltsin's decision to devalue the
ruble by letting its value against the dollar slide as much as 34
percent.
	   ``I had told people we'd do everything possible to keep the
ruble stable, not to let it drop,'' Livshits said. ``I'd said if it
drops, I go.''
	   Livshits sat in his sparely appointed office in one of the
former Communist Party Central Committee buildings that Yeltsin's
administration now occupies.
	   On the wall above his head hung a copy of a Eurobond from a
successful issue Russia offered in March 1997 to raise money on
international markets. He had been finance minister at the time,
and he considered it one of his proudest achievements.
	   ``We need to have an ultimate goal: to be worthy of reentering
the world financial market,'' he said. ``I think we'll be able to
do it. The whole question is when. I think it won't be sooner than
two to three years, or maybe longer.''
	   Livshits said that the timing of Russia's return would depend in
part on what the government decides to do about restructuring its
ruble-denominated debt.
	   The government had planned to announce the terms of the
restructuring plan on Wednesday but postponed its statement until
Monday under pressure from foreign investors who feared Russia was
going to offer them a worse deal than Russian banks.
	   According to the Central Bank, Russian commercial banks owed
non-residents dlrs 19.2 billion as of July 1.
	   Livshits reeled off mistakes the government had made. It missed
several opportunities to reduce its huge government budget deficit.
He and other policymakers had been too willing to negotiate with
the parliament, had struck dangerous compromises and had accepted
unrealistic budgets, he said.
	   The government had also been too slow to react to the changes in
foreign investors' expectations and tactics after the Asian
financial crisis last summer. Today, they want better financial
management by the government and more candor, he said.
	   ``Let's face it: When they came to our market, we collected
taxes badly. We had an unrealistic budget. We had little (legal)
transparency and we rarely spoke the truth. But they nevertheless
invested money and they weren't afraid.
	   ``The Asian crisis undid them.... And the Russian authorities
didn't notice this.''
	   Echoing investors, the International Monetary Fund, which led a
dlrs 22.6 billion bailout earlier this summer, has demanded that
the government do a better job of collecting taxes and cutting its
spending.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Kenyans prayed at a memorial service
Thursday to heal the scars inflicted by ``evil-doers'' who killed
257 people in twin attacks in East Africa, while the FBI chief
toured the wreckage of the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania.
	   An Egyptian Islamic militant planned the bombings, according to
a senior government official in Pakistan who said he saw the
confession of a suspect arrested there.
	   The suspect, named by U.S. and Kenyan officials as Mohammed
Saddiq Odeh, said planning began in July under the direction of a
man he called Ali Saleh, a member of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad
group.
	   The government source, who insisted on anonymity, said Saleh was
an Egyptian and a close associate of Osama Bin Laden, whom U.S.
officials call a major sponsor of terrorism.
	   The main conspirators left before the explosions, leaving behind
Kenyans and Tanzanians hired to carry out the bombings, he said.
	   Kenyan and Tanzanian police could not confirm the reports.
	   Two bombs exploded Aug. 7 at the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and
Dar es Salaam, killing 247 people in Kenya and 10 in Tanzania. More
than 5,500 people were injured, mostly Kenyans.
	   FBI Director Louis Freeh, who later traveled to Nairobi where he
planned a news conference on Friday, met with FBI agents and local
officials in Dar es Salaam.
	   ``We haven't made any conclusions that anybody being held here
is connected at this point to the bombing,'' Freeh said, referring
to the two suspects detained in Tanzania. Their names and
nationalities have not been released.
	   Kenyan police said last week they were holding ``about five
people'' in their investigation.
	   In Nairobi, thousands wearing red ribbons as a sign of mourning
gathered on a grassy hill in downtown Uhuru Park to seek peace and
healing from the attacks.
	   ``It is the day that Satan visited Nairobi,'' President Daniel
arap Moi said during the service.
	   Moi pledged to work closely with U.S. officials to track down
the terrorists. ``The government will not allow Kenyans to be
victims of these inhumane criminals,'' he said.
	   He suggested a memorial be built near the bombing site.
	   The names of the hundreds who died were read in batches of six,
punctuated by murmurs of ``Lord have mercy'' from mourners beneath
a steel-gray sky. A trumpet soloist played ``Amazing Grace.''
	   U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell, no longer wearing bandages
over the cuts she received in the bombing, promised that America
would help East Africans through this difficult time.
	   ``Together we will dispel the shadows of darkness, emerge from
the veils of grief, and create a brighter tomorrow,'' she said.
	   Both Kenya and Tanzania have pressed for compensation for damage
to lives and property. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
promised aid earlier this week, but did not specify an amount.
	   ``Evil-doers left in their wake broken bodies, broken hearts and
broken hopes of too many people who have shown us nothing but
welcome and kindness,'' Bushnell said. ``Evil-doers also left in
their wake anger, misunderstanding and divisiveness. Evil-doers
have tried to conquer us but they will not, they shall not.''
	   U.S. officials are pressing to get their hands on bin Laden, who
lives in Afghanistan, but they have received mixed signals from
Afghanistan's ruling Taliban religious army.
	   The Saudi millionaire living in Afghanistan has called on
Muslims to attack American installations. Saleh led Bin Laden's
terrorist group in Africa, the Pakistani source said.
	   Police officials in Cairo said Saleh's name was not known to
them. They said that no one by that name has been charged in any
militant cases in Egypt.
	   The Kenyan police's Peter Mbuvi, deputy director of the Criminal
Investigation Department, also said he had not heard of Saleh.

U.N. official: humanitarian assistance in Sudan unsustainable
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHEGE MBITIRU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The international community cannot sustain
the current level of humanitarian assistance to southern Sudan, and
the warring parties must be forced to end their 15-year conflict, a
U.N. official said Thursday.
	   ``Actually, it is the most costly conflict anywhere in the world
in terms of human lives and in terms of displacement.'' said Tom
Eric Vraalsen, U.N. Special Envoy for Humanitarian Affairs for
Sudan.
	   An estimated 1.5 million people have died in the fighting
between rebels and government forces and in accompanying famines.
More than 3 million others have been forced to flee their homes.
	   The second round of the civil war began in 1983 when southerners
took up arms to press for increased autonomy and development for
the predominantly black, Christian and animist region traditionally
dominated by the Muslim and Arabized north.
	   Vraalsen, who is on a 10-day visit to Sudan and Kenya, told a
news conference he had talks with Sudanese officials in Khartoum
and, in Kenya, with Col. John Garang, leader of the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army.
	   He said he emphasized the need for a political solution to all.
	   ``The international community cannot indefinitely sustain a
humanitarian effort of this level,'' Vraalsen said. ``The time has
come to exert greater effort to force the parties to take more
responsibility for their people.''
	   David Fletcher, coordinator of Operation Lifeline Sudan, an
umbrella organization including 37 U.N. and non-governmental
agencies working in Sudan, said donors have pledged dlrs 128
million of the dlrs 154 million requested in April.
	   Vraalsen said both the government and rebels have agreed to
consider extending the current three-month cease-fire beyond
September in southwestern Bahr al-Ghazal province, the hardest hit
by famine.
	   Vraalsen said he is seeking a six-month cease-fire throughout
southern Sudan.
	   ``What I would try to work for is to bring them to a table where
they can sit and negotiate a truce like that,'' Vraalsen said.
	   Vraalsen said at least 70 people are dying daily in the
provincial capital, Wau, about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles)
southwest of Khartoum.
	   The United Nations estimates 1.5 million people face starvation
across southern Sudan, half of them in Bhar al-Ghazal.
	   Vraalsen, who is also Norway's permanent representative to the
United Nations, was appointed to the humanitarian post in June by
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.

Spanish families of Omagh victims due full compensation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The families of Spaniards killed or injured
in the Omagh bomb attack will be due full compensation payment,
news reports citing the British Embassy in Madrid said Thursday.
	   Under British regulations, innocent victims of the violence in
Northern Ireland shall receive indemnity payment regardless of
their nationality, the national news agency Efe said, citing an
embassy statement.
	   Two Spaniards, 12-year-old Fernando Blasco Baselga and Rocio
Abad Ramos, a 23 year-old Spanish teacher, were among 28 people
killed in a car bomb blast in the Northern Ireland town of Omagh
last Saturday.
	   Twelve young Spaniards were among the more than 300 people
injured in the attack which was claimed by an Irish nationalist
group opposed to the region's peace process.
	   The Spanish victims were the first foreigners to be killed in
three decades of violence in Northern Ireland.
	   It was not immediately known if any of the families involved
have applied for compensation. No one could be reached for comment
at the embassy Thursday afternoon.
	   Later in the day, representatives of the Spanish royal family
and British and Irish politicians were scheduled to join relatives
of Blasco Baselga and Abad Ramos for a memorial service in Madrid.
	   Funerals for the two were held Tuesday after their bodies were
flown home from Northern Ireland.
	   Princess Elena and her husband, Jaime de Marichalar, were to
represent the royal family while Foreign Minister Abel Matutes,
deputy Irish Prime Minister Mary Harney and John McFall of the
Northern Ireland Office, were also to attend.
	   The Spaniards had traveled to Omagh while on an exchange visit
to Ireland to improve their English.

Netanyahu snubs ceremony marking fifth anniversary of peace accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Israel-Syria &QL; 
 &UR; By DANNA HARMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Saying he is too busy to indulge in
``nostalgia,'' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will skip next
week's ceremony in Oslo marking the fifth anniversary of Israel's
breakthrough peace accord with the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu's spokesman, Aviv Bushinsky, said Thursday that the
prime minister was too busy to fly to Norway. ``The prime minister
prefers to remain in the country in an effort to advance the peace
process... and not deal in ceremonialism and nostalgia,'' Bushinsky
said.
	   In an interview with Israel Channel 2 TV, Bushinsky added that
it must be remembered that Netanyahu, ``did not support the
agreement to begin with.''
	   Netanyahu's decision drew criticism from the dovish opposition
and even his own coalition leader who said the prime minister
should have used the ceremony to try to renew contacts with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   ``It's a terrible mistake,'' former Prime Minister Shimon Peres
said of Netanyahu's snub. ``We owe our thanks to the people of
Norway.''
	   Earlier this week, Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek
called Netanyahu at a hotel in northern Israel where the prime
minister is vacationing and asked him to reconsider.
	   In 1993, Norway hosted the secret contacts between Israel and
the PLO that led to an agreement of mutual recognition and to a
framework agreement on Palestinian autonomy. The agreement was
finalized on Aug. 19-20 and was signed Sept. 13, 1993 in
Washington.
	   Peres, Arafat and U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross will attend
Monday's ceremony in Norway.
	   As opposition leader, Netanyahu staunchly opposed the so-called
Oslo agreements, saying they posed a danger to Israel's existence.
When he became prime minister in 1996, Netanyahu said he would
honor Israel's commitments, but talks with the Palestinians over
Israeli withdrawals in the West Bank have stalled since March 1997.
	   Israel will be represented in Norway by Netanyahu's political
adviser, Uzi Arad, and Meir Shetreet, chairman of the governing
coalition.

Winter could be disastrous for Kosovo refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top European Union official warned
Thursday that if refugees in Kosovo can't return home before
winter, there will be no way to avoid a major humanitarian crisis.
	   Wrapping up her two-day visit to Kosovo, Emma Bonino, the EU
commissioner for humanitarian described the situation in the
southern Serbian province as ``very gloomy.''
	   An estimated 231,000 people have left their homes and taken up
hiding in the woods, where many of them are suffering from
malnutrition, Bonino said.
	   ``If the existing situation continues ... no humanitarian
efforts will be able avert a major humanitarian crisis and
suffering, particularly in view of the coming winter.'' Bonino told
reporters.
	   She said the European Commission has already committed more than
dlrs 7 million in aid to Kosovo, but she appealed to donors to
help, saying more was needed.
	   Serb security forces and pro-independence ethnic Albanian rebels
have been fighting in Kosovo for six months. Serbia is the dominant
republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Free access to the refugees and affected areas has frequently
been a problem, because of fighting or roadblocks. Bonino appealed
to both sides to allow aid workers to deliver their goods and
strongly urged the Yugoslav government ``to deliver on promises for
a ceasefire.''

Tobagan striker moves to Reds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yorke agreeing 5-year deal, adds exact transfer
fee &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Manchester United Thursday hired
Aston Villa striker Dwight Yorke for 12.6 million pounds (dlrs 20.8
million).
	   Manager Alex Ferguson persuaded the Tobagan star to sign a
five-year contract in time for a midnight deadline so that Yorke
can play in the next round of the European Champions Cup.
	   Villa originally wanted 16 million pounds (dlrs 26.4 million)
for its longest serving player, a fee which would have beaten the
British transfer record 15 million (24.75 million) Newcastle paid
Blackburn Rovers for Alan Shearer two years ago.
	   In a long-running transfer wrangle, United originally offered a
little over half that and the two clubs eventually agreed a price
on Thursday.
	   The transfer means that Ferguson has spent 27 million pounds
(dlrs 44.5 million) on three players during the summer.
	   He also hired Dutch defender Jaap Stam for 10 million pounds
(dlrs 16.5 million) and Swedish winger Jesper Blomqvist for 4.5
million (dlrs 7.4 million). He also agreed a 9 million pounds (dlrs
14.8 million) with AC Milan for Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert but
the player turned down the move.
	   Yorke joined Villa in 1990 from the Tobagan club St. Clair's as
a 17-year-old. In the last three seasons, he has scored 46 league
goals for the Birmingham club.
	   During his spell at Villa Park, Yorke played under five
different managers _ Graham Taylor, who went on to become England
coach, Josef Venglos, Ron Atkinson, Brian Little and current
manager John Gregory.
	   ``Once he had stated publicly he wanted to play for Manchester
United and not Aston Villa I had no other option but to agree to
his transfer,'' Gregory said Thursday.
	   ``Personally it was a big letdown that a player didn't want to
play for me.''

	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's electoral commission and
prospective candidates for soon-to-be announced elections are
demanding that the military keep out of the voting process.
	   A Wednesday meeting in the capital, Abuja, was attended by the
commission as well as representatives of more than 50 political
groups seeking to formally register as political parties.
	   For most participants, military non-interference was the most
pressing issue. That comes as no surprise, as Nigeria has been
ruled by the military for all but 10 years since independence from
Great Britain in 1960.
	   Another primary issue was the role of the commission, which the
political aspirants said should be limited to establishing election
regulations and registering _ but not screening _ potential
parties.
	   The electoral commission was sworn in last week by the country's
new military leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, who has promised a
transition to civilian rule by May 31, 1999.
	   The electoral commission is expected to publish final guidelines
and a provisional timetable for elections next week.
	   ------
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ At least 140 people have been
killed in ethnic violence in southern Ethiopia and another 100,000
have been displaced, according to a government spokeswoman.
	   The deaths occurred last month when members of the Hadiya and
Guji ethnic groups clashed in Bale zone of the southern Oromo
region, Selome Tadesse said late Wednesday.
	   Tadese said most of those killed were Hadiyas who had clashed
with the semi-nomaic Gujis over land. The sides reportedly fought
with machetes, swords and guns.
	   Neither the state-run media nor radio and newspapers belonging
to the ruling Ethiopian People's Democratic Revolutionary Front
reported on the clashes.
	   Tadese described as ``very, very exaggerated'' claims by
opposition parties and reports in four independent weekly
newspapers that 3,000 people had been killed and hundreds of
thousands displaced by the ethnic violence.
	   Tadese said the 100,000 displaced had returned to their homes
and peace had been restored through what she described as
``traditional mechanisms'' using elders from the two ethnic groups.
	   ------
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The government has launched a campaign to
vaccinate 2.4 million children against polio, officials said
Thursday.
	   Deputy Health Minister Teresa Cohen said an epidemic of the
infant paralysis virus had been found in the Luanda area.
	   Children up to 5 years old are to be vaccinated. The campaign's
success depends on access to areas still held by the former rebel
movement UNITA, Cohen said.
	   Health officials have predicted that polio will be eradicated in
Africa by the year 2000, one of the few recent success stories in
African health.
	   Most of southern and eastern Africa is polio free, with 75
percent of remaining cases found in Angola, Ethiopia and Congo, all
in the aftermath of their civil wars.
	   ------
	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ An alleged weekend attack on the Togolese
capital by insurgents from Ghana was a ruse by the government to
crack down on opposition leaders, opposition newspapers say.
	   Several Lome neighborhoods were hit by stray shells during the
Sunday attack, which began near the Ghanaian border. It was blamed
on unidentified ``aggressors'' that the interior ministry said had
tried unsuccessfully to enter the country.
	   But opposition newspapers on Wednesday blamed Togolese president
Gen. Gnassingbe Eyadema, saying he staged the attack to divert
attention from his recent contested election victory and to
intimidate opposition leaders.
	   The opposition-backed newspaper Le Regard lashed out at the
government for not producing the men allegedly arrested in the
incident.
	   Another paper, L'Eveil, said that after interviewing witnesses
on both sides of the border it had concluded that only Togolese
military had fired.
	   Eyadema has ruled Togo for 31 years.
	   Protests and riots followed his declaration of victory in June
presidential elections. The results were disputed by the opposition
and outside observers.
	   ------
	   ZOMBA, Malawi (AP) _ Students at Chancellor College, the biggest
campus of the University of Malawi, on Thursday boycotted classes
for the fourth straight day to protest higher fees and falling
living standards.
	   The boycott at the campus 40 miles north of Malawi's commercial
capital, Blantyre, came two weeks after students at Kamuzu College
of Nursing, another branch of the university, marched to protest
threatened fee increases.
	   Chancellor College Vice Principal Francis Moto said
administrators were to meet students to explain the financial
crisis and seek an end to the boycott.

U.S. not planning to build up naval forces in Gulf
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Iraq-UN &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ A senior U.S. Navy official said Thursday
that the United States was not planning to beef up naval forces in
the Gulf despite recent tensions over U.N. weapons inspections in
Iraq.
	   ``We have the forces in the Gulf that we planned to have for the
foreseeable future,'' said John H. Dalton, who is secretary of the
Navy. ``We have forces here that are necessary.''
	   The United States currently has about 18 warships in the region,
including the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln. There are about
15,000 sailors and marines.
	   Earlier this year, the United States increased the number of
ships and jets in the Gulf after Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein
refused to allow U.N. inspectors into presidential compounds.
	   That impasse was resolved with an agreement brokered Feb. 23 by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   Since Aug. 5, Saddam has refused all cooperation with U.N.
inspectors, accusing them of being puppets of the Americans and
working to prolong punishing trade sanctions.
	   The U.N. Security Council has said the sanctions will not be
lifted until the inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction.
	   Asked about Iraq's stance toward the United Nations, Dalton
said: ``It is very important that Iraq complies with all U.N.
resolutions ... and we will work with the United Nations to resolve
those issues.''
	   Dalton arrived Wednesday in Bahrain from Oman.
	   On Thursday he visited the Bahrain headquarters of the U.S.
Navy's 5th Fleet. He also went to the USS Abraham Lincoln and a
frigate, the USS Jarrett.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with proposal for anti-doping agency, other new
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The International Olympic Committee
on Thursday proposed setting up an anti-doping agency to coordinate
the worldwide fight against performance-enhancing drugs.
	   The IOC executive board called for the creation of an ``Olympic
movement anti-doping agency'' that would be responsible for random,
out-of-competition drug testing around the world.
	   The proposal was the highlight of a series of measures announced
at the end of a special one-day emergency meeting convened in the
wake of a summer of drug scandals in sport.
	   At present, the IOC is directly responsible for drug testing
only during the Olympic Games themselves, with international sports
federations supervising the doping controls the rest of the time.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said the proposed agency
would be funded by Olympic television revenues and would assist
those international federations which can't afford regular
drug-testing programs.
	   The agency would also help set up testing labs in Africa and
Central and South America and create a ``flying lab'' that would
travel to major events around the world, such as the Pan Am Games,
African Games and Central American Games, to conduct testing.

Air traffic controllers at Yakutsk airport go on strike

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Air traffic controllers went on strike Thursday in
the northern Siberian city of Yakutsk to demand wages that have not
been paid in four months, a news agency reported.
	   Air traffic to and from the city was halted, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Overdue wages is a problem throughout Russia and has led to
protests in many parts of the country. They have been mostly
uncoordinated and have had little effect.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Annarita Sidoti regained her European
Championship title and led a 1-2 Italian finish in the women's
10-kilometer walk Thursday.
	   Sidoti, who is also the reigning world champion, led virtually
from start to finish to capture Italy's first gold medal, covering
the distance in 42 minutes, 49 seconds.
	   The Italian had won the European title in 1990 but had to settle
for silver four years later.
	   Erica Alfridi, another Italian, snatched the silver with a time
of 42.54. Susana Feitor of Portugal was just behind in 42.55 to
take the bronze.
	   In the men's 400 meters, the three British sprinters who are
tops in Europe this year all advanced to Friday's final: Mark
Richardson, Iwan Thomas and Solomon Wariso.
	   Thomas led the eight qualifiers with a time of 44.82.
	   In the 3,000-meter steeplechase semifinal, Italy's Luciano Di
Pardo clocked the top time of 8:26.52 followed by Marc Ostendarp of
Germany and Jim Svenoy of Norway, both in 8:26.92.
	   In the women's high jump qualifying, seven jumpers led the way
at 1.93 _ Russians Yelena Gulyayeva, Viktoriya Styopina, Viktoriya
Fyodorova, and Yulia Lyakhova, Poland's Donata Jancewicz, Austrian
Sigrid Kirchmann and Monica Dinescu of Romania.
	   After her victory in the women's 100 on Wednesday, Christine
Arron is expected to challenge American star Marion Jones'
sprinting supremacy.
	   The 24-year-old Guadeloupe native with orange-dyed hair overcame
a slow start to win the women's 100 meters Wednesday at the
European Championship, setting a new continental record of 10.73
seconds.
	   That was just outside the 10.71 and 10.72 clocked by Jones, who
has run each time twice this year.
	   Both still have a lot to go before they can approach the world
record of 10.49 set by Florence Griffith-Joyner in 1988.
	   ``Now I hope to improve more and stay healthy and do something
really nice next year at the worlds,'' Arron said.
	   If Arron is closing in on Jones, the European men are still way
behind the North Americans.
	   Darren Campbell led a 1-2 British finish in the men's 100,
clocking 10.04 seconds to set a championship record and a personal
best.
	   Campbell is coached by Linford Christie, the retired ace who had
won the last three European titles and the last European to
successfully battle the North Americans.
	   But Campbell was quick to issue a challenge.
	   ``I am No. 1 in Europe now. This is one of the stepping stones
that Linford and I have planned so that we can take on the
Americans seriously,'' the 24-year-old Briton said.
	   Arron trailed Irina Privalova of Russia, who had a flying start.
But with her powerful stride, Arron caught up with Privalova in the
last 20 meters and stole the title and the European record from the
Russian, who is coming off leg surgery.
	   ``Halfway through the race I saw Privalova from the corner of my
eye and I accelerated between 60 and 80 meters,'' Arron said.
	   Privalova clocked 10.83 to win the silver in her fastest race
this year. Her 1994 record was 10.77.
	   Ekaterini Thanou of Greece won the bronze in 10.87 despite a
slow start and set a national record.
	   Arron's performance overshadowed the British triumph in the
men's dash.
	   Campbell, who once nearly quit track to take up soccer, edged
another upcoming British sprinter, Dwain Chambers, who took the
silver in 10.10. Charalambos Papadias of Greece won the bronze in
10.17.
	   ``Linford has prepared me brilliantly for this,'' Campbell said.
``I knew I was going to win it. I wasn't surprised I won and I
wasn't nervous out there, in fact I felt really cool. I knew after
I was in contention at 60 meters the race would be mine.
	   ``My start was a little bit dodgy but I knew I would be strong
at the end.
	   ``I was really pleased Dwain was second. We said in the call-up
room it would be a one-two, but we didn't know who would win,''
Campbell said.
	   Other gold medals Wednesday went to: Kiril Sosunov of Russia,
who cleared 8.28 meters to win men's long jump; Sonia O'Sullivan of
Ireland, in the women's 10,000 meters with a time of 31:29.33;
Tibor Gescek of Hungary in the men's hammer throw with a heave of
82.87; and Tanja Damaske of Germany in the women's javelin at
69.10.

Study: one-third of Swiss still smoke
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ One-third of Swiss between 15 and 74
smoke, and the proportion is staying stable in contrast to a
decline in other European countries, according to a Swiss
government report released Thursday.
	   The study of the social costs of smoking was carried out by the
University of Neuchatel for the country's health ministry. The
direct annual cost of smoking to the country's medical services is
1.2 billion Swiss francs (dlrs 800 million), it said.
	   The ministry says 10,000 deaths a year _ one in every six _ are
from smoking-related diseases.
	   Switzerland has a population of some 7 million. The researchers
gave a figure of 1.75 million for the number of smokers in the
15-74 age group, or 35 percent.
	   The proportion climbed to 40 percent among those aged 20-24,
they said.
	   Swiss Health Ministry director Thomas Zeltner told a news
conference higher cigarette prices and tighter curbs on
Switzerland's widespread tobacco advertising are needed to address
the nation's smoking habit.
	   Zeltner lamented a lack of political will to combat smoking. He
said an effective prevention campaign would cost at least 20
million francs (dlrs 13.4 million) annually, around four times the
current level of spending.
	   Switzerland's tobacco industry association said the study was
politically motivated and ignored the industry's economic
importance.

Russia offers to help Angola develop armed forces
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has offered to help develop Angola's armed
forces in return for diamond and oil deals, a news agency reported
Thursday.
	   The agreement was reached during a visit by Russia's defense
minister to the southern African country last week, said Col. Gen.
Leonid Ivashov, head of the Defense Ministry's main department for
international cooperation.
	   Ivashov said 70-80 percent of Angola's mostly Soviet-produced
military equipment needs to be repaired or replaced, Interfax
reported.
	   Russia is prepared to help in exchange for a larger share in the
development of Angola's diamond fields and diamond sales, Ivashov
said. Russian firms would also be interested in selling Angolan oil
he said.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev spent three days in
Angola discussing the proposals.

Actor fails to block magazine with details from banned bio
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Actor Alain Delon on Thursday failed to persuade a
court to order off the newsstands a French magazine that published
sordid allegations from an planned unauthorized biography.
	   The tabloid-style newsweekly Marianne apparently thought it
could get around an earlier court decision that blocked anyone from
even publishing the book's synopsis, by running court papers that
cite its contents.
	   Among the details in the Aug. 17 issue, quoted from the court
papers, were Delon's alleged youthful dalliances with other actors
or actresses and reported ties to shady politicians, mafia figures
and mercenaries.
	   Now 63, Delon was for decades a dashing screen idol in dozens of
movies including ``The Leopard'' and ``Rocco and his Brothers.''
	   Delon attacked the synopsis as defamatory and the court agreed
Aug. 5 to block author Bernard Violet from writing the book, at
least until another hearing set for Oct. 14.
	   Delon lawyer Jean Braghini argued that Marianne ``revealed to
its readers precisely what a court forbade to publish.
	   ``The procedure used by Marianne is shameful and filthy,'' he
said.
	   The court rejected Delon's bid to halt sales of the Marianne
issue.
	   But it ordered the magazine to publish a statement in its next
issue saying ``the judge finds that the freedom of information must
not go to the point of publishing even legal documents revealing
elements that put privacy in question,'' said the weekly's editor,
Bernard Morot.
	   Violet, a former reporter for French television, has written 10
other investigative books. Among them: biographies of the terrorist
Carlos, convicted Vichy official Maurice Papon, oceanographer
Jacques Cousteau, and a look at France's secret services under the
late President Francois Mitterrand.

Lippi and Del Piero questioned in doping-investigation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With ROM110-111 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Juventus coach Marcello Lippi and star-forward
Alessandro Del Piero were questioned Thursday by the anti-doping
commission of the Italian Olympic Committee looking into
allegations top players in Italy's first division soccer league
took performance-enhancing substances.
	   For Del Piero it was the second such testimony. In a meeting
with a Turin prosecutor last week, he said his muscles are the
result of ``years of hard work.''
	   The investigation stems from an interview by AS Roma coach
Zdenek Zeman, who said he was amazed by the quick muscular
development of players including Gianluca Vialli and Del Piero.
	   Several players, team doctors and coaches have since been
questioned since Zeman's remarks.
	   Earlier Thursday, Brazilian soccer star Ronaldo, back in Milan
to join Inter after a month-long vacation, said he is willing to
volunteer information to prosecutors.
	   ``If they want to know anything from me, I'll be glad to go''
see them, the AGI news agency quoted Ronaldo as saying.
	   ``Where I've played I've never heard anything like this,'' he
added. ``I don't know about other teams, though.''
	   Ronaldo has not been summoned, but there were speculations over
the last days that he could be questioned.
	   Testimony will continue in the next days with Italy's national
team captain Paolo Maldini, and Chelsea's Roberto Di Matteo and
Pierluigi Casiraghi, among others.

LAUSANNE: conduct testing.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Samaranch said the agency would be under the aegis of all
Olympic bodies, not just the IOC, and would have an independent
status. He said it would be headquartered in Lausanne and headed by
an IOC official.
	   Other details, including how much the agency would cost and how
many tests it would carry out, will be worked out later.
	   The proposed agency will be put forward for approval at a
special worldwide doping summit in Lausanne next Feb. 2-3,
Samaranch said.
	   ``This agency will make us stronger than before,'' IOC medical
commission chairman Prince Alexandre de Merode said. ``To be united
is a key success of the anti-doping fight. We all have to be
unified in this battle.''
	   But de Merode stressed that the Olympic movement will never
succeed in wiping out doping completely.
	   ``We will never win,'' he said. ``We will never eliminate
doping. But we will not lose.''
	   The IOC also appointed its four vice presidents to lead task
forces on four general topics for the February summit:
	   _ the protection of athletes
	   _ political and legal issues, including the definition of doping
and cooperation with governments
	   _ ethics, prevention and education
	   _ financial questions, including the commercial pressures which
can lead to drug use and the issue of financing the anti-doping
fight
	   Anita DeFrantz of the United States will lead the task force on
protection of athletes, Keba Mbaye of Senegal on the political and
legal questions, Pal Schmitt of Hungary on ethics, and Dick Pound
of Canada on the financial matters.

23 Kenyans die after drinking illicit alcoholic brew
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIVASHA, Kenya (AP) _ An illegal alcoholic brew popularly
consumed because it is cheap killed 23 people and blinded three, a
senior government official said Thursday.
	   The deaths and injuries occurred in various parts of Nakuru
district and neighboring Narok, northwest of Nairobi, between
Monday and Wednesday, said Nakuru District Commissioner John
Litunda. He said one seller of the brew was arrested.
	   Litunda said 20 people who had consumed the drink were treated
and discharged from various hospitals and clinics. Four people,
three of them blind, were admitted at Kijabe Mission Hospital,
about 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of the capital.
	   Hospital Matron Anne Ndung'u said the patients complained of
stomach pains, drowsiness and blurred eyesight.
	   Litunda said the victims drank what is locally known as ``power
alcohol,'' made from ingredients including an unidentified
industrial chemical. Samples of the concoction were taken to
Nairobi for analysis, he said.
	   The drink is popular because it is inexpensive. Litunda said a
glass of the drink costs 10 shillings (about 6 U.S. cents). A
bottle of ordinary beer costs about 52 shillings (86 U.S. cents).
	   Last September, 24 people died and six others lost their
eyesight after drinking a similar concoction in Murang'a, another
central Kenya district.

Arab League, Syria criticize Israeli decision on Golan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Israel-Syria &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Arab League on Thursday accused Israel
of attempting to ``torpedo the peace process'' by approving the
construction of thousands of new homes for Jews in the occupied
Golan Heights.
	   The statement came a day after a ministerial committee headed by
Israel's infrastructure minister, Ariel Sharon, approved the
construction of 2,300 homes and 2,500 vacation units in four Golan
settlements.
	   The 22-member Arab League said in a statement that the decision
``reflects the hostile intention of the Israeli government aiming
to torpedo the peace process, and its intention to maintain its
occupation of the Syrian Golan.''
	   It called on Israel ``to immediately stop all its expansionist
and racist practices that take the region to the whirlpool of
tension and violence.''
	   Israel captured the Golan from Syria in the 1967 Middle East War
and later annexed it.
	   Syria has demanded the return of the Golan in exchange for peace
with Israel. The government of the late Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin was ready to give back the plateau. But Rabin's hard-line
successor, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said he is not bound by Rabin's
promises and that the Golan is critical to Israel's security.
	   Talks between the two sides haven't been held since the spring
of 1996.
	   State-run Syrian Radio on Thursday said in a commentary that
peace could not coexist with ``occupation and building
settlements.''
	   The radio added that no action by the Israelis in the Golan
would change the reality that ``the Golan is Syrian and that all
occupied territories should return to their owners.''

Foreign exchange controls relaxed to boost foreign trade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Ethiopia has relaxed its foreign
exchange controls to boost foreign trade, according to Finance
Minister Sufian Ahmed.
	   Ahmed told the government Ethiopian News Agency Wednesday that
the government-owned Commercial Bank of Ethiopia and four small
banks will start handling foreign exchanges dealings.
	   In the past, all foreign exchanges dealings were controlled by
the Central Bank of Ethiopia.
	   Exporters complained that central bank procedures were complex
and stringent.
	   Sufian also said the amount of hard currency available at the
weekly auction will be increased from the current average of dlrs
20 million. He did not give the amount for the increase.
	   The minister said an institution will be soon be set up to
promote Ethiopian exports, which are overshadowed by its imports.
	   Imports climbed to dlrs 1.2 billion in 1997-98, compared to dlrs
630 million in exports mainly from coffee, hides and skin, Sufian
said.
	   Sources told The Associated Press that the the government's
previous failure to liberalize foreign exchange controls was one of
the stumbling blocks in negotiations between the government and the
International Monetary Fund.

Local elections scheduled for Sept. 10
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaica's local government elections,
now years overdue, are to take place Sept. 10, Prime Minister P.J.
Patterson announced Wednesday night.
	   Local government elections are due every three years but were
last held in March 1990, the year after the ruling People's
National Party defeated the Jamaica Labor Party in parliamentary
elections in 1989. New elections had been postponed six times.
	   Some 227 parish councillors will be elected and from their
numbers 13 mayors will be chosen.
	   The Jamaica Labour Party, which had been embroiled in an
internal division over whether to contest the elections, decided
Wednesday to field candidates.
	   The decision was announced after a meeting between Patterson and
Edward Seaga, leader of the Labor party.
	   Seaga later described his agreement with Patterson as
representing a ``great breakthrough.''
	   In his broadcast, Patterson said Local Government ``will be
deeply entrenched in any new constitution which is adopted for
Jamaica, because never again must it be on the deathbed because of
neglect, however malignant may be the intentions of the
administration in power.''

 &UR; Czechs, Russians mark anniversary of Soviet invasion &QL; 
 &UR; By JAN SLIVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czechs and Russians marked the
30th anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia with
statements of admiration for those who resisted dictatorship and
calls for reconciliation among those who suffered under Communism.
	   Five armies of the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact rolled into
Czechoslovakia before dawn on Aug. 21, 1968 to crush the reform
program of Communist leader Alexander Dubcek known as the ``Prague
Spring.''
	   The Soviets kidnapped the country's leaders and brought an end
to nine months of free speech and assembly unprecedented in the
Soviet bloc. About 100 people were killed in the invasion, and
hundreds of thousands fled in fear of political revenge.
	   In a speech Thursday on the eve of the anniversary, ailing Czech
President Vaclav Havel said the invasion ``revealed what Communism
really means. It revealed its totalitarian character.''
	   ``For me, the short period (of the Prague Spring) was a time
when one could breathe and speak again after 20 years,'' Havel said
in a speech broadcast by Czech Radio. ``Nobody who lived in that
era can ever forget it.''
	   In Moscow, Russian President Boris Yeltsin described the
Czechoslovak experiment, which Dubcek called ``socialism with a
human face,'' as an attempt ``to escape from ideological dogmatism
and lies.''
	   Yeltsin, in a telegram to the Congress of Russia Intellectuals,
said that ``even shy attempts of reform called down terror from
those who wanted to preserve the totalitarian system.''
	   The leader of Russia's Orthodox Church, Patriarch Alexei II,
used the anniversary of the crackdown to call for reconciliation
among peoples of the former Soviet bloc.
	   Alexei said the Soviet invasion brought ``much sorrow'' to the
Czech people. ``Similar feelings are caused by memories of
bloodshed in Berlin in 1953, in Budapest in 1956 and in Afghanistan
in the 1980s,'' he said, referring to other Soviet moves to enforce
hardline Marxism.
	   In late 1967, Dubcek allowed free speech and freedom of
assembly, arguing that the ideals of Communism and freedom could
exist together. Fearing such views could topple their empire, the
Soviet Union and all its Warsaw Pact allies except Romania rolled
across the border, deposed Dubcek and replaced him with hardliner
Gustav Husak.
	   Communism collapsed in Czechoslovakia in 1989 and in January
1993, the country peacefully split into the independent countries
of Czech Republic and Slovakia.
	   Dubcek was expelled from the Czechoslovak Communist Party in
1970 and lived in virtual seclusion at his home in the Slovak
capital, Bratislava. After losing the presidency to Havel in 1989,
he became the largely symbolic president of Parliament and died in
1992.

Islamic party &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's Finance Ministry has asked
prosecutors to investigate the finances of a banned Islamic party,
saying Thursday that the party falsified records and hid cash
reserves, the semiofficial Anatolia news agency said.
	   Finance Ministry inspectors said dlrs 3.6 million was missing in
the accounts of the Welfare Party.
	   The Constitutional Court shut down the Welfare Party in February
on the grounds the party had sought to undermine Turkey's secular
system. The party's funds and assets were ordered seized; the
inspectors were checking its books to see what would be
confiscated.
	   The discrepancy prompted the Finance Ministry to ask prosecutors
to investigate, the news agency said.
	   Inspectors claim that the party headquarters made false entries
into its books, showing the money as being transferred to local
party branches around the country.
	   Riza Ulucak, who led the party's financial department, denied
the allegation.
	   ``The money has been transferred to the local branches and
receipts have been collected,'' Ulucak said.
	   Ulucack is a deputy of Welfare's successor, the Virtue Party. He
could face trial if investigators believe him guilty of fraud.
	   The dlrs 3.6 million consisted of state subsidies, donations and
interest. Each political party gets state subsidies according to
its share of votes.
	   The Islamic party was in power until June 1997, when the
military, the guardian of the country's secular traditions,
pressured it into resigning. Since then, a pro-secular government
has been dutifully waging a campaign against radical Islam.

Holocaust settlements boost pressure on German industry
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German banks, insurers and industry have
usually ducked compensation for Holocaust victims, but settlements
by Swiss banks and an Italian insurance company have put pressure
on German firms to be more forthcoming.
	   At issue for industry are former slave laborers who worked in
Germany during the Nazi regime and have gotten the run-around from
companies and the government when asking for back wages.
	   Fearing lawsuits of the kind that dogged Swiss banks, big German
firms that have refused to compensate former slave workers are
casting about for ways to head off an onslaught.
	   One suggestion, raised in a newspaper report Thursday, is a
government-sponsored fund that industry would pay into.
	   Automaker BMW, electronics giant Siemens and the Hochtief
construction firm have signaled readiness to pay into such a fund,
the Frankfurter Rundschau said.
	   Spokespeople for BMW and Hochtief confirmed Thursday that they
would consider such payments, though a BMW spokesman denied his
company was acting under pressure. Siemens had no comment.
	   Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial group, also pledged
to take part.
	   More than 7 million people were forced to work in Nazi Germany,
and experts believe at least 500,000 are still alive.
	   Jewish groups and lawyers for the victims have long campaigned
for Germany to come clean on slave labor.
	   But what really put Germany on the spot was last week's
agreement by two Swiss banks to cut through a similar legal battle
and pay dlrs 1.25 billion in an out-of-court settlement of
Holocaust claims against them.
	   Even before, Volkswagen made a surprise announcement last month
that it would pay its World War II slave laborers.
	   The German government has paid billions to Holocaust survivors
for imprisonment and health damage, but has refused to honor wage
claims, saying laborers worked for private companies.
	   Most of the companies involved, however, argue that the Nazi
regime was responsible for wartime slave labor, and that claims
should be directed to the regime's successor _ the current German
government.
	   Some companies have made donations to help former slave workers.
Daimler has given about dlrs 15 million over the last decade and
kept up a dialogue with former slave laborers.
	   Michel Friedman, board member of the Central Council of Jews in
Germany, said he could support an industry-financed fund.
	   ``I believe the German companies feel under pressure, but that
responsible managers understand there is no alternative to the
truth,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``The time to act is
now.''
	   Allianz, Germany's biggest insurer, is also under pressure to
act after Wednesday's dlrs 100 million settlement between Italian
insurance company Assicurazioni Generali and Jewish organizations.
	   Allianz is among European insurers negotiating a settlement of
claims for policies sold to Jews who later died in the Holocaust.
	   Overall, those claims could pass the dlrs 1 billion mark, a
leading U.S. insurance official said Thursday.
	   Deborah Senn, insurance commissioner for Washington state, told
a news conference in Jerusalem that the Generali settlement was
only a beginning and did not define the Italian company's total
debt to the survivors and heirs.
	   Senn is on a nine-member task force negotiating with European
insurance companies on the settlement of the claims.
	   Even German banks, long reticent about their dealings under the
Nazis, have started opening up their past.
	   Last month, historians tracing the origin of gold bars Deutsche
Bank traded during the Nazi era said the bank profited from gold
plundered from Holocaust victims, and that it is ``likely'' top
bank officials knew the origins.
	   Deutsche and Dresdner banks, Germany's two largest, face an dlrs
18 billion lawsuit filed in New York in June charging they
knowingly accepted, laundered or sold property of Nazi victims
during World War II.

	   HARBIN, China (AP) _ Rivers swollen from weeks of rain rushed
over parts of China's largest oil field Thursday and smothered
farming villages outside a key industrial center.
	   Tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians rushed sandbags to
plug leaky dikes _ already piled two meters (six feet) high with
the dirt-filled sacks _ to keep the Songhua River from flooding
Harbin, capital of northeast Heilongjiang province.
	   On the north bank, opposite the city, the river swallowed dikes
and covered fields, leaving only village roofs poking through the
waters. Families took shelter in trains parked on sidings atop
raised rail beds. One couple, their two children and four cows
camped on a garbage heap between the rail beds.
	   ``The lives of a family of four have been saved. All the rest
has been tossed away,'' said farmer Sun Shifa, crouching by a
smoldering fire on the garbage strewn mound.
	   Surging waters in the northeast have compounded the misery of
China's worst flood season in at least 40 years. Much of the
Yangtze River in central China has stood above the emergency stage
for three weeks or longer, weakening levees.
	   The Yangtze's sixth flood crest in two months came down on
Wuhan, a major industrial hub with 7 million people. More than
280,000 soldiers, police and city residents braved thunderstorms
Thursday night to patrol shaky embankments, the official Xinhua
News Agency reported.
	   Flooding has killed more than 2,000 people nationwide, left
millions homeless and caused 200 billion yuan (dlrs 24 billion) in
damage. Those tallies were expected to grow.
	   In the northeast, around the Daqing oil field, the Nen River
overwhelmed dikes this week, forcing more than 100,000 people
living up to 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Xingzhan town to
flee, the official China Daily said. A railway line needed to bring
in relief supplies was destroyed Wednesday.
	   More than 1,200 wells at Daqing _ which produces more than a
third of China's oil _ were submerged, and 527 others stopped
pumping altogether, the People's Daily said.
	   Soldiers lugged more sandbags on to a third embankment, the last
defense protecting the oil fields and Daqing city's 2.3 million
people, China Central Television reported.
	   Vice Premier Wen Jiabao, under orders from Communist Party
leader Jiang Zemin, used a bullhorn to exhort the soldiers,
reminding them of what is at stake.
	   ``At our backs are the crucial cities of the north _ Harbin,
Qiqihar _ and our country's greatest oil field, Daqing,'' Wen told
the soldiers during a visit Wednesday.
	   In Harbin, the provincial capital 150 kilometers (100 miles) to
the southeast, Wen told officials and soldiers that the area was
facing its worst flooding in a century, CCTV reported.
	   Waters seeped through the city's 26 kilometers (15 miles) of
dikes and flooded roads and parks next to the Songhua.
	   Soldiers shoveled dirt into sandbags to stop the leaks. Trucks
with loudspeakers played folk songs and encouraging slogans to
boost morale and break the monotony of the work.
	   As the weather turned colder, the Ministry of Civil Affairs made
an urgent appeal for warm clothing, tents and blankets for flood
victims in the northeast.
	   Chinese leaders also began addressing the flooding's long-term
consequences. The Health Ministry renewed orders to local
governments to prevent outbreaks of diseases as health workers,
including medical students, fanned out in the flood areas.
	   The Forestry Department warned that anyone found cutting trees
on the Yangtze's upper reaches would be held accountable.
Clear-cutting hillsides to make way for buildings and farmland has
increased run-off and silting in the Yangtze, worsening seasonal
flooding.

	   The council, after holding its regular, 60-day review of
sanctions, repeated its statement that Iraq's Aug. 5 decision to
freeze cooperation was ``totally unacceptable.''
	   ``They view with extreme concern the continued refusal by the
government of Iraq to rescind the decision,'' council president
Danilo Turk of Slovenia said in a statement.
	   The United States had sought to make the statement tougher, by
recalling resolutions that warned Iraq of ``severest consequences''
if it obstructed inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission or the
International Atomic Energy Agency from carrying out their work.
The effort, however, was blocked, council sources said, speaking on

Trying to restore confidence, Russia says it will guarantee bank

 &UR; With BC-Russia-Regaining Confidence &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government tried to restore some
confidence in the country's shaky banking system Thursday by saying
it would fully guarantee all deposits.
	   The Central Bank proposed a system of federally backed
guarantees to discourage a run on the assets of commercial banks.
Many banks are expected to fail in the wake of the government's
decision this week to let the value of the national currency, the
ruble, fahdrawing them.''
	   A top Central Bank official said only two of the nation's 20
largest banks were on the verge of collapse _ hardly an
overwhelming statement of confidence, but better than some people
had believed.
	   ``I would like to emphasize that the largest Russian banks ...
are in a more or less strong position,'' First Deputy Chairman
Sergei Alexashenko said in an interview. ``They are not in
significant danger.''
	   The ruble's value remained virtually unchanged on the Moscow
currency exchange, which is controlled by the Central Bank and sets
the official exchange rate. It was pegged at 6.995 to the U.S.
dollar.
	   Stocks declined 4 percent in extremely light trading.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said the effective devaluation
of the ruble and suspension of debt payments was a last-ditch
effort to avoid a full default.
	   ``If we were to continue servicing our debt and making payments
on treasury bills we would be unable to pay wages and pensions,''
Kiriyenko said in remarks broadcast by Russian television.
	   Kiriyenko held a meeting with foreign investors and top Russian
financial officials later Thursday. He said they were working on a
compromise debt payment schedule.
	   ``We're not going to refuse to return this money to them, but
act together to calmly and thoroughly analyze the real
opportunities we have,'' the prime minister told the Cabinet.
	   Russia's financial crisis deepened this month as stocks fell
sharply and investors fled Russian bonds en masse, even though
interest rates soared to 200 percent.
	   The Central Bank acknowledged Thursday that Russia's hard
currency reserves fell sharply in the days before the devaluation
was announced, shedding nearly dlrs 2 billion last week alone. They
stood at 15.1 billion last Friday, down from dlrs 17 billion on
Aug. 7.
	   It also described the extent of Russia's capital flight, saying
that between dlrs 3.5 billion and dlrs 4.5 billion were taken out
of the country legally between May and mid-August, the Interfax
news agency said.
	   To keep money in Russian banks, Central Bank Chairman Sergei
Dubinin said the government would ask commercial banks to sign
cooperation agreements with the national Sberbank and enter a pool
in which banks guarantee private deposits.
	   ``If a bank signs (such) an agreement with Sberbank, its
depositors can at any moment transfer their deposits to Sberbank,
thus falling under the state guarantee,'' Dubinin said.

Estonia marks independence declaration with national holiday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TALLINN, Estonia (AP) _ Crowds gathered around the Estonian
capital's Toompea Castle Thursday for the first celebration of a
new national holiday marking the day Estonia decalred independence
from the Soviet Union.
	   ``Seven years ago, it seemed to many that only a miracle could
ever restore independence. The miracle has indeed taken place,''
said Deputy Parliament Speaker Tunne Kelam, a key figure in the
independence drive, in remarks prepared for the celebration.
	   During the chaos of the attempted hard-line coup against Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Estonia's legislature passed a
declaration of independence on Aug. 20, 1991.
	   It was a daring move and many feared it could prompt a Kremlin
crackdown on the Baltic republic. But the coup failed and Gorbachev
returned to preside over the Soviet Union's collapse.
	   The Estonian declaration of independence, and those of its
Baltic neighbors Latvia and Lithuania, were quickly recognized by
many other countries and the Kremlin accepted their independence
three weeks later.
	   Estonian lawmakers this year declared Aug. 20 a national
holiday, over the objections of many who wanted Feb. 24 as the only
independence holiday. That is the day Estonia first declared
independence, in 1918.
	   The country was independent from 1920 to 1940, then annexed by
the Soviet Union, occupied by Nazi Germany and retaken by the
Soviets.

	   Samaranch also clarified the controversial remarks he made in a
Spanish newspaper interview, in which he called for a drastic
reduction in the list of banned substances and suggested that only
drugs which are harmful to an athlete's health should be
prohibited.
	   ``I never said performance-enhancing drugs must be withdrawn
from the list,'' Samaranch told a news conference. ``I would like
to ask the medical commission to review the list like they are
doing from time to time. Maybe we need to put the list up to date.
	   ``As for performance-enhancing drugs, there is not a single one
that is not harming the health of the athletes. We will not
withdraw one single performance-enhancing drug which we have on the
list.
	   ``Doping is something we can not permit. First, we have an
obligation to protect the health of the athletes, and second, it's
a kind of cheating we can not accept in sport.''
	   Samaranch said the next big challenge is to get all Olympic
sports federations to approve the IOC's proposed medical code,
which would unify testing, procedures and sanctions.
	   ``Even if the agency works in the right way, we must have the
approval of a single medical code for all the international
federations,'' he said. ``It's not possible that a drug is
permitted in one federation and not in another.''
	   Samaranch said the IOC would push for further involvement by
governments and national law enforcement agencies in cracking down
on drug producers and traffickers. The world's major drug
manufacturers will be invited to the February summit.
	   Earlier, the IOC board heard a report from Tour de France
organizer Jean-Claude Killy on the doping scandals which tarnished
this summer's race.
	   Killy, a French IOC member and winner of three gold medals in
alpine skiing at the 1968 Grenoble Olympics, is president of the
company which runs the Tour de France.
	   This summer's race was thrown into turmoil by a series of
arrests and police raids which uncovered systematic use of the
banned endurance-boosting hormone EPO.
	   ``It was bad for sports in general and means we should make
decisions now and take steps that aim to correct the problem of
doping,'' Killy said.
	   Describing the Tour's drug crisis as the catalyst for a new
worldwide anti-doping effort, Killy made a 30-minute presentation
to the closed-door meeting.
	   ``It was important (IOC officials) hear about the Tour de
France,'' he said. ``All of it started during the Tour de France.
They called someone who lived through it for three weeks.''
	   Killy said he made specific propopals to the board for fighting
drug use. Without giving details, he described them as ``very
concrete, very positive, very realistic.''

Five years later, Peres hails historic Israeli-Palestinian accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Israel-Peace Ceremony, Israel-Syria &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Despite the dismal state of
Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking, former Prime Minister Shimon Peres
believes the process he began will survive and that Palestinian
statehood will eventually become a reality.
	   Ahead of a trip to Oslo, Norway, to mark the fifth anniversary
of the historic accord, the Nobel laureate told The Associated
Press on Thursday that the deal was ``one of the greatest
achievements of my life.''
	   Peres was foreign minister in 1993 and led the Israeli team of
negotiators in secret talks with the PLO, which led to an agreement
of mutual recognition and to a framework agreement on Palestinian
autonomy. The agreement was signed Sept. 13, 1993 in Washington.
	   Over the next 2 1/2 years, two more accords were signed and
Israel withdrew its forces from two-thirds of the Gaza Strip and
one-third of the West Bank.
	   But the process was painful and violent for both sides. A Jewish
settler shot and killed 29 Muslim worshipers and Palestinian
militants carried out deadly attacks that killed over 100 Israelis.
	   Four suicide bombings in the spring of 1996 helped bring about
the election of Benjamin Netanyahu of the hard-line Likud Party who
faulted the Oslo accord for creating bloodshed instead of peace.
	   Netanyahu won on a promise to slow down the process and keep
more occupied land under Israeli control. Within months of his
election, the negotiations came to a stand-still in March 1997.
	   With the sides hardly speaking less than a year before the
negotiations are to be completed, critics say the Oslo agreements
have failed.
	   But Peres looked on the positive side.
	   ``Before Oslo, we had a Palestinian problem, but no partner.
Here ... a Palestinian partner was established,'' Peres said in
interview in his Tel Aviv office crammed with memorabilia from half
a century of public service, including a framed photograph of him,
the late Yitzhak Rabin, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S.
President Bill Clinton signing a peace agreement in Washington.
	   Peres said he believed the current setbacks in the process are
temporary. ``If the government doesn't move ahead, it will fall _
not the peace process,'' he said.
	   Peres said Israelis were indebted to Norway for hosting the
talks. Hours before his flight to Oslo on Thursday, Peres was
clearly excited about the milestone.
	   Peres, Arafat and U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross will all attend
Sunday's event. But Netanyahu has said he was too busy to attend.
	   Peres called Netanyahu's snub ``a terrible mistake'' and said
the ceremony offered an opportunity to advance peace.
	   The peace agreements brought Nobel Peace prizes for Peres,
Arafat and Rabin, killed by a Jewish extremist in November 1995 for
handing over land some believe was promised to the Jews by God.
	   But Peres said Israel has both a moral obligation and an
interest in assisting in the creation of a Palestinian state on
that land. ``The alternative ... is an ongoing clash between two
peoples,'' he said.

	   The council review came after Iraq rejected a request for
resumed cooperation from the chief weapons inspector, Richard
Butler. Butler sent a letter Wednesday to Iraq's Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz asking that inspectors be allowed to go about
their work, but Aziz on Thursday rejected it.
	   Arms experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its long-range
missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons before the
Security Council will lift sanctions imposed in 1990 after Iraq
invaded Kuwait, touching off the Gulf war.
	   The sanctions bar air travel to and from the country and regular
exports of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay.
	   U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said the council's decision to
take no movement toward sanctions relief was ``virtually
unanimous.''
	   ``It's an important step in saying to Iraq that because of your
actions, your violation of Security Council resolutions, your
repudiating the secretary-general's agreement with you, that
sanctions are going remain,'' he said.
	   ``And there is no prospect for lifting sanctions until they
comply,'' he added.
	   Iraq said it was ceasing cooperation with the United Nations
because Butler refused to certify that Iraq had destroyed its
banned weapons.
	   In his statement, Turk said ``the sanctions review showed that
the necessary conditions to not exist for the modification of the
regime.''

Now Owen takes on Arsenal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Yorke signing for Manchester United &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Another big test for Michael Owen.
	   The youngest England player this century, youngest of all time
to score for his country and scorer on his World Cup debut, the
18-year-old Liverpool star also produced one of the best World Cup
goals ever against Argentina in June.
	   With all the records and accolades behind him, Owen now targets
league and FA Cup winner Arsenal.
	   The two English soccer giants meet at Anfield Saturday only a
week into the Premier League campaign and the confrontation may
give a little clue as to where the title will go this season.
	   It's probably more important to Liverpool than for the Gunners.
	   The 1990s have been painful for the Merseyside team since it won
the last of its record 18 league titles in 1990. Watching its
traditionally biggest rival Manchester United win four titles out
of five was bad enough. Then seeing Arsenal beat them both last
season made it even worse.
	   A Liverpool victory at Anfield will ease some of the pain,
especially if Owen can continue his amazing run of landmark
performances.
	   At Southampton last week, he set up one goal and scored the
other in a 2-1 win to start the season in style.
	   Liverpool's new duel coaching team, Roy Evans and former French
national team manager Gerard Houllier, knows that the fresh-faced
Owen can handle the pressure.
	   ``When you look at him he just looks as if he is a well-bred
boy,'' Houllier said. ``But he is a fierce competitor. He is a
winner, a goalscorer and they are his most important qualities.
	   ``As a player you cannot compare him to anyone. He looks young
and fragile but he is not. He is strong, aggressive and brave.''
	   Meanwhile, the Liverpool defense will be strongly tested by the
immensely talented Arsenal strikeforce, which includes Dutch stars
Dennis Bergkamp and Marc Overmars and two more Frenchmen, Nicholas
Anelka and Emmanuel Petit.
	   Arsenal started off with a hard-earned 2-1 home victory over
promoted Nottingham Forest on Monday and, if either shows signs of
any start-of-season weaknesses, Manchester United will take heart.
	   The Reds, who hired Tobagan striker Dwight Yorke from Aston
Villa for 12.6 million pounds (dlrs 20.8 million) on Thursday, are
still smarting from the fact that they surrendered a 12-point lead
in the title race last season and, having been eliminated from both
domestic cups and the Champions Cup, wound up without a trophy.
	   Alex Ferguson's team needed a late leveller from England
midfielder David Beckham on Saturday to salvage a 2-2 tie with
modest Leicester at Old Trafford.
	   Yorke's arrival means that Ferguson has four big name strikers
to choose from with Teddy Sheringham, Andy Cole and Norwegian Ole
Gunner Solskjaer also at the club.
	   Now his team goes to meet a West Ham team which has been among
the busiest in the transfer market, hiring Chilean World Cup
defender Javier Margas, Liverpool's Neil Ruddock, Newcastle
goalkeeper Shaka Hislop and Arsenal striker Ian Wright.
	   It was Wright's 84th minute strike that gained the Hammers a 1-0
win at Sheffield Wednesday for the ideal start and a victory over
Ferguson's team at Upton Park likely could put the Hammers top of
the standings.
	   The leader going into Saturday's games is one of the relegation
favorites, Wimbledon.
	   The Dons, who have not made a single signing since last season,
scored a 3-1 victory over Tottenham nd hopes to build on that by
winning at Jim Smith's Derby.
	   For Spurs, who dropped to last with that loss, the result means
that Swiss coach Christian Gross will start the season under
renewed pressure, especially if his team loses at home to Sheffield
Wednesday.
	   Chelsea, which started with a surprise 2-1 loss at Coventry,
hosts Newcastle in a matchup of two teams whose fans expect big
things this season.
	   Gianluca Vialli's Chelsea won the European Cup Winners Cup and
domestic League Cup last season but the Blues' fans want the team
to be challenging for the league title.
	   That's what Newcastle was doing before last season's alarming
slump which almost led to relegation. A goal-less tie at home to
newly promoted Charlton won't have eased the nerves.
	   Having gained that point at St. James' Park despite the first
half expulsion of defender Richard Rufus, Charlton will be
confident of scoring a victory over Southampton at The Valley.
	   In other Premier League games Saturday, Everton goes to
Leicester and Coventry visits Forest. On Sunday, promoted
Middlesbrough goes to Aston Villa and the Monday night match is
Leeds vs. Blackburn.
	   In Scotland, leader Aberdeen goes to Hearts while defending
titlist Celtic hosts Dundee United. Rangers hopes to gain three
points at Kilmarnock.

Swiss official: Pakistani accounts blocked in drug probe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Pakistan-Bhutto &QL; 
 &UR; By BALZ BRUPPACHER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss officials have frozen bank
accounts of Pakistanis on suspicion of drug trafficking in a
sweeping investigation that has included checks on former Pakistani
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and the current premier, Nawaz
Sharif, a spokesman said Thursday.
	   Juerg Blaser, a spokesman for the Federal Prosecutor's Office,
said the blocked accounts were in addition to the series of bank
holdings frozen in a separate, money-laundering investigation of
Ms. Bhutto; her husband, Asif Ali Zardari; and mother, Nusrat
Bhutto.
	   Blaser declined to say who owned the accounts involved in the
drug-trafficking investigation. He also refused to disclose how
much money is involved.
	   But the accounts were among those reported by banks as belonging
to some of the names on a list of 353 people and companies that
Federal Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte sent Swiss banks last April, he
told The Associated Press.
	   The list, part of the investigation begun by Del Ponte at the
request of Pakistani officials last February, included Sharif's
name, officials have confirmed.
	   After the Pakistan Embassy in Bern complained about the
inclusion of Sharif's name, Del Ponte sent a follow-up letter in
May specifying that Sharif ``is not included among the suspects,''
but was included because of ``the statements of his political
rivals.'' The letter was published in the Geneva daily Le Temps
last month.
	   Officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the list
also includes Ms. Bhutto and her husband, high-ranking Pakistani
military leaders, as well as prominent people close to the current
or previous governments.
	   Swiss investigators have been studying the bank responses, said
Blaser.
	   ``In certain cases our suspicions have been strengthened,'' he
added.
	   He said there were links to the money-laundering investigation
conducted by a Geneva judge, Daniel Devaud, but he declined to go
into detail.
	   On Wednesday Devaud asked Pakistani officials to indict Ms.
Bhutto on money-laundering charges. Last month he indicted Zardari,
currently jailed in Pakistan, on similar charges.
	   Swiss authorities say they have found about 20 million Swiss
francs (dlrs 13.8 million) in accounts belonging to Ms. Bhutto and
her family frozen in seven Geneva banks.

India will block international phone sex numbers : minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ No sex please. Not on the phone.
	   India's Hindu nationalist-led government announced Thursday it
would block all international calls that offer titillating ``phone
sex,'' calling it an obscenity against India's conservative
culture.
	   Communications Minister Sushma Swaraj said the move would not
violate the freedom of speech and information granted by the Indian
constitution, adding the government knew what steps to take against
``sick minds,'' United News of India reported.
	   The state-owned telecommunications gateway Videsh Sanchar Nigam
Limited has stopped calls to over 100 such telephone call centers
and a special VSNL cell monitors their operations, Press Trust of
India said.
	   Dozens of advertisements appear in Indian newspapers and on
television screens every day offering friends to the friendless,
party lines and entertaining hours to those who love to talk about
``anything.'' The models include scantily-dressed women and macho
men.
	   Young Indian men and women know what that really means, and
parents often write letters in newspapers and agony aunt columns
complaining their phone bills have been inflated with international
calls to what they found were phone sex companies.
	   Overseas phone calls are said to cost more in India than
anywhere else in the world. Indians pay up to dlrs 2.66 per minute
to call the United States.

Tobagan striker moves to Reds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Yorke quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Manchester United Thursday hired
Aston Villa striker Dwight Yorke for 12.6 million pounds (dlrs 20.8
million).
	   Manager Alex Ferguson persuade the Tobagan star to sign a
five-year contract in time for a midnight deadline so that Yorke
can play in the next round of the European Champions Cup.
	   ``I've got a new life now, being with Manchester United,'' Yorke
said after signing.
	   ``Coming from Tobago, it's such a small island. Football is
second on the list to cricket, so it is a dream opportunity to play
here, coming from that neck of the woods.
	   ``But I was in the right place at the right time. Aston Villa
have given me the opportunity and turned me into the player that I
am.''
	   Villa originally wanted 16 million pounds (dlrs 26.4 million)
for its longest serving player, a fee which would have beaten the
British transfer record 15 million (24.75 million) Newcastle paid
Blackburn Rovers for Alan Shearer two years ago.
	   In a long-running transfer wrangle, United originally offered a
little over half that and the two clubs eventually agreed a price
on Thursday.
	   The transfer means that Ferguson has spent 27 million pounds
(dlrs 44.5 million) on three players during the summer.
	   He also hired Dutch defender Jaap Stam for 10 million pounds
(dlrs 16.5 million) and Swedish winger Jesper Blomqvist for 4.5
million (dlrs 7.4 million). He also agreed a 9 million pounds (dlrs
14.8 million) with AC Milan for Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert but
the player turned down the move.
	   Yorke joined Villa in 1990 from the Tobagan club St. Clair's as
a 17-year-old. In the last three seasons, he has scored 46 league
goals for the Birmingham club.
	   During his spell at Villa Park, Yorke played under five
different managers _ Graham Taylor, who went on to become England
coach, Josef Venglos, Ron Atkinson, Brian Little and current
manager John Gregory.
	   ``Once he had stated publicly he wanted to play for Manchester
United and not Aston Villa I had no other option but to agree to
his transfer,'' Gregory said Thursday.
	   ``Personally it was a big letdown that a player didn't want to
play for me.''

Pakistani court pronounces death sentences for three hijackers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A Pakistani court on Thursday
convicted three men of hijacking a national airlines plane and
immediately pronounced death sentence for all three, the state-run
Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
	   A special anti-terrorism court in southern Hyderabad headed by
Justice Saleem Ahmad also slapped a 500,000 rupees (about dlrs
8,000) fine on each of the hijackers, the agency said.
	   The convicted men, Shahsawar Baloch, Sabir Baloch amd Shabbir
Baloch, had hijacked a Pakistan International Airlines Fokker
Friendship propeller plane on May 24 en route from southwestern
Baluchistan province to the southern port city of Karachi.
	   The hijackers wanted to take the plane to India but were
intercepted by an air force plane which forced them to land in
Hyderabad. The hijackers were overpowered by authorities and all
the passengers were freed.
	   Besides other demands, the hijackers wanted to stop Islamabad
from conducting nuclear tests in Baluchistan province. Pakistan,
responding to previous tests by neighbor and rival India, conducted
five nuclear tests just four days after the hijacking in the remote
Chagai area of Baluchistan.
	   The death sentence is carried out by hanging in Pakistan.

	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Ethiopia has relaxed its foreign
exchange controls to boost foreign trade, Finance Minister Sufian
Ahmed has said.
	   Ahmed told the government Ethiopian News Agency Wednesday that
the government-owned Commercial Bank of Ethiopia and four small
banks will start handling foreign exchanges dealings.
	   In the past, all foreign exchanges dealings were controlled by
the Central Bank of Ethiopia.
	   Exporters complained that central bank procedures were complex
and stringent.
	   Sufian also said the amount of hard currency available at the
weekly auction will be increased from the current average of dlrs
20 million. He did not give the amount for the increase.
	   The minister said an institution will be soon be set up to
promote Ethiopian exports, which are overshadowed by its imports.
	   Imports climbed to dlrs 1.2 billion in 1997-98, compared to dlrs
630 million in exports mainly from coffee, hides and skin, Sufian
said.
	   Sources told The Associated Press that the the government's
previous failure to liberalize foreign exchange controls was one of
the stumbling blocks in negotiations between the government and the
International Monetary Fund.

IOC medical chief stands by comments on Spain, refuses to resign
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with IOC scheduling meeting with Spaniards and de
Merode &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The IOC's anti-drug chief on
Thursday refused to retract his allegation that sports doctors in
Spain encourage drug use and rejected calls for his resignation.
	   Prince Alexandre de Merode, chairman of the International
Olympic Committee's medical commission, said his comments about
``tendencies toward doping'' in Spanish sport also applied to all
countries.
	   ``There is a tendency toward doping also in the United States,
Britain and the whole world,'' he said. ``It applies to everybody.
Do you know a country where there isn't a tendency toward doping?
It doesn't exist. It's a reality in all the world.''
	   De Merode caused a storm of protest in Spain with his statements
in an interview published Monday in the French newspaper Le Figaro.
	   The Belgian official expressed astonishment at recent remarks by
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, who called for a drastic
reduction in the list of banned substances and suggested only drugs
which are harmful to athletes should be prohibited.
	   De Merode told the newspaper that Samaranch, who is Spanish, was
espousing the view of Spanish doctors ``who have rejected the
ethics of their profession.''
	   ``One must not forget that Spanish sports, for a long time, has
had tendencies toward doping,'' de Merode said. ``A president of
the athletics (track and field) federation was even excluded
because he refused to select athletes who didn't resort to
doping.''
	   Spanish government officials accused de Merode of smearing
Spanish sports with false allegations, and the Spanish national
Olympic committee on Wednesday called on him to resign from his IOC
post unless he retracted the comments.
	   Spanish Olympic committee chief Carlos Ferrer said de Merode's
comments were ``astounding'' and unbecoming of a man in his
position.
	   But de Merode remained defiant Thursday. He said he singled out
Spain only because Samaranch is Spanish and because the IOC
president had given his interview in Barcelona.
	   ``The Spanish outcry doesn't interest me,'' de Merode said.
	   He dismissed the calls for his resignation.
	   ``They can ask,'' he said. ``It doesn't move me at all. I will
be speaking to Spanish officials. There is no reason to get upset.
The idea wasn't to single out Spain.''
	   Samaranch announced later Thursday that a meeting would be held
to clear the air in Lausanne on Aug. 30. Attending will be
Samaranch, de Merode, Ferrer, IOC vice president Keba Mbaye and the
Spanish secretary of state for sports, Santiago Fisas.
	   ``We are all friends,'' Samaranch said. ``We will speak and
solve this problem.''
	   De Merode insisted there was no conflict between himself and
Samaranch. While Samaranch has spoken in favor of slashing the list
of banned drugs, de Merode said the list should _ and will _ stay
the same.
	   ``There is no difficulty between us, no discord,'' de Merode
said. ``This is not a battle between him and me. The list will not
be reduced. We review the list each year, but there is no big
change.''

Council says Iraq hasn't met conditions for sanctions relief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES pvs; Edits &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council decided Thursday that
Iraq hadn't met the conditions for sanctions to be lifted and said
it was extremely concerned that Baghdad has refused to resume
cooperation with arms inspectors.
	   The council held its regular 60-day review of the 8-year-old
sanctions and repeated its statement that Iraq's Aug. 5 decision to
freeze cooperation was ``totally unacceptable.''
	   ``They view with extreme concern the continued refusal by the
government of Iraq to rescind the decision,'' council president
Danilo Turk of Slovenia said in a statement.
	   The United States had sought to make the statement tougher, by
recalling resolutions that warned Iraq of ``severest consequences''
if it obstructed inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission or the
International Atomic Energy Agency from carrying out their work.
	   The effort, however, was blocked by China and other council
members, said council sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The council review came after Iraq rejected a request for
resumed cooperation from the chief weapons inspector, Richard
Butler.
	   Butler sent a letter Wednesday to Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz asking that inspectors be allowed to go about their
work, but Aziz on Thursday rejected it.
	   Iraq announced two weeks ago that it was ceasing cooperation
with the United Nations because Butler refused to certify that Iraq
had destroyed its banned weapons.
	   Arms experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its long-range
missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons before the
Security Council will lift sanctions imposed in 1990 after Iraq
invaded Kuwait, touching off the Gulf war.
	   The sanctions bar air travel to and from the country and regular
exports of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay.
	   U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said the council's decision to
make no movement toward sanctions relief was ``virtually
unanimous.''
	   ``It's an important step in saying to Iraq that because of your
actions, your violation of Security Council resolutions, your
repudiating the secretary-general's agreement with you, that
sanctions are going remain,'' he said.
	   ``And there is no prospect for lifting sanctions until they
comply,'' he added.
	   In his statement, Turk said ``the sanctions review showed that
the necessary conditions do not exist for the modification of the
regime.''
	   Iraq claims it has destroyed its banned weapons and says the
United States is manipulating the inspections to maintain
sanctions.
	   In an editorial Thursday in The New York Times, Iraq's U.N.
ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said Iraq will never be able to satisfy
inspectors because they are asking Iraq to prove a negative _ that
it doesn't have banned weapons.
	   ``The inspectors are searching for black cat in a dark room,
where the cat does not exist,'' Hamdoon wrote.
	   ``How many more Iraqis will have to die because Richard Butler's
team has not yet found another document, which cannot be located
because there is no such document in the first place?'' Hamdoon
asked.

	   The compound was sealed off immediately after the blast by the
authorities. Only officials were being allowed in and out of the
area.
	   One grenade had been thrown and several shots fired, said Deputy
commissioner of the Phnom Penh Municipal Police, Yet Razaque. He
said the Kyodo driver was killed on the street in front of the
ministry.
	   The secretary general of the Sam Rainsy Party, Yim Sokha,
several bodyguards, and reporters were also believed to be in the
building.
	   Sam Rainsy was the apparent target of a grenade attack in March
last year when he was leading a demonstration outside parliament.
Sixteen people were killed and more than 100 wounded in the
unsolved. Sam Rainsy, whose life was apparently saved when he was
shielded by a bodyguard, said at the time that he suspected
Co-Premier Hun Sen, his political rival, was behind the attack.

Sidoti wins 10K walk in double Italian triumph
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with women's shot put going to Ukrainian &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Annarita Sidoti regained her European
Championship title and led a 1-2 Italian finish in the women's
10-kilometer walk Thursday.
	   Vita Pavlish of Ukraine captured the gold medal in the women's
shot put with a heave of 21.69 meters, a championship record and
the best in the world this year.
	   Sidoti, who is also the reigning world champion, led virtually
from start to finish to capture Italy's first gold medal, covering
the distance in 42 minutes, 49 seconds.
	   The Italian had won the European title in 1990 but had to settle
for silver four years later.
	   Erica Alfridi, another Italian, snatched the silver with a time
of 42.54. Susana Feitor of Portugal was just behind in 42.55 to
take the bronze.
	   Pavlish's record throw came in her second attempt. Irina
Korzhanenko of Russia took the silver at 19.71, while Yanina
Korolchik of Belarus won the bronze at 19.25.
	   In the men's 400 meters, the three British sprinters who are
tops in Europe this year all advanced to Friday's final: Mark
Richardson, Iwan Thomas and Solomon Wariso.
	   Thomas led the eight qualifiers with a time of 44.82.
	   Grit Breuer of Germany, the 1990 champion who has served a
three-year doping ban, led the women's 400-meter qualifiers in
50.79.
	   In the 3,000-meter steeplechase semifinal, Italy's Luciano Di
Pardo clocked the top time of 8:26.52 followed by Marc Ostendarp of
Germany and Jim Svenoy of Norway, both in 8:26.92.
	   In the women's high jump qualifying, seven jumpers led the way
at 1.93 _ Russians Yelena Gulyayeva, Viktoriya Styopina, Viktoriya
Fyodorova, and Yulia Lyakhova, Poland's Donata Jancewicz, Austrian
Sigrid Kirchmann and Monica Dinescu of Romania.
	   After her victory in the women's 100 on Wednesday, Christine
Arron is expected to challenge American star Marion Jones'
sprinting supremacy.
	   The 24-year-old Guadeloupe native with orange-dyed hair overcame
a slow start to win the women's 100 meters Wednesday at the
European Championship, setting a new continental record of 10.73
seconds.
	   That was just outside the 10.71 and 10.72 clocked by Jones, who
has run each time twice this year.
	   Both still have a lot to go before they can approach the world
record of 10.49 set by Florence Griffith-Joyner in 1988.
	   ``Now I hope to improve more and stay healthy and do something
really nice next year at the worlds,'' Arron said.
	   If Arron is closing in on Jones, the European men are still way
behind the North Americans.
	   Darren Campbell led a 1-2 British finish in the men's 100,
clocking 10.04 seconds to set a championship record and a personal
best.
	   Campbell is coached by Linford Christie, the retired ace who had
won the last three European titles and the last European to
successfully battle the North Americans.
	   But Campbell was quick to issue a challenge.
	   ``I am No. 1 in Europe now. This is one of the stepping stones
that Linford and I have planned so that we can take on the
Americans seriously,'' the 24-year-old Briton said.
	   Arron trailed Irina Privalova of Russia, who had a flying start.
But with her powerful stride, Arron caught up with Privalova in the
last 20 meters and stole the title and the European record from the
Russian, who is coming off leg surgery.
	   ``Halfway through the race I saw Privalova from the corner of my
eye and I accelerated between 60 and 80 meters,'' Arron said.
	   Privalova clocked 10.83 to win the silver in her fastest race
this year. Her 1994 record was 10.77.
	   Ekaterini Thanou of Greece won the bronze in 10.87 despite a
slow start and set a national record.
	   Arron's performance overshadowed the British triumph in the
men's dash.
	   Campbell, who once nearly quit track to take up soccer, edged
another upcoming British sprinter, Dwain Chambers, who took the
silver in 10.10. Charalambos Papadias of Greece won the bronze in
10.17.
	   Other gold medals Wednesday went to: Kiril Sosunov of Russia,
who cleared 8.28 meters to win men's long jump; Sonia O'Sullivan of
Ireland, in the women's 10,000 meters with a time of 31:29.33;
Tibor Gescek of Hungary in the men's hammer throw with a heave of
82.87; and Tanja Damaske of Germany in the women's javelin at
69.10.

<TEXT>
	   Sam Rainsy was spending Thursday night outside the office of the
National Election Committee to publicize his party's complaints
about last month's election. His party and its opposition allies
claim there were many irregularities in voting and ballot counting,
but the committee had refused to investigate.
	   Strongman Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party won a slight
majority of 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in the election,
short of the two-thirds needed to form a new government.
	   FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party _ which together won 58 seats
_ have threatened to boycott the new parliament and block the
formation of a government unless their claims that Hun Sen won by
massive fraud are investigated.
	   The opposition parties have demanded recounts in hundreds of
areas, but the Hun Sen-controlled National Election Committee
called their complaints ``baseless.''
	   Sam Rainsy said that no international observers have been
keeping watch over election ballots, many of which are unsecured,
since they were brought to Phnom Penh from the provinces early this
month.
	   Sam Rainsy said his own party agents have been prevented from
entering the election committee's headquarters, where ballots are
kept.

<TEXT>
	   Here are excerpts from editorials in publications in various
countries:
	    &UR; ___
	   Basler Zeitung, Basel, Switzerland, on Northern Ireland bombing:
	   Violence will continue in Northern Ireland, at least for now,
but so will the peace process.
	   Some are psychopaths, some fascists and others simply
terrorists. These sick people perpetrated the most cruel and brutal
massacre in the 30-year history of the Northern Ireland conflict.
	   That this massacre took place in times of peace obeys a certain
logic. The people who took a bomb into the center of Omagh and gave
a misleading warning don't want peace.
	   The fact that an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland's
population wants peace or at least a political process concerns
them little.
	   Well over 90 percent of the Republican movement gave their vote
to the Good Friday peace agreement. ...
	   But terrorists need sympathizers to survive. These terrorists
are only supported by a small percentage of the Republican
movement.
	   And this is too little to win the ``long war.'' Sooner or later,
these last terrorists are going to end up where they belong: in
prison.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Sun, London, on U.S. President Bill Clinton:
	   There were many issues to capture the attention of the world's
most powerful man yesterday.
	   The critical situation in Northern Ireland, the economic crisis
in Russia and the hunt for the U.S. embassy bombers to name but
three.
	   How tragic that Bill Clinton's mind was concentrated on Monica
Lewinsky's little blue dress.
	   Whatever the outcome of Clinton's testimony, his very appearance
in court _ albeit via video _ demeaned the high office he is
privileged to hold.
	   Maybe it is unrealistic to expect politicians to act like
angels. They are human beings just like the rest of us, after all.
	   One affair, maybe two, might be excusable. But Clinton is a
serial philanderer.
	   Whatever his strengths as a politician, they are undermined by
his weaknesses as a man. That is the really dangerous issue of his
presidency.
	   A world that has no respect for the leader of America has no
fear of America, either.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Sydney Morning Herald, Sydney, Australia, on U.S. President
Bill Clinton:
	   After President Clinton's extraordinary address to the American
people the most important question is whether it marks an end to
something that has gone on far too long or the beginning of an even
deeper descent into a debilitating political crisis. The U.S.
political system is a model of free and open democracy. But in this
affair the central forces _ the political parties, the media, the
``moral majority'' _ within American democracy have produced a
situation where the original cause is so out of proportion to its
broad political effects the world stands amazed. ...
	   Fortunately, above and beyond this tawdry affair, there is the
monumental good sense of the American people. They, it seems, might
well consider President Clinton morally deficient. But they also
see him as human and, for the job he has to do, not all that bad.
	    &UR; ___
	   Yomiuri Shimbun, Tokyo, on U.S. President Bill Clinton:
	   Will the controversy now end so that he can return his attention
to pressing political problems? This will depend largely on the
extent to which the U.S. public is willing to let bygones be
bygones, and the U.S. Congress, which probably will be requested to
examine an impeachment report from (independent counsel Kenneth)
Starr.
	   (President) Clinton's credibility has definitely suffered a
major blow. It is entirely possible that his support will erode to
the point where he will be little more than a lame duck leader for
the next two years and five months.
	   As leader of the only world's only superpower, the president of
the United States is expected to deal with international problems
ranging from economic instability in Russia to peace talks in the
Middle East.
	   The international community will be paying close attention to
see whether Clinton will be able to put the matter behind him and
return to the role that is expected of him.
	    &UR; ___
	   Sueddeutsche Zeitung, Munich, Germany, on U.S. President Bill
Clinton:
	   Clinton's affair with Lewinsky was stupidity on a grand scale;
his behavior since January was _ regardless of any moral judgment _
a grave political mistake. That Clinton became involved with a
21-year-old intern ... speaks either of hubris (``I won't get
caught'') or of dangerous recklessness, both attitudes a president
cannot afford.
	   In this sense, the affair itself is relevant. Yet Clinton's
constant denial is even more important. He not only lied to his
wife, but he also tried to mislead the nation.
	   The president is not only leader of the superpower, but is
regarded by the majority of Americans as a role model. This is
where Clinton has failed; he has _ like Richard Nixon before him _
in this sense damaged the presidency.
	    &UR; ___
	   La Repubblica, Rome, on U.S. President Bill Clinton:
	   When American President Bill Clinton revealed that he had lied,
trust immediately disappeared.
	   This loss of trust has nothing to do with moral transgression,
it has to do with the threshold of judgment, with the critical
capacity to evaluate the level of danger this situation brings to
the presidency. In this, Clinton painfully failed. ...
	   The whole world was in the Map Room with Clinton, and it wasn't
looking for a marital confession. ... it was looking for the proof
of steadiness of nerves, of critical competence, of intelligence.
	   Or else, America would have wanted to see someone that, even by
tone of voice, realizes the vastness of the disillusion to the
public, even by asking: ``Can I still govern?''
	   In doing so, Clinton would have shown he understood the
importance of this drama.
	   None of these things happened. ...
	   His four-minute address to the country was a sad and pathetic
act from someone who thought he could lie and still easily get away
with it. ...

	   The Jordan Times, Amman, Jordan, on U.S. President Bill Clinton:
	   Thankfully, the climax of this whole affair seems to be coming
to a head, thus putting an end to what some see as a source of
entertaining speculation and gossip, others as a disgusting episode
underlining the moral decay of the U.S., and others still as a
pointless and manufactured media stunt that has long outlived its
worth.
	   Luckily for Clinton, it's only a sexual affair, and lying about
it doesn't seem like it will lead to his impeachment. In fact, the
entire spectrum of the American public is supporting him, under the
reasoning that his private affairs are no one's business but his
own and Lewinsky's.
	   The whole episode does raise questions which in fact are serious
and will probably be revisited once the booming American economy
slows down a bit and people begin looking for someone to take the
blame.
	   The bottom line is that Clinton acted unethically while in
office but not illegally. Perhaps one result of the whole affair
will be a public that looks more critically at the difference
between the two.
	    &UR; ___
	   Vienna Neue Kronen Zeitung, Vienna, Austria, on U.S. President
Bill Clinton:
	   ... A great nation, a superpower, THE superpower with worldwide
responsibility for democracy, peace, human rights _ and what does
it deal with? The sperm traces of its president on the dress of an
admittedly quite pretty aide. If that is not higher or the highest
madness, what else?
	   The underlying problem, because it is a serious one, can indeed
also be formulated philosophically: How seriously, in its impact on
the outside world, can a major power be taken, which indulges in
such madness inside? How firmly established is the superpower
U.S.A. if it surrenders itself with such lightness to the scorn and
mockery of the world ...?
	   On what shaky legs stands a world power that exposes its
president _ the most important man in global politics _ to a
five-hour questioning on an extramarital affair?
	   Has there been a five-hour questioning (period) of the U.S.
president on the economic and political crisis in Asia, which in
fact grows into a world crisis? Do you admit or do you deny, Mr.
President, that you to blame, or partly to blame, for this crisis?
	    &UR; ___
	   Liberation, Paris, on U.S. President Bill Clinton:
	   The Map Room in the White House, where on Monday night Bill
Clinton made his confession of a liaison with a young intern, is
the same where Franklin Roosevelt followed the course of World War
II. That these two activities are connected by the same room gives
a measure of the blatantly pathetic nature of things since the
beginning of Monicagate, Watergate of the poor.
	   Admittedly, the president has brought this on himself. His
irrepressible Casanova instinct, feverishly obeyed while being
fully aware of all the risks, explains this surreal situation. His
propensity to rearrange the truth, to allow himself all the
indulgences that can be bought with minimal confession, has taken
him to where he is.
	   But, the United States can no longer escape a change in its
democracy, weakening itself by wallowing in the pathology of total
disclosure.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Star-Ledger, Newark, New Jersey, on U.S. President Bill
Clinton:
	   It is quite a sight. The President of the United States brought
down to the level of a laugh line in a fifth-rate comedian's lounge
act.
	   Sure, the guy pretty much brought it on himself. No rational
person repeatedly does self-destructive things while surrounded by
enemies.
	   But this drama has played out in a way to disgust anybody who is
not a card-carrying member of the Kenneth Starr Fan Club and who is
not convinced that the election of a Democratic president calls for
continuous investigation to find out just how such a criminally
irresponsible thing could have happened. ...
	   We are devouring our leaders, at the behest of some bad people.
	   We have a couple of choices. We can continue to pitch rotten
cabbages at Clinton, helpless in the stocks, while we demand
disclosure of things we really do not want to know.
	   Or we can leave this depressing story and look toward 2000, when
both Clinton and Starr will be gone. Starr will be gone, won't he?
	    &UR; ___
	   The Star-Democrat, Easton, Maryland, on U.S. President Bill
Clinton:
	   Liar. Sneaky. Insincere. Equivocating. Dishonest. These are not
words Americans want to hear associated with the presidency of this
nation. Yet all of these words and more such derogatory terms are
being used this week to describe our current president, William
Clinton.
	   While the words are linked to Mr. Clinton, they diminish not
just Bill Clinton but the presidency as well.
	   At home, many Americans are, at the very least, deeply
disappointed by President Clinton's behavior that brought on this
scandal. They also are disappointed at his fierce denial these past
seven months that he had an affair with Monica Lewinsky. And they
are disappointed with the way in which Mr. Clinton has chosen _ at
last _ to own up to his misdeeds.
	   His speech to the nation Monday evening was an exercise in
insincerity. He never came out and said directly that he did what
we all know he did. He never said, ``I lied.''
	   ... Today, as Bill Clinton celebrates his 52nd birthday, is he
honest enough with himself to see all the opportunity for good that
he has just thrown away?
	    &UR; ___
	   Lincoln Journal-Star, Lincoln, Nebraska, on U.S. President Bill
Clinton:
	   Bill Clinton should resign as president.
	   He has created a sordid mess. He has prolonged it with lies. The
nation wants to put this tormenting distraction behind it. Clinton
is the only person who can bring this matter to a clean, quick end.
	   His statement to the country Monday night was an artful
concoction that fell far short of being candid. ...
	   He has disgraced himself and the presidency. ...
	   He trifled with the laws against perjury. ...
	   Clinton could remain in office for two more years with his
presidency in tatters, or proceed with weeks of hearings, dragging
out trashy details, further besmirching the presidency. ...
	   Meanwhile, important matters of government are unattended. The
world's sole remaining superpower is transfixed by gossip. Foreign
policy drifts. Congress is distracted. Domestic issues are ignored.
...
	   For the good of the country Clinton should resign.

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The International Olympic Committee
on Thursday proposed setting up an anti-doping agency to coordinate
the worldwide fight against performance-enhancing drugs.
	   The IOC executive board called for the creation of an ``Olympic
movement anti-doping agency'' that would be responsible for random,
out-of-competition drug testing around the world.
	   The proposal was the highlight of a series of measures announced
at the end of a special one-day emergency meeting convened in the
wake of a summer of drug scandals in sport.
	   At present, the IOC is directly responsible for drug testing
only during the Olympic Games themselves, with international sports
federations supervising the doping controls the rest of the time.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said the proposed agency
would be funded by Olympic television revenues and would assist
those international federations which can't afford regular
drug-testing programs.
	   The agency would also help set up testing labs in Africa and
Central and South America and create a ``flying lab'' that would
travel to major events around the world, such as the Pan Am Games,
African Games and Central American Games, to conduct testing.
	   Samaranch said the agency would be under the aegis of all
Olympic bodies, not just the IOC, and would have an independent
status. He said it would be headquartered in Lausanne and headed by
an IOC official.
	   Other details, including how much the agency would cost and how
many tests it would carry out, will be worked out later.
	   The proposed agency will be put forward for approval at a
special worldwide doping summit in Lausanne next Feb. 2-3,
Samaranch said.
	   ``This agency will make us stronger than before,'' IOC medical
commission chairman Prince Alexandre de Merode said. ``To be united
is a key success of the anti-doping fight. We all have to be
unified in this battle.''
	   But de Merode stressed that the Olympic movement will never
succeed in wiping out doping completely.
	   ``We will never win,'' he said. ``We will never eliminate
doping. But we will not lose.''
	   The IOC also appointed its four vice presidents to lead task
forces on four general topics for the February summit:
	   _ the protection of athletes
	   _ political and legal issues, including the definition of doping
and cooperation with governments
	   _ ethics, prevention and education
	   _ financial questions, including the commercial pressures which
can lead to drug use and the issue of financing the anti-doping
fight
	   Anita DeFrantz of the United States will lead the task force on
protection of athletes, Keba Mbaye of Senegal on the political and
legal questions, Pal Schmitt of Hungary on ethics, and Dick Pound
of Canada on the financial matters.
	   Samaranch also clarified the controversial remarks he made in a
Spanish newspaper interview, in which he called for a drastic
reduction in the list of banned substances and suggested that only
drugs which are harmful to an athlete's health should be
prohibited.
	   ``I never said performance-enhancing drugs must be withdrawn
from the list,'' Samaranch told a news conference. ``I would like
to ask the medical commission to review the list like they are
doing from time to time. Maybe we need to put the list up to date.
	   ``As for performance-enhancing drugs, there is not a single one
that is not harming the health of the athletes. We will not
withdraw one single performance-enhancing drug which we have on the
list.
	   ``Doping is something we can not permit. First, we have an
obligation to protect the health of the athletes, and second, it's
a kind of cheating we can not accept in sport.''
	   Samaranch said the next big challenge is to get all Olympic
sports federations to approve the IOC's proposed medical code,
which would unify testing, procedures and sanctions.
	   ``Even if the agency works in the right way, we must have the
approval of a single medical code for all the international
federations,'' he said. ``It's not possible that a drug is
permitted in one federation and not in another.''
	   Samaranch said the IOC would push for further involvement by
governments and national law enforcement agencies in cracking down
on drug producers and traffickers. The world's major drug
manufacturers will be invited to the February summit.
	   Earlier, the IOC board heard a report from Tour de France
organizer Jean-Claude Killy on the doping scandals which tarnished
this summer's race.
	   Killy, a French IOC member and winner of three gold medals in
alpine skiing at the 1968 Grenoble Olympics, is president of the
company which runs the Tour de France.
	   This summer's race was thrown into turmoil by a series of
arrests and police raids which uncovered systematic use of the
banned endurance-boosting hormone EPO.
	   ``It was bad for sports in general and means we should make
decisions now and take steps that aim to correct the problem of
doping,'' Killy said.
	   Describing the Tour's drug crisis as the catalyst for a new
worldwide anti-doping effort, Killy made a 30-minute presentation
to the closed-door meeting.
	   ``It was important (IOC officials) hear about the Tour de
France,'' he said. ``All of it started during the Tour de France.
They called someone who lived through it for three weeks.''
	   Killy said he made specific propopals to the board for fighting
drug use. Without giving details, he described them as ``very
concrete, very positive, very realistic.''

 &UR; Grief-stricken Omagh asks God: Why did 28 have to die? &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout for AMs &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A choir singer, a beautician, a
Sunday school teacher, a charity worker, a shopkeeper, a farmer, a
cashier and a student. The final eight people slain in Northern
Ireland's deadliest attack were laid to rest Thursday in this
grief-seared town.
	   Methodist President David Kerr told the weeping parents of Julie
Hughes that there was ``no answer on this side of eternity'' why
their 21-year-old daughter and 27 others had to die Saturday in an
attack by Irish Republican Army dissidents.
	   Medical officials on Thursday raised the number of people
injured to 330, 78 of whom remained hospitalized, seven in critical
condition.
	   Police appealing for more information also disclosed that two
men were seen walking away from the car packed with 500 pounds (225
kg) of explosives 40 minutes before the blast.
	   Like many other victims, Ms. Hughes _ who had come home from
Scotland's Dundee University to work for the summer in a film
processors _ died because phoned warnings misled police into
evacuating workers and shoppers toward the bomb.
	   Kerr said the past few days of horror, however, had demonstrated
``that compassion has far greater power than a 500-pound bomb.''
	   At service after service, ministers and mourners committed
themselves to work harder for Christian forgiveness and the success
of April's agreement on how Protestants and Catholics should
jointly govern Northern Ireland.
	   ``Omagh must mark the moment when our people stopped spilling
blood together, and began spilling sweat together in building a new
society,'' said Seamus Mallon, Catholic deputy leader of Northern
Ireland's new cross-community Assembly, who attended Ms. Hughes'
funeral at Omagh Methodist.
	   At the rural Anglican Church of the Holy Trinity, Catholic
priest Kevin Mullan took part in remembrance of Samantha McFarland,
a 17-year-old volunteer for the foreign-aid charity Oxfam.
	   She and 15-year-old Lorraine Wilson, who was buried Wednesday,
often talked about traveling the world together _ and were both
evacuated from Omagh's Oxfam shop into the line of fire.
	   ``This appalling act of terrorism and savagery has united the
people of the town in shock and grief,'' said the Anglican
minister, the Rev. Derek Quinn. ``The bomb claimed Protestant and
Catholic alike, and we need each other more than ever.''
	   Tears rolled down Richard McFarland's cheeks as he paid tribute
to his younger sister.
	   ``Samantha's desire was to travel the world and she told Mum
every week that she wanted to do it,'' he said. ``She can now
travel with Lorraine where she wants, because the human soul knows
no boundaries.''
	   Ann McCombe, 49, was devoted to Bible study and the choir at
Mountjoy Presbyterian Church north of Omagh. Like two coworkers at
a fabric shop, she was killed after being evacuated from the safety
of the store.
	   Holding up Mrs. McCombe's personally annotated Bible,
Presbyterian Rev. Ian Mairs urged her husband and two sons not to
bear the ``burden'' of judging her killers.
	   He said the bombers would one day have to account to God ``for
every life they have taken, for every limb that has been lost, for
every pain they have inflicted.''
	   McCombe's best friend at the shop, Geraldine Breslin, 43, also
was buried Thursday, along with beautician Deborah Cartwright, 20;
Sunday school teacher Esther Gibson, 36, who was planning her
wedding; Elizabeth Rush, 57, slain in the rubble of her pine and
canework shop; and farmer Brian McCrory, 54.
	   Sixteen people were buried Wednesday, and four others Tuesday _
including a 12-year-old Spanish exchange student and his teacher in
Madrid, the first foreign tourists ever killed in Northern
Ireland's conflict.
	   A memorial service was planned Thursday in Madrid for the two
Spaniards.

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Thirty years after Soviet tanks
smothered the democratic reforms of the ``Prague Spring,'' Czechs
are looking back at the Soviet-led invasion with a mixture of
nostalgia, cynicism _ and silence.
	   On August 21, 1968, five armies of the Soviet-dominated Warsaw
Pact entered Czechoslovakia, kidnapped the country's leaders and
put an abrupt end to nine months of free speech and assembly
unprecedented in the Soviet bloc.
	   About a hundred people were killed in the invasion, and Soviet
military bases sprang up around the country. Hundreds of thousands
fled in fear of political revenge.
	   In a speech Thursday broadcast by Czech radio, ailing President
Vaclav Havel said the Soviet-led invasion ``revealed what Communism
really means.''
	   ``It revealed its totalitarian character, '' Havel said. ``From
France to Russia, it had a fundamental impact'' on public
perceptions of the nature of the Communist system.
	   But while many Czechs still remember the painful events, the
more recent 1989 anti-communist revolution seems to have dwarfed
the historical significance of Czech Communist leader Alexander
Dubcek's failed attempt to reform the Marxist system.
	   The country planned no official commemoration of the invasion, a
remarkable decision in itself.
	   ``I remember my parents talking about it. I know it was
terrible, but I never quite understood what really happened,'' said
Miroslav Sehnal, a 33-year-old waiter. ``At any rate, the (1989
anti-communist) revolution was the real thing for me.''
	   Facing international outrage in 1968, Moscow tried to justify
the invasion as ``international assistance'' given to orthodox
Communists defending socialism from Czechoslovak leaders who the
Soviets claimed were bent on destroying, not reforming, the
communist system.
	   Still, most Czechs see the invasion as an act of aggression.
According to a poll by Sofres-Factum that was conducted among 1,085
Czechs in July, only 3 percent approved of it. The local polling
agency provided no margin of error.
	   Despite the consensus, many questions loom for the average
Czech: Did the experiment in communist reform change anything? Was
it worth the suffering?
	   And would it have really been possible to reshape the system had
Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev not crushed the effort so brutally?
	   No one seems to be offering answers.
	   Leading politicians such as Prime Minister Milos Zeman and his
rival, former Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, are largely ignoring the
anniversary, busy focusing on local politics.
	   Havel and writer Milan Kundera have clashed over the importance
of the Prague Spring shortly after the invasion.
	   Havel argued that Dubcek's efforts were pointless because the
Communist regime was unreformable. Kundera declared Prague Spring
``a moment of stardom'' for the Czechs.
	   History made Havel the president. Kundera became a best-selling
author exiled in Paris. The two different viewpoints remain.
	   Some say Czechs should have held on to their ideals longer after
the invasion.
	   ``There is a whole range of possibilities between resignation
and military resistance ... we gave up too fast,'' Petr Pithart, a
Communist-turned-dissident who now serves as speaker of the Czech
Senate, told the newspaper Lidove Noviny.
	   Others still say reforming communism was impossible.
	   There is no doubt the 1968 crackdown on reformers is politically
linked to the 1989 revolution, which also paved the way for the
breakup of Czechoslovakia into two countries, the Czech Republic
and Slovakia.
	   Charter 77, a dissident movement that helped bring about the
change, was established by Prague Spring veterans, including Havel.
It focused on human rights rather than politics, bringing together
former Communists, intellectuals as well as Catholic priests.
	   Paradoxically, the greatest praise for Dubcek and his allies
currently comes from Russia, which stifled the reforms.
	   Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader whose perestroika
precipitated the collapse of the Soviet Union, thinks the Prague
Spring was a major turning point.
	   ``It was the beginning of the end of the totalitarian system,''
he recently told Narodna Obroda, a Slovak daily.
	   ``It was also this influence that gave me the courage to start
fundamental change.''

	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ Standing before a dusty shrine to the
biblical figure Joseph, the Palestinian governor of Nablus declared
Thursday that he won't let dozens of Jewish settlers holed up
inside the compound leave unless they all go together.
	   Settlers responded that the group would not leave unless others
are allowed to take their place, Israel radio said.
	   The latest exchange signaled that efforts to negotiate an end to
the standoff are failing. Israeli opposition legislator Yossi Sarid
warned that the situation was becoming increasingly explosive.
	   Despite such statements, the army said an agreement had been
reached which would allow the group to stay temporarily but the
deal could not be immediately confirmed by the Palestinians.

CNN to disappear from Amsterdam's screens in cable fee dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS in 9th graf that CNN doesn't pay for cable access to
other Dutch cities, sted other cities worldwide. &QL; 
 &UR; By WILLIAM J. KOLE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Cable News Network said Thursday
it will pull out of Amsterdam next week because of a fee dispute,
making the Dutch capital the only major European city without its
round-the-clock coverage.
	   In a statement, CNN International harshly criticized a demand
from Amsterdam's A2000 cable network requiring a 700,000 guilder
(dlrs 350,000) a year fee and said it would refuse to pay.
	   ``The conditions for renewal imposed by A2000 are so
disproportionate with those negotiated with every other cable and
satellite platform operator anywhere in the world that we had no
option but to withdraw,'' said Phil Kent, president of Turner
Broadcasting System International.
	   ``As a result of A2000's unacceptable demands, the citizens,
diplomats, tourists and business travelers of a major European
capital city will no longer be able to receive the world's leading
24-hour news and information network,'' he said.
	   With its decision to pull the plug in Amsterdam on Aug. 25, CNN
follows music channel MTV Europe, Eurosport and The Discovery
Channel, all of which have gone off the air for the same reasons.
	   Calls to A2000 went unanswered Thursday evening.
	   TBS Europe spokesman Matthijs Spits said his office in The Hague
was deluged with calls from irate viewers.
	   ``People are saying they're going to start action groups to
protest and try to keep CNN on cable,'' he said. ``They're angry.
It's as though the only car in town has been taken away, and now
they have to walk.''
	   CNN ``doesn't pay a dime, not even a nickel or a penny'' to
cable operators elsewhere in the Netherlands, Spits said, and has
no Dutch revenue to offset what it considers an exorbitant cable
user fee.
	   It was not immediately clear whether Amsterdam's mayor or city
council would intervene in any way. CNN has become hugely popular
in the Netherlands and is widely watched both by the Dutch and
foreign visitors, and its loss could potentially deal a serious
blow to the hotel industry.
	   ``After 10 years of distributing CNN's very popular
international service in Amsterdam, it sorrows us that we have to
take this decision,'' said Mathieu Nagelkerke, vice president of
channel operations for TBS Netherlands.
	   CNN will continue to be available via satellite in Amsterdam,
but because it and other popular channels traditionally were
offered on basic cable menus, relatively few people in the capital
have reception dishes.

New Cabinet sworn in by Jordan's Crown Prince

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's new Prime Minister, Fayez was
sworn in Thursday, taking office with a government where the
biggest change was in the financial team.
	   Crown Prince Hassan officiated at the Cabinet's swearing-in,
palace officials said. The prince is deputizing for King Hussein
who is receiving cancer treatment in the United States.
	   The government of Prime Minister Abdul-Salam Majali resigned
Wednesday after a public outcry over polluted drinking water in the
capital, Amman, and parliamentary accusations that it had misled
the country about economic growth.
	   In a letter to the new prime minister, King Hussein made clear
how he expected Tarawneh's government to differ from its
predecessor.
	   The new Cabinet should pursue ``transparency in dealing with the
Jordanian people and inform them of all the facts,'' the official
Petra news agency quoted the king as writing. The remark appeared
to refer to former government's handling of the water scandal, in
which it denied reports of pollution from experts and consumers.
	   The government's decisions should be based on ``accurate
information and statistics,'' the king wrote.
	   The Majali government got into trouble last month when it
announced that economic growth had reached 4 percent in 1997. The
World Bank said the rate was 0.8 percent.
	   Hussein, who has the final say in government, told the Cabinet
to combat poverty and unemployment. One third of Jordan's 3.8
million people are estimated to be living below the poverty datum
line and unemployment is officially 15 percent of the labor force.
	   Tarawneh, 50, has held several previous Cabinet posts, including
foreign affairs and was the chief Jordanian negotiator in the talks
that culminated in the Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty of 1994. He
has also served as ambassador to the United States.
	   The most significant change in the 23-person Cabinet is a new
economic team, headed by Finance Minister Michel Marto and
including ministers of industry and trade, planning and economic
development.
	   Deemed to be more influential than his predecessor because of
his role in spearheading reforms, Marto is credited with improving
Jordan's hard currency reserves during his time at the treasury in
the late 1980s.
	   The new foreign minister is Abdul-Illah Khatib, a liberal
politician. But the change is unlikely to have any major impact as
King Hussein normally handles foreign affairs. In his letter, the
king said he would ``stand by (the Palestinians) until they achieve
their aspirations for independence.''
	   The new Water Minister, Hani Mulqi, is known as a dynamic
politician who maintained a clean record as Minister of Trade,
Industry and Supply.
	   Unusually, the Cabinet includes a former brigadier of
intelligence, Sameeh Bino, who was appointed State Minister for the
Prime Minister's Office.
	   Majali told reporters earlier Thursday that his ``resignation
has no relation to either the water problem or the growth rate
reports.''
	   ``I am happily satisfied with my performance and my government
concurs,'' Majali said, adding that he resigned because ``this
period needs new endeavor and new policies.''

Council says Iraq hasn't met conditions for sanctions relief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Chinese representative calling for comprehensive
review of sanctions; Picks up 6th graf pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council decided Thursday that
Iraq hadn't met the conditions for sanctions to be lifted and said
it was extremely concerned that Baghdad has refused to resume
cooperation with arms inspectors.
	   The council held its regular 60-day review of the 8-year-old
sanctions and repeated its statement that Iraq's Aug. 5 decision to
freeze cooperation was ``totally unacceptable.''
	   ``They view with extreme concern the continued refusal by the
government of Iraq to rescind the decision,'' council president
Danilo Turk of Slovenia said in a statement.
	   The United States had sought to make the statement tougher, by
recalling resolutions that warned Iraq of ``severest consequences''
if it obstructed inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission or the
International Atomic Energy Agency from carrying out their work.
	   The effort, however, was blocked by China and other council
members, said council sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   China, which along with permanent council members France and
Russia are generally more sympathetic to Iraq, said it wanted a
comprehensive review of sanctions, which has been proposed by
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   ``We believe the Security Council should reflect seriously on
the root cause of such difficulties between Iraq on the one hand
and UNSCOM and the IAEA on the other,'' said Shen Guofang, China's
deputy ambassador, adding that China wanted the council to talk
directly with Iraq.

Special international unit ready to handle civil unrest

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A special public security
force deployed to assist international police and troops stationed
in Bosnia is ready for action, an Italian official said Thursday.
	   The roughly-350 member Multinational Specialized Unit, made up
of mostly Italian Carabinieri, is assigned to fill in a public
security gap left by the 1995 peace agreement that ended the 3
1/2-year war in Bosnia.
	   The unit is armed with pistols and rifles, in addition to
shields, tear gas and dogs, but according to Col. Vincenzo Coppola,
chief of staff of the Multinational Specialized Unit, they will try
to keep the of force ``as low as possible in dealing with
civilians.''
	   Coppola said the unit would only use the firearms in
self-defense.
	   The special force is based in Sarajevo, but will have outposts
across the country. It can be called upon to assist NATO-led troops
or officers from the U.N. police force to maintain public order at
demonstrations or other civilian gatherings that get out of hand.
	   Under the peace agreement, handling such incidents was the
responsibility of the local police, but these have often proved
insufficient or even been involved in the organization of
incidents.
	   The force will also assist in providing security for returning
refugees and maintaining public order during the upcoming
nationwide elections on Sept. 25-26.
	   Next week some 70 Argentineans and Romanians will arrive to join
the force.
	   The Multinational Specialized Unit will not be involved in the
arrest of war-criminals, Coppola said.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A grenade exploded Thursday night at
Cambodia's Interior Ministry, where opposition leader Sam Rainsy
was participating in a sleep-in protest against alleged election
irregularities.
	   No information was available about whether Sam Rainsy had been
hurt, but a driver for the Kyodo News Service of Japan was reported
killed.
	   Authorities sealed off the compound immediately after the blast.
Only officials were being allowed in and out of the area.
	   Deputy commissioner of the Phnom Penh Municipal Police, Yet
Razaque, said one grenade had been thrown and several shots fired.
He said the Kyodo driver was killed on the street in front of the
ministry.
	   Yet Razaque said the motive for the attack was not known.
	   Neither Sam Rainsy nor anyone in his entourage at the site could
be contacted. He was accompanied by the secretary general of the
Sam Rainsy Party, Yim Sokha, and apparently several bodyguards as
well.
	   Sam Rainsy was the apparent target of a grenade attack in March
last year when he was leading a demonstration outside parliament.
Sixteen people were killed and more than 100 wounded in the attack,
for which no one ever was arrested. Sam Rainsy said then that he
suspected Cambodian leader Hun Sen, his bitter political rival, was
behind the attack.
	   Sam Rainsy had announced he would spend Thursday night outside
the office of the National Election Committee, to publicize his
party's complaints about last month's election. His party and its
opposition allies claim there were many irregularities in voting
and ballot counting, but the committee had refused to investigate.
	   Strongman Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party won 64 of
the 122 parliamentary seats in the July election, a slight majority
but short of the two-thirds needed to form a new government.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party has threatened to boycott the new
parliament and block the formation of a government unless their
claims that Hun Sen won by fraud are investigated. Opposition
parties have demanded recounts for hundreds of areas, but the Hun
Sen-controlled National Election Committee dismissed their
complaints as ``baseless.''

Police seize more than 200 kilograms of cocaine from cargo ship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Police on Thursday confiscated more than
200 kilograms (440 pounds) of cocaine being carried by a
Cypriot-flagged cargo ship, authorities said.
	   Acting on a tip-off, divers searching the hull of the Kleovoulos
found 248 kilograms (545 pounds) of cocaine in watertight packages
attached to the ship below the water line, police said.
	   The Kleovoulos, owned by the Sebastian Maritime Corporation, had
arrived in the port of Aliveri, about 100 kilometers (63 miles)
northeast of Athens, with a cargo of coal from Colombia.
	   Police arrested the ship's captain, Markos Theodorakis, and the
crew, consisting of four Greeks and 25 foreigners. The identities
of the crew members were not immediately available. All are
scheduled to appear before a prosecutor on Friday.

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to RAISE masterminds slipping out. Edits throughout. &QL; 
 &UR; By ZAHID HUSSAIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ One by one, the masterminds slipped
out of Africa, leaving behind a plan, bombs and hired agents to
carry out attacks on U.S. Embassies that killed 257 people, a
suspect arrested in Pakistan was quoted Thursday as saying.
	   According to a senior Pakistani official, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh
told Pakistani interrogators he was among seven chief conspirators
who left Kenya before the explosion, arriving in Pakistan on
separate flights between Aug. 5 and Aug. 7. Kenyans and Tanzanians
hired to carry out the Aug. 7 bombings remained in Nairobi, Kenya
and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, Odeh said.
	   Odeh was arrested in Pakistan after arriving on a flight from
Nairobi on Aug. 7, the day of the bombings. Immigration officials
who noticed he did not match his Yemeni passport photograph stopped
him at Pakistan's Karachi airport, and he was questioned.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Pakistani investigators questioned Odeh for several days before he
revealed his role in the bombing. By then, any accomplices would
probably have already managed to slip into Afghanistan, where Odeh
said he had been headed, said the official, who was present at the
interrogation. Odeh was handed over to U.S. and Kenyan
investigators in Nairobi Aug. 14.
	   Officials at a Pakistani land-crossing to Afghanistan stopped a
Sudanese and a Saudi on Saturday, suspicious because the pair had
no travel documents. They were questioned as suspects in the
African bombings, but the government source said it was unlikely a
connection would be found. Muslims from around the world routinely
pass through Pakistan to fight with the extremist Taliban militia
in the Afghan civil war.
	   Odeh told investigators in Pakistan he designed the explosives
used only in the Dar es Salaam attack.
	   But the Daily Nation, a Kenyan newspaper, has reported a bomb
containing 1,760 pounds (800 kilos) of TNT was assembled over
several days at a Nairobi hotel under Odeh's direction.
	   Kenyan police said last week they were holding ``about five
people'' in their investigation. Two suspects have been detained in
Tanzania. Their names and nationalities have not been released.
	   Odeh told Pakistani investigators the attacks were planned
starting in July under the direction of a man he called Ali Saleh
and identified as a member of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad group, the
official said.
	   Peter Mbuvi of the Kenyan police said Thursday investigators
there had not heard Saleh's name. Police officials in the Egyptian
capital said the name Ali Saleh was not known to them.
	   The government source, who insisted on anonymity, said Saleh was
an Egyptian and a close associate of Osama Bin Laden, a Saudi
millionaire living in Afghanistan who has urged Muslims to attack
U.S. installations. Saleh led Bin Laden's terrorist group in
Africa, the source said.
	   Before the bombings, a group known as the Islamic Jihad,
considered the successor to the groups that assassinated Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat in 1981, reportedly vowed to strike America
interests because some of its members were arrested in Albania.
	   Odeh's confession clearly links Bin Laden to the bomb attacks,
the Pakistani source said.
	   The alleged involvement of Bin Laden has provoked intense
speculation in Pakistan that Washington is planning to seize the
world's most wanted terrorist from Afghanistan. The swift
evacuation of American embassy personnel from Pakistan earlier this
weak further fueled speculation.
	   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Simons dismissed the reports. Pakistani
officials have said repeatedly they have not been asked to let
their territory be used as a staging ground for a U.S. operation in
Afghanistan.
	   Son of Palestinian parents, Odeh was born in Tabuk, Saudi
Arabia, in March 1965, according to his confession. He joined the
Palestinian Liberation Organization while studying in Jordan. He
acquired a diploma in architecture from the Philippines.
	   Odeh went to Afghanistan in 1990 to fight alongside Afghan
Muslims against a communist government. While in Afghanistan he met
bin Laden, a legendary figure among the Arabs who had come to join
the Afghan struggle.
	   After the fall of Afghanistan's communist government in 1992,
Odeh said bin Laden sent him to Kenya in 1994 to attack U.S.
interests in Africa.

Januszewski of Poland wins men's 400 hurdles gold

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with men's 400 hurdles final, quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Pavel Januszewski of Poland surged
ahead over the last hurdle to beat favorite Ruslan Mashchenko of
Russia and capture the gold medal in the men's 400-meter hurdles at
the European Championship on Thursday.
	   Mashchenko, who has the fastest time in Europe this year, lost
his stride as Januszewski burst ahead to win the race in a national
record of 48.17 seconds, well inside his previous best of 48.90.
	   Mashchenko, whose 48.06 remains the fastest in Europe, finished
in 48.25 for the silver. Fabrizio Mori of Italy took the bronze in
48.71.
	   World champion Stephane Diagana of France fell in the semifinals
and did not qualify.
	   Annarita Sidoti regained her European Championship title and led
a 1-2 Italian finish in the women's 10-kilometer walk.
	   Vita Pavlish of Ukraine captured the gold medal in the women's
shot put with a heave of 21.69 meters, a championship record and
the best in the world this year.
	   Sidoti, who is also the reigning world champion, led virtually
from start to finish to capture Italy's first gold medal, covering
the distance in 42 minutes, 49 seconds.
	   The Italian had won the European title in 1990 but had to settle
for silver four years later.
	   ``Before the start, I didn't believe this result was possible,''
Sidoti said. ``Certainly when we started the walk so fat, I thought
my chances would not be so good. But we succeeded and we have
written another golden page in Italian athletics history.''
	   Erica Alfridi, another Italian, snatched the silver with a time
of 42.54. Susana Feitor of Portugal was just behind in 42.55 to
take the bronze.
	   Pavlish's record throw came in her second attempt and beat her
personal best by 96 centimeters.
	   ``I am just so strong!'' said Pavlish, who was silver medalist
at last year's worlds.
	   Irina Korzhanenko of Russia took the silver at 19.71, while
Yanina Korolchik of Belarus won the bronze at 19.25.
	   In the men's 400 meters, the three British sprinters who are
tops in Europe this year all advanced to Friday's final: Mark
Richardson, Iwan Thomas and Solomon Wariso.
	   Thomas led the eight qualifiers with a time of 44.82.
	   Grit Breuer of Germany, the 1990 champion who has served a
three-year doping ban, led the women's 400-meter qualifiers in
50.79.
	   In the 3,000-meter steeplechase semifinal, Italy's Luciano Di
Pardo clocked the top time of 8:26.52 followed by Marc Ostendarp of
Germany and Jim Svenoy of Norway, both in 8:26.92.
	   In the women's high jump qualifying, seven jumpers led the way
at 1.93 _ Russians Yelena Gulyayeva, Viktoriya Styopina, Viktoriya
Fyodorova, and Yulia Lyakhova, Poland's Donata Jancewicz, Austrian
Sigrid Kirchmann and Monica Dinescu of Romania.
	   After her victory in the women's 100 on Wednesday, Christine
Arron is expected to challenge American star Marion Jones'
sprinting supremacy.
	   The 24-year-old Guadeloupe native with orange-dyed hair overcame
a slow start to win the women's 100 meters Wednesday at the
European Championship, setting a new continental record of 10.73
seconds.
	   That was just outside the 10.71 and 10.72 clocked by Jones, who
has run each time twice this year.
	   Both still have a lot to go before they can approach the world
record of 10.49 set by Florence Griffith-Joyner in 1988.
	   Darren Campbell led a 1-2 British finish in the men's 100,
clocking 10.04 seconds to set a championship record and a personal
best.
	   Campbell is coached by Linford Christie, the retired ace who had
won the last three European titles and the last European to
successfully battle the North Americans.
	   Arron trailed Irina Privalova of Russia, who had a flying start.
But with her powerful stride, Arron caught up with Privalova in the
last 20 meters and stole the title and the European record from the
Russian, who is coming off leg surgery.
	   Privalova clocked 10.83 to win the silver in her fastest race
this year. Her 1994 record was 10.77.
	   Campbell, who once nearly quit track to take up soccer, edged
another upcoming British sprinter, Dwain Chambers, who took the
silver in 10.10. Charalambos Papadias of Greece won the bronze in
10.17.
	   Other gold medals Wednesday went to: Kiril Sosunov of Russia,
who cleared 8.28 meters to win men's long jump; Sonia O'Sullivan of
Ireland, in the women's 10,000 meters with a time of 31:29.33;
Tibor Gescek of Hungary in the men's hammer throw with a heave of
82.87; and Tanja Damaske of Germany in the women's javelin at
69.10.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police and ethnic Albanian
rebels clashed Thursday southwest of here, and France's foreign
minister complained of delays in starting direct talks between the
two sides on the future of the rebellious Serb province.
	   International officials warned of a humanitarian catastrophe
this winter unless the violence stops and civilians can return to
their homes to harvest crops.
	   Hundreds have already died since Serbs began a crackdown on
ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo in late February. The United
Nations estimates that more than 231,000 people have been uprooted
in the months since.
	   Although the level of fighting has decreased since Serb forces
drove the Kosovo Liberation Army from key strongholds this month,
scattered clashes are continuing.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources said one KLA fighter was killed and
three were wounded, including an officer, in clashes which began
Wednesday night between the towns of Orahovac and Suva Reka, about
60 kilometers (37 miles) southwest of here.
	   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
heaviest fighting was around the villages of Zociste, Opterusa and
Samodraza. The Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said Serb
forces Thursday shelled the village of Pantina, about 28 kilometers
(17 miles) northwest of Pristina.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed, although the
government's Tanjug news agency said there were clashes between
police and ``terrorists,'' meaning the KLA.
	   Under pressure from the United States and the Europeans, the
leading Albanian politician, Ibrahim Rugova, has named a panel to
begin talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on the
future of the province.
	   The Albanians are demanding independence from Serbia, the main
republic of Yugoslavia. Milosevic has offered autonomy, which the
Europeans and Americans support.
	   The panel, which has been rejected by the KLA, has not begun
direct talks with the Serbs and has instead been working with U.S.
diplomats to develop a platform and negotiating strategy.
	   Special U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met Thursday with Rugova and
the head of the Albanian panel, Fehmi Agani. The independent B-92
radio said Hill would meet later with Nikola Sainovic, a close aide
of Milosevic.
	   ``The door is very much open,'' Hill said when asked if the KLA
might enter the talks at a later stage. '' ... It is not a
short-time process. It is not an easy process. But this is the
track that we are supporting, this is the track that will
eventually succeed and I hope others will come to realize that and
join us.''
	   In Paris, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine expressed
disappointment at the slow pace of the process. ``We are looking
for ... the beginning of a negotiation, which still has not
started, for this autonomy,'' Vedrine told RTL radio.
	   Despite the absence of face-to-face talks, Agani said the
process was moving forward with Hill dealing with the two sides.
	   ``This is after all the beginning of an attempt to find the
solution in talks and negotiations,'' Agani said. ``The talks are
underway in a way. They are going on through Mr. Hill independently
of some corespondence.''

Botha faces trial verdict
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ The verdict in the trial of former
apartheid president P. W. Botha will be delivered on Friday in a
case that has highlighted lingering racial divisions in South
Africa.
	   Facing charges of snubbing a probe into atrocities commited
under white rule, Botha, 82, could get up to two years in jail or
an unspecified fine if convicted. Due to his age and frail health,
a fine is considered more likely.
	   Botha ignored a legal summons to appear before the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission, which wanted to quiz him on his role as
head of a shadowy inner cabinet that launched a violent crackdown
on black liberation fighters in the 1980s.
	   The resulting contempt trial has cast a spotlight on racial
faultlines still evident four years after all-race elections ended
apartheid.
	   Conservative whites sympathized with Botha's complaint that the
commission is conducting a witch hunt against their race, while
many blacks relished seeing Botha stand trial before a black judge.
	   Bringing Botha to court has been a vital test for the
commission's credibility with many blacks, who say it has been too
soft on apartheid-era leaders.
	   However, Truth Commission chairman Desmond Tutu told a news
conference on Wednesday that he wished the matter had not come to
trial. Asked what his message to Botha would be if he were found
guilty, the Nobel Peace Prize-winner said Botha had no one to blame
but himself.
	   ``You have in your obduracy brought all of this on yourself and
we are still sorry. We are still sorry for you,'' he said.
	   Botha ruled with an iron fist for eleven years until 1989, when
he suffered a stroke and was replaced by reform-minded F. W. de
Klerk.
	   The trial has been held at the courthouse in George, a coastal
town
	   located near Botha's retirement home in Wilderness, 240 miles
(390 kilometers) east of Cape Town.

Israeli jets attack guerrilla targets in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes struck suspected
guerrilla hideouts in southern Lebanon on Thursday for the second
consecutive day, Lebanese security officials said.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties in the 8:15 p.m.
(1715 gmt) air raid, which targeted on hills of Mazraat Iqmata in
the Iqlim al-Tuffah province.
	   The area is a stronghold of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or
Party of God, militia. It faces Israel's self-styled security zone
in southern Lebanon.
	   On Wednesday, Israeli warplanes raided guerrilla positions in
southern Lebanon and near Beirut after an Israeli soldier was
killed and four others wounded in a Hezbollah ambush inside the
occupied zone.
	   Wednesday's raids targeted Hezbollah positions in Iqlim
al-Tuffah and a base of a radical Palestinian guerrilla faction at
the coastal town of Naameh, 16 kilometers (10 miles) south of
Beirut.
	   The Naameh base is used by the Syrian-backed Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, which has opposed any
peace talks with Israel but rarely has participated in guerrilla
attacks against Israeli soldiers in south Lebanon.
	   Iqlim al-Tuffah, a frequent target of Israeli warplanes, is used
by Hezbollah guerrillas as a base to launch attacks on Israeli
troops and their allied Lebanese militia in the occupied zone.
	   Hezbollah has led the fight to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers
and 2,500 members of the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army militia
from southern Lebanon. Israel set up the zone in 1985 to try to
protect its northern settlements from cross-border guerrilla
attacks.

	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Faced with the threat of outside
intervention, Congolese rebels on Thursday sent mixed messages of
war and peace.
	   After capturing Mbaza-Ngungu, about 150 kilometers (95 miles)
south of the capital Kinshasa, rebel leaders said they were willing
to negotiate a political solution and even a cease-fire with
President Laurent Kabila.
	   Threats of a military intervention by Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe to back Kabila appeared to have softened normally
tough rebel talk reinforced by two weeks of uninterrupted advances.
	   In the rebel stronghold in eastern Congo, civilians and
academics from the movement seeking to take power from Kabila
appear to have upstaged hawkish military commanders who had ruled
out negotiations.
	   ``Our problem is political, and the solution must be
political,'' Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, an exiled professor and leader
of the rebel Congolese Democratic Coalition told several thousand
people who attended a rally Thursday in Goma. He said military
action would not bring about a definitive solution to Congo's
problems.
	   Rebel chief commander Jean-Pierre Ondekane and his lieutenants
who had vowed to crush Kabila were not at the rally, nor were they
present Wednesday when the civilians raised the possibility of a
cease-fire.
	   The 36-year-old Ondekane said recently it was he and other
officers and soldiers _ and not the civilians in the rebel movement
_ who were directing the movement.
	   On Thursday, Ondekane said in Goma he was busy organizing the
frontline and that politicians should speak about political
affairs.

Sri Lanka wins final by five wickets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with result
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Marvan Atapattu came out of the shadows of
off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan with a flamboyant century as world
champions Sri Lanka beat England by five wickets in the
limited-overs series final at Lord's Thursday.
	   After man-of-the-match Muralidharan had taken 5-34 to restrict a
runaway England innings to 256 for eight, Atapattu anchored Sri
Lanka's chase with an unbeaten 132 off 151 balls to see his side
through with 17 balls to spare.
	   Sri Lanka choked briefly, slumping from 210 for two to 233 for
five, before the experienced Hashan Tillakaratne, 10 not out, hit
the winning boundary to seal a memorable victory.
	   Coming in at the fall of Sanath Jayasuriya (0) to the second
ball of the innings, Atapattu stayed until victory was sealed while
Aravinda de Silva and Arjuna Ranatunga had fallen with victory in
sight.
	   Atapattu and Romesh Kaluwitharana, 68 off 77 balls, figured in a
match winning 138-run stand which set-up the win.
	   Atapattu, who scored 40 and six in the previous outings, took
the man-of-the-series award. He scored his second one-day century
in his 50th appearence with 14 classy boundaries.
	   De Silva contributed to the win, hammering 34 off 37 balls,
including three boundaries off successive deliveries from
medium-pace bowler Peter Martin.
	   He fell at 210, hooking medium paceman Darren Gough (2-50) to
Alistair Brown at square leg.
	   It was a sweet revenge for Sri Lanka, which lost to the home
side by 36 runs in the qualifying round.
	   The victory was largely set up by Muralidharan, who had the
England batting on a spin after the home side got away to a
brilliant start with a record 132-run opening stand between Nick
Knight and Mike Atherton.
	   Muralidharan triggered another all-too-familiar England
collapse, when he came on to bowl with the score at 191 for two in
the 39th over.
	   Skipper Arjuna Ranatunga made 16 bowling changes among his seven
bowlers _ five of them spinners _ to unsettle the England innings
after the record opening stand.
	   Atherton, playing his first one-day international in 16 months,
hit 64 runs off 73 balls with seven fours to dominate the stand.
	   The partnership eclipsed the previous highest _ 123 between
Graham Gooch and Tim Robinson in Pune, India in 1987-88 _ before
the Sri Lankan spinners wrested control of the game.
	   Muralidharan's fourth spell was too much for England as he took
3-0 in five ball.
	   He caught and bowled Knight, trapped Nasser Hussain (0)
leg-before-wicket two balls later. In his last over, he bowled the
big hitting Brown (18) to finish with his fifth five-wicket haul in
his 99th match.
	   In fact, it is the best bowling performance in 23 one-day
internationals at Lord's, improving on West Indian Joel Garner's
5-38 against England in the 1979 World Cup final.
	   Medium paceman Suresh Perera took two wickets in as many balls
in the 50th over of the innings but missed a hat trick, sending
down a wide that beat the keeper to run for four. He finished with
2-44.
	   It was the third time the England middle order has collapsed in
this series, following 7-24 in 35 balls against Sri Lanka here and
8-69 against South Africa at Edgbaston.

America's enemy: determined, wealthy, Saudi dissident

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ It wasn't unusual to find wealthy
Saudis on the periphery of the Afghan struggle against the Soviet
Union. They'd arrive in Afghan refugee camps, open briefcases full
of cash, and distribute dollars to war widows and wounded veterans.
	   Osama bin Laden was unusual. The son of a Saudi construction
magnate went into the rugged Afghan mountains to fight, gaining a
reputation for bravery and determination. He used his millions to
buy bulldozers to gouge guerrilla trails in the heart of
Afghanistan, and to bring in, by his count, thousands of Egyptians,
Lebanese, Turks and others to join their Afghan Muslim brothers in
the struggle against an ideology that spurned religion.
	   Nine years after the Soviets retreated from Afghanistan,
terrorism experts say bin Laden is using his millions to fund
attacks against the United States like, perhaps, the Aug. 7 twin
bombings of U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania, that killed 257 people. Veterans of the pan-Muslim army
bin Laden raised to fight the Soviets remain loyal to the tall,
robed figure some call a hero.
	   The U.S. State Department calls him ``one of the most
significant sponsors of Islamic extremist activities in the world
today.''
	   Throughout the 1980s, the United States and bin Laden were on
the same side against the now-collapsed Soviet state. Bin Laden
made no secret that he saw secular, powerful Washington as much an
infidel as Moscow. But his first priority was Moscow, which invaded
Afghanistan to prop up a communist government in December, 1979.
	   The few outsiders who have met bin Laden describe him as modest
_ almost shy. He rarely gives interviews. But he has allowed
himself to be photographed, narrow eyes staring intently into the
camera under a white turban, his long, thin face made even longer
by a brush of graying beard falling to his chest.
	   He is believed to be in his late 40s, and to have at least three
wives.
	   In a series of fatwas, or religious edicts, faxed to the outside
world from his hideout in Afghanistan, bin Laden has laid out his
case against the United States: its soldiers protecting oil in his
homeland are desecrating Muslim holy sites with their very
presence; its power has emasculated Arab countries, turning them
into client states; its friend is Israel.
	   ``We _ with God's help _ call on every Muslim who believes in
God and wishes to be rewarded to comply with God's order to kill
the Americans and plunder their money wherever and whenever they
find it,'' read a February fatwa.

Czechs, Russians mark anniversary of Soviet invasion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAN SLIVA &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czechs and Russians marked the
30th anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia with
statements of admiration for those who resisted dictatorship and
calls for reconciliation among those who suffered under Communism.
	   Five armies of the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact rolled into
Czechoslovakia before dawn on Aug. 21, 1968 to crush the reform
program of Communist leader Alexander Dubcek known as the ``Prague
Spring.''
	   The Soviets kidnapped the country's leaders and brought an end
to nine months of free speech and assembly unprecedented in the
Soviet bloc. About 100 people were killed in the invasion, and
hundreds of thousands fled in fear of political revenge.
	   In a speech Thursday on the eve of the anniversary, ailing Czech
President Vaclav Havel said the invasion ``revealed what Communism
really means. It revealed its totalitarian character.''
	   ``For me, the short period (of the Prague Spring) was a time
when one could breathe and speak again after 20 years,'' Havel said
in a speech broadcast by Czech Radio. ``Nobody who lived in that
era can ever forget it.''
	   In Moscow, Russian President Boris Yeltsin described the
Czechoslovak experiment, which Dubcek called ``socialism with a
human face,'' as an attempt ``to escape from ideological dogmatism
and lies.''
	   Yeltsin, in a telegram to the Congress of Russia Intellectuals,
said that ``even shy attempts of reform called down terror from
those who wanted to preserve the totalitarian system.''
	   The leader of Russia's Orthodox Church, Patriarch Alexei II,
used the anniversary of the crackdown to call for reconciliation
among peoples of the former Soviet bloc.
	   Alexei said the Soviet invasion brought ``much sorrow'' to the
Czech people. ``Similar feelings are caused by memories of
bloodshed in Berlin in 1953, in Budapest in 1956 and in Afghanistan
in the 1980s,'' he said, referring to other Soviet moves to enforce
hardline Marxism.
	   In late 1967, Dubcek allowed free speech and freedom of
assembly, arguing that the ideals of Communism and freedom could
exist together. Fearing such views could topple their empire, the
Soviet Union and all its Warsaw Pact allies except Romania rolled
across the border, deposed Dubcek and replaced him with hardliner
Gustav Husak.
	   Communism collapsed in Czechoslovakia in 1989 and in January
1993, the country peacefully split into the independent countries
of Czech Republic and Slovakia.
	   Dubcek was expelled from the Czechoslovak Communist Party in
1970 and lived in virtual seclusion at his home in the Slovak
capital, Bratislava. After losing the presidency to Havel in 1989,
he became the largely symbolic president of Parliament and died in
1992.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Kenyans prayed at a memorial service
Thursday to heal the scars inflicted by ``evil-doers'' who killed
257 people in twin attacks in East Africa, just before the United
States announced it had ordered U.S. armed forces to strike at
``terrorist facilities'' in Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation.
	   Clinton said he ordered the attacks because ``we have compelling
information they were planning additional terrorist acts.''
	   ``Today we have struck back,'' the president declared.
	   Two bombs exploded Aug. 7 at the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and
Dar es Salaam, killing 247 people in Kenya and 10 in Tanzania. More
than 5,500 people were injured, mostly Kenyans.
	   In Nairobi, thousands wearing red ribbons as a sign of mourning
gathered on a grassy hill in downtown Uhuru Park to seek peace and
healing from the attacks.
	   ``It is the day that Satan visited Nairobi,'' President Daniel
arap Moi said during the service.
	   Moi pledged to work closely with U.S. officials to track down
the terrorists. ``The government will not allow Kenyans to be
victims of these inhumane criminals,'' he said.
	   FBI Director Louis Freeh, who later traveled to Nairobi where he
planned a news conference on Friday, met with FBI agents and local
officials in Dar es Salaam.
	   ``We haven't made any conclusions that anybody being held here
is connected at this point to the bombing,'' Freeh said, referring
to the two suspects detained in Tanzania. Their names and
nationalities have not been released.
	   Kenyan police said last week they were holding ``about five
people'' in their investigation.
	   A suspect arrested in Pakistan in connection with the bombings
said Thursday that the masterminds had slipped out of Africa,
leaving behind a plan, bombs and hired agents to carry out the bomb
attacks .
	   According to a senior Pakistani official, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh
told Pakistani interrogators he was among seven chief conspirators
who left Kenya before the explosion, arriving in Pakistan on
separate flights between Aug. 5 and Aug. 7. Kenyans and Tanzanians
hired to carry out the Aug. 7 bombings remained in Nairobi, Kenya
and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, Odeh said.
	   Kenyan and Tanzanian police could not confirm the reports.
	   Odeh was arrested in Pakistan after arriving on a flight from
Nairobi on Aug. 7, the day of the bombings. Immigration officials
who noticed he did not match his Yemeni passport photograph stopped
him at Pakistan's Karachi airport, and he was questioned.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Pakistani investigators questioned Odeh for several days before he
revealed his role in the bombing. By then, any accomplices would
probably have already managed to slip into Afghanistan, where Odeh
said he had been headed, said the official, who was present at the
interrogation. Odeh was handed over to U.S. and Kenyan
investigators in Nairobi Aug. 14.
	   U.S. officials are pressing to get their hands on bin Laden, who
lives in Afghanistan, but they have received mixed signals from
Afghanistan's ruling Taliban religious army.
	   The Saudi millionaire living in Afghanistan has called on
Muslims to attack American installations. Saleh led Bin Laden's
terrorist group in Africa, the Pakistani source said.
	   Police officials in Cairo said Saleh's name was not known to
them. They said that no one by that name has been charged in any
militant cases in Egypt.
	   The Kenyan police's Peter Mbuvi, deputy director of the Criminal
Investigation Department, also said he had not heard of Saleh.
	   In Nairobi, the names of the hundreds who died were read in
batches of six, punctuated by murmurs of ``Lord have mercy'' from
mourners beneath a steel-gray sky. A trumpet soloist played
``Amazing Grace.''
	   U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell, no longer wearing bandages
over the cuts she received in the bombing, promised that America
would help East Africans through this difficult time.
	   ``Together we will dispel the shadows of darkness, emerge from
the veils of grief, and create a brighter tomorrow,'' she said.

	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Shoveling broken rocks and digging with
bare hands in heavy rain, rescuers found 24 bodies of the 239
feared killed in a landslide-hit Himalayan village as 30,000 people
were evacuated to safety across the region Thursday.
	   At least five more major landslides shook the Indian Himalayas
on Thursday after authorities evacuated the residents of hundreds
of villages to safer areas across the region. No casualties were
reported, Relief Commissioner Ashok Kumar said in Lucknow, capital
of the northern Uttar Pradesh state which has witnessed a week of
devastation.
	   The crushed bodies of 24 victims have been found around the
Malpa village in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, submerged on
Tuesday in the raging waters of the Kali River that suddenly
changed its course.
	   Fifteen of these, including nine women, were found Thursday
half-buried along the Kali Thursday, L.R. Yadav, a senior official
coordinating rescue work, said by telephone. Nine dead bodies were
recovered Wednesday as Army rescuers fought stormy currents and
lashing rain.
	   Only 18 survivors _ shivering from cold and in shock _ have been
found so far.
	   The 239 feared dead include Hindu pilgrims headed for a
pilgrimage to a Himalayan lake across the Chinese border in Tibet,
their porters and local villagers who were swept away.
	   No survivors were found Thursday, when the focus of officials
and Army rescuers was on releasing the bottled up water of another
river, the Mandakini, and saving the lives of the tens of thousands
of people who might be at risk.
	   The dammed water formed a two-kilometer (one-mile) long lake
that threatened to drown five towns and 25 villages.
	   Yadav said Army engineers advised against blowing up with
dynamite a blockage in the Mandakini created by falling boulders
and mudslides.
	   At least 37 people were killed in three landslides which struck
Wednesday in the area about 300 kilometers (180 miles) north of New
Delhi where farmers and villagers have stripped the mountains of
their trees for firewood and to make way for terraced crop fields.
	   After two weeks of nearly constant rain, experts predict yet
more landslides.
	   For the third day, bad weather hampered rescue efforts in Malpa,
a rest stop on a popular pilgrimage route to a shrine in Tibet
known as the Abode of Bliss sacred to Hindus and Buddhists.
	   R.N. Singhal, a senior administrative official, said 12
helicopters were on standby at Indian Air Force bases across the
region but had not been ably to fly because of bad weather.
	   In the first available eyewitness account of the disaster, Ganga
Pandit, a priest, said he was awakened by a distant rumbling.
	   Pandit dragged his wife and son from their hut and struggled up
the slopes. Glancing back, Pandit saw a river of water, mud and
boulders hurtle through the valley.
	   The Hindu pilgrims camping nearby also awoke to the rumbling
hills.
	   ``I saw a hill on the east of the village virtually bursting. It
was like a bomb exploding,'' said Pandit, priest of the only
village temple in the valley. ``Within minutes, the shouts and
wails were drowned and all that was heard was the gushing water.''
	   With no motorable roads in the area, soldiers organized in
rescue teams went through mud and crawled over slippery rocks to
reach what an army officer called ``a valley of death.'' Many of
the bodies apparently had been washed away in the torrent.
	   An Aug. 12 mudslide killed at least 42 people and hundreds of
animals in the same region, which also was devastated by an
earthquake in 1991 that killed 341 people. Geologists warned of
worse catastrophes if torrential monsoons continued.

Gronberg leads Clarke by one
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Sweden's Mathias Gronberg carded a
4-under 68 Thursday to take a one-stroke lead over Northern
Ireland's Darren Clarke in the 1.25 million pounds (dlrs 2 million)
European Open.
	   The Swede birdied six holes in wet, windy conditions at the
par-72 K Club. He covered the first five holes in 1-over but the
remaining 13 in 5-under.
	   ``I only hit 12 greens, but was really happy with my putting,''
said Gronberg, whose only tour win came in the 1995 European
Masters.
	   Clarke returned from a two-week break to card a 3-under 69 to
outscore playing partners Colin Montgomerie and Ian Woosnam by four
strokes while two more big rivals, Payne Stewart and Lee Westwood,
struggled to 5-over 77s.
	   ``I didn't play my best golf by any means, but I'm very pleased
with a 69 on a course as tough as this in conditions as tough as
those,'' said Clarke, who took two weeks off to be with his wife,
Heather, and new-born son, Tyrone.
	   Just under dlrs 200,000 behind Westwood on the PGA European Tour
money list, Clarke could overtake his English rival by taking the
first prize of dlrs 343,000 in one of Europe's richest tournaments.
	   With six holes to play, Montgomerie was level with Clarke at two
under and joint leader. But the Scot had three bogeys in the next
four, Clarke pitched to six feet at the 402-yard 13th, and at the
446-yard 15th, sank a 60-footer from off the green.
	   ``I also made one from 40 feet earlier on,'' Clarke said. ``But
I also missed a few from inside 10 feet.''
	   Justin Rose, the 18-year-old Englishman who shot to fame by
finishing joint fourth at the Open last month as an amateur, faces
a third successive missed cut after a 76. It would have been worse
but for birdies at the last two holes.
	   Defending titlist Per-Ulrik Johansson, aiming to win the
championship for the third year in a row, had an 11-over 83 and
needs something special Friday to make the third round.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with decathlon going to Estonian, Russian wins women's
800, trims &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Erki Nool gave Estonia its first
European Championship gold medal since 1934 when he came from
behind to win the decathlon Thursday.
	   Nool's javelin throw of 70.65 meters secured the gold medal for
the Estonian in the two-day event.
	   Pavel Januszewski of Poland surged ahead over the last hurdle to
beat favorite Ruslan Mashchenko of Russia in the men's 400-meter
hurdles.
	   Yelena Afanasyeva of Russia won the women's 800 in 1:58.50.
	   Annarita Sidoti regained her European Championship title and led
a 1-2 Italian finish in the women's 10-kilometer walk.
	   Vita Pavlish of Ukraine captured the gold medal in the women's
shot put with a heave of 21.69 meters, a championship record and
the best in the world this year.
	   Nool, who was sixth after six events, cleared 5.40 meters in the
pole vault and then had the big javelin throw to take the lead for
good. He ended with a winning total of 8,667 points.
	   Eduard Hamalainen of Finland, who had led in the middle stages
of the competition, took the decathlon silver at 8,592. He was more
than 15 meters behind Nool in the javelin, the penultimate event in
the decathlon.
	   Lev Lobodin of Russia clinched the bronze with 8,571 points.
	   The only gold medal Estonia had ever won before was in the
inaugural championship in 1934, by Arnold Viiding in the shot put.
	   Mashchenko, who has the fastest time in Europe this year, lost
his stride as Januszewski burst ahead to win the race in a national
record of 48.17 seconds, well inside his previous best of 48.90.
	   Mashchenko, whose 48.06 remains the fastest in Europe, finished
in 48.25 for the silver. Fabrizio Mori of Italy took the bronze in
48.71.
	   World champion Stephane Diagana of France fell in the semifinals
and did not qualify.
	   Afanasyeva opened a big lead to cruise home in the 800. Malin
Ewerlof of Sweden was second in 1:59.61, while Steffi Graf of
Austria took the bronze in 2:00.11.
	   Sidoti, who is also the reigning world champion, led virtually
from start to finish to capture Italy's first gold medal, covering
the distance in 42 minutes, 49 seconds.
	   The Italian had won the European title in 1990 but had to settle
for silver four years later.
	   ``Before the start, I didn't believe this result was possible,''
Sidoti said. ``Certainly when we started the walk so fat, I thought
my chances would not be so good. But we succeeded and we have
written another golden page in Italian athletics history.''
	   Erica Alfridi, another Italian, snatched the silver with a time
of 42.54. Susana Feitor of Portugal was just behind in 42.55 to
take the bronze.
	   Pavlish's record throw came in her second attempt and beat her
personal best by 96 centimeters.
	   ``I am just so strong!'' said Pavlish, who was silver medalist
at last year's worlds.
	   Irina Korzhanenko of Russia took the silver at 19.71, while
Yanina Korolchik of Belarus won the bronze at 19.25.
	   In the men's 400 meters, the three British sprinters who are
tops in Europe this year all advanced to Friday's final: Mark
Richardson, Iwan Thomas and Solomon Wariso.
	   Thomas led the eight qualifiers with a time of 44.82.
	   Grit Breuer of Germany, the 1990 champion who has served a
three-year doping ban, led the women's 400-meter qualifiers in
50.79.
	   In the 3,000-meter steeplechase semifinal, Italy's Luciano Di
Pardo clocked the top time of 8:26.52 followed by Marc Ostendarp of
Germany and Jim Svenoy of Norway, both in 8:26.92.
	   In the women's high jump qualifying, seven jumpers led the way
at 1.93 _ Russians Yelena Gulyayeva, Viktoriya Styopina, Viktoriya
Fyodorova, and Yulia Lyakhova, Poland's Donata Jancewicz, Austrian
Sigrid Kirchmann and Monica Dinescu of Romania.

IOC medical chief stands by comments on Spain, refuses to resign
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with IOC scheduling meeting with Spaniards and de
Merode &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The IOC's anti-drug chief on
Thursday refused to retract his allegation that sports doctors in
Spain encourage drug use and rejected calls for his resignation.
	   Prince Alexandre de Merode, chairman of the International
Olympic Committee's medical commission, said his comments about
``tendencies toward doping'' in Spanish sport also applied to all
countries.
	   ``There is a tendency toward doping also in the United States,
Britain and the whole world,'' he said. ``It applies to everybody.
Do you know a country where there isn't a tendency toward doping?
It doesn't exist. It's a reality in all the world.''
	   De Merode caused a storm of protest in Spain with his statements
in an interview published Monday in the French newspaper Le Figaro.
	   The Belgian official expressed astonishment at recent remarks by
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, who called for a drastic
reduction in the list of banned substances and suggested only drugs
which are harmful to athletes should be prohibited.
	   De Merode told the newspaper that Samaranch, who is Spanish, was
espousing the view of Spanish doctors ``who have rejected the
ethics of their profession.''
	   ``One must not forget that Spanish sports, for a long time, has
had tendencies toward doping,'' de Merode said. ``A president of
the athletics (track and field) federation was even excluded
because he refused to select athletes who didn't resort to
doping.''
	   Spanish government officials accused de Merode of smearing
Spanish sports with false allegations, and the Spanish national
Olympic committee on Wednesday called on him to resign from his IOC
post unless he retracted the comments.
	   Spanish Olympic committee chief Carlos Ferrer said de Merode's
comments were ``astounding'' and unbecoming of a man in his
position.
	   But de Merode remained defiant Thursday. He said he singled out
Spain only because Samaranch is Spanish and because the IOC
president had given his interview in Barcelona.
	   ``The Spanish outcry doesn't interest me,'' de Merode said.
	   He dismissed the calls for his resignation.
	   ``They can ask,'' he said. ``It doesn't move me at all. I will
be speaking to Spanish officials. There is no reason to get upset.
The idea wasn't to single out Spain.''
	   Samaranch announced later Thursday that a meeting would be held
to clear the air in Lausanne on Aug. 30. Attending will be
Samaranch, de Merode, Ferrer, IOC vice president Keba Mbaye and the
Spanish secretary of state for sports, Santiago Fisas.
	   ``We are all friends,'' Samaranch said. ``We will speak and
solve this problem.''
	   De Merode insisted there was no conflict between himself and
Samaranch. While Samaranch has spoken in favor of slashing the list
of banned drugs, de Merode said the list should _ and will _ stay
the same.
	   ``There is no difficulty between us, no discord,'' de Merode
said. ``This is not a battle between him and me. The list will not
be reduced. We review the list each year, but there is no big
change.''

IOC proposes new anti-doping agency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Signaling a new resolve in the
fight against performance-enhancing drugs, the IOC proposed
Thursday to set up a special agency to coordinate drug-testing
around the world.
	   The IOC executive board, meeting in emergency session to address
the drug scandals which have tarnished the sports world this
summer, called for the creation of an ``Olympic movement
anti-doping agency.''
	   At present, the IOC is directly responsible for drug testing
only during the Olympic Games, while international sports
federations supervise their own doping controls the rest of the
time.
	   The proposed new body would assist in financing and conducting
drug tests for Olympic sports, both during and out of competition,
in various parts of the world throughout the year.
	   ``These tests are very expensive,'' IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch told a news conference after the 7 1/2-hour meeting. ``We
must have this agency to help the international federations which
don't have enough money to do this random testing.''
	   The agency would also help set up testing laboratories in Africa
and Central and South America and create a ``flying lab'' that
would travel to major events around the world, such as the Pan
American Games, African Games and Central American Games.
	   Samaranch said the agency would be under the aegis of all
Olympic bodies, not just the IOC, and would have an independent
status. He said it would be headquartered in Lausanne and headed by
an IOC official.
	   The proposed agency will be put forward for approval at a
special worldwide drug summit in Lausanne Feb. 2-3.
	   Samaranch said the project would be funded from Olympic
television rights fees. He said it was too early to say how much it
would all cost.
	   IOC vice president Dick Pound, who will be charge of the
financial details, estimated that the Olympic movement currently
spends dlrs 20 million on drug testing.
	   ``If we could double that, we could do some big things,'' he
said.
	   Pound, who negotiates the IOC's lucrative TV rights deals, said
the Olympic networks ``would be delighted to know a portion of what
they are paying for the rights is contribution to clean aims which
they will broadcast.''
	   While previous plans for a ``flying lab'' foundered in the early
1990s, Pound said there will be a full commitment this time.
	   ``This is not going to fall between a crack,'' he said. ``It
will either fall into a gaping hope or it will work.''
	   The IOC also appointed its four vice presidents to lead task
forces on four general topics for the February summit:
	   _ the protection of athletes
	   _ political and legal issues, including the definition of drugs
and cooperation with governments
	   _ ethics, prevention and education
	   _ financial questions
	   Anita DeFrantz of the United States will lead the task force on
protection of athletes, Keba Mbaye of Senegal on the political and
legal questions, Pal Schmitt of Hungary on ethics, and Pound of
Canada on financial matters.
	   Samaranch also used Thursday's meeting to clarify his recent
controversial statements in a Spanish newspaper interview. He was
quoted as calling for a drastic reduction in the list of banned
substances and suggesting that only drugs which are harmful to an
athlete should be prohibited.
	   ``I never said performance-enhancing drugs must be withdrawn
from the list,'' Samaranch said. ``I would like to ask the medical
commission to review the list like they are doing from time to
time. Maybe we need to put the list up to date.
	   ``As for performance-enhancing drugs, there is not a single one
that is not harming the health of the athletes. We will not
withdraw one single performance-enhancing drug which we have on the
list.''
	   ``Doping is something we can not permit. First, we have an
obligation to protect the health of the athletes, and second, it's
a kind of cheating we can not accept in sport.''
	   But Prince Alexandre de Merode, chairman of the IOC medical
commission, stressed that the Olympic movement will never succeed
in wiping out drugs completely.
	   ``We will never win,'' he said. ``We will never eliminate
doping. But we will not lose.''
	   Samaranch said the next big challenge is to get all Olympic
sports federations to approve the IOC's proposed medical code,
which would unify testing, procedures and sanctions.

England and Welsh domestic rugby in turmoil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ English First Division Rugby union clubs plus
rebel Welsh clubs Cardiff and Swansea could face expulsion from
their respective Unions as Britain's domestic rugby turmoil reaches
flashpoint.
	   The 14 EFDR clubs _ persisting with a proposed cross-border
British league this season _ Thursday resubmitted the same season
program to the RFU which the sport's governing body rejected
earlier this month.
	   The English clubs stuck to an agreement to play Cardiff and
Swansea in friendly matches on league weekends. The two Welsh clubs
are perilously close to being expelled by the WRU for refusing to
sign a 10-year loyalty agreement.
	   England's RFU again refused to sanction the friendly matches
Thursday and has demanded another program. But time is running out,
with the English season scheduled to start Sept. 5 and the Welsh on
Aug. 29.
	   The clubs insist that two teams should be available on any given
weekend to play Cardiff and Swansea.
	   The EFDR's stance raises the immediate prospect of disciplinary
action being taken against it by RFU management board, with
expulsion a last resort.
	   The WRU has already promised sanctions against its two rebel
clubs.
	   ``The clubs feel strongly that Cardiff and Swansea should not be
held to ransom by their union,'' EFDR chief executive Doug Ash said
Thursday.
	   ``We are obliged to come to their assistance both morally and
legally, and are offering them the prospect of exciting matches
against top quality opposition.
	   ``If the unions are genuine about wanting a British League for
next season, then they should welcome the involvement of the two
top Welsh teams as a precursor to the British League.''
	   The RFU management board gave its support to a British
cross-border league involving teams from England, Wales, Scotland
and possibly Ireland, but has indicated time has run out to start
the league this season.

Castro visits Dominican Republic, once target of Cuban invasion

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ When he was a
rebellious university student 50 years ago, Fidel Castro boarded a
boat with other armed revolutionaries aiming to oust a dictator in
Santo Domingo.
	   In 1959, when he took power in Cuba, he sponsored an invasion of
the neighboring island.
	   On Thursday, the communist leader arrived on his first official
visit to a red-carpet welcome from cannons that boomed a 21-gun
salute, a military band blasting national anthems and cheers from a
lineup of dignitaries.
	   ``To be here in the Dominican Republic, I hardly believe it!''
Castro exclaimed. ``It's been my lifelong dream.''
	   President Leonel Fernandez thanked him for that long-ago attempt
to liberate the island from a murderous tyranny and urged the Cuban
dictator to ``feel right at home.''
	   On a smaller post-Cold War stage in the Caribbean, Castro is
being treated as an elder statesman. He's relished the role,
championing the neglected causes of his Caribbean neighbors.
	   Castro's participation in a 16-nation summit here Friday and
Saturday follows a triumphant Caribbean tour in which he railed
against the dangers unbridled capitalism _ as practiced by the
United States _ poses to small island states.
	   Caribbean nations once were wary of Castro's revolutionary
designs, when his Soviet backing inspired awe and fear from Africa
to Latin America. But today they feel safe embracing him, as a
signal to Washington which has slashed aid to the region.
	   Many of the area's countries have recently renewed trade and
diplomatic ties with Cuba _ most recently the Dominican Republic,
which restored full relations in April after a 34-year lapse.
	   They want Cuba to help them bargain for aid and trade incentives
for their banana and sugar exports to the European Union. In
return, they promise to back Cuba's request to join the 71 former
European colonies in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific that
share about dlrs 18 billion in trade and aid concessions from the
European Union.
	   During the summit, Castro will witness the signing of a trade
agreement between the Spanish-speaking Dominican Republic and the
English-speaking nations of the Caribbean Community economic bloc.
Cuba asked for a similar pact this year.
	   Community officials say they hope to nudge Castro to enact
political reforms as a step to even closer relations. The summit,
said spokesman Leonard Robertson, follows ``our policy of dialogue
and constructive engagement with Cuba.''
	   Anti-Castro Cuban exiles in the United States are using the
occasion to condemn his human rights record _ and Caribbean
democracies for embracing him.
	   ``Once again we are raising our voice to repudiate the attitude
of democratic governments for inviting a dictator,'' declared the
Casa Jose Marti, a Puerto Rico-based exile group that said its
members would go protest in Santo Domingo, 70 miles (110
kilometers) away.
	   As part of unprecedented security measures for his visit in the
face of rumored assassination attempts, the airport was closed when
Castro's plane arrived.
	   Sharpshooters roamed the airport and two Dominican air force
jets and an army helicopter overflew its airspace.
	   Sergio Ramos, another Puerto Rico-based Cuban exile, accused the
Dominican and Cuban governments of fomenting a scare to depict
``every Cuban opposed to Castro's tyranny as a terrorist.''
	   Fernandez, the Dominican leader, has worked closely with
Washington on trade, drug trafficking and money laundering issues
but criticized the U.S. embargo of Cuba. Fernandez's political
party has long had ties to Cuba; its founder, former Dominican
President Juan Bosch, was once exiled there and led the 1949
invasion party, for which Castro received his first military
training. The boat was stopped and the dissidents disbanded before
they left Cuban waters. Castro escaped to his father's farm.
	   The 18-month-old rapprochement between Castro and his Caribbean
leaders is nowhere more apparent than in the Dominican Republic,
which lies just 160 miles (260 kilometers) southeast of Cuba and
shares strong cultural and historical ties.
	   Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista fled to the Dominican Republic
after his ouster by Castro on Jan. 1, 1959. In June 1959, Castro
sponsored a small invasion against then-Dominican dictator Rafael
Trujillo, whose military annihilated the force of some 200
Dominican exiles and a few Cubans. Two months later, Trujillo, who
was then supported by the United States, backed Cuban exiles in a
frustrated attempt to overthrow Castro.

Opposition demands end to election campaign in Azerbaijan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Opposition groups in Azerbaijan demanded
Thursday that campaigning for Oct. 11 presidential elections be
stopped immediately on the grounds the vote will not be fair.
	   A people's congress should be convened to develop democratic
structures in the oil-rich former Soviet republic on the Caspian
Sea, they said.
	   ``The current false presidential campaign must be suspended and
postponed, the election law made more democratic and elections
themselves removed from under the monopoly of authorities,'' said
opposition leader Isa Gambar, a former parliamentary chairman.
	   The head of the presidential administration, Ali Gasanov,
rejected their demands. He said authorities will ``apply the most
rigorous measures'' against those who try to implement them.
	   President Geidar Aliev, who is seeking a second term, faces five
other candidates in the election.
	   Aliev, a Soviet-era Communist Party boss who returned to power
in 1993 in a bloodless coup, has angered western watchdog groups
with alleged human rights violations.
	   Aliev has recently been trying to improve his democratic
credentials and recently issued a decree abolishing most forms of
censorship in the oil-rich country of 7 million people.
	   Meanwhile, the Interfax news agency said authorities released
Sardar Jalaloglu, leader of the opposition Democratic Party, who
was detained by the Interior Ministry's Organized Crime Board on
Wednesday.
	   Opposition leaders said he was arrested in connection with a
large protest rally in Baku on Sunday.

Sydney given green light to proceed with ticket launch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The IOC gave organizers of the 2000
Sydney Olympics the go-ahead on Thursday to proceed with their
ticket launch.
	   ``SOCOG is anxious to proceed with its launch and it will,''
said International Olympic Committee marketing director Michael
Payne, following Thursday's emergency executive board committee
meetings. ``They got the green light.''
	   IOC officials had recently balked at high ticket prices proposed
for the by the Sydney organizing committee (SOCOG).
	   While no figures were released, news reports in Australia
suggested that organizers were proposing prices as high as dlrs
1,000 for premium seats at the opening ceremony. The most expensive
tickets for Atlanta's opening ceremony cost dlrs 650.
	   In response, the IOC set up a four-man working group to study
Sydney's ticket proposals.
	   ``In our on-going discussions on what ticket prices should be,
we went on the basis of past Olympic Games, on what the Australian
market can accommodate, on the popularity of each sport in
Australia,'' said Payne. ``We are continually pushing for full
stadiums, making it so that people can afford to go to the events _
if not the opening and closing ceremonies.
	   ``Now, everything is in accordance with the city contract. SOCOG
will be able to proceed.''
	   At the crisis meeting, called to discuss the growing problem of
drugs in sport, the executive board took time to deliberate
Sydney's ticket package, in response to SOCOG's request that the
executive board committee take a decision before August 27.
	   The executive board committee sent a letter to SOCOG advising it
of its decision said Kevan Gosper, the IOC's Australian executive
board member.
	   ``SOCOG has not received the letter yet but they'll be pleased
to receive it,'' Gosper said.

Januszewski of Poland wins men's 400 hurdles gold

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Estevez winning the men's 1,500, women's triple
jump final, quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Reyes Estevez of Spain pulled away with
200 meters remaining to win the men's 1,500-meter gold medal at the
European Champion on Thursday.
	   Estevez, the fastest in Europe this year in the distance,
produced a strong finish in a slow race to cruise home in three
minutes, 41.31.
	   Rui Silva of Portugal, who was slightly ahead entering the last
lap, held off Fermin Cacho to win the silver in 3:41.84.
	   Cacho, another Spaniard who was Olympic champion in 1992, lost
the European title he won in 1994. Cacho was also silver medalist
at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 and last year's worlds. He finished
in 3:42.13.
	   Erki Nool gave Estonia its first European Championship gold
medal since 1934 when he came from behind to win the decathlon.
	   Nool's javelin throw of 70.65 meters secured the gold medal for
the Estonian in the two-day event.
	   Pavel Januszewski of Poland surged ahead over the last hurdle to
beat favorite Ruslan Mashchenko of Russia in the men's 400-meter
hurdles.
	   Yelena Afanasyeva of Russia won the women's 800 in 1:58.50.
	   Annarita Sidoti regained her European Championship title and led
a 1-2 Italian finish in the women's 10-kilometer walk.
	   Vita Pavlish of Ukraine captured the gold medal in the women's
shot put with a heave of 21.69 meters, a championship record and
the best in the world this year.
	   Olga Vasdeki of Greece upset world champion Sarka Kasparkova of
the Czech Republic to win the women's triple jump.
	   Nool, who was sixth after six events, cleared 5.40 meters in the
pole vault and then had the big javelin throw to take the lead for
good. He ended with a winning total of 8,667 points.
	   Eduard Hamalainen of Finland, who had led in the middle stages
of the competition, took the decathlon silver at 8,592. He was more
than 15 meters behind Nool in the javelin, the penultimate event in
the decathlon.
	   Lev Lobodin of Russia clinched the bronze with 8,571 points.
	   The only gold medal Estonia had ever won before was in the
inaugural championship in 1934, by Arnold Viiding in the shot put.
	   Mashchenko, who has the fastest time in Europe this year, lost
his stride as Januszewski burst ahead to win the race in a national
record of 48.17 seconds, well inside his previous best of 48.90.
	   ``I am shocked to have smashed the Polish record,'' Januszewski
said. ``Even before the race I believed that Mashchenko was the
firm favorite.''
	   Mashchenko, whose 48.06 remains the fastest in Europe, finished
in 48.25 for the silver. Fabrizio Mori of Italy took the bronze in
48.71.
	   World champion Stephane Diagana of France fell in the semifinals
and did not qualify.
	   Afanasyeva opened a big lead to cruise home in the 800. Malin
Ewerlof of Sweden was second in 1:59.61, while Steffi Graf of
Austria took the bronze in 2:00.11.
	   Sidoti, who is also the reigning world champion, led virtually
from start to finish to capture Italy's first gold medal, covering
the distance in 42 minutes, 49 seconds.
	   The Italian had won the European title in 1990 but had to settle
for silver four years later.
	   ``Before the start, I didn't believe this result was possible,''
Sidoti said. ``Certainly when we started the walk so fat, I thought
my chances would not be so good. But we succeeded and we have
written another golden page in Italian athletics history.''
	   Erica Alfridi, another Italian, snatched the silver with a time
of 42.54. Susana Feitor of Portugal was just behind in 42.55 to
take the bronze.
	   Pavlish's record throw came in her second attempt and beat her
personal best by 96 centimeters.
	   ``I am just so strong!'' said Pavlish, who was silver medalist
at last year's worlds.
	   Irina Korzhanenko of Russia took the silver at 19.71, while
Yanina Korolchik of Belarus won the bronze at 19.25.
	   Vasdeki had a winning leap of 14.55 meters in the triple jump to
edge Kasparkova, second at 14.53. Tereza Marinova of Bulgaria was
also close behind at 14.50 for the bronze.
	   In the men's 400 meters, the three British sprinters who are
tops in Europe this year all advanced to Friday's final: Mark
Richardson, Iwan Thomas and Solomon Wariso.
	   Thomas led the eight qualifiers with a time of 44.82.
	   Grit Breuer of Germany, the 1990 champion who has served a
three-year doping ban, led the women's 400-meter qualifiers in
50.79.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Representatives of Spain's royal family and
British and Irish politicians joined relatives of Fernando Blasco
Baselga and Abad Ramos, the two Spaniards killed in the Omagh bomb
blast, for a special memorial service in Madrid Thursday.
	   Up to 200 people gathered at the church in Madrid including
relatives and friends of the two victims whose funerals were held
Tuesday, the day their bodies were flown home from Northern
Ireland.
	   The Spaniards, 12-year-old Fernando Blasco Baselga and Rocio
Abad Ramos, a 23 year-old Spanish children's group monitor, were
among 28 people killed in the car bomb blast in the town of Omagh
last Saturday.
	   Twelve young Spaniards were among the more than 300 people
injured in the attack which was claimed by an Irish nationalist
group opposed to the region's peace process.
	   Princess Elena and her husband, Jaime de Marichalar, represented
the royal family while Foreign Minister Abel Matutes, deputy Irish
Prime Minister Mary Harney and John McFall of the Northern Ireland
Office also attended.
	   Earlier, news reports said the families of Spaniards killed or
injured in the bomb attack would be due full compensation payment.
	   Under British regulations, innocent victims of the violence in
Northern Ireland shall receive indemnity payment regardless of
their nationality, the national news agency Efe said, citing the
British Embassy.
	   The Spanish victims were the first foreigners to be killed in
three decades of violence in Northern Ireland.
	   The Spaniards had traveled to Omagh while on an exchange visit
to Ireland to improve their English.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ State-run Sudan Television announced
Thursday that American warplanes had struck ``strategic targets''
in the country.
	   The television, monitored in Egypt, broke into its regular
programming to give the news.
	   It was the country's first reaction to the attack, which was
announced in the United States by U.S. President Clinton to
retaliate for the bombings of American embassies in East Africa.
	   The television said that Sudan was ``subjected to an aerial
strike by unjust American warplanes that aimed at strategic
targets.''
	   It did not say what the targets where, but said the Al-Shifa
Pharmaceutical Factory in the Sudanese capital Khartoum had been
hit.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said in Washington that the
factory had been targeted as a suspected chemical weapons site.
	   Sudan's interior minister, Brig. Abdel-Raheem Mohammed Hussein,
told Cable News Network that two American planes dropped about five
bombs in three or four runs on a privately owned factory in an
industrial area of North Khartoum.
	   Hussein angrily denied U.S. allegations it was a chemical
weapons plant.
	   ``It is not chemical weapons. It is a factory for medical
drugs,'' he told CNN.
	   ``We have no chemical weapons factory in our country,'' he said.
``We have no chemical weapons factories at all.''
	   The announcer on state-run TV gave no indication of how
extensive the damage to the pharmaceutical factory was or whether
there were casualties.
	   The announcer ended the broadcast by saying ``Allah Akbar,'' the
rallying cry of Muslims meaning ``God is Great'' and added: ``We
will defend our country.''
	   Ali Adam, a security guard at the U.N. office in Khartoum, said
the streets were quiet in the capital.
	   No sirens and no ambulances were heard near the office, he said.
	   ``Up to now i didn't hear anything,'' he said by telephone from
Khartoum. ``Up to now there is nothing.''

Afghan ambassador: We've warned of terrorist camps for years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The ousted Afghan government warned the
United States and the United Nations for years that its Taliban
enemies have been harboring terrorists, the Afghan ambassador said
Thursday.
	   Ambassador Ravan A.G. Farhadi's statement came after U.S.
President Bill Clinton announced that U.S. armed forces struck at
``terrorist facilities'' in Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation
for the twin embassy bombings in east Africa.
	   Clinton said the United States attacked a terrorist base in
Afghanistan and a chemical weapons facility in Sudan. The Aug. 7
bombings of the embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania, killed 257 people and injured more than 5,000 others.
	   ``We have been informing the U.N. and also our American friends
that there is connection between the Pakistani military
intelligence ... and the Taliban for taking care of and doing the
management for all these camps for retaining terrorists.
Unfortunately our view was not taken care of until all the
tragedies happened with the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania,'' said
Farhadi, who is the U.N. representative for Afghan President
Burhanuddin Rabbani. Rabbani was ousted by the Taliban in 1996.
	   Neighboring Pakistan is the only government to recognize Taliban
rule in Afghanistan. The Taliban, known for their extreme version
of Islam, now control about 90 percent of Afghanistan.
	   Farhadi said, ``Pakistan's military intelligence and the Taliban
have been sheltering and training these groups and the young
people. These young people have been sent to Taliban lines for
training.''
	   Since taking the Afghani capital Kabul several years ago, the
Taliban has been fighting a northern-based minority opposition. It
has been making inroads against its enemies in recent weeks.
	   The Taliban spokesman in New York could not be reached for
comment.
	   Clinton said the groups that were struck were affiliated with
Osama bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire whom U.S. officials call a
major sponsor of terrorism.
	   Clinton said the Afghan base was ``operated by groups affiliated
with Osama bin Laden, a network not sponsored by any state, but as
dangerous as any we face.''

	   ``Up to now i didn't hear anything,'' he said by telephone from
Khartoum. ``Up to now there is nothing.''
	   Late last year, a Sudanese opposition group charged in a
statement faxed to The Associated Press in Cairo that the Sudanese
government was making chemical weapons and using them in its war
against southern rebels.
	   The Eritrea-headquartered National Democratic Alliance charged
that the Sudanese government was producing chemical weapons at
factories at three sites: Kafourni neighborhood in the North
Khartoum section of the capital; the town of Mayo, south of the
capital, and Wau, a town some 1,000 kilometers (600 miles)
southwest of Khartoum.
	   The alliance groups opposition politicians and rebel factions
dedicated to ousting Sudan's leader, Lt. Gen. Omar el-Bashir, who
took power in a military coup in 1989 and installed an Islamic
regime.
	   Southern rebels have been fighting since 1983 for more autonomy

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Reyes Estevez of Spain pulled away with
200 meters remaining to win the men's 1,500-meter gold medal at the
European Champion on Thursday.
	   Estevez, the fastest in Europe this year in the distance,
produced a strong finish in a slow race to cruise home in three
minutes, 41.31.
	   Rui Silva of Portugal, who was slightly ahead entering the last
lap, held off Fermin Cacho to win the silver in 3:41.84.
	   Cacho, another Spaniard who was Olympic champion in 1992, lost
the European title he won in 1994. Cacho was also silver medalist
at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 and last year's worlds. He finished
in 3:42.13.
	   Erki Nool gave Estonia its first European Championship gold
medal since 1938 when he came from behind to win the decathlon.
	   Nool's javelin throw of 70.65 meters secured the gold medal for
the Estonian in the two-day event.
	   Pavel Januszewski of Poland surged ahead over the last hurdle to
beat favorite Ruslan Mashchenko of Russia in the men's 400-meter
hurdles.
	   Yelena Afanasyeva of Russia won the women's 800 in 1:58.50.
	   Annarita Sidoti regained her European Championship title and led
a 1-2 Italian finish in the women's 10-kilometer walk.
	   Vita Pavlish of Ukraine captured the gold medal in the women's
shot put with a heave of 21.69 meters, a championship record and
the best in the world this year.
	   Olga Vasdeki of Greece upset world champion Sarka Kasparkova of
the Czech Republic to win the women's triple jump.
	   Nool, who was sixth after six events, cleared 5.40 meters in the
pole vault and then had the big javelin throw to take the lead for
good. He ended with a winning total of 8,667 points.
	   Eduard Hamalainen of Finland, who had led in the middle stages
of the competition, took the decathlon silver at 8,592. He was more
than 15 meters behind Nool in the javelin, the penultimate event in
the decathlon.
	   Lev Lobodin of Russia clinched the bronze with 8,571 points.
	   The last gold medal Estonia had won was in 1938, by Aleksander
Kreek in the shot put.
	   Mashchenko, who has the fastest time in Europe this year, lost
his stride as Januszewski burst ahead to win the race in a national
record of 48.17 seconds, well inside his previous best of 48.90.
	   ``I am shocked to have smashed the Polish record,'' Januszewski
said. ``Even before the race I believed that Mashchenko was the
firm favorite.''
	   Mashchenko, whose 48.06 remains the fastest in Europe, finished
in 48.25 for the silver. Fabrizio Mori of Italy took the bronze in
48.71.
	   World champion Stephane Diagana of France fell in the semifinals
and did not qualify.
	   Afanasyeva opened a big lead to cruise home in the 800. Malin
Ewerlof of Sweden was second in 1:59.61, while Steffi Graf of
Austria took the bronze in 2:00.11.
	   Sidoti, who is also the reigning world champion, led virtually
from start to finish to capture Italy's first gold medal, covering
the distance in 42 minutes, 49 seconds.
	   The Italian had won the European title in 1990 but had to settle
for silver four years later.
	   ``Before the start, I didn't believe this result was possible,''
Sidoti said. ``Certainly when we started the walk so fast, I
thought my chances would not be so good. But we succeeded and we
have written another golden page in Italian athletics history.''
	   Erica Alfridi, another Italian, snatched the silver with a time
of 42.54. Susana Feitor of Portugal was just behind in 42.55 to
take the bronze.
	   Pavlish's record throw came in her second attempt and beat her
personal best by 96 centimeters.
	   ``I am just so strong!'' said Pavlish, who was silver medalist
at last year's worlds.
	   Irina Korzhanenko of Russia took the silver at 19.71, while
Yanina Korolchik of Belarus won the bronze at 19.25.
	   Vasdeki had a winning leap of 14.55 meters in the triple jump to
edge Kasparkova, second at 14.53. Tereza Marinova of Bulgaria was
also close behind at 14.50 for the bronze.
	   In the men's 400 meters, the three British sprinters who are
tops in Europe this year all advanced to Friday's final: Mark
Richardson, Iwan Thomas and Solomon Wariso.
	   Thomas led the eight qualifiers with a time of 44.82.
	   Grit Breuer of Germany, the 1990 champion who has served a
three-year doping ban, led the women's 400-meter qualifiers in
50.79.

Canada's Supreme Court says Quebec cannot secede unilaterally
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with new info, quotes; EDITS throughout. &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ In the first legal ruling on Canada's most
divisive issue, the Supreme Court said Thursday that Quebec _ home
to a powerful separatist movement _ cannot secede without seeking
the federal government's consent.
	   But the high court left open the possibility of a breakaway
arranged at the bargaining table. It said federal officials would
be obligated to negotiate if, as separatist leaders hope, a clear
majority of voters in mostly French-speaking Quebec approved
secession in a referendum.
	   ``The constitution is not a straitjacket,'' the court said in a
unanimous ruling.
	   It said political leaders, not the court, would have to
determine the standards for a fair referendum, as well as the
guidelines for any secession negotiations.
	   ``No one suggests that it would be an easy set of
negotiations,'' said the court, which did not address the
possibility of an impasse in such bargaining.
	   Quebec's pro-independence provincial government, which hopes to
hold a secession referendum in the next couple of years, reacted by
insisting Quebeckers have the right to make their own decision.
	   ``The Quebec people have always had and continue to have the
inalienable right to decide their future for themselves,'' said
Jacques Brassard, Quebec's intergovernmental affairs minister.
``Their democratic decision in any referendum must be respected.''
	   Though separatist leaders rejected the high court's intrusion
into the debate, they were encouraged by parts of the ruling.
	   ``The court recognized the legitimacy of the separatist movement
and the obligation of the federal government to negotiate,'' said
Gilles Duceppe, leader of the separatist faction in the federal
Parliament.
	   Prime Minister Jean Chretien _ a native Quebecker who staunchly
opposes secession _ said the ruling supported the essence of the
federal government's arguments.
	   ``The court has confirmed that any possible process of
independence must proceed in a manner that respects shared values
that include federalism, democracy, constitutionalism and the rule
of law,'' Chretien said in a statement.
	   ``In particular, it has found that the government of Quebec does
not have the authority in Canadian law to effect independence
unilaterally nor does it have such a right in international law.''
	   Chretien's government turned to the Supreme Court after being
shaken by the separatists' near-victory in a 1995 referendum. The
government hoped a favorable court ruling would convince
middle-ground Quebec voters that secession would not be quick and
painless.
	   The court was asked to rule on three questions. Can Quebec
legally declare unilateral independence under Canadian law? Can it
secede under international law? If there is a conflict, which law
prevails?
	   The court said that under Canada's Constitution, Quebec was
required to negotiate with the federal government and the other
nine provinces if it sought to secede. It said international law
did not apply because Quebeckers were not a colonized or suppressed
people.
	   However, the court broke new legal ground by declaring that a
legitimate pro-secession referendum result in Quebec could not be
ignored.
	   ``The other provinces and the federal government would have no
basis to deny the right of the government of Quebec to pursue
secession, should a clear majority of the people of Quebec choose
that goal, so long as in doing so, Quebec respects the rights of
others,'' the court said.
	   Quebec's separatist premier, Lucien Bouchard, is expected to use
the court ruling as ammunition as his Parti Quebecois runs for
re-election either late this year or next spring.
	   Bouchard was the separatists' charismatic campaign chief for the
1995 referendum, when they received 49.4 percent of the votes. He
became premier in early 1996 and had been an overwhelming favorite
for re-election until one of Canada's most popular politicians,
Jean Charest, left Parliament earlier this year to become leader of
Quebec's anti-separatist Liberal Party.
	   The latest polls show Charest's initial edge over Bouchard to be
shrinking, and the upcoming provincial election is expected to be
quite close.
	   If Bouchard wins, he has pledged to call another referendum on
secession, though he has been vague about the timing.
	   Secession by Quebec _ where more than 80 percent of the 7
million residents are French-speaking _ would deprive Canada of a
quarter of its population and split the four Atlantic provinces
from the rest of the country.

Grenade explodes at site of protest of opposition figure

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A driver for a Japanese news agency
was killed when a grenade exploded at the Interior Ministry, where
opposition politician Sam Rainsy was staying Thursday night in a
sleep-in protest against alleged election irregularities.
	   Sam Rainsy was unhurt, but detained by police, and the compound
was sealed off by authorities. He remained detained at an unknown
location early Friday morning.
	   Deputy Commissioner of the Phnom Penh Municipal Police, Yet
Razaque, said one person, a driver for Kyodo News Service, had been
killed in the attack on the road in front of the ministry.
	   Another senior police official, who asked not to be identified,
said the attack took place late Thursday when a grenade was tossed
and shots fired from a passing white pickup truck.
	   About 15 minutes before the attack, he said, Sam Rainsy had
stepped outside the gate to speak briefly with some Japanese
journalists who could not enter.
	   He was allowed in again after an argument with guards, and was
apparently several hundred meters (yards) inside the compound when
the attack took place.
	   The police official said Sam Rainsy and his party were being
held for questioning about why they had entered the ministry
compound when it was closed.
	   About two hours after the attack, Japanese journalists who had
been with Sam Rainsy were allowed out of the compound, and United
Nations human rights officials admitted.
	   A reporter for Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper, Michiharu
Honda, who had been with Sam Rainsy said that 15 minutes after the
attack, ministry guards pointed their guns at the opposition
politician, and one fired a shot at the ground between his legs
when he held up his hand in protest.
	   Sam Rainsy and several of his supporters, including his party's
secretary-general Yim Sokha, were then taken away, some of them
being manhandled, Honda said.
	   Other guards kept their guns trained on the four Japanese
journalists and 10 Cambodian reporters present, and a tense
situation was defused only when the Japanese ambassador contacted
Interior Minister Sar Kheng.
	   ``I think they want to send a very clear warning to anyone who
wants to verify what happened in the election,'' said Rich Garella,
a spokesman for the Sam Rainsy Party, referring to the attackers.
	   Sam Rainsy had announced he would spend Thursday night outside
the office of the National Election Committee _ in the ministry
compound _ to publicize his party's complaints about last month's
election. His party and its opposition allies claim there were many
irregularities in voting and ballot counting, but the committee had
refused to investigate.
	   Strongman Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party won a slight
majority of 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in the July 26
election, short of the two-thirds needed to form a new government.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party and its opposition ally, FUNCINPEC _ which
together won 58 seats _ have threatened to boycott the new
parliament and block the formation of a government unless their
claims of fraud are investigated.
	   In March last year, Sam Rainsy was the apparent target of a
grenade attack when he was leading a demonstration outside
parliament. Sixteen people were killed and more than 100 wounded in
the attack, for which no one was ever arrested.
	   Sam Rainsy, whose life was apparently saved when he was shielded
by a bodyguard, said at the time that he suspected Co-Premier Hun
Sen, his bitter political rival, was behind the attack.
	   Sam Rainsy said earlier Thursday that no international observers
have been keeping watch over election ballots, many of which are
unsecured, since they were brought to Phnom Penh from the provinces
early this month. Final results have not been officially released
yet.
	   Sam Rainsy said his own party agents have been prevented from
entering the NEC headquarters where ballots are kept and have been
sleeping outside the building.
	   A spokesman from the London-based human rights organization
Amnesty International said the group was ``gravely concerned about
reports that violence has returned to streets of Phnom Penh.''
	   ``The organization also fears for the safety of those believed
to be detained,'' said Demelza Stubbings, interviewed by phone.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BURGOS, Spain (AP) _ Leonardo Piepoli of Italy was the clear
winner Thursday of the fourth stage of the Tour of Burgos while
Frenchman Laurent Jalabert closed the gap on overall leader Abraham
Olano.
	   Representing the Saeco team, Piepoli covered the 178-kilometer
(110-mile) stage in 4.29:54. In second place was Jalabert, for the
ONCE crew, at 4.30:19.
	   Olano was not far behind, finishing No.4 in 4.30:29.
	   But the Spaniard saw his lead over Jalabert in the overall
standings narrow to 3 seconds after keeping a 13-second advantage
since Monday.
	   Piepoli's stage win placed him No. 3 in the overall standings,
56 seconds behind Olano.
	   Friday's final stage stretches 167 kilometers (104 miles) and
winds up in the north central city of Burgos.
	   The race is one of the final warm-ups prior to the Tour of Spain
which begins Sept. 5 and ends Sept 27.

U.S. maintains scant ties with Afghanistan, Sudan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with new material, recasts &QL; 
 &UR; With US-Clinton &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The United States has not had official
relations with Afghanistan since 1979 and the U.S. embassy in Sudan
has been closed since January 1996 because of security concerns.
	   U.N. Ambassador Bill Richardson became the highest ranking U.S.
official to visit Afghanistan since 1979 when he traveled there in
April, mainly to promote an end to the civil war there.
	   Since the radical Islamic Taliban group seized control of
Afghanistan in September 1996, its relations with the United States
in general have not been good.
	   The Clinton administration does not recognize the Taliban as the
legitimate authority in Afghanistan. It also has accused the
Taliban of gross mistreatment of women in its application of
Islamic law. Another sore point for the United States is the
presence of international terrorists in Afghanistan.
	   Sudan has been on the U.S. list of countries that support
terrorism since 1993. A key source of U.S. concern have been the
close links the Sudanese government has maintained with Iran.
Although the U.S. embassy in Khartoum has been closed since 1996,
U.S. diplomats make occasional visits there for talks with
government authorities. Like Afghanistan, Sudan has been plagued by
a bloody civil war between the Islamic north and the Christian and
animist south.
	   The State Department's annual report on global terrorism,
released in April, listed both Sudan and Afghanistan as refuges for
international terrorist groups.
	   It said Sudan served as a ``haven, meetingplace and training hub
of international terrorist organizations, primarily of Middle East
origin.''
	   The Sudanese government also condoned many of the
``objectionable activities'' of Iran, such as funneling assistance
to terrorist and radical Islamic groups operating in and transiting
through Sudan, the report said.
	   It added that Sudan has continued to harbor several of the most
violent international terrorist and radical Islamic groups and also
supports regional Islamic and non-Islamic opposition and insurgent
groups in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Uganda and Tunisia.
	   On Afghanistan, the report said Islamic extremists from around
the world _ including large numbers of Egyptians, Algerians,
Palestinians and Saudis _ continue to use Afghan territory as a
training ground and home base from which to operate.
	   ``The Taliban, as well as many of the other combatants in the
Afghan civil war, facilitated the operation of training and
indoctrination facilities for non-Afghans in the territories they
controlled.

Toronto Stock Exchange raises listing standards for mining and
</HEADLINE>
exploration companies &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ The Toronto Stock Exchange is making it tougher
for mining and exploration companies to be listed on Canada's
largest stock market.
	   The exchange announced Thursday it will raise the minimum
listing standards so investors can be reassured about the financial
health of junior companies trying to raise capital through the
market.
	   ``The proposed revisions raise the standards for companies
wishing to list on the TSE by setting higher minimum financial
requirements, stronger technical requirements, and demanding
greater involvement and responsibility on the part of the
sponsoring brokerage firm,'' the exchange said in a release.
	   The change comes in the wake of the Bre-X Minerals fiasco last
year that cost North American investors billions of dollars and
damaged the reputation of Canada's junior mining sector
	   The stock of Bre-X, a Calgary-based junior exploration company,
was listed on the TSE after rising to more than dlrs 200 Canadian
(U.S. 140) a share on the smaller Alberta exchange after the
company claimed it had found huge amounts of gold at its Busang
mine in Indonesia.
	   The mine was later proved worthless after a gold-salting fraud
perpetrated by the company's top geologist in Indonesia was
exposed.
	   Bre-X eventually went bankrupt after its share price collapsed,
leading to numerous lawsuits by investors who lost money.
	   The changes are effective immediately on an interim basis,
subject to regulatory approval by the Ontario Securities
Commission.
	   The new standards require:
	   _Exploration and development companies to have minimum working
capital of Canadian dlrs 2 million and net assets of dlrs 3 million
(U.S. dlrs 2.15 million). Companies with producing mines must have
assets of dlrs 4 million (U.S. dlrs 2.85 million).
	   _Applicants to submit detailed financial projections that
correspond to their work programs.
	   _Increased responsibilities of TSE member brokerage firms that
sponsor mining applicants. For example, sponsors are required to
scrutinize financial and technical submissions.
	   _The minimum market value of publicly held shares to be doubled
to Canadian dlrs 4 million.
	   The TSE is the leading mining finance exchange in the world.
Last year, Canadian dlrs 3.2 billion (U.S. dlrs 2.29 billion) in
mining capital was raised on the exchange, 43 per cent of the
world's total equity mining finance.
	   The more than 300 exploration and mining companies listed on the
TSE accounted for 25 per cent of the exchange's trading volume last
year.

Canadian markets temporarily rally with court rejection of
</HEADLINE>
unilateral Quebec secession &QL; 
 &UR; With Canada-Quebec Secession

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ The Canadian dollar received a sudden but
temporary boost in early trading Thursday moments after the Supreme
Court of Canada said Quebec does not have the right to separate
unilaterally.
	   The currency, which dipped as low as 65.29 cents U.S. in early
trading, quickly jumped to 65.42 cents U.S. minutes after the
court's judgment was released in Ottawa. It later traded around
65.35 cents U.S., up more than a tenth of a cent from Wednesday's
close.
	   ``The initial response from the market has been favorable,''
said Andrew Pyle, fixed income analyst at CT Securities in Toronto.
	   ``The only surprise was on Question No. 2, the ruling that
international law prevents Quebec's secession _ a lot of people had
expected a `maybe' type of response.''
	   On Wednesday, as rumours swirled about the impact of the court's
decision, the dollar fell about a fifth of a cent to close at a
record low, 65.21 cents U.S..
	   The currency gained ground in overnight trading but slipped back
early Thursday when it became clear the Bank of Canada would not be
raising interest rates, a decision that is routinely announced just
after 9 a.m. (1300 GMT)
	   Less than an hour later, the dollar rebounded when news of the
court ruling was beamed from Ottawa.
	   On Bay Street, the Toronto stock market seemed more preoccupied
with international events, including the fate of the U.S. dollar
and a stocks selloff in Latin America.
	   The blue-chip TSE 300 stock index dropped only about five points
to 6,506 in mid-morning trading after opening about 20 points
lower.
	   Sherry Cooper, chief economist at brokerage firm Nesbitt Burns,
said investors and financial analysts weren't surprised by the
court ruling, though the unanimous decision did have a calming
affect on the markets.
	   Cooper said most market watchers, who prefer to focus on the
future, were more interested in hearing from Quebec Premier Lucien
Bouchard.
	   There is widespread concern among investors that Bouchard will
use the ruling as a springboard for a fall election. That would
create a sense of instability in Canada, which is something
stockholders loathe, Cooper said.
	   Indeed, Bouchard's comments in the weeks ahead are more likely
to move the markets _ and the currency _ than anything coming out
of Ottawa.

Attacks in Kosovo as French warn of military action

confirmation of fighting; quotes from U.S. envoy Christopher Hill.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police and ethnic Albanian
rebels clashed Thursday in southwestern Kosovo, and French
President Jacques Chirac told his Russian counterpart the United
Nations may need to order military intervention.
	   In an nearly hour-long telephone conversation between Paris and
Moscow, Chirac told Russian President Boris Yeltsin that unless a
cease-fire and new peace talks come soon, military intervention
ordered by the U.N. Security Council will become ``difficult to
avoid,'' a Chirac aid said.
	   Hundreds have already died since Serbs began a crackdown on
ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo in late February. The United
Nations estimates that more than 231,000 people have been uprooted
in the months since.
	   International officials have warned of a humanitarian
catastrophe this winter unless the violence stops and civilians can
return to their homes to harvest crops.
	   In Belgrade, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met with Nikola
Sainovic, the deputy prime minister of Yugoslavia, Thursday, to
discuss the need to create better conditions for the return of
displaced people.
	   ``We talked about the need to improve access for humanitarian
shipments and the fact that we need conditions to be created so
these people can come home,'' Hill told reporters at a news
conference. ``We are committed to improve those conditions as soon
as possible.''
	   Although the level of fighting has decreased since Serb forces
drove the Kosovo Liberation Army from key strongholds this month,
scattered clashes are continuing.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources in one KLA fighter was killed and three
were wounded, including an officer, in clashes which began
Wednesday night between the towns of Orahovac and Suva Reka, about
60 kilometers (37 miles) southwest of here.
	   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
heaviest fighting was around the villages of Zociste, Opterusa and
Samodraza. The Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said Serb
forces Thursday shelled the village of Pantina, about 28 kilometers
(17 miles) northwest of Pristina.
	   The Serbs' Media Center in Pristina reported ``groups of armed
Albanian extremists'' attacked police positions in Zociste with
automatic weapons and mortars, wounding one policeman.
	   State-run Tanjug news agency said there were clashes between
police and ``terrorists,'' meaning the KLA, in parts of the
province.
	   None of the reports could not be independently confirmed.
	   Under pressure from the United States and the Europeans, the
leading Albanian politician, Ibrahim Rugova, has named a panel to
begin talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on the
future of the province.
	   The Albanians are demanding independence from Serbia, the main
republic of Yugoslavia. Milosevic has offered autonomy, which the
Europeans and Americans support.
	   But the panel, which has been rejected by the KLA, has not begun
direct talks with the Serbs and has instead been working with U.S.
diplomats to develop a platform and negotiating strategy.
	   In Paris, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine expressed
disappointment at the slow pace of the process. ``We are looking
for ... the beginning of a negotiation, which still has not
started, for this autonomy,'' Vedrine told RTL radio.
	   Hill continued his shuttle diplomacy Thursday, traveling to
Pristina to meet with Rugova and the Albanian panel, Fehmi Agani
after his talks with Sainovic.
	   ``The negotiating process is moving ahead and is very active,''
Hill told reporters at a news conference. He acknowledged that
negotiations have so far been very indirect, but argued that this
approach seemed to be working.
	   ``There may be a time when we need to bring the parties together
and when the time comes we'll certainly do that.''

Fujimori removes Peru's powerful armed forces chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ President Alberto Fujimori removed Peru's
powerful armed forces chief from his post Thursday one week after a
military standoff with Ecuador that last week nearly to new
fighting between the Andean nations.
	   The decision came a week after Fujimori negotiated an end to a
dispute between Peruvian and Ecuadorean troops in remote border
region where the two countries fought a brief war in 1995.
	   Gen. Nicolas Hermoza, 63, shook hands cordially with Fujimori
and his replacement as commander in chief, Defense Minister Gen.
Cesar Saucedo, on his way out of the presidential palace.
	   Analysts said hard-liners in both nations' armed forces fanned
the dispute, which stalled negotiations to resolve the long-running
border dispute between the countries that led to war in 1941, 1981
and 1995.
	   Fujimori has said that the standoff nearly ignited a war between
the impoverished Andean neighbors.
	   ``Fujimori was being pressured to remove Hermoza because he was
the main stumbling block in the way of reaching a peace treaty with
Ecuador and ending the conflict,'' said political analyst Mirko
Lauer.
	   But presidential spokesman Ruben Castillos denied that Hermoza
was removed because of the conflict with Ecuador.
	   Traditionally, Peru's armed forces changes its commander in
chief each year, but Hermoza had held the post for an unprecedented
seven years, leading criticism from some parts of the military.
	   Hermoza and de facto intelligence chief Vladimiro Montesinos had
formed Fujimori's inner circle of power, which ruled Peru with an
iron fist since the early 1990s.
	   Fujimori called Hermoza the ``victorious general'' for his role
in helping defeat Peru's leftist guerrillas in the early 1990s.
	   But Fujimori and Hermoza clashed in December when the president
publicly ridiculed Hermoza's claim that he had designed the 1997
commando raid that rescued 72 hostages held by leftist rebels for
more than four months in the Japanese ambassador's residence.
	   Following the clash, Fujimori tried but failed to remove
Hermoza, analysts said.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The man the United States accuses of
directing twin embassy bombings in east Africa that killed 257
people survived U.S. attacks on two of his bases Thursday,
Afghanistan's Taliban rulers said.
	   Osama ``bin Laden is safe and no damage has been done to any of

	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, in announcing the strikes on U.S.
television, had said the targets were linked to bin Laden, a Saudi
millionaire whom U.S. officials call a major sponsor of terrorism.
	   Clinton said he ordered U.S. military strikes after linking bin
Laden's faciilties to the embassy bombings in Nairobi, Kenya, and
Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

New Cabinet sworn in by Jordan's Crown Prince

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's new prime minister, Fayez
Tarawneh, was sworn in Thursday, taking office after the
resignation of the previous government over a water pollution
scandal.
	   Crown Prince Hassan officiated at the Cabinet's swearing-in,
palace officials said. The prince is deputizing for King Hussein
who is receiving cancer treatment in the United States.
	   The government of Prime Minister Abdul-Salam Majali resigned
Wednesday after a public outcry over polluted drinking water in the
capital, Amman, and parliamentary accusations that it had misled
the country about economic growth.
	   In a letter to the new prime minister, King Hussein made clear
how he expected Tarawneh's government to differ from its
predecessor.
	   The new Cabinet should pursue ``transparency in dealing with the
Jordanian people and inform them of all the facts,'' the official
Petra news agency quoted the king as writing. The remark appeared
to refer to the former government's handling of a water scandal, in
which it denied reports of pollution from experts and consumers.
	   The government's decisions should be based on ``accurate
information and statistics,'' the king wrote.
	   The Majali government got into trouble last month when it
announced that economic growth had reached 4 percent in 1997. The
World Bank said the rate was 0.8 percent.
	   Hussein, who has the final say in government, told the Cabinet
to combat poverty and unemployment. One third of Jordan's 3.8
million people are estimated to be living below the poverty line
and unemployment is officially 15 percent of the labor force.
	   Tarawneh, 50, has held several previous Cabinet posts, including
foreign affairs and was the chief Jordanian negotiator in the talks
that culminated in the Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty of 1994. He
has also served as ambassador to the United States.

Israeli jets attack guerrilla targets in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes struck suspected
guerrilla hideouts Thursday in southern Lebanon for the second
consecutive day, Lebanese security officials said.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties in the evening air
raid, which targeted on hills of Mazraat Iqmata in the Iqlim
al-Tuffah province.
	   The area is a stronghold of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or
Party of God, militia. It faces Israel's self-declared security
zone in southern Lebanon.
	   On Wednesday, Israeli warplanes raided guerrilla positions in
southern Lebanon and near Beirut after an Israeli soldier was
killed and four others wounded in a Hezbollah ambush inside the
occupied zone.
	   Wednesday's raids targeted Hezbollah positions in Iqlim
al-Tuffah and a base of a radical Palestinian guerrilla faction at
the coastal town of Naameh, 16 kilometers (10 miles) south of
Beirut.
	   The Naameh base is used by the Syrian-backed Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, which has opposed any
peace talks with Israel but rarely participates in guerrilla
attacks against Israeli soldiers in south Lebanon.
	   Iqlim al-Tuffah, a frequent target of Israeli warplanes, is used
by Hezbollah guerrillas as a base to launch attacks on Israeli
troops and their allied Lebanese militia in the occupied zone.
	   Hezbollah has led the fight to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers
and 2,500 members of the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army militia
from southern Lebanon. Israel set up the zone in 1985 to try to
protect its northern settlements from cross-border guerrilla
attacks.

U.S. has long blamed Sudan for harboring terrorists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The United States has long accused Sudan of
harboring terrorists and has sought to isolate its Islamic
government.
	   Washington has frozen Sudanese assets in the United States,
blocked trade with Sudan and banned U.S. investments in the country
in an effort to limit the power of Khartoum's Islamic government.
	   Sudan, the largest country in Africa, is also one of the
continent's poorest. It has been bogged down in a 15-year civil war
in the south that has left 1.5 million people dead from the
fighting and ensuing famines.
	   Ever since the country's independence in 1956, the country has
repeatedly been torn by dissension between the south _ largely
African, Christian and animist _ and the north which is Arab and
Muslim.
	   The current government, which took power in a 1989 coup, has
been clear in its hostility for Washington.
	   ``America incarnates the devil for Muslims,'' Hassan Turabi,
Sudan's Islamic leader, told The Associated Press in an interview
last year. ``When I say Muslims, I mean all the Muslims in the
world.''
	   On Thursday, U.S. forces struck a chemical weapons-related
facility in Sudan and a terrorist base in Afghanistan that
President Clinton said played a role in attacks against the U.S.
embassies in Nairobi and Tanzania that left 257 dead.
	   Clinton stressed that the strikes were against terrorist groups
affiliated with Osama bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire whom U.S.
officials call a major sponsor of international terrorism.
	   Bin Laden spent about four years in Sudan, leaving in 1995 after
Western countries put pressure on the government to force him out.
Bin Laden returned to Afghanistan, where he was a leader in the
Muslim fight against Soviet domination of the country.
	   He is not the only radical leader believed to have had bases in
Sudan.
	   There are reports that Sudan has also sheltered pro-Iranian
groups and Islamic militants fighting the secular regime of
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
	   Sudan has been on Washington's list of states sponsoring
terrorism since 1993.
	   The United States cut all but humanitarian aid to Sudan after
Brig. Omar Hassan el-Bashir ousted the country's civilian
government in 1989. Turabi is believed to be the power behind the
government.
	   However, the United States is one of the major donors to food
aid in southern Sudan, which is again facing another famine.
International relief agencies estimate some 1.5 million people are
threatened with starvation.
	   The 15-year civil war has helped sap the economy of a vast
nation _ it's about one-third the size of the continental United
States _ whose potential from the waters of the Nile River has
never been realized.
	   Sudan has an population estimated at 28 million. About 23
million people live in the predominantly Muslim north.

Life has certainly changed for Quigley
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM O'CONNELL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, New York (AP) _ Dana Quigley's life changed
dramatically one year ago and yet he's still doing what he loves to
do.
	   Within an hour of winning a three-hole playoff at the Northville
Long Island Classic for his first victory on the Senior PGA Tour,
Quigley found out his father had died that morning. A day of
professional joy was capped with personal devastation and only golf
has remained a constant.
	   ``I'm still pinching myself to find out if it's really true, if
it really happened,'' Quigley said Thursday, the day before opening
defense of his championship in the dlrs 1 million tournament at
Meadow Brook Club. ``I could never have imagined the feelings, the
success, the friendships, the whole package of what's happened to
me here since what happened last year. People say it was
bittersweet, but I just can't find anything bitter about it.
	   ``It has humbled me and I thought I was a humble guy, but I've
been able to touch so many people and so many people's lives.
That's what the tour is to me.''
	   It has also meant playing golf _ a lot of golf.
	   Since last year's Northville, the 52-year-old Quigley has played
in every event for which he has been eligible, 40 in a row.
	   ``Pro-ams, Tuesday shootouts, whatever. I love to play golf,''
he said. ``People tell me I should take a week off, but I would
just go home and play golf. I may as well stay out here and fill it
up while I'm able.''
	   Quigley is 13th on the money list this year but his 11 top-10
finishes rank fourth behind Hale Irwin, Dave Stockton and Gil
Morgan. Irwin and Morgan have dominated the tour this year and they
are not playing this week.
	   ``That means two spots in the top five are open for grabs,''
Quigley said. ``I don't ever see it as a threat when they are here.
There is plenty of money for everybody.''
	   While Quigley has earned dlrs 620,000 this year, more than six
times what he made in a nondescript PGA Tour career, it has been
the comments from the marshals, the respect of the other golfers
and the interaction with fans that have made his year as a
tournament champion special.
	   ``Two weeks ago, at the Burnet Senior Classic in Minnesota, I
was playing in the pro-am and it's pouring rain and about 45
degrees and I see this 14-year-old boy is following me,'' Quigley
said. ``It's 8 o'clock in the morning and only the third hole so I
asked him if he wanted to ride in the cart with me, that it would
keep him drier and warmer. He came inside the ropes and rode the
rest of the way as my unofficial caddy.
	   ``He told me absolutely everything about me and my game. This
was someone who I had never had contact with in my life ever
before. He told me he thought my win was the greatest and that he
now wanted to be a golfer. That kind of payback is what makes this
all worthwhile.''

Grains, soybeans retreat on disappointing exports, crop outlook
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Grain and soybean futures prices retreated
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid disappointment over
weekly export sales figures and expectations crops will improve
further under beneficial weather.
	   The U.S. Agriculture Department reported weekly wheat export
sales of 321,500 metric tons, a figure below expectations. Soybean
sales came in at a relatively weak 38,800 metric tons, at a time
when market participants have thought purchases to be on the rise.
	   Corn futures found support on a surprising export sales figure
of 713,500 metric tons for stored crops and 472,500 metric tons for
crops being delivered this fall, but prices retreated on the
falling wheat and soybean markets.
	   Grain and soybean futures also were pressured by forecasts for
timely rains and moderating temperatures next week after a
predicted weekend hot spell in Midwest growing regions.
	   Soybeans are on track for record production, while corn
production is expected to be the second-largest on record. Crop
tours of corn, wheat and soybean growing areas also were finding
relatively high yields, which could lead to even higher production
numbers than currently predicted.
	   Wheat for December delivery fell 2 1/4 cents to dlrs 2.72 1/4 a
bushel; December corn fell 1 3/4 cents to dlrs 2.18 a bushel;
December oats rose 2 3/4 cents to dlrs 1.16 1/4 a bushel; November
soybeans fell 5 1/2 cents to dlrs 5.37 1/2 a bushel.

Health failing, Suu Kyi offers to end protest if prisoners freed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with remarks from State Department spokesman, Grafs
12-14 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Her health worsening, Nobel laureate Aung
San Suu Kyi offered Thursday to end her roadside standoff with the
military regime if jailed members of her political party are freed.
	   Suu Kyi's health was ``failing'' nine days into the standoff,
but she was in ``high spirits,'' according to a statement released
by her National League for Democracy.
	   Her offer came on the eve of a deadline Suu Kyi has set for the
government to finally convene a parliament elected in 1990. Suu
Kyi's party won 82 percent of the seats in the assembly, but the
military refused to honor the results.
	   The statement quoted Suu Kyi's personal physicians, who have
visited her twice in her van about 20 miles (32 kilometers) outside
Yangon, as saying the whites of her eyes were turning yellow and
her blood pressure was low.
	   Doctors took blood samples, fearing she may have contracted
jaundice or another disease after spending nine days in the van
with three colleagues on a small country bridge.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, is in her fourth confrontation in two months with
the military government over her right to travel freely within
Myanmar, also known as Burma. She was stopped Aug. 12 as she
attempted to drive to the city of Bassein to meet fellow party
members.
	   Suu Kyi's party said the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner was
willing to return to Yangon if the government released members of
her party imprisoned since May.
	   There are 42 of her party members in Myanmar's prisons,
according to the All Burma Students Democratic Front, an exile
group. The number of party members arrested since May is unclear.
	   There was no immediate response from the government to Suu Kyi's
offer. In the past, they have ignored her calls to release
political prisoners or begin a dialogue.
	   The military said Thursday it has no intention of meeting Suu
Kyi's demand to convene parliament by Friday.
	   The military has ruled Myanmar since 1962. In 1988, the military
gunned down thousands of protesters during a nationwide uprising.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James B. Foley said
the U.S. government is ``deeply concerned by reports that Aung San
Suu Kyi's health is beginning to deteriorate.''
	   He said Suu Kyi should be allowed to travel freely within her
own country.
	   ``We call on the Burmese government to take all possible steps
to resolve this situation peacefully and quickly,'' Foley said,
``including releasing the three imprisoned National League for
Democracy representatives elected from Pathein in May 1990.''

Steinhauer hopes to ride momentum of Women's British Open win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAPLE GROVE, Minnesota (AP) _ Sherri Steinhauer's life has
changed dramatically in a week.
	   Last Friday, Steinhauer started round two of the Women's British
Open 10 strokes out of the lead after a first-day 81. It took 54
more holes, but she erased the deficit and claimed a one-stroke
victory in one of the most dramatic tournament turnarounds in
years. The win earned her a career-best payday of dlrs 160,000 and
ended a four-year victory drought.
	   On Friday, Steinhauer begins play in the dlrs 600,000 LPGA
Rainbow Classic. She's hoping to ride the momentum from last week
against a field of 139 in the 54-hole tournament at the Rush Creek
Golf Club in pursuit of the dlrs 90,000 champion's purse.
	   Steinhauer finished seventh in LPGA earnings in 1994, on the
strength of eight top-10 finishes, but she hasn't been a consistent
top-10 player since then. Prior to last week's victory, her last
tour top-three finish came at the Minnesota LPGA event in 1995 when
she placed third. She had only three top-eight finishes this year
before her British Open win.
	   ``Winning the British Open gives me a lot of confidence,''
Steinhauer said. ``It's been frustrating not having won since 1994.
It's a boost I needed now. I felt like I had played well in recent
years but just couldn't come out on top. I did wonder if I ever
would win again.''
	   Steinhauer played the final 54 holes last week in 5-under,
including an eight-foot (2 1/2-meter) birdie at No. 18 Sunday.
	   ``After shooting 81 on Thursday, I had no idea that winning was
even in the picture,'' Steinhauer said. ``I was just thinking about
making the cut.''
	   Steinhauer's victory made for an exciting but hectic week,
including a stop in her hometown of Madison, Wis., en route to the
Twin Cities for this tournament.
	   ``I'm going on adrenaline,'' Steinhauer said. ``It's been a hard
adjustment with the travel and the time change. We had a big party
with some LPGA officials Sunday night. I flew in to Chicago Monday
and drove to Madison, and had another big party with my family. I
saw my best friend from high school and spent some time with her
the next night. It's been fun but now it's time to get back to
golf.''
	   Only two of the LPGA top-10 money winners for 1998 are entered
in the tournament _ No. 7 Brandie Burton and No. 8 Meg Mallon.
	   Burton finished one stroke behind Steinhauer last week, and
three weeks ago won the du Maurier Classic, an LPGA major. Mallon
won the last LPGA event in the U.S., the Star Bank Classic two
weeks ago, her 10th top-seven finish of 1998.
	   Defending champion Danielle Ammaccapane also is entered. She was
fourth at the 1998 U.S Women's Open in July, won the Mercury
Titleholders event in May and is 17th on the 1998 money list. Last
year, Ammaccapane broke a five-year losing drought with a
one-stroke victory.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Sudan's information minister, Ghazi
Salah-Eddin, said Thursday that the U.S. attack on a pharmaceutical
plant in the Sudanese capital was ``a criminal act'' against the
country.
	   He also told state-run television that he believed U.S.
President Clinton acted to draw public attention from his
relationship with a former White House intern.
	   Salah-Eddin said two U.S. warplanes fired five missiles that
struck the Al-Shifa Pharmaceutical Factory at 7:15 p.m. (1715 gmt)
	   He did not indicate if the factory sustained any damage or if
there were casualties.
	   But the governor of Khartoum, Majthob al-Khalifa, told Sudanese
television that the factory was ``totally destroyed'' and that
several people working at the facility were injured.
	   He said fire engines had been sent to try to extinguish the
blaze and that several workers were unaccounted for and feared
trapped in the factory.
	   The broadcasts were monitored in Cairo.

Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, Clinton said.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said in Washington that the
factory in the North Khartoum area of the Sudanese capital had been
targeted as a suspected chemical weapons site.
	   Sudan's interior minister, Brig. Abdel-Raheem Mohammed Hussein,
told Cable News Network that this was untrue.
	   ``It is not chemical weapons. It is a factory for medical
drugs,'' he told CNN.
	   ``We have no chemical weapons factory in our country,'' he said.
``We have no chemical weapons factories at all.''
	   Salah-Eddin, too, denied the weapons allegation.
	   He described the attack, saying: ``At the beginning, they (the
jets) dropped a flare to light the site, then fired five missiles
that hit the factory, which is privately owned.''
	   He called it as ``a criminal and telling act'' because ``the
American government was not able to prove who carried out the
attacks on its embassies.''
	   Asked if he thought it was related to the American investigation
into Clinton's relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky, he said: ``I have no doubt about this.''
	   He suggested Clinton wanted ``to turn public attention'' away
from the affair.
	   Salah-Eddin said that the Sudanese leadership was meeting
Thursday night ``to study the measures it is going to take.''
	   This, he suggested, could include an international lawsuit
against Washington. He gave no other details.

Netanyahu: Israel supports the U.S. fight against terrorism
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with quotes from Netanyahu spokesman,
Palestinian reaction; adds byline &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday
welcomed the U.S. air strikes against targets in Afghanistan and
Sudan and said Israel stood by the United States in its fight
against terrorism.
	   There was no immediate reaction from Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat or officials in his government.
	   However, some Palestinian residents in the Gaza Strip denounced
the U.S. air strikes as Western aggression against Muslims.
	   The U.S. bombings raised immediate concerns in the Middle East
that Islamic militants would retaliate with more terror attacks.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said he ordered the air raids in
response to the bombings of two U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania earlier this month. Those bombings have been linked to an
Islamic militant leader, Osama Bin Laden, based in Afghanistan.
	   Netanyahu said in a statement Thursday that he supported the
U.S. fight against terrorism. ``The prime minister welcomes the
U.S. decision to strike targets of terrorists in Sudan and
Afghanistan,'' a statement by Netanyahu's office said.
	   It has long been Israel's policy to retaliate against terror
attacks and Israel has criticized Western countries in the past for
not doing enough to stand up to terrorists.
	   Netanyahu's senior aide, David Bar-Illan, said concern about
retaliation by Islamic militants should never be an issue. ``If we
allow the fear of retaliation to dictate our action or inaction, we
will have handed the terrorists the ultimate victory,'' he said.
	   Bar-Illan would not say whether Israel had assisted the United
States in any way in carrying out the air raids. ``In general,
Israel collaborates with any nation to fight terrorism,'' he said.
	   In Palestinian-ruled Gaza City, the mood was one of anger.
	   ``This is another American aggression against the Muslims,''
said Hussan Mustafa, 33, as he sat outside a mosque. ``This
requires a strong reaction from us as Muslims and Arabs. The Arabs
should not stand with their hands tied.''

	   Earlier, state-run television said that Sudan was ``subjected to
an aerial strike by unjust American warplanes that aimed at
strategic targets.''
	   The announcer ended the broadcast by saying ``Allah Akbar,'' the
rallying cry of Muslims meaning ``God is Great'' and added: ``We
will defend our country.''
	   Earlier this year, the American magazine U.S. News and World
Report quoted a secret congressional report as saying Iraq had
built chemical weapons plants in Sudan. This was never publicly
confirmed by U.S. officials.
	   Last December, a Sudanese opposition group charged in a
statement faxed to The Associated Press in Cairo that the Sudanese
government was making chemical weapons and using them in its war
against southern rebels.
	   The Eritrea-headquartered National Democratic Alliance charged
that the Sudanese government was producing chemical weapons at
factories at three sites: Kafourni neighborhood in the North
Khartoum section of the capital; the town of Mayo, south of the
capital, and Wau, a town some 1,000 kilometers (600 miles)
southwest of Khartoum.
	   The alliance groups opposition politicians and rebel factions
dedicated to ousting Sudan's leader, Lt. Gen. Omar el-Bashir, who
took power in a military coup in 1989 and installed an Islamic
regime.
	   Southern rebels have been fighting since 1983 for more autonomy
for the south's Christians and animists from the Islamic north.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The man the United States accuses of
directing the embassy bombings in Africa that killed 257 people is
safe after U.S. attacks on two of his bases Thursday, Afghanistan's
Taliban rulers said.
	   Osama ``bin Laden is safe and no damage has been done to any of
his companions,'' said Mullah Abdullah, a Taliban spokesman reached
at their headquarters in the southern city of Kandahar. He did not
say where bin Laden was, or whether he had been at any of the sites
attacked.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, speaking on television, said he
ordered U.S. military strikes after linking bin Laden's facilities
to the embassy bombings in Africa.
	   ``Today we have struck back,'' the president declared.
	   Bin Laden is a Saudi millionaire whom U.S. officials call a
major sponsor of terrorism. He has been vocal in his criticism of
the United States, calling on Muslims to attack U.S. interests
around the world.
	   Abdullah said the United States launched air attacks on Khost
150 kilometers (90 miles) south and on Jalalabad, 100 kilometers
(60 miles) east of Kabul, both near the border of Pakistan's
Northwest Frontier Province. He could not immediately say exactly
what weapons had been used or describe the extent of the damage.
	   Before the attacks Thursday, a government source in Pakistan,
speaking on condition of anonymity, had said Pakistani intelligence
agents knew bin Laden was to have addressed a religious meeting in
Khost Thursday.
	   The Afghan capital, Kabul, was quiet late Thursday. Word of the
U.S. attacks came near midnight, when most of the capital was
asleep.
	   A day before, the United States had warned non-Muslim foreign
aid workers to leave Afghanistan, saying they had learned of
``credible threats'' against them. The U.S. Embassy spokesman in
neighboring Pakistan had refused to elaborate on the threats.
	   Speculation about a possible U.S. attack had been fueled by the
warning to foreigners in Kabul, and by the evacuation a day earlier
of all but essential embassy staff in neighboring Pakistan. The
attacks could spark angry, potentially violent reaction in both
Afghanistan and Pakistan.
	   U.S. officials refused to say exactly how the attacks were
carried out. An air strike, as described by the Taliban spokesman,
would likely have meant flying over Pakistan.
	   Pakistani officials have said repeatedly in recent days that the
United States had not approached them about any attack on bin
Laden. Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz refused comment after
the attacks were announced, saying he had been awakened by a call
from The Associated Press.
	   Though the Pakistani government is a U.S. ally, a vocal minority
in the officially Islamic country paints the United States as an
enemy of Islam. The Pakistani government is likely to face domestic
political pressure if it is learned it facilitated an attack on bin
Laden.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Sudan's information minister, Ghazi
Salah-Eddin, said Thursday that the U.S. attack on a pharmaceutical
plant in the Sudanese capital was ``a criminal act'' against the
country.
	   He also told state-run television that he believed U.S.
President Clinton acted to draw public attention from his
relationship with a former White House intern.
	   Salah-Eddin said two U.S. warplanes fired five missiles that
struck the pharmaceutical factory at 7:15 p.m. (1715 gmt)
	   Shortly after he spoke, the television showed pictures of flames
shooting out of the roof of El-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co.
in the North Khartoum neighborhood of the Sudanese capital.
	   Some walls appeared to have collapsed, and twisted metal and
broken concrete were strewn around the complex. Men in surgical
masks were walking around the building, some of which appeared to
be intact.
	   The governor of Khartoum, Majthob al-Khalifa, told Sudanese
television that several people working at the facility were
injured.
	   He said fire engines had been sent to try to extinguish the
blaze and that some workers were unaccounted for and feared trapped
in the factory.
	   The broadcasts were monitored in Cairo.
	   Earlier, state-run Sudan Television broke into its regular
programs to announce the attack, which Clinton ordered in
retaliation for the bombings of American embassies in East Africa.
	   U.S. warplanes also struck suspected camps of Muslim militant
Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, Clinton said.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said in Washington that the

	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A choir singer, a beautician, a
Sunday school teacher, a charity worker, a shopkeeper, a farmer, a
cashier and a student. The final eight people slain in Northern
Ireland's deadliest attack were laid to rest Thursday in this
grief-seared town.
	   Methodist President David Kerr told the weeping parents of Julie
Hughes that there was ``no answer on this side of eternity'' why
their 21-year-old daughter and 27 others had to die Saturday in an
attack by Irish Republican Army dissidents.
	   Medical officials on Thursday raised the number of people
injured to more than 330, 78 of whom remained hospitalized, seven
in critical condition.
	   Police appealing for more information disclosed that two men
were seen walking away from the car packed with 500 pounds (225 kg)
of explosives 40 minutes before the blast.
	   But police also released three men arrested Monday from two
villages near Omagh on suspicion of involvement in the bombing. Two
others arrested the same day remained in custody at Belfast's
Castlereagh Interrogation Center, where under anti-terrorist law
they can be held for up to a week before being charged or freed.

By-election to test popularity of ruling party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ Little more than a year after its
massive landslide to power, the ruling St. Lucia Labour Party will
have its popularity tested in a by-election.
	   Kenneth John, member of Parliament from the Castries-Babonneau
district, died last month when he tried to rescue a swimmer off the
coast of the island. A special election will be held Friday to fill
his seat.
	   Though the by-election will have no effect on the balance of
power in the Parliament, it will be the first test of the Labour
party's popularity with voters since it won all but one of the 17
Parliamentary seats in a historic landslide in May 1997.
	   The 1997 win was the largest in the island nation's history and
a upset for the United Workers' Party, which had held power for all
but three years since St. Lucia gained independence from Britain in
1979.
	   John won election to the Parliament last year with a 1,300-vote
advantage in the district, which has 8,000 eligible voters.

New Spanish distance running king in Reyes Estevez
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; RECASTS with new quotes throughout; changes byline &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The reign of Spanish distance running
in Europe has a new king _ Reyes Estevez.
	   The 22-year-old Spaniard won a tactical 1,500 Thursday in the
European Championships, using a vicious kick over the last 200
meters to push Portugal's Rui Silva to silver and countryman and
Spanish national hero Fermin Cacho to bronze.
	   Reyes, finishing in 3 minutes 41.31 seconds, exploded to a 15
meter lead with his kick, then slowed 20 meters from the end and
wagged his right index finger to signal No. 1. He crossed the line
with his arms spread wide and relaxed as if to say ``that was
easy.''
	   ``I knew I had a good chance since I had the best European time
this year,'' said Reyes, a bronze medalist at 1,500 in the worlds a
year ago. ``This is the greatest moment in my life, and all the
more that I was able to beat a legend, my compatriot Fermin
Cacho.''
	   Silva clocked 3:41.84 and Cacho held on for third in 3:42.13.
	   Cacho, 29, has had an injury plagued year and could be nearing
the end after winning gold in the '92 Olympics and silver in the
last Olympics and worlds.
	   ``I was not in top shape,'' he said. ``I also had an injury
earlier in the season. The pace was too slow, which was bad for me.
But I must say, at this stage of my career bronze is nothing to be
ashamed of.''
	   Cacho began the Spanish distance running boom with his Barcelona
gold. In these championship, Spaniards were the defending champions
in three of the four distance races.
	   The 1,500 was one of seven medal events Thursday _ the third day
of six in the Euros _ and they went to seven different countries.
	   The best performance was probably in the women's shot put where
Vita Pavlish of Ukraine threw 21.69 meters, a championship record
and the best in the world this season. The throw was a
personal-best by 96 centimeters for the world silver medalist.
	   ``You might ask how I managed to beat the rest of the field by
roughly two meters,'' she said. ``This answer is simple: I am just
so strong.''
	   Estonia's Erki Nool earned the tiny Baltic country its first
European gold since 1938 when he rallied in the javelin and pole
vault _ the eighth and ninth events _ to win the decathlon with
8,667 points.
	   ``I cannot tell you how happy I am since this has been the first
Estonian gold in the Europeans since 1938,'' he said.
	   Poland's Pavel Januszewski surged ahead over the last hurdle to
beat favorite Ruslan Mashchenko of Russia _ the top European all

Lippi and Del Piero questioned in doping-investigation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with four grafs to UPDATE with Del Piero walking out of
news conference. Picks up 3rdd graf prvs, `The investigation ...' &QL; 
 &UR; With ROM110-111

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Juventus coach Marcello Lippi and star forward
Alessandro Del Piero were questioned Thursday by the anti-doping
commission of the Italian Olympic Committee looking into
allegations top players in Italy's first division soccer league
took performance-enhancing substances.
	   For Del Piero, it was the second such testimony. In a meeting
with a Turin prosecutor last week, he said his muscles are the
result of ``years of hard work.''
	   Del Piero walked out of a post-testimony news conference
Thursday when a reporter asked him, ``Do you feel doped?''
	   Immediately before, also in answer to a question, he assured
reporters that he ``knew perfectly the composition of all the
substances that I ingested.''
	   The investigation stems from an interview by AS Roma coach
Zdenek Zeman, who said he was amazed by the quick muscular
development of players including Gianluca Vialli and Del Piero.
	   Several players, team doctors and coaches have since been
questioned since Zeman's remarks.
	   Earlier Thursday, Brazilian soccer star Ronaldo, back in Milan
to join Inter after a monthlong vacation, said he is willing to
volunteer information to prosecutors.
	   ``If they want to know anything from me, I'll be glad to go''
see them, the AGI news agency quoted Ronaldo as saying.
	   ``Where I've played I've never heard anything like this,'' he
added. ``I don't know about other teams, though.''
	   Ronaldo has not been summoned, but there were speculations over
the last days that he could be questioned.
	   Testimony will continue in the next days with Italy's national
team captain Paolo Maldini, and Chelsea's Roberto Di Matteo and
Pierluigi Casiraghi, among others.

Graf loses at du Maurier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Steffi Graf, who dominated women's tennis before
injuries proved her downfall, was upset by Spain's Magui Serna 6-4,
6-4 Thursday in the third round of the dlrs 1.3-million du Maurier
Open.
	   Serna had a match point serving at 5-3 but Graf fought it off,
then won her own serve. Graf saved three more match points on
Serna's serve before losing after the game had gone to its third
deuce.
	   The end came after Graf hit a backhand just long and Serna fired
an ace down the middle.
	   Serna is ranked No. 26 in the world to No. 41 for Graf, who is
attempting a comeback from a knee injury.
	   Meanwhile, top-seeded Martina Hingis made a lot of errors, but
still beat Japan's Ai Sugiyama 6-3, 6-0 to reach the quarterfinals.
	   Second-seeded Jana Novotna and fifth-seeded Monica Seles also
reached the quarterfinals with straight-set victories.

Settler stabbed to death in Hebron
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ A 63-year-old rabbi was stabbed to
death, apparently by a Palestinian, in his home in a Jewish settler
compound in this tense West Bank city Thursday night, a settler
spokesman said.
	   There was concern that the killing would trigger new violence in
Hebron, a city of 130,000 Palestinians and 450 Jewish settlers.
	   David Wilder, a spokesman for the Hebron settlers, said the
assailant climbed through a window into Rabbi Shlomo Raanan's
bedroom in a mobile home in the Tel Romeida enclave in Hebron.
	   Raanan was getting ready for bed when he was stabbed in the
chest by the assailant who then threw a firebomb into the living
room where the rabbi's wife was staying, Wilder said.
	   The wounded rabbi tried to grab the assailant who stabbed Raanan
a second time before fleeing, Wilder said. As the mobile home
caught fire, the rabbi was pulled out of the flames by a paramedic,
but died of his injuries, Wilder said.
	   Israeli troops launched a search for the assailant.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Sudan's information minister, Ghazi
Salah-Eddin, said Thursday that the U.S. attack on a pharmaceutical
plant in the Sudanese capital was ``a criminal act'' against the
country.
	   He also told state-run television that he believed U.S.
President Clinton acted to draw public attention from his
relationship with a former White House intern.
	   Salah-Eddin said two U.S. warplanes fired five missiles that
struck the pharmaceutical factory at 7:15 p.m. (1715 gmt)
	   Shortly after he spoke, the television showed pictures of flames
shooting out of the roof of El-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co.
in the North Khartoum neighborhood of the Sudanese capital.
	   Some walls appeared to have collapsed, and twisted metal and
broken concrete were strewn around the complex. Men in surgical
masks were walking around the building, some of which appeared to
be intact.
	   About two dozen Sudanese men demonstrated outside the factory,
shouting ``Oh Clinton, you coward!''

Attacks in Kosovo as French warn of military action

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with French president, Serb confirmation
of fighting; quotes from U.S. envoy Christopher Hill &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police and ethnic Albanian
rebels clashed Thursday in southwestern Kosovo, and French
President Jacques Chirac told his Russian counterpart the United
Nations may need to order military intervention.
	   In an nearly hour-long telephone conversation between Paris and
Moscow, Chirac told Russian President Boris Yeltsin that unless a
cease-fire and new peace talks come soon, military intervention
ordered by the U.N. Security Council will become ``difficult to
avoid,'' a Chirac aid said.
	   Hundreds have already died since Serbs began a crackdown on
ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo in late February. The United
Nations estimates that more than 231,000 people have been uprooted
in the months since.
	   International officials have warned of a humanitarian
catastrophe this winter unless the violence stops and civilians can
return to their homes to harvest crops.
	   In Belgrade, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met with Nikola
Sainovic, the deputy prime minister of Yugoslavia, Thursday, to
discuss the need to create better conditions for the return of
displaced people.
	   ``We talked about the need to improve access for humanitarian
shipments and the fact that we need conditions to be created so
these people can come home,'' Hill told reporters at a news
conference. ``We are committed to improve those conditions as soon
as possible.''
	   Although the level of fighting has decreased since Serb forces
drove the Kosovo Liberation Army from key strongholds this month,
scattered clashes are continuing.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources said one KLA fighter was killed and
three were wounded, including an officer, in clashes which began
Wednesday night between the towns of Orahovac and Suva Reka, about
60 kilometers (37 miles) southwest of here.
	   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
heaviest fighting was around the villages of Zociste, Opterusa and
Samodraza. The Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said Serb
forces Thursday shelled the village of Pantina, about 28 kilometers
(17 miles) northwest of Pristina.
	   The Serbs' Media Center in Pristina reported ``groups of armed
Albanian extremists'' attacked police positions in Zociste with
automatic weapons and mortars, wounding one policeman.
	   State-run Tanjug news agency said there were clashes between
police and ``terrorists,'' meaning the KLA, in parts of the
province.
	   None of the reports could not be independently confirmed.
	   Under pressure from the United States and the Europeans, the
leading Albanian politician, Ibrahim Rugova, has named a panel to
begin talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on the
future of the province.
	   The Albanians are demanding independence from Serbia, the main
republic of Yugoslavia. Milosevic has offered autonomy, which the
Europeans and Americans support.
	   But the panel, which has been rejected by the KLA, has not begun
direct talks with the Serbs and has instead been working with U.S.
diplomats to develop a platform and negotiating strategy.
	   In Paris, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine expressed
disappointment at the slow pace of the process. ``We are looking
for ... the beginning of a negotiation, which still has not
started, for this autonomy,'' Vedrine told RTL radio.
	   Hill continued his shuttle diplomacy Thursday, traveling to
Pristina to meet with Rugova and the Albanian panel, Fehmi Agani
after his talks with Sainovic.
	   ``The negotiating process is moving ahead and is very active,''
Hill told reporters at a news conference. He acknowledged that
negotiations have so far been indirect, but argued that this
approach seemed to be working.
	   ``There may be a time when we need to bring the parties together
and when the time comes we'll certainly do that.''

Settler stabbed to death in Hebron

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with army confirmation; adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ A Palestinian broke into a heavily
guarded Jewish settler compound in this tense city Thursday night,
stabbed to death a 63-year-old rabbi and set the man's mobile home
on fire, the army and a settler spokesman said.
	   The victim's wife, who was in the mobile home during the attack,
was treated for smoke inhalation.
	   There was concern that the killing would trigger new violence in
Hebron, a city of 130,000 Palestinians and 450 Jewish settlers.
	   Israeli troops sealed off the area and conducted searches.
	   The army said the incident began when a Palestinian broke into a
home in the Jewish settler enclave of Tel Romeida in downtown
Hebron on Thursday evening. The army said the assailant struggled
with a Jewish settler in the home, stabbed and killed him and threw
a firebomb before fleeing.
	   David Wilder, a spokesman for the Jewish settlers in Hebron,
identified the victim as Rabbi Shlomo Raanan, 63.
	   Wilder said Raanan was getting ready for bed when he was stabbed
in the chest by the assailant who then threw a firebomb into the
living room where the rabbi's wife was staying.
	   The wounded rabbi tried to grab the assailant who stabbed Raanan
a second time before fleeing, Wilder said. As the mobile home
caught fire, the rabbi was pulled out of the flames by a paramedic,
but died of his injuries, Wilder said.
	   In response to the killing, Michael Kleiner, a hardline
legislator of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition,
demanded that the 1997 Hebron agreement be canceled.
	   Under the accord, Israeli troops withdrew from 80 percent of the
city and remained only in the downtown area to protect Jewish
settlers.

Swiss balloon adventurer finds new teammate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHATEAU D'OEX, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss pilot Bertrand Piccard
will make his third attempt to circle the globe in a balloon this
winter with a Concorde flight engineer, it was announced Thursday.
	   Last February, Piccard's Breitling Orbiter 2 balloon broke the
record for longest time spent in the air by a balloon, landing in
Myanmar after a flight lasting 9 days, 17 hours and 55 minutes.
	   Piccard plans another attempt at the round-the-world challenge
with Anthony Brown, who works as a flight engineer on supersonic
Concorde aircraft for British Airways, his team said in a
statement.
	   The Swiss pilot needed a new team member because Belgian pilot
Wim Verstraeten and British flight engineer Andy Elson, who took
part in February's flight, had to drop out due to other
commitments.
	   Brown, from England, owns a major balloon-flight company and has
taken part in various balloon competitions, the statement added.
	   Piccard, Brown and the team's flight director Alan Noble are
currently in China in an effort to obtain clearance for the
Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon to fly over the country.
	   The last balloon's round-the-world bid was abandoned after China
refused it entry, causing it to miss out on jet-stream winds needed
to speed it over the Pacific.
	   The new balloon is in the final phase of construction in
Bristol, England, Thursday's statement said.
	   Earlier this week, American balloonist Steve Fossett's latest
attempt at the elusive global record ended when a storm damaged his
balloon, sending it plunging into the sea off Australia.
	   He had broken his own distance record, traveling more than
24,461 kilometers (15,200 miles). But Piccard's team retained the
flight duration record.

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Juan Adolfo Rieckehoff Gonzalez,
son of the late Puerto Rican Olympic official German Rieckehoff
Sampayo, returned from the Dominican Republic to turn himself in to
police Thursday.
	   Rieckehoff, 42, was sought by authorities in Puerto Rico on
charges that he had swindled several people in the San Juan area by
selling them properties he did not own and then disappearing with
the money.
	   Rieckehoff has been in the Dominican Republic for several weeks,
but made contact with police Wednesday through his lawyer and
decided to turn himself in.
	   Interpol agents escorted him to Puerto Rico after he was
detained by Dominican immigration officials for not having a
passport.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The man Washington accuses of
directing embassy bombings in Africa that killed 257 people is safe
after U.S. attacks on two of his bases Thursday, Afghanistan's
Taliban rulers said.
	   Osama ``bin Laden is safe and no damage has been done to any of
his companions,'' said Mullah Abdullah, a Taliban spokesman reached
at their headquarters in the southern city of Kandahar. He did not
say where bin Laden was, or whether he had been at any of the sites
attacked.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, speaking on television, said he
ordered U.S. military strikes after linking bin Laden to the
embassy bombings in Africa.
	   ``Today we have struck back,'' the president declared.
	   Bin Laden is a Saudi millionaire whom U.S. officials call a
major sponsor of terrorism. He has been vocal in his criticism of
the United States, calling on Muslims to attack U.S. interests
around the world.
	   Abdullah said the United States launched air attacks on Khost
150 kilometers (90 miles) south of the capital, Kabul, and on
Jalalabad, 100 kilometers (60 miles) east. Both are near the border
of Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province.
	   He could not immediately say exactly what weapons had been used
or describe the extent of the damage.
	   Before Thursday's attacks, a government source in Pakistan,
speaking on condition of anonymity, had said Pakistani intelligence
agents knew bin Laden was to have addressed a religious meeting
Thursday in Khost.
	   The Afghan capital, Kabul, was quiet late Thursday. Word of the
U.S. attacks came near midnight, when most of the capital was
asleep.
	   A day before, the United States had warned non-Muslim foreign
aid workers to leave Afghanistan, saying they had learned of
``credible threats'' against them. The U.S. Embassy spokesman in
neighboring Pakistan had refused to elaborate on the threats. Only
a few foreigners from the United Nations and independent aid
agencies were known to have left.
	   Speculation about a possible U.S. attack had been fueled by the
warning to foreigners in Kabul, and by the evacuation a day earlier
of all but essential embassy staff in neighboring Pakistan. The
attacks could spark angry, potentially violent reaction in both
Afghanistan and Pakistan.
	   U.S. officials refused to say exactly how the attacks were
carried out.
	   A Pakistani defense official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Pakistan had no warning of the attack and had not
given its consent for U.S. warplanes to fly across its territory.
The official said 16 U.S. aircraft, including F15s and F11s, flew
across Pakistan at 40,000 feet (12,000 meters) late Thursday from
an unknown base.
	   Pakistani officials have said repeatedly in recent days that the
United States had not approached them about attacking bin Laden.
Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz refused comment after the
attacks were announced, saying only that he had been awakened by a
call from The Associated Press. Foreign Ministry spokesman Tariq
Altaf was quoted by state-run Associated Press of Pakistan as
saying his government was monitoring the situation.
	   Though the Pakistani government is a U.S. ally, a vocal minority
in the officially Islamic country paints the United States as an
enemy of Islam. The Pakistani government is likely to face domestic
political pressure if it is learned it facilitated an attack on bin
Laden.

Depression becomes Tropical Storm Bonnie
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES THROUGHOUT with upgrade to tropical storm status,
details, quotes. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ A tropical depression moving toward the Caribbean
became Tropical Storm Bonnie on Thursday afternoon, and forecasters
expected it to reach hurricane status by the weekend.
	   ``We have the system going to hurricane strength by 48 hours,
and by 72 hours we have the system up to about 85 mph (136 kph) ,''
said John Guiney, hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane
Center.
	   At 5 p.m. EDT, Bonnie was centered near 17.8 north latitude,
60.7 west longitude, about 75 miles east of the northern Leeward
Islands of the eastern Caribbean. The storm was headed
west-northwest near 25 mph (40 kph) with top winds of 50 mph (80
kph).
	   Forecasters expected Bonnie to hold that course and slow
somewhat. Tropical storm force winds extended 115 miles from the
storm's center.
	   A tropical storm warning was issued Thursday evening for the
U.S. and British Virgin Islands. A tropical storm watch remained in
effect for the northern Leeward Islands of Antigua, Barbuda,
Anguilla, St. Maarten, Saba, St. Eustatius and Puerto Rico.
	   By Thursday evening, Bonnie's rainbands and gusty winds were
spreading over the Leeward Islands as well as the British and U.S.
Virgin Islands.
	   Tropical systems become named storms when their top sustained
winds reach 39 mph (62 kph). The hurricane threshold is 74 mph (118
kph).
	   The Atlantic hurricane season began in June and ends in
November.
	   The season's first, Tropical Storm Alex, fizzled out before it
reached the Caribbean earlier this month.

Netanyahu: Israel supports the U.S. fight against terrorism
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction by Hamas leader, Israel TV report
raising the possibility that Israel assisted the U.S. in planning
the air strikes &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday
welcomed the U.S. air strikes in Afghanistan and Sudan and said
Israel stood by the United States in its fight against terrorism.
	   There was no immediate reaction from Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat or officials in his government.
	   The leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas, Sheik Ahmed
Yassin, said that while he condemned the air strikes as an
aggression against all Arabs and Muslims, his followers would not
engage in retaliatory attacks against U.S. targets.
	   ``Our battle is in Palestine and we will not take it elsewhere
because it does not serve our cause or our people,'' Yassin told
The Associated Press. Hamas has carried out more than a dozen
suicide bombings in Israel since 1994.
	   Still, the U.S. bombings raised immediate concerns in the Middle
East that Islamic militants would retaliate with more terror
attacks.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said he ordered the air raids in
response to the bombings of two U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania earlier this month. Those bombings have been linked to an
Islamic militant leader, Osama Bin Laden, based in Afghanistan.
	   Netanyahu said in a statement Thursday that he supported the
U.S. fight against terrorism. ``The prime minister welcomes the
U.S. decision to strike targets of terrorists in Sudan and
Afghanistan,'' a statement by Netanyahu's office said.
	   It has long been Israel's policy to retaliate against terror
attacks and Israel has criticized Western countries in the past for
not doing enough to stand up to terrorists.
	   Netanyahu's senior aide, David Bar-Illan, said concern about
retaliation by Islamic militants should never be an issue. ``If we
low the fear of retaliation to dictate our action or inaction, we
will have handed the terrorists the ultimate victory,'' he said.
	   Israel TV's Channel Two said Thursday it could not be ruled out
that Israeli and U.S. intelligence services cooperated in selecting
the targets and gathering information about them.
	   Channel Two's political reporter, Emanuel Rosen, said Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai spoke by phone last week to U.S.
Defense Secretary William Cohen and that the two discussed the need
to attack bases of terrorists.
	   Bar-Illan would not say whether Israel had assisted the United
States in any way in planning the air raids. ``In general, Israel
collaborates with any nation to fight terrorism,'' he said.
	   In Palestinian-ruled Gaza City, the mood was one of anger.
	   ``This is another American aggression against the Muslims,''
said Hussan Mustafa, 33, as he sat outside a mosque. ``This
requires a strong reaction from us as Muslims and Arabs. The Arabs
should not stand with their hands tied.''

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ A Palestinian broke into a heavily
guarded Jewish settler compound in this tense city Thursday night,
stabbed to death a 63-year-old rabbi in a struggle and set the
man's mobile home on fire, the army and a settler spokesman said.
	   The victim's wife, who was in the mobile home during the attack,
was treated for smoke inhalation.
	   There was concern that the killing would trigger new violence in
Hebron, a city of 130,000 Palestinians and 450 Jewish settlers.
	   Just hours after the killing, two Palestinians passing by a
settler enclave were kicked and beaten by a group of settlers. The
two men were treated for bruises at a Hebron hospital.

FDA approves radical treatment for chest pain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURAN NEERGAARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved
a radical and controversial treatment for crippling chest pain
Thursday: a laser that zaps up to 40 tiny holes into the heart
itself.
	   The heart laser is only for the small proportion of heart
patients who have a debilitating type of chest pain called stable
angina that is not helped by conventional therapy, the FDA
stressed. That's because the laser could cause dangerous reactions,
including irregular heartbeats, heart attacks, even death, the
agency warned.
	   But in the right patients, the laser made a big difference,
providing dramatic pain relief to most patients, the FDA
acknowledged.
	   ``Although we don't understand why it works, it's clear that it
works,'' said Dr. Susan Alpert, the FDA's medical device evaluation
chief. ``Some of these patients were essentially bedridden, ... and
they were able to get up and go.''
	   The procedure is called transmyocardial revascularization, or
TMR. In a two-hour operation, doctors slice a 4-inch
(10-centimeter) cut between the ribs, insert a small laser and
blast tiny _ 1 millimeter _ holes into the heart muscle.
	   The outer heart layers heal almost immediately, but the beating
heart is supposed to force the channels to stay open in the
interior.
	   The theory is that pain is relieved by increasing blood flow to
muscle areas that have been severely damaged by advanced heart
disease.
	   But several studies, in animals and a handful of human
autopsies, have shown the holes almost completely reclosed. That
prompted critics to question if the therapy really worked or was a
placebo effect in which the thought of helpful surgery can make
patients feel better.
	   Last year, the FDA's independent scientific advisers rejected
the laser's approval, citing problems with studies by PLC, the
company that makes the laser. So the FDA asked PLC to study whether
patients' pain relief lasted a year after laser treatment. If so,
that would rule out a placebo effect.
	   For 72 percent of the 61 patients tracked for a year, the relief
lasted, compared with just 13 percent of similarly severe angina
patients who found relief from conventional medicine.
	   The dlrs 400,000 laser did not prolong patients' lives, the FDA
said.
	   But the pain relief was dramatic, and significantly improved
their quality of life. So the FDA approved the laser.
	   Medication or heart bypass can significantly help most angina
cases.
	   The laser is intended for patients in severe pain who have
failed those therapies. And it's only for a type of pain called
stable angina. The laser is too dangerous for patients with
unstable angina, the FDA said _ 22 percent of those patients in the
clinical trials died after laser surgery, vs. just 1 percent of
stable angina patients.
	   But the FDA warned that the laser also poses a risk of heart
attack, irregular heartbeat and stroke. Another risk is that laser
could accidentally fire into the heart valves.
	   The laser is safe when used by a properly trained surgeon on the
right patient, said Dr. Robert March of Rush-Presbyterian-St.
Luke's Medical Center in Chicago, who has treated 85 patients and
who will train other surgeons for PLC. ``If you select the right
patient, then you should expect really a very low operative risk.''
	   The FDA said that before surgery, patients must sign a form
saying they read a special brochure about the laser and understood
the risks.
	   Franklin, Massachusetts-based PLC estimates the operation will
cost about as much as heart bypass, which can range from dlrs
20,000 to dlrs 40,000.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Sudan's information minister, Ghazi
Salah-Eddin, said Thursday that the U.S. attack on a pharmaceutical
plant in the Sudanese capital was ``a criminal act'' against the
country.
	   He also told state-run television that he believed U.S.
President Clinton acted to draw public attention from his
relationship with a former White House intern.
	   Salah-Eddin said two U.S. warplanes fired five missiles that
struck the pharmaceutical factory at 7:15 p.m. (1715 gmt)
	   The television said that seven Sudanese were being treated at
Khartoum Hospital for injuries suffered in the attack, including
one with a severe head injury.
	   The television showed pictures of flames shooting out of the
roof of El-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co. in the North
Khartoum neighborhood of the Sudanese capital.
	   Some walls appeared to have collapsed, and twisted metal and
broken concrete were strewn around the complex. Men in surgical
masks were walking around the building, some of which appeared to
be intact.
	   About two dozen Sudanese men demonstrated outside the factory,
shouting ``Oh Clinton, you coward!''

	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ Wimbledon champ Pete Sampras lost
6-3, 6-4 to qualifier Leander Paes and Frenchman Guillaume Raoux
ousted U.S. Open defending champ Patrick Rafter 7-6 (10-8), 6-3,
removing the two highest seeds in the Pilot Pen International on
Thursday.
	   Rafter beat Sampras in the Cincinnati tournament final Sunday,
and four days later both men said they were ready for a break.
	   ``I felt very flat. Playing three weeks in a row has taken its
toll emotionally. You can't afford to be flat in this league,''
said Sampras, who plans to return home to Orlando, Florida to
recharge for the U.S. Open.
	   ``Losing before the Slams is not as bad as losing in the Slam,''
Sampras said.
	   Rafter, whose loss snapped a career-high 11-match winning
streak, including victories in his last two tournaments, said he
also felt drained.
	   ``You can lose to anyone, any given day,'' said Rafter, the
tournament's No. 2 seed and the third-ranked player in the world.
	   The losses will help Chile's Marcel Rios hold onto his No. 1
world ranking if he makes it to the semifinals this week in
Indianapolis. If he does not, Sampras returns to the top spot from
hisl over the court, and used his
quick feet to play a dominating serve-and-volley game. Paes also
out-aced Sampras 7-4.
	   Raoux, the tournament's No. 16 seed, is ranked 48th in the
world. He used a strong baseline game, consistently passing Rafter
at the net, and effectively stopped Rafter from volleying sharply.
	   ``He was really too good for me today,'' said Rafter, who
dropped a 4-1 lead in the tiebreaker. ``There was no way to really
penetrate him.''
	   Raoux said Rafter seemed focused on defending his U.S. Open
title.
	   ``My coach said, `He has to take a break before the U.S. Open,
why not today?''' he said.
	   Defending Pilot Pen champ Yevgeny Kafelnikov beat Gustavo
Kuerten 6-4, 6-4, in part by avoiding the Brazilian's powerful
backhand.
	   Kafelnikov had won the French Open in 1996, and lost last year
to Kuerten in Paris when he took away the clay court title.
	   ``I'm glad I'm still on a roll, we'll see what happens,''
Kafelnikov said.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Glenallen Hill, pinch-hitting for pitcher Kevin
Tapani, hit a grand slam home run Thursday as the Chicago Cubs beat
the San Francisco Giants 7-3.
	   It was Hill's third home run of the year and the fifth grand
slam of his career. The victory puts the Cubs, who came into the
game trailing the New York Mets by a game in the NL wild card race,
three games ahead of San Francisco in the race.
	   Tapani (15-7) gave up four hits and three runs _ including two
homers _ in five innings. He also struck out five and walked three.
The Cubs shelled Russ Ortiz (1-3) for seven hits and five runs over
4 2-3 innings. He also walked four and struck out five.
	   Sammy Sosa was quiet a day after hitting his 48th home run,
going 0-for-5 at the plate. He struck out three times.

FDA asked to examine safety of Viagra for some patients
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL RECER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Charging that the impotence drug Viagra was
``dangerously rushed'' to market, a consumer group asked federal
regulators to reexamine the risks posed by the drug to certain
patients.
	   Dr. Sydney M. Wolfe of the Public Citizen's Health Research
Group said Thursday the instructions for using Viagra fail to
adequately warn about the possible effects of the drug on patients
who have certain heart or cardiovascular conditions.
	   ``Viagra affects blood vessels in many parts of the body,'' said
Wolfe. ``These effects are very worrisome.''
	   He petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to immediately
convene an advisory committee to consider the risks associated with
Viagra. There have been at least 39 deaths among American Viagra
drug users, but the cause of death is not known for 13 patients,
and key medical information is missing for some others.
	   Brad Stone, a spokesman for the FDA, said that the agency would
consider the proposal submitted by Wolfe, but added, ``With the
data now available, we still believe that Viagra is safe when used
according to the labeling.''
	   Pfizer Inc., the New York maker of Viagra, said in a statement
that the drug ``is safe and effective when used'' properly. The
company said 3.5 million prescriptions, or 30 million tablets, have
been dispensed in the four months since the drug was approved.
	   Wolfe said Viagra was approved as part of a ``dangerously
rushed'' process that carried the drug from submission to FDA
approval in just six months and without consideration by an FDA
advisory panel.
	   The FDA-required labeling warns that Viagra should not be used
by heart patients who are taking nitroglycerin or other nitrate
drugs. The combination can cause a sudden, and possibly lethal,
drop in blood pressure.
	   But Wolfe said ``we have concerns for three groups of patients
who are not included in the label warnings.'' The American College
of Cardiology and the American Heart Association on Aug. 10 also
cautioned doctors to be careful about prescribing Viagra for these
patient groups.
	   The three groups are patients with:
	   _Reduced blood flow to the heart, but who are not being treated
with nitrates. If such patients take Viagra and then experience a
heart attack, treatment with nitrates could be lethal.
	   _Congestive heart failure and low normal blood pressure.
	   _High blood pressure being treated with a complex variety of
drugs.
	   The Viagra instructions also warn about possible side effects
among patients who are taking two drugs, erythromycin or
cimetidine, or who have liver or kidney disease. All of these can
cause Viagra to stay in the body longer.
	   Dr. Adolph M. Hutter Jr. of the Massachusetts General Hospital,
chairman of an American College of Cardiology panel, said that it
is clear that ``the combination nitrates and Viagra is deadly'',
but it has been less widely known that other heart conditions can
be affected by Viagra.
	   ``It can be dangerous for some patients to take Viagra even if
they are not on nitrates,'' he said.
	   Hutter said that the ACC is not calling on the FDA to make
changes in its approval of Viagra, but that doctors ``need to
exercise caution'' in prescribing the drug for patients in those
three groups.
	   ``We felt the current regulation of Viagra by the FDA is
adequate for the data that has accumulated,'' said Hutter.

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ One by one, the masterminds slipped
out of Africa, leaving behind a plan, bombs and hired agents to
carry out attacks on U.S. Embassies that killed 257 people, a
suspect arrested in Pakistan was quoted Thursday as saying.
	   According to a senior Pakistani official, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh
told Pakistani interrogators he was among seven chief conspirators
who left Kenya before the explosion, arriving in Pakistan on
separate flights between Aug. 5 and Aug. 7. Kenyans and Tanzanians
hired to carry out the Aug. 7 bombings remained in Nairobi, Kenya
and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, Odeh said.
	   Odeh was arrested in Pakistan after arriving on a flight from
Nairobi on Aug. 7, the day of the bombings. Immigration officials
who noticed he did not match his Yemeni passport photograph stopped
him at Pakistan's Karachi airport, and he was questioned.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Pakistani investigators questioned Odeh for several days before he
revealed his role in the bombing. By then, any accomplices would
probably have already managed to slip into Afghanistan, where Odeh
said he had been headed, said the official, who was present at the
interrogation. Odeh was handed over to U.S. and Kenyan
investigators in Nairobi Aug. 14.
	   He told investigators in Pakistan he designed the explosives
used only in the Dar es Salaam attack.
	   But the Daily Nation, a Kenyan newspaper, has reported a bomb
containing 1,760 pounds (800 kilos) of TNT was assembled over
several days at a Nairobi hotel under Odeh's direction.
	   Kenyan police said last week they were holding ``about five
people'' in their investigation. Two suspects have been detained in
Tanzania. Their names and nationalities have not been released.
	   Odeh told Pakistani investigators the attacks were planned
starting in July under the direction of a man he called Ali Saleh
and identified as a member of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad group, the
official said.
	   Peter Mbuvi of the Kenyan police said Thursday investigators
there had not heard Saleh's name. Police officials in the Egyptian
capital said the name Ali Saleh was not known to them.
	   The government source, who insisted on anonymity, said Saleh was
an Egyptian and a close associate of Osama Bin Laden, a Saudi
millionaire living in Afghanistan who has urged Muslims to attack
U.S. installations. Saleh led Bin Laden's terrorist group in
Africa, the source said.
	   Before the bombings, a group known as the Islamic Jihad,
considered the successor to the groups that assassinated Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat in 1981, reportedly vowed to strike America
interests because some of its members were arrested in Albania.
	   Odeh's confession clearly links Bin Laden to the bomb attacks,
the Pakistani source said.
	   The alleged involvement of Bin Laden has provoked intense
speculation in Pakistan that Washington is planning to seize the
world's most wanted terrorist from Afghanistan. The swift
evacuation of American embassy personnel from Pakistan earlier this
weak further fueled speculation.
	   But Pakistani journalist Rahimullah Yusufzai, who was called by
a bin Laden spokesman Thursday evening before the bombing, quoted
bin Laden as saying: ``I have nothing to do with the bombing of
American embassies in Africa, but I urge the Muslims all over the
world to continue their jihad against the Americans and Jews.''
	   Yusufzai reports for the Pakistani national newspaper The News
and is known for his contacts with the Taliban, which governs most
of Afghanistan.
	   It was not known from where the spokesman was calling, and it
was not known where he was during or after the strikes.
	   Son of Palestinian parents, Odeh was born in Tabuk, Saudi
Arabia, in March 1965, according to his confession. He joined the
Palestinian Liberation Organization while studying in Jordan. He
acquired a diploma in architecture from the Philippines.
	   Odeh went to Afghanistan in 1990 to fight alongside Afghan
Muslims against a communist government. While in Afghanistan he met
bin Laden, a legendary figure among the Arabs who had come to join
the Afghan struggle.
	   After the fall of Afghanistan's communist government in 1992,
Odeh said bin Laden sent him to Kenya in 1994 to attack U.S.
interests in Africa.

FDA approves radical treatment for chest pain

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved
a radical and controversial treatment for crippling chest pain
Thursday: a laser that zaps up to 40 tiny holes into the heart
itself.
	   The heart laser is only for the small proportion of heart
patients who have a debilitating type of chest pain called stable
angina that is not helped by conventional therapy, the FDA
stressed. That's because the laser could cause dangerous reactions,
including irregular heartbeats, heart attacks, even death, the
agency warned.
	   But in the right patients, the laser made a big difference,
providing dramatic pain relief to most patients, the FDA
acknowledged.
	   ``Although we don't understand why it works, it's clear that it
works,'' said Dr. Susan Alpert, the FDA's medical device evaluation
chief. ``Some of these patients were essentially bedridden, ... and
they were able to get up and go.''
	   The procedure is called transmyocardial revascularization, or
TMR. In a two-hour operation, doctors slice a 4-inch
(10-centimeter) cut between the ribs, insert a small laser and
blast tiny _ 1 millimeter _ holes into the heart muscle.
	   The outer heart layers heal almost immediately, but the beating
heart is supposed to force the channels to stay open in the
interior.
	   The theory is that pain is relieved by increasing blood flow to
muscle areas that have been severely damaged by advanced heart
disease.
	   But several studies, in animals and a handful of human
autopsies, have shown the holes almost completely reclosed. That
prompted critics to question if the therapy really worked or was a
placebo effect in which the thought of helpful surgery can make
patients feel better.
	   Last year, the FDA's independent scientific advisers rejected
the laser's approval, citing problems with the studies by the
manufacturer, PLC Medical Systems. So the FDA asked PLC to study
whether patients' pain relief lasted a year after laser treatment.
If so, that would rule out a placebo effect.

Grenade explodes at site of protest of opposition figure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Sam Rainsy unharmed, witness
accounts.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A grenade exploded Thursday night in
front of Cambodia's Interior Ministry, where a prominent opposition
politician was participating in a sleep-in against alleged election
irregularities.
	   A driver for Kyodo News Service of Japan was killed in the
attack, said Deputy Commisioner of the Phnom Penh Municipal Police,
Yet Razaque.
	   Opposition politician Sam Rainsy was unhurt but was detained by
police at gunpoint for several hours in the ministry compound,
which authorities sealed off after the explosion.
	   ``Each minute felt like an hour,'' a shaken Sam Rainsy told
reporters after his release early Friday. He said police repeatedly
threatened to kill him and his supporters during their detention.
	   ``I thought that was it,'' he said.
	   Sam Rainsy had announced he would spend Thursday night in the
compound outside the office of the National Election Committee to
publicize his complaints of fraud in last month's election won by
strongman Hun Sen.
	   About 15 minutes before the attack, Sam Rainsy had stepped
outside the ministry gate to speak with Japanese journalists, but
went back inside and was apparently several hundred yards away when
the grenade exploded.
	   Witnesses said a grenade was tossed from a white car on the road
in front of the ministry and several shots were fired. The
assailants escaped.
	   ``Definitely they wanted to kill me,'' said Sam Rainsy, who
alleged that the attackers probably had strong links to the
Interior Ministry and may have wanted to send a signal to anyone
challenging the election results.
	   Sam Rainsy was the apparent target of a grenade attack last
March during a demonstration outside parliament. Sixteen people
were killed and more than 100 wounded in the attack, for which no
one was ever arrested. Sam Rainsy said at the time that he
suspected Hun Sen was behind the attack.
	   A reporter for Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper, Michiharu
Honda, who had been with Sam Rainsy, said that after Thursday's
attack, ministry guards pointed guns at the opposition politician
and made everyone raise their hands above their heads.
	   Sam Rainsy and his entourage were taken away, some of them being
manhandled, Honda said. The group was reportedly held in a cell and
questioned about why they had entered the ministry compound when it
was closed.
	   Other guards kept their guns trained on the 14 journalists
present, and a tense situation was defused only when the Japanese
ambassador contacted Interior Minister Sar Kheng.
	   Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party won a slight majority
in the July 26 election, but the main opposition parties have
threatened to boycott the new parliament and block the formation of
a government unless their claims of fraud are investigated.

Sudanese take over U.S. Embassy in Khartoum after attack
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By BASSEM MROUE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Angry Sudanese took over the empty U.S.
Embassy building in Khartoum early Friday morning after U.S. jets
attacked a pharmaceutical plant in the Sudanese capital.
	   State-run Sudan Television showed scores of people scaling the
wrought-iron fence around the embassy in the heart of the capital.
	   Hundreds more outside the fence threw stones at the building to
express their anger or struck at the fence with sticks.
	   They shouted ``Allahu Akbar,'' the Muslim rally cry meaning
``God is Great,'' and ``Down, Down USA'' in English.
	   Protesters who got inside the compound could be seen pulling
down the American flag and dragging it on the ground.
	   Police could be seen on the street in front of the building but
did not stop the mob from attacking building. There was no footage
to indicate if the crowd remained in compound or was dispersed by
police.
	   The State Department ordered local staff to leave the the
embassy after the Aug. 7 bombings of embassies in Nairobi, Kenya,
and Dar es-Salaam.
	   American diplomats were pulled out of Khartoum in 1996 after the
State Department said it could no longer guarantee their security.
Diplomats stationed in Cairo and in Nairobi visit Khartoum
periodically for consular services.
	   Earlier, Sudan's information minister, Ghazi Salah-Eddin, said
Thursday's attack on the pharmaceutical plant was ``a criminal
act'' against the country.
	   He also told state-run television that he believed U.S.
President Clinton acted to draw public attention from his
relationship with a former White House intern. The broadcasts were
monitored in Cairo.
	   Salah-Eddin said two U.S. warplanes fired five missiles that
struck the pharmaceutical factory at 7:15 p.m. (1715 gmt)
	   The television said that seven Sudanese were being treated at
Khartoum Hospital for injuries suffered in the attack, including
one with a severe head injury.
	   The governor of Khartoum, Majthob al-Khalifa, told Sudanese
television that some workers were unaccounted for and feared
trapped in the factory.
	   The television showed pictures of flames shooting out of the
roof of El-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co. in the North
Khartoum neighborhood of the Sudanese capital.
	   Some walls appeared to have collapsed, and twisted metal and
broken concrete were strewn around the complex. Men in surgical
masks were walking around the building, some of which appeared to
be intact.
	   Clinton ordered the attack in retaliation for the bombings of
the American embassies in East Africa.
	   U.S. warplanes also struck suspected camps of Muslim militant
Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, Clinton said.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said in Washington that the
factory in the North Khartoum area of the Sudanese capital had been
targeted as a suspected chemical weapons site.
	   Sudan's interior minister, Brig. Abdel-Raheem Mohammed Hussein,
told Cable News Network that this was untrue.
	   ``It is not chemical weapons. It is a factory for medical
drugs,'' he told CNN. ``We have no chemical weapons factories at
all.''
	   Salah-Eddin, too, denied the weapons allegation.
	   He described the attack, saying: ``At the beginning, they (the
jets) dropped a flare to light the site, then fired five missiles
that hit the factory, which is privately owned.''
	   He called it as ``a criminal and telling act'' because ``the
American government was not able to prove who carried out the
attacks on its embassies.''
	   Asked if he thought it was related to the American investigation
into Clinton's relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky, he said: ``I have no doubt about this.''
	   He suggested Clinton wanted ``to turn public attention'' away
from the affair.
	   Earlier this year, the American magazine U.S. News and World
Report quoted a secret congressional report as saying Iraq had
built chemical weapons plants in Sudan. This was never publicly
confirmed by U.S. officials.
	   Last December, a Sudanese opposition group charged in a
statement faxed to The Associated Press in Cairo that the Sudanese
government was making chemical weapons and using them in its war
against southern rebels.
	   The Eritrea-headquartered National Democratic Alliance charged
that the Sudanese government was producing chemical weapons at
factories at three sites: Kafourni neighborhood in the North
Khartoum section of the capital; the town of Mayo, south of the
capital, and Wau, a town some 1,000 kilometers (600 miles)
southwest of Khartoum.
	   The alliance groups opposition politicians and rebel factions
dedicated to ousting Sudan's leader, Lt. Gen. Omar el-Bashir, who
took power in a military coup in 1989 and installed an Islamic
regime.
	   Southern rebels have been fighting since 1983 for more autonomy
for the south's Christians and animists from the Islamic north.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of
7.1 shook the Ogasawara islands south of Tokyo on Thursday, but
there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.
	   The quake, which struck at 3:42 p.m. (0642GMT), was centered a
deep 410 kilometers (246 miles) under the seabed off Torishima
island, roughly 600 kilometers (360 miles) south of Tokyo, the
Meteorological Agency said.
	   Takashi Kameyama, an official with the Ogasawara islands public
office, said the quake was strong enough to rattle windows at his
office in Chichijima, 300 kilometers (180 miles) south of Torishima
island.
	   The Meteorological Agency said there was no fear of tsunami _
undersea waves triggered by volcanic activity or earthquakes.
	   The quake was felt in Tokyo and caused some buildings to sway.
	   A quake of magnitude 7 is considered major and is capable of
causing widespread, heavy damage.
	   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations as it
sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across the
earth's surface.

ambassador's reaction &QL;

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Sudan's U.N. ambassador said Thursday he
would lodge a formal complaint with the Security Council following
U.S. strikes on what he said was a ``very small, humble''
pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum.
	   Ambassador Elfatih Erwa disputed U.S. claims that the plant was
a chemical weapons plant used by terrorist organizations backed by
Osama bin Laden, whom the United States accuses in the twin embassy
bombings in east Africa.
	   ``We are going to act within the civilized international law,''
he said. ``We are intending to file a complaint to the Security
Council because we think that we are under aggression for no
reason. There is no justification.''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton on Thursday announced that the
United States attacked a terrorist base in Afghanistan and a
chemical weapons facility in Sudan _ 13 days after bombings of the
embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killed
257 people and injured more than 5,000.
	   Ravan A.G. Farhadi, the U.N. ambassador for the ousted Afghan
government, said the United States and the United Nations have been
warned for years that its Taliban enemies have been harboring
terrorists in Afghanistan.
	   ``We have been informing the U.N. and also our American friends
that there is connection between the Pakistani military
intelligence ... and the Taliban for taking care of and doing the
management for all these camps for retaining terrorists,'' said
Farhadi, the U.N. representative for Afghan President Burhanuddin
Rabbani who was ousted by the Taliban in 1996.
	   Neighboring Pakistan is the only government to recognize Taliban
rule in Afghanistan. The Taliban, known for their extreme version
of Islam, now control about 90 percent of Afghanistan.
	   Farhadi said he considered ``justice was served'' in the attack
in Afghanistan as long as no innocent civilians were hurt.
	   Clinton said the groups that were struck were affiliated with
bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire whom U.S. officials call a major
sponsor of terrorism.
	   The Taliban have been accused of harboring bin Laden. The
Taliban spokesman in New York could not be reached for comment.
	   Erwa said the United States has not proved that its target in
Sudan was a chemical weapons factory.
	   ``You cannot just say allegations without proving it,'' he said.
	   ``It's not even within the standards of western factories,''
Erwa said. `It's a very small humble factory that can't carry even
two or three machines for antibiotics. My own house is one
kilometer from it.''
	   Erwa also hinted that Clinton may have acted in order to draw
attention from the investigation into his relationship with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
	   ``In my own opinion, it's just a matter domestic politics,'' he
said.

U.S. Marine Hornet jet crashes in Australia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ Rescue teams on Friday searched for the
pilot of a U.S. Marine Corps FA-18 Hornet that crashed southwest of
Katherine in the Northern Territory.
	   The plane crashed while participating in Exercise Southern
Frontier at Delamere Range facility on Thursday evening, the
Australian Defense Force said.
	   The plane was part of an annual bombing training exercise being
undertaken by some 60 U.S. Marines, where they practice placing
bombs on specific targets at specific times.
	   A search team located the wreckage of the Hornet, which went
down close to the range control facility, but the pilot was not
found, Lt. Jo Bastion said.
	   ``We have no idea what has happened to him at all,'' Bastion
said.
	   ``We had a helicopter go out and have a look, but with no
success.''
	   The pilot's name was not released.
	   Rescue teams were at the crash site and air force investigators
from Canberra were expected to arrive at midday, Bastion said.
	   ``The plane came down close to range control facility,'' she
said.
	   ``Certainly other aircraft that were with the Hornet saw it go
down. The range facility was aware of it at the time.''

Australia endorses U.S. strikes on Afghanistan and Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ The U.S. strikes against Afghanistan
and Sudan were perfectly legitimate defensive acts by a nation
protecting its own citizens, Prime Minister John Howard said
Friday.
	   ``My advice is that the strike was based upon very strong ...
evidence the targets against which the strikes were made, were in
fact operational bases or headquarters of the people responsible
for the embassy outrages in Kenya and Tanzania and if that is the
case the Americans were entirely justified in doing what they have
done,'' Howard said on Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   ``Any country is entitled to act in self-defense and to embark
upon a retaliatory strike where there is a clear attack upon its
own citizens and the bomb outrages in those two African countries
more than a week ago were indiscriminate acts of murder and
terrorism.
	   ``They were clearly directed against U.S. citizens _ tragically
also they involved the lives of Kenyan and Tanzanian citizens, so
it wasn't only the Americans that suffered.
	   ``In those circumstances I think any country is entitled to take
retaliatory action and that is what I think the Americans have
done,'' Howard said.

McGwire hits 50th homer as Cardinals down Mets 2-0

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Mets-Cardinals opener; will be updated with late

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Mark McGwire became the first player in U.S.
Major League Baseball history to hit 50 home runs in three
consecutive seasons Thursday night with a towering shot in the
seventh inning of the first game of a doubleheader between the St.
Louis Cardinals and New York Mets.
	   After Brian Jordan led off the seventh with a homer off Willie
Blair, McGwire sent a 2-1 pitch over the wall in left-center.
McGwire, who hit Nos. 48 and 49 on Wednesday, pumped his right fist
above his head as he rounded first base as the large Shea Stadium
crowd gave him a standing ovation.
	   Only Babe Ruth (1920-21 and 1927-28) and McGwire had hit 50 or
more homers in back-to-back seasons before McGwire's 369-foot shot,
which fell in between the outfield wall and the bleachers.
	   McGwire hit 52 homers in 1996 for Oakland and 58 for the
Athletics and Cardinals last year.
	   He is the sixth National League player to hit 50 in a season and
first since George Foster hit 52 in 1977 for Cincinnati. At 34
years, 324 days, McGwire is also the oldest player to hit 50
homers. Johnny Mize was 34 years, 256 days when he connected for
his 50th in 1947.
 &UR; Cubs 7, Giants 3
	   In Chicago, Glenallen Hill, pinch-hitting for pitcher Kevin
Tapani, hit a grand slam home run as the Cubs beat the San
Francisco Giants.
	   It was Hill's third home run of the year and the fifth grand
slam of his career. The victory puts the Cubs, who came into the
game trailing the New York Mets by a game in the NL wild card race,
three games ahead of San Francisco in the race.
	   Tapani (15-7) gave up four hits and three runs _ including two
homers _ in five innings. He also struck out five and walked three.
The Cubs shelled Russ Ortiz (1-3) for seven hits and five runs over
4 2-3 innings. He also walked four and struck out five.
	   Sammy Sosa was quiet a day after hitting his 48th home run,
going 0-for-5 at the plate. He struck out three times.

Palmer to undergo radiation treatments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Arnold Palmer will undergo a seven-week series
of radiation treatments as a follow-up to the golf star's
successful prostate cancer surgery in 1997.
	   Palmer, who will be 69 on Sept. 10, will begin daily treatments
Aug. 31 at Latrobe Area Hospital, near his Pennsylvania home, Doc
Giffin, a spokesman for Palmer, said Thursday.
	   ``Naturally, I'm disappointed to have to forego my business
trips and tournament play, but I certainly do what my doctors tell
me now so that I can get back to all my normal activities as soon
as possible,'' Palmer said.
	   ``Besides, it will give me the opportunity to concentrate on the
writing of my memoirs, something my normal schedule makes rather
difficult.''
	   Palmer underwent surgery in January 1997 at the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minnesota. He returned to competition less than two
months later.
	   ``We are proceeding with this follow-up radiation therapy
because blood studies have indicated that there probably is some
residual microscopic disease existing,'' said Dr. J. Robert Mazero,
Palmer's personal physician. ``There is nothing visible to the
naked eye, but through a consensus of experts we have agreed that
this plan will prevent future trouble.
	   ``This follows what was obviously very successful surgery and is
not surprising nor out the ordinary in such cases. Arnold will not
be incapacitated in any way, but the daily treatments will prevent
him from extensive travel during that period.''
	   Palmer is scheduled to team with Peter Jacobsen on Monday and
Tuesday in the Fred Meyer Challenge at Portland, Ore., and also
plans to attend a golf course opening in Oregon before beginning
the treatments.

	   KANSAS CITY, Missouri (AP) _ Terry Pendleton hit a three-run
homer and drove in four runs on Thursday as the Royals beat the
Boston Red Sox 8-2 and snapped a five-game losing streak.
	   Pendleton's home run, only his second of the year, gave the
Royals a 3-2 lead in the first inning. He added an RBI groundout
for an 8-2 lead in Kansas City's three-run fifth.
	   The Royals finished with 12 hits, 11 of them singles, after
scoring seven runs on 26 hits in their previous four games. It was
only their third win in 11 games against Boston, and came in the
season finale between the two teams.
	   Starter Hipolito Pichardo (7-8) got the win, but he left after
five innings because of soreness in his right shoulder.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The stock market rebound stumbled again
Thursday, but the selling remained fairly modest despite a flurry
of bad news in the computer-chip sector. The Dow Jones industrial
average fell 81 points to 8,611, about 700 points below the record
of 9,337.97 set on July 17. The Dow slipped 21 points on Wednesday
after gaining 290 points the prior two days. Broader indicators
also extended Wednesday's losses, with semiconductor stocks leading
the decline as Merrill Lynch lowered its investment rating on Intel
and Texas Instruments. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government tried to restore some
confidence in the country's shaky banking system Thursday by saying
it would fully guarantee all deposits. The Central Bank proposed a
system of federally backed guarantees to discourage a run on the
assets of commercial banks. Many banks are expected to fail in the
wake of the government's decision this week to let the value of the
national currency, the ruble, fall by up to 35 percent. A top
Central Bank official said only two of the nation's 20 largest
banks were on the verge of collapse _ hardly an overwhelming
statement of confidence, but better than some people had believed.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Energy and precious metals futures prices rose
sharply Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange after the U.S.
military struck suspected terrorist operations in Sudan and
Afghanistan in retaliation for attacks on U.S. embassies in Africa.
Energy futures, which had been languishing throughout the session
on perceptions of ample U.S. and world supplies, jumped in late
trading after the U.S. Defense Department announced attacks on
facilities linked to Osama bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire whom U.S.
officials call a major sponsor of terrorism. President Bill
Clinton's administration has suggested bin Laden was a key figure
in the bombing of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
(US-COMMODITY ROUNDUP)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Claims on European insurance companies for
policies sold to Jews who later died in the Holocaust could pass
the dlrs 1 billion mark, a leading U.S. insurance official said
Thursday. Deborah Senn, insurance commissioner for Washington
state, said in Jerusalem that a dlrs 100 million settlement reached
Wednesday in New York between the Italian insurer Assicurazioni
Generali and Jewish organizations was only a beginning and did not
define the company's total debt to the survivors and heirs. Senn
serves on a nine-member task force negotiating with European
insurance companies on the settlement of the claims.
(ISRAEL-HOLOCAUST CLAIMS)
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Fears of a devaluation Thursday sent
the Caracas stock market to a 28-month low, depressed the value of
Venezuela's debt bonds, forced the government to prop up the
currency through dollar sales, and stirred worries of a domino
effect in Latin America. Government officials categorically denied
a rumor Wednesday that the bolivar currency would be devalued by
17-20 percent, but financial markets remained weary as investors
dumped their Venezuelan stocks and began selling bolivars. The
Venezuelan rumors appear to be undermining investor confidence in
emerging markets, already battered by this week's devaluation in
Russia. (VENEZUELA-ECONOMY)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Manufacturing executives predict a modest
slowdown in orders and hiring over the next three months in part
due to the ongoing economic troubles in Asia, according to a Dun
and Bradstreet Corp. survey released Thursday. The findings differ
from a separate Dun and Bradstreet survey of construction
executives, who believe employment levels will improve
significantly in the coming months. The Murray Hill, New
Jersey-based financial information company found in its July survey
of 1,000 U.S. manufacturing executives that expectations have
decreased since a similar survey was conducted in June.
(US-BUSINESS FUTURES)
	   DENVER (AP) _ Pledging to keep their talks secret, negotiators
for telecommunications giant U S West and its major union started a
dialogue Thursday aimed at ending a strike and sending about 34,000
employees back to work. The meeting with U.S. government mediator
Jim Mahon was the first joint session the two sides have held since
the Communications Workers of America struck last weekend.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Retaliating 13 days after the deadly embassy
bombings in East Africa, U.S. forces launched cruise missile
strikes against alleged terrorist camps in Afghanistan and a
chemical plant in Sudan on Thursday. ``Our target was terror,''
President Bill Clinton declared. He said he acted to ``counter an
immediate threat'' of more terrorist acts. The president said U.S.
intelligence indicated that a ``gathering of key terrorist
leaders'' was planned at the site in Afghanistan for Thursday.
Clinton and defense officials said the facilities attacked were
linked to Osama bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire whom U.S. officials
call a major sponsor of terrorism. (US-CLINTON)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A grenade exploded Thursday night in
front of Cambodia's Interior Ministry, where a prominent opposition
politician was participating in a sleep-in against alleged election
irregularities. A driver for Kyodo News Service of Japan was killed
in the attack, said Deputy Commisioner of the Phnom Penh Municipal
Police, Yet Razaque. Opposition politician Sam Rainsy was unhurt
but was detained by police at gunpoint for several hours in the
ministry compound, which authorities sealed off after the
explosion. Sam Rainsy had announced he would spend Thursday night
in the compound outside the office of the National Election
Committee to publicize his complaints of fraud in last month's
election won by strongman Hun Sen. (CAMBODIA-GRENADE ATTACK)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Looking forward to ``rebuilding her life,''
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky on Thursday finished her
second, and probably last, appearance before the grand jury
investigating a presidential affair and alleged cover-up, her
spokeswoman said. In a development that could mean more trouble for
President Bill Clinton, prosecutors collected a sample of his DNA.
``She answered all questions truthfully and completely,''
spokeswoman Judy Smith said. ``Ms. Lewinsky is now looking forward
to beginning the process of rebuilding her life.'' Ms. Lewinsky
expects it to be her last trip to the grand jury but ``will
continue of course as necessary to fulfill her obligations to the
Office of Independent Counsel,'' Smith said. Ms. Lewinsky strode
quickly into a side entrance of the courthouse without comment
Thursday morning. She left through the same door five hours later.
(US-CLINTON-INVESTIGATION)
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Faced with the threat of outside
intervention, Congolese rebels on Thursday sent mixed messages of
war and peace. After capturing Mbaza-Ngungu, about 150 kilometers
(95 miles) south of the capital Kinshasa, rebel leaders said they
were willing to negotiate a political solution and even a
cease-fire with President Laurent Kabila. Threats of a military
intervention by Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe to back Kabila
appeared to have softened normally tough rebel talk reinforced by
two weeks of uninterrupted advances. In the rebel stronghold in
eastern Congo, civilians and academics from the movement seeking to
take power from Kabila appear to have upstaged hawkish military
commanders who had ruled out negotiations. (CONGO)
	   HARBIN, China (AP) _ Rivers swollen from weeks of rain rushed
over parts of China's largest oil field Thursday and smothered
farming villages outside a key industrial center. Tens of thousands
of soldiers and civilians rushed sandbags to plug leaky dikes _
already piled two meters (six feet) high with the dirt-filled sacks
_ to keep the Songhua River from flooding Harbin, capital of
northeast Heilongjiang province. On the north bank, opposite the
city, the river swallowed dikes and covered fields, leaving only
village roofs poking through the waters. Families took shelter in
trains parked on sidings atop raised rail beds. One couple, their
two children and four cows camped on a garbage heap between the
rail beds. (CHINA-FLOODS)

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Actor Alain Delon on Thursday failed to persuade a
court to order a French magazine off the newsstands after it
published sordid allegations from an planned unauthorized
biography.
	   The tabloid-style newsweekly Marianne apparently got around an
earlier court decision that blocked anyone from even publishing the
book's synopsis, by running court papers that cite its contents.
	   Among the details in the Aug. 17 issue, quoted from the court
papers, were Delon's alleged youthful dalliances with other actors
or actresses and reported ties to shady politicians, mafia figures
and mercenaries.
	   Now 63, Delon was for decades a dashing screen idol in dozens of
movies including ``The Leopard'' and ``Rocco and his Brothers.''
	   Delon attacked the synopsis as defamatory and the court agreed
Aug. 5 to block author Bernard Violet from writing the book, at
least until another hearing set for Oct. 14.

	   WROCLAW, Poland (AP) _ The black, 10-meter (33-foot) mustache
hanging from the town hall can mean only one thing _ an exhibition
of graphics by Spanish surrealist Salvador Dali opened Thursday.
	   It is the first exhibition of Dali's work in post-communist
Poland. During the decades of Soviet-dominated communist rule, the
government banned Dali's art as a sign of the decay and excess of
capitalist culture.
	   Dali, who died in 1989, created the almost 400 graphics from
1935-78 to illustrate literary classics such as Dante Alighieri's
``Divine Comedy'' and Lewis Carroll's ``Alice in Wonderland.''
	   The graphics come from the collection of Heinz Ess of Germany,
whose father was a doctor and Dali's neighbor. Dali paid for his
medical care with the graphics.
	   The exhibition in Wroclaw, about 250 kilometers (150 miles)
southwest of Warsaw, runs through Oct. 10.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ The Spice Girls didn't exactly draw a gambling
crowd for their Las Vegas show.
	   A sold-out crowd of 12,500 consisted mostly of young girls and
their parents, eager to see the British pop quartet Wednesday at
the University of Nevada Las Vegas campus arena.
	   The girls came on 50 minutes late, then took an intermission 40
minutes later, but none of that mattered to the fans who came to
see them.
	   The crowd batted beach balls and screamed seemingly at random _
though reader boards asking such questions as ``Who Wants Spice?''
might have fueled the uproar.
	   The second half saw the girls perform more of their hits,
including ``Wannabe'' and the Latin-flavored ``Spice Up Your
Life.''
	   They also acknowledged their bond with their young audience by
flashing their baby pictures on an overhead screen.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SAULT STE. MARIE, Ontario (AP) _ Canadian folk singer Gordon
Lightfoot will help launch a fund-raising effort next month to
memorialize victims of the more than 6,000 ships that have gone
down in the Great Lakes.
	   Lightfoot, whose ballad ``The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald''
popularized the legend of the ill-fated freighter that sank in
1975, will perform Sept. 19 at Vegas Kewadin in Sault Ste. Marie,
Michigan.
	   The Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society is raising funds to
build a dlrs 4 million expansion of the society's museum at
Whitefish Point, Michigan.
	   The project will list the names and dates of all the ships lost
in the Great Lakes. The centerpiece of the memorial will be the
brass bell from the Edmund Fitzgerald, which lies on the floor of
Lake Superior. The ship took 29 crewmen to the bottom in a gale
Nov. 10, 1975.

IOC regains initiative in anti-doping fight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ After weeks of doping scandals in
sport and confusing signals from Olympic leaders, the IOC is going
on the offensive in the fight against performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Moving to counter the impression that it was weakening in
resolve, the International Olympic Committee announced plans
Thursday to set up a special agency to coordinate random
drug-testing around the world.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch also said the list of
banned substances would not be relaxed as he had previously
espoused in a Spanish newspaper interview.
	   ``We will not withdraw one single performance-enhancing drug
which we have on the list,'' he said. ``Doping is something we can
not permit. First, we have an obligation to protect the health of
the athletes, and second, it's a kind of cheating we can not accept
in sport.''
	   Samaranch convened the emergency meeting of his executive board
to set the agenda for a worldwide doping summit scheduled for
Lausanne next Feb. 2-3. Both meetings were called in response to
the recent doping scandals which rocked cycling, swimming, track
and field and other sports.
	   The centerpiece of Thursday's meeting was the proposal to create
an ``Olympic movement anti-doping agency'' to lead the worldwide
effort against drug cheats.
	   At present, the IOC is directly responsible for drug testing
only during the Olympic Games, while international sports
federations and national bodies supervise their own doping controls
the rest of the time.
	   The proposed new body would assist in financing and conducting
drug tests for Olympic sports, both during and out of competition,
in various parts of the world throughout the year.
	   Catching drug users is most most effective when athletes are
tested without warning during training or between competitions.
	   ``These tests are very expensive,'' Samaranch told a news
conference after the 7 1/2-hour meeting. ``We must have this agency
to help the international federations which don't have enough money
to do this random testing.''
	   The agency would also help set up drug-testing laboratories in
countries and regions without IOC-accredited labs and create a
mobile lab to be used for testing at major events around the world,
such as the Pan American Games, African Games and Central American
Games.
	   Samaranch said the agency would be under the aegis of all
Olympic bodies, not just the IOC, and would have an independent
status. He said it would be headquartered in Lausanne and headed by
an IOC official.
	   The project would be funded from the hundreds of millions of
dollars that the IOC receives in Olympic television rights fees.
Samaranch said it was too early to say how much it would cost.
	   IOC vice president Dick Pound, who will be charge of the
financial details, estimated that the Olympic movement currently
spends dlrs 20 million a year on drug testing.
	   ``If we could double that, we could do some big things,'' he
said.
	   The IOC also identified four main topics for the February
summit: the protection of athletes, political and legal issues,
ethics and prevention, and financial questions. The four IOC vice
presidents were put in charge of task groups to study the issues
and prepare proposals for the February meeting.
	   Samaranch also used Thursday's meeting to clarify his recent
controversial statements in a Spanish newspaper interview. He
stunned the Olympic world, including some of his closest aides,
when he called for a drastic reduction in the list of banned
substances and suggested that only drugs which are harmful to an
athlete should be prohibited.
	   ``I never said performance-enhancing drugs must be withdrawn
from the list,'' Samaranch said Thursday. ``I would like to ask the
medical commission to review the list like they are doing from time
to time. Maybe we need to put the list up to date.
	   ``As for performance-enhancing drugs, there is not a single one
that is not harming the health of the athletes.''
	   Samaranch fell into line with Prince Alexandre de Merode, the
chairman of the IOC medical commission. De Merode had said he was
``aghast'' at the president's reported remarks and insisted the
list would not be reduced.
	   De Merode stressed Thursday that the Olympic movement will never
succeed in wiping out drugs completely.
	   ``We will never win,'' he said. ``We will never eliminate
doping. But we will not lose.''

De Merode settles differences with Samaranch, but remains defiant

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Having settled his differences with
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, Prince Alexandre de Merode
remained defiant, refusing to back down on claims that Spain was
lax in its doping controls.
	   Instead, the head of the IOC medical commission expanded his
attack, claiming most countries have contributed to the current
doping crisis.
	   ``If there is a tendency toward doping for one country, then it
applies to another country,'' de Merode said Thursday. ``Do you
know a country where there isn't a tendency toward doping? It
doesn't exist. It's a reality in all the world.''
	   De Merode had caused a storm of protest in Spain earlier this
week when he told the French newspaper Le Figaro that some Spanish
sports doctors were encouraging the use of banned drugs.
	   ``One must not forget that Spanish sports, for a long time, has
had tendencies toward doping,'' de Merode told the paper.
	   ``It was a banal comment,'' de Merode said Thursday. ``I just
said that there are many doctors who don't abide by medical ethics.
Don't get too excited.''
	   He dismissed Spanish demands that he resign.
	   ``The Spanish outcry doesn't interest me,'' de Merode said. ``It
doesn't move me at all. I will be speaking to Spanish officials.
There is no reason to get upset. The idea wasn't to single out
Spain.''
	   Samaranch scheduled a meeting between himself, de Merode and
Spanish officials in Lausanne on Aug. 30 to clear the air.
	   De Merode had been at odds with Samaranch, who was earlier
quoted in a Spanish newspaper as saying the IOC's list of banned
substances should be slashed.
	   But by the end of Thursday's meeting, the two men sat side by
side at a news conference to present a united front.
	   If anything, it was Samaranch who appeared to fall in line with
de Merode's views.
	   Despite his earlier statements that harmless drugs should be
removed from the IOC's banned substances list, Samaranch was quick
to insist the current list should remain intact.
	   ``Not a single substance will be taken off the banned substances
list,'' said Samaranch. ``I will follow the advice of the medical
commission. If they think that using a certain drug is cheating
then I will follow their views.''
	   Clearly supported by the IOC president, de Merode moved to other
problems.
	   While the IOC plans to pour millions of dollars into a new
Olympic Movement Anti-Doping Agency project, it has yet to come up
with effective tests for many of the most problematic drugs such as
synthetic EPO, used to enhance red blood cell production.
	   De Merode reiterated his views on how blood tests were currently
useless and urine testing the only adequate form of testing
available.
	   ``When we have an effective blood test we'll use it,'' he said.
``Currently those tests are not valid.
	   ``The UCI (International Cycling Union) used blood testing
during the Tour de France, but those tests cannot absolutely prove
the use of EPO and real proof is what is needed. It was a good
experiment but the tests have done their time.''

	   WOBURN, Massachusetts (AP) _ Dominic J. Mercurio clearly
remembers the year 1945, standing in a field outside Frankfurt,
Germany, as dozens of Nazi soldiers surrendered.
	   ``They just laid down their rifles,'' recalls Mercurio, now 74
and living in East Boston. ``They were so tired of fighting.''
	   Like many other soldiers that day, Mercurio took one of the
weapons, a 1934 Browning pistol. For more than 50 years, he held on
to it as a memento of proud service with the Army's 66th Infantry
Division.
	   But last month, at a Boston-area sale of World War II military
memorabilia, Mercurio sold it. Military Antiques, a company based
in Lindsey, Ohio, paid him dlrs 175.
	   ``I've showed it to my grandson, but I don't need to keep it
around anymore,'' Mercurio told company owner Jason Burmeister.
``It's been a long time.''
	   Mercurio was one of scores of veterans and kin who came to a
Woburn hotel to sell spoils of war, from German and Japanese forces
that surrendered military gear to U.S. soldiers.
	   Some, like 76-year-old Bill Marshall of Revere, Massachusetts,
sold a German dagger because its importance had faded.
	   ``You only value them if you went through it,'' says Marshall,
who transported German war criminals to the Nuremberg trials during
an Army stint. ``There's no value if you didn't.''
	   A half-century after the war, souvenirs are surfacing in flea
markets and private sales around the country _ a signal of passing
interest and passing generations.
	   ``The children don't want to hurt their feelings, but they just
don't care,'' says Brian Maerderer, owner of Military Collectibles
of Churchville, Pennsylvania. And that spurs veterans to act.
``They're afraid their kids are going to throw them away or sell
them for nothing. They would rather sell it themselves.''
	   Burmeister and Maerderer are among a handful of private
collectors specializing in rare or well-cared-for military
memorabilia of World War II. It's a niche market that's getting a
boost from such high-profile films as ``Saving Private Ryan.''
	   Advertising in local newspapers, newsletters and on the
Internet, collectors search for German firearms, Japanese samurai
swords, medals and uniforms and other memorabilia.
	   The collectors, Burmeister says, profit by resale to a loose
national network of up to 7,000 serious private collectors, as well
as tens of thousands of hobbyists.
	   Reselling occurs largely by mail, with dealers offering detailed
descriptions to customers seeking specific pieces.
	   The market for World War II memorabilia is not nearly so large
or lucrative as that for the Revolutionary and Civil wars. Though
millions died in the world's deadliest war, millions also survived
_ and carried souvenirs from the front lines. An estimated 1
million samurai swords came from occupied Japan, their very numbers
diminishing their value for museums or historians.
	   The large supply of European memorabilia in the United States
keeps profit margins relatively small, with dealers reselling at
about a 30 percent markup. Firearms and other weapons in good
condition are generally bought and resold for less than dlrs 1,000.
	   ``It's not a real moneymaker most of the time,'' says
Burmeister. And he's selective, rejecting as much as 90 percent of
what veterans offer, due to oversupply or poor quality.
	   World War II is also a tough sell because so many items bear
swastikas and other reminders of the Holocaust.
	   Many customers buy surreptitiously. ``There is a great stigma
still associated with the Nazi era,'' says Maerderer. ``But I don't
sell politics, I sell history.''
	   Both he and Burmeister focus on collectors with a legitimate
interest in history, avoiding extremists who attach Nazi symbols to
far-right political agendas.''It's upsetting when people ask us if
we are neo-Nazis,'' says Burmeister. ``But what I do is no
different than Confederate or Napoleonic era collectibles. It's
part of history ... .''
	   In the Boston area, Burmeister bought several dozen Japanese
swords for dlrs 250 to dlrs 500 each. He paid dlrs 800 for a German
officer's dagger with Nazi emblems and a blade engraved ``All For
Germany.'' Two 1939 naval plotting instruments in mint condition
and still bearing notes scribbled in German cost him dlrs 550.
	   Although most souvenirs sell for modest prices, Burmeister says
a few items _especially those linked to Hitler or his inner circle
_can command more. One Midwest collector paid dlrs 2,000 for a
silver teapot and creamer. Silver votive candleholders drew dlrs
1,000.
	   More often, the glut of common World War II items undermines
deals.
	   Al Ciano, 78, of Everett, Massachusetts, is a veteran of the
Battle of the Bulge. He left the sale having failed to unload
German military pins and tattered armbands with Nazi swastikas.
	   ``I don't know what I'll do with them,'' he said. ``They're
worth something sentimentally to me.''

 &UR; Before he disappeared, prof devoted life to `a careful study of
death' &QL; 
 &UR; By BRIAN MURPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SPARTA, Greece (AP) _ Each step was meticulously plotted: credit
cards left for his wife, letters for friends, car keys placed where
they could be found in his BMW. He even filled the gas tank and
left money for tolls.
	   Then the professor who was drawn to the study of death, who
struggled with mortality and meaning in eight books, simply
vanished.
	   In the thick forests and sun-bleached crags towering above his
home village near the southern city of Sparta, no trace of Dimitri
Liandinis has been found.
	   Still, the trail points just one way. His solo trek into the
mountains in early June was the culmination of a career obsessed by
the interplay of life and death.
	   Don't fear the end, he often told his philosophy students at the
University of Athens. Embrace it, understand it. Death, he said,
bestows context and texture to life.
	   Although he lectured and wrote tirelessly, there was one topic
he kept tucked away from almost everyone. It was the evolution of a
personal doctrine about death, about a ritualistic, symbolic
termination of life, cheating age and illness.
	   A dominant inspiration was a 5th century B.C. Greek philosopher,
Empedocles. Legend says he threw himself into a crater on the Mount
Etna volcano on Sicily when he was 56 years old _ the same age as
Liandinis when he vanished.
	   The professor could be dismissed as a misguided intellectual
with a death wish. In Greece, however, such passion draws its share
of admirers.
	   ``Don't say suicide,'' urged Liandinis' wife, Nicolitsa, also a
university professor. ``Suicide doesn't count here. My husband was
a rare creation.''
	   Yet not unique in Greece.
	   Few heirs of the ancient Western world identify with their
patrimony as closely as the Greeks.
	   For four centuries of Ottoman rule, which ended with
independence in the 1820s, Greeks were kept from honoring their
ancient civilization, which was preserved and studied elsewhere in
Europe. Once free, Greeks eagerly embraced this legacy, and it
helped unify the young nation divided by feuding clans and a Babel
of dialects.
	   Now, Greece is infused with its once-forgotten heritage.
	   Liandinis studied the ancients but also the modern ethnocentric
creeds of writers such as Pericles Yiannopoulos, who contended that
the Greek aesthetic was innately superior to all others.
	   Yiannopoulos, who became a hero among ultra-nationalists,
garlanded a horse with roses and rode into the sea outside Athens
in April 1910. When the water reached his knees, he killed himself
with a gunshot to the head.
	   Now the professor's apparent suicide was being debated at a cafe
in Sparta by a group of laborers. They commiserated with his wife.
But they all lauded Liandinis as a man of unwavering conviction _
of ``pathos,'' or passion. This, to them, was his birthright as a
Greek.
	   ``To Greece. To pathos,'' toasted Costas Theocopoulos, a road
worker, raising a glass of white wine.
	   Death was Liandinis' intellectual companion.
	   He wrote eight books, each in some way exploring the Greek
character and the inevitability of dying. Increasingly, he returned
to the concept that ancient Greeks idealized death before age
sapped beauty and creativity.
	   ``He thought that every righteous person, himself included,
should have a nice death,'' his wife said. ``Death in old age was
always something horrifying to him.''
	   But he wasn't morose about it. Colleagues and former students
described him as an affable man with a sharp intellect. He loved to
ski, swim and scan the stars with his telescope.
	   When Liandinis spoke about his theories of confronting death,
his wife considered it just part of her husband's deeply
introspective nature.
	   ``He made me believe it was on a philosophical level, an
imaginative level ... I thought he used it as a medium of
expression. I could never imagine he would actually do it,'' said
Ms. Liandinis in their Athens home awash in the tide of Liandinis'
research: books, manuscripts, papers. Liandinis never learned to
use a computer and wrote everything in a tight, precise script.
	   On May 31, Liandinis returned home after spending several days
in and around Sparta. He visited his 90-year-old mother and called
on old friends. He walked through the hills around his tiny village
_ several homes on a dirt road shaded by sweet-smelling eucalyptus
trees.
	   In the middle of the night, Ms. Liandinis said she awoke from a
dream in which shadows closed around her husband. Liandinis kissed
her. ``You're Caesar's wife,'' he said, referring to a tale about
her premonition of Caesar's murder.
	   When Ms. Liandinis returned home from the university on June 1,
she walked from room to room gathering the pieces left by her
husband. There was a two-page letter to their daughter, Diotima,
that began: ``I leave willingly ... I have been preparing for this
my entire life, which has been, above all, a careful study of
death.''
	   On the couch, a book was open to a page about Caesar's wife.
Personal items _ credit cards, money, reading glasses _ were laid
out on a table. On the night stand was a copy of a philosophy book,
``A Life Entombed,'' in which Liandinis wrote a line dated May 31:
``Tomorrow, well, tomorrow is the big day.''
	   On June 3, his car was found in Sparta parked in front of the
library. It was full of gas and the window was left open enough to
unlock the door without smashing the glass. There were postal
receipts for letters to friends.
	   Toll money was left and the keys were covered by a copy of
Liandinis' latest book, ``Gemma,'' a collection of musings about
mortality. In one passage, Liandinis described Empedocles' leap as
``one of the most human acts ever carried out.'' The text also
carries several references to the Taygetos mountain chain, which
comes to a pinnacle 8,141 feet above the plain of Sparta.
	   Liandinis took a taxi to a mountaineers' shelter at the base of
the peak, police said. He has not been seen since.
	   The alpine search was scaled back after a few days. Eventually,
the professor's mother asked that it be called off. She said her
son's body should not be disturbed.
	   ``He tried to live his death,'' said his wife. ``He wanted, in
some way that only he understood, to beat death.''

A rare gold for Estonia, a repeat for Spain

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Outside Estonia, Erki Nool may not be a
household name. But in his tiny Baltic homeland, Nool is the most
popular athlete. Now he is a hero.
	   With an astonishing heave of the javelin, Nool gave Estonia its
first European Championship gold medal since 1938 and captured the
gold medal in the decathlon, the grueling two-day event.
	   ``I cannot tell you how happy I am,'' said the 28-year-old
athlete.
	   ``In the beginning I felt strong and hoped for a medal. After
the pole vault I was sure of at least the silver, and after the
javelin I knew I had won,'' Nool said.
	   Nool was lagging sixth after six events. But then he cleared
5.40 meters in the pole vault and then stunned the field with a
throw of 70.65 meters in the ninth event of the decathlon. That
gave him the lead for good.
	   He collected a winning total of 8,667 points.
	   One page of the official championship statistics gives the date
of Estonia's last gold medal as 1934, the inaugural championship.
	   But Nool knew his history and quickly set the record straight.
He was Estonia's first gold medalist since 1938, when Aleksander
Kreek won the shot put.
	   Soon after that, Estonia was swallowed up by the neighboring
Soviet Union, before regaining independence in the collapse of
communism.
	   Eduard Hamalainen of Finland, coming off left-knee and right
Achilles tendon surgeries, had to settle for silver after holding
the lead in the middle stages. He was more than 15 meters behind
Nool in the javelin.
	   Eduard Hamalainen, who was born in the Soviet Union after his
grandfather had been deported from Finland, now competes for the
country of his roots. Lev Lobodin of Russia clinched the bronze.
	   While Estonia got a rare gold, Spain got a gold it expected in
the men's 1,500.
	   It didn't come from Fermin Cacho, but from Reyes Estevez. Cacho
started the strong Spanish showing in the distance by winning the
Olympic gold in Barcelona in 1992. He also had the silver in
Atlanta four years later and another silver at last year's worlds.
	   Cacho was the defending champion here, but he had no chance
against Estevez, the fastest in Europe this year at the distance.
	   A strong finisher, Estevez pulled away with 200 meters left in a
slow race to cruise home in 3:41.31.
	   Rui Silva of Portugal, who was slightly ahead entering the last
lap, held off Cacho to win the silver in 3:41.84. Cacho finished in
3:42.13 for the bronze.
	   Other champions Thursday: Pavel Januszewski of Poland in the
men's 400 hurdles; Yelena Afanasyeva of Russia in the women's 800;
Annarita Sidoti of Italy in the women's 20K; Vita Pavlish of
Ukraine in the women's shot put, with a heave of 21.69 meters, a
championship record and the best in the world this year; and Olga
Vasdeki of Greece in the women's triple jump.

Camps teach foreign language by immersing kids in the culture

<TEXT>
	   VERGAS, Minnesota (AP) _ The Kremlin. The Bolshoi Theater. The
Hermitage.
	   Down a dirt road nestled in Minnesota's north woods, namesakes
of these Russian landmarks are home to a hundred children from
around the world who spend part of their summer learning, and
living, another language.
	   Youngsters aged 7 to 18 spend up to four weeks studying _ and
playing _ in one of 10 language camps offered by Concordia Language
Villages. By the time they leave, they will have eaten another
country's food, spent its currency and learned some of its
language.
	   From the time youngsters arrive, they're in another country.
They go through customs with a passport. They are assigned new
names and a cabin, typically identified by a city or region.
	   Besides Russian, children can study Chinese, Danish, Finnish,
French, German, Japanese, Norwegian, Spanish and Swedish. Four of
the camps have permanent, architecturally authentic sites around
Turtle River Lake near Bemidji, about 200 miles (320 kilometers)
northwest of Minneapolis.
	   The villages are sponsored by Concordia College, a four-year
private liberal arts school in Moorhead, Minnesota. The first
village, German, opened in 1961 and counts Chelsea Clinton, who
attended for six summers, as an alumna.
	   Before a lunch of black bread sandwiches and borscht at the
Russian camp on a recent hot day, each of the foods was introduced
in Russian, with the campers repeating the words. Later, they sang
a Russian thank-you to the cooks.
	   ``It's a living laboratory. The kids use this stuff, so they
have to learn it,'' says Laurie Iudin-Nelson, dean of the Russian
village for 10 years and an assistant professor of Russian studies
at Luther College in Decorah, Iowa.
	   ``The first thing that makes it tick ... is that you have
language and tasks and living totally interwoven,'' says Heidi
Byrnes, a Georgetown University professor of German who is studying
how language is learned in the villages.
	   ``Your life and learning are totally connected,'' she says.
	   Singing is one way to get youngsters excited.
	   The wooden deck shakes as ``Russian'' campers jump and wiggle
their arms and legs, belting out a Russian version of the
hokeypokey. Guitars, tambourine and balalaika, a triangle-shaped,
banjo-like instrument, make it an impromptu concert.
	   ``Some kids are very interested in being here because they have
family heritage, ethnic ties,'' says Iudin-Nelson, who goes by the
Russian name ``Larisa'' at camp. Others attend because they live
with parents who work abroad, and some are just interested in a new
language and culture.
	   Dima and Misha Bernstein's father is from Odessa, Ukraine, so
the Minneapolis-area brothers want to learn Russian.
	   ``We know Russian, but we don't know, like, sentences,'' says
Misha, 13, wearing a T-shirt with the word ``Peace'' surrounded by
flags of various countries. ``The main reason me and Dima came is
my entire side of my father's family knows Russian _ except us
two.''
	   Is learning a new alphabet and words difficult?
	   ``Nothing's really hard. You just have to practice,'' Misha
says. ``It's just like looking at it and figuring out a new code.''
	   A 15-minute drive away is the Japanese village, where a red
ceremonial gate graces the grounds.
	   Three boys practice kendo, loud cracks resounding when they make
contact with bamboo swords called shinai. Their instructor, wearing
a floor-length navy blue gown and black breastplate, fields their
questions _ in Japanese.
	   Across camp in ``Kyushu,'' the dean's cabin, shoes must be
removed at the door. Lindsey Johnston, 14, of Princeton Junction,
New Jersey, kneels next to Anna Pinkert, 13, of Skokie, Illinois.
Both wear blue floral kimono and sit quietly as Yoko Seki shows
them how to perform a tea ceremony.
	   ``It's beautiful how everything is perfectly measured,'' says
Lindsey, whose camp name is Etsuko.
	   Besides language, children learn about world events.
	   ``We want to expose young people to global issues. We want young
people to not only learn language and culture, but to develop
sensitivity to issues that affect our world,'' says Steven Restad,
a spokesman for the villages.
	   The Russian camp itself is a lesson in political change. The end
of the Cold War means the village can get staff directly from
Russia, making the program more authentic.
	   Andrei Zainouldinov teaches Russian language and culture to
foreign students at St. Petersburg University in Russia. But he
spends his summers _ this is his sixth _ in Minnesota, teaching
students who will get high school credit for their summer study.
	   Until the collapse of communism and the Soviet Union, ``I
couldn't even dream'' of coming to America, he says.
	   For some children, the villages can be too authentic.
	   ``The hardest thing is the food,'' says Chris ``Kazunori''
Scheirer, a 15-year-old from Boston spending his first summer at
the Japanese village.
	   ``I love the food, but sometimes you get a craving for a
hamburger.''

	   In a letter Thursday to the council president, Ambassador Bill
Richardson defended the military strikes, saying repeated threats
by Osama Bin Laden's terrorist organization left Washington ``no
choice but to use armed force to prevent these attacks from
continuing.''
	   He cited Article 51 of the U.N. charter, which states that
nothing ``shall impair the inherent right of individual or
collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a member
of the United Nations.''
	   The article requires member states report any such actions to
the Security Council.
	   President Bill Clinton said U.S. forces carried out the strikes
in retaliation for the bombings at U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya
and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which killed over 250 people.
	   ``The targets struck, and the timing and method of attack used,
were carefully designed to minimize risks of collateral damage to
civilians and to comply with international law, including the rules
of necessity and proportionality,'' Richardson wrote.
	   In April, Richardson travelled to Afghanistan, where the
Saudi-born Bin Laden lives, and received a promise from Taliban
leaders to keep him ``under wraps'' and prevent him from using
Afghanistan as a base for terrorist activities.
	   ``It is the sincere hope of the United States government that
these limited actions will deter and prevent the repetition of
unlawful terrorist attacks on the United States and other
countries,'' Richardson wrote. ``We call on all nations to take the
steps necessary to bring such indiscriminate terrorism to an end,''
he wrote in the letter to council president Danilo Turk of
Slovenia.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Angry Sudanese stormed the empty U.S.
Embassy compound in Khartoum early Friday morning after U.S. jets
attacked a pharmaceutical plant in the Sudanese capital.
	   State-run Sudan Television showed scores of people scaling the
wrought-iron fence around the embassy in the heart of the capital.
	   Hundreds more outside the fence threw stones at the building to
express their anger or struck at the fence with sticks.
	   They shouted ``Allahu Akbar,'' the Muslim rally cry meaning
``God is Great,'' and ``Down, Down USA'' in English.
	   Protesters who got inside the compound could be seen pulling
down the American flag and dragging it on the ground. It was
unclear from the TV footage if they got inside the locked building.
	   Police could be seen on the street in front of the complex but
did not stop the mob. There was no footage to indicate if the crowd
remained in compound or was dispersed by police.
	   The State Department ordered local staff to leave the the
embassy after the Aug. 7 bombings of embassies in Nairobi, Kenya,
and Dar es-Salaam.
	   American diplomats were pulled out of Khartoum in 1996 after the
State Department said it could no longer guarantee their security.
Diplomats stationed in Cairo and in Nairobi visit Khartoum
periodically for consular services.
	   Sudan's president, Omar el-Bashir, called on Sudanese to protest
the attack Friday.
	   ``Sudanese people will defend themselves,'' el-Bashir told
state-run television in a broadcast monitored in Cairo.
	   He suggested U.S. President Clinton attacked Sudan to draw
attention from his relationship with a former White House intern.
	   Clinton ``stood in front of all the people and announced that he
is corrupt and a liar,'' he said.
	   Sudan's information minister, Ghazi Salah-Eddin, said two U.S.
warplanes fired five missiles that struck the pharmaceutical
factory at 7:15 p.m. (1715 gmt)

Protesters storm U.S. Embassy compound after attack on factory

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Angry Sudanese stormed the empty U.S.
Embassy compound in Khartoum early Friday and pulled down the
American flag to protest a U.S. missile attack on a pharmaceutical
plant in the Sudanese capital.
	   Sudanese government officials termed the missile attack ``a
criminal act'' and charged that it had been ordered by President
Clinton to draw attention away from his troubles in the Monica
Lewinsky sex scandal.
	   They said at least seven workers at the factory were injured in
the Thursday night attack and that some workers still were
unaccounted for and could be beneath the rubble.
	   Hours later, state-run Sudan Television showed scores of people
scaling the wrought-iron fence around the embassy in the heart of
the capital.
	   Hundreds more outside the fence threw stones at the building or
beat the fence with sticks.
	   They shouted ``Allahu Akbar,'' the Muslim rally cry meaning
``God is Great,'' and ``Down, Down USA'' in English.
	   The protesters pulled down the embassy flag and dragged it on
the ground.
	   It was unclear from the TV footage if they got inside the locked
building, and there was no footage to indicate if the mob remained
inside the compound or was dispersed by police.
	   The State Department ordered local staff to leave the the
embassy after the Aug. 7 bombings of embassies in Nairobi, Kenya,
and Dar es-Salaam.
	   American diplomats were pulled out of Khartoum in 1996 after
Washington said it could no longer guarantee their security.
Diplomats stationed in Cairo and in Nairobi visit Khartoum
periodically to provide consular services.
	   Clinton ordered the attack on the factory in Khartoum in
retaliation for the Aug. 7 bombings of the American embassies in
East Africa. U.S. missiles also struck suspected camps of Muslim
militant Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said in Washington that the
factory in Khartoum had been targeted as a suspected chemical
weapons site.
	   Sudan's president, Omar el-Bashir, called on Sudanese to protest
the attack Friday and said he would seek a U.N. investigation into
what the plant produced.
	   ``Sudanese people will defend themselves,'' el-Bashir told
state-run television in a broadcast monitored in Cairo.
	   Sudan's information minister, Ghazi Salah-Eddin, also denied the
weapons allegation, saying the factory produced ``cheap medicines
... for the diseases found in Sudan.''
	   He said the El-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co. was hit by
five missiles at 7:15 p.m. (1715 gmt) Thursday and that ``the
destruction is total.''
	   He called it ``a criminal act'' and accused the Clinton
administration of trying to draw public attention from the Lewinsky
case.
	   ``They want to distract the American people,'' Salah-Eddin said.
	   Mohammed al-Amin, head of the political committee of the
National Congress, which is a grass-roots citizens' advisory body,
called on the United Nations to send a team to investigate the
incident and urged a ``general mobilization'' for the Sudanese
army.
	   In Cairo, airport officials said that a German passenger jet en
route to Khartoum from Frankfurt was ordered back to Cairo by its
headquarters after the U.S. missile strike. The officials, speaking
on customary condition of anonymity, said there were 96 passengers
aboard.
	   A number of Sudan's allies spoke out in its defense.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi telephoned el-Bashir and
``condemned the unjust aggression,'' the television said. State-run
Iraq television accused the United States used ``systematic
international terrorism.''
	   Earlier this year, the American magazine U.S. News and World
Report quoted a secret congressional report as saying Iraq had
built chemical weapons plants in Sudan. This was never publicly
confirmed by U.S. officials.
	   Last December, a Sudanese opposition group charged in a
statement faxed to The Associated Press in Cairo that the Sudanese
government was making chemical weapons in Khartoum and two other
cities and using them in its war against southern rebels.

Taliban say bin Laden is safe

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The man the United States accuses of
directing embassy bombings in Africa has escaped unhurt in U.S.
military strikes on two of his bases, Afghanistan's Taliban rulers
said.
	   Osama Bin Laden ``is safe and no damage has been done to any of
his companions,'' said Mullah Abdullah, a spokesman reached at
Taliban headquarters in the southern city of Kandahar after
Thursday's bombing.
	   The Taliban spokesman did not say where bin Laden was, or
whether he had been at the targeted sites at the time of the
attacks. The government also had no reaction to the U.S. offensive.
	   Bin Laden has been living in Afghanistan with the permission of
the Taliban, a hard-line Islamic group that controls most of the
country.
	   U.S President Bill Clinton said he ordered U.S. military attacks
after linking bin Laden's facilities to the embassy bombings in
Africa, which killed 257 people.
	   ``Today we have struck back,'' the president declared.
	   Bin Laden is a Saudi millionaire whom U.S. officials say is a
major sponsor of terrorism. He has been outspoken in his criticism
of the United States, calling on Muslims to attack U.S. interests
around the world.
	   Abdullah said the United States launched air attacks on Khost,
90 miles (144 kilometers) south, and on Jalalabad, 60 miles (96
kilometers) east of Kabul, both near the border of Pakistan's
Northwest Frontier Province.
	   In Washington, U.S. officials said cruise missiles targeted six
terrorism-related sites, including a base, support camp and four
training facilities.
	   The officials said the missiles were launched from ships in the
Persian Gulf. In Islamabad, though, a Pakistani defense official
indicated they were fired from U.S. warplanes.
	   The Pakistani official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the Islamabad government received no warning of the attack and had
not given its consent for U.S. aircraft to fly across its
territory.
	   The official said 16 U.S. aircraft flew across Pakistan at
40,000 feet (12,000 meters) late Thursday. Another defense official
added that the planes took off from Oman, an Arabian state across
the Arabian Sea from Pakistan, and were armed with cruise missiles.
	   Bin Laden was scheduled to have addressed a religious meeting in
Khost on Thursday before the attacks, said a government source in
Pakistan, speaking on condition of anonymity and citing Pakistani
intelligence agents.
	   The Afghan capital, Kabul, was quiet late Thursday. Word of the
U.S. attacks came near midnight, when most of the city was asleep.
	   A day before, the United States had warned non-Muslim foreign
aid workers to leave Afghanistan, saying they had learned of
``credible threats'' against them. The U.S. Embassy spokesman in
neighboring Pakistan had refused to elaborate on the threats.
	   Speculation about a possible U.S. attack had been fueled by the
evacuation a day earlier of all but essential embassy staff in
Pakistan. The attacks could spark angry, potentially violent
reactions in both Afghanistan and Pakistan.
	   Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz refused comment after the
attacks were announced, saying he had been awakened by a call from
The Associated Press.
	   Although the Pakistani government is a U.S. ally, a vocal
minority in the officially Islamic country paints the United States
as an enemy of Islam. The Pakistani government is likely to face
domestic political pressure if it is learned that it facilitated an
attack on bin Laden.

 &UR; Dollar higher, Tokyo stock prices slip in early trading &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Okura and Co. in graf 9 takes an ampersand &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar edged higher against the yen early
Friday, partly on news of U.S. air strikes against suspected
terrorist targets. Japanese stock prices fell moderately.
	   The dollar bought 143.12 yen in early trading, up 0.57 yen from
late Thursday in Tokyo but slightly lower than its late New York
rate of 143.19 yen overnight.
	   Traders said the dollar's firmness also derived from a belief
among investors that Japan's efforts to reorganize the nation's
ailing financial system may take more time than expected.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton announced Thursday he ordered cruise
missile attacks on sites in Afghanistan and Sudan linked to Osama
bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire whom U.S. officials call a major
sponsor of terrorism.
	   The attacks were in response to the August 7 bombings at the
U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania,
which killed 257 people and injured more than 5,500 people.
	   The U.S. currency is regarded as a safe haven in times of
international unrest.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average shed 108.69 points, or 0.71 points, to 15,282.72
points in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Thursday, the average
fell 14.93 points, or 0.10 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange slipped 8.01 points, or 0.68 percent,
to 1,173.66. The TOPIX closed down 2.04 points, or 0.17 percent,
the day before.
	   Stocks started lower following an overnight drop on Wall Street
and news that medium-sized Japanese trading firm Okura and Co. was
to file for bankruptcy.
	   The Nihon Keizai financial daily reported Friday morning that
Okura had total liabilities of about 300 billion yen (U.S. dlrs 2.1
billion).
	   The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 8,611.41 on Thursday,
down 81.87 from Wednesday's finish.
	   In Tokyo, shares of ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan rose
to 65 yen (45 U.S. cents) per share in early trading, up 9 yen (6
cents), on reports that drastic restructuring measures for the bank
were being mapped out.
	   In the fixed-income security market, the yield on the benchmark
No. 182 10-year Japanese government bond was unquoted in early
trading, compared with Thursday's finish of 111.80 yen. It price,
also unchanged, settled at 1.190 percent Thursday.

Anger, fear brew in Kinshasa as rebels draw nearer

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Rebels may be looking to talk peace, but
war remains the reality in Congo's troubled capital.
	   With an army of rebels on the march toward Kinshasa, fear and
uncertainty now fill a city that 15 months ago rejoiced when former
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko was ousted from power.
	   Residents struggled through much of the week without
electricity, which also caused shortages of water and fuel. Where
dwindling food stocks were still available, prices have spiraled.
	   Dilapidated hospitals have filled with the wounded and dead from
battles 100 miles from here.
	   ``How much, just how much do we have to take?'' says Ngengele
Sukusuku, a shop owner who closed his store earlier in the week for
fear of looting. ``We can't run like the Americans can. We're stuck
here, and this is our lives.''
	   Fearing the worst, many countries including the United States
have closed their embassies and evacuated many of their nationals.
	   Rebel leaders said Wednesday they were willing to negotiate a
political solution and even a cease-fire with President Laurent
Kabila.
	   Threats of a military intervention by Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe to back Kabila appeared to have softened normally
tough rebel talk.
	   In South Africa, President Nelson Mandela, apparently angered by
Zimbabwe's action, said he had asked his Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki to speak to Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and that
Museveni would call a cease-fire by the rebels, the South African
Press Association reported.
	   Kabila has throughout insisted that neighboring Rwanda
orchestrated the revolt with the support of Uganda _ a charge both
countries deny.
	   By night, gunfire echoes from some neighborhoods, where unrest
accompanies fear and anger.
	   Trying to make sense of their plight, people cluster around
transistor radios to listen to news dispatches. Shortwave
broadcasts from foreign journalists tell stories of advancing
rebels and Kabila's troubled government.
	   Local state-run radio says those reports are lies, inciting
anger at the West.
	   Throughout the city, there is a sense that Kinshasa is under
siege.
	   The city's power supply was cut off for three days by rebels who
control a key power dam 125 miles (200 kilometers) away. Power came
back on briefly Thursday morning before going out again.
	   The rebels, an army made up of ethnic Tutsis, Rwandan soldiers
and disenchanted members of Kabila's own military, apparently
restored power for a bit Thursday.
	   ``This was the act of a terrorist group,'' Congo's Minister for
Human Rights Leonard She Okitundu said before the power switched
back on. ``We have been cut off from clean water, our hospitals are
not able to function. The aggressors say they want to liberate the
people, but they are killing those people they want liberate.''
	   At Kinshasa's General Hospital, the power outage prevented all
blood transfusions and made infant incubators useless. A small
backup generator kept the main operating room running.
	   By day, streets fill with people in a frenetic scramble to stock
up on provisions. Platoons of camouflage-clad soldiers roam
sidewalks, while truckloads of armed troops race past.
	   Many are supporting the president because they fear their future
if Kabila's regime falls to the rebels. But many also agree that in
his 15 months as president, Kabila has done little to help the
country's crippled economy.
	   The majority of the city's population is jobless, and street
kids dart between cars in search of a handout.
	   Kabila's rule also has been marked by a crackdown on dissent.
Journalists, opposition and human rights activists and even a U.N.
official have been detained.
	   For the people of Congo, this latest conflict is a no-win
situation.
	   ``You can never install democracy by war,'' Kinshasa resident
Alain Naweg said.

French visit seeks to capitalize on moderate signs from Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Trying to take advantage of Iran's nascent openings
to the West, France's foreign minister heads to Tehran on Friday
for a visit aimed at boosting economic ties as much as political
ones.
	   The two-day trip by Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine is the
highest-level French visit in seven years.
	   Coming only weeks after the visit of Italy's prime minister, it
is a clear sign that Europe, eager to increase trade with Iran, is
moving to capitalize quickly on the moderate signs coming out of
Tehran since the election of President Mohammad Khatami a year ago.
	   It also comes amid a tentative but obvious softening of the
relationship between Iran and the United States _ or ``The Great
Satan,'' as it's been known in Iran since the 1979 Islamic
Revolution.
	   Vedrine says he plans to broach all subjects, including the
thorniest issue affecting Iran's ties to the West: terrorism.
	   The subject clearly will be on the front burner, with the recent
attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and Washington's
retaliatory attacks Thursday in Sudan and Afghanistan. Iran has
condemned the embassy bombings.
	   ``I intend to talk about everything when I am in Iran,'' Vedrine
said Thursday. His spokeswoman said he'd be carrying a message from
President Jacques Chirac.
	   Much has happened in a year. Only last April, the 15 European
Union countries broke off regular contacts with Iran and withdrew
their envoys after a German court found Iranian leaders ordered the
1992 assassination of Kurdish dissidents in Berlin.
	   But four months later, the moderate Khatami was elected by a
landslide, and a month after that the EU ambassadors returned. In
January, Khatami called for a ``break in the wall of mistrust''
with the United States. In March, the Europeans resumed ministerial
talks.
	   Earlier this summer, both U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright made conciliatory statements
to Iran. Clinton said it was ``changing in a positive way,'' and
Albright said it was ``time to test the possibilities for bridging
this gap.''
	   In light of improving ties between Tehran and Washington,
Vedrine feels he can serve a useful role by raising some of the
problem issues between the two capitals _ problems that pose an
obstacle to closer European-Iranian ties, too.
	   Chief among them: terrorism. The United States has long seen
Iran as a rogue state that sponsors terrorism, and Albright has
said European allies ``just don't get it'' about Iran's terrorist
activity.
	   The issue directly concerns France. In the last 10 years, eight
Iranian dissidents have been assassinated on French soil; the last
as recently as 1996. They're believed to have been killed by
Iranian government hit squads.
	   Other issues sure to be brought up during Vedrine's visit are
Iran's role in the Mideast peace process, which the minister on
Thursday called ``very negative''; attempts to develop weapons of
mass destruction, and human rights, including the nearly
10-year-old death sentence on British author Salman Rushdie.
	   While France may envision a role in facilitating an Iran-U.S.
rapprochement _ Vedrine and Albright discussed the visit last week
_ there is one area where Paris and Washington could become rivals
in the event of such a reconciliation: trade.
	   European companies have benefited from U.S. economic sanctions.
Last year, Washington wasn't pleased when the French oil giant
Total, which is partly state-owned, signed a dlrs 2 billion
contract in Iran to expand a southern gas field, along with a
Russian and a Malaysian company.
	   The deal was made despite a U.S. law authorizing President
Clinton to impose sanctions against companies investing more than
dlrs 20 million in Iran's energy sector.
	   ``American laws apply in the United States, not in France,''
said French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.

Holland haunted by new allegations of peacekeeper wrongdoing

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Holland is haunted anew by the
ghosts of a Bosnian massacre.
	   The Serbs are the ones who stand accused of killing thousands of
Muslims in July 1995 and bulldozing their bodies into shallow mass
graves in the northeastern Bosnia enclave of Srebrenica. But it is
the Dutch who are agonizing over the massacre.
	   The Netherlands, its peacekeepers long blamed for failing to
stop some of the Bosnian war's worst atrocities, is scandalized by
new allegations that its soldiers may have gone beyond inaction and
spilled Muslim blood.
	   The Defense Ministry is investigating reports that Dutch U.N.
peacekeepers assigned to protect Srebrenica drove a tank into a
crowd of Muslims, mowing down and killing as many as 30 people. The
military also is probing allegations that it deliberately destroyed
film showing its troops helping Serbs separate Muslim men from
women for deportation.
	   ``What Saigon is for the Americans, Srebrenica is for the Dutch:
a scratch on the people's soul,'' the Dutch newsmagazine HP/De Tijd
said this week.
	   Dutch angst over the affair began early in 1996, when the world
realized an area designated by the United Nations as a ``safe
haven'' for Muslims had actually become a killing field.
	   Criticized by the international community for doing little if
anything to stop the Serb slaughter, Dutch commanders said their
300 troops were outnumbered and outmuscled by the Serbs and
restrained by a weak U.N. mandate forbidding them from engaging in
combat.
	   At first, those denials were enough from the soldiers that the
Dutch had come to think of as heroes.
	   But then four Dutch medics claimed they were ordered not to
treat wounded Muslim civilians. The military denied it.
	   Then the unit's top commander, Lt. Col. Ton Karremans, was
photographed glass in hand with former Serb Gen. Ratko Mladic.
Mladic, indicted for genocide for commanding the siege, remains at
large.
	   Now, with the latest allegations of troops driving a tank
through a crowd of Muslims, the accusations have become a national
obsession. This week, one entertainment magazine broke from its
usual lighthearted fare and printed a large photo of skulls and
bones protruding from a mass grave.
	   ``It's an emotional situation. We have to tread carefully,''
said Defense Minister Frank de Grave. ``I want the facts out in the
open as soon as possible.''
	   Although the U.N. tribunal in The Hague absolved the Dutch unit
of atrocities in 1995, the Dutch military, the state prosecutor and
the Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation are
investigating.
	   Angry ex-peacekeepers, meanwhile, have defended their actions.
	   ``Imagine this scenario: You're blocked by a group of armed
Muslims. Stop? Then you'll be pulled out of your vehicle, disarmed
and probably lynched. Ride through? In a split second that's what
you decide,'' Sgt. Robert van Essen wrote Thursday in a commentary
for the daily Algemeen Dagblad.
	   He ended with a jab at the politicians now demanding a full
accounting: ``Thanks for such wonderful and exemplary support of
the soldiers you sent out.''
	   But the Dutch military's desire to exonerate itself is hampered
by its own recent admission that, from 1991 to 1997, Dutch
peacekeepers in Angola had sexual indiscretions with teen-age women
and tried to smuggle out drugs.
	   Some fear the Dutch will never completely exorcise Srebrenica's
demons.
	   ``It's a horrible story,'' said former Defense Minister Joris
Voorhoeve, who also is implicated in the affair. ``I don't think
we'll ever fully cope with it.''

Taliban says they'll turn over bin Laden if proof of terrorism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Taliban would discuss turning over
Osama bin Laden to U.S. officials if they presented credible
evidence that he was involved in terrorist activity, the Islamic
militia's New York representative said Thursday.
	   Norullah Zadran said the Taliban condemned the U.S. military
strikes on Khost, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) south of the
Afghan capital Kabul, ``in the strongest possible terms.''
	   ``We believe that it violated all the principal norms of
international law and we also believe it was not justified given
the fact that we have not been presented with any kind of evidence
that would indicate the involvement of Mr. bin Laden in any
terrorist activity,'' Zadran said in a telephone interview from his
office in Flushing, New York.
	   The United States suspects groups affiliated with bin Laden were
behind the dual embassy bombings in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania, which killed over 250 people. The Taliban has
allowed bin Laden to live in Afghanistan as a guest.
	   On Thursday, Washington launched cruise missile strikes against
alleged terrorist camps in Afghanistan and a chemical plant in
Sudan both linked to bin Laden in retaliation for the embassy
bombings.
	   ``Our view has been all along,'' Zadran said, ``if we were
presented with credible evidence, some proof that Mr. Osama bin
Laden has been involved with any kind of terrorist activity, we
were willing ... certainly to sit down and discuss it with whomever
presented the evidence.''
	   The Taliban was prepared to defend bin Laden ``as long as he is
innocent,'' Zadran said.

Council says Iraq hasn't met conditions for sanctions relief

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council has extended
punishing trade sanctions on Iraq and expressed its concern about
Baghdad's continued defiance in refusing to cooperate with arms
inspections.
	   Some members of the council have also suggested suspending
future reviews altogether if Iraq doesn't rescind its Aug. 5
decision to halt cooperation, council sources said Thursday,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Such a move would scuttle a critical six-month review scheduled
for October, when Iraq and its backers on the council were expected
to push for easing the measures.
	   Discussions were expected to continue next week, after the U.N.
chief's envoy, Prakash Shah, briefs the council on his recent
failed talks with Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, the
sources said.
	   Iraq announced two weeks ago that it was breaking off
cooperation with the United Nations because the chief weapons
inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that Baghdad had
destroyed its banned weapons.
	   The Security Council will continue the sanctions, imposed in
1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait, until it is convinced that Iraq no
longer has long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons.
	   The sanctions bar air travel to and from the country and regular
exports of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay.
	   Calling Iraq's actions ``totally unacceptable,'' the council
decided Thursday that a regular review of sanctions ``showed that
the necessary conditions do not exist for the modification of the
regime,'' said council president Danilo Turk of Slovenia.
	   Council members ``view with extreme concern the continued
refusal by the government of Iraq to rescind the decision,'' Turk
said.
	   There was widespread consensus before Thursday's meeting that
the council wouldn't make any move toward lifting the measures
because of the current standoff over inspections. On Thursday, Aziz
rejected a written request by Butler to resume cooperation.
	   The council's decision, however, was nevertheless a blow to
Iraq, which has pushed to have the sanctions lifted because it
claims it has complied with resolutions that it destroy its banned
weapons.
	   Thursday's decision is ``an important step in saying to Iraq
that because of your actions, your violation of Security Council
resolutions, your repudiating the secretary-general's agreement
with you, that sanctions are going to remain,'' said America's U.N.
ambassador, Bill Richardson.
	   To break the standoff, China wants the council to talk directly
with Iraq, ``including inviting some officials or delegations from
the Iraq side'' to meet at the United Nations, said Shen Guofang,
China's deputy ambassador.
	   In an opinion piece Thursday in The New York Times, Iraq's U.N.
ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said Iraq will never be able to satisfy
inspectors because they are asking Iraq to prove a negative _ that
it doesn't have banned weapons.
	   ``The inspectors are searching for a black cat in a dark room,
where the cat does not exist,'' Hamdoon wrote.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with company confirming it will file for bankruptcy,
ADDS background; Okura and Co. takes an ampersand &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Okura and Co., a Japanese trader that recently
announced it was facing a cash-flow crisis, will file for
bankruptcy Friday, a company official said.
	   Executives of the 87-year-old company will hold a press
conference later Friday, the company official said without
providing other details.
	   Okura, which specializing in trading steel and machinery, has
liabilities estimated at about 300 billion yen (dlrs 2.1 billion),
Japan's leading financial daily, the Nihon Keizai, reported Friday
morning.
	   The news of the latest business failure comes as Japanese
corporate bankruptcies are rising at their fastest pace since the
end of World War II, fueled by a recession and shrinking access to
credit.
	   The Tokyo Stock Exchange temporarily suspended trading in the
company's shares Friday as the market awaited Okura's announcement.
The company's shares are traded on the First Section of the Tokyo
Stock Exchange.
	   Earlier this month Okura announced a plan to boost its capital
with a 10 billion yen (dlrs 69.9 million) injection from major
shareholders.
	   The company said it had suffered a cash shortage of several
billion yen (tens of million of dollars) in July after a company to
which Okura planned to sell or lease aircraft didn't make payments.
	   Okura asked major steelmakers to accept delays in payments, but
some refused and stopped supplying steel products to Okura, they
said.
	   Fuji Bank Ltd., one of Okura's main lenders, said Friday that it
has extended 38 billion yen (dlrs 266 million) in loans to Okura,
of which 15 billion yen (dlrs 105 million) to 20 billion yen (dlrs
140 million) may be irrecoverable.

Agassi advances to quarterfinals, but just barely
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Andre Agassi battled Wayne Black of Zimbabwe
for nearly two hours Thursday before advancing to the quarterfinal
round of the RCA Championships with a 7-6 (7-4), 3-6, 6-1 victory.
	   Agassi, who needed just 43 minutes to win his second-round match
Wednesday, meets South African Wayne Ferreira in Friday's
quarterfinals.
	   Ferreira also struggled before turning away an upset bid by
Australia's Jason Stoltenberg, winning 3-6, 7-5, 7-6 (12-10).
Stoltenberg, who ousted defending champion Jonas Bjorkman on
Wednesday, battled Ferreira for 2{ hours.
	   ``He played well,'' Agassi said of Black. ``It was tough
conditions out there, with the shadows for the first two sets. It
was hard to pick up the ball cleanly, and I didn't feel like I was
executing my shots. Any time I don't see the ball well, I don't
move quite well.''
	   Agassi appeared to be on his way to another blowout in the first
set, breaking Black in the second game and taking a 3-1 lead. He
was serving at 40-love in Game 5 when Black battled back to win
that game. They were on even terms after that.
	   The second set was dominated by the respective servers until
Black broke Agassi in the eighth game, then held service in the
ninth. The third set was closer than the final score indicated. The
second game went to deuce three times before Black won, the fifth
game went to deuce five times before Agassi won for a 4-1 lead,
Agassi broke Black in Game 6 after going to deuce once, and the
last game went to deuce twice before Agassi closed out Black with
consecutive aces.
	   ``By the time the third (set) came around, it was pretty even,''
Agassi said of the shadows moving all the way across the court. ``I
could hit some bigger shots, but it was still just one of those
days I had to fight through and get through.''
	   Also advancing was third-seeded Greg Rusedski of Great Britain.
He defeated 13th-seeded Francisco Clavet of Spain, 6-1, 7-6 (8-6).
	   Top-ranked Marcelo Rios of Chile was set to play Byron Black,
Wayne Black's brother, in a night match Thursday.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ They helped win a war against Soviet troops
in Afghanistan. Their exploits were celebrated across the Muslim
world. Now, in a rain of bombs on two continents, this
battle-hardened, devout corps, an ``Islamic International,'' has
become the No. 1 target of the world's No. 1 power.
	   These Arab veterans of the 1980s Afghan war transformed their
old crusade in recent years into a new one against ``illegitimate''
Arab rulers, against an Israel that occupies Muslim land, against
an America that supports both.
	   It was an attack against America, the deadly U.S. embassy
bombings in Africa on Aug. 7, that led to U.S. air strikes Thursday
against locations in Afghanistan and Sudan linked to followers of
one of the leading ``Arab Afghans,'' Osama bin Laden, an exiled
Saudi millionaire.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said bin Laden's followers were
believed to have played a ``key role'' in the embassy bloodshed.
	   These militants are a small cluster of as many as 25,000 Arabs
and other Muslims who left home to fight in Afghanistan. But their
campaign, both in its bloodshed and fervor, may help define the
1990s. Their paramilitary skills, growing sophistication and ample
finance set them apart from an earlier generation.
	   An eclectic group, the Arab Afghans bombed the World Trade
Center in New York in 1993 and the Egyptian Embassy in Pakistan two
years later. They are suspected of attacking U.S.-run facilities in
Saudi Arabia. They tried to kill Egypt's president in Ethiopia. And
they have fought in wars and insurgencies in some of the world's
most troubled spots _ Bosnia, Chechnya, Kashmir and Tajikistan.
	   Now, in the wake of the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania,
which killed 257 people, a group of those Arab Afghans has sent
another stark message: Their war has just begun.
	   ``Strikes will continue from everywhere, and Islamic groups will
appear one after the other to fight American interests,'' said a
statement last week from the World Islamic Front for Jihad Against
Jews and Crusaders, a group formed in February.
	   The group stopped short of claiming responsibility, but its
message was sent to Al-Hayat, the Arab world's leading newspaper,
with several statements from a little-known group that did. Many
Arab experts believe they may be one and the same.
	   From the Arab Afghan ranks have emerged some of the militants
Arab governments and others consider the most dangerous today.
	   They are Egyptians, Saudis, Algerians, among other
nationalities, and they cross porous borders with false passports _
Egyptian, Sudanese, Yemeni, even European. And their international
sophistication has grown.
	   Islamic revolutionaries once passed hand to hand the simple
cassettes of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's speeches during the
Iranian revolution. Now, groups of Arab Afghans _ Egypt's Islamic
Group, for instance _ design sleek, colorful web sites that market
their fiery messages and offer an e-mail address in Europe, long a
refuge for militant leaders fleeing death sentences at home.
	   ``The majority come from universities, they're modern and they
use modern methods. Americans imagine these people come from the
Middle Ages and that's not true,'' said Diaa Rashwan, an analyst at
Egypt's Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies.
	   Osama bin Laden stands as perhaps the most notorious of the new
generation of Islamic militant.
	   Like thousands of other Saudis of his generation, he journeyed
to Afghanistan soon after the 1979 Soviet invasion of that poor
Muslim nation in central Asia, joining activists who would later
form the nucleus of militant Islam, in such groups as Hamas,
Egypt's Islamic Group, Algeria's Islamic Salvation Front and the
Moro Liberation Front in the Philippines.
	   The war was heavily financed by an estimated dlrs 3 billion from
America, the biggest covert operation since the Vietnam War.
	   To Americans, it was a fight against Soviet aggression. To pious
Arabs, it was a sacred fight against an atheist ideology _ a
conflict redolent of the international pilgrimage of leftists in
the 1930s to fight fascism during the Spanish Civil War.
	   ``It was very romantic, it was everybody's cause. There was so
much poetry about the crusade in Afghanistan,'' recalled Jamal
Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist who covered the war.
	   Bin Laden soon emerged as one of that war's greatest heroes.
	   Scion of one of Saudi Arabia's richest families, he gave up a
life of plenty to bring in the bulldozers that cut the tunnels and
roads along which the guerrillas trekked. His bravery on the
battlefield soon became legendary.

	   After the war, stripped of his citizenship by a Saudi government
fearful of his militant Islam, bin Laden made his way to Sudan,
protected by Hassan al-Turabi, that country's Islamic ideologue.
	   Western pressure forced him to leave Sudan in 1995 and return to
Afghanistan, where he has resided since.
	   But his money, a fortune estimated at dlrs 300 million, has
continued to support a vast network. Mustafa Hamza, an Egyptian
wanted in the attempt in 1995 on Egypt's president, was reported to
be running a company owned by bin Laden in Somalia.
	   The contacts he forged remain loyal, too. One of them is Ayman
al-Zawahri, a doctor and Afghanistan veteran who heads Egypt's
Jihad group, which assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in
1981. With bin Laden and others, he founded the group that warned
of more attacks last week.
	   Such alliances _ Egyptian militants and bin Laden's followers _
could have sweeping repercussions, analysts say.
	   For years, Egyptian militant groups _ Jihad and the Islamic
Group _ fought the government on its own turf. The Islamic Group
was responsible for a simmering insurgency in southern Egypt. Jihad
was notorious for high-profile assassination attempts in Cairo.
	   As the government turned the corner in the battle in 1995, with
a brutal crackdown in which security forces bulldozed houses,
clamped curfews on restive villages and detained thousands, the
militants took the fight abroad. It became a ``dirty war,'' pitting
government against Arab Afghan, that crossed three continents:
	   _ Talaat Fouad Qassem, the Islamic Group's spokesman abroad,
vanished in Croatia in September 1995. His wife said he was
abducted to Egypt and killed. His group claimed responsibility for
a car bombing the following month in Croatia.
	   _ A car bomb ripped through the Egyptian Embassy in Pakistan in
November 1995, killing 17 people. The bombing followed Pakistan's
extradition of several Arab Afghans.
	   _ Since June, at least five Egyptians were arrested in Albania.
Albanian officials said they were deported to Egypt with the help
of U.S. authorities. A day before the Africa bombings, Jihad vowed
revenge against the United States for its role.
	   ``These governments have embroiled themselves in a war,'' said
Azam Tamimi, an Islamic activist in London. ``A desperate person, a
person who will be killed or extradited, is capable of anything.''
	   Pakistani officials now say it was an Egyptian _ a Zawahri
loyalist who worked with bin Laden _ who planned the Africa
bombings.
	   That cooperation marks ``a new stage, a new period, a new phase
of action, from the state as their enemy to the United States and
Israel as their enemy,'' said Rashwan, the Egyptian analyst.
	   Or, as the Jihad coalition put it, ``God willing, America will
face a black fate similar to that of the Soviet Union.''

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police have appealed for public
help in identifying two men spotted parking the car carrying a bomb
that killed 28 people and wounded more than 330 last weekend.
	   But police also freed three of the five men who had been
arrested Monday as part of the effort to track down the Irish
Republican Army dissidents responsible for Saturday's blast, the
deadliest terrorist attack since the Northern Ireland conflict
began in 1969.
	   Under British anti-terrorist law, the two remaining suspects can
be held for up to a week before being released or charged.
	   The police moves came after three days of funerals for all the
civilians _ two infant girls, nine teen-agers, 12 women and five
men, Protestant and Catholic alike _ slain Saturday.
	   The dissidents, called the Real IRA because of their refusal to
adhere to the parent organization's July 1997 truce, have insisted
they didn't mean to cause a massacre, despite giving misleading
phoned warnings. On Wednesday a spokesman, using a recognized
codeword, announced that the group would ``suspend'' its car-bomb
attacks on Northern Ireland towns in response to the public outcry.
	   The Irish government has announced plans to strengthen its
anti-terrorist legislation to restrict the right to bail, to detain
suspects for up to 96 hours' questioning, and to convict people of
belonging to paramilitary groups based on the testimony of a senior
detective. It expects lawmakers to reconvene in two weeks to pass
the package.
	   The leaders of the four main churches in Northern Ireland _
Catholic, Presbyterian, Anglican and Methodist _ have organized a
prayer vigil in Omagh on Saturday and a minute's silence that they
hope will be observed in both parts of Ireland at 3:10 p.m.
(1410GMT), one week to the minute after the bomb detonated.
	   Peace activists in Dundalk, a town in the Irish Republic that
borders Northern Ireland, are planning to march Friday night from a
cathedral to the central square to protest against Real IRA members
and supporters believed to live in the town 50 miles (80
kilometers) south of Belfast.
	   One focus of the Dundalk protest is the man Irish police have
identified as the Real IRA's commander, Michael ``Mickey''
McKevitt, and his common-law wife, Bernadette Sands-McKevitt.
	   Sands-McKevitt is the sister of the late IRA prison
hunger-strike leader, Bobby Sands. She helped found a legal
pressure group called the 32 County Sovereignty Movement in
response to the IRA's decision to pursue negotiations through its
Sinn Fein party allies.
	   She has criticized the multi-party agreement struck in Belfast
in April as certain to perpetuate violence, because it didn't
achieve the traditional IRA goal of abolishing Northern Ireland as
a Protestant-majority state linked with Britain.
	   A report in The Scotsman newspaper of Edinburgh said she
answered their front door in Dundalk's middle-class suburb of
Blackrock on Wednesday to deny this.
	   ``They've got the wrong people and I know they are trying to set
us up and you have to ask why,'' she was quoted by the newspaper as
saying.

	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ All Blacks loose forward Isitolo
Maka has been forced out of New Zealand's squad for the Bledisloe
Cup rugby union match against Australia on Aug. 29.
	   Maka suffered facial injuries in last week's loss to South
Africa and tests show he is still suffering moderate concussion.
	   ``Losing Isitolo is most unfortunate for him and for the All
Blacks at a time when we are looking to build on our Durban
performance where he played so strongly,'' coach John Hart said.
	   The All Blacks assemble in Auckland on Monday and departs for
Sydney on Wednesday. Australia holds a winning 2-0 lead in the
three-match series.

Protesters storm U.S. Embassy compound after attack on factory

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Angry Sudanese stormed the empty U.S.
Embassy compound in Khartoum early Friday and pulled down the
American flag to protest a U.S. missile attack on a pharmaceutical
plant in the Sudanese capital.
	   Sudanese government officials termed the missile attack ``a
criminal act'' and charged that it had been ordered by President
Clinton to draw attention away from his troubles in the Monica
Lewinsky sex scandal.
	   They said at least seven workers at the factory were injured in
the Thursday night attack and that some workers still were
unaccounted for and could be beneath the rubble.
	   Hours later, state-run Sudan Television showed scores of people
scaling the wrought-iron fence around the embassy in the heart of
the capital.
	   Hundreds more outside the fence threw stones at the building or
beat the fence with sticks.
	   They shouted ``Allahu Akbar,'' the Muslim rally cry meaning
``God is Great,'' and ``Down, Down USA'' in English.
	   The protesters pulled down the embassy flag and dragged it on
the ground.
	   It was unclear from the TV footage if they got inside the locked
building, and there was no footage to indicate if the mob remained
inside the compound or was dispersed by police.
	   The State Department ordered local staff to leave the the
embassy after the Aug. 7 bombings of embassies in Nairobi, Kenya,
and Dar es-Salaam.
	   American diplomats were pulled out of Khartoum in 1996 after
Washington said it could no longer guarantee their security.
Diplomats stationed in Cairo and in Nairobi visit Khartoum
periodically to provide consular services.
	   Clinton ordered the attack on the factory in Khartoum in
retaliation for the Aug. 7 bombings of the American embassies in
East Africa. U.S. missiles also struck suspected camps of Muslim
militant Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said in Washington that the
factory in Khartoum had been targeted as a suspected chemical
weapons site.
	   Sudan's president, Omar el-Bashir, called on Sudanese to protest
the attack Friday and said he would seek a U.N. investigation into
what the plant produced.
	   ``Sudanese people will defend themselves,'' el-Bashir told
state-run television in a broadcast monitored in Cairo.
	   Sudan's information minister, Ghazi Salah-Eddin, also denied the
weapons allegation, saying the factory produced ``cheap medicines
... for the diseases found in Sudan.''
	   He said the El-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co. was hit by
five missiles at 7:15 p.m. (1715 gmt) Thursday and that ``the
destruction is total.''
	   He called it ``a criminal act'' and accused the Clinton
administration of trying to draw public attention from the Lewinsky
case.
	   ``They want to distract the American people,'' Salah-Eddin said.
	   Mohammed al-Amin, head of the political committee of the
National Congress, which is a grass-roots citizens' advisory body,
called on the United Nations to send a team to investigate the
incident and urged a ``general mobilization'' for the Sudanese
army.
	   In Cairo, airport officials said that a German passenger jet en
route to Khartoum from Frankfurt was ordered back to Cairo by its
headquarters after the U.S. missile strike. The officials, speaking
on customary condition of anonymity, said there were 96 passengers
aboard.
	   A number of Sudan's allies spoke out in its defense.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi telephoned el-Bashir and
``condemned the unjust aggression,'' the television said. State-run
Iraq television accused the United States used ``systematic
international terrorism.''
	   Earlier this year, the American magazine U.S. News and World
Report quoted a secret congressional report as saying Iraq had
built chemical weapons plants in Sudan. This was never publicly
confirmed by U.S. officials.
	   Last December, a Sudanese opposition group charged in a
statement faxed to The Associated Press in Cairo that the Sudanese
government was making chemical weapons in Khartoum and two other
cities and using them in its war against southern rebels.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ While Kenyans were still burying their
dead, the U.S. military hit suspected terrorist sites in Sudan and
Afghanistan that President Bill Clinton linked to the embassy
bombings in East Africa.
	   Hours earlier, FBI Director Louis Freeh toured the wreckage of
the embassy in Tanzania with FBI agents and local officials before
traveling to Nairobi on Thursday.
	   Nearly simultaneous bomb attacks killed 257 people on Aug. 7 at
U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. More
than 5,500 people were injured, mostly Kenyans.
	   Clinton and defense officials said the facilities attacked
Thursday by the United States had ties to Osama bin Laden, a Saudi
millionaire whom U.S. officials call a major sponsor of terrorism.
	   An Egyptian Islamic militant linked to bin Laden has been
identified by one suspect as having planned the embassy bombings, a
senior Pakistani official said Thursday on condition of anonymity.
Bin Laden has denied involvement in the bombings.
	   The suspect, named by U.S. and Kenyan officials as Mohammed
Saddiq Odeh, said the operation began in July under the direction
of a man he called Ali Saleh, a member of the Egyptian Islamic
Jihad group.
	   Saleh led bin Laden's terrorist group in Africa, the Pakistani
source said. The Saudi millionaire has called on Muslims to attack
American installations.
	   Police in Cairo said Saleh's name was not known to them.
	   Odeh also said the main conspirators left before explosions,
leaving behind hired Kenyans and Tanzanians to carry out the car
bombings, the source said.
	   Kenyan and Tanzanian police could not confirm the reports.
	   ``We haven't made any conclusions that anybody being held here
is connected at this point to the bombing,'' Freeh said, referring
to two suspects detained in Tanzania. Their names and nationalities
have not been released.
	   Kenyan police said last week they were holding ``about five
people'' in their investigation.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Chris Scharf said Freeh's schedule for
Friday, including plans to visit the bombing site in Nairobi and
have a new conference may be canceled as a result of the U.S.
military actions.
	   In Nairobi, the Kenyan husband of Jean Dalizu, the 12th American
killed in the Kenya bombing remembered her at a private memorial
service and prepared to bury her in a village 280 kilometers (175
miles) west of the capital.
	   Nearby, thousands wearing red ribbons as a sign of mourning
gathered for a public memorial service on a grassy hill in downtown
Uhuru Park.
	   President Daniel arap Moi pledged to work closely with U.S.
officials to track down the terrorists. ``The government will not
allow Kenyans to be victims of these inhumane criminals,'' he said.
	   U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell, wearing a white sash symbolic
of mourning in Kenya, promised America would help East Africans
through this difficult time.
	   ``Together we will dispel the shadows of darkness, emerge from
the veils of grief, and create a brighter tomorrow,'' she said.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ President Alberto Fujimori removed powerful
armed forces chief Gen. Nicolas Hermoza from his post Thursday in
the wake off a tense military standoff with Ecuador.
	   As Hermoza left the presidential palace in Lima, he shook hands
with Fujimori and top military brass, but did not speak to
reporters.
	   Hermoza, 63, had held the post for seven years. He will be
replaced by Defense Minister Gen. Cesar Saucedo, the government
said.
	   The decision came a week after Fujimori negotiated a peaceful
end to a standoff in a remote border region where Peru and Ecuador
fought a brief war in 1995.
	   The president's office denied that Hermoza was removed because
of the conflict with Ecuador.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Armed men on horseback held up two buses on a
southwestern Mexican highway Thursday, robbing more than 50
passengers and raping four young women, the government news agency
reported.
	   The six men set up rocks in the road, forcing the buses to stop,
prosecutor Jesus Aleman del Carmen told Notimex. The buses had left
Altamirano, 110 miles southwest of Mexico City, early Thursday en
route to the resort city of Acapulco.
	   Aleman said the attackers robbed the 32 passengers of the first
bus they stopped, then robbed 25 people on the second bus. They
also pulled four women ages 19 and 20 from the second bus and raped
them, he said.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican scientists hope items found near
recently discovered cave drawings will reveal who painted the
images, believed to be the largest group of prehistoric petroglyphs
on the continent, a report published Thursday said.
	   The drawings of several figures, which appear to be humans
standing with their arms outstretched, were found in recent months
in the southern mountains of the Baja California Peninsula, the
daily El Universal said.
	   Researchers from Mexico, the United States and Europe have been
called in to study the drawings, believed to be about 3,000 years
old.
	   Jorge Manriquez, regional director for the National Institute of
Anthropology and History, said a bag and utensils that possibly
were paint brushes are being analyzed for information on the origin
of the paintings.
	   The drawings are one of the few clues scientists have about
early settlers of the arid peninsula, the report said.
	   ___
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ The leader of Colombia's largest rebel
group has offered to swap more than 200 captured soldiers and
police for guerrillas held in government jails, authorities said
Thursday.
	   The proposal from Manuel Marulanda of the 15,000-member
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia was delivered Wednesday to
the president of congress, said legislator Fabio Valencia.
	   Valencia said he forwarded the document to President Andres
Pastrana, who met with Marulanda in Colombian jungles last month
and has vowed to begin peace talks with the group by November.
	   Government officials did not comment on the proposal, which
rebels described as a humanitarian gesture to improve the climate
for peace.
	   The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the 5,000-member
National Liberation Army have been fighting the government since
the 1960s and have gained militarily during the past year over a
dispirited army.
	   ___
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A judge whose identity was kept secret
has sentenced a man to 20 years in prison for taking part in the
1990 abductions chronicled in Gabriel Garcia Marquez's ``News of a
Kidnapping.''
	   Juan Carlos Rodriguez had appealed his conviction as a middleman
in the kidnappings of socialite Marina Montoya, journalist Maruja
Pachon and her sister-in-law Beatriz Villamizar, ordered by the
late Medellin drug lord Pablo Escobar.
	   Escobar, who waged a long terrorist campaign against the
government before being killed by police in 1993, sought to barter
the hostages for a promise that Colombian officials would not
extradite drug traffickers to the United States.
	   Montoya was murdered by her captors in January 1991. Escobar
freed the other two women along with several male hostages in 1991
before turning himself over to authorities. He escaped from jail in
1992 and died the following year.
	   ___
	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _ A 24-hour strike by the Bolivian Workers
Confederation to demand higher wages shut down public hospitals and
schools Thursday.
	   The strike also was called to show the group's support for coca
leaf farmers who are marching towards the capital, La Paz.
	   The Workers' Confederation, which represents most of the
country's labor unions, had urged all public sector workers to
honor the general strike but only teachers and health workers
joined the walkout.
	   About 500 farmers, including women and children, began marching
two weeks ago from Villa Tunari, a tropical town almost 500 miles
from La Paz at the edge of the country's coca and cocaine producing
region.
	   Interior Minister Guido Nayar said the march was funded and
supported by cocaine traffickers and said the government would not
interfere unless violence broke out.
	   ___
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ The U.S. consulate in Rio de
Janeiro received its second telephoned bomb threat in less than
week on Thursday, forcing the building's evacuation, local media
reported.
	   The consulate's own bomb squad combed the building but found
nothing. Employees went back to work about an hour later, the O
Globo newspaper said.
	   Neither consulate officials nor police were available for
immediate comment.
	   A similar threat, received at the consulate Aug. 14, was also a
hoax.
	   Security has been stepped up at U.S. embassies and consulates
around the world in the wake of the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania,
which killed at least 257 people.
	   ___
	   CANCUN, Mexico (AP) _ A judge on Thursday freed two of three
California men accused of using a yacht to smuggle assault rifles,
but ordered the yacht's captain held for trial.
	   Judge Fidel Villanueva said Scott D. McClung, 36, committed a
serious violation of Mexican maritime law by carrying three AR-15
semiautomatic rifles and two shotguns without a permit.
	   But he ordered the release of first mate Noah Bailey and
McClung's father, Eugene McClung Jr., owner of Laguna Beach,
Calif., -based Certified Marine Expeditions. Villanueva ruled that
only the captain was responsible for the violations.
	   The 150-foot Rapture was sailing from Florida to Newport Beach,
Calif., when technical problems forced it to stop Aug. 10 in
Cozumel, a tourist island in the Gulf of Mexico. The yacht's acting
captain, Paul Holaday, has claimed that the crew showed the guns to
authorities, but the authorities later accused them of trying to
hide the weapons.
	   ___
	   TUXTLA GUTIERREZ, Mexico (AP) _ Arrest warrants have been issued
for 193 people suspected in clashes in the southern state of
Chiapas that led up to and followed the massacre of 45 people in
the Indian village of Acteal.
	   At a news conference Thursday, Deputy Attorney General Jose Luis
Ramos Rivera did not say if most of the suspects were supporters of
the government or those of the Zapatista rebels, who staged a brief
uprising in January 1994 in the name of Indian rights and greater
democracy.
	   The two sides have frequently fought, culminating in Dec. 22
massacre of unarmed civilians in Acteal, a village of Zapatistas
supporters. Pro-government paramilitaries have been blamed.
	   Ramos Rivera said 125 people have been arrested in connection
with the massacre and another 10 suspects are at large.
	   None of the massacre suspects are among the 193 now being sought
by authorities. All 193 were at large as of Thursday afternoon.
	   About 25 people were killed in 34 incidents in the weeks before
and after the Acteal massacre. Ramos Rivera said investigations
into the violence are continuing.

Graf loses in du Maurier

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with night matches postponed &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Steffi Graf, who dominated women's tennis before
injuries proved her downfall, was upset by Spain's Magui Serna 6-4,
6-4 Thursday in the third round of the dlrs 1.3-million du Maurier
Open.
	   ``I have no consistency in my game at all right now,'' said the
dejected Graf, the former world No. 1 who has battled injuries the
last two years. ``At the end, I was just trying to get the ball in
the court. I had no feel at all.
	   ``It has a lot to do with confidence. I'm not secure with my
shots right now. I'm tentative.''
	   Serna had a match point serving at 5-3 but Graf fought it off,
then won her own serve. Graf saved three more match points on
Serna's serve before losing after the game had gone to its third
deuce.
	   The end came after Graf hit a backhand just long and Serna fired
an ace down the middle.
	   Serna is ranked No. 26 in the world to No. 41 for Graf, who is
attempting a comeback from a knee injury.
	   Meanwhile, top-seeded Martina Hingis made a lot of errors, but
still beat Japan's Ai Sugiyama 6-3, 6-0 to reach the quarterfinals.
	   ``I had a great year last year but it's tough doing it again,''
said Hingis, adding that the problem with being No. 1 is ``you
can't get better. There's nothing you can do but try to win.''
	   Second-seeded Jana Novotna and fifth-seeded Monica Seles also
reached the quarterfinals with straight-set victories.
	   Nathalie Tauziat of France led French Open champion Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario of Spain 4-3 in the first set of their evening
match, which was delayed more than three hours by rain and then was
postponed after 24 minutes of play.
	   A third-round match between Anna Kournikova of Russia and
sixth-seeded Conchita Martinez of Spain didn't get started and the
Irena Spirlea-Sandrine Testud match was postponed at 6-6 in the
first set.

Sampras, Rafter, Korda ousted as top seeds fall in Pilot Pen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Korda-Ulihrach final &QL;

<TEXT>
	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ Pete Sampras, Patrick Rafter and
Petr Korda, the top three seeds at the Pilot Pen International, all
made a third-round exit.
	   Sampras, the reigning Wimbledon champ, lost 6-3, 6-4 to
qualifier Leander Paes of India, Frenchman Guillaume Raoux ousted
U.S. Open defending champion Rafter 7-6 (10-8), 6-3, and Bohdan
Ulihrach of the Czech Republic beat Korda 7-6 (8-6), 6-3.
	   Rafter beat Sampras his last two tournaments, said he
also felt drained.
	   ``You can lose to anyone any given day,'' said Rafter, the
tournament's No. 2 seed and the third-ranked player in the world.
	   The losses will help Chile's Marcel Rios hold onto his No. 1
world ranking if he makes it to the semifinals this week in
Indianapolis. If he does not, Sampras returns to the top spot from
his current No. 2 ranking.
	   Paes, a doubles specialist ranked 100th in the world in singles,
saved five break points in the 74-minute match. He ran Sampras all
over the court and used his quick feet and net skills to play a
dominating serve-and-volley game. Paes also out-aced Sampras 7-4.
	   The win was Paes' first against a player ranked in the top five
of the ATP Tour. Paes, who won the Pilot Pen doubles title last
year with Mahesh Bhupathi, said his strategy was to ``chip and
charge'' and get to the net.
	   ``I think that he served under-par today, and that allowed me to
get to the net,'' said Paes.
	   ``My main thing was to take the match to him. If you let Pete
Sampras dictate the match, you pretty much have no chance,'' he
said.
	   It was somewhat of a bittersweet day for Paes. Hours after the
Sampras match, Paes and Bhupathi lost their second-round match to
Australians Wayne Arthurs and Peter Tramacchi.
	   ``I am a little down right now,'' he said after losing the title
defense.
	   Raoux, the tournament's No. 16 seed, is ranked 48th in the
world. He used a strong baseline game, consistently passing Rafter
at the net and effectively stopping Rafter from volleying sharply.
	   ``He was really too good for me today,'' said Rafter, who
dropped a 4-1 lead in the tiebreaker. ``There was no way to really
penetrate him.''
	   Raoux said Rafter seemed focused on defending his U.S. Open
title.
	   ``My coach said, `He has to take a break before the U.S. Open,
why not today?''' he said.
	   The Ulihrach-Korda match was the third meeting between the two,
but the first since 1996. Going into Thursday's match, Korda had
2-0 edge, beating his countryman on both clay and hardcourt.
Ulihrach advances to play defending Pilot Pen champ Yevgeny
Kafelnikov.
	   Kafelnikov beat Gustavo Kuerten 6-4, 6-4, in part by avoiding
the Brazilian's powerful backhand.
	   Kafelnikov had won the French Open in 1996 and lost last year to
Kuerten in Paris when he took away the clay court title.
	   ``I'm glad I'm still on a roll, we'll see what happens,''
Kafelnikov said.

New Zealand expresses understanding over U.S. missile attacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ The United States had the right
to defend its citizens against terrorist actions, New Zealand said
Friday in response to U.S. missile attacks on alleged terrorist
sites in Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said that terrorist bombings this
month of U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania, ``show that terrorism is an indiscriminate killer of
innocent people.''
	   Retaliating 13 days after the deadly embassy bombings in East
Africa, U.S. forces Thursday launched cruise missile strikes
against alleged terrorist camps in Afghanistan and a chemical plant
in Sudan.
	   ``Countries have the right to defend themselves and their
citizens against terrorism and New Zealand appreciates and
understands the steps the United States has taken,'' McKinnon said.
	   The embassy bombings, on Aug. 7, killed 247 people in Kenya and
10 in Tanzania. More than 5,500 people were injured, mostly
Kenyans.
	   McKinnon's spokeswoman said the United States had ``very good
intelligence'' linking the sites struck overnight with the embassy
attacks.

Fatigue may have led to fatal crash on Alaska Highway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WHITEHORSE, Yukon (AP) _ Driver fatigue may have contributed to
the deaths of five people after a minivan collided with a motorhome
on the Alaska Highway south of Haines Junction.
	   Four of those killed were German tourists riding in a westbound
Alaska-registered minivan.
	   Cpl. Larry Kavanagh of the Haines Junction Royal Canadian
Mounted Police said Thursday that the minivan struck the gravel
shoulder of the right side of the highway, overcorrected and
collided with the oncoming motorhome.
	   It's possible minivan driver may have fallen asleep, Kavanagh
said.
	   The European tourists were pronounced dead at the scene. The
driver of the motorhome, Ruby Stout, 52, of Texarkana, Texas, died
on the way to Whitehorse General Hospital.
	   Police identified the minivan's occupants as driver Klaus-Dieter
Damm, 53; Hans Gerspacher, 60; Heide Gerspacher, 50; and Edelgart
Damm, 51, all of Germany.
	   Stout's husband, William, her 9-year-old grandson William Jr.
and aunt, Pearl McBride, 54, were also in the motorhome at the time
of the accident.
	   McBride still is in the hospital here in Whitehorse and is
listed in serious condition.
	   The grandson and husband were released Wednesday night.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Religious leaders in Pakistan said
they would offer special prayers and lead demonstrations against
U.S. attacks in the fellow Islamic nations of Afghanistan and
Sudan.
	   ``We won't allow this incident go by unnoticed. It is time for
the Muslims of the world to unite,'' said Munaar Hasan, general
secretary of the right-wing Jamiat-e-Islami, a political and
religious group that has vowed to transform Pakistan into a strict
Islamic state.
	   Hasan said Thursday the call would go out from mosques on
Friday, the Muslim holy day, for the faithful to stage
demonstrations in the major cities of Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi
following prayers.
	   A spokesman for Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, the key ally in Pakistan
of Afghanistan's hard-line Taliban rulers, said he was shocked by
the U.S. attack and expected angry reactions across Pakistan
Friday.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said Thursday he ordered strikes on
targets linked to Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan
and Sudan after determining the sites were linked to those
responsible for the bombings of U.S. embassies in eastern Africa.
The Aug. 7 bombings in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania,
killed 257 people and injured more than 5,500. The United States
has called bin Laden a major sponsor of terrorism around the world.
	   ``America itself has emerged as a big terrorist state by
attacking two independent and free countries,'' Hasan said, adding
Pakistan's government ``will be held accountable'' if it had
facilitated the U.S. action.
	   Pakistani officials have said repeatedly in recent days that the
United States had not approached them about attacking bin Laden,
and defense officials said Thursday they were taken by surprise
when U.S. warplanes flew across Pakistani airspace to launch cruise
missiles on Afghan sites.
	   Though the Pakistani government is a U.S. ally, a vocal minority
in the officially Islamic country often portrays the United States
as an enemy of Islam.
	   Large anti-American demonstrations took place in Pakistan during
the Gulf War in 1991, when the United States attacked the Islamic
state of Iraq. Last year, four U.S. employees of Houston-based
energy company Union Texas were shot dead in Karachi. The slayings
came after a Pakistani who had been arrested in Pakistan by U.S.
FBI agents was convicted in the shooting deaths of CIA agents.
	   The United States evacuated most of its diplomatic staff in
Pakistan earlier this week and strongly urged other Americans to
leave as well. It also advised foreign aid workers in Afghanistan
to leave.

Dollar edges higher, Tokyo stock prices slip in morning trading

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose slightly against the yen
Friday morning on news of U.S. air strikes against suspected
terrorist targets. Tokyo stock prices fell moderately.
	   The dollar bought 142.82 yen in late morning trading, up 0.27
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but lower than its late New York
rate of 143.19 yen overnight.
	   Traders also attributed the dollar's strength to a belief among
investors that Japan's efforts to reorganize the nation's ailing
financial system may take more time than expected.
	   But lingering speculation that Japan would intervene in currency
markets to support the yen if it falls further weighed on the
dollar, traders said.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton announced Thursday he ordered cruise
missile attacks on sites in Afghanistan and Sudan linked to Osama
bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire whom U.S. officials call a major
sponsor of terrorism.
	   The attacks were in response to the August 7 bombings at the
U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania,
which killed 257 people and injured more than 5,500 people.
	   The U.S. currency is regarded as a safe haven in times of
international unrest.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average shed 100.55 points, or 0.65 points, to close the
morning session at 15,290.86 points. On Thursday, the average fell
14.93 points, or 0.10 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange slipped 8.05 points, or 0.68 percent,
to 1,173.62. The TOPIX closed down 2.04 points, or 0.17 percent,
the day before.
	   Stocks started lower following an overnight drop on Wall Street
and news that medium-sized Japanese trading firm Okura and Co. was
to file for bankruptcy.
	   The Nihon Keizai financial daily reported Friday morning that
Okura had total liabilities of about 300 billion yen (U.S. dlrs 2.1
billion).
	   The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 8,611.41 on Thursday,
down 81.87 from Wednesday's finish.
	   In Tokyo, shares of ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan rose
to 65 yen (45 U.S. cents) in early trading, up 9 yen (6 cents), on
reports that drastic restructuring measures for the bank were being
mapped out.
	   In the fixed-income security market, the yield on the benchmark
No. 182 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.175 percent from
1.190 percent Thursday, driving its price up to 111.91 yen from
111.80 yen.

McGwire hits 50th homer as Cardinals down Mets 2-0
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Mets-Cardinals opener; will be updated with late
games &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Mark McGwire became the first player in U.S.
Major League Baseball history to hit 50 home runs in three
consecutive seasons Thursday night with a towering shot in the
seventh inning of the first game of a doubleheader between the St.
Louis Cardinals and New York Mets.
	   After Brian Jordan led off the seventh with a homer off Willie
Blair, McGwire sent a 2-1 pitch over the wall in left-center.
McGwire, who hit Nos. 48 and 49 on Wednesday, pumped his right fist
above his head as he rounded first base as the large Shea Stadium
crowd gave him a standing ovation.
	   Only Babe Ruth (1920-21 and 1927-28) and McGwire had hit 50 or
more homers in back-to-back seasons before McGwire's 369-foot shot,
which fell in between the outfield wall and the bleachers.
	   McGwire hit 52 homers in 1996 for Oakland and 58 for the
Athletics and Cardinals last year.
 &UR; Cubs 7, Giants 3
	   In Chicago, Glenallen Hill, pinch-hitting for pitcher Kevin
Tapani, hit a grand slam home run as the Cubs beat the San
Francisco Giants.
	   It was Hill's third home run of the year and the fifth grand
slam of his career. The victory puts the Cubs, who came into the
game trailing the New York Mets by a game in the NL wild card race,
three games ahead of San Francisco in the race.
	   Sammy Sosa was quiet a day after hitting his 48th home run,
going 0-for-5 at the plate. He struck out three times.
 &UR; Cubs 7, Giants 3 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Glenallen Hill hit a pinch-hit grand slam as the
Cubs beat the San Francisco Giants.
	   It was Hill's third home run of the year and the fifth grand
slam of his career.
	   Kevin Tapani (15-7) gave up four hits and three runs _ including
two homers _ in five innings for the win. He also struck out five
and walked three. The Cubs shelled Russ Ortiz (1-3) for seven hits
and five runs in 4 2-3 innings.
	   Sammy Sosa was 0-for-5 with three strikeouts, one day after
hitting his 48th home run.
 &UR; Phillies 11, Diamondbacks 1, 1st game
	   In Philadelphia, Curt Schilling struck out 14 and tossed a
four-hitter and Scott Rolen and Bobby Abreu each hit three-run
homers to pace Philadelphia to a rout over Arizona in the first
game of a doubleheader.
	   Schilling (12-11), one strikeout shy of his season-high, walked
two en route to his 12th complete game of the season. He is 3-0
with a 0.72 ERA in 25 innings against Arizona. He raised his season
strikeout total to 247.
	   Rolen matched a career-high with five RBIs and hit his 25th
homer in the first when the Phillies took a 3-0 lead before Bob
Wolcott (1-3) could record an out.
 &UR; Rockies 6, Expos 3
	   In Montreal, Darryl Kile struck out a career-high 14 on the way
to his first road win since May as the Colorado Rockies beat the
Expos.
	   Kile (10-14) allowed three runs on nine hits in seven innings to
win his third straight start as Colorado snapped a four-game losing
streak. It was Kile's first road win since he beat the Expos on May
10.
	   Montreal has lost eight of its last 10.
	   Todd Helton's 19th home run in the sixth off Mike Thurman (2-2)
followed Vinny Castilla's two-out walk to put Colorado ahead 4-3.
The Rockies added two runs in the ninth on RBI singles by Darryl
Hamilton and Neifi Perez.
 &UR; Padres 2, Braves 0
	   In Atlanta, Kevin Brown combined with three other San Diego
pitchers on an 11-hit shutout and the Padres once again pulled
within a game of Atlanta for the best record in the National
League, beating the Braves.
	   Brown (16-4) joined teammate Andy Ashby and Atlanta's Greg
Maddux and Tom Glavine as the top winners in the NL. It was Brown's
first appearance at Turner Field since last October, when his
complete-game victory in Game 6 of the league championship series
sent Florida to the World Series.
	   Brown, who pitched a one-hitter against Milwaukee in his last
start, extended his scoreless streak to 16 innings.
 &UR; Dodgers 2, Marlins 1, 10 innings
	   In Miami, Jim Eisenreich walked with two outs and the bases
loaded against his former teammates to break a 10th-inning tie, and
the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Marlins.
	   Gary Sheffield homered in his first at-bat in Miami since being
traded by the Marlins to Los Angeles on May 15.
	   The Dodgers scored without a hit in the 10th against Justin
Speier (0-2). Eric Young led off with a walk, and when Speier threw
late to second on a sacrifice bunt, both runners were safe. After a
forceout left runners at first and third, Sheffield was
intentionally walked to load the bases, and pinch-hitter Eisenreich
walked on four pitches.
 &UR; Pirates 6, Reds 5
	   In Pittsburgh, Manny Martinez hit an RBI single in the ninth
over a drawn-in outfield to give the Pirates a victory over the
Cincinnati Reds.
	   Jason Kendall doubled to left on the first pitch thrown by Danny
Graves (2-1) in the ninth. One out later, Kendall stole third,
forcing the Reds to pull in their infield and outfield.
	   After Jose Guillen was hit by a pitch, Martinez lifted an 0-2
pitch over the head of center fielder Jeffrey Hammonds for his
third RBI of the game.

PGA champ Singh co-leader in International
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN MOSSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CASTLE ROCK, Colorado (AP) _ Newly crowned PGA champion Vijay
Singh maintained his hot hand, posting six birdies and an eagle to
share the early first-round lead Thursday in the weather-delayed
Sprint International.
	   Four days after capturing his first major, Singh scored 15
points under the modified Stableford system used in this unique
event, tying journeyman Jim Carter for the lead.
	   Tiger Woods, whose long game suits this course and format, was
just a point behind at 14, thanks to a pair of eagles. Corey Pavin,
having his best round in years, was at 13, along with Davis Love
III and David Sutherland.
	   Defending champion Phil Mickelson finished at 8, and David
Duval, the tour's leading money winner, stood at 7.
	   Lightning caused a suspension of play at mid-afternoon with half
the field still on the course.
	   Play resumed after a delay of 2 hours, 40 minutes, and when
darkness fell 36 players remained on the course. They were to
complete their rounds early Friday, with the second round beginning
as scheduled.
	   The leader among players still on the course was Brandt Jobe,
who had 12 points with three holes remaining.
	   The field will be cut to the low 70 players and ties for
Saturday's third round and to the low 36 and ties for Sunday's
final round.
	   Under a scoring format that awards 5 points for an eagle, 2
points for birdie, zero for par, minus-1 for bogey and minus-3 for
double bogey or worse, Singh had a steady round in which he didn't
miss a fairway.
	   He birdied three of his first six holes to get to plus-6,
dropped a point with a bogey at No. 7, then birdied three more
holes. He eagled the par-5 17th hole.
	   ``I hit a lot of good tee shots, a lot of good approach shots
and putted nicely,'' Singh said. ``Winning a major like that, I
just wanted to get back on the golf course and play again.
	   ``It's a good feeling to go out there and know that the
confidence from last week is so high that I could just let it go. I
don't worry about the bad shots, I just think about where I'm going
to hit the ball. The feeling is good, and you've got to ride it
while you can.''
	   Carter, 37, a non-winner in seven full seasons on the PGA Tour
whose best finish this year was a tie for third in the
Freeport-McDermott Classic, had nine birdies and also finished at
15.
	   Carter had 11 one-putt greens, including his last eight. He
birdied six of those eight holes and had sand saves on the other
two, moving him from plus-3 to plus-15.
	   ``Eleven one-putts, I could make that a habit,'' he said. ``I
could be addicted to that in no time. All in all, it was a pretty
nice day.''
	   He began his birdie barrage after hitting a ball into the water
at No. 10 and taking double bogey, dropping 3 points.
	   ``Maybe that was a blessing in disguise,'' he said. ``Sometimes
it takes a mistake to get you refocused.''
	   Woods, playing Castle Pines Golf Club for the first time,
started on No. 10 and got his first eagle at the par-4 13th. He
added 5 more points at the par-5 eighth hole.
	   Pavin, the 1995 U.S. Open champion who has been in a prolonged
slump since winning the Colonial in 1996, finished a distant 169th
on the money list last season and currently stands 189th. He has
missed the cut in nine of his 15 events this year.

Protesters storm U.S. Embassy compound after attack on factory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 17 grafs to clarify Lewinsky case. &QL; 
 &UR; By BASSEM MROUE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Angry Sudanese stormed the empty U.S.
Embassy compound in Khartoum early Friday and pulled down the
American flag to protest a U.S. missile attack on a pharmaceutical
plant in the Sudanese capital.
	   Sudanese government officials termed the missile attack ``a
criminal act'' and charged that it had been ordered by U.S.
President Bill Clinton to draw attention away from the
investigation into his relations with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky.
	   They said at least seven workers at the factory were injured in
the Thursday night attack and that some workers still were
unaccounted for and could be beneath the rubble.
	   Hours later, state-run Sudan Television showed scores of people
scaling the wrought-iron fence around the embassy in the heart of
the capital.
	   Hundreds more outside the fence threw stones at the building or
beat the fence with sticks.
	   They shouted ``Allahu Akbar,'' the Muslim rally cry meaning
``God is Great,'' and ``Down, Down USA'' in English.
	   The protesters pulled down the embassy flag and dragged it on
the ground.
	   It was unclear from the TV footage if they got inside the locked
building, and there was no footage to indicate if the mob remained
inside the compound or was dispersed by police.
	   The State Department ordered local staff to leave the embassy
after the Aug. 7 bombings of embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar
es-Salaam.
	   American diplomats were pulled out of Khartoum in 1996 after
Washington said it could no longer guarantee their security.
Diplomats stationed in Cairo and in Nairobi visit Khartoum
periodically to provide consular services.
	   Clinton ordered the attack on the factory in Khartoum in
retaliation for the bombings of the American embassies in East
Africa. U.S. missiles also struck suspected camps of Muslim
militant Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said in Washington that the
factory in Khartoum had been targeted as a suspected chemical
weapons site.
	   Sudan's president, Omar el-Bashir, called on Sudanese to protest
the attack Friday and said he would seek a U.N. investigation into
what the plant produced.
	   ``Sudanese people will defend themselves,'' el-Bashir told
state-run television in a broadcast monitored in Cairo.
	   Sudan's information minister, Ghazi Salah-Eddin, also denied the
weapons allegation, saying the factory produced ``cheap medicines
... for the diseases found in Sudan.''
	   He said the El-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co. was hit by
five missiles at 7:15 p.m. (1715 gmt) Thursday and that ``the
destruction is total.''
	   He called it ``a criminal act'' and accused the Clinton
administration of trying to draw public attention from the Monica
Lewinsky case. Clinton on Monday made a nationally televised
admission of having had sexual relations with Ms. Lewinksy
	   ``They want, 18th graf

Castle Pines greens slow but true
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WARD MARCHANT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CASTLE ROCK, Colorado (AP) _ Defending champion Phil Mickelson
echoed what other players have been saying: Castle Pines' greens
are a little slower than in the past, but it hasn't seemed to
affect the scoring.
	   ``It played very similar to the way it played in the past,''
Mickelson said after racking up 8 points Thursday in the first
round of the International.
	   ``The greens might be a little slower than in years past _ you
probably won't see as many three putts, but you might not see as
many `makes' as well.
	   ``I don't think the scores are that much different than in
year's past.''
	   Mickelson, also the 1993 winner, was 7 points behind co-leaders
Vijay Singh and Jim Carter.
	   Chris Perry, who also had 8 points, called the greens ``a little
scragglier than they have normally been ... ''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; BLACK IS GOOD, RED IS BAD: &LR;  Tiger Woods said he didn't add up
Stableford points until late in his round and preferred to think of
himself as 1- or 2-under par. But recognizing black, or positive,
numbers as good and red, or negative, numbers as bad _ the reverse
of standard tournaments _ apparently will take some getting used
to.
	   ``When I was walking up the last hole,'' he said, ``I looked
over at our standard-bearer and I kind of got freaked out. It said
black 14. I thought, `I'm not playing that bad.'''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; WHO CAN'T?: &LR;  Corey Pavin is widely known as one of the shorter
hitters on tour.
	   So the question at Thursday's interview, after Pavin had posted
a plus 13 to rank among the leaders, seemed a natural.
	   The reporter wanted to know if Castle Pines' 17th hole, a
relatively short par-5 at 492 yards (447 meters), was ``the only
par-5 you can reach.''
	   ``No,'' retorted Pavin, ``I can reach them all. Sometimes in
three, four, five, but I can reach them.''
	   The reporter explained he meant to ask if it was the only par-5
he could reach in two strokes.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; STABLEFORD ADVANTAGE: &LR;  The advantage long hitters have in The
International's modified Stableford format was illustrated Thursday
when Corey Pavin turned in a nifty 66. Tiger Woods, on the other
hand, had a 68.
	   But Woods, one of the longest hitters on tour, wound up with 14
Stableford points, while Pavin, one of the shortest, had 13.
	   The difference? Tiger's two eagles and four birdies, along with
four bogeys, more than offset Pavin's seven birdies and a single
bogey.
	   The Stableford system of scoring gives 5 points for each eagle
and 2 points for each birdie. A bogey drops only 1 point and a par
yields no points.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; CELL PHONE CRACKDOWN: &LR;  After Tiger Woods had to back off a putt
on his 10th hole because of a ringing cellular phone and also was
distracted by spectator cameras, he made his feelings known.
	   And that had almost instant repercussions.
	   ``Today people were taking pictures on our swings and stuff, and
it's just ridiculous,'' Woods said. ``They are not allowed on the
golf course and they should be taken away.''
	   Once alerted, tournament executive director Larry Thiel said it
would no longer be tolerated. He said a number of cameras, cell
phones and pagers were removed from people in the gallery and that
a ``tougher policy'' would be invoked for the final three days of
the tournament.
	   Thiel pointed out that Sprint, the sponsor of the tournament,
has a number of kiosks in the parking lot and on the course which
offer free digital phones _ but they don't ring.
	   ``We encourage fans to take advantage of this free service
offered by our title sponsor and leave their phones in the car or
at home,'' he said.

Officials will have to register assets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ High-ranking Vietnamese officials will
have to register their personal assets as early as next month under
a new government ordinance aimed at fighting rampant corruption,
the official Vietnam News reported Friday.
	   Prime Minister Phan Van Khai signed the ordinance Monday, giving
legal basis to an anti-corruption decree passed by the National
Assembly Standing Committee in February.
	   It follows more than two years of heated debate by the party
hierarchy and National Assembly.
	   Effective Sept. 1, high-ranking officials will have to register
houses, land and any other assets with an estimated face value of
more than 50 million dong (dlrs 3,600).
	   The decree applies to management posts in state-owned
enterprises and administrative offices in all sectors, including
the army and police, along with top local officials and ranking
officials of party organizations, professional and social
associations.
	   It bars family members from holding certain jobs at the offices
or enterprises of high-placed officials. They must transfer to
other jobs before the decree takes effect.
	   Top officials are banned from setting up or holding key
positions in private or joint stock companies unless appointed by
the relevant agencies, and are not allowed to deposit money,
precious stones or valuable metals in foreign banks outside
Vietnam.
	   The decree also stipulates punishment for officials found guilty
of corruption.
	   It says the obligatory registration of personal assets is not
aimed at tracking the original sources of the items, but rather a
far-reaching measure to prevent corruption.
	   Corruption has been on rise in Vietnam since the country opened
up to the world a decade ago and has been the source of social
unrest that has rocked many rural areas over the past few years.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Religious leaders in Pakistan said
they would offer special prayers and lead demonstrations against
U.S. attacks in the fellow Islamic nations of Afghanistan and
Sudan.
	   ``We won't allow this incident go by unnoticed. It is time for
the Muslims of the world to unite,'' said Munaar Hasan, general
secretary of the right-wing Jamiat-e-Islami, a political and
religious group that has vowed to transform Pakistan into a strict
Islamic state.
	   Hasan said Thursday the call would go out from mosques on
Friday, the Muslim holy day, for the faithful to stage
demonstrations in the major cities of Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi
following prayers.
	   A spokesman for Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, the key ally in Pakistan
of Afghanistan's hard-line Taliban rulers, said he was shocked by
the U.S. attack and expected angry reactions across Pakistan
Friday.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said Thursday he ordered strikes on
targets linked to Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan
and Sudan after determining the sites were linked to those
responsible for the bombings of U.S. embassies in eastern Africa.
The Aug. 7 bombings in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania,
killed 257 people and injured more than 5,500. The United States
has called bin Laden a major sponsor of terrorism around the world.
	   ``America itself has emerged as a big terrorist state by
attacking two independent and free countries,'' Hasan said, adding
Pakistan's government ``will be held accountable'' if it had
facilitated the U.S. action.
	   Pakistani officials have said repeatedly in recent days that the
United States had not approached them about attacking bin Laden,
and defense officials said Thursday they were taken by surprise
when cruise missiles flew across Pakistani airspace to hit the
Afghan sites.
	   Though the Pakistani government is a U.S. ally, a vocal minority
in the officially Islamic country often portrays the United States
as an enemy of Islam.
	   Large anti-American demonstrations took place in Pakistan during
the Gulf War in 1991, when the United States attacked the Islamic
state of Iraq. Last year, four U.S. employees of Houston-based
energy company Union Texas were shot dead in Karachi. The slayings
came after a Pakistani who had been arrested in Pakistan by U.S.
FBI agents was convicted in the shooting deaths of CIA agents.
	   The United States evacuated most of its diplomatic staff in
Pakistan earlier this week and strongly urged other Americans to
leave as well. It also advised foreign aid workers in Afghanistan
to leave.

Indonesia reverses decision to sell off cement company
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Faced with public pressure,
Indonesia's cash-strapped government said Friday it will maintain
control over the country's largest cement maker PT Semen Gresik,
reversing its earlier decision to sell it to foreign investors.
	   Sofyan Djalil, deputy state-owned enterprises minister, said the
government will only sell 14 percent of Semen Gresik and will
retain the 51 percent majority stake.
	   ``Because the pressure from the society ... we think it's better
for the government to keep the controlling stake,'' Sofyan said.
	   The proposed sell-off of the cement company had been part of a
wider privatization plan aimed at helping fix Indonesia's ailing
economy, which is in the midst of its worst economic crisis in 30
years.
	   However, the government backed off from the plan to sell a
controlling stake to foreigners after demonstrations in the western
part of the island of Sumatra.
	   West Sumatrans don't want foreigners to control PT Semen Padang,
a wholly owned subsidiary of Semen Gresik, fearing that there may
be massive job losses.
	   Mexico's Cemex SA won the first round of bidding for 35 percent
of Semen Gresik last month by offering dlrs 287 million, or dlrs
1.38 per share.
	   Under the terms of the government's agreement with the Mexican
cement maker, other companies had until last Wednesday to top
Cemex's bid. Cemex would have then been given the opportunity to
choose from those bids.
	   ``We are discussing with Cemex. We have had contractual
agreement with Cemex already. So far they are very cooperative,''
Sofyan said.
	   He said the government will come up with a new share holding
formula with prospective investors.

Rare herb, touted as `Lebanese Viagra,' suddenly the rage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The plant known as Shirsh Zallouh has
grown high in Lebanon's mountains for millennia, disturbed only by
herbalists who prescribe it as a stimulant.
	   But almost overnight, the root has entered the common
vernacular. The spark? Beirut newspapers have christened Shirsh
Zallouh the ``Lebanese Viagra.''
	   The sudden surge in demand by Lebanese men and women seeking a
sex panacea is causing scientists to fret about the plant's
possible extinction. Health officials, meanwhile, worry that
amateur harvesters could confuse the plant with look-alike roots
that are highly toxic.
	   Pierre Malychef, an ecologist and former professor of
pharmacology at two Lebanese universities, found six harmful plants
that were mistaken for the herb. One of them contained the poison
that killed the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates.
	   Shirsh Zallouh, Arabic for ``hairy root,'' grows above 6,000
feet (1,800 meters). It can be picked from August to October, after
its roots mature and before snow makes the mountains inaccessible.
It belongs to the parsley family and has the Latin name Ferula
Hormonis.
	   While some specialists doubt the plant's medicinal value, people
are climbing eastern Lebanon's mountains and biblical Mount Hermon
in the south to gather the roots for personal use or for sale.
	   ``I am afraid an ecological disaster will ensue if the
uncontrolled harvesting continues,'' said Malychef.
	   Businessman Kuftan Jamal said he cannot get enough to meet
increasing demand. The price has risen from dlrs 3.30 to dlrs 16.50
for a little more than 2 pounds.
	   Some herb dealers say they've had inquiries from as far away as
Australia and Japan about deals to package the drug as a modern
medicine.
	   The Shirsh Zallouh fad began weeks ago when newspapers dubbed it
``Lebanese Viagra without the side effects.'' Most Arab states have
banned the U.S. impotency drug.
	   Usually the roots of Shirsh Zallouh are eaten after being soaked
in wine or are ground into powder that is put into capsules or
mixed with tea. In Syria, the powder is mixed with honey.
	   Dr. Wassim Wazzan, a specialist in treating impotence at
Beirut's American University Hospital, expressed skepticism about
its effectiveness, saying, ``We as doctors trained in Western
medicine ... don't use herbs.''
	   But Dr. Ali Abou Hamman, a physician in the village of Chebaa
near Mount Hermon, said in a telephone interview that he has
treated ``hundreds of people ... with a 100 percent success rate.''

Police strike ends in Mexican state of Chiapas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ More than 4,000
Chiapas state policemen ended a one-day strike Thursday after an
official agreed to take their concerns to the governor.
	   The police officers went on strike Wednesday to protest a cut in
medical benefits and to demand a 50 percent wage increase and
better weaponry.
	   The deputy attorney general for public security, Sabino Aguilar,
agreed to meet Thursday with Gov. Roberto Albores Guillen to
discuss the concerns. Although he said he didn't agree with the
police strike, Aguilar said ``their demands are just and valid.''
	   The police also demanded an increase in travel pay and freedom
for state policemen jailed on charges stemming from the Dec. 22
massacre in the village of Acteal, in which 45 people were killed.
	   Aguilar said it will be up to the courts to determine whether to
free the policemen.
	   Villagers in Acteal sympathize with the Zapatista rebels who
rose up in arms in January 1994, demanding greater democracy and
Indian rights.
