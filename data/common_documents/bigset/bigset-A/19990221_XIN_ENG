<HEADLINE> NATO Waits for Rambouillet Peace Talks to End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) representatives were still waiting for the
Rambouillet peace talks to produce results even though the midday
Saturday deadline had already passed by more than four hours, said
a NATO official.
</P>
<P>
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the
press that the Western military alliance was not in a position to
make a decision unless there was a clear alternative on the
outcome of the peace talks in the French castle outside Paris.
</P>
<P>
He added that NATO had been building a military presence around
the Yugoslav province of Kosovo and B-52 heavy bombers were
expected to arrive in Britain from the United States on Saturday
to put more pressure on the Yugoslav authorities. NATO blames
Yugoslavia for refusing to accept the multinational peace
implementation force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The NATO official said the Rambouillet peace deal would not be
a peace deal unless it combined the political and military aspects.
The military aspect is the deployment in Kosovo of NATO-led peace
implementation force to guarantee the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is possible to postpone the deadline for the
Rambouillet talks until a later time with the political aspect
signed first.
</P>
<P>
But the Western military alliance is prepared to take the
necessary means including, air strikes, should the situation arise,
the official said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Diplomats Leave Yugoslavia Before Kosovo Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. embassy in Belgrade
has been evacuating its staff because of possible NATO air-strikes
against Yugoslavia, the Evening News here reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At dawn Saturday, a group of about 75 U.S. embassy staff and
their families rolled out of Belgrade in a convoy of about 20 cars
and jeeps full of luggage and headed for Budapest, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Charge d'Affaires Richard Miles told the press that the U.
S. government decided to withdraw a majority of its diplomats and
citizens working in Yugoslavia because of the increased danger in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Miles said he and a few U.S. embassy staff would remain in
their posts in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Staff in the U.S. consulate general and representatives of U.S.
firms in Podgorica, capital of the Republic of Montenegro, also
reportedly began to leave Yugoslavia Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks in Rambouillet, France, between Serb and Kosovo
ethnic Albanian representatives have lasted nearly two weeks and
are entering the final stage.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and NATO had repeatedly claimed that no matter what
the outcome of the Rambouillet talks would be, NATO would send its
ground troops to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
They warned that Belgrade would face NATO air-strikes if it
denied NATO troops entry into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
However, President of Serbian Republic of Yugoslavia Milan
Milutinovic told reporters in Paris on Saturday evening that
Yugoslavia strongly opposes the proposed dispatch of NATO forces
to Kosovo. He said that the dispatch would mean NATO occupation of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic also noted that more time is needed to reach
consensus on the military provisions of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Serb and ethnic Albanian representatives had been previously
given a noon Saturday deadline to reach an agreement, but the
deadline had been extended until Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Russian FM Rules Out Peace Treaty With Japan by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov on Sunday ruled out the possibility of
concluding a peace treaty with Japan by 2000, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
"It is not possible," Ivanov was quoted as saying during a
meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese Foreign Ministry official said that the two
ministers "energetically discussed" two conflicting proposals on
how to resolve a long-standing territorial dispute and sign a
peace treaty by 2000.
</P>
<P>
One of the proposals was made last April by the then Japanese
prime minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and a counterproposal was made
last November by Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin reportedly proposed that the two countries use the
peace treaty to reaffirm their commitment to resolving the
territorial dispute while leaving its actual resolution to a
separate pact.
</P>
<P>
The Hashimoto proposal reportedly involves giving Moscow
temporary administrative rights over the islands after the two
countries draw a demarcation line between Etorofu, the most
northerly of the islands, and Russia's Uruppu Island --
effectively recognizing Japanese sovereignty over them.
</P>
<P>
Japan has strongly wished to conclude a peace treaty with
Russia after resolving the territorial dispute by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister, however, reportedly, said in
Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk in Russia's Far East before flying to Tokyo
Saturday that Russia will not accept any options which would mean
giving up sovereignty over four Russian-held islands off Japan's
northernmost main island of Hokkaido.
</P>
<P>
The four islands, which were seized by Soviet troops at the end
of World War II, are Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai
group of islets.
</P>
<P>
The Russian minister, who arrived Saturday night for a four-day
visit, is scheduled to meet separately Monday with Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi and Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party.

Understanding and the Lahore Declaration, between the two
countries reflected the areas of understanding that they have
established during the course of his visit, and the forward
looking agenda Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and he have been
working on.
</P>
<P>
He said they must implement their various understanding in good
faith.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee extended an invitation to the Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif to visit India at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about exercise of self-determination by
the Kashmiri people, Vajpayee said discussions on Kashmir issues
are going on and it is difficult to say what solution will emerge.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the relevant U.N. resolutions on Kashmir, Pakistani
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said he adequately dealt with the
Kashmir issue during his speech at the banquet he hosted in honor
of Vajpayee Saturday evening and people will eventually know what
transpired between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Lahore Declaration signed by the two prime
ministers Sunday, Sharif said "it clearly says that the two sides
will intensify their efforts to resolve all issues including Jammu
and Kashmir."
</P>
<P>
"The ice has broken," said Sharif, hoping that both Pakistani
and Indian governments "will be able to make further progress on
all issues including Jammu and Kashmir."
</P>
<P>
To another question relating to bilateral economic cooperation,
he said the two countries have agreed to consult each other on WTO
(World Trade Organization) requirements. Pakistan's Commerce
Minister Ishaq Dar will have further discussions with the Indian
side, he said.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
(CTBT), Vajpayee said he had discussed the CTBT issue with his
Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif but no decision has been taken.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Claims to Have Shot Down U.S. Warplane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 21 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi military spokesman
announced on Sunday that Iraqi air defense units shot down one of
U.S. warplanes that violated southern Iraqi airspace.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency quoted the spokesman as saying that 15
formations of U.S. warplanes, supported by early warning AWACS
and E2C aircraft, violated southern Iraqi airspace on Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
These U.S. warplanes coming from Saudi and Kuwaiti bases
carried out 42 hostile air sorties over Basra, Misan, Muthana
and Dhi-Qar provinces, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iraqi air defense units encountered these enemy
planes, and evidence reported said that one of them had been
fired, others had been forced to flee from Iraqi airspace.
</P>
<P>
Iraq in the past have said for several times that its air
defense units have downed enemy planes. The claims have been
denied by the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched air strikes against Iraq in
mid-December to retaliate what they claimed Iraqi non-cooperation
with U.N. arms inspectors in charge of eliminating Iraq's banned
weapons.
</P>
<P>
After those attacks, Iraq announced that it would fire at
U.S.-British warplanes patrolling the no-fly zones imposed by
the U.S.-led western allies following the 1991 Gulf War with a
claimed aim of protecting the Kurds in the north and the
Shiite Muslims in the south from Baghdad's suppression.
</P>
<P>
Since then, clashes between the Iraqi air defense forces
and U.S.-British jets patrolling these restricted zones have
almost become daily occurrence.

MOGADISHU, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Weapons and ammunition are
flowing into Somalia despite the U.N. arms embargo imposed against
the country since 1991 and consignments of arms are arriving for
many factions from abroad.
</P>
<P>
According to a businessman who refused to be named, 13 trucks
carrying ammunition and small arms have already been off loaded at
a port of Merca town, 100 kms south of Mogadishu, and are on their
way to the capital Sunday, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The ship which has no name on it is said to be an army vessel
belonging to Russia chartered by Eritrea in an agreement on
bringing the weapons for Hussein Mohamed Aidid who recently paid
an unexpected visit to Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The report said as the fighting between Ethiopia and Eritrea
along the border is escalating, each side is trying to arm
somalia's rival faction in an attempt to relieve its pressure on
its border with or near Somalia. Ethiopia is said to have been
involved into Somalia's politics by supplying arms to factions
opposing late General Aidid. And Eritrea has just started
supplying Hussein Aidid's faction with ammunition.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAHORE, PAKISTAN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif said Sunday that his talks with his Indian
counterpart Atal Bihari Vajpayee are "substantive and
constructive".
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint press conference at the Governor House
Sunday afternoon, Sharif said that the two sides discussed the all
outstanding issues including the issue of Jammu and Kashmir and
the peace and security related issues.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said that during the formal talks Sunday which lasted
for 90 minutes, the Pakistani government reiterated its principle
positions on nuclear and conventional issues and as well as its
earnest desire to avoid an arms race in South Asia region.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is interested in promoting confidence, confidence
building measures in the nuclear and conventional fields with the
view to reduce the danger of conflict and achieve nuclear
restraint and stabilization, he said.
</P>
<P>
Neither Pakistan nor India have gained anything from the
conflicts and tensions of the past 50 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
The people of this region risk losing out in the march to the
development if it remains caught in the vicious circle of mistrust
and suspicion, Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that confrontation is giving way to cooperation. Many
complicated disputes have been resolved. Nations are increasingly
engaged in mutually beneficial interactions.
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason why these positive global trends should
bypass South Asia," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sharif expressed his hope that the Pak-Indian relationship
should be free of tensions and is based on mutual trust and
confidence.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani prime minister said he is convinced that
objectives of peace, progress and prosperity can be achieved in
South Asia provided there is the will and commitment.
</P>
<P>
"Let us dedicate our energies to further promote and strengthen
the regional cooperation under SAARC (South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation) for the peoples of South Asia for peace,
security and development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sharif stressed that "we must bring peace to South Asia. We
must bring prosperity to our peoples. We owe these to ourselves
and our future generations."
</P>
<P>
He said that Pakistan and India Sunday signed two important
documents. "They reflected an earnest desire on our part to turn a
new leaf in the chapter of the Pak-India relationship," he added.

<HEADLINE> Orphans Spend Spring Festival With Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- A number of urban families in
Harbin, capital of northeastern China's Heilongjiang Province,
hosted visits by orphans during this year's Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
Many children lost their families during last summer's record
flooding. An ensuing local government investigation revealed that
a large number of orphans in flood-stricken districts and counties
were living a poor quality of life. Most of the orphans depend on
the support of relatives and local government donations, with many
forced to quit school for financial reasons.
</P>
<P>
The local government responded by allocating 120,000 yuan (14,
460 US dollars), as well as clothing, food and quilts valued at
200,000 yuan to assist the children. It also selected 100 orphans
subject to dire conditions to spend Spring Festival with urban
families.
</P>
<P>
The 100 orphans, the oldest 14 and the youngest seven. came
from 50 underdeveloped remote villages. The group was selected
from some 1,300 orphaned children.
</P>
<P>
"I'm an orphan. The motherland raised me and I treated 11-year-
old Chen Nan as one of my granddaughters," said a tearful Chi
Fengzhi. Chen spent the festival with Chi's family over the
Chinese Lunar New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
"I have a new family, and I'll work hard to gain acceptance to
the Harbin Polytechnical University which I just visited," said
Chen. The young orphan had lived with her 78-year-old grandpa
since disease took the life of her parents.
</P>
<P>
The group of orphans not only toured the city and various
universities, but will also receive assistance enabling them to
complete senior high school.
</P>
<P>
"We lost our parents, but staying with warm families and
receiving help from so many kind people has eased the loneliness."
said the orphans.

<P>
NAIROBI, February 21 (Xinhua) -- President Laurent Kabila of
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has dissolved the Congolese
cabinet, a report reaching here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Congo state radio quoted a presidential decree dated
Saturday as saying that the Government of the Public Salvation
named on June 1, 1998, has been dissolved and ordered to expedite
current business.
</P>
<P>
The decree said that the dissolution took account of the
demands imposed by the six-month-old conflict being waged in the
third largest African country and the need to reinforce national
unity, democratization and national reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
DRC Information Minister Didier Mumengi was quoted as saying
that a new government would be named "shortly" and that the
outgoing government would run the country until then.
</P>
<P>
Kabila signed the decree after returning to Kinshasa Friday
from a trip to Saudi Arabia. He left for the southern town of
Lubumbashi Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kabila ousted late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and took power in
May, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The vast central African country fell into civil war in early
August last year when the Tutsi-led rebels took up arms against
Kabila.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Urges Non-Interference in Turkey's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit Sunday called for no foreign interference in the justice of
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit made the call at a press conference before Kurdish rebel
leader Abdullah Ocalan is to be tried on Imrali Island in Marmara
Sea near Turkey's western Bursa.
</P>
<P>
He said that "we also expect the politicians and governments
of foreign countries, or the representatives of any international
body, to refrain from attempts to put pressure on our courts."
</P>
<P>
"We would consider such attempts as an unacceptable affront to
Turkish justice," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He added that "justice is completely independent in Turkey.
Neither the government nor the parliament can intervene in its
functioning."
</P>
<P>
Ecevit declined to answer what countries to help capture
Ocalan in Kenya, but said that the U.S. has provided full support
for Turkey's struggle against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, leader of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), was
arrested by Turkish commandos in Kenya on Tuesday and brought back
to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 a guerrilla war for an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the U.S. were believed to help in Ocalan's
capture. Israel denied any role in the event, but the U.S. only
denied involvement in Ocalan's actual capture.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit also called on those circles in Western Europe, who have
been supporting and provoking PKK, to stop this unseemly behavior.
</P>
<P>
Those circles and governments who, for years, had provoked or
condoned the PKK atrocities, or had been encouraging separatist
tendencies against Turkey, must have realized during the recent
days that they had been playing with fire, Ecevit said.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit expressed his hope that no European governments will
attempt to bargain at Turkey's expense with those outlawed PKK
terrorists who have savagely occupied and rampaged public
buildings and consulates in some European countries.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan's arrest had triggered Kurdish demonstrations and
protests around Europe and the Middle East, some of which turned
violent and bloody.
</P>
<P>
Greece, Kenya, israel have closed many of their foreign
agencies in the wake of the Kurdish unrest.

BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The world finally drew a
breath of relief some eight hours after the deadline passed and
news from Rambouillet indicated that the Kosovo peace talks had
been extended for an additional three days.
</P>
<P>
Most Chinese are currently enjoying the Spring Festival, the
major festival of the year. Nonetheless, Chinese citizens are
greatly concerned about the outcome of the negotiations in the
distant 14th-century chateau.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said today that "China
strongly opposes any military action against Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
She noted that China has consistently advocated a peaceful
solution to the issue on the basis of respecting Yugoslovia's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as ensuring the
lawful interests of all ethnic groups in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Zhang urged the international community and relevant parties in
Yugoslavia to "continue dialog in order to find a political
settlement to the issue."
</P>
<P>
Chinese citizens have closely monitored media reports that
substantial progress has been made on the political part of a
three-year interim agreement and future talks will focus on the
military aspects of the issue. The Serbian Government in
Yugoslavia strongly opposes any NATO military presence in Kosovo,
with ethnic Albanians saying "no" to disarmament of the Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA).
</P>
<P>
The six-nation Contact Group, including representatives from
Britain, France, Germany, Russia, the United States and Italy,
issued a statement earlier today stressing that any party sparking
a breakdown in the negotiations will be "held accountable".
</P>
<P>
NATO reiterated that it will launch military strikes against
Yugoslavia if the negotiations fail. Some 430-odd NATO warplanes
remain for standby for a possible bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
Local international relations experts note the continuing "
uncertainty" surrounding the prospects for the talks which they
point to as the Sword of Damocles hanging over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that external intervention, military action in
particular, has never been an effective method for resolving
disputes. Resorting to or even threatening to use force will
simply complicate the Kosovo problem, and will seriously threaten
regional security and stability.
</P>
<P>
The weather in Rambouillet remains chilly and people throughout
the world will spend an anxious three days awaiting the outcome of
the talks. Peace advocates anticipate an acceptable end to the
crisis and note that cold winter days will soon give way to the
arrival of spring.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Air Force Bombs Eritrea's Assab Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government
said Sunday afternoon that its air force bombed Eritrea's Assab
airport runway at 6:15 a.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A short statement issued by the the Office of Ethiopian
Government Spokesperson Selome Taddesse said the Assab airport "is
a strategy military target" and that the Ethiopian air force "has
inflicted heavy damage" on the airport runway.
</P>
<P>
It admitted that the Ethiopian air force bombed Harsele, "a
logistical support center" for the Eritrean army, 20 kilometers
west of Assab on February 16.
</P>
<P>
Hostilities between Ethiopia and Eritrea resumed on February 6
after several months' lull over a border dispute. Ethiopia accused
Eritrea of bombing Adi Grat first, but Asmara said it was an
excuse fabricated by Addis Ababa for launching the offensive.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is angry that Eritrea refused to implement a peace
pact offered by the Organization of African Unity and this time
uses planes to attack Eritrean targets breaking the moratorium on
air strikes and justifying its offensive against Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassadorial Committee of the High-Level Delegation of the
OAU delivered a message of the High-Level Delegation to the
governments of both Ethiopian and Eritrean Friday and Saturday
respectively, calling on the two sides to "put an immediate end to
the fighting and to re-commit themselves to a peaceful resolution
to the dispute based on the OAU proposals for a framework
agreement".
</P>
<P>
The dispute for the "contested territory" between the two Horn
of Africa neighbors has lasted for over nine months since it broke
out in early May, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Huaihe River Pollution Control Efforts Yield Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- A constantly rising income has
enabled Wei Zengliang, a fisherman on Hongze Lake in east China's
Jiangsu Province, to enjoy the happiest Spring Festival season in
many years.
</P>
<P>
Some 1.3 million people living in the lake area, China's fourth
largest freshwater lake, have witnessed a resurgence in the local
fishing industry resulting from the success of the ongoing
pollution control program in the upper reaches of the Huaihe River.
</P>
<P>
The program, which was initiated in 1996, has led to the
closure of some 65,000 factories considered to be serious
polluters. Related closure has greatly improved sewage treatment
efforts along the river. A recent report issued by the provincial
environmental protection department indicates that sewage
discharges into Hongze lake have dropped by more than 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
The improved water quality has in turn yielded increased
profits for local fishermen, with coverage of fish farms growing
by 1,200 ha last year to reach 9,333 hectares in Hongze County.
The local fisheries industry produced 410,000 tons of aquatic
products during the year, a big increase over the previous year.
The surplus provided some 300,000 local fishermen with additional
income of over 15 million yuan. Wei, for example, earned some 10,
000 yuan from selling freshwater shrimp.
</P>
<P>
In last year, the county's autumn crab harvest attracted 27
major Hong Kong aquatic products companies, with exports to
Southeast Asia reached a 15-year record of 200,000 kilograms.

KUALA LUMPUR, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Power sharing by

BN comprises of 14 political parties representing various

Such sharing of power was exhorted by Islam in efforts to
ensure peace and unity among various races in a country like
Malaysia, he said at a tea party here.
</P>

"Under the BN concept, Muslims vote for non-Muslims and
non-Muslims cast their ballots for Muslim leaders. This is power
sharing...a system of administration exhorted by Islam to bring
about peace, well-being and unity," he was quoted by the Malaysian
national news agency Bernama as saying.

</P>
<P>
Addressing a civic reception in his honor at Governor House

a result of his talks with his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif,
they have arrived at some good decisions which would equally be

horrible past now as Pakistan and India are two neighbors and they

defensive purposes and committed not to use nuclear weapons

<P>
LAGOS, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The presidential candidate of
the People's Democratic Party (PDP), General Olusegun Obasanjo, is
scheduled to embark on a one-week campaign all over the country
from Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During the campaign tour, six former presidential aspirants will
join the party's flag bearer to present a picture of harmony in
the party.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, General Obasanjo will host a dinner in capital Abuja
to raise 500 million Naira (about 5.8 million U.S. Dollars) to
boost his campaign program.
</P>
<P>

voted during the Saturday National Assembly election, The Post
Express reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>

to win influence at his constituency during the governorship and
state assembly polls, Saturday's victory at his polling booth
could be an indication of a change of heart by his kinsmen toward
his aspiration to the presidency.

<P>
After casting his vote in the Asasin compound polling booth,
Obasanjo told reporters that he would enunciate policies which
will encourage investment flow into Nigeria and tackle social
problems affecting education, health and etc.

presidential ticket during the party's special national convention
held last week in Jos, Plateau State, according to the paper.

<HEADLINE> Women Journalists' Expedition to Yangtze River Source (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aged between 23 and 71, most of the 13 explorers are women
journalists from national and local Chinese media. All but one
never had such an adventure in the desolated Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
over 5,000 meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to find out what it is like in the source area
of the Yangtze and whether the successive floods in the middle and
lower reaches of the river have anything to do with ecological
changes there," says Wang Yongchen, a senior reporter with the
Beijing-based China National Radio.
</P>
<P>
The expedition started from Chengdu on August 19, 1998 when the
middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River were ridden by one
of the worst floods within the century, and arrived at Yanshiping,
a town in the immediate vicinity of the source area of the Yangtze,
on August 29.
</P>
<P>
From there, they were to trek through 800 sq. km desolated land,
supported by six experienced male explorers providing logistics
and seven local Tibetan guides plus 20 yaks, before they reached
the Jianggudiru Glacier, the farthest source of the Yangtze's
three fountainhead rivers. At this spot they began to raft
downstream off and on in the net-shaped water courses there.
</P>
<P>
The source area of the Yangtze covers 100,000 sq. km, a size
almost equal to the entire area of Iceland, with an average
altitude of 5,500 meters above sea level.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Daily Trading Activity
and Open Positions Summary Report of the Hong Kong Futures
Exchange (HKFE) will be available for public reference on its web
site starting from February 22, the HKFE announced here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued by the HKFE on Sunday, the HKFE said
that the move represents another milestone in its efforts to make
available market data to market practitioners, the media and
members of the public.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary version of the report will be uploaded to the web
site at around 9:30 p.m. the same day, and it will be replaced by
a final report at around 3:00 a.m. the following day, the HKFE
said.
</P>
<P>
These reports provide data on all the futures and options
products currently traded at HKFE on either the open outcry system
or the Automated Trading System.
</P>
<P>
A report on the market share data on Hang Seng Index futures
has been earlier introduced on HKFE's web site.
</P>
<P>
It gives the aggregate performance of the top 10 HKFE members
as a percentage in terms of both open interests and number of
contracts traded -- both in the past week and in the past month.
</P>
<P>
It also gives the total past-week and past-month turnover of
this product as a percentage relative to the stock market. As an
important indicator of the level of market activities, open
interest is an important factor in mapping out trading strategies.

<HEADLINE> Women Journalists' Expedition to Yangtze River Source (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The journey proved to be an Odyssey. "At first," Wang says, "we
enjoyed the leisure of walking on the carpet-like grassy marshland
of the Plateau. Pretty soon we found the land so tricky that you
may easily get caught in water hidden in the grass and leave your
shoes wet all day."
</P>
<P>
Ten days after they left Yanshiping, the expedition reached the
Jianggudiru Glacier, when everyone was excited at the sight of
unique landscape.
</P>
<P>
"There I saw drops of the water melt from the glaciers, and it
is incredible that it is these drops that form the torrents of the
Yangtze," says Wang.
</P>
<P>
But their excitement soon vanished. Chen Xiaoqiong, the only
experienced explorer on the expedition who came to the area once
in 1994, noted that the glaciers had retreated by more than 100
meters over the past four years.
</P>
<P>
"This time we actually camped on the very site of a glacial
lake I saw four years ago," says Chen. "Now the lake disappeared,
with only gravels left."
</P>
<P>
According to Prof. Tang Xingbang from the Chengdu Branch of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences, who worked as a science adviser with
the expedition, glaciers at Jianggudiru had retreated by at least
300 meters over the 12 years since 1986. He described the bygone
Jianggudiru as "a natural museum of glaciers with magnificent
landscapes of icy tower forests, icy conical peaks and icy planks
in the shape of teeth.'
</P>
<P>
Regretting what he saw a decade later, Tang warns that "if
glaciers continue to retreat at such a speed, the whole of the
Jianggudiru Glacier is doomed to perish before long."

<P>
The journey was arduous. But to Wang Yongchen and Tang
Xiangbang, what was more tormenting was the evidence of ecological
deterioration in the source area of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Marshlands have turned dry, and grasslands are encroached upon
by Gobi deserts. The situation was particularly serious in the
eastern and northern slopes of Geladaindong Mountain areas.
</P>
<P>
Human activities, especially the excessive herding and grazing,
have been considered one of the main causes for the retreating of
glaciers, desertification of grasslands and many other signs of
worsening ecology apart from climatic changes, says Prof. Tang.
</P>
<P>
A scientific experiment conducted in the 1967 found that if a
piece of frozen-earth grass cover was taken away from a hill on
the Plateau, 15 or 20 years later the entire hill would become
barren, with no vegetation left.
</P>
<P>
"The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, known as the third pole of the
globe, is a perfect laboratory for us to explore the cause for the
changing climate and environment of the earth," says Prof. Cheng
Guodong, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. "It is
no less important than Antarctica and Arctic in this sense."
</P>
<P>
But not a thorough and overall scientific expedition has ever
been conducted in the source area of the Yangtze. "It is really a
pity," says Prof. Tang. And Cheng shares his feeling. "We know too
little about the source area of the Yangtze River. How can we
protect the river and its fountainhead ecology if we don't even
know about its problems?"
</P>
<P>
Their worries are echoed by Wang Yongchen, who encouraged other
journalists during the expedition to campaign for public awareness
of the environmental protection of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
"I remember seeing herds of wild yaks, Tibetan antelope, wild
Tibetan ducks, white-lipped deer and other wildlife species during
a trip to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in 1993," she says. "But this
time I deplored that the number of wildlife of the Plateau has
dropped quickly because of snow calamity and poaching there, and
quite a number of wildlife species have moved out of their
original inhabitable areas because of the deteriorating
environment."
</P>
<P>
On the whole, Wang regards the expedition as "a worthy
experience." Not only did they get some first-hand stuffs of the
ecological situation in the source area of the Yangtze River, but
also demonstrate women's guts and tenacity in a very challenging
environment.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless Wang says she has some regrets. "For one thing,"
she says, "if I could have contacted more scientists in the field
before the expedition, I could have brought back samples of water,
ice, frozen earth and many other things in the area which I could
get so easily for the research work of scientists."

<HEADLINE> Palestinian GNP, GDP Up in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Gross National Product
(GNP) for the Palestinian areas rose by 3.5 percent to reach 4,235
million U.S. dollars in 1998 over 1997, a report issued recently by
the Palestinian Monetary Authority said.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
climed 2 percent to reach 4,030 million dollars in 1998 over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
But the per capita GDP declined from 1,430 dollars in 1997 to
1,380 in 1998 due to population growth, it added.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1998, Palestinian population in the West Bank,
including East Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip was recorded at almost 3
million.
</P>
<P>
In general, the report said, the economic situation in 1998 was
better than that of 1997 in view of the lowered unemployment rate,
which dropped from 20 percent in 1997 to 16.2 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The labor force was recorded at about 560,000 at the end of
1998 in the Palestinian territories, indicating 30,000 more people
seek job opportunities each year. It takes an investment of
15,000 dollars to employ one person.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian areas need an annual investment of 450 million
dollars to maintain the employment at its current rate and an
estimated 2 billion to overcome the unployment problem, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) is exerting all
efforts to develop the economy, hoping the opening of the Gaza
Airport will give confidence to expatriate investors and
businessmen to come to Palestine to invest, it said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign currency reserves increased by 6 percent in 1998
to reach at 253 million dollars over the year earlier.
</P>
<P>
There have been 22 banks operating in the Palestinian
territories by the end of 1998, with nine of the Palestine, eight
of Jordan, two of Egypt and one of Israel in Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
The report also said the territories need an additional 200 bank
branches to reach the level of one branch serving 15,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Bank capital increased by 3 percent, or 6 million dollars, to
reach 222 million by the end of 1998 while customer deposits
increased by 16 percent, or 325 million dollars, from 2,090
million in 1997 to 2,415 million in 1998, it said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Malta Stresses Stability in Mediterranean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Maltese Foreign
Minister Guido De Marco Sunday underlined the importance of
maintaining stability in the Mediterranean region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, De Marco said the stability in the Mediterranean
and Europe are inseparable.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no stability in Europe without stability in the
Mediterranean region," De Marco, who is also Maltese Deputy Prime
Minister, stressed.
</P>
<P>
The 15 member states of the European Union and 12 Mediterranean
countries, including Malta and Egypt, join the Euro-Med
partnership, which is designed to enhance economic, political,
social and security cooperation among the members.
</P>
<P>
Next month, Malta will host a meeting of the Mediterranean
Forum set up under an Egyptian initiative, De Marco said, adding
that the forum will discuss issues relating to the Barcelona
process.
</P>
<P>
The Maltese minister, who arrived here Thursday on a five-day
visit, led a 25-member delegation of businessmen and
representatives from trade and industrial firms.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa met with De Marco Saturday
night, during which they signed two pacts on eliminating tax
duplicity and evasion, and promoting and protecting investments,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Moussa expressed hope
that the accords will help promote the bilateral trade and
economic relations, MENA said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Government Urged to Intake More Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Australian local governments
and business circle urged the federal government to intake more
immigrants, Prime Minister John Howard Sunday promised to listen
to business lobby's argument.
</P>
<P>
However, Howard said his government had already achieved the
right balance, "the current level of immigration was appropriate
for Australia's social and economic circumstances," according to
reports by Australian Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before a visit to New Zealand, Howard said the federal
government had shifted away from an undue emphasis on family
reunion to a greater emphasis on skilled and business migration.
</P>
<P>
"But I am quite happy for there to be a debate, I don't think
the issue is one where a sudden shift in policy makes sense, but I
am prepared to listen to arguments."
</P>
<P>
Opposition immigration spokesman Con Sciacca has backed the
business lobby push for an annual intake of 123,000 immigrants in
the next financial year - 43,000 more than the intake for the
current year.
</P>
<P>
Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett backed the call, saying
immigration to Australia was "ridiculously low" and that the issue
had been badly addressed in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Territory (NT) government also joined the team
backing an increase in immigration rate, saying the current intake
was too low to support potential economic growth.
</P>
<P>
NT Asian Relations Minister Daryl Manzie said a greater number
of skilled migrants were needed to alleviate the territory's
skilled worker shortage.
</P>
<P>
"Australia's current migrant intake is too low to support our
potential economic growth, if we are to become an economic
powerhouse in the next century, I wholly support a bipartisan
approach to reviewing current immigration policy."

people, of his country and of the South Pacific region."

Lini had steered Vanuatu to independence and was known
affectionately as the father of independence, Howard said.
</P>
<P>
"Committed to his country, he was also a major figure in the
South Pacific region and made an important contribution to the
region's development.
</P>
<P>
"Successive Australian governments enjoyed a close and
productive relationship with Father Walter Lini and part of his

LONDON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Thames River is to be dammed on millennium night,
December 31 of this year, to create a giant lagoon for a floating
carnival in the heart of London. A flotilla of vessels from across
the ages will take to the pond-like surface, a spokesman for the
New Millennium Experience Company said.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Opposition politicians and Green groups condemned Tony Blair
on Saturday after the Prime Minister renewed his support for
controversial genetically modified food and crops.
</P>
<P>
The Independent on Sunday:
</P>
<P>
-- Faced by political progress but military deadlock, leading
powers on Saturday night extended their deadline for a peace deal
in Kosovo until Tuesday. But the prospects of a final accord still
seemed tenuous at best.
</P>
<P>
The Observer:
</P>
<P>
-- Suspected paedophiles and incompetent care-takers could be
banned from working near children for life on the word of a single
employer, under legislation before the members of parliament this
week. The ban would cover those who neglect children in their
professional care as well as those suspected of sexual
interference.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urged to Help Stop U.S.-British Strikes on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 21 (Xinhua)-- An Iraqi daily has called upon
the U.N. General secretariat to live up to its ethical
responsibility and help halt the recurrent U.S.-British aggression
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Al-Thawra daily, organ of the ruling Arab Baath Socialist
Party, said in Sunday's editorial that the on-going U.S.-British
aggression against Iraq threatened regional security and stability.
</P>
<P>
Their aggression also encourages the spread of the law of
jungle in the international relations and dismantles foundations on
which the collective security system is based, said the editorial.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched air strikes against Iraq in
mid-December to retaliate what they claimed the Iraqi
non-cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors in charge of eliminating
Iraq's banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
After those attacks, Iraq announced that it does not recognize
the no-fly zones imposed by the U.S.-led western allies following
the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the Kurds in
the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from Baghdad's
suppression.
</P>
<P>
Since then clashes between Iraqi air defense units and
U.S.-British warplanes patrolling these restricted zones have
almost become daily occurrence.
</P>
<P>
The editorial made it clear that the anti-Iraq aggression
was considered as a flagrant breach of the Memorandum of
Understanding concluded between Iraq and the U.N. which put
stress on the necessity of respecting Iraq's sovereignty and
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
It said that U.S.-British aggression led to killing more
civilians in Iraq and destroying their properties and intimidating
the population of towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
It complained that though U.S.-British aggression is a blatant
and overt encroachment on Iraq's sovereignty and a direct threat
to its stability, but the U.N. has failed to adopt any decisive
act towards that according to its duties and responsibilities.

<HEADLINE> No Alternatives to Palestinian State: Egyptian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa has maintained that there are no alternatives to a future
independent Palestinian state, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the remarks Saturday night at a joint press
conference held with his Maltese counterpart Guido De Marco after
a meeting.
</P>
<P>
He denied a report that Palestinian President Yasser Arafat has
asked Egypt to host a meeting of Palestinian factions to seek
alternatives to a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
"There is no request" made by Arafat to hold such meeting,
Moussa said, stressing that there are " no alternatives" to a
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Arafat held talks here with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Saturday on the latest developments in the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moussa later told reporters that a comprehensive peace will be
impossible in the Middle East without an independent Palestinian
state, warning that the conflict between Arab countries and Israel
"will remain open" if the Palestinian people do not have their own
state.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that May 4, 1999, is "an undisputed date" for the
Palestinians to declare an independent state, a move which is "the
undisputed right" of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has repeatedly announced he will declare an independent
state on May 4 when the five-year interim period of self-rule
expires, regardless of the results of the peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state, however, is opposed to the possible move,
denouncing it as a unilateral action and threatening to take tough
actions against the step, including annexation of parts of the
West Bank.

BEIRUT, February 21 (Xinhua) -- At least five Lebanese were
killed and 10 others wounded in a building collapse in central
Lebanon Saturday night, the Voice of People radio reported Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The five-floor building, which was built 10 years ago, lies 10
kilometers east of Beirut on the side of an international road to
Syrian capital Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Following the accident, Lebanese security forces and rescue
workers rushed to the site for evacuation.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Minister of Public Works and Transportation Najib
Mikati also arrived at the scene but refused to comment on the
reason for the breakdown.
</P>
<P>
But former Minister of Environment Akram Shuhayyeb blamed the
collapse on the strong shake caused by the passing of hundreds of
trucks on the road every day.
</P>
<P>
A special team consisting of construction and security experts
has been set up to investigate the matter.

<HEADLINE> Witnesses Unveiled for Both Sides at Intel Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Top executives from Intel
Corp. and anti-trust lawyers from the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) will testify at the Intel's anti-trust trial, set
for March 9, according to reports from the world's largest chip-
maker.
</P>
<P>
The FTC sued Intel in June, accusing it of denying three of its
competitors access to important technical information about
upcoming Intel chips. It said Intel sought to punish the
competitors for refusing to license key patents on Intel's terms.
</P>
<P>
The three companies were Digital Equipment Corp., Intergraph
Corp., and Compaq, which now owns Digital. Intergraph's chief
executive officer, James W. Meadlock, will be among two dozens of
government witnesses that include anti-trust lawyers.
</P>
<P>
Intel denied the charges and identified 18 Intel executives,
including Andrew Grove, Intel's co-founder and chairman, and Craig
Barrett, who took over as chief executive officer last year, as
well as 15 others from outside the company who will appear as
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
The FTC's case against Intel will take place in a courtroom
just blocks away from the federal courthouse where Microsoft Corp.
is fighting its own antitrust case against the U.S. Justice
Department and a group of 19 states.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Microsoft's trial, where Chairman Bill Gates has not
testified in his own company's defense, Intel put both its CEO and
former CEO on the witness list.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the large numbers of witnesses from both sides
suggest the government plans a far broader case against Intel than
originally believed, and Intel, for its part, has to put their top
guns on the stand.

NICOSIA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has fulfilled its
financial obligations to the U.N. by paying 349,151 U.S. dollars
to the Ordinary Budget of the body, the Cyprus News Agency
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus is the 40th state to settle its membership fee to the

According to a U.N. General Assembly report, the U.N. spent

Cyprus from July 1997 to June 1998.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. peacekeeping forces have been on the island since
March 1964 when inter-communal strife between the Greek and
Turkish Cypriot communities emerged.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.

<HEADLINE> Singapore SM on Singapore-Hong Kong Relations. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Senior Minister
Lee Kuan Yew Saturday dismissed as "absurd" media blitz that
Singapore wants to do Hong Kong in and stamp on Hong Kong when it
is down, local media reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said Singapore and Hong Kong will always both cooperate and
compete in the nature of their relationship and the success of one
is a spur to the greater success of the other.
</P>
<P>
Lee also pledged that Singapore would not denigrate Hong Kong
or aggravate its problems.
</P>
<P>
The senior minister made the point in his speech to some 500
grassroots leaders at a Chinese New Year dinner at Tanjong Pagar
Community here Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Lee attributed the media blitz to the stressful situation in
the Asian region as a whole and especially in Hong Kong, saying
stress over Hong Kong's situation had fanned the "absurd" media
frenzy over rivalry between Singapore and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The western media, on the other hand, played up the
competition between Hong Kong and Singapore, accentuating the
rivalry in order to prod Hong Kong toward more free-market
policies that they favor," he said.
</P>
<P>
Far from wanting to do Hong Kong in, Singapore would like it to
succeed as a successful Hong Kong would spur and benefit
Singapore, he stated.
</P>
<P>
"A successful Hong Kong is a multiplier for Singapore's
economy," he added.
</P>
<P>
The senior minister said: "Singapore had learnt from Hong
Kong's example and was liberalizing its financial sector to keep
pace with New York, London, Tokyo, Frankfurt and Hong Kong, not to
do Hong Kong in."
</P>
<P>
"We wish Hong Kong well, and will continue to be helpful
wherever we can," he said.
</P>
<P>
The senior minister said he and Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung
Chee Hwa met fruitfully during the World Economic Forum meeting in
Davos, Switzerland, last month.
</P>
<P>
He said he found Tung is optimistic about Hong Kong's
prospects, confident that Hong Kong would overcome its present
difficulties.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Govt. Urged to Invest into Ventures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has urged the Zambian government to invest borrowed money
into productive ventures.
</P>
<P>
IMF country representative, Kenneth Meyers, said in Lusaka
Saturday that Zambia's current staggering foreign debt of 70
billion U.S. Dollars is a result of the government's failure to
invest the borrowed money into productive ventures.
</P>
<P>
The problem is that the government is spending too much
borrowed money on non-productive projects, the Sunday Times of
Zambia newspaper quoted Meyers as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The best would have been to use such money on projects that
will give them a profit so that they are able to pay back," said
the IMF official.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the close of a three-day Zambia Congress
of Trade Unions (ZCTU) national seminar on the new project
approach to the structural adjustment program in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He noted that for a long time, the labor movement had been left
out each time there were discussions concerning Zambia and he
pledged to include them in future undertakings.
</P>
<P>
"We face a common challenge and that is to reduce poverty in
Zambia and therefore all the key players should be involved in
negotiations," Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
He implored the labor movement to be more focused and prepared
when engaged in dialog with the government.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was attended by delegates from all ZCTU affiliates
and government officials from several ministries.

</P>
<P>
Lee told some 500 grassroots leaders at a Chinese New Year
dinner at the Tanjong Pagar Community Club that except for

</P>
<P>
He said South Korea and Thailand were on the mend, while
Malaysia was reporting higher foreign reserves with better trade
surpluses although bad debt problem persisted.

Singapore should be able to keep to its economic forecast of
minus one to plus one percent growth in 1999 and see a modest
economic growth of two to four percent growth in 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that if U.S. stock market falls sharply the
world will have troubles.

<HEADLINE> Dustin Hoffman Wins Life Achievement Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Dustin Hoffman, who has
won two Academy Awards for best actor, is the latest recipient of
one of the movie industry's top honors: the American Film
Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Hollywood said Saturday that the institute
presented him with its 27th Life Achievement Award and the
official tribute will be aired on ABC television later this year.
</P>
<P>
In accepting the award, Hoffman, 61, said that "it has been a
glorious orgy to be part of this century of American film."
</P>
<P>
Hoffman burst on the movie scene in 1967 as Benjamin Braddock,
a callow student who falls prey to the lustful wiles of an older
woman, Mrs. Robinson, in "The Graduate". Since then, Hoffman has
won two Academy Awards for best actor; for "Kramer vs. Kramer" in
1979, and "Rain Man" in 1988. He has also won six Oscar
nominations for best actor.
</P>
<P>
Director Sydney Pollack, who worked with Hoffman on "Tootsie",
the movie that brought him one of his six Oscar nominations, said
"his versatility, range and uncanny ability to embody the
characters he plays has amazed audiences across the globe since
his arrival on the scene more than 30 years ago."
</P>
<P>
Film critics say Hoffman made an art out of playing the angst-
ridden, ego-driven, late 20th century urban man, redefining the
anti-hero for modern-day cinema audiences.

<P>
KATHMANDU, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's National Mass
Movement Coordination Committee has decided to boycott Hindi films
in the Kathmandu Valley initially for four months from March 15 to
July 15, The Kathmandu Post said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The daily said the decision was made after several rounds of
interaction programs with cine-artists, directors, producers and
cinema-hall entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
It said that cine-actors and directors welcomed the committee's
commitment to promote Nepali films and culture.
</P>
<P>
"The decision is aimed at the promotion and protection of
Nepali films and culture," the daily said, quoting a press release
issued by the committee.
</P>
<P>
"Nepali film industry can also play an important role to
promote and develop Nepali art and culture," the press release
said. "But due to massive influx of Hindi films inside the
country, this industry is facing crisis. If the present situation
continues to remain, our budding film industry will collapse."
</P>
<P>
The committee called for the government to form a film
development board, recognize film industry as a national industry
and formulate policies to preserve Nepali films in order to make
the nation's film industry self-dependent, the English-language
daily said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Import 165,000 Tons of Sugar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
import 165,000 tons of sugar to meet the country's demand in the
current July 1998-June 1999 fiscal year as its production is going
to face setbacks in the current crushing season.
</P>
<P>
The government has already given permission to the Bangladesh
Sugar and Food Industries Corporation (BSFIC) to do this, The
Financial Express daily newspaper Sunday quoted competent sources
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The country's sugar production is unlikely to achieve the
target during this crushing season as the recovery rate has fallen
due to lack of availability of quality sugarcane for crushing.
</P>
<P>
The recovery rate of sugar from the crushed sugarcane is
showing a sharp downtrend this season as quality of sugarcane was
badly affected due to the most serious floods the country
experienced in a century last year.
</P>
<P>
The country's 15 sugar mills under the BSFIC started production
since October last year in phases with a revised production target
of 186,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
So far, the mills have been able to produce some 125,000 tons,
they noted, adding that the total production is likely to stand at
about 150,000 tons during the season.
</P>
<P>
The BSFIC has taken a series of measures to boost the supply of
sugarcane for the mills along with ensuring fresh sugarcane to
help increase the recovery rate of sugar.
</P>
<P>
The corporation has directed the sugar mills to make spot
payments to sugarcane growers to encourage them for selling their
crops to the mills.
</P>
<P>
Out of annual domestic requirement for 600,000 tons, 120,000
tons of sugar is produced locally while the government imports
about 130,000 tons every year. The rest of 350,000 tons of sugar
is smuggled into the domestic markets from neighboring countries.

ZAGREB, February 20, (Xinhua) -- Carlos Westendorp, High
Representative of the Peace Implementation Council of Bosnia,
authorized the Bosnian Presidency the Supreme Commander of the
military forces of the Republic of Bosina-Herzegovina on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Westendorp made the authorization in a letter to the three
members of the Bosnian Presidency in accordance with the Dayton
Peace Agreement and the Bosnia-Herzegovina constitution.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton Agreement, which was concluded towards the end
of 1995 for peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Bosnian Presidency
consisted of three members, with each from one ethnic group and
the top vote-receiver being the chairman of the presidency for two
years.
</P>
<P>
Zivko Radisiv is now chairman of the Bosnian Presidency, with
Ante Jelavic and Alija Izetbegovic being the other two members.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the authorization made by Westendorp
virtually stripped the President of the Bosnian Muslim-Croat
Federation and the President of the Serb Republic of Bosnia-
Herzegovina of the power over their own military forces.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the High Representative's office in
Sarajevo said that Westendorp made it clear in the letter that the
three-member Bosnian Presidency functions collectively as the
supreme commander of the military forces, not just the chairman of
the presidency.

<P>
COLOMBO, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
set up a new propaganda unit in a move to enhance its publicity
campaign for the upcoming elections, informed sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Policy Research and Information Unit (PRIU) is directly
under the administrative control of the Presidential Secretariat,
the sources said.

<P>
Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga has named her
Additional Secretary Cyril Gunapala as secretary general of the

of the PRIU and voted 15 million rupees (220,000 U.S. dollars) for
immediate expenditure.

elections to five provincial councils on April 1. In addition,
both parliamentary and presidential elections are scheduled for
next year.
</P>

In the aftermath of the North Western provincial elections,
President Kumaratunga severely criticized the role of the state

<HEADLINE> Thai Transport Ministry to Borrow Funds from Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Transport and
Communication Ministry of Thailand is to borrow some 35.7 billion
baht (991 million U.S. dollars) from Japan's special yen loan
package to fund six highway and railway projects, a source from
the ministry said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Among the six projects, three are for highway, including a
bypass in southern Bangkok, the installation of traffic management
and toll collection system for a motorway from Bangkok to eastern
province of Chonburi, and similar installations for Bangkok's
eastern bypass.
</P>
<P>
The other three projects are for railway service, including
northern parallel track, maintenance of existing northern and
southern tracks, and a project to design northeastern and southern
parallel tracks.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has also prepared two additional projects which
may rely on the special yen loan package if possible.
</P>
<P>
The details of the six projects will be forwarded to the
Finance Ministry, which would discuss Thailand's request for the
loan package with Japan in April.
</P>
<P>
Japan had arranged a package worth 180 billion baht (5 billion
dollars) to help Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia restore their
economy. The package carries a one-percent annual interest and a
repayment period of 40 years, with the first 10 years free of
interest.
</P>
<P>
Debtors receiving the financial support must allow Japan-led
contractors to handle at least 85 percent of their projects based
on the cost, and transport-related projects are preferable.

<HEADLINE> THAI Proposes to Increase Air Fare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The management of Thai Airways
International (THAI) has proposed to increase domestic air fare by
13.5 percent, an official from the airline said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The increase is to meet the Transport and Communication
Ministry's directive, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The 13.5 percent increase will cause domestic fares to rise by
about 200 baht (5.6 U.S. dollars) per trip on every route.
</P>
<P>
The management would forward the increase to the airline's
board of directors late this month.
</P>
<P>
If the board endorses the proposal, it will forward the matter
to the ministry's Civil Aviation Board for final approval so that
the airline can introduce a new air fare rate later.
</P>
<P>
With the current fare, THAI was facing losses on almost all its
domestic routes.
</P>
<P>
However, THAI said it would not raise the fares of its
international flight services in the near future because of high
competition from other international airlines.
</P>
<P>
To become more competitive, THAI is trying to reduce operating
costs by reducing the types of aircraft in its fleet.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Identify Gene for DiGeorge Syndrome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. researchers have found
that the lack of a gene is probably blamed for the DiGeorge
syndrome, the second most common genetic cause of congenital heart
defects, reported the Science Friday.
</P>
<P>
DiGeorge syndrome is also known as chromosome 22 deletion
syndrome. Babies born with this syndrome could suffer
malformations in the heart, the face and the thymus, a gland that
is a vital part of the immune system.
</P>
<P>
About one in every 4000 children suffer the disease.
</P>
<P>
The researchers from the Southwestern Medical Center of the
University of Texas, led by Dr. Deepak Srivastava, discovered that
the disease could be caused when a child lacked one of two genes
called UDF1. They found that of 182 DiGeorge syndrome patients
examined, all lacked one copy of the UDF1 gene.
</P>
<P>
The Science said the discovery is an important step toward
finding new treatments for the disease.

BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region, an area with abundant wind power resources, has raised its
installed wind power capacity to 40,000 kw by pooling funds from
both home and abroad, "Guangming Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The region imported the first 11 wind power generators from the
United States with 970,000 U.S. dollars. Later it used 1 million U.
S. dollars in loan offered by German Government to buy four 250-kw
wind power generators which started operation in 1993 with an
annual output of 2.2 million kwh of electricity.
</P>
<P>
The region bought another four 250-kw wind power generators
with 7 million yuan provided by the central government in 1994 and
imported 28 generators with a combined wind power capacity of 16,
300 kw with loans from Denmark, the Netherlands and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
A local government official said that the wind power generating
capacity of Inner Mongolia is expected to reach 200,000 kw which
can produce 540 million kwh of electricity by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
China has 253 million kw of potential wind power resources. The
country's goal is to increase wind power capacity to one million
kilowatts by 2000. China has already developed a great number of
large and small wind-power generators, with a total capacity of
200,000 kw.

<P>
COLOMBO, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has appointed a commission to inquire into alleged
malpractices and abuses during the North Western Provincial
Council (NWPC) polls which were held on January 25.
</P>
<P>
The commission will comprise former Supreme Court Judge Ananda
Coomaraswamy and former Judge of the Court of Appeal N. Abeyweera,
reported the official Sunday Observer.
</P>
<P>
It will receive information from all parties concerned on the
alleged malpractices and abuse, inquire into complaints and submit
a report to the president, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report added that the president has directed the commission
to forward a report to her within two months.
</P>
<P>
The ruling People's Alliance (PA) won 30 seats out of 52 in the
bitterly contested NWPC elections, beating the main opposition
United National Party (UNP) and others. The UNP got 19 seats and
the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) obtained three seats.
</P>
<P>
The declaration of the results raised protests from opposition
parties and religious leaders who charged the PA of rigging the
elections and demanded cancellation of election results.
</P>
<P>
However, the government denied the allegations and instead
charged the UNP of resorting to violence.
</P>
<P>
The UNP and the JVP have also declared that they would boycott
the new NWPC.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the president pledged that she would order an
investigation into the allegations.

<HEADLINE> Kurds Continue Protests in Germany Despite Government Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 13,000 Kurds in
Germany continued their mass rallies and demonstrations despite a
government ban on Saturday, demanding the release of the Kurdish
Workers Party leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
No violence was reported in the rallies and demonstrations, but
the growing scale of the protest activities made the authorities
worry, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, about 7,000 Kurds took to the streets, while in
Stuttgart, Bochum, and Bielefeld, Kurds continued to stage more
rallies and demonstrations. In addition, two arson attacks on
Turkish interests and stores were carried out overnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
The German authorities earlier reiterated warnings against the
Kurdish protesters, vowing to take stern measures to deal with
violent acts.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said troublemakers would be
treated "with the total rigor of the law and judicial process"
while politicians called for an early expulsion of Kurdish
militants from Germany.
</P>
<P>
Now, opposition parties were urging the federal government to
strike an agreement with the Turkish authorities as soon as
possible to exempt the Kurds from legal actions against them after
their repatriation from Germany.
</P>
<P>
German Interior Minister Otto Schily promised to make contact
with the Turkish authorities, but did not agree to attach any
condition to the repatriation process.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, head of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) who
had been hiding in the Greek embassy in Kenya, was captured by
Turkey on February 15. He faces terrorism charges for his
leadership of the PKK in its 15-year armed struggle for a Kurdish
homeland in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
A wave of Kurdish protests swept across Europe following his
arrest, which some reports said was linked to U.S. and Israeli
secret services.

<HEADLINE> Life Insurance Becomes Necessity in Guangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 21 (Xinhua) -- There were more than 6.86
million life insurance policy holders in this capital of south
China's Guangdong Province last year, despite it only having a
population of 6.6 million.
</P>
<P>
This has been attributed to an increasing awareness of the "
Aging Problem". More people in Guangzhou have decided to put aside
10-15 percent of their income in insurance to help them through
their senior years.
</P>
<P>
This concept of individual budget has helped swell the life
insurance business in the city. So far, 73 percent of employees in
the state-owned sectors have bought old age insurance, and an
increasing number of people in private and foreign-funded
businesses are expected to do likewise soon.
</P>
<P>
Senior citizens over 60 account for 12 percent of the city's
total population, and estimates show they will make up 25 percent
in the year 2030. Insurers are offering policies with an
installment payment term of 20 years and urging people to take up
the option immediately.
</P>
<P>
In addition to old age policies, those for medical cover also
have big potential and are luring many foreign insurers. Germany's
DKV Co. has joined hand with China Ping'an Insurance Co. in
promoting medical insurance policies suitable for Chinese people.

<HEADLINE> Uruguay to Propose Lift of Commercial Barriers at Mercosur Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay will propose
measures to eliminate barriers to the intra-regional commerce at
the Mercosur meeting on Sunday, said official sources.
</P>
<P>
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, the four members of
the customs union Mercosur (the South American Common Market),
will hold their first official meeting in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday
since Brazil devalued its currency by nearly 40 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was aimed to analyze the economic and financial
situation of the common market after the Brazilian currency
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay, Brazil's main trade partner, exported almost one
billion dollars worth of products to Brazil last year, 30 percent
of its total sales abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Uruguayan exports to Brazil were practically paralyzed from
the middle of last January after the devaluation.
</P>
<P>
Economy Minister Luis Mosca admitted that the Uruguayan economy
could enter into recession this year with a moderate growth of 1
percent, while economic analysts forecast a drop of 1 to 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Uruguayan government and business sector repeatedly
requested Brazil to lift restrictions on the imports from the bloc
countries.
</P>
<P>
Simultaneously with the Mercosur Summit, a Mercosur-European
Union Entrepreneurial Forum will be held in Rio de Janeiro, to be
attended by Foreign Affairs and Economy ministers.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur and the European Union signed in 1996 a document in
which both sides committed themselves to negotiating a
transoceanic free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
Created in January 1995, Mercosur is Latin America's leading
customs union and the fourth-biggest trading group in the world
with some 200 million people. Bolivia and Chile are associate
members.

</P>
<P>

into zones, where the military troops would be in neighborhoods
and villages to build and give maintenance to roads and schools,
among other tasks.
</P>
<P>
He also called on students, professionals, private enterprises,
the church, newsmen, governors, and all the civil societies and

<HEADLINE> "La Nina" To Extend Cold Wave in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Environmental
and Meteorological Studies Institute (IDEAM) said on Saturday that
the strong rains falling in several regions of the country will
last 72 hours more as a consequence of the intensification of the
"La Nina" phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
IDEAM information chief Humberto Gonzalez revealed that the
present winterlike situation in the country is an anomaly. Usually,
the rain season ends at March, but this time it will extend until
April.
</P>
<P>
One of the characteristics of the "La Nina" phenomenon is the
cooling of the surface layers of the Pacific Ocean waters, which
has reached its top value.
</P>
<P>
"The 'La Nina' phenomenon has caused this unusual persistence
of the rains at a time that normally is dry and sunny in most
parts of the country" explained Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
The IDEAM declared yellow alert because of the possibility of
rivers outflowing in the zone of the "coffee hub," south of
Antioquia, center of Huila, center and west of Boyaca,
Cundinamarca, Los Llanos, and Santander.
</P>
<P>
The meteorological authorities also recommended Colombians to
be very careful when crossing rivers and gullies, to test the
physical structures of buildings, and watch the behavior of the
rivers.

<HEADLINE> New Bridge Across River Opened in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- A new bridge across Myanmar's
Thanlwin River, the Tasan Bridge, linking the country's southern
and eastern Shan state was put into service on Saturday to
facilitate transport in the region.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Chairman of the Myanmar State Peace and Development
Council and Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Defense Services and
Commander-in-Chief of the Army General Maung Aye inaugurated the
bridge, official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The suspension bridge, which connects Mongtung and Mongpan
townships of the state, is 270 meters long and 5 meters wide and
can bear 36 tons of load.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the bridge began in April 1997 and
completed last month at a cost of over 1 million U.S. dollars plus
250 million Kyats (833,300 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Since late 1988, three bridges across the Thanlwin River have
been built. These are Takaw-ek Bridge in northern Shan state,
Hpa-an Bridge in Kayin state and the present Tasan Bridge.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar also implemented six major bridge projects across the
country's Ayeyawaddy River since then. Of these, four have been
completed which are Myaungmya, Nawahtay, Maubin and Bala Minhtin.

<HEADLINE> Cheating Players to Be Automatically Booked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Any players cheating, diving or
feigning injury will be automatically booked fro next season, the
sport's law-making International Board said in LLantrisant, Wales
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The decision widens the scope for referees who up to now handed
out yellow cards for ungentlemanly conduct, but still had
discretion if they thought cheating was involved.
</P>
<P>
Under the modification to Law 12, "simulating action" anywhere
on the field intended to deceive the referee will be deemed
unsporting behaviour and punished by a yellow card.
</P>
<P>
David Collins, the general secretary of the Football
Association of Wales, who hosted the meeting said: "Last year FIFA
took action against the tackle from behind and now we are going
further in cleaning up the game.
</P>
<P>
"It was apparent at the World Cup in France that simulating
action, or feigning injury, or diving, was causing undue problems
and FIFA felt it necessary to take action against that wherever it
may happen on the field of play."
</P>
<P>
The Board also gave its approval for the introduction of an
experiment using two referees to control matches, and said the
trial would start soon and take place in a top division, probably
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"The experiment will start next season, but exactly how it
works and in what country it will be held will be decided after
the referee's sub-committee has met later," said Collins.
</P>
<P>
But the Board shied away from introducing long-term and
widespread experiments with goal-line technology for at least
another year.
</P>
<P>
"We have the capability now of using extremely hi-tech systems
but they are extremely costly to operate. However, an experiement
which has been used at Sheffield Wednesday in England will
continue for another season and we will consider wider
experimentation in a year's time," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Board also said it was continuing with an experiment which
has been operating in Jersey for the last year of, rugby-style,
advancing a free-kick 9.15 meters (10 yards) if the defending team
does not retreat that distance when the kick is first awarded.
</P>
<P>
David Davies, the acting chief executive of the English F.A.
under whose auspices the Jersey experiment has been run said: "
This experiment has had a spectacular impact on cutting down on
dissent and has been very successful so far. We now intend
widening it and using it in another country and in a FIFA
competition next season."
</P>
<P>
However, FIFA have ended the kick-in experiment which has been
operating in the Belgian Second Division for the past three
seasons and will be taking no further action on that.
</P>
<P>
FIFA have also given the fourth official greater powers -- and
said that a fourth official will now be appointed for matches in
every major division.
</P>
<P>
The official will also now be empowered to check the equipment
and kit of players and also be able to contact the referee
directly rather than having to go through one of the linesmen.
</P>
<P>
The Board, meeting for the 113th time, is soccer's law making
body and comprises four FIFA members and the four British
associations.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, February 21 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei
Province has become a new spot of investment for transnational
corporations in recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to recent statistics, the province has attracted 81
transnational companies with a total investment of 5.01 billion U.
S. dollars, accounting for 38 percent of the province's total
overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 41 transnational companies built 112 enterprises in
Hebei Province with 2.13 billion U.S. dollars of contracted
investment, equivalent to the combined investment of previous
three years, said Shi Rongyao, a provincial government official.
</P>
<P>
Among these companies, big names include Philips, Siemens,
Mitsubishi and Daewoo. Their average investment for each project
has increased from 8 million U.S. dollars in the early 1990s to
present 13 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Shi cited a favorable investment policy, simplified procedures
and good performance of operational firms as the main reasons for
the influx of overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Productive enterprises opened by these transnational companies
gained an output value of 21 billion yuan last year, up 21 percent
over the previous year. Their sales income climbed 29 percent to
31.2 billion yuan last year.

<HEADLINE> FIFA May Overturn Arsenal Replay Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The world soccer governing body
FIFA will decide whether the replayed FA Cup match between Arsenal
and Sheffield United goes ahead on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
FIFA could overturn the English FA's decision to replay the
match after Arsenal won the original tie with a Marc Overmars goal
which was legal but not in the spirit of the game.
</P>
<P>
The news came at a meeting of the law-making International
Board in Wales although the FA remain confident that the match
will be replayed.
</P>
<P>
Fifa's general secretary Michael Zen-Ruffinen said: "We have
set up an investigation to consider whether the FA was within its
rights to order the match to be replayed as no laws were
technically broken.
</P>
<P>
"If the FA were not in their rights to order a replay, under
the terms of the FA Cup competition, then the result of the
original match should stand and the replay will not go ahead.
</P>
<P>
"The match is scheduled for Tuesday and a meeting of FIFA's
senior administration, or the Emergency Committee, will consider
the matter by Monday at the latest."
</P>
<P>
Zen-Ruffinen told BBC Radio 5 Live: "If we have to take a
decision which is unpopular then we will have to do that.
</P>
<P>
"I mean the referee has to do that every match and FIFA is a
kind of referee in terms of the litigation which arises from the
football family."
</P>
<P>
But FA interim chief executive David Davies said: "I am certain
we have broken none of our own rules regarding the structure of
the FA Cup competition.
</P>
<P>
"That is the issue here. We have sole ownership of the FA Cup
and while FIFA are doing this to satisfy themselves I am certain
the match will go ahead as planned."
</P>
<P>
Arsenal expect to go ahead with the replay despite FIFA's
announcement.
</P>
<P>
Managing director Ken Friar said: "The FA have given permission
for us to re-stage the game on Tuesday and as far as we are
concerned it will go ahead as planned."

<HEADLINE> Williams Gets First Career Win Over Graf in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 20 (Xinhua)-- American Venus Williams
Saturday achieved her first career victory over Steffi Graf on her
opponent's home soil in Germany, and with the 6-3, 3-6, 6-3
triumph reached the final of the 500,000 dollars Grand Prix
tournament in Hanover.
</P>
<P>
The second-seeded Williams on Sunday meets top seed Jana
Novotna of the Czech Republic, who outlasted Russian Elena
Likhovtseva 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 in the first semifinal and is now in
the final for the fifth straight time.
</P>
<P>
World number six Williams had lost her first two meetings with
the former world number one Graf, but had a dream start on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Williams raced off to a 3-0 lead with her sheer unlimited
baseline power and wrapped up the set in 43 minutes.
</P>
<P>
But Graf, who is steadily climbing up the rankings to a current
number seven ranking after a long injury layoff, rallied to force
a third set.
</P>
<P>
There Williams broke for 2-0, but had to suffer a re-break
instantly. However, the American broke again for 5-3 and then
served out the match at love, wrapping up matters with an ace
after two hours one minute of play.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, she runs into the reigning Wimbledon champion
Novotna, who squandered a 4-2 lead in the first set and needed to
fight from break down twice in the second set before prevailing
after one hour 48 minutes on a double fault from Likhovtseva.
</P>
<P>
"She surprised me with her aggressiveness and did not allow me
to play my game," admitted Novotna, a serve and volley specialist.

<HEADLINE> India Wants to Have Sustained Talks with Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAHORE (Pakistan), February 20 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee said here Saturday night that India
wanted to have sustained discussions with Pakistan on all
outstanding issues including Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"As part of the composite dialogue process, we welcome it",
Vajpayee said while speaking at the banquet hosted in his honor by
his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif at Lahore Fort.
</P>
<P>
"I have brought but one message from India that there can be no
greater legacy that we can leave behind than to do away with
mistrust, to abjure and eliminate conflict, to erect an edifice of
durable peace amity, harmony and cooperation," the prime minister
said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence that through combined efforts of
the two countries, they will succeed in doing so, no matter how
hard they have to work in achieving it.
</P>
<P>
"My regret is that we have spent so much time in mutual
bitterness," he said, adding "it is unworthy of two nations the
size of India and Pakistan to have wasted so much time in mutual
ill-will."
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said the bus service between New Delhi and Lahore is
not a means only to ease travel from one country to another. The
running of the bus between the two countries symbolizes the desire
of the peoples to improve relations and come together, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries have engaged within the composite
dialogue process to work out mechanisms to ensure that
humanitarian concerns are addressed quickly, possibilities of
economic and commercial cooperation such as sale of power are
identified and pursued, and confidence building measures are
discussed and agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
But this marks only a beginning, he said, adding "we will,
together, give directions to our officials to accelerate what we
have jointly set in motion."
</P>
<P>
He said he was convinced that there is nothing in their
bilateral relations that can ever be resolved through violence.
The solution of complex, outstanding issues can only be sought in
an atmosphere free from prejudice and by adopting the path of
balance, moderation and realism, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vajpayee extended invitation to Nawaz Sharif to
visit India. He assured the Pakistani prime minister that he will
find in India a very warm welcome.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to receiving you soon in India," Vajpayee
said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian prime minister expressed his best wishes for
progress and prosperity of Pakistan, for the establishment of
durable peace and cooperation between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
This is the first visit by an Indian prime minister to Pakistan
in ten years. When he inspected the guard of honor and saw the
beautiful panorama of the setting sun, Vajpayee said he was
overwhelmed by mixed feelings. It gave him joy that he was
returning here after 21 years with the message of friendship, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"As we approach a new millennium, the future beckons us. It
calls upon us, indeed demands of us, to think of the welfare of
our children and their children, and of the generations that are
yet to come," the Indian prime minister said.

WASHINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Miami Heat continued to

fourth time in six days, 81-71 over the Houston Rockets today in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
P.J. Brown totaled 24 points and 15 rebounds for Miami, which

period. Blue Edwards' basket with 11:30 to play gave the Heat
their biggest lead, 62-46.
</P>
<P>
Othella Harrington had 17 points and 12 rebounds for Houston,
which closed to 66-62 on rookie Cuttino Mobley's free throw with 5:
46 to play could get no closer.
</P>
<P>
Scottie Pippen could not score for the first 32 minutes and
netted 10 points and one assist in 42 minutes. Hakeem Olajuwon got
16 points for the Rocket.

<HEADLINE> Pak PM Reiterates Right of Self-Determination for Kashmiris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAHORE (Pakistan), February 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif Saturday said that the Kashmiri people must
be allowed to exercise their right of self-determination as
pledged to them by the international community.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the banquet hosted by him in honor of visiting
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee at Lahore Fort, Sharif
said the Jammu and Kashmir dispute is the root cause of tensions
between Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
"It cannot be wished away and has to be resolved consistent
with their international obligations, justice and equity," said
Sharif.
</P>
<P>
"It is the disease and not the symptom that we have to
address, only then can the healing process begin," he added.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, he said, the two countries will continue to remain
trapped in this situation of conflict. It is with this realization
that the two countries have to resolve the Kashmir dispute which
has been at the core of the differences between Pakistan and India
since their inception in 1947.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said that with the nuclear tests by India and Pakistan
last year, the tensions between the two countries assumed
dangerous proportions.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said that as nuclear weapons states, Pakistan and India
need to put in place credible confidence building measures for the
avoidance of conflict. In this unstable environment, it is
incumbent on the two countries to work towards restraint and
stabilization in the spheres of nuclear and conventional
armaments, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sharif called for entering a new race - not an arms race - but
a race for the social and economic development of the region.
</P>
<P>
"We have the resources. We have the skills. We have the
manpower and we constitute a market of more than a billion
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason for us to lag behind. It is for us to
harness our enormous assets. With firm determination we should
devote our energies for ensuring a better life for our people,"
said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Sharif was confident that Vajpayee's visit will have a positive
outcome. This, he added, "is essential for the good of our people
and their future."
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee arrived at Wagah, a border checkpost located around 22
kilometers east of Lahore, Saturday afternoon on an inaugural
trans-border bus for a two-day visit to Pakistan. He is the first
Indian prime minister to visit the South Asian neighbor in a
decade.

SAN JOSE, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica Judicial
Investigation Organization (OIJ) agents seized a total of 441
kilograms of cocaine in an operation, said police authorities
Saturday.
</P>

The operation was carried out in two actions.
</P>
<P>
The OIJ seized 318 kilograms of cocaine and detained a Costa

The OIJ agents searched Friday the houses of the two fugitive
suspects and seized 123 kilograms of drug there.

<HEADLINE> Kurds Stage Pro-Ocalan March in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police said 5,400 people attended the rally, which passed off
peacefully with no arrests.
</P>
<P>
The protest came one day after 79 Kurds appeared in court over
the three-day occupation of the Greek Embassy in London.
</P>
<P>
Marchers carried pictures of Ocalan, and waved Kurdish flags
and placards bearing slogans such as "Stop arms sales to Turkey"
and "Free Ocalan - free Kurdistan."
</P>
<P>
Saturday's march comes at the end of an extraordinary week of
protests.
</P>
<P>
Several police officers carried fire extinguishers, apparently
in case any demonstrators attempted to set themselves on fire.
</P>
<P>
A 15-year-old schoolgirl suffered severe burns after setting
herself on fire on the first day of the embassy protest. The girl
is recovering after undergoing major skin surgery.
</P>
<P>
A wave of protests, in Britain and around the world, was
sparked by the arrest of Ocalan, who was seized at the start of
the week by Turkish security forces.
</P>
<P>
The 79 Kurds arrested by police after the embassy siege were
charged with violent disorder after appearing at Horseferry Road
magistrates on Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
Seventy protesters were granted conditional bail and nine were
remanded in custody after a four-hour session across four
courtrooms.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday morning, the 79 Kurds forced their way into the
Greek Embassy in west London in protest against the role Greece
played in the arrest of Ocalan, who was detained in Kenya on his
way from Greek Embassy in Nairobi to the airport.
</P>
<P>
The siege of the mission ended peacefully on Thursday afternoon
after those inside gave themselves up to the police and were all
taken to police for questioning.

<HEADLINE> Uruguayan Fisheries Affected by Brazilian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The reduction of exports to Brazil has paralyzed 20 percent of
the 100-ship Uruguayan fishing fleet.
</P>
<P>
The Uruguayan fishing industry exported an approximate average
of 100 million dollars worth of fishing products a year during
this decade, most of which go to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
However, after the devaluation of the Brazilian currency, the
real, last January, business with Brazil diminished.
</P>
<P>
Uruguayan fishing entrepreneurs have demanded the government to
implement measures to reduce the costs of the sector and raise the
competitiveness of their products in the foreign markets.

<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Several thousand Kurds
demonstrated Saturday in downtown Stockholm in a continued show of
support for their rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, who was captured
and brought home Tuesday by Turkey from Kenya.
</P>
<P>
About 6,000 Kurds traveled from across Sweden to gather in the
Swedish capital and take part the demonstration called by a
Kurdish organization known as the Kurdish Peace Committee.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators demanded the United Nations move Ocalan to a
third country to be tried by an international tribunal.
</P>
<P>
They also wanted European countries to send a mission to Turkey
and the regions where the Kurds live to monitor the situation
there.
</P>
<P>
Kurds broke into Greek diplomatic missions in Sweden Tuesday
after the Greek Embassy in Nairobi handed over Ocalan to Kenyan
authorities and then to Turkey in an undercover operation.

<HEADLINE> NATO Waits for Rambouillet Peace Talks to End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) representatives were still waiting for the
Rambouillet peace talks to produce results even though the midday
Saturday deadline had already passed by more than four hours, said
a NATO official.
</P>
<P>
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the
press that the Western military alliance was not in a position to
make a decision unless there was a clear alternative on the
outcome of the peace talks in the French castle outside Paris.
</P>
<P>
He added that NATO had been building a military presence around
the Yugoslav province of Kosovo and B-52 heavy bombers were
expected to arrive in Britain from the United States on Saturday
to put more pressure on the Yugoslav authorities. NATO blames
Yugoslavia for refusing to accept the multinational peace
implementation force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The NATO official said the Rambouillet peace deal would not be
a peace deal unless it combined the political and military aspects.
The military aspect is the deployment in Kosovo of NATO-led peace
implementation force to guarantee the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is possible to postpone the deadline for the
Rambouillet talks until a later time with the political aspect
signed first.
</P>
<P>
But the Western military alliance is prepared to take the
necessary means including, air strikes, should the situation arise,
the official said.

KUWAIT CITY, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Minister of Defense

economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Both sides discussed means to cement ties in economic and
technological fields, Swiss Ambassador Peter Hollenweger told the
Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two ministers expressed interest of their
governments to promote economic cooperation in various fields,
especially in the commercial and investment domains, Hollenweger
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Couchepin, who arrived in Riyadh late Friday for a
four-day visit, noted that his country was keen on adopting a
joint and constructive policy of partnership in the spheres of
investment, commerce and technology.
</P>

Prior to the meeting with Prince Sultan, also deputy prime

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Vote in National Assembly Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian people Saturday went to
polling stations to cast their votes for 109 senators and 360
House of Representative members before the presidential election
scheduled for next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar Saturday
commented for the first time on the candidacy of the People's
Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, who has been the
subject of criticism by political opponents.
</P>
<P>
He said of General Olusegun Obasanjo's candidacy, that "as long
as he is not a serving military personnel and is not in government
service, any Nigerian is free and at liberty to contest or vote
and be voted for."
</P>
<P>
The head of state who spoke Saturday after casting his vote in
the National Assembly election in capital Abuja noted that "we
cannot disenfranchize anybody because of his past job."
</P>
<P>
Wazini Tambasal, a Third Republic legislator, said in Abuja
that "only those who are blind would not recognize that the
country has been facing grave economic difficulties and social
problems."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the legislators should protect their integrity
and relevance by "holding the government to address these
problems, particularly the depression in the economy, the problems
of crime and collapsed infrastructure."
</P>
<P>
The election is the third in a series after the local and state
 elections held last December and in January this year under the
on-going transition program which is intended to bring to an end
the 16-year military rule in the country.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly election is being seen as a key test of
sentiment before the forthcoming presidential election in which
former Head of State General Olusegun Obasanjol takes on former
Finance Minister Olu Falae.
</P>
<P>
Crippled by years of rampant corruption and widespread
mismanagement under the military rule, Nigeria belongs to one of
the 20 poorest countries in the world despite earning billions of
Dollars a year from oil revenue.
</P>
<P>
Emejulu Ejimofor, a company accountant, said at one polling
station in Lagos that "we want to vote out the military because of
the mismanagement under the past 16 years of military rule."
</P>
<P>
Three political parties are contesting for the National
Assembly election with the People's Democratic Party (PDP) which
elected General Obasanjo as presidential candidate being dominant
in the past two elections.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly election will offer an indication of the
support to General Obasanjo who is widely seen as the leading
candidate in February 27 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The result of the election to be out late Sunday will also
prove if the alliance of the All People's Party (APP) and the
Alliance for Democracy (AD) can win more support from the
electorate than in the previous local and state elections.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that at least eight retired generals and many
other army officers are among the front-running candidates in the
National Assembly election.
</P>
<P>
Before the election, Ephraim Akpata, Chairman of the
Independent National Electoral Commission of Nigeria, said that
"unless the unexpected happens, we are going to have very
successful elections which we believe will be free and fair."
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of foreign observers, thousands of local observers and
party representatives monitored Saturday's election in the most
populous African country, which went on peacefully and orderly in
Lagos.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Urged to Control Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has to work hard to
permanently control the high inflation rate which is currently
hovering around 44 percent, a senior official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Leonard Tshumba, said
there was need for the government to come up with a law, like in
other countries, limiting the inflation rate to a certain level.
</P>
<P>
He said this when he was addressing a dinner to mark President
Robert Mugabe's 75 birthday in Bindura near Harare, the Zimbabwe
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said No meaningful development and investment would take
place in the country as long as the country continued to
experience high inflation and high interest rates, also around 44
percent.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe's inflation rate has gone up by 750 percent
over the past ten years, a situation that entailed a fall in the
value of the country's assets and people's living standards.
</P>
<P>
Tshumba said it was no use for the central bank to lend huge
sums of money to commercial banks for further disbursement to
their clients for capital development as the money would not have
much value.
</P>
<P>
"Its something we have to work hard to control permanently as
achievements made on the bases of high inflation are illusory," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation rate is not expected to come down to
anything below 30 percent by the end of the year unless the
government sticks to its targets, said Tshumba who praised the
government for drastically reducing its expenditure.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Vajpayee Embarks on Historic Visit to Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAHORE, Pakistan, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee arrived here Saturday on a two-day visit to
Pakistan at the invitation of his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz
Sharif, becoming the first Indian head of government to tour the
South Asian neighbor in a decade.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee's visit was widely hailed by the media as it has
provided a good opportunity for the leaders of the two countries
to discuss ways and means to improve the half-a-century strained
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The visit is of special significance as it is being undertaken
in the new security environment in the South Asian region,
especially after India and Pakistan conducted nuclear tests in May
last year.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee arrived at Wagah, a border checkpost located around 22
kilometers east of Lahore, capital of Punjab province, at 16:05
local time (11:05 GMT) on an inaugural trans-border bus service.
</P>
<P>
He was extended a formal courtesy as head of government soon
after his arrival. A warm welcome ceremony was held for Vajpayee
at Wagah. Military band played national anthems of the two
nations.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee, accompanied by Sharif, inspected a guard of honor.
The two leaders were dressed in their traditional national
costumes.
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony which lasted about 20 minutes, the two
leaders traveled in a white-colored helicopter to the Governor
House where they held an informal one-to-one meeting before a
state banquet hosted late in the evening by Sharif in his honor.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day weekend stay in Lahore, Vajpayee is
scheduled to have one-to-one meeting with Sharif twice. On Sunday,
the two leaders are to have a formal meeting on issues which are
confronting the two neighbors including the core issue of Jammu
and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are expected to hold a joint press conference
Sunday afternoon. A joint statement by the two countries is also
expected at the conclusion of Vajpayee's visit.
</P>
<P>
Before entering Pakistan through Wagah, Vajpayee said in a
written statement that he looks forward to "substantial talks"
with Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said that "it (the visit) is a defining moment in the
South Asian history."
</P>
<P>
"The South Asian region needs peace and harmony," said the
Indian prime minister. "Let's bury our bitterness of the past and
begin a new chapter in our relationship."
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee visited Pakistan in 1979 in the capacity of Indian
foreign minister. The ongoing visit is the third by an Indian
prime minister during the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee is scheduled to leave Lahore for New Delhi Sunday
evening.

<HEADLINE> Friendship With China, Cornerstone of Pakistan's Foreign Policy: Pak FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz said here Saturday that friendship with China will
remain the cornerstone of Pakistan's foreign policy, underlining
that the friendship between the two neighbors is a strong pillar
of peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Aziz was speaking at a banquet he hosted in honor of General
Chi Haotian, vice chairman of China's Central Military Commission,
state councilor and minister of national defense.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said Pakistan will continue to further
strengthen its ties of friendship and trust with China.
</P>
<P>
"It is our firm belief that a strong and prosperous China is a
pillar of strength for promoting the interests of developing
countries and for safeguarding international peace and security,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"China's assistance to Pakistan at critical phases of our
history has significantly contributed to our ability to defend
ourselves," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Pakistan supports China in all its causes
including the issues of Taiwan, Tibet and human rights.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, Aziz said, rejoices in and takes strength from
China's momentous success, adding that the strength and prosperity
of China serves as a guarantor of peace and stability in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that China, as this century recedes into
history and the new millennium dawns, will continue to take
determined and rapid strides for the welfare of its people and
will assume its rightful place alongside the most developed
countries of the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Based on strict adherence to the U.N. Charter and the
principles of peaceful coexistence, Pak-China friendship is a
strong pillar of peace and stability in our region, the foreign
minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We are proud of our friendship with China. We have been
friends both in weal and woe - indeed, wherever we look, we find
the footprints of Chinese friends alongside our own in the march
towards the economic progress and prosperity," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said China is recognized as a great power
by friends and foes alike.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades Deng Xiaoping's theory of building a
socialist economy with Chinese characteristics has brought
spectacular and dazzling economic development to China which has
won the admiration of the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The progress and development achieved by the Chinese people is
a tribute to their hard work and diligence as well as to the
sagacity and vision of their leaders," he added.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the banquet, General Chi Haotian said that the
friendly ties between China and Pakistan is of great significance
to peace and security of the region and the world.
</P>
<P>
"China and Pakistan are close neighbors linked by mountains and
rivers. The friendship between the two countries can be traced

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Albanians Said to Have Accepted Autonomy Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The negotiators of Kosovo
Albanians are said to have accepted with conditions a plan on
autonomy of Kosovo presented by the six-nation Contact Group in
the talks held in Rambouillet, southwest of Paris.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted a diplomatic source close to the
talks as saying that the foreign ministers of the Contact Group
are studying the response by Albanian delegates before talking
with the Serbs on the conditions put forward by the Albanian
delegates.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the agreement in principle by the Albanian
delegates was accompanied by certain number of conditions and that
their response is "extremely mixed up."
</P>
<P>
Western diplomatic sources said earlier that the tactic of
Western negotiators is to persuade the Albanians to accept the
autonomy plan, in order to increase pressure on the Serb
delegation, which up to now has refused to make concession on the
deployment of NATO troops in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Iran Opposes Laying Pipeline Through Caspian Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran reiterated Saturday its
opposition to laying pipeline through the Caspian Sea and
criticized Turkmenistan for signing a pipeline-laying contract.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said that
Iran regards the decision of Turkmenistan as contrary to the
principles already declared by the littoral states.
</P>
<P>
Asefi's words came in response to the pipeline-laying contract
signed in Ashkhabad Friday to transfer Turkmen gas, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Given the fact that the Caspian is shared by all the littoral
states in line with the 1921 and 1940 treaties between Iran and
Russia, any unilateral action concerning the sea without agreement
of all the littoral states is invalid and unacceptable from legal
point of view, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran has given high importance to the environment of
the Caspian and believes that its environment is vulnerable and
requires more attention by the littoral states.
</P>
<P>
Any violation in this respect is unacceptable, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, Iran repeatedly announced its opposition
to the project to lay pipeline through the sea, terming it as a
serious threat to the sea's environment.

RAMBOUIllET, France, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The foreign

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Allegation Over Anti-Iraq Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi Saturday dismissed as "unfounded and
baseless" an Iraqi allegation over anti-Baghdad operations from
Irainian soil.
</P>
<P>
Asefi's words came in response to the remarks made by Iraqi
Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan, who said recently in an
interview with the al-Khalij daily of the United Arab Emirates
that Iraqi dissidents had launched operations from Iranian soil
against Baghdad in the U.S.-British "Desert Fox" operations in
December.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said Tehran is regretful that Iraqi officials have made
such claim while Iran has made "ceaseless efforts" to halt
attacks on Iraqi citizens during the U.S.-British air strikes.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched air strikes on Iraq for four
consecutive nights on December 16-19 for what Washington said
punishing it for not cooperating with U.N. weapons inspectors, who
were authorized to monitor Iraq's elimination of weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said Iran respects the internationally recognized borders
and its will is based on maintaining regional stability and
security and rejecting any aggressive measure.

</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Shelton voiced condolence over the passing
of King Hussein, father of Abdullah, who died of lymphatic cancer
on February 7.
</P>

Abdullah and Shelton discussed issues of mutual concern, the

The U.S. has delivered military equipments worth 25 million
U.S. dollars this year to Jordan, which President Bill Clinton
regarded as a neo-ally.
</P>
<P>
The equipments include armored vehicles, anti-tank missiles,
night vision equipments, arms and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
Shelton is the second senior U.S. military official who has
visited Jordan in one week. Commander of the U.S. Central Command
Anthony Zinni visited the strategically located kingdom Monday.
</P>
<P>
The visits by senior U.S. military officers were seen as a
further U.S. move to show solidarity with Jordan after Abdullah
acceded to the throne on February 7.

CAIRO, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Minister of Economy
Youssef Boutros Ghali held talks here Saturday with Maltese
Foreign Minister George Vella on means of boosting bilateral trade
and economic ties.
</P>
<P>
Ghali and Vella were seeking ways that suit "historic and
cultural ties" between the two countries and the fact that Egypt
and Malta are Mediterranean states, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ghali expounded his country's current economic developments and
the good results of the economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Egypt started in 1991 the economic reforms to loosen control
over and privatize state-owned enterprises. Since then, the
country's gross domestic product has grown from 2 percent to more
than 5 percent, inflation fallen from 20 percent to under 5
percent and foreign currency reserves climbed to about 20 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that Egypt encourages direct foreign investments in the
country and offers incentives to investors, adding that there are
"good chances" for Maltese businessmen to invest in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Egypt attracted about 1.2 billion dollars of foreign
investments in 1998, occupying a leading place in the African
counties in this regard.

<HEADLINE> DRC Rebel Leader Hails Tanzania's Role in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The political leader of
the rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Ernest Wamba
dia Wamba, commended Saturday the role played by Tanzania in
bringing about peace and stability in the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Dar es Salaam, Wamba dia Wamba
said it was encouraging that Tanzania has always been a tool for
defense of freedom and justice.
</P>
<P>
He cited Tanzania's contributions during liberation struggles
in Zimbabwe, Namibia and Mozambique, as well as civil strifes in
Rwanda and DRC.
</P>
<P>
Wamba dia Wamba, who is the president of the Congolese Rally
for Democracy (RCD), stressed that his party will continue to
fight for democracy in DRC and urged south African countries to
support efforts to restore stability in the central African
country.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader said he had already held discussions with
Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa and former president Julius
Nyerere, a veteran statesman, on DRC crisis.
</P>
<P>
Wamba dia Wamba, who was born in Congo in 1942, has worked for
the University of Dar es Salaam as a history professor until he
devoted himself to the rebel movement against the government of
Laurent Kabila last August. He was also an activist opposing the
rule of late Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader who came to Tanzania earlier this week asked
Tanzania to, like Uganda and Rwanda, support him in fighting
against DRC President Laurent Kabila, but was snubbed.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has been neutral in the DRC conflict. The conflict,
which started as a civil war last August, has since dragged in
Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Chad, which are fighting on Kabila's
side, and Uganda and Rwanda in support of the rebels.

DAR ES SALAAM, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Regional
Commissioner of Tabora in north Tanzania, Steven Mashishanga, has
requested the central government to close a refugee camp to curb
ever increasing banditry incidents there.
</P>
<P>
Mashishanga made the request while Prime Minister Frederick

The regional commissioner said the police have apprehended a

refugees, according to reports reaching here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said that banditry in the camp has escalated after donors

Since the government is not helping the management of the camp,
he said, it would be better for the camp to be closed and let
refugees go back to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
According to the Regional Commissioner, the camp has 40,185
refugees from Burundi and 29 from Rwanda.

PARIS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The six-nation Contact Group for
former Yugoslavia decided Saturday evening to extend the Kosovo
talks in Rambouillet, southwest of Paris, until 15:00 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the Contact Group said in a statement
that "Rather substantial progress has been achieved on the road
toward an agreement," in particular in the framework of agreement
and on the political chapter of an agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We estimate that that justifies an ultimate effort for
arriving at the conclusion of the intermediary agreement and the
arrangements proposed for reaching an agreement on an
international military and civil presence in Kosovo for
implementing and guaranteeing the intermediary agreement," said
the foreign ministers of the United States, France, Britain,
Germany, Italy and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The intermediary agreement calls for the establishment of high
degree self-rule by ethnic Albanians in Kosovo under international
supervision.
</P>
<P>
But the Yugoslav side has rejected the dispatch of a NATO-led
international force to Kosovo to guarantee the implementation of
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group said that "Those who would be the cause of a
failure" of the prolonged talks would be held responsible for the
consequences.
</P>
<P>
"No effort has been spared by either the three international
mediators, or the member countries of the Contact Group for
arriving at an agreement," it said.
</P>
<P>
The talks were previously scheduled to expire at noon Saturday,
but continued until late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Both the Serbs and Kosovo Albanians have been subjected to
great pressure from the Western countries to accept a peace plan,
which includes establishing high degree self-rule for Kosovo to be
guaranteed by an international force led by NATO.
</P>
<P>
NATO has threatened to strike Serb forces in Kosovo if the
Rambouillet talks collapse.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns Annexation of Lebanese Village by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi Saturday condemned the recent
Israeli measures to annex Arnoun village in southern Lebanon to
Israel's occupation.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said that the Israeli move contradicts the false claims
by the Israeli regime to be ready to withdraw from south Lebanon,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Israel expanded its occupied zone in south Lebanon on
Wednesday night by annexing Arnoun village into the so-called
security zone which Israel established in 1985 to allegedly
protect its north from Lebanese guerrillas' attacks.
</P>
<P>
Such an expansionist move is in violation of international
regulations, Asefi said.
</P>
<P>
He voiced Iran's readiness to continue supporting the
struggles and resistance by the Lebanese government and people
against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also called on other countries and international
community to adopt necessary measures to strongly encounter the
Israeli move.

PARIS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said on Saturday evening that the Yugoslav side has
refused to make concession to allow an international force in
Kosovo to guarantee the implementation of a self-rule agreement.
</P>
<P>
"It is always the Yugoslav delegation which refuses to make
concessions or take indispensable decisions on a military presence
in the field in Kosovo," he said at a press conference held in
Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group has given Yugoslavia and Kosovo Albanians
three more days to accept its peace plan.

"We are expecting from the Yugoslavs that they accept the
autonomy of Kosovo and a military presence in the field," said
Vedrine.

NATO plans to send up to 30,000 troops to Kosovo on a peace
keeping mission in a three-year interim period.

<HEADLINE> S. African Divers in Lesotho for Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 20 (Xinhua) -- A team of 20 specialist
divers from South Africa Saturday arrived in Maseru, capital of
Lesotho, to search dams for weapons reported dumped after last
year's unrest, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The search follows the discovery of a machine gun in a dam near
the Makoanyane military base on the outskirts of Maseru by a
fisherman last week.
</P>
<P>
While fishing at the dam, the fisherman asked a young boy to
dive into the water after his fishing rod was snagged underwater.
The boy found the hook snagged by the weapon.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted the commander of the Southern African Development
Community task force in Lesotho, Colonel Hans Swart, as saying
that the exercise was necessary to ensure that illegal weapons,
which could be used to destabilize Lesotho, were not scattered
around the country.
</P>
<P>
Swart said more weapons could have been hidden or thrown into
dams in and around Maseru, therefore the search needed to be
carried out. The search would go on for about a week.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho was plunged into political turmoil last September when
opposition parties protested against the results of the general
election in May.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Says No Palestinian State, No Comprehensive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Egypt stressed Saturday that
a comprehensive peace will not be realized in the Middle East
without an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
"Peace will not be complete (in the Middle East) without a
Palestinian state," Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told
reporters after a meeting between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived here from Rome Friday to discuss with Mubarak
the latest developments in the Mideast peace process. He wrapped
up the brief visit Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian issue must be dealt with as something which
"represents the right of self-determination of the Palestinian
people," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the conflict between Arab countries and Israel
"will remain open" if the Palestinian people do not have their own
state as the Palestinian question has been the core of the
conflict over the past half century.
</P>
<P>
May 4, 1999, is "an undisputed date" for the Palestinians to
declare an independent state, the Egyptian official stressed.
</P>
<P>
Under peace agreements signed between the Palestinians and
Israel, a permanent peace agreement will be signed by the
date. And Arafat has repeatedly announced that he will declare a
Palestinian state that day regardless of the results of the
talks.
</P>
<P>
The peace process on the Palestinian-Israeli track has been
stalled since December due to Israel's failure to carry out the
Wye accord signed last October.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, Israel should have pulled out its troops from
another 13 percent of the West Bank in three phases by the end of
January. But it shelved the accord after only implementing the
first phase of withdrawal in early December.
</P>
<P>
The question of declaring a Palestinian state "has remained
constantly under discussion" among the Egyptian, Palestinian,
European and American diplomatic circles, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
"But we all agree on the right of Palestinians to declare their
state and that a state actually means a comprehensive settlement
in the Middle East with regard to the Arab-Israeli conflict," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Israel has staunchly expressed opposition to Palestinians'
statehood declaration, threatening to take tough actions against
the possible move, including annexation of parts of the West
Bank.

ANKARA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit Saturday appealed to all the Kurdish separatists to
surrender in exchange for lenient punishment.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit made the call after leader of the Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK) Abdullah Ocalan was arrested in Kenya and brought back to
Turkey early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 a guerrilla war for an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey, which has
claimed over 37,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said that he had received assurances from all the
parties in parliament that they will back a "repentance law" after
general elections on April 18.
</P>
<P>
The proposal calls for leniency to those who lay down their
arms and give inside information.
</P>
<P>
"Youths hiding in mountains and in caves should come and find
refuge with the justice system," Ecevit said.
</P>
<P>
"Rescue yourselves from the hands of those who exploited you
and threw you into the fire," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit pointed out that Ocalan, who could face the death
penalty, will not benefit from the law as he is the head of an
organization which has caused great grief to Turkey for 15 years.

Iran expects the Iraqi government to adopt every necessary

In last April and June, two prominent Shiite theologians were

LAGOS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- A contingent of 428 Malian
troops arrived at Lungi airport in capital Freetown of Sierra
Leone Saturday to reinforce the West African peace-keeping force
in that country, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted ECOMOG Chief of Staff Brig. Gen. Abubakar
Ahmadu as saying "we are happy that you have come to Sierra Leone
as our main constraints have been fighting men and logistics."
</P>
<P>
Airlifting of armored vehicles and other equipment from Mali
capital Bamako to Freetown started Friday and was finished
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG has about 15,000 troops in Sierra Leone with Nigeria
providing the bulk of the force which reinstated the
democratically-elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah almost a year
after he was toppled by the country's army.
</P>
<P>
The rebel Revolutionary United Front troops and renegade
soldiers last month launched attacks on Freetown and took some
parts of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian-led ECOMOG troops drove the rebels from Freetown
but they remain active in some hilly areas around the capital.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Kabbah agreed on negotiations with the
rebels while Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar
and two presidential candidates have announced that Nigeria would
pull out its troops from Sierra Leone before the hand-over date of
May 29 by the current military government.

CAIRO, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim
Hoss arrived here Saturday for talks with Egyptian officials on
regional issues and bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
This is Hoss' first official visit to Egypt since assuming
power last December.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is to hold talks with Hoss
Sunday morning, sources of Egypt's press center said.
</P>
<P>
The talks are expected to center on the latest developments in
the Mideast situation, Israel's occupation of south Lebanon and
bilateral relations, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with a
claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israel offered last year to pull back troops from Lebanon if
Beirut can guarantee the security of its north.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon rejected the offer, enforcing an unconditional
withdrawal according to the U.N. resolution 425 adopted in 1982
after Israel's invasion of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal El-Ganzouri will also meet with
Hoss Sunday morning to discuss means of enhancing economic
cooperation and increasing bilateral trade under a free trade zone
agreement, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The annual bilateral trade volume is estimated at 75 million
U.S. dollars, including 60 million dollars worth of Egyptian
exports.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese investments in Egypt stand at 3 billion Egypt pounds
(882 million dollars), covering 139 projects.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Helps Turkey in Capture of Ocalan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States worked
for four months to help Turkey arrest Abdullah Ocalan, the leader
of Kurdistan Workers Party, U.S. officials acknowledged on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The officials confirmed the gist of reports carried by the Los
Angeles Times and the New York Times, which said American
diplomatic pressure backed by intelligence-gathering helped to put
Ocalan in flight from a safe haven in Syria, to persuade nation
after nation to refuse him sanctuary, and to drive him into an
increasingly desperate search for a city of refuge.
</P>
<P>
"We've been engaged diplomatically for months to bring him
to justice," one of the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, who has lived in exile since 1980, was first expelled
by Syria in November, then bounced from country to country in
search of a safe haven until he took refugee in the Greek
embassy in Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Turkish commandos captured Ocalan on Monday as he was
supposedly being driven to the Nairobi airport for a flight to
Amsterdam. He is now being held for interrogation and trial on a
Turkish island.
</P>
<P>
Members of a U.S. team of intelligence and law enforcement
officers, in Nairobi investigating the bombing of the U.S.
embassy there last August, quickly discovered that Ocalan had
arrived there, reports said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> G7 Finance Ministers Meeting Approving Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Calling on Europe to boost
domestic-led growth, G7 finance ministers on Saturday approved
plans for closer coordination of markets by launching a Financial
Stability Forum to help avert future global crises.
</P>
<P>
"We want to use this Forum to improve the cooperation between
national and international authorities and relevant international
bodies to promote international financial stability," said United
States Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin.
</P>
<P>
Meeting twice a year from Spring 1999, the Forum will include
finance ministries and central banks of the G7 states, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the Bank for
International Settlements (BIS), the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development and banking, insurance and stock
market control agencies.
</P>
<P>
Based in Basle, Switzerland, the Forum will have some 35
members and be headed by Andrew Crocker, director of the
Basle-based BIS, for a term of three years. It reports to G7
ministers and central bank governors. The Forum may be expanded to
include a small number of non-G7 nations in the future, ministers
said.
</P>
<P>
In a nutshell, the Forum serves as an early-warning system and
gives more muscle to existing arrangements for supervision and
surveillance of the international finance system. It will assess
dangers to the global financial system and oversee actions to
address them, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the Forum's slimline approach, the report said it was
to coordinate existing capacities - not create any sort of new
world economic body.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting of G7 finance ministers and central bankers
at Koengiswinter, near Bonn, ended with a communique urging
members of the wealthy industrial states to push domestic-based
growth which would support struggling emerging markets by taking
in more exports.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also discussed ways to relieve debt burdens of the
poorest developing nations.
</P>
<P>
The G7 states are: Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Support for His School Initiatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
urged Congress on Saturday to embrace and advance federal
initiatives in public education that he said have roots in states
and classrooms across the country.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio address, Clinton said state efforts to
improve education must be underpinned by commonsense federal
programs.
</P>
<P>
"All across our nation, we're seeing a grass-roots revolution
in education -- a revolution in accountability and rising
expectations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This year, we have a rare opportunity to use our new
prosperity to help this revolution spread to every single school
district, every classroom, every child," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The trick is helping more communities to put these proven
solutions to work in their own public schools," the president
said. "I believe the national government has an obligation to help
them do that."
</P>
<P>
Clinton's proposals include building or modernizing 6,000
classrooms, hiring 100,000 teachers, reducing class size in the
early grades, starting more after-school programs, connecting all
classrooms and libraries to the Internet, stopping social
promotion and insisting on effective discipline.
