<HEADLINE> Egypt Ready to Cooperate with Barak: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Tuesday expressed
willingness to cooperate with Israel's prime minister-elect Ehud
Barak in salvaging the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"In light of Cairo's expectations of (the victory of) Barak (in
the Israeli elections)," Egypt "is ready to" cooperate with him in
advancing the peace process, said Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Moussa was commenting on the results of the Israeli elections
held on Monday, during which Barak, leader of the Labor Party,
defeated incumbent Prime Minister and leader of the Likud
Group Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"Barak can lean on us in Egypt," Moussa said, expressing hope
that the peace talks on the Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese
tracks will all be revived.
</P>
<P>
"We shall closely follow up the developments, and are willing
to extend a hand of help to Barak, and cooperate with him, as long
as he makes peace his target and salvaging of the peace process
his policy," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt "is also willing to work for" improving the general
atmosphere in the Mideast region, which "has been largely poisoned
over the past three years," he added.
</P>
<P>
The intransigent policy adopted by Netanyahu after he came to
power in 1996 intensified the Arab countries' mistrust in him. The
Arabs later decided to freeze the normalization process of their
relations with Israel, which started during the reign of Israel's
former Labor government.

<HEADLINE> GM Potato Study Was "Flawed", UK Scientists Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The study of researcher Dr Arpad
Pusztai which claimed genetically modified (GM) potatoes were
toxic to rats was "flawed", a panel of leading British scientists
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Dr Pusztai's controversial research
triggered a row in Britain over the safety of GM foods after 20
scientists held a press conference in February to declare their
support for his study.
</P>
<P>
However, the panel of six toxicologists, appointed by Britain's
influential Royal Society, now dismissed the research as
"irrelevant and inconclusive".
</P>
<P>
The work undertaken by Dr Pusztai when he worked in Rowett
Research Institute, Scotland, was flawed in many "aspects of
design, execution and analysis," the panel said.
</P>
<P>
"We found no convincing evidence of adverse affects from GM
potatoes," the scientists said in a report.
</P>
<P>
"Where the data seemed to show slight differences between rats
fed predominantly on GM and on non-GM potatoes, the differences
were uninterpretable because of the technical limitations of the
experiments and the incorrect use of statistical tests," they
added.
</P>
<P>
Pusztai lost his job shortly after alleging in a television
interview last Summer that rats fed on GM potatoes suffered
stunted growth, damaged organs and impaired immune systems.
</P>
<P>
The institute said he had ignored scientific protocol by going
public with his claims before the research had been peer reviewed
and published in a recognized scientific journal.
</P>
<P>
In its report, the panel of the Royal Society also concluded
that "The whole episode underlines how important it is that
research scientists should expose new research results to others
able to offer informed criticism before releasing them into the
public arena."

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Newspaper: NATO Bombing "Morally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A leading Tanzanian newspaper
said Tuesday that NATO's bombing-only strategy on Yugoslavia is
"morally defective and will not work."
</P>
<P>
The official Daily News said in an article that such a strategy
is not only morally defective, but also will not work because
Yugoslavia will see popular and diplomatic support for war erode
with each bombing error."
</P>
<P>
"If NATO sticks to this bombing-only strategy for another three
or four weeks, while shunning all preparations for a ground attack
to retake Kosovo, Milosevic will win and public support for the
war will collapse," it said.
</P>
<P>
"That's the kind of wishful thinking - 'Milosevic just needs a
few nights of bombing to give him an excuse to withdraw' - that
got NATO into this war without any plan in the first place," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The article said NATO's political deadline for getting serious
about this war has become very pressing if the Kosovo refugees are
to go back to their homeland with food and rudimentary shelter
before the snow flies.
</P>
<P>
"In practice, NATO can only jump where the United States wants
it to go, so that means the decision first have to be taken in
Washington," it noted.
</P>
<P>
The article doubted about the Unites States' resolution because
"there is an old adage that any foreign leader who can
convincingly threaten to kill 20 American troops (can) effectively
controls U.S. foreign policy."
</P>
<P>
"The latest and most grotesque case of bombing, the bombing of
the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, is the direct and inevitable
consequence of the coward's strategy that NATO has adopted," it
said.
</P>
<P>
"The reason for this strategy is that while it kills lots of
other people, most of whom are in no sense NATO's enemies, it
doesn't cost any American lives," the article concluded.

<HEADLINE> Feature: "Dear Yitzhak, It Will Be Good" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Amalia Juna and her daughter
Rinat gently laid two small gravels on the marble gravestone of
late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, then stood silently for a few
minutes, with tears in their eyes.
</P>
<P>
Since Rabin was assassinated in 1995, they came here almost
every month to pay tribute to the brave peace fighter. Today,
they found more reasons to do so.
</P>
<P>
"I came today because Mr. Ehud Barak won the prime minister
elections. This means the legacy of Mr. Rabin will continue," said
the mother. "We want peace, peace, just peace," she added.
</P>
<P>
Barak, the Labor Party leader, defeated incumbent Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by a sliding majority in the general
elections Monday. He is a protege of Rabin, who pioneered the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Barak laid a wreath before Rabin's tomb,
pledging to commit himself to the legacy of his mentor and revive
the peace process, which was stalled under the Netanyahu's
administration.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, people came one after another to visit the Rabin
tomb, which lies in the Mount Herzl of western Jerusalem, laying
flowers, lighting candles or putting gravels on the gravestone,
an unique way for Israelis to express memorial of the dead.
</P>
<P>
"I believe today is a special day for Rabin," said Elisheva, a
17-year-old high school student who came here after
classes. "Barak has the same goal with Rabin, which is to achieve
peace with the Arabs," she said.
</P>
<P>
After lighting a candle before the tomb, she stood
motionlessly, looking down at a wreath, which is tied with a note
that reads, "for the first time since you were murdered, we could
stand here, raising our heads up."
</P>
<P>
Beside the wreath is a bouquet of flowers which also has a
note saying, "Dear Yitzhak, it will be good."
</P>
<P>
"Peace is important for us," Elisheva said, "I believe Barak
will be a good prime minister and I hope he will do everything he
can to push forward the peace process."
</P>
<P>
In the twilight, a group of elementary school students
accompanied by their parents and teachers arrived. Standing in a
rank before the tomb, 10 students began to read out the profile
of Rabin one by one, their parents, teachers and classmates
listening carefully.
</P>
<P>
Then, a song was wafted in the breeze, "... if we want peace,
don't whisper, we should shout for it. Don't tell us that peace
will come someday, give us now. Sing, sing a song of peace, don't
whisper it." This song, called "the song of peace," was Rabin's
favorite and he sang it along with hundreds of thousands of his
supporters just moments before he was killed by an
ultra-nationalist.
</P>
<P>
"Peace had always been Rabin's wish, and it is also the wish
of most Israelis, " said Aviela, one of the teachers.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Claim Memory Chip Breakthrough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A team of British and Japanese
scientists have announced a breakthrough in semiconductor memory
technology, which they claimed will revolutionize the industry,
Financial Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new chip was developed at a laboratory in Britain's
Cambridge University which is funded by the Japanese electronics
group Hitachi, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Made up of a single, smaller transistor, the new memory chip
stores more information, runs on smaller batteries and is believed
to cost no more to produce than existing devices.
</P>
<P>
The advance makes possible the fabrication of a memory chip the
size of a thumbnail capable of storing all the sounds and images
of a full-length feature film, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
The new chip is so powerful that it may replace present day
storage devices such as computer hard disc drives and could be
used in lighter, more powerful laptop computers.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, it can retain its memory for up to 10 years when
the power is switched off.
</P>
<P>
The new chip will be commercially available in 2005, according
to Financial Times.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says Willing to Help Barak Pursue Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Tuesday said he would like to help Ehud Barak, Israel's newly
elected prime minister, pursue land-for-peace accord with the
Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"I think the road map is out there," Clinton said, referring
to last year's Wye agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians. "And we'll do what we've always done. And I've
been working at this for six years, and I'm looking forward to
continuing."
</P>
<P>
He spoke during a picture-taking session in the Oval Office
with Jordan's King Abdullah, son of the late King Hussein, who
helped enginer success at Wye River.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he would wait for Barak to form his government
before turning to the revival of the peace process in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said if Barak is willing to revive the peace process,
he and Abdullah would certainly be willing to do so. "We're hopeful
that we'll have a chance to do so," he added
</P>
<P>
Clinton telephoned Barak and outgoing Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on Monday after the outcome of the elections was
clear, and issued a statement through the White House, hoping
the new Israeli leader to pursue "a just, lasting and
comprehensive peace."
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration had taken an apparent neutral
position throughout the Israeli campaign. But there was no doubt
that U.S. policy-makers preferred Barak, who takes a softer line
toward the Arabs and whose party has already signaled it would
accept a Palestinian state.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Firmly Supports China's Entry into WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac said
on Tuesday that France firmly supports China's efforts to enter
the World Trade Organization (WTO) and he hoped that China can
enter the WTO before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
released by the Elysee presidential palace, Chirac said that
France, as well as Germany, have taken note of the efforts already
made by China to create necessary conditions for its admission by
WTO.
</P>
<P>
"France and Germany encourage China to contribute to a rapid
completion of the on-going talks, in order to let it participate
in the forthcoming cycle of multilateral trade talks," said Chirac
and Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders said that France and Germany are ready to
maneuver within the European Union (EU) in favor of Chinese entry
into the WTO, so that China can continue to support constructive
solutions to the international trade problems and help better
balance the interests of all countries.
</P>
<P>
"France and Germany count for that on the efforts made by China
to adapt its trade system to the rules of the WTO and to the
principles of a trade order founded on the market," they said.
</P>
<P>
They said that China is one of the most important trade
partners of the European Union, therefore the degree of its
integration into the global trade is already "well advanced."
</P>
<P>
"A rapid adhesion of China to WTO, with all the rights and
duties which it implies within the international trade body, is in
the interests of our two countries, the EU, and other member
countries of the WTO, as well as those of China itself," they
said.

WASHINGTON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
welcomed King Abdullah of Jordan on Tuesday at the White House and
said the United States would help the kingdom and its troubled
economy.

</P>
<P>
"The United States has already done about all we can on that.
We've done quite a bit," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's economic condition was at least as much a topic on
the king's visit as the Arab-Israeli dispute.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is urging Japan, Germany, France and other creditor
nations to cancel or postpone payment of Jordan's debts to help
the new king cope with his faltering economy, which is growing
at 1 percent or less a year under a foreign debt burden of 6.3
billion U.S. dollar.

OTTAWA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Canada's manufacturers' shipments

And British Prime Minister Tony Blair has said NATO should
openly keep the option of a ground war, an indication supported by

<HEADLINE> Humanitarian Situation in Angola "Very Serious": </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Minister of Assistance and
Social Reintegration Albino Malungo said here Tuesday that the
humanitarian situation in his country is "very serious" because
most of the war refugees are facing severe food shortage.
</P>
<P>
Malungo told visiting Portuguese State Secretary of Foreign
Affairs and Cooperation Luis Amado that the number of the Angolan
refugees has soared up to 1.7 million, some one-tenth of the
country's population, since the civil war renewed last December.
</P>
<P>
However, "only 49 percent of the refugees can get the
international relief so far," Malungo said, adding that the major
international relief organ, the United Nations World Food Program,
is only able to help 800,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. organ has tried to supply northern province of Malanje
with food aid by airlifting as often as possible, but consistent
shelling by the rebel National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) has made delivery difficult.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian situation in the rest of Angola continues to
deteriorate as the UNITA forces put increasing pressure on the
government's troops.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan minister noted that "70 percent of the Angolan
people are living in absolute poverty." But the government has
only 25 million U.S. dollars for humanitarian assistance, far from
enough to deal with the current critical situation.
</P>
<P>
He said that some three million people in Malanje and the
central provinces of Huambo and Bie receive no relief and they are
just struggling to live on.
</P>
<P>
The rebel movement UNITA and the Angolan government have been
at war since 1975 when the country won independence from Portugal.

<HEADLINE> 9 Million U.S. Children Face Multiple Family Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- About 9.2 million children are
facing numerous family problems in the United States, according to
a survey released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 Kids Count survey said about one in seven American
children face at least four out of six risk factors affecting
their chance for success.
</P>
<P>
The risk factors include growing up in a single-parent
household, with parents who lack a high school education or who do
not have full-time jobs, living in poverty, relying on welfare and
lacking health insurance.
</P>
<P>
Many high-risk children come from poor families and live in
inner-city or rural neighborhoods cut off from good job
opportunities, quality schools and strong community support, said
Douglas W. Nelson, president of the Annie E. Casey Foundation that
sponsors the survey.
</P>
<P>
Children growing up with multiple family risk factors are more
likely to fail than the average American child.
</P>
<P>
Nelson said a child from a family with four risk factors is 26
times more likely to drop out of school than a child from a
no-risk family while a girl in a four-risk category is 160 times
more likely to end up a teen mother than her no-risk female
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
The survey said black and Hispanic children are more likely
than white children to grow up in families with multiple risks.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 30 percent of all black children and 25 percent of
Hispanic children are in the high-risk category, compared with 6
percent of white children, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
About one in four high-risk children live in a rural area and
one in three live in poor, urban neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
The Kids Count survey is released annually by the Casey
Foundation, a children's advocacy group based in Baltimore.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Ethiopian PM Discuss Eritrean-Ethiopian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said on Tuesday that the talks between Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi dwelt on the
Eritrean-Ethiopian border conflicts and initiatives to end it.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters after the talks that Mubarak listened to
the Ethiopian point of view on its conflicts with Eritrea after he
listened to the Eritrean views when he met with President Issaias
Afworki Monday.
</P>
<P>
On the efforts to contain the row between the two Horn of
African countries, Moussa said this issue was pondered during the
talks, affirming that the goal is to halt the fighting within an
African framework.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt supports such a framework and we are trying to get the
consent of the two belligerent parties on it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia was content pertaining to the African initiative,
which is still under consideration, and Afworki has his stand on
it, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
"All what we are doing is persuading the two parties to accept
the African initiative," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the African initiative, Moussa said that it includes border
delineation between Ethiopia and Eritrea, pullback of troops and
halt to the fighting and there are many issues left for
negotiations between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
Zenawi arrived in Cairo earlier in the day. He will resume
talks with Mubarak on Wednesday, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea and Ethiopia have been waging sporadic wars since last
May for several border areas. The Organization of African Unity
and some countries have been trying to persuade the two parties to
solve their disputes through peaceful means. But no tangible
results have been achieved.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Although some opposition parties in
Mozambique wished to put off the country's general elections to
next May, the ruling Mozambique Liberation Front (Frelimo), and
the largest opposition, the Mozambique National Resistance
(Renamo), have agreed that the presidential and parliamentary
elections be held within this year.
</P>
<P>
Afonso Dhlakama, chairman of Renamo, said here Monday that he
agreed on holding elections before December when the rainy season
starts, the Mozambique News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Virginia Matabele, a senior Frelimo official in
 parliament, told a press conference at the headquarters of the
ruling party that the two major events facing Frelimo this year
are elections and revision on the constitution.
</P>
<P>
However, he insisted that the elections scheduled for October
this year cannot be postponed, for the tenure of both the
president and members of parliament will expire before the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
President Joaquim Chissano told the press in mid-April that he
didn't want the election date postponed.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A successful business woman, an
environmental journalist and the All-China Women's Federation are
among this year's 17 winners of the United Nations Environment
Program (UNEP) Global 500 Award, UNEP announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding contributions to the protection of the
environment of these individuals and organizations from 12
countries will be officially recognized on June 5 at a special
award ceremony in Tokyo, UNEP said.
</P>
<P>
The event, hosted by UNEP and Japan, is part of the World
Environment Day celebrations.
</P>
<P>
"UNEP is indeed very proud to recognize the environmental
achievements of this year's winners," said UNEP Executive
Director, Klaus Toepfer.
</P>
<P>
"These often `silent heroes' have demonstrated in the most
concrete way that we have the knowledge, the power and the
technology to solve many of our environmental problems. More
importantly, they have set an example for many of us to follow,"
added Toepfer.
</P>
<P>
The laureates who will receive their awards from UNEP Executive
Director include Bebe Arcifa Khan-Ajodha, a teacher from Trinidad
and Tobago, who succeeded in making environmental education a
national priority; the 120- million strong All-China Women's
Federation for their country- wide afforestation efforts; Vilmar
Berna, an environmental journalist from Brazil, who transforms
his words into action.
</P>
<P>
The list of winners also includes four Global 500 laureates in
the youth category who have demonstrated that you are never too
young to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
Since the inception of the Global 500 Roll of Honour in 1987,
some 691 individuals and organizations, in both the youth and
adult categories, have been honored with this award.
</P>
<P>
To forge Global links and to implement ideas which can
contribute to a more sustainable future, a network of all Global
500 laureates has been formed, said UNEP, adding that it also
looks to the world community to identify and nominate
environmental advocates, so they too can be recognized for their
efforts.

<HEADLINE> Shas Party Leader Quits Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 18 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to find a place in
the new government for his party, Aryeh Deri, leader of Israel's
powerful religious Shas Party, Tuesday announced that he quitted
the Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Jerusalem, Deri said that he will not
lead the negotiations with the left-wing "One Israel" on forming a
coalition government as well.
</P>
<P>
But Deri said that he would remain as the leader of the party.
</P>
<P>
Deri made the decision after his Shas party won 17 seats in
the 120-member Knesset in Monday's general elections, an amazing
growth from 10 seats in the last Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Ehud Barak, leader of the "One Israel" coalition, won a landslide
victory over the incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in
Monday's elections.
</P>
<P>
Barak has said that he would not conduct coalition negotiations
with Deri, since the Shas leader was convicted of bribery and
fraud charges and sentenced to four years in jail just before the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Following the elections, Barak has 45 days to form a coalition
and submit it to the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Barak has said that he wanted to form a broad-based coalition,
which may include religious or right-wing parties.

MOSCOW, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Tuesday that it hopes
the dangerous impasse in the Middle East peace process will be
finally overcome with Ehud Barak elected Monday as the new Israeli
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The elections are "an important event in the political life of
Israel and of the entire region," the Russian Foreign Ministry

<P>
Russia as a co-sponsor in the peace process "believes that the
future cabinet of ministers, with the help of the new Knesset,

reactivate the talks between Israel and its Arab neighbors," the
statement said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe To Issue Gender Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean organizations and
institutions will soon be compelled to formulate gender policies
once the national gender policy is drawn up, minister of state
responsible for gender issues Oppah Muchinguri said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening a Norwegian People's Aid gender workshop in
Harare, the minister said that consultations on the input to the
policy with women from all the provinces were about to be
completed.
</P>
<P>
"Once the policy is in place, all organizations and
institutions will be compelled to formulate gender policies that
will address their communities' needs," she said.
</P>
<P>
The draft of the gender policy document would be presented to
President Robert Mugabe's cabinet in August for its consideration.
</P>
<P>
Muchinguri said the gender policy would resolve, among other
things, cultural inhibitions that made women not realize their
rights.
</P>
<P>
She said once the policy was in place, courses would be
introduced in schools and colleges aimed at enforcing gender
development programs.
</P>
<P>
The concept of gender policy was adopted at the 4th World
Conference on Women held in Beijing, China in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe did not have a gender policy since the Beijing
Declaration despite government's pledge at different fora that it
was going to introduce one.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Expects Little from Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's Prime Minister Salim Hoss
Tuesday held out little hope that the election of Ehud Barak as
Israel's new prime minister would improve the chances of an
imminent regional peace or of an Israeli withdrawal from his
country.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the peace process be revived as soon as possible, but
not very optimistic about that despite the election of Barak as
Israel's new prime minister," Hoss said in a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Labor Party leader Barak won a landslide victory in the
country's election on Monday, defeating Likud leader Benjamin
Netanyahu, whom Arab countries have blamed for the stalemate of
peace process since he came to power in June, 1996.
</P>
<P>
"There is no difference between one Israeli candidate or
another. We should remember that most of Israeli wars against
Arabs were led by Labor party leaders," Hoss added.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that it was a Labor-led government that launched
the April aggression on Lebanon three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Led by the government of the then-prime Minister Shimon Peres,
Israeli army launched a 16-day assault on Lebanon to avenge
Hezbollah's cross-border Katyusha attacks on northern Israel,
killing nearly 200 Lebanese, mostly civilians.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever the Israeli prime minister is, we only stick to our
principle in the peace process," Hoss said, with a reference to
the United Nations' Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, adopted by the U.N. 20 years ago following the
Israeli first invasion on Lebanon, calls for immediate pullout by
Israeli troops from Lebanon without any conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu government has offered to withdraw its troops on
the condition that Beirut agrees with a negotiated security
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its strong neighbor Syria, flatly rejected the
offer and demanded the Jewish state to leave the country as the
resolution stipulates.
</P>
<P>
With its 35,000 troops stationed in Lebanon as peacekeepers,
Syria has been seeking a full Israeli withdrawal, which also
covers the pullback from its Golan Heights captured by Israel in
the 1967 Middle East war.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Nine Israelis were wounded Tuesday
morning during Lebanese Hezbollah's attacks on Israel's northern
area, the official National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted a statement issued by the militia group as
saying that Hezbollah unleashed over 60 Katyusha rockets onto
Israel's northern area of Galilee, injuring at least nine
Israeli residents and damaging two houses.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli radio later confirmed the casualties, the agency
added.
</P>
<P>
The attack was seen as a retaliation for the killing of two
Lebanese young men by Israeli bombardment on a village in south
Lebanon Monday night, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The attack raised to six the number of Lebanese civilians
killed in south Lebanon since the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in 1985 with
the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting
to oust Israeli forces and its ally South Lebanon Army out
of the country.
</P>
<P>
The latest flare-up came when Israeli Labor Party leader Ehud
Barak swept to a landslide victory in the country's general
elections on Monday, defeating the hardline incumbent Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
After winning the election, Barak told his supporters that
he would withdraw Israeli troops out of Lebanon within one
year.

<HEADLINE> African Regional Meeting on Risk Reduction Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A four-day conference on Disaster
Reduction for Africa in the 21st century opened here Tuesday, with
representatives from 30 African countries and 12 international
organizations and NGOs to discuss socio-economic, scientific,
technical and development aspects of disaster reduction.
</P>
<P>
As part of concluding events of the International
Disaster-reduction Decade, the meeting will provide an opportunity
to assess the accomplishments of disaster reduction in Africa in
the past nine years and chart the direction for sustained disaster
prevention in the future.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of Klaus Topfer, Executive Director of the
United Nations Environment program (UNEP), Executive Secretary of
the Ozone Secretariat Madhava Sarma said that Africa cannot remain
immune to the impacts of global climate change.
</P>
<P>
Desertification is more likely to become irreversible if the
environment becomes drier and the soil is further degraded through
erosion, he said, adding that Africa was unprepared for disasters
like El Nino and unable to overcome the consequences or meet the
costs of rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
Sarma said that UNEP and Office of Coordination for
Humanitarian Affairs have sought to address these problems by
bringing together available international mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan State Minister Amukowa Anangwe said at the opening
ceremony that Africa cannot afford natural disasters because they
tend to exacerbate poverty conditions.
</P>
<P>
"A single natural disaster in an African country may reverse
fundamentally the gains made on the development front, " Anangwe
said.
</P>
<P>
Anangwe argues that emphasis should be put on disaster
prevention and sustainable development, effective early warning
systems, political and public policy commitment, shared knowledge
and technology transfer.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the regional meeting is part of closing events of
the Decade,
</P>
<P>
Anangwe said he supported the creation within the United Nations
system of a mechanism to deal with disasters beyond this Decade.
</P>
<P>
Director of the IDNDR Secretariat Philippe Boulle said that the
regional meeting will consider the issues conducive to disaster
prevention and risk management in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), Edward G.
Howard- Clinton proposed the establishment of a disaster
coordination Center for Africa in order to respond to the need for
disaster reduction and its management in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Disaster management has been a priority concern of the OAU, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The meeting from May 18 through 21 has been organized by the
International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction Secretariat
(IDNDR, 1990-2000), together with the UNEP under the sponsorship
of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA).

<HEADLINE> Salim Calls for Speedy Hearing of Treason Case in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim appealed
Tuesday to the Zanzibar judiciary to speed up the hearing of the
treason case facing 17 opposition Civic United Front (CUF)
members.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Zanzibar, Salim said there is
need for the judiciary to hear the case which started in late 1997
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to make any interference with this case but I
appeal to the judiciary to speed up the proceedings to ensure
justice is done...," he said.
</P>
<P>
Salim, who is attending the Pan-African Women's Conference,
said the judiciary authority should know that the delay of justice
means the denial of justice, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The accused persons are charged with plotting to overthrow the
isles government led by President Salmin Amour. The regional court
has completed preliminary inquiries and has handed over the case
to the High Court, but it it not known when further hearing of the
case will start.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief also rejected claims that he had made no efforts
to end the political impasse which had last nearly four years in
Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
He said he has kept regular contact with the Commonwealth
Secretary General Chief Emeka Anyaoku and his special envoy Moses
Anafu on the development of the political situation in Zanzibar,
and often talked to Zanzibar government officials and CUF leaders
encouraging both sides to end the political impasse through
peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
"In my capacity as the OAU Secretary General and a Zanzibari
and a citizen of Tanzania, I made frantic efforts to solve the
crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar's Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), under Salmin Amour who
was seeking a second term as president of the isles, claimed a
narrow victory over the CUF in the 1995 elections, but CUF
questioned the result.
</P>
<P>
Amour has refused to hold another ballot, saying his mandate
will extend until the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The dispute led to a wave of conflicts, including CUF's
boycotting of parliament sessions and the arrest of 17 CUF members
on treason charges. Following that, international community has
made great efforts to make the two parties reconcile.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the two parties announced in Dar es Salaam
that they will sign an agreement next month to resolve the
political impasse as reform measures will be taken in Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar, comprising Unguja and Pemba, as well as a number of
smaller islands, joined Tanganyika in 1964 to form the United
Republic of Tanzania.

Tuesday killed at least two people and wounded another 17 in the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as NATO bombing entered the 55th
day.
</P>
<P>
In the attacks launched against the town of Bor, NATO bombs
killed a kid and wounded five others while the attacks in Valjevo
killed a woman and injured 12 people.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, NATO warplanes dropped 53 missiles and dozens of
bombs in a dozen cities and towns including Gnjilane, Vranje,
Cacak, Kraljevo, Leskovac, Smeldero, Velika Plana, Vladicin Han,
Valjevo, Sabac, Batajnica, Sjenica and Uzice.
</P>
<P>
Though no explosions were heard in downtown Belgrade ever since
the Chinese embassy was bombed by NATO on May 7 and 8, detonations
were heard around the capital city's two airports of Sucin and
Batajnica on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav army opened fierce anti-aircraft fires to fend off
overflying NATO warplanes.
</P>
<P>
NATO continued its attack on the highway between Belgrade and
Nis, the third largest city in the federal republic, and damaged
the two-lane highway near the town of Velika Plana. Traffic was
temporarily closed down.
</P>
<P>
After a 22-hour interval, NATO resumed heavy bombing against
the Serbian province of Kosovo, where more than 40 rockets were
fired, especially around the southwestern town of Prizren and
surrounding villages.
</P>
<P>
NATO bombing may halt again within the next three or four days
in Kosovo as a United Nations fact-finding group plans to tour the
province later this week.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. group is to stay in Kosovo for two and a half days to
gather information about the current situation of refugees and
displaced people within Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Kukan Starts Work to Broaden U.N. Role in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. special envoy for the
Balkans said here Tuesday that he is doing "the very first step"
work to broaden the U.N. role in the process of seeking a
political solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Eduard Kukan, Slovakia's foreign minister who is one of the two
U.N. special envoys for the Balkans, told a press conference that
he is contacting relevant parties to see what way can the United
Nations make its engagement in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Kukan, together with former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt,
was appointed on May 7 by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan the
U.S. special envoy for the Balkans to render assistance to the
U.N. chief in his efforts to find a diplomatic settlement.
</P>
<P>
Kukan, who began a two-day visit to the U.N. headquarters in
New York, is meeting with representatives of the 15 Security
Council members, including Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent
representative to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"From the discussions so far, I can only say that there is
definitely interest and support for the inclusion of the United
Nations in the process of solutions of the crisis in the Balkans,
in Yugoslavia," said the special envoy.
</P>
<P>
"The timing of that inclusion is different in all the cases,"
he said, "That is to be negotiated in order to decide what the
right timing and what the way of engagement of the United Nations
is to be in order to play (a) constructive role to bring positive
contribution to the process of solution'" he said.
</P>
<P>
Kukan is scheduled to travel to Washington to meet with U.S.
Secretary of State Mandeleine Albright on Wednesday and to meet
with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov in Moscow on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Very deep coordination is needed at this time," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Russian involvement in the peace process, he said that
"It's very important to keep Russia in" and "to coordinate with
Russia." However, he said that he has no plan to visit Belgrade at
the moment.

<HEADLINE> China's Market for Elderly Shows Great Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The aging of Chinese society means
that the consumer market aimed at senior citizens will be very
promising in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
According to Xiong Bijun, a scholar on the aging issue, said
that the market potential for the aged depends on the government's
expenditure on social security benefits for the elderly, the
population of those aged consumers and, naturally, their income.
</P>
<P>
The China National Aging Society reveals that there are 120
million people above the age of 60 in the country, the world
largest aged population, and that number is growing by 3.2 percent
annually. It is expected to reach 130 million by the end of the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The society calculated that senior citizens in China could
spend at least 300 billion yuan (about 36 billion US dollars) each
year on consumer goods and various services.
</P>
<P>
Xiong, from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that
the Chinese government's expenditure on social security for the
elderly is increasing rapidly. Last year, pension spending on
retirees was approaching 200 billion yuan, and the figure is
expected to increase by 20 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
"With the improvement of the welfare system, the senior
citizens' income will keep on rising," said Xiong.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that the supply of commodities and
services for the elderly can not meet the increasing demand.
</P>
<P>
Gu Jiantang, a researcher with the Population Institute of the
Beijing University, said that China should make preferential
policies to support the industries for the elderly and improve the
community services for old people. At the same time, enterprises
are encouraged to develop new products for the aged.

<HEADLINE> WHO Chief Calls for Closer Cooperation in Health Improvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The head of the World Health
Organization (WHO) has pledged to work closely with member states
and other United Nations organizations to substantially improve
the health conditions of the world's poorest.
</P>
<P>
"We are not aiming at modest gains," WHO Director-General Gro
Harlem Brundtland said at the 52nd World Health Assembly, WHO's
highest governing body.
</P>
<P>
"In East Asia, life expectancy increased by over 18 years in
the two decades that preceded the most dramatic economic take-off
in history," she told delegates. "Repeat these gains, and we could
be launching a new leap forward for human progress and development.
"
</P>
<P>
In her first speech to the annual assembly since taking office
as WHO's director-general, Brundtland said that her organization
will do its best to ensure that one billion people, who have so
far been excluded from the health "revolution" of the second half
of the 20th century, will see drastic improvements in their health
in the coming decades.
</P>
<P>
To fulfill the task, Brundtland said, WHO is working more
closely with its 191 member states, both through increased day-to-
day cooperation with the missions in Geneva, by establishing a
closer and more strategic work with WHO's executive board, and
through clearer political leadership of the World Health Assembly.
</P>
<P>
She announced that WHO is ready to join the United Nations
Development Group, a collaboration between UN agencies working to
create a common development program for the UN family.
</P>
<P>
Brundtland reiterated that the fight to roll back malaria,
reduce tobacco consumption and ensure safe maternal health are
among WHO's main priorities.

<HEADLINE> Blair Reiterates NATO Demands on Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
reiterated here Tuesday that the five demands raised by NATO on
the Kosovo crisis must be met before ending the alliance's
military operations against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"NATO has set out its demands. Those demands must be met. They
are the minimum demands. Simply, (Yugoslav President Slobodan)
Milosevic takes his troops out of Kosovo, let the international
force go in and the refugees return to their homes and homeland,"
Blair said at a joint press conference with Albanian Prime
Minister Pandeli Majko.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Albanians who gathered before the prime
minister building before his talks with Majko, Blair termed NATO's
barbaric bombardment on Yugoslavia and killing of innocent people
as a "just cause."
</P>
<P>
"After all it is a just cause. We should not rest until it is
successful," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair, who was on a one-day visit to Albania, said the conflict
in Kosovo, a southern Serbian province of Yugoslavia, can be "a
turning point" for the entire Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Majko, for his part, repeated that Albania is "determined" to
support the NATO air strikes until the demands are met.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, the two prime ministers also discussed
bilateral relations and what they believe the future of this
region.
</P>
<P>
After the press conference, Blair drove to the Presidential
Palace to meet Albanian President Rexhep Meidani.

<HEADLINE> Ground Troops Should Not Be Ruled Out: Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said
on Tuesday NATO should not rule out using ground troops in the
Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
"I and everyone else has always said that we intend to see our
objectives achieved and that we have not and will not take any
option off the table," Clinton told reporters when asked if he was
giving more consideration to the use of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
"I think the air war has accomplished quite a bit and there is
a lot more that it can accomplish," Clinton said to reporters at
the start of a meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
The White House has maintained that Clinton has no intention of
deploying ground troops but the president did not stress the point
tuesday as he answered questions from reporters.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's remarks came as reports said Britain was pressing
NATO to consider ground troops while Germany and Italy were
demanding a bombing halt.
</P>
<P>
"We are making progress and I am convinced that we will achieve
our objectives one way or the other," he added.
</P>
<P>
"I am very hopeful, obviously, that the diplomatic efforts that
are being made in the State Department and with the Russians will
bear some fruit," he said. "But if they do not, we will continue
to press ahead."
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that we or our allies should take any options
off the table and that has been my position from the beginning,
that we ought to stay with the strategy that we have and work it
through to the end," he said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, Cameroun Reach Pact on Border Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The agreement emerged Tuesday after two days of talks in
Camerounian capital Yaounde between visiting Nigerian Head of
State Abdulsalam Abubakar and his host, President Paul Biya, a
report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders told reporters after the meeting that the visit
afforded them the opportunity to discuss the dispute and they
hoped that it would be resolved soon.
</P>
<P>
"This gave us the opportunity to discuss the problem of Bakassi
and I am happy that as brothers, we could sit together and discuss
the situation," said Biya.
</P>
<P>
He added that bilateral issues including the resuscitation of
their moribund joint commissions, which was affected by the
strained relations for the past five years, was also discussed.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar's latest gambit, 11 days before he is due to hand
over, is calculated to promote the peaceful resolution to the
conflict which blew into the open in January 1994 after skirmishes
between their troops threatened to erupt into a full-scale war.
</P>
<P>
Since then, lawyers for both sides have been engaged in legal
arguments at the International Court of Justice at the Hague over
the ownership of this swathe of territory, close to their common
border.
</P>
<P>
The grounds for his landmark visit was set in March by Nigerian
 president-elect, Olusegun Obasanjo, when he visited that country
as part of an African tour after his February 27 election.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Control Can Prevent Millions of Deaths Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries can prevent
millions of premature deaths and much disability if they adopt
measures to reduce the demand for tobacco, which are especially
effective among children, adolescents, and the poor, the World
Bank said in a new study released on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The study, Curbing the Epidemic: governments and the Economics
of Tobacco Control, said "the threat posed by smoking to global
health is unprecedented, but so is the potential for reducing
smoking-related mortality with cost-effective policies."
</P>
<P>
According to the study, about 1.1 billion people smoke
worldwide at present, a number that is expected to increase to 1.6
billion by 2025.
</P>
<P>
With current smoking patterns, about 500 million people alive
today will eventually be killed by tobacco use, among them more
than half are children and teenagers, the bank said. By 2030,
tobacco is expected to be the single biggest cause of death
worldwide, accounting for about 10 million deaths per year, it
added.
</P>
<P>
The study found that increasing the price of cigarettes is the
most effective method of reducing demand for cigarettes. On
average, increasing the price of a pack of cigarettes by 10
percent would reduce demand for cigarettes by about 8 percent in
low- to middle-income countries and 4 percent in high-income
countries. Children, adolescents, and the poor are most responsive
to price increases, so this intervention would have a significant
impact on them.
</P>
<P>
To effectively reduce demand for cigarettes, governments also
can ban the advertising and promotion of tobacco products, provide
information on the health risks of smoking directly or through
research, and increase access to nicotine replacement therapy to
help those ready to quit smoking, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The study said a comprehensive tobacco control policy is not
likely to harm economies. Research has shown, for example, that
higher taxes on cigarettes do not erode tobacco tax revenues. Nor
do they cause permanent job losses or massive increases in
smuggling.
</P>
<P>
"Successful control policies usually lead only to a slow
decline in tobacco use. Therefore, any loss of tobacco-farming
jobs would be over decades or more, not overnight," the study
said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from recommendations for governments, the study also
called for action on the part of the international community.
International agencies such as United Nations organizations should
review their existing policies and programs, to ensure that
tobacco control is given due prominence, it said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Criticizes Barak's Comments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Chief Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat Tuesday criticized the comments by Israeli Prime
Minister-elect Ehud Barak on the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Erekat told the Jerusalem Media and Communication Center that
it was regretful that Barak made such comments which "put
impossible issues before the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Barak, leader of the left-wing "One Israel" coalition, won a
landslide victory over the incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in the general elections on Monday.
</P>
<P>
During a speech in Tel Aviv following his victory, Barak said
that Jerusalem is the indivisible and eternal capital of the state
of Israel, ruling out any compromise on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Erekat expressed hope that Barak would realize that the success
of the peace process is not by using power or dictations, but
through understanding principles of international legislation,
which called for Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
Erekat also called on Barak to halt the activities of the
Jewish settlers immediately and to implement the Wye River Memorandum
signed between the two sides last October.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Erekat expressed his congratulations to Barak,
saying that the Israeli people had issued a message of peace
by choosing the left-wing party leader.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the eastern Jerusalem from Jordan in the
1967 Middle East war and later annexed it. And the
Palestinians want to establish their future independent state with
Jerusalem as its capital.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
approved in principle a plan to boost Arab exports to Europe and
was waiting for a final agreement, Chairman of the Italian-Arab
Chamber Sergei Marini said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Marini, who is currently on a visit here, said the project was
an example of joint cooperation among the chamber, the
Cairo-based Arab League and the EU, the Kuwait News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The project calls for the formation of a Rome-based committee
with representatives from each of the three sides to help market
and export their products to Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the trade volume between the Arab states and
Europe remains below standard, adding that annual trade between
Italy and Arab nations, for example, has not exceeded 13 billion
U.S. dollars, accounting for only 6 percent of the total Italian
exports worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Italy and Kuwait reached 426 million dollars in
1998, a 10.2 percent increase compared with 1997.

<HEADLINE> Allegation of Attempted Suicide Concocted: Benazir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's opposition leader
Benazir Bhutto Tuesday said that the allegation that her husband
attempted to commit suicide is concocted and meant to cover up the
brutal torture with a view to murdering the senator.
</P>
<P>
Benazir said, "The allegation that Senator Asif Ali Zardari
attempted to commit suicide while in police custody in Karachi is
the mother of lies concocted by the fascist regime of Nawaz Sharif
to cover up the most brutal and inhuman torture with a view to
murdering Senator Zardari."
</P>
<P>
"No one will believe that a man who courageously endured both
the tenures of Nawaz regime in jail would have attempted to commit
suicide and run away from the cowards of the regime," the
chairwoman of Pakistan People's Party (PPP) added.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here by PPP information office, she
said, "I reject with contempt this latest charade and urge the
judiciary to order an investigation and uncover the plot to murder
the spouse of the leader of opposition."
</P>
<P>
The formal prime minister said that Zardari was already on bail
in the Justice Nizam murder case and he could not have been
remanded to the police custody without the court permission.
</P>
<P>
"What is done to Senator Zardari is the repetition of the
syndrome 'blame the victim' to which the Bhutto family has been
subjected in the past as well," she said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, police sources confirmed that Zardari tried to
cut his throat with a piece of broken glass late Monday night but
was stopped by policemen in time.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the senator was under interrogation on the
Justice Nizam murder case when he broke a drinking water glass and
tried to kill himself.
</P>
<P>
Zardari was again put into jail soon after the replacement of
Benazir's PPP government by Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League
government in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
He had been in jail during Sharif's first tenure as prime
minister in 1990-1993.
</P>
<P>
The Benazir couple were awarded by an anti-corruption court
disqualification for public office, five years' imprisonment and a
fine of 8.6 million U.S. dollars in April this year.

<HEADLINE> Activities Proposed to Publicize COMESA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-governmental Committee of
the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) Tuesday
proposed a number of activities to publicize the organization,
which most of the people in the sub-region know nothing about.
</P>
<P>
Charles Chanthunya, Director of Trade, Customs and Monetary
Affairs of the COMESA Secretariat, revealed this at a press
conference in Kenyan capital Nairobi here.
</P>
<P>
The committee of permanent secretaries from COMESA member
states have been discussing programs and action plans in all the
sectors of cooperation except in the finance and monetary sector.
</P>
<P>
The proposed activities will be implemented in the sub-region
during the count down toward the free trade area by October, 2000,
said Chanthunya.
</P>
<P>
High on the proposed agenda is an extraordinary summit of heads
of state and government on October 31, 2000, when the free trade
area will be launched.
</P>
<P>
And various countries will hopefully stage activities to mark
the occasion. Torches will be lit to symbolize the launching of
the free trade area., he said.
</P>
<P>
There will be business forum for discussions about the
implication of the free trade area in the region.
</P>
<P>
Major trade fairs will be held so that COMESA member states can
exhibit their products and people can see what they can source
from one another.
</P>
<P>
The event is aimed at making people aware of what they can get
from within the region, the COMESA official noted, adding that
some member states are exporting goods to the European countries
while others are importing the same goods from Europe.
</P>
<P>
The inter-governmental committee has even proposed holding
sports activities for women like net ball, in order to advertise
the COMESA.
</P>
<P>
It also suggested an essay competition in secondary schools in
all member states and it will award three prizes for the best
three essays in each member states, an idea of enabling the young
generation to know the COMESA because they are to implement the
COMESA programs and benefit from the programs.
</P>
<P>
They should come to know the COMESA from the very beginning,
said Chanthunya.
</P>
<P>
As proposed, the member states should issue postage stamps from
January next year so that more people will know about the regional
organization.
</P>
<P>
There are a number of other activities proposed to advertise
the sub- regional organization established in 1994 to replace the
Preferential Trade Area for Eastern and Southern Africa which had
been in existence since 1981.
</P>
<P>
Through various activities, more people will know that the
COMESA was established not for its own sake but to benefit all the
people in the sub- region and to raise their living standards,
said Chanthunya.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the COMESA has 21 members: Angola, Burundi, the
Comoros, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Egypt,
Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia,
Rwanda, Seychelles, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and
Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> 63 Candidates Declared Elected, Nepali Congress Leads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-three candidates have been
declared elected to the 205-seat House of Representatives while
the Nepali Congress leads with 38 candidates elected, the Nepal
Television said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist,
CPN-UML) follows with 20 and the National Democratic Party (RPP)
and the National People's Front have two winners each.
</P>
<P>
The other winner is Narayan Man Bijukchhe, president of the
Nepal Workers and Peasants Party.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist, CPN-ML) is
battered in the elections as its two top leaders Sahana Pradhan
and Bam Dev Gautam are both defeated, though Gautam has another
chance in the No. 1 constituency of Kathmandu, where the election
is rescheduled for June 8 after the death of CPN-UML Chairman Man
Mohan Adhikari.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-ML was formed in March 1998 after Gautam and 39 other
MPs broke away from the CPN-UML.
</P>
<P>
Vote counting started at 17:00 (1115 GMT) Monday immediately
after the second-phase parliamentary elections concluded in 39
districts of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The first-phase elections were held on May 3 in 35 districts.
</P>
<P>
Palten Gurung from the Nepali Congress was declared elected

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges U.N. to Halt Deduction of Oil Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has demanded the U.N. Security
Council to halt any deduction of funds from the oil-for-food
program for what it called "illegal purposes under the pretext of
compensation."
</P>
<P>
An unnamed source at the Iraqi Foreign Ministry was quoted by
the Iraqi News Agency on Tuesday as saying that the funds from
Iraqi oil revenues should be used to purchase the necessities for
the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the insistence of the Security Council to
deduct a rate of war compensation provided in the U.N. resolution
705 with its high ceiling of 30 percent had become a big obstacle
to meet the essential needs of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food program, Iraq is allowed to export
limited amount of oil every six months to buy food, medicine and
other humanitarian supplies for its 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq has to pay 30 percent from its oil revenues into
a fund for the 1991 Gulf War victims.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry source said the deduction of such amount
is also an obstacle to rehabilitate the vital facilities such as
sectors of water, sewage and electricity which came under
U.S. and British bombardment last December.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched four-night airstrikes against
Iraq last December to retaliate what they called Iraq's failure
to fully cooperate with U.N. arms inspectors in charge of
eliminating Iraq's prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. panel, set up after the U.S. and British bombardment to
assess the humanitarian situation in Iraq, recommended on March
30 in a report to the Security Council that the 30 percent
deduction from Iraqi oil revenues for war compensation should be
temporarily reduced to improve the humanitarian situation in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The source stressed that those who claimed that they were keen
on alleviating the sufferings of the Iraqi people should work for
lifting the U.N. sanctions and stopping the extravagance of their
wealth.

<HEADLINE> UK Conservative Unveils Euro Manifesto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Conservative Party leader
William Hague on Tuesday branded his right-wing challengers
"fanatics" in the run-up to the European election.
</P>
<P>
Unveiling the Tories' Euro manifesto, Hague stuck to his
strategy of promising not to lead the United Kingdom into the
single currency in the lifetime of the next parliament.
</P>
<P>
Hague insisted no danger existed of his party falling into a
void between the two positions in the June 10 poll.
</P>
<P>
"There isn't a gap in the middle - that's where they British
people are," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are the only party who speak up for the majority of people
in this election."
</P>
<P>
Hague refused to predict his party's performance in the Euro
vote, but he appealed to voters to reject "election fatigue" and
use poll to give their verdict on the government.
</P>
<P>
In the manifesto, the Conservatives key message is that they
would seek a European Union composed of more countries but with
fewer areas of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Hague insisted this approach chimed with the views of the
British people and would bring his party success in the election.

MUSCAT, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China wishes to work together with
Oman to usher the long-term and stable ties between the two
countries into a new century, said Li Ruihuan, visiting Chairman
of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks while meeting with President of the Omani
Consultative Council Abdullah Bin Ali Bin Mohammed Al-Qatabi.
</P>
<P>
China and Oman share mutual understanding and support each
other in international affairs and the cooperation between the two
countries is based on sound foundation and has bright future, said
the Chinese top adviser who arrived here Monday evening for a
state visit.
</P>
<P>
To further promote the Chinese-Omani ties is not only in the
interests of the two peoples but also conducive to strengthening
unity and cooperation among developing countries, Li said.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Al-Qatabi expressed belief that Li's visit will
further promote bilateral ties which have a long history and
have witnessed exchange of visits by high-ranking officials since
the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Oman hopes that China will play a bigger role in regional and
international affairs, said Al-Qatabi, adding that Oman
appreciates China for its consistent support for the Arab people's
just course.
</P>
<P>
The Omani Consultative Council wishes to boost its friendly
ties with the CPPCC, said Al-Qatabi.

<P>
BONN, May 18 (Xinhua)-- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and
French President Jacques Chirac on Tuesday said they supported
China's bid for the World Trade Organization (WTO) membership.
</P>
<P>
A quick WTO membership for China with full rights and duties in
the multilateral trade system is in the interest of Germany and
France, other WTO members, and China itself, said Schroeder and
Chirac in a joint statement issued both in Bonn and in Paris.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the most important trade partners of the
European Union, and has been integrated with the world trade in a
considerable degree, they said.
</P>
<P>
"Because of that, Germany and France support with emphasis
China's entrance to the WTO, "the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders said they "expressly acknowledged" China's
endeavor of creating the necessary conditions for entering WTO.
</P>
<P>
The current procedure on China's WTO membership should bring a
successful conclusion, with which China is able to take part in
the next round multilateral trade negotiations of the WTO, said
Schroeder and Chirac.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Protests Over Enhanced Turkish Role in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavian Ambassador to Ankara
Darko Tanaskovic Tuesday extended an oral protest to the Turkish
Foreign Ministry for Turkey's intensifying participation in the
NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Tanaskovic met with Turkish Foreign Ministry Deputy
Undersecretary Aydin Sahinbas following the reports about the
direct Turkish participation in the bombardments and Turkey's
opening of three air bases for warplanes participating in the NATO
air strikes.
</P>
<P>
NATO will dispatch 72 F-15 and F-16 fighter jets to the
military bases in Bandirma, Balikesir and Corlu in western Turkey
before the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
NATO is expected to launch attacks on the targets in
Yugoslavia from Turkey via an air corridor which Bulgaria opened
for NATO.
</P>
<P>
Tanaskovic expressed Yugoslavia's deep concern that Turkey's
intensified involvement in the bombing would further harm the
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
However, the Turkish Foreign Ministry declined to officially
confirm press reports that Turkish warplanes have been
participating in the bombardments directly since late April.
</P>
<P>
Turkish fighter jets initially had been assigned only with
defense missions.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 11 Turkish F-16 warplanes are stationed at NATO
bases in Italy to participate in NATO's air campaign against
Yugoslavia launched on March 24.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Calls for Increased Fishery Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Tuesday called for increased
cooperation in managing and utilizing fish resources among
countries sharing Lake Tanganyika.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, Food and Fisheries Minister Suresh Desai made the
appeal during the official opening of the eighth session of
Committee for Inland Fisheries of Africa (CIFA) sub-committee for
Lake Tanganyika.
</P>
<P>
Lake Tanganyika is an important source of fish and a source of
employment for the people in the region, he said. The resources
of the lake which covers over 32,000 square kilometers are shared
by Burundi, Tanzania, Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC).
</P>
<P>
About 30,000 fishers and more than 50 commercial fishing
companies in Zambia depend on the lake and the companies produce
12,000 to 15,000 tons of fish every year in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the fisheries sector is the third
largest employer after agriculture and mining in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Closer regional cooperation is essential for the management
and sustainable utilization of the common resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
The rational management of the fisheries sector in Zambia is
being constrained by lack of adequate trained man-power in
disciplines such as fisheries biology, ecology, technology,
management techniques as well as aquaculture technology, noted
Desai.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Maembe, chairman of the Food and Agricultural
Organization (FAO/ CIFA) sub-committee for Lake Tanganyika, said
there is need for up-to-date information on the state of fish
resources and other mechanisms to control industrial pollution,
bad agricultural and fishing practices on the lake.
</P>
<P>
The four-day meeting is being attended by representatives from
the countries sharing the lake, Food and Agriculture Organization,
United Nations Development Program (UNDP), among others.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve decided
Tuesday that inflation is not signalling a threat to justify an
immediate increase in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), composed of Fed board
members and regional bank presidents, ended closed-door
discussions with a decision to leave the target for the federal
funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, unchanged.
</P>
<P>
This marked the Fed's first use of a new procedure, put into
effect in December, by which the central bank immediately informs
the public of major shifts in its views about the balance of risks
to the economy. In the past, the central bank has waited eight
weeks before revealing in its minutes any changes in its policy
bias.
</P>
<P>
"While the FOMC did not take action today to alter the stance
of monetary policy, the committee was concerned about the
potential for a buildup of inflationary imbalances that could
undermine the favorable performance of the economy," the Fed said
in an one-page statement.
</P>
<P>
The Fed added that it therefore had "adopted a directive that
is tilted toward the possibility of firming in the stance of
monetary policy."
</P>
<P>
Its decision to leave rates unchanged had been expected despite
a worrisome 0.7 percent rise in consumer prices reported Friday,
the biggest one-month increase in nine years.
</P>
<P>
"Against the background of already-tight domestic labor markets
and ongoing strength in demand in excess of productivity gains,
the committee recognizes the need to be alert to developments over
coming months that might indicate that financial conditions may no
longer be consistent with containing inflation," the Fed statement
concluded.
</P>
<P>
While analysts had expected the Fed to leave rates alone, many
had forecast that the Fed would for the first time use its new
signaling tool to put financial markets on notice that the central
bank was leaning toward raising rates in the future.
</P>
<P>
Evidence that the economy might be slowing on its own came
earlier today when the Commerce Department reported that housing
construction fell 10.1 percent in April, the biggest monthly drop
in more than five years.
</P>
<P>
The Fed's next policymaking meeting is on June 29-30. While
some economists believe a rate increase could occur then, many
believe the central bank will wait until its August meeting to
start raising rates if the economy has not slowed enough on its
own and inflationary pressures are building.
</P>
<P>
The Fed last changed the federal funds rate in the fall of
1998, cutting it three times in an effort to restore investor
confidence and avert a worldwide recession. The funds rate has
been at 4.75 percent since Nov. 17.

<HEADLINE> European Markets Close Higher in Thin Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Europe's main stock markets closed
up Tuesday as U.S. housing data allayed fears about an imminent
hike in interest rates and Wall Street's upbeat start.
</P>
<P>
London's expectations 100 was the weakest of the main bourses
but still added 41 points to close at 6206.4, a rise of 0.66
percent.
</P>
<P>
Britain's inflation data for April released on the day, which
showed that price rises were the lowest since November 1993, did
little for the market as the numbers were in line with
expectations.
</P>
<P>
However, the figures showed that UK price rises had fallen
below the government's target, reducing the likelihood of any
imminent interest rate rise.
</P>
<P>
Germany's electronic Xetra Dax closed firmly in positive
territory, holding on to most of the gains made in the morning
session to close up 58 points, or 1.15 percent, at 5160.47.
</P>
<P>
The CAC 40 in Paris put in the strongest performance Tuesday of
the main Europe's bourses, to end up 1.5 percent at 4312.74, a
rise of almost 64 points.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Government Appeals for Pressure on Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spencer said President Kabbah went to Lome to hold
consultations with Sankoh and expressed the hope that the rebel
leader and his side will see reason.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his government's position to grant amnesty to
the rebels and their allies to form a political party and
contest elections later.
</P>
<P>
He said that amnesty could only be granted to Sankoh according
to the rule of law, inferring that he will have to go through
court proceedings and later be pardoned by President Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Spencer also kicked against another proposal to replace the
current government in Sierra Leone with a transitional body to run
the country and organize elections after four years.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah's term of office ends in February 2001.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation in Sierra Leone is a real test case for
democracy in the African region which, if not given the needed
attention by all, could spill over to other countries on the
continent.
</P>
<P>
He repeated allegations that the crisis is being fuelled by
the governments of Liberia and Burkina Faso with the support of
Libya as part of a master plan to cripple countries that have the
potential to achieve success in development.
</P>
<P>
Some international crook businessmen and drug barons are also
involved, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, between 600,000 and 700,000 children have
been killed since the rebels renewed their attacks in January.
</P>
<P>
"Some girls, who managed to escape after they had been raped by
the rebels, are now pregnant, while some have contracted the
dreadful AIDS disease."
</P>
<P>
"The crisis in my country is not a civil war as some people
want the world to believe. It is a rebel war," he said.
</P>
<P>
Spencer made reference to the international attention being
given to the Kosovo crisis and expressed regrets that while the
war in Sierra Leone is much more serious, little attention is
being paid to it.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he would not call for the bombardment of rebel
positions in Sierra Leone, as is being done by NATO in Yugoslavia.
 Instead he would prefer more human and material resources for
west African intervention force ECOMOG to intensify its
peacekeeping.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Arrives in Accra for Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa
 arrived in Accra, capital of Ghana, Tuesday to participate in the
Fifth African-African American Summit.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with newsmen at the airport, Mkapa said the
summit is a historic one, which should chart a way forward for
increased collaboration between Africans and African Americans
"as we enter the new millennium," the Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said to realize the common aspirations of the summit, there
is the need for African Americans to revitalize the link between
them and their brothers and sisters on the continent.
</P>
<P>
"We should be ambitious and accept our rightful place in the
geo- politics and economies of the world," said Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
Ghanaian President Jerry John Rawlings, who went to the airport
to meet Mkapa, said there is no justification for poverty in
Africa taking into consideration the abundance of human and
natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Africa needs the technical and financial support of
African-Americans, he said, urging African-Americans to "return to
their mother continent to offer catalytic assistance that would
help both sides achieve their aim".
</P>
<P>
He cited an example of Irish Americans, Jewish Americans and
others who have been able to take their expertise to their
mother country and questioned why the same cannot happen in
Africa. "We must take advantage of the summit and move ahead."
</P>
<P>
Presidents of Cote d'Ivoire, Senegal, King of Swaziland and
second vice- president of Burundi also arrived Tuesday for the
summit.

<HEADLINE> Britain Pledges to Continue Efforts on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- British High Commissioner to
Cyprus Edward Clay Wednesday reiterated that Britain will
contribute to efforts aimed at settling the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Clay held his first meeting with Nicos Anastasiades, leader of
Cyprus' ruling rightwing Democratic Rally party, since he assumed
office as British new High Commissioner to Cyprus last week.
</P>
<P>
Anastsiades said they discussed the latest developments in
the Cyprus issue and the crisis in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
He said he stressed the need for Britain to exhibit the
necessary will so that progress on the Cyprus issue leading to a
peaceful settlement is reached.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The British diplomat Wednesday also had a meeting with Demetris
Christofias, General Secretary of the opposition left-wing AKEL
party.
</P>
<P>
An AKEL press release said Christofias told Clay that efforts
for finding a solution to the Cyprus issue should remain within
the framework of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Christofias repeated AKEL's stand for an immediate end to the
NATO bombing on Yugoslavia, adding a solution should be reached
through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The NATO began bombing against Yugoslavia's Serb targets on
March 24 after the Serb-led government refused to accept a peace
agreement to grant great autonomy to the independence-seeking
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Wednesday began closed-door consultations on the conflicts between
Ethiopia and Eritrea, which featured the briefing on the latest
development in the Horn of Africa by the U.N. special envoy,
Mohamed Sahnoun.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council session kicked off after Ethiopia launched
a dawn bombing raid on an Eritrean city Sunday, its second strikes
in two days and a sign that a month of peace negotiations were
floundering.
</P>
<P>
Shanoun, who just returned from a visit to the region, was
seeking a ceasefire as a first step towards ending the war, U.N.
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea have been fighting over their
1,000-kilometer border, which was not clearly marked when Eritrea
gained its independence from Ethiopia in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Both the African countries have accepted a peace plan hammered
out by the Organization of African Unity (OAU), but they disagree
over how to implement it. The plan calls for both parties to
withdraw from areas captured since the start of the war in May
last year.

<HEADLINE> Finland, Russia, U.S. End Kosovo Talks Without Outcome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Finland, Russia and the U.S. ended
their "constructive" talks on the Kosovo issue here by Tuesday
noon, but didn't work out a final proposal.
</P>
<P>
But the Finnish presidential office described the seven-hour
talks, which began Monday afternoon, as "very serious and
constructive."
</P>
<P>
Three delegations led respectively by Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari, Russian President Envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin and U.S.
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott discussed the political
settlement of Kosovo crisis and the possibility for Finland to be
a coordinator.
</P>
<P>
All the sides were seeking ways to cooperation closely in the
process of settling the conflict peacefully under the principle
agreed by the Group of Eight, the presidential office said.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari expressed satisfaction over the talks. He will meet
Chernomyrdin and Talbott again later in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The Russian envoy headed for Belgrade after the talks and
Talbott went to Bonn to brief G-8 delegates about the talks.
</P>
<P>
Local diplomatic sources held the view that grave difference
remains among the three parties on the precondition of halting
military actions and the following international supervision.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Ambassador to Russia Borislav Milosevic told the
Finnish News Agency on Tuesday that Ahtisaari is welcome to join
the possible Kosovo peace talks attended by conflicting sides and
the international community.
</P>
<P>
He said Yugoslavia is considering to arrange talks on the
partial autonomy in Kosovo, ethnic Albanian refugees' returning
home and international peace keeping in the area.
</P>
<P>
But, he stressed there will be no talks if NATO refuses to halt
its bombing.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Serb forces in Kosovo have yet to
suffer more losses from airstrikes, but NATO's bombing campaign
has not inflicted significant casualties on the Yugoslav army so
far, a British military official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's troops were
gradually being weakened throughout Serbia and especially in
Kosovo, Deputy Chief of the Defense Staff Air Marshal John Day
told the daily Ministry of Defense briefing.
</P>
<P>
"Although they have yet to suffer significant casualties, we
know from intelligence that they are finding it progressively
harder to operate," Day said.
</P>
<P>
His comments came as government leaders of NATO are struggling
to come up with a unified policy on if and when to deploy ground
troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said on Wednesday that he
was opposed to sending troops to invade Kosovo. He said the
invasion was "unthinkable" while the British government repeatedly
said that NATO must consider sending ground troops into Kosovo.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Greece fully supports the initiative
under way in the framework of a proposal by seven Western
countries and Russia, known as the Group of Eight, Greek Deputy
Foreign Minister Yiannos Kranidiotis said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement after chairing a tripartite meeting here
on coordinating humanitarian aid shipments to Yugoslavia attended
by Russian Emergency Services Minister Sergei Soygu, Director of
Development Cooperation of the Swiss Foreign Ministry Walther Fist,
and Alexander Rondos, the Greek Foreign Minister's Balkans envoy.
</P>
<P>
Kranidiotis expressed the hope that Yugoslavia will accept the
terms to be presented by Russia's emissary Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas Wednesday also said
that Athens is now doing all it can towards a political solution
to the Yugoslav crisis and welcomed the fact that the "front of
countries" which are in favor of such a solution is broadening.
</P>
<P>
He said that a political solution to the Yugoslav crisis is
nearer than ever but warned against excessive optimism.
</P>
<P>
To help find a speedy political settlement of the crisis, Greek
Foreign Minister George Papandreou has begun a series of

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives passed a 15 billion-dollar package to fund the air
strikes against Yugoslavia on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The emergency spending measure, passed by a vote of 269 to 158,
included 11.9 billions to cover the U.S. costs of NATO's bombing
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton wanted half that amount, but republicans
said the extra money was needed to rebuild armed services.
</P>
<P>
A Senate passage of the bill is possible Wednesday, Congress
sources said. Senate passage would clear the way for Clinton to
sign the bill into law.
</P>
<P>
The package also included 1 billion dollars for hurricane-
battered Central America, 100 million dollars for Jordan, more
than 574 million in aid to U.S. farmers and 900 million dollars to
help the Federal Emergency Management Agency cope with recent
disasters such as the tornadoes that ripped through Kansas and
Oklahoma.

<HEADLINE> IAAF Appoints Panel to Study Ben Johnson Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, May 19 (Xinhua) -- IAAF, world track's governing body,
set up a three-man panel Wednesday to study Canadian sprinter Ben
Johnson's petition for his lifetime drug ban to be lifted,
according to reports from Seville.
</P>
<P>
On the first day of its two-day Council meeting in Seville, the
International Amateur Athletic Federation appointed a sub-
commission to consider Johnson's application for reinstatement,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
IAAF general secretary Istvan Gyulai, honorary treasurer Robert
Stinson of Britain and Council member Helmut Digel of Germany were
appointed to the panel.
</P>
<P>
A Canadian adjudicator ruled last month that the 37-year-old
Johnson's application should be allowed to go ahead.
</P>
<P>
Johnson was stripped of his Olympic gold medal and 100-meter
world record after testing positive for steroids at the 1988 Seoul
Olympic Games. After serving a two-year suspension, he was banned
for life by the IAAF after a second positive test in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The ruling of the adjudicator, Graeme Mew, was based on alleged
procedural errors in the handling of Johnson's lifetime suspension.
</P>
<P>
IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said the panel will submit its
recommendations on Johnson's case at the next council meeting
August 16-17 in Seville.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales and catering trade

in Singapore in March 1999, according to data released Wednesday

Compared with February 1999, retail sales and catering trade in

Dealers of textiles and personal effects encountered a marginal
reduction of 0.5 percent in sales and business at department

KUNMING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Fifth World Potato Congress
will be held in the Chinese city of Kunming in the year 2003,
according to an agreement reached here today.

development, Lloyd Palmer, the chairman of the World Potato
Congress, said.
</P>
<P>
Annual potato output in Yunnan is 700,000 tons, about 6 percent
of China's total. Local officials expect that the congress will
promote development of the industry.
</P>

<HEADLINE> S. African Policemen Face Charges Over Brutality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-two policemen who were
involved in two cases of police brutality shown in a BBC
television documentary should be prosecuted, the Independent
Complaints Directorate (ICD) recommended Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ICD is a watchdog body charged with monitoring police
conduct.
</P>
<P>
Gauteng provincial ICD director Shadrack Mahlangu told a press
conference here that while not all of the members were directly
implicated in the assaults, they were also considered to be guilty
because they had failed to stop the assaults.
</P>
<P>
Mahlangu said the investigation's findings and the case dockets
had been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions with the
recommendation that 12 policemen be charged in connection with an
incident on January 16 this year and 12 policemen with regard to a
second incident on January 24. Two policemen were implicated in
both assaults.
</P>
<P>
In the first incident, BBC footage showed police officers
setting police dogs on suspects who were lying handcuffed on the
ground and stubbing out a cigarette on one suspect's head.
</P>
<P>
The footage of the second incident showed police chasing a BMW
car which had been hijacked in downtown Johannesburg. During the
chase, the hijackers, one black and one colored, crashed into a
tree.
</P>
<P>
Policemen were shown pulling the injured men from the car and
hitting a suspect with rifle butt.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question on the possible public reaction to the
ICD's decision, following an outpouring of sympathy for the
suspended policemen, Mahlangu said the public response was
probably motivated by an escalation in crime.
</P>
<P>
He said while he understood the public's frustration,
vigilantism would not bring crime down to an acceptable level.
</P>
<P>
"We need to improve policy and ways of helping the police cope
with the stresses of their work," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahlangu said there was no excuse for assaulting men already in
custody, especially when one was already injured.
</P>
<P>
"After the second incident, one suspect was subjected to
criminal prosecution and sentenced to 15 years in jail for
hijacking. That is the proper way without taking the law into your
own hands," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahlangu said a separate division of the ICD would be examining
 statistics and conducting studies to determine the extent to
which police brutality was a problem.
</P>
<P>
He said it was hoped the unit would be able go beyond the
processes and determine ways in which such problems could be
addressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, during a
visit to Yunnan Province on May 16-19, said that China should take
advantage of good opportunities to boost the development of its
tourist industry.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that the number of foreign tourists in China in the
first quarter increased 15.5 percent from the same period last
year and that domestic tourism is booming and that this provides a
solid base for developing tourism this year.
</P>
<P>
China's tourism will also be blessed by the central
government's decision to make tourism a new economic growth point,
the return of Macao to the motherland in December, the 50th
anniversary of the People's Republic of China, and the arrival of
the year 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged all regions to place great importance on improving
tourism and said that the quality of service is vital to the
industry.
</P>
<P>
The NATO attack on the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia on May 7
has caused great indignation among the Chinese, he said, adding
the anger should be turned into strength to do work well and
create a better tourist environment to serve tourists from at home
and abroad.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Broaden Access to Long-term Finance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Finance Minister Edith Nawakwi
Wednesday called on Zambians to broaden access to long-term
finance to include individuals and other entrepreneurs with viable
proposals to invest in Zambia's economy.
</P>
<P>
"We must make long-term finance as inclusive as possible if the
funds provided are to have any meaningful impact on the economy,"
the minister said while opening the Trade and Enterprise Support
Facility (TESF) Conference here.
</P>
<P>
Nawakwi noted with sadness that a very large majority of
potential entrepreneurs and business people had been marginalized
in the acquisition of capital for their investment.
</P>
<P>
She said large corporate groups and wealthy individuals were
more favored in the access to investment finance than individuals
and small businesses.
</P>
<P>
"We have marginalized a very large majority of potential
entrepreneurs and business people," she said.
</P>
<P>
Nawakwi noted that while there has been an encouraging inflow
of long- term development finance from the European Union (EU) and
other donors, the funds would not have the desired impact on the
economy as long as a large section of potential investors remain
marginalized.
</P>
<P>
The minister also observed that Zambia's financial market had
for a long time been inclined to short-term lending, thereby
leading to entrepreneurs with long-term projects failing in their
investments.
</P>
<P>
She said the arrangement had forced entrepreneurs intending to
develop long-term projects to be compelled to invariably plan on
very short time horizons to conform to the existing pattern of
financing.
</P>
<P>
This means that there is an abject shortage of long-term
development finance that is critical for stimulation of
investment, she said.
</P>
<P>
She added that the government had released close to six million
U.S. dollars during the past two years and 12 million dollars over
the past six months to boost investment in this southern African
country.
</P>
<P>
Nawakwi said the government was currently working on proposals
to restructure the Development Bank of Zambia (DBZ) for it to
become a viable source of long- and short-term development
finance.
</P>
<P>
She said this would be done by increasing the number of
share-holders so that financial institutions could be involved in
the running of the development bank.
</P>
<P>
The conference was attended by representatives from over 12
financial institutions.

<P>
Li said that advancing Sino-Japanese good-neighborly friendship
is the aspiration of the two countries' people and is in the
interest of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
They should make joint efforts to push bilateral ties forward
by carrying out the agreements reached during Chinese President
Jiang Zemin's Japan visit last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said the association, the largest organization for Sino-
Japanese friendship in the Japanese Diet, has played an important
role in furthering bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that Hayashi and his colleagues in the
association would make greater efforts to promote Sino-Japanese
relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that Japan has explained the acts concerning the new
Japan-U.S. Defense Guidelines to China many times but that it is
more important to see how Japan will act. He said China hopes that
Japan would adhere to peaceful development.
</P>
<P>
Hayashi said that the attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade
was a tragic event and he expressed his condolences. He said he
fully understands the Chinese people's feelings.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the attack was a serious thing and that it was
very natural that it produced the strong indignation of the
Chinese people and the strong reaction of the Chinese government
and that President Jiang Zemin explained China's stance clearly in
his telephone conversation with President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese are here at the invitation of the NPC Foreign
Affairs Committee.

<HEADLINE> Malawian President Calls for Emergency Assembly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Malawian President Bakili Muluzi
has directed that the National Assembly of the country, which was
dissolved this March in view of the May presidential elections, be
reconvened Friday.
</P>
<P>
The presidential decree says that former members of the
National Assembly should arrive in Malawi's capital Lilongwe
Thursday to sit for the May 21 emergency assembly, the Malawi News
Agency (MNA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Muluzi's directive for the parliament's emergency session is in
 compliance with last Sunday's May 16 High Court's conditional
injunction in Blantyre to hold the general elections scheduled for
May 25.
</P>
<P>
Four contending presidential aspirants from opposition Malawi
Congress Party/Alliance for Democracy Alliance (MCP/AFORD), Malawi
Democratic Party (MDP), United Party and a newly-formed party
previously made an application to defer the date for the second
multi-party elections.
</P>
<P>
The presidential contenders Gwanda Chakuamba, candidate for
(MCP/AFORD) alliance, Kamlepo Kalua of MDP, Bringu Wa Muthalika
for the United Party and the National Congress, Bishop Nkhumbwe
took Malawi's Electoral commission to court for setting May 25 as
the general elections date since the electoral body had extended
registration period to May 14 without considering what they
postulated was "the implications to the extension of the
registration date."
</P>
<P>
The contenders' major contention held that 21 days lapse from
the last day of registration.
</P>
<P>
The candidates, who on May 10 petitioned the High Court to bar
the commission from holding the elections on May 25, threatened to
contest the poll results otherwise.
</P>
<P>
The presidential aspirants argued that the electoral commission
had violated the presidential and elections act when it extended
the voter registration period from May 3 to May 14 but said it
subsequently refused to honor the 21 days intermission before
polling day.
</P>
<P>
In his judgement, High Court judge Justice Chimasula Phiri
said it was unlawful for the commission not to allow for the 21
days intermission after last day of registration for it denied
eligible voters and stake-holders enough time to inspect the voter
register.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Muluzi was against the poll date extension at a
rally, saying, "Malawi is a very poor country, extension of the
polling date would have serious economic implications."

<HEADLINE> China Preparing For Possible Yellow River Flooding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Vice-premier Wen Jiabao, the head
of State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, has asked
local governments along the Yellow River to be prepared for
possible floods this summer.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of severe flooding on the Yellow River has been
increasing, efforts should be made for the coming flooding season,
and officials should have a clear understanding of the tough
situation this year and be ready to deal with possible problems,
Wen said at a recent meeting on flood control in the city of
Zhengzhou, in central China.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River has caused frequent disasters over the past 2,
500 years and dykes on the lower reaches have been breached more
than 1,500 times.
</P>
<P>
The river has withstood floods for the past several decades,
Wen said, but meteorologists forecast more rainfall on the middle
and lower reaches this year. Many sections of the river have
silted up and are vulnerable, he said, and there are problems with
the dykes.
</P>
<P>
A good flood prevention job is vital to the safety of tens of
millions of people and their property and will have a major impact
on the nation's reforms, development and stability, Wen said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the importance of speeding up construction on
water conservation projects in the area and asked departments to
ensure the quality of the projects and to make detailed emergency
plans and to have sufficient flood-control materials.
</P>
<P>
He said that emergency personnel should be trained and the army
and local people should increase cooperation.

<HEADLINE> India Expresses Surprise Over U.S. Ship Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- India expressed total surprise
Wednesday over the reported expedition by United States scientists
to the Bay of Bengal without any knowledge of any agency in the
Indian government.
</P>
<P>
"This is a surprise to us," a senior official of the Ministry
of Science and Technology said here Wednesday, adding that the
ministry was not consulted or informed.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said that a joint of several American and
Australian agencies began activities on April 26 from the U. S.
research ship Ron Brown in the Bay of Bengal in the northeast
Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the University of Colorado said that
two-million-U.S.-dollar joint air and sea monsoon interaction
experiment would continue for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
The project is directed by the Center for Atmospheric and
Oceanic Sciences of the university and the team would study the
upper 400 meters of the ocean and its interaction with the
overlying atmosphere, the release said.
</P>
<P>
"We do not know anything about this," said Muthunayagam,
secretary of the Department of Ocean Development, which also keeps
track of developments in Indian waters.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that not only was the Indian government kept in
the dark but no Indian scientist was invited to participate
despite the fact that India and the U.S. have vigorous
collaboration in atmospheric research.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for India's concern is that it can not be
ascertained whether the expedition has been conducted in Indian or
international waters since messages to the University of Colorado
officials, asking about the location of the ship, have remained
unanswered.

<P>
The Shanghai Mingzhu metro, which is now under construction, is
the city's third subway. It is 25 kilometers long and is scheduled
to go operational next year.
</P>

The train has 356 seats and room for 2,140 people to stand and
runs at 80 kilometers per hour, the source says.

LONDON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
unveiled Labour's European election campaign on Wednesday with a
warning that a vote for the Conservative Party would leave the
country sidelined in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Blair said that only his party could make Britain a leader in
Europe and properly represent the interests of British businesses.
</P>
<P>
The Conservatives were too split to provide leadership and
their extremism made them incapable of representing British firms,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair said the poll on June 10 offered voters a choice "between
strong leadership and the splits and divisions that did so much to
damage Britain's interests under the Tories."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister insisted that Labour had a bold agenda for
reform of Europe's economy, defense and the European institutions
so that nations can act more decisively to achieve common goals.
</P>
<P>
The Labour manifesto calls for the completion of the single
market, making the euro a success and strengthening the "European
social model."
</P>
<P>
It also calls for a Europe that "puts the citizen first,"
ensures a healthy environment and measures to bring the European
Union closer to the people.
</P>
<P>
Labour's campaign is getting underway after the publication of
the Liberal Democrat and Conservative manifestos earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
More than 700 candidates have entered the ring for Britain's
seats in the European Parliament elections which will be the first
nationwide proportional representation election.

BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Defense Minister Chi Haotian, in a
meeting here today with Thai army Commander-in-chief Surayut
Chulanont, reiterated the Chinese government's stance toward the
US-led NATO attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade on May 7.
</P>
<P>
Chi said the US-led NATO must apologize to the Chinese people

comprehensive investigation into it, announce results of the
investigation, and punish those responsible.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, he said, the Chinese people will not be satisfied.
</P>
<P>
Since China and Thailand forged diplomatic ties, there has been
fruitful bilateral cooperation in all fields, Chi said. He added
that he has been to Thailand five times and that made him realize
the deep feeling of the Thai people and army for China.
</P>
<P>
He also said he believes that Surayut Chulanont's visit will
push forward the friendship and cooperation between the two
countries and their military forces.
</P>
<P>
Surayut said that his China visit has allowed him to learn more
about military education and training in China.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard Shroeder
said here on Wednesday that the Western allies should continue
their efforts towards a long term goal of the political settlement
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
After meeting NATO's Secretary General Javier Solana and

with the current crisis in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
Military campaign must continue to stop the violence there, while
diplomatic efforts must be made for political settlement, he said.
</P>
<P>
The German chancellor also said the NATO allies have different
positions on sending the offensive ground troops into Kosovo and
the timing to stop bombing for a possible political agreement.
</P>
<P>
He said Germany is opposed to sending invasive ground troops
before a political agreement is reached, but his country supports
for current NATO strategy of sending multi-national security
forces into Kosovo escorting refugees under a UN mandate.
</P>
<P>
All the parties relating to the Kosovo conflict should narrow
their gaps in order to reach a synchronized position for a UN
resolution on the Kosovo crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Shroeder also said the NATO's strategy has not been changed and
"is successfully carried out." Asked if the NATO allies' position
is the same as that of the European Union (EU), Schroeder said
both the organizations' positions are crystal clear, and he
thought "they are identical."
</P>
<P>
Currently, Russian diplomats are busy making political efforts
and some European leaders are also shuttling within Europe to seek
political solution, which NATO spokesman Jamie Shea described as "
a week of diplomacy." However, observers here said if the NATO's
bombing is still going on, it is very hard to find a way to reach
political solution to the Balkan crisis in a short period of time.

<HEADLINE> Karachi Stock Index Up 3.8 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KARACHI, Pakistan, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The government's decision
of unified exchange rate created bullish sentiments on the Karachi
Stock Exchange (KSE) as the index closed 3.78 percent higher in
expectation of return of foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
The KSE-100 share price index rose 46.30 points to 1,269.09
Wednesday against Tuesday's 1,222.79 on a volume of 160.898
million shares.
</P>
<P>
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Tuesday night announced
unification of foreign exchange rate which paves the way for
conversion of frozen foreign currency deposits (FCD) at a rate
close to 51 rupees to the U.S. dollar instead of 46 rupees.
</P>
<P>
A SBP circular said the official exchange rate (46 rupees to
the dollar) has been abolished and the floating inter-bank rate
shall apply to all foreign exchange receipts and payments both in
public and in private sectors. The decision is effective from May
19.
</P>
<P>
"The decision of SBP encouraged market players to go for heavy
buying as they are expecting return of foreign investment owing to
exchange rate relaxation," said Yusuf Ahmad, chief trader of Arif
Habib Securities.
</P>
<P>
Until now, there were three exchange rates: first, the official
rate of 46 rupees to a dollar which applied only to imports of
wheat and petroleum products and conversion of FCDs and bonds;
second, floating inter-bank rate determined by the banks through
interaction of market forces; and third, composite exchange rate
with a mix-up of 95 percent of floating rate and 5 percent of
official rate.
</P>
<P>
Yusuf said the foreigners who were reluctant to invest owing to
their losses in taking out frozen accounts would now be
comfortable at the new development.
</P>
<P>
Of the 191 active shares, gainers outnumbered losers 117 to 39
while 35 remained unchanged. The market capitalization rose to
338.723 billion rupees against Tuesday's 327.740 billion rupees.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Paper Slams U.S.-led NATO for Attacking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A newspaper in Ethiopia
Wednesday condemned the U.S.-led NATO for using missiles to attack
the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia on May 7, describing it as a
"terrorist act".
</P>
<P>
In a signed article titled "A mistake or a deliberate act?",
"The Reporter" paper condemned the U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) for employing the same method as the
"terrorists, harming the innocent to attain their goals."
</P>
<P>
NATO's air strike on Yugoslavia has lasted for nearly two
months and is still going on, "killing thousands of innocent
people and destroying basic infrastructures which solely give
service to civilians, like bridges, hospitals, electric power
stations, telecommunication systems, water projects, TV stations,
and even trains and buses," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO forces attacked the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade with
five missiles, killing three Chinese correspondents and wounding
more than 20 diplomats.
</P>
<P>
The independent Ethiopian paper dismissed NATO claim of
mistaking the Chinese embassy for a "hotel serving as a military
base for Yugoslavia" as " an absurd excuse".
</P>
<P>
"By analyzing some factual circumstances, one can again prove
that NATO's target was nothing but the Chinese embassy itself," it
noted. "When there is no site around the embassy that is
targeted, NATO's claim is an absurd excuse - just a pretext."
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. claims to be the guardian of international law and
human rights, what is witnessed in NATO's air strike is that it
breaks the law which it says it stands for - if this is serving
their purpose," said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The paper also asked the international community to condemn
this " atrocious and inhuman act," blaming the U.S. led NATO for
"violating international law and human rights."

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Ministers Explain Depletion of Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The out-going military government of
Nigeria has said that essential spendings and low oil prices had
accounted for the drop in the country's foreign exchange reserve.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a special press briefing in capital Abuja Tuesday,
Information Minister John Nwodo said that the press briefing had
become necessary in view of persistent criticisms by local media
which had accused the military government of running down the
nation's foreign reserve.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that Nigeria had more than six billion U.S. dollars
in its foreign reserve in June last year when the administration
came into power and the nation's foreign reserve had dropped to
3.4 billion dollars as at today, press reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At the press briefing which were attended by eight ministers
including finance and national planning ministers, Nwodo said that
while net earnings from oil dropping from one billion dollars in
January 1998 to 335 million dollars last December, the present
government had had to settle joint venture cash calls, maintain
power plants and the refineries at extra costs.
</P>
<P>
"Nigeria's involvement in ECOMOG (west African peace-keeping
force) operations (in Sierra Leone) was another drain in
resources," Nwodo noted, adding that the conduct of the transition
program and the hosting of the World Youth Soccer Championship had
also contributed to the depletion of the reserves.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of extra-budgetary spendings, National Planning
Minister Rasheed Gbadamosi said, "there are priority economic
projects which the government has to undertake for the benefit of
the people, but no money has been thrown around."
</P>
<P>
On the windfall from the increase in crude oil prices from nine
dollars per barrel projection to 16 dollars, Gbadamosi said the
excess proceeds were yet to accrue to the treasury, adding that
"it takes two-to-three months before it will come into the
treasury."
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar had last
weekend made similar defense, saying critics of his administration
have been unfair and that "everything we have done is there for
anybody to see and for who wants to look."

<HEADLINE> Without Followers, Far-Rightist Resigns From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Benny Begin, the son of late
Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin and a staunch opponent of
the Middle East peace process, has decided to resign from public
life, saying he had lost followers to his far-right cause.
</P>
<P>
Begin, leader of the extreme right-wing party National Union,
told Israel Radio Wednesday that he had decided to resign from
the next Knesset (Parliament) and public life because he believed
there would not be enough Knesset members to stop giving up land.
</P>
<P>
Formed ahead of the just-concluded Israeli elections, The
National Union consisted of far-right elements who are advocating
the Greater Land of Israel and strongly against territorial
concession. It won only three seats in the next Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the National Union will be among the two or
three minor parties which will be definitely excluded from any
coalition under prime minister-elect Ehud Barak, who has said he
will seek a broad-based coalition.
</P>
<P>
Sources in Barak's One Israel alliance said that the prime
minister-elect would seek a majority of at least 75 seats in the
Knesset, backed by another 10 from the Arab Knesset members. At
least 15 parties have secured their entrance into the next
Knesset.
</P>
<P>
A geologist, Begin had served since 1988 as a Knesset member
in the Likud. He quit the cabinet of outgoing Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu over the Hebron peace deal in 1997 and left
the Likud bloc late last year over the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
One of the five candidates for prime minister in the
elections, Begin dropped his candidacy one day before Israelis
went to polls Monday, after two other minor candidates bowed out
of the race.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who was defeated by Barak by a sliding majority,
had hoped Begin to stay on the race in order to prevent Barak
from garnering more than 50 percent of the votes in the voting,
thus force a runoff in which Netanyahu believed he would have a
better chance.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Justice Minister Tzahi Hanegbi
apologized to Barak Wednesday over his allegations that the
former chief of staff abandoned injured soldiers in a training
accident seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
Hanegbi said he "made a moral mistake" by failing to express
regrets over his allegations after an investigation exonerated
Barak two months ago.
</P>
<P>
But Hanegbi denied his apology was prompted by political
motives, saying that he had disqualified himself from any post in
a coalition government which would possibly include Likud.
</P>
<P>
One of the two major parties in Israel, Likud lost almost half
of its seats in the Knesset election, reducing from 32 in the
outgoing Knesset to 19 in the coming one. But sources said Barak
might form a coalition including Likud since Netanyahu has
resigned from its leadership.

<HEADLINE> 30 Million Share-croppers in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- At least 12.5 million people in
Bangladesh have no land of their own and around 30 million people
are totally dependent on the share-cropping system in the South
Asian country.
</P>
<P>
The figures were revealed in a survey report on share-cropping
in Bangladesh, the official BSS news agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The share-croppers had no alternative but to live on
share-cropping despite all adversities including wanton
exploitation of the land-owners, according to the three economists
who conducted the field survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey was sponsored by the Association for Land Reform and
Development (ALRD) and was conducted on the basis of farming
system, nature, and its difference in various regions. Five
villages of five districts were brought under the survey.
</P>
<P>
According to the research findings, landless people and
share-croppers represented 37.2 and 11.1 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that the share-croppers spending their
own money for various inputs were getting only half of the
produce.
</P>
<P>
In case of high-yielding irrigational crops, the share-croppers
had to bear the cost of seed-bed preparation, irrigation and
insecticide, and 68 percent of them could get only half of the
harvest, while the remaining 32 percent were a bit luckier to get
67 percent of the produce, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The survey report said there was seldom any written agreement
between the share-croppers and the land-owners since "verbal pact
was playing the leading role in this regard."
</P>
<P>
Share-coppers in the survey areas informed the researchers that
inputs were dearer than land as they themselves had to pay for the
fertilizer, insecticides and other supports for a good harvest.
</P>
<P>
Such total dependence on agri-inputs at their own cost did not
enable them to get any help from the non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) or banks, since they were neither recognized
farmers nor land-owners, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The researchers in the survey report made some recommendations
including total agrarian reform with the main focus on "lands for
farmers" and per-head ceiling of land.
</P>
<P>
"Measures should be undertaken in a way that helps
share-croppers reap a good harvest at the cost of their labor as
well as money," the report said. The researchers also suggested
providing various agri-inputs at lower prices to the
share-croppers considering their social position.
</P>
<P>
The researchers urged the government and NGOs to provide credit
to share-croppers on easy terms and ensure a 2:1 share system,
meaning two-thirds of the total harvest for share-croppers and
one-third for land-owners in this system of farming.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Congratulates Stepashin on Duma's Confirmation as New PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
congratulated Sergei Stepashin Wednesday shortly after the State
Duma confirmed him as the country's new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
According to final results of the count released by the lower
house of parliament, 297 members voted in favor of the appointment,
while 55 voted against with 11 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has signed a decree officially naming Stepashin as the
new premier.
</P>
<P>
Meeting Stepashin in the Kremlin, Yeltsin expressed
satisfaction with the results of the voting, believed to be a
fresh victory for the president following last Saturday's failure
in the State Duma to start impeachment proceedings against Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin, 47, formerly a first deputy prime minister and
interior minister, was nominated premier on May 12 following the
dismissal of the cabinet of Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
During the brief hearing at the State Duma before the
confirmation vote, Stepashin urged lawmakers to confirm him as
prime minister, warning that Russia needs urgent and courageous
policies to rescue its battered economy and tide over social
unrest.
</P>
<P>
"There is no room for half-measures and compromises any longer,
" he said. "Time demands courageous and thoroughly verified steps.
"
</P>
<P>
Stepashin also urged the Duma deputies to approve a package of
economic bills required for a new loan from the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to maintain the stability that the previous
government had achieved and create a new economic atmosphere that
would facilitate a high living standard for the Russian people and
revitalization of the country.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin stressed that his government will give more
importance to the military-industrial complex and plans to
increase defense spending to 3.5 percent of the gross national
product (GDP) from the current 2.8 percent, taking into
consideration the lessons from the Yugoslav crisis.

<HEADLINE> Feature: NATO Bombings in Eye of World War II Albanian Guerrilla </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- "The NATO bombing of Yugoslavia is
wrong and we are firmly opposed to it. NATO should halt air
strikes immediately," an old Albanian man said, his voice shaking
with anger.
</P>
<P>
The old man seated us and introduced himself as Fajk after we
walked into his tyre-repairing shop in Skopje, capital of
Macedonia, four days ago.
</P>
<P>
Lighting up a cigarette, the 75-year-old Fajk said that at the
age of 17, he joined the anti-fascist guerrilla army led by Tito
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
On learning that we were Chinese journalists, he said that he
was very sorry and angry at NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy
and killing of three Chinese journalists in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"The reporters wrote news stories with their pens and they did
not fight NATO with guns. Why did NATO kill them with missiles?"
he asked, in condemnation.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to a Macedonian-language newspaper on the table
before him and said angrily: "NATO killed about 100 Albanian
refugees in the Korisa village yesterday, including some pregnant
women and children. It is too barbaric a crime."
</P>
<P>
"If the air strikes continue, God knows how many more people
will be killed by NATO. NATO must stop bombing at once, " the old
anti-fascist fighter demanded.
</P>
<P>
He told us that he listened to radio and read newspapers every
day to follow the situation in Kosovo, a Serbian province of
Yugoslavia.

"I moved to Skopje from Pristina in 1950s. At that time,
Albanians, Serbs and other brotherly ethnic groups in Yugoslavia
were united and worked together to build the country and lived in
harmony," he recalled the good years under the leadership of Tito,
the late leader of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"They should try to solve the problem through talks. Why are
they bombarding Yugoslavia and killing the innocent people? --
Many Albanians in Macedonia are against the NATO air strikes," the
old man said.

<P>
"How nice it will be if the (Kosovo) war stops to let us return
to the happy years," he said, his eyes brightened with hope.

<HEADLINE> China Wants Fair, Thorough Inquiry Into NATO Bombing of Chinese Embassy: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Lu
Shulin Wednesday demanded "a fair and thorough investigation" into
the U.S.-led NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador also reiterated the demand for "an immediate
halt to NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
"We want a fair, complete and thorough investigation into
NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade which was an
undisguised assault on China's sovereignty," Lu told the media
here Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
China, he said, also demands a "prompt publication" of the
details of the investigation and severe punishment to those who
are responsible for this barbarian act.
</P>
<P>
The NATO bombing has not solved the issue but "has made it more
complicated instead," Lu noted.
</P>
<P>
"It is time to end such a war. Only through diplomatic efforts
of the international community, can the Kosovo issue be solved in
a proper and just way," the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that no political solution can be discussed in the
United Nations when the NATO bombing is continuing.
</P>
<P>
Lu pointed out that the NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy was
deliberate. NATO's explanation on the "grave incident" that it
happened due to the use of a three-year-old map, holds no logic,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Lu also said the NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia "are not
motivated by any feelings of sympathy for the Albanian Muslims as
their opposition to Muslims all over the world is well known."
</P>
<P>
In response to a question, the envoy said, the "ulterior motive
behind the NATO's action seems to be to wipe out all obstacles in
the way of its Eastward expansion."
</P>
<P>
He said the NATO action will set a "very dangerous precedent in
the next century - a military block will interfere in the affairs
of a country under any pretext.'
</P>
<P>
Lu said, a diplomatic mission, such as the Chinese embassy in
Yugoslavia, is a symbol of a nation's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S.-led NATO's barbaric attack triggered strong
resentment, widespread protests among the 1.2 billion Chinese and
opposition to and condemnation of NATO both in and outside China,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S.-led NATO must bear all responsibilities arising
therefrom and make thorough answers to requests issued by the
Chinese government. The Chinese people cannot accept anything else
short of that," the envoy reiterated.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government is paying close attention to the
developments in this matter, and continues to reserve the right to
take further actions," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Abubakar, "Mother of New Nigeria" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAOS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- In less than two weeks time, Nigeria
would be ushered into a new world of democracy where state power
resides not with a clique of military rulers but with
democratically-elected civil servants.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the handing-over of state powers, the out-going
military ruler, Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalami
Abubakar, has been commended as "the mother of a new Nigeria" in
the most populous African country.
</P>
<P>
About 11 months ago when General Abubakar assumed office
following the sudden death of his predecessor General Sani
Abacha, it was unimaginable that he could have completed his
transition program in May this year.
</P>
<P>
When the head of state announced on July 20 last year the
transition program beginning from September 1998 to may 29 this
year, there were much scepticisms over the genuineness and
sincerity of General Abubakar to hand over power.
</P>
<P>
With the experiences of the two unfulfilled transitions in 13
years by former military rulers of Generals lbrahim Babangida and
late Sani Abacha, Nigerians are justified to have doubts over the
transition program made by the military government.
</P>
<P>
However, General Abubakar this time has turned the program
into reality with three elections at local, state and federal
levels successfully conducted.
</P>
<P>
New constitution promulgated and preparations to hand over
power have reached an advanced stage.
</P>
<P>
The faithful implementation of transition program is seen as
the peak of the Abubakar government and the regime could thus be
awarded a pass mark in its democratization efforts.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the Abubakar government had exhibited
 commendable ability to match its pronouncements with deeds.
</P>
<P>
By the time Abubakar came into power last year, the political
 temperature had already reached a boiling point, the world, which
had isolated Nigeria and Nigerians, were witnessing perhaps the
worst period since independence in 1960.
</P>
<P>
When he was appointed the head of state to succeeded the late
General Abacha, Abubakar inherited the worst human rights
situation in the history o the west African country.
</P>
<P>
During the past 11 months, General Abubakar has managed to
improve the human rights situation at home and to forge new
relations with external creditors and western countries like the
United States, Britain, France, Japan and some other countries in
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
By now, the United Nations Committee on Human Rights has given
Nigeria a clean bill concerning the human rights situation and
the Commonwealth of Nations has also expressed its readiness to
accept Nigeria back to its fold.
</P>
<P>
So, Nigerians describe the current transition program, to be
completed on May 29, as one which "lead us out of the abyss of our
national despair."
</P>
<P>
In the political front, analysts said, Abubakar has performed
above average, but the performance in the economic front has been
less than satisfactory as one analyst put it that " things are
now worse than before

Abubakar took over."
</P>
<P>
Inflation has maintained an upward movement after two years of
steady decline while foreign exchange reserves dropped from seven
billion U.S. dollars in December last year to 3.1 billion dollars
in March.
</P>
<P>
The persistent power failure and fuel crisis all over the
country have slowed down business activity, and government
over-spendings resulted in a 38 billion Naira (about 400 million
dollars) deficit in the first Quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
It is, therefore, certain that the in-coming Nigerian
government would inherit a very sick economy from the out-going
military rulers.
</P>
<P>
A status report compiled by local newspaper, This Day,
described the performance of the Abubakar regime during the past
11 months as follows: "restoring democracy and external relations,
excellent; human rights and economy, poor."
</P>
<P>
Analysts here conclude that if the transition keeps the date
with May 29, it shall, like a religious ordinance, be referred to
as the "spiritual life spring and the mother of a new Nigeria."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Political Parties Called to Abide by Rules of Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Election Committee
(PPI) Wednesday urged all political parties contesting the June 7
general election in the country to abide by the rules of the game
as the campaign will be a political education for the people.
</P>
<P>
"During the past 32 years, we never had a real electoral
campaign. The past campaigns were merely a mass mobilization
instead of political education," PPI Deputy Chairman Hasballah M.
Saad said.
</P>
<P>
The parties should conduct qualified campaigns, rather than
only a mass gathering, he said at his office when commenting on
the election campaign which just began Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On fears over violence during the campaign, he said party
leaders and security officials will take responsibility for
security matters.
</P>
<P>
Campaigning for the country's first post-Soeharto election
kicked off officially Wednesday with a city-wide parade of 48
parties and the official raising of their flags at 108 spots
throughout Jakarta, capital of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile a member of the General Election Monitoring
Committee, Dadang Hawari, warned electoral contestants to abide by
the regulations. The committee will take stern measures to parties
which violate the rules, including ban from campaigning.
</P>
<P>
The 17-day campaign period has been divided into three rounds
lasting five days each. Campaigning will begin on May 20 and each
day of the campaigning will feature either nine or ten parties.
</P>
<P>
Across the country, about 120 million voters are able to take
part in the June 7 polls, electing 462 members to the 500-seat
House of Representatives (DPR). The remaining 38 seats will be
reserved for the Armed Forces which do not vote.
</P>
<P>
PPI Chairman Jacob Tobing told reporters that basically the
first day of election campaign was going on smoothly, but when the
parade started an angry mob attacked three decorated vehicles used
by the ruling Golkar Party at about 11:30 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
A number of on-duty police officers were not able to calm down
the angry mob who continuously damaged the Golkar ornaments and
symbols, and looted the sweets.
</P>
<P>
However, they finally stopped their action and let the police
and drivers move the vehicles out of the street of National
Monument Square to allow other party vehicles to continue the
parade.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has agreed to
grant a loan of 117 million U.S. dollars to improve the water
services in Tanzania' s capital of Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister for Water Mussa Nkhangaa was quoted
Wednesday by local media as saying that the money will be used to
expand and improve the dilapidated water system from River Ruvu
and buy 100,000 water meters for household users.
</P>
<P>
Nkhangaa told a press conference Tuesday that his ministry will
also use the fund to buy equipment to detect illegal connections
which cause poor water supply in the city.
</P>
<P>
Inhabited by more than three million people, Dar es Salaam is
currently getting only 60 million gallons of water a day while
the demand is 90 million gallons.
</P>
<P>
"It is losing 30 to 45 percent of the water pumped at the Ruvu
River because of worn-out pipelines and illegal connections," the
minister explained.
</P>
<P>
Nkhangaa also said the ministry is looking into the possibility
of constructing a big dam or two small ones for storing water
from the Ruvu River which would be used in case of dry weather or
drought.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Customs Officers Stop Dangerous Insects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese quarantine officers said
today that some insects that were discovered by Nanhai Customs
officers in Guangdong Province have been identified as dangerous
Mediterranean fruit flies.
</P>
<P>
The insects were found among some Egyptian oranges carried by a
Hong Kong traveler. They are the most dangerous fruit and
vegetable insects. This is the fifth time Guangdong customs
officers have found some of the insects since 1993 and the tenth
time in China.
</P>
<P>
The Mediterranean fruit fly can cause damage to as many as 260
varieties of fruits and other plants and has a history of causing
great damage in more than 90 countries. China has not been plagued
by the insect so far but it is classified by customs officials as
the most dangerous insect because of its adaptability, strong
reproductive capacity, and the severe damage it can cause.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Culture Minister to Step Down From Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Culture, Arts and
Tourism Minister Sabbaruddin Chik Wednesday confirmed that he will
step down from his cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
He said Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad had asked him to do so
at Wednesday's cabinet weekly meeting.
</P>
<P>
"In politics, stepping down is normal... we can also be
removed. This is normal and the normal way. When we're asked to
quit, we quit. It's only that I'm not saying I'm quitting because
I'm sick," he told reporters at his office here.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the press speculated about him stepping down because
of poor health due to his kidney ailment.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot accept that I'm stepping down because of poor health.
You look at me whether I'm ill or not," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sabbaruddin said that the prime minister need not state the
reasons for wanting him to step down because this was the prime
minister's prerogative and there was no need to question it.
</P>
<P>
"I have no problem in leaving the cabinet. It's up to the prime
minister. There's no questioning why he wanted me to quit. We
can't have such an attitude in the party," he added.

<HEADLINE> More New Capital Inflows After Exit Tax Introduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The change in the selective
capital control measures towards the use of "exit tax" in the form
of repatriation levy has encouraged fresh flow of funds into
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
A total of 6,000 new accounts were established for new capital
which came in after February 15, 1999, the National Economic
Action Council (NEAC) said in a statement here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On May 12, the total net new inflow amounted to 1.436 billion
ringgit (388 million U.S. dollars) compared to a net inflow of
18.5 million ringgit (4.87 million dollars) on March 10 this year
</P>
<P>
This indicated the return of confidence in the Kuala Lumpur
Stock Exchange (KLSE) which has performed remarkably since
September 1, 1998, the NEAC said.
</P>
<P>
The KLSE Composite Index closed Tuesday at 780.29 points
against 262 points on September 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, market capitalization has increased to 489.25
billion ringgit (128.75 billion dollars) on May 18, 1999 from

<HEADLINE> Chinese Analysts Say Ethnic Minority Regions Need Science And Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A group of analysts said recently
that the development gap between ethnic minority regions in
central and western parts of China and the more prosperous eastern
parts has continued to grow in recent years and that China needs a
new strategy to speed up that development.
</P>
<P>
In the latest National Conditions Report of the Chinese Academy
of Sciences's National Conditions Analysis and Research Group they
pointed out that that the major problems are stability and
development and the solution is science and education.
</P>
<P>
Rapid population growth and low levels of education are the
main reasons for lack of development, they say. The latest census
shows that ethnic minority populations growing by 39.5 per 1,000
annually between 1982 and 1990, or 2.6 times the national average.
From 1990 to 1995, the rate was 40.3 per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
But, cultural levels remain low, with illiteracy rates of 30.8
percent, or 9.3 percentage points higher than among the Han.
</P>
<P>
The report says that other reasons for the lack of development
are bad transport conditions, backward infrastructure, a single
economic structure, and inability to attract overseas investment.
It emphasizes the close connection between science and education
and the economy.
</P>
<P>
It also says that technology should be brought in and that
scientific and technological advantages should be made full use of.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean President to Meet Rebel Leader in Togo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah of
Sierra Leone is visiting Togo where he is expected to meet rebel
leader Foday Sankoh in a bid to end the 8-year civil war in the
country.
</P>
<P>
President Kabbah and U.S. human rights activist Jesse Jackson
arrived in Lome, capital of Togo, Tuesday for direct peace talks
between the Kabbah government and the rebels, according to a
Nigerian Tribune report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah and Jackson were met at the airport by Togolese
President Gnassingbe Eyadema, current chairman of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS), who is brokering peace
talks in the West African country of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the Togolese president said that by
mid-morning, Jackson was holding talks with rebel leader Sankoh
who has been in Lome for a month holding international discussions
with his followers of the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF).
</P>
<P>
Jackson later went to Accra, capital of Ghana, where the
week-long Fifth African/African-American Summit is being held.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah was expected to have consultations with President
Eyadema although it is not excluded that Kabbah and Sankoh would
meet face-to-face at a later time.
</P>
<P>
Last week, an RUF delegation presented its peace proposals to
ECOWAS and the United Nations in anticipation of full-fledged
negotiations between the Kabbah government and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Sierra leonean government and the rebels agreed Tuesday a
ceasefire that will begin next Monday and to start peace talks the
following day, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also agreed to immediately release all prisoners of
war and give humanitarian workers free access to the entire
country.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, both Kabbah and Sankoh agreed to ask
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to send observers to
Sierra Leone to ensure both sides meet the terms of the agreement.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- One of the newly elected Israeli
Prime Minister's first trips may be to China, at least that's what
he hopes, Israeli Ambassador Ora Namir told local media today.
</P>
<P>
She commented on Monday's election, in which "One Israel"
leader Ehud Barak defeated Prime Minister and Likud Leader
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Relationship between Israel and China are excellent and Barak
places a great deal of importance on the bilateral ties, she said
and added that Barak was very confident about winning. She also
spoke about the future political and economic situation in Israel.
</P>
<P>
One Israel, which won 27 seats in the Knesset, the Israeli
parliament, could form a coalescent government with Likud's 19
seats and other parties supporting the peace process, which is
Barak's major task, she said and pointed out that Barak's
commitment to follow the peace process of the late prime minister
Yitzhak Rabin won him the trust of the Israeli people, who want
peace and security so much.
</P>
<P>
Peace in the Middle East will be Israel's greatest contribution
to world peace, she said. The most significant initiative of the
new government in developing the economy is to invest in education
as much as it can.
</P>
<P>
She said she believes that peace in the region will make
investors more confident and that will create more work
opportunities and reduce un-employment.

CAIRO, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs

<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Kuwait imports mineral water from 24
countries, of which 85 percent comes from the Gulf Arab states,
according to a study released here Tuesday by the Ministry of
Water and Electricity.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Center for Developing Water Resources at
the ministry, Khalifa Al-Furaij, said the study showed that
all imported water in the country matches the measures and
specifications of the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
But the study failed to give the exact figure of water
Kuwait imports from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Although Kuwait, a small Gulf desert state, supplies residents
with adequate desalinated sea water, people still tend to buy
imported mineral water for drinking and cooking ends.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- Cyprus and Britain signed a memorandum on air
transport in a bid to further develop air transport between the
two countries, local newspapers reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The document grants permissions to a British company to fly
from Stansted airport and increase the number of seat-only
passengers on charter flights.
</P>
<P>
It also provides for the transport of fruit and vegetables on
charter flights to all British airports.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Kuwait and Germany Tuesday extended an
agreement to avoid double taxation in either country, said a
press release issued by the German Embassy here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The deal, which was signed by German Ambassador in Kuwait
Werner H. Krebs and Kuwaiti Undersecretary of Finance Abdul
Mohsen Yousef Al-Hneif, "shall become effective with unlimited
duration as of January 1, 1998," the news release said.
</P>
<P>
The previous agreement expired on December 31, 1997, it
added.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- The Arab Fund for Economic and Social
Development (AFESD) has agreed to extend some 66 million
U.S. dollars in loans to Bahrain for the country's housing
project, a statement issued by the AFESD said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The project, which consists of 1,425 housing units, aims
to offer houses and suitable services to the Bahraini people,
Kuwait News Agency cited the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
The annual interest rate for the 22-year loan was set at 4.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The total participation of the Arab fund in Bahraini projects
is estimated at around 547 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> China Expecting 8.2 Percent Growth For First Half Of Year (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- China is expecting 8.2 percent
economic growth for the first half of this year with a GDP of 3.66
trillion yuan (442 billion U.S. dollars), the State Information
Center (SIC) says.
</P>
<P>
In a report in Wednesday's China Securities daily, the SIC said
that the prediction was based on an analysis of the government's
macro-economic policies and the general economic development
trends.
</P>
<P>
Primary industry, which includes agriculture, forestry, animal
husbandry, fisheries, and water conservation, will remain stable
with 3.5 percent growth in the first half, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Industrial added value will increase by 9.7 percent to 940
billion yuan, light industry will grow by 9.5 percent, and heavy
industry by 9.9 percent, faster growth than for last year.
</P>
<P>
Greater fixed assets spending by the government will boost
growth in the construction sector to 10 percent on an annual basis,
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
The service sector will have slow but continued growth,
considering sluggish domestic consumer spending and a bearish
stock market in the wake of the Asian financial crisis. For these
reasons, economists predict 7.2 percent growth, more or less the
same as for 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
The period will also see slow growth in foreign trade and a
decline in the trade surplus. Economists predict that foreign
trade will be worth 153.3 billion U.S. dollars, with a trade
surplus worth 15.5 billion U.S. dollars, 7 billion dollars less
than for the same last year period.
</P>
<P>
The report says that market prices will continue to edge down,
but that the large increase in fixed assets spending will
gradually take effect, reversing the downward trend in prices.
</P>
<P>
The retail price index is expected to drop by 2.8 percent for
the period, while the consumer price index will be down 1.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
The monetary policy will be important in the second quarter. In
the first half of the year, the M2, or broad money, will reach 11.
2 trillion yuan, up 18.5 percent, and the M1, or narrow money,
will reach 3.884 trillion yuan, up 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report suggests that the central government take steps to
boost economic development, like continuing proactive financial
and monetary policies and further interest cuts to find effective
ways to increase exports and consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
It also warned that there will be lower economic growth in the
second half and that the government should pay a great deal of
attention to this.

<P>
COPENHAGEN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Men's doubles top seeds Danny
Kantono and Budi Ariantho of Indonesia were crashed out of the
World Badminton Championships in the first round here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian duo, top ranked players in the world, lost to
Chinese underdogs Yu Jinhao and Chen Qiqiu 15-17, 15-3, 15-13.
</P>
<P>
It is the first victory for China in the men's doubles against
their Indonesian rivals in 12 months.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Liu Xinmin was more than happy for the win. He
said:"It is a revenge for us to win the match."
</P>
<P>
Yu Jinhao was full of confidence going into the match. "I have
prepared for the victory," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, his partner Chen Qiqiu was, to some extent, in awe of
the Indonesian counterparts. "The victory is like a dream to me.
Just when we were at 14-13 lead in the third set, I had the mind
that we might win the match."
</P>
<P>
Indonesian team head coach Christian Hadinata said wrong
strategy caused the defeat to his players. "When our players were
at 8-1 in the third set, they should have played with tactics as
in the first set, but with too many lobs, they made many unforced
errors in the match," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The refugees' situation in Macedonia
has been highly alarming, Macedonian Foreign Minister Aleksandar
Dimitrov said Tuesday in Skopje, capital of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Dimitrov said at a routine press briefing that a new influx of
Kosovo refugees is expected in the neighboring country of
Yugoslavia as NATO bombardment on Kosovo, a Serbia Republic
province, has been intensified over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the Macedonian news agency MIA as saying that
Macedonia has received 23,000 tons of relief materials and 25
million U.S. dollars in assistance for the budget.
</P>
<P>
To accommodate and feed the 230,000 Kosovo refugees who have
come to Macedonia, 850,000 dollars are spent each day, the
Macedonian foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Macedonia hopes the EU assistance of 25 million
euros (about 27.5 million U.S. dollars) will arrive soon.
</P>
<P>
Macedonian Trade Minister Nikola Gruevski said the Kosovo war
has so far caused an economic loss of 680 million dollars to
Macedonia.

<P>
CANBERRA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket drifted
lower Wednesday with resource stocks among the hardest hit.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index surrendered 18.4 points, or 0.6
percent, to 2981.2 by the close.
</P>
<P>
But the all resources index lost 19.3 points, or 1.6 percent,
to finish at 1200.7. The all industrials index had a comparatively
better loss of 22.3 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5221.2.
</P>
<P>
Brokers described the day's trade as cautious overall, as the
market was still assessing the likely local impact of the U.S.
central bank's move to favor raising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
On the Australian Stock Exchange, market volume was 519.6
million stocks valued at 939.46 million U.S. dollars, with falling
stocks outpacing rising stocks 782 to 535, with 451 stocks trading
steady.
</P>
<P>
Resource stocks were hardest hit by the news as a rise in
interest rates in the U.S. could lead to a slowing in the economy
there and hence an end to rising U.S. consumption of resources.

<P>
Resources giant BHP suffered a 15.3 cent loss to 17.15
Australian dollars, global miner Rio Tinto gave up 41.8 cents to
23.285 Australian dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- There will be a smooth transfer of
power in Macao as long as China and Portugal work together and
adhere to the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration and consider
Macao's actual conditions, according to Chinese Foreign Minister
Tang Jiaxuan.
</P>
<P>
In talks with Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama here today,
Tang said that the two sides have solved some problems through
consultations since the Joint Declaration was signed in 1987 and
that bilateral cooperation has been effective. He said that he
hopes the two will further cooperate to settle the remaining
transition problems.

will grow during this period.
</P>

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Keep Current Macro-economic Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mbeki, also the ANC chief, told a business seminar Tuesday that
the ANC' s polices of the Reconstruction and Development Program
(RDP) and the Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR)
macro-economic package were appropriate for its second five-year
term of office.
</P>
<P>
The ANC began ruling South Africa after the abolition of
apartheid in 1994. After its five-year reign, the biggest black
political party in the country, is due to participate in the June
2 all-race election, the second of its kind since the birth of
democratic South Africa.
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed that the ANC will absolutely win in
the election, and that Mbeki will succeed President Nelson Mandela
as new head of state after the election.
</P>
<P>
Defending the ANC's economic policy, Mbeki said that both the
RDP and the GEAR, as a broad policy framework, would remain
relevant, and the next ANC-led government will continue to be
bound by it.
</P>
<P>
The GEAR, which is characterized by tight fiscal discipline and
a reduction in the budget deficit, was introduced in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
At the Presidential Jobs Summit last October, the union
movement said it remained opposed to GEAR, while opposition
parties have argued that GEAR has never been fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
In his latest policy speech, Mbeki also said the ANC had no
plans to use a two-thirds parliamentary majority to alter the
constitution to curtail the powers of provincial government or to
restrict the independence of the Reserve Bank.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, he would seek better coordination between the
Reserve bank, the Ministry of Finance and the government.

<HEADLINE> Bold to Learn From Foreign Experience: China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), made the
remarks at a meeting with Qaboos Bin Said, the Sultan of Oman, on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Li is on a four-day official visit to Oman, the first by the
leader of China's top advisory institution and the third leg of
his four-country tour to Asia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
Only through learning from all foreign advanced experience and
civilization can China speed up its development, Li said, adding
that Any country, if it secludes itself from the rest of the
world, it can in no way follow the development trend of the world.
</P>
<P>
Li describes Oman as one of the earliest countries in the world
to engage in economic and cultural exchanges with China, citing
the "Silk Road" which linked China and Oman some 13 centuries
ago. The sea route pioneered by the Suhar ship from Oman has since
witnessed frequent exchanges between the two peoples. And all this
was done at difficult conditions. Today, there are more favorable
communications and transportation conditions, "we should all the
more carry forward the traditions of our ascendants to open a new
chapter in Sino-Oman relations," Li stated.
</P>
<P>
Li also handed over a letter from Chinese President Jiang Zemin
to Qaboos, which deals with ways of bostering bilateral relations
and strengthening cooperation in international issues of common
interest. Li briefed Qaboos on China's commitment to enhance its
traditional friendship with Oman. China has always attached
importance to developing the mutually beneficial cooperative ties
with Oman, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Qaboos, who is concurrently the prime minister, said he was
satisfied with the development of the bilateral relations,
particularly the exchanges and cooperation in political, economic
and cultural fields. The Omani Sultan highly valued China's
achievements over the past 20 years, saying China is a country
with extreme importance in the world and China should play its due
role internationally to benefit the people the world over.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Crown Prince to Visit S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia's crown prince,
Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, will visit South Africa Thursday,
South African Foreign Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The crown prince will be accompanied by a high-level delegation
which includes the ministers of foreign affairs, petroleum and
minerals, industry and electricity as well as finance and national
economy.
</P>
<P>
During his five-day visit, the crown prince is scheduled to
have talks with South African President Nelson Mandela and Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki, the ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
High-level talks between ministers of the two sides have also
been arranged.
</P>
<P>
Several bilateral agreements are expected to be signed during
the visit, including an agreement on economic, trade, investment
and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the agreement will provide the framework for
future cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It said relations between the two countries have improved
significantly since the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"This is evidenced by the number of high-level visits exchanged
between the two countries, as well as increased contact in the
field of trade and investment."
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that both Mandela and Mbeki have visited
Saudi Arabia on more than one occasion while several members of
the Saudi royal family and members of the Council of Ministers
have been to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The two countries played a pivotal role in resolving the
Lockerbie bombing impasse.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is currently the second biggest market for South
African products in the Arab world with bilateral trade totalling
2.5 billion rand (410 million U.S. dollars) during the first
eleven months of 1998. This is a significant increase on total
trade of 1.9 billion rand (310 million dollars) during the same
period in 1997, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Saudi Arabia is becoming increasingly important as a source of
crude oil and is presently the third largest supplier of this
commodity to the republic."
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia also had a plan to buy a huge amount of arms from
South Africa. The plan had to be postponed because of financial
problems in the country.

<HEADLINE> S. African Prisons Overcrowded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Prison population in South
Africa are now at their highest ever, Sowetan newspaper quoted an
official release as reporting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Official figures reveal that the prisons in South Africa, which
can accommodate up to 95,000 convicts, are holding nearly 155,000
prisoners behind bars.
</P>
<P>
The overcrowding may result in the Department of Correctional
Services releasing up to 6,000 prisoners in the next few months,
Sowetan quoted an unidentified official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Russel Mamabolo, spokesman for the department, admitted earlier
that the biggest single challenge facing prison authorities was
prison overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
Mamabolo said that overcrowded conditions had a "detrimental
effect on convicts both physically and emotionally".
</P>
<P>
He said since 1996 certain offenders had been allowed to serve
their sentences outside prison by electronic monitoring.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000 prisoners are serving their sentences through a
series of alternative programs. These include house arrest,
community service, participation in correctional programs and
victim compensation, which have proved to be highly successful,
Mamabolo said.
</P>
<P>
According to Mamabolo, his department is planning to build two
more prisons later this year.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Realizing that it will be impossible for the
department to provide sufficient prison accommodation in the short
term, we have decided to embark on a policy of involving the
private sector in the building of new prisons."

<HEADLINE> Officials Found Guilty Of Misappropriation Of Flood Relief Materials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Four officials in east China's
Jiangxi Province on Tuesday received various prison terms for
misappropriating donations intended for the victims of last
summer's flooding.
</P>
<P>
The Intermediate People's Court of Nanchang, the capital of
Jiangxi, found Xu Bingrong, the head of a civil affairs office in
Xinjian County, guilty of taking flood relief materials worth over
200,000 yuan (about 25,000 U.S. dollars) and selling them to a
local businessman. The materials, which included mineral water,
shirts, fertilizer, stationery, food, and medicines, were given to
Xinjian County by the Civil Affairs Ministry in September.
</P>
<P>
The court also found Guo Guogan, the deputy director of the
Xinjian County Civil Affairs Department, and two other department
officials guilty of misappropriating food, sugar, and other relief
materials worth 5,877 yuan last September.
</P>
<P>
The cases are extremely serious because all the accused were
government officials and the State had repeatedly order officials
to keep their hands off any relief materials, one court official
says.
</P>
<P>
Xu was given life in prison, Guo was given 8 years, and the 2
others each got a year in jail.
</P>
<P>
Xiong Sanxiang, the private businessman who bought the
materials from Xu, was also convicted of trafficking in stolen
goods and got 2 years and 6 months in jail.
</P>
<P>
Last year's devastating floods were said to be the worst in
decades. They swept the entire Yangtze River basin and parts of
the northeast China from July to September, killing more than 3,
000 people and causing damage worth some 200 billion yuan.
Domestic and overseas donations worth billions of yuan were
collected for the flood relief endeavor.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Businessmen Call for Regional Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Zambian businessmen are pressing for
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) trade protocol
whose arrangement will help them gain access to the South African
market.
</P>
<P>
In its publication businessline, the Zambia Association of
Chambers of Commerce and Industry (ZACCI) said South African trade
officials have also intimated their bias to the protocol as
opposed to a Zambia-South African Customs Union (SACU) agreement,
Times of Zambia newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The SACU agreement is still before cabinet while the SADC trade
protocol, which is said to be "all embracing", will become
effective on January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that South Africa would be making a
comprehensive offer to other non-SACU members of SADC at the next
SADC trade negotiation forum scheduled to be held next month in
Lusaka, Zambia's capital.
</P>
<P>
The publication warns that South African exports would dwindle
if that country did not open its market to non-SACU members of
SADC. This scenario will be caused by the lack of sufficient
foreign exchange to sustain further imports of South African
goods.
</P>
<P>
Last year, South Africa exported goods worth 3.4 billion U.S.
dollars to SADC countries while its imports from the region were
merely 600 million dollars. South Africa's trade with SADC
countries was only 5-7 percent while 93-95 percent was with the
rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, SADC accounted for only two percent of South Africa's
total import, a situation which will only be redressed when the
SADC trade protocol comes into force.
</P>
<P>
"The coming into force of the SADC trade protocol should be a
welcome development for Zambia because we have spent the last five
years fighting for South African and SACU market access,"
businessline said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Inflation Continues to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's annualized
consumer inflation continues to fall, edging down to 7.7 percent
in April from 7.9 percent in March, Statistics South Africa
figures showed.
</P>
<P>
The decline of inflation, for the fifth consecutive month now,
was mainly due to the continued easing of monetary policy after
the major currency crisis last year.
</P>
<P>
The prime lending rate, which once was as high as 25.5 percent
last year, now stands at 19 percent. It is estimated that the rate
would be further reduced to 16 percent at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics South Africa figures released Tuesday showed that
there was also a decline in the core inflation rate, which
measures underlying inflation by excluding costs such as mortgage
rates, taxes and volatile food stuffs.
</P>
<P>
The core inflation fell to 7.7 percent in April from 8.0
percent in March, despite a sizeable month-on-month increase of
1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Headline inflation, which reflects consumers' monthly costs, is
of less importance for the South African Reserve Bank's monetary
policy purposes than core inflation, which provides an indication
of demand pressures on inflation.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fall in inflation, analysts warned that the sharp
increase in fuel prices could interrupt the downward trend unless
there are further interest rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
Petrol prices jumped by about three U.S. cents per liter at the
 beginning of the month and is expected to rise again as oil
prices go up on the international market.

<HEADLINE> Edible Wild Herbs Becoming Popular In China </HEADLINE>

<P>
JINAN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Edible wild herbs, which used to be
eaten only by poor people in the past, have become a favorite of
many Chinese in recent years.
</P>
<P>
At markets in Jinan, the capital of east China's Shandong
Province, edible wild herbs do well because people prefer using
them in dumplings and some other typical local dishes.
</P>
<P>
In Hebei Province, the city of Chengde produces some 9,000 tons
of wild herbs each year, 50 percent of which are sold to hotels
and restaurants across the country.
</P>
<P>
A cookbook, The Cooking of Taishan Edible Wild Plants, was
published recently in Shandong. According to the author, Zhu
Zhenglun, edible wild herbs are mostly pollution-free and some
have a curative effect. The Chinese are also paying more attention
to their health as the standard of living improves, Zhu says.

<HEADLINE> HK Govt to Seek NPC Help in Right of Abode Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The decision was announced by the government when it tabled the
solution at the Legislative Council House Committee special
meeting and informed the committee members of the request Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), said: "Having given careful
consideration to learned legal opinion, we have chosen to seek
interpretation because we wish to establish the true legislative
intent behind the Basic Law provisions."
</P>
<P>
"This is the most appropriate and effective manner of dealing
with this issue," he said at a press conference Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to the ruling by the Court of Final Appeal on January
29, a total of 1.67 million mainland residents could be eligible
to live in Hong Kong as permanent residents.
</P>
<P>
The government estimated that the cost of accommodating the
mainland residents could reach 710 billion HK dollars (91.02
billion U.S. dollars) over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Tung said: "What we face is a problem of unplanned population
growth which Hong Kong, as a society, will not be able to bear."
</P>
<P>
"Apart from financial burdens, we face a scenario of possible
declining living standards. Hong Kong simply in any case does not
have the land to accommodate the additional influx of people", he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Today we have taken a very difficult decision. Whether
considering our immediate challenge or long-term development, or
whether we are acting to protect the interests of individuals in
Hong Kong or the society as a whole, this decision, in my view,
was necessary and was correct," he added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the Central Government and the NPC
Standing Committee will appreciate fully the difficulties that
Hong Kong faces and accept the request to interpret Article 22 (4)
and Article 24 (2) (3) of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Administrative Secretary Anson Chan said at the House Committee
meeting that the decision to go to the NPC Standing Committee was
in line with the Basic Law, and would not undermine Hong Kong's
autonomy or the rule of law and judicial independence.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman described the decision as a "legal and
constitutional" option.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Build Big City in Desert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- With investments from oversea
Iranians, Iran is to build a big city in an area of 3,600 square
kilometers in one of the country's biggest deserts, local daily
Neshat (Joy) reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ground will be broken on Monday for the first phase of the
city, named as "Khodashahr" (God's City), which will be built in
Ardestan region of the central province of Isfahan, on the edge
of the Kavir Desert.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the city would be built in 20 kilometers
and 10 kilometers, the designer Dr. Iraj Yazdanbakhsh told the
daily. He called on all oversea Iranians to put their investments
on building the city.
</P>
<P>
The city would be built into a center for Iranian scientists,
intellectuals and other specialists.
</P>
<P>
Iran needs to make use of the desert to provide facilities for
scientists, intellectuals and other specialists, considering the
fact that one third of the Iranian territory is desert, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yazdanbakhsh said that according to the plan, every house
in the city would cover an area of 1,000 square meters,
including 200 square meters for building and 800 square meters
for the green.
</P>
<P>
The houses will be kept within two floors, the 65-year-old
designer said, and the city will be built with bricks and
tiles, even without using irons or cements.
</P>
<P>
Yazdanbakhsh also said that some factories would be
constructed along with technical schools in the city.

<HEADLINE> Indy to Follow F1 and CART with Tethered Wheels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Following the lead of Formula
One and Championship Auto Racing Teams, the Indy Racing League (
IRL) will have tethered wheels on cars running in the 83rd
Indianapolis 500, according to reports from Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
The move follows the deaths of three spectators at an IRL race
May 1 in Charlotte, North Carolina, when a wheel bounced over a
safety fence and into the stands.
</P>
<P>
F1 cars have had wheel tethers to prevent such tragedy since
the start of the season. CART adopted the safety feature a week
ago and will debut the change at a race near St. Louis on May 29,
a day before the Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
IRL operations director Brian Barnhart said a device has been
made but a technical committee is unsure how well it will work.
</P>
<P>
Barnhard said: "We will definitely do something prior to the
race, but the only problem is we don't know what this thing will
really do until after somebody has a crash."
</P>
<P>
He added that "We should have some answers in a few days. This
is an extremely sensitive and complicated issue. But we may be
able to improve driver safety as well as spectator safety."

<P>
SEOUL, May 19 (Xinhua) -- 12 U.S. Air Force F-15E fighters and
some 200 personnel on Wednesday afternoon arrived at Kwangju Air
Base in South Korea, according to a news release of the United
States Forces Korea.
</P>
<P>
The 12 fighters are from the 90th Fighter Squadron from
Elmondorf Air Force Base, Alaska, the United States, will carry
out a variety of training events and activities in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The news release said the deployment of the fighters does not
mean an increase in permanent U.S. capability and personnel in
South Korea, "but does represent the inherent flexibility of U.S.
military forces to deploy rapidly as necessary to meet mission
requirements."
</P>
<P>
"The squadron's development is not related to any recent events
on the Korean Peninsula or any North Korean activity," said the
United States Forces Korea in the news release.
</P>
<P>
Kwangju Air Base, which is located some 160 miles south of
Seoul, is normally used for training by South Korean Air Force and
the U.S. Air Force units on a regular basis.

<P>
MANILA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
confident that the future looks bright for Philippine Airlines
(PAL) now that the flag carrier's immediate financial woes have
been addressed, a government news release said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Edgardo Espiritu, secretary of finance, was quoted as saying
that PAL Chairman Lucio Tan assured President Estrada Tuesday that
he has already raised 100 million U.S. dollars to complete the
fresh capital of 200 million U.S. dollars needed to keep PAL in
business.
</P>
<P>
Tan had earlier placed 100 million U.S. dollars in escrow, the
news release said.
</P>
<P>
"There appears to be no problem now. Most of PAL's creditors
have agreed to PAL's rehabilitation program," Espiritu said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said Tan also informed Estrada that the German airline
Lufthansa will likely manage PAL.
</P>
<P>
"The management issue is clearing up. Professionals will come
in, and Mr. Tan is confident that Lufthansa will manage the
airline," he said.

<HEADLINE> Trial of Rwandan Genocide Suspect Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania failed again
Wednesday to deliver a ruling on the fate of Bernard Ntuyahaga, a
former army officer wanted by both Rwanda and Belgium for his role
in the 1994 Rwanda genocide, because appointment of counsels of
the suspect is not ready.
</P>
<P>
The Kisutu Resident Magistrate's Court in Dar es Salaam, said
during the morning trial that the two counsels demanded by
Ntuyahaga are not available yet.
</P>
<P>
The Principal Resident Magistrate, Projestus Rugazia, said he
will apply to the Chief Justice of the High Court to have somebody
appointed as legal advocates for Ntuyahaga.
</P>
<P>
Rugazia ruled that the case will be mentioned next Wednesday.
It has been the third time for the court to hear the case since it
started last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
With a smile, Ntuyahaga seemed to be relaxed when hearing the
decision. The man, in black western suit, was talking to the court
in French through an interpreter, Baraka Luvanda, who is appointed
by Tanzania's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International
Co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Major Ntuyahaga, the former Head of Logistics at Kigali
military camp in Rwanda, allegedly murdered former Rwandan Prime
Minister Agathe Uwiningiyimana and 10 Belgium U.N. peace-keepers
escorting her in the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
</P>
<P>
The 47-year-old man is wanted by both Rwanda and Belgium for
extradition and trial.
</P>
<P>
Both countries have filed applications requesting the Tanzanian
 government to hand over the accused to their countries for trial.
And the Tanzanian government said that it will abide by court
ruling.
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga was handed to the hand of Tanzania in March this year
after the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) based
in Arusha, created by the United Nations Security Council in north
Tanzania, dropped charges of genocide and crimes against humanity
against him and set him free.
</P>
<P>
The accused, however, was re-arrested shortly after he was
released. The Tanzanian police caught him in the name of illegal
entry into the country as he came into the country without going
through normal immigration procedures.
</P>
<P>
After Wednesday's court session, the State Attorney, Geofrey
Shaidi, told reporters that Tanzania has filed an extradition
application to Rwanda, and Belgium was not considered.
</P>
<P>
Legal sources said Belgium's request was turned down because
the extradition agreement between Tanzania and Belgium does not
allow extraditing the accused into the country other than one in
which the crimes were committed. In addition, the sources said
Rwanda made the extradition request to Tanzania ahead of Belgium.

<HEADLINE> Barak's Victory Shows Desire for Change in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Ehud Barak's victory in Israel's
elections mirrored Israeli people's desire for a change of the
country's policy on the Middle East peace process, Arab League
(AL) chief said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egypt's Voice of Arab radio over telephone
from Beirut, Lebanon, Esmat Abdel-Meguid said the situation in the
Jewish state shows the Israelis' keenness on maintaining the peace
process, which was launched in 1991 in Madrid, Spain.
</P>
<P>
Barak, leader of the Israeli Labor Party, defeated the hardline
incumbent Prime Minister and leader of the Likud Group, Benjamin
Netanyahu, in the country's early elections for a prime minister
and the 120-member Knesset (Parliament) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid blamed Netanyahu and his intransigence in the past
three years for blocking the Mideast peace march, which he said is
in the interests of all peoples in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the league chief called for a thorough follow-up of
what Barak has pledged on the peace process during the election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs and the whole international community would like to
see Barak's deeds other than words, Abdel-Meguid said.
</P>
<P>
Barak has pledged to push the peace process on all tracks
forward if he was elected Israel's next prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks stalled in December due to
Israel's suspension of the Wye peace accord signed last October,
under which Israel should pull back from another 13 percent of the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations between Syria and Lebanon, on the one hand,
and Israel, on the other, came to a halt in early 1996 due to
disputes over the future of the Golan Heights Israel captured from
Syria in the 1967 Mideast War.

<HEADLINE> Open Recruitment of Officials in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region in
southwest China is now recruiting local officials through open
examinations, the first time in the region's history.
</P>
<P>
Open recruitment, which began early this month and will last
through June, is intended to select a number of officials at the
deputy county head level for four Tibetan cities and prefectures,
Lhasa, Qamdo, Xigaze, and Nyingchi.
</P>
<P>
"Those qualified for open recruitment must be under the age of
45, have a college degree or higher diploma, and have at least
five years of work experience in state enterprises or social
institutions," said an official with the Tibet Regional Personnel
Department.
</P>
<P>
The recruiting process includes a written examination of the
participants' general and professional knowledge, and a face-to-
face interview for those who pass the exam, added the official.
</P>
<P>
In the regional capital of Lhasa, 41 young people, including 14
Tibetans, have to date applied to be candidates for this program.
They will vie for three vacancies in the city government, which
include two deputy directors of the science and technology
commission, and a deputy chief of the township enterprises
administration.
</P>
<P>
Nyima Cering, one of the candidates, said that an open and fair
selection of government officials is the result of China's current
bid to adopt a socialist market economy and build a cleaner and
more efficient government.
</P>
<P>
"I'm the son of a former serf, and my father, who was at the
bottom of society in old Tibet, has high expectations for me. I
have confidence that I will be selected," said the 28-year-old
Nyima, a graduate of Tibet University.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Overseas-funded businesses in east
China's Zhejiang Province continue to increase investment this
year, prompted by high returns on their previous investments.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that 98 of the existing overseas-
funded enterprises in the province expanded their investment by a
total of 138 million U.S. dollars during the first quarter of the

<P>
One of these is Terumo Medical Products (Hangzhou) Co., Ltd.,
which was set up by Japan's Terumo in 1997 at a cost of 29.4
million U.S. dollars, and this year raised its total investment to
51.25 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A source with Terumo said the Hangzhou subsidiary has become a

<HEADLINE> Electric Grid Improvement Expected To Increase Rural Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The improvement of rural electric
grids in east China's Jiangxi Province is expected to increase
local demand by as much as 11.4 billion yuan in the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
Because to higher electricity prices in local rural areas,
common household appliances like electric fans, washing machines,
refrigerators, and color TVs are looked upon as luxury items,
beyond the reach of most local farmers.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, there was an average of 106 electric fans for every
100 households in rural areas in the province, 22 washing machines,
8.5 refrigerators, and 27 color TVs.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, improved electric grids in some rural areas
has led to increased use of household appliances.
</P>
<P>
And it is now estimated that the 7.14 million local farmers
will buy about five billion yuan worth of household appliances in
the next five years, including 13 million electric fans, 200,000
washing machines, 600,000 refrigerators, one million color TVs,
and two million electric rice cookers.
</P>
<P>
In addition, electric-grid improvement will give impetus to the
development of such sectors as machinery, metallurgy, building
materials, and electricity generating facilities as well.
</P>
<P>
Over the next two years, the province will invest 4.57 billion
yuan to transform its rural electric grids.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua News Agency today gave a
team of correspondents in Yugoslavia the Collective Merit Award,
First Class, and rewards for their large number of stories and
photos and coverage that exposed the essence of the U.S.-led NATO
aggression and reflected the heroic spirit of the Yugoslavian army
and people in upholding the state sovereignty and the principled
stand of upholding justice of the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Many innocent civilians have been killed or injured during US-

The team includes Xinhua chief Belgrade correspondent Yang
Chengming, and other correspondents Shao Yunhuan, Zhao Jinhe, Yi
Gaochao, Huang Wen, Wu Zhiqiang, Hu Haixin, Zhang Tiegang, and
staff members Wang Guilan and Li Zhanying.
</P>
<P>
Since March 24, they have written more than 560 Chinese and
English stories in 350,000 words that have had a great impact on
readers at home and abroad. Shao Yunhuan, who was assigned to
Belgrade on March 15, wrote many accurate and lively stories about
the NATO's aggression and the Yugoslavian army and people's
resistance against it.
</P>
<P>
All Xinhua staff members were asked to learn from the team of
correspondents who worked in Yugoslavia in spite of the danger,
difficulties, and sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua has asked its staff members to unite more closely around
the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party with Jiang
Zemin at the core, to uphold the great banner of Deng Xiaoping
Theory, and work hard to accomplish the glorious task assigned by
the Party and the people.

technologies for the benefit of member countries.
</P>
<P>
Activities that would meet sustainable development objectives

<P>
The countries would source strategies to secure international
donor support and private sector participation in the
implementation of actions to attract private investment, Zambia
Daily Mail newspaper reported Wednesday .
</P>
<P>
The countries will also jointly enhance technical capacity of
SADC countries and regional institutions aimed at attracting
international investment in clean energy technologies.

<HEADLINE> Development of Hi-Tech Economy Urged in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- "New Zealand is in danger of
being left
behind along with third world countries unless technology experts
are
increased," the Dominion Wednesday quoted New Zealand professor
Howard
Frederick as saying.
</P>
<P>
Frederick, who holds a chair of communications of the Victoria

University in Wellington, will present an impact report on New
Zealand's
future in the "knowledge economy" to New Zealand Information
Technology
Minister Maurice Williamson next month, according to the
Wellington-based
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"Fiscally, New Zealand is sound, but there is a darker side,
one that
many fail to recognize," the professor told the Dominion.
</P>
<P>
"The darker side is that New Zealand risks being left in the
wake of
competitors that are beginning to play by a different game, one
which
revolves around information and technology-led growth," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
"New Zealand still fits the agricultural society model, with
more than
10 percent of the population engaged in agricultural production.
We are
still caught in the game of commodity exports, primary products,
wood,
paper, wool and meat, while the others are preparing to do battle
in
different spheres," Frederick said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that information and communications technologies have
become
an "engine of economic growth" for many of New Zealand's
competitors.
</P>
<P>
New Zealanders are too self-congratulatory about their
life-style
though a huge brain drain is being fueled by young people fleeing
the
country, the professor said.
</P>
<P>
"New Zealand is not recognized as a technology and knowledge
society,
but for its clean green image with sheep and extreme sports," he
said,
adding: "If we don't do something now we may doom future
generations of
our country to a pastural subsistence."

<HEADLINE> Survey Finds Milk Powder of Famous Brands Good in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A survey has found that milk powder
of domestic famous brands which is specially made for infants is
good, while same kind of imported products and products from
foreign-funded companies also have standard quality.
</P>
<P>
The State Quality and Technological Supervision Bureau
conducted a survey on manufacturers and wholesalers of infant milk
powder in Shenyang, Harbin, Shanghai, Chengdu, Tianjin,
Shijiazhuang and Zibo cities during the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that products from Chinese manufacturers of
famous brand milk powder, who have been following strict quality
control principles, could all meet the state standards.
</P>
<P>
Imported milk powder and products from the foreign-funded
companies, which have already occupied a considerable part of the
Chinese market, also did well in the survey.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, about 62 percent of the products from
medium-sized enterprises were qualified, up five percent compared
with the figure of 1997. But there are still some quality problems
with products from small companies.
</P>
<P>
The output of infant milk powder in China has increased form 10,
000 tons in 1990 to 80,000 tons. Products of domestic famous
brands and foreign-funded companies and imported products have the
lion's share of the Chinese market.

<HEADLINE> China Has Enormous Demand for Environment-Friendly Autos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A State Environmental Protection
Administration official said today that environment-friendly autos
have great market potential in China now that vehicle emissions
have become a primary source of pollution in most Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
China now boasts 15 million automobiles, triple the figure for
the early 1990s, and in some major cities vehicle emissions have
replaced soot as major cause of air pollution.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China has only about 10,000 environment-
friendly autos, including those fueled by natural gas and liquid
petroleum gas.
</P>
<P>
The Law on Preventing Air Pollution, revised and implemented in
1995, has improved China's vehicle emissions qualification rate
from 40 percent in 1995 to the present 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, Beijing, as well as a number
of other major Chinese cities, has stopped issuing licenses to new
autos whose emission do not meet national standards.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that although the number of buses and
taxies accounts for only eight percent of all motor vehicles in
China, the total distances of these public transportation means
travel account for 40 to 50 percent of all motor travel.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, Beijing plans to add another 17,000
gas-fueled vehicles to its public transportation sector this year.

<HEADLINE> Three Ugandan Ministers to Be Queried Over Bribery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials of the Addis-based Midroc (Muhammad Investment
Development Research Organization Company), which bid to buy the
five-star hotel, will be invited to testify before the MPs over
the bribery allegations, the New Vision daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tom Omongole, chairman of the parliamentary select committee on
 privatization, was quoted as saying that the probe on this matter
would start as soon as the parliament, in recess at present,
reopens in early June.
</P>
<P>
The committee is to verify whether there was any foul play in
the divestiture of the hotel as alleged by Midroc before making
any verdict, he said.
</P>
<P>
If the three ministers are proved to be corrupt, the hotel
would be awarded to the company. However, if the company is proved
to be tarnishing the names of the ministers, the award of the
hotel would be canceled and fresh bidding would be called for, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
Midroc, owned by a Saudi millionaire Muhammad Al-Amoudi,
alleged that it failed to complete the 17-million-dollar pay for
the hotel because of the huge bribe demand.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The massive worm havoc has
continued relentlessly in most parts of Kenya in the past few
days, devastating thousands of hectares of farm land and pasture.
</P>
<P>
Farmers were losing their crops due to inadequate pesticides to
 contain the spread, the official newspaper Kenya Times reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture broke its one-week silence over the
worm disaster and will issue a statement on the problem Wednesday
morning, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
A local agricultural official for Rift Valley Province in west
Kenya, the most-hit area, said Tuesday that the Kenyan government
had acted to avert a further disaster by supplying pesticides but
the supply was not adequate and farmers should purchase more
pesticide.
</P>
<P>
Several parts of Central Province had also been invaded by
voracious worms, which wreaked havoc on most plants like napier
grass and other ordinary pasture.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan agricultural officials also fear that the worms would
destroy the maize plantation, saying that in areas where farmers
planted their crops earlier, the worms would not have much impact.

<HEADLINE> African Regional Meeting on Risk Reduction Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A four-day conference on Disaster
Reduction for Africa in the 21st century opened here Tuesday, with
representatives from 30 African countries and 12 international
organizations and NGOs to discuss socio-economic, scientific,
technical and development aspects of disaster reduction.
</P>
<P>
As part of concluding events of the International
Disaster-reduction Decade, the meeting will provide an opportunity
to assess the accomplishments of disaster reduction in Africa in
the past nine years and chart the direction for sustained disaster
prevention in the future.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of Klaus Topfer, Executive Director of the
United Nations Environment program (UNEP), Executive Secretary of
the Ozone Secretariat Madhava Sarma said that Africa cannot remain
immune to the impacts of global climate change.
</P>
<P>
Desertification is more likely to become irreversible if the
environment becomes drier and the soil is further degraded through
erosion, he said, adding that Africa was unprepared for disasters
like El Nino and unable to overcome the consequences or meet the
costs of rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
Sarma said that UNEP and Office of Coordination for
Humanitarian Affairs have sought to address these problems by
bringing together available international mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan State Minister Amukowa Anangwe said at the opening
ceremony that Africa cannot afford natural disasters because they
tend to exacerbate poverty conditions.
</P>
<P>
"A single natural disaster in an African country may reverse
fundamentally the gains made on the development front, " Anangwe
said.
</P>
<P>
Anangwe argues that emphasis should be put on disaster
prevention and sustainable development, effective early warning
systems, political and public policy commitment, shared knowledge
and technology transfer.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the regional meeting is part of closing events of
the Decade,
</P>
<P>
Anangwe said he supported the creation within the United
Nations system of a mechanism to deal with disasters beyond this
Decade.
</P>
<P>
Director of the IDNDR Secretariat Philippe Boulle said that the
regional meeting will consider the issues conducive to disaster
prevention and risk management in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), Edward G.
Howard- Clinton proposed the establishment of a disaster
coordination Center for Africa in order to respond to the need for
disaster reduction and its management in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Disaster management has been a priority concern of the OAU, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The meeting from May 18 through 21 has been organized by the
International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction Secretariat
(IDNDR, 1990-2000), together with the UNEP under the sponsorship
of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA).

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Establish Garments Villages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will establish three
garments villages soon in a bid to boost its garments industry,
the major foreign exchange earner of the country.
</P>
<P>
A committee has been formed to select venues suitable for
developing garments villages, a report in Wednesday's New Nation
daily newspaper quoted sources close to the Commerce and
Industries Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government will mobilize efforts of state and private
sectors together to establish garments villages so that package
infrastructure facilities could be easily available and
manageable, they said.
</P>
<P>
The proposed garments villages will be exclusively open for
establishing export-oriented apparel industrial units and its
backward linkage industries.
</P>
<P>
The facility packages to be provided to the entrepreneurs and
investors will encourage the private sector to participate in the
growth and development of exportable ready-made garments.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of garments villages will also expedite
inflow of foreign direct investment and joint ventures in the
textile and ready-made garments sectors, they added.
</P>
<P>
The garments villages are likely to be planned on the basis of
a broad and outward-looking export-oriented industrialization
policy, increasingly reliant on private enterprises. Both the
woven garments and knitwear garments will get preference in the
garments villages.
</P>
<P>
The ready-made garment is the single-most item which alone
contributed more than 55 percent to the total export earnings
during the last fiscal year (July 1997-June 1998), while knitwear
contributed about 18 percent. The apparel sector as whole earned
around 3.8 billion U.S. dollars during last fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Activities Proposed to Publicize COMESA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-governmental Committee of
the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) Tuesday
proposed a number of activities to publicize the organization,
which most of the people in the sub-region know nothing about.
</P>
<P>
Charles Chanthunya, Director of Trade, Customs and Monetary
Affairs of the COMESA Secretariat, revealed this at a press
conference in Kenyan capital Nairobi here.
</P>
<P>
The committee of permanent secretaries from COMESA member
states have been discussing programs and action plans in all the
sectors of cooperation except in the finance and monetary sector.
</P>
<P>
The proposed activities will be implemented in the sub-region
during the count down toward the free trade area by October, 2000,
said Chanthunya.
</P>
<P>
High on the proposed agenda is an extraordinary summit of heads
of state and government on October 31, 2000, when the free trade
area will be launched.
</P>
<P>
And various countries will hopefully stage activities to mark
the occasion. Torches will be lit to symbolize the launching of
the free trade area., he said.
</P>
<P>
There will be business forum for discussions about the
implication of the free trade area in the region.
</P>
<P>
Major trade fairs will be held so that COMESA member states can
exhibit their products and people can see what they can source
from one another.
</P>
<P>
The event is aimed at making people aware of what they can get
from within the region, the COMESA official noted, adding that
some member states are exporting goods to the European countries
while others are importing the same goods from Europe.
</P>
<P>
The inter-governmental committee has even proposed holding
sports activities for women like net ball, in order to advertise
the COMESA.
</P>
<P>
It also suggested an essay competition in secondary schools in
all member states and it will award three prizes for the best
three essays in each member states, an idea of enabling the young
generation to know the COMESA because they are to implement the
COMESA programs and benefit from the programs.
</P>
<P>
They should come to know the COMESA from the very beginning,
said Chanthunya.
</P>
<P>
As proposed, the member states should issue postage stamps from
January next year so that more people will know about the regional
organization.
</P>
<P>
There are a number of other activities proposed to advertise
the sub- regional organization established in 1994 to replace the
Preferential Trade Area for Eastern and Southern Africa which had
been in existence since 1981.
</P>
<P>
Through various activities, more people will know that the
COMESA was established not for its own sake but to benefit all the
people in the sub- region and to raise their living standards,
said Chanthunya.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the COMESA has 21 members: Angola, Burundi, the
Comoros, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Egypt,
Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia,
Rwanda, Seychelles, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and
Zimbabwe.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The US-led NATO's bombing of the
Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia should not hamper economic and trade
relations between east China's Shandong Province and the United
States and European Union countries, according to an official
notice issued to local economic and trade units.
</P>
<P>
Wang Chuntao, director of the local foreign trade and economic
cooperation commission, emphasized that Shandong will protect the
legal rights, interests, property, and personnel of the U.S. and E.
U., and will ensure the work of all local projects funded by them.
</P>

Following the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia,
local Chinese expressed their indignation by lodging protests
against the U.S.-led NATO's brutal act. Nonetheless, Wang said the
province will continue to develop its economic ties with the
business concerns of those countries.
</P>
<P>
During the January-April period this year, bilateral trade
between Shandong Province and the U.S. rose 13.2 percent on a
yearly basis, and bilateral trade with the E.U. grew by 8.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
The United States is the second largest overseas investor in
Shandong, and local trade with the U.S. ranks third among the
local bilateral trade with overseas countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> Important Role for China's Urban Communities Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Communities will play an
increasingly important role in Chinese cities, said Li Baoku, Vice-
Minister of Civil Affairs, in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
In the past, most urban Chinese lived in so-called welfare
quarters affiliated with various work units which provided free
housing and related services for their workers. However, with the
reform process in full swing, most residents now have to buy their
own housing and pay for such services as public cleaning.
</P>
<P>
"Further improving the function of communities and helping to
solve various community-related problems have become an important
task for urban administrations," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in China an urban community usually refers to a
neighborhood community, and along with social and economic
development, these communities will play an ever larger role in
solving urban problems.
</P>
<P>
"Community improvement, including medical, environmental,
educational, cultural and public security services, will become
the main task for China's future grass-roots level urban
management," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, China has already begun trial community-
improvement pilot projects in 11 varied urban districts.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Revises Growth Forecast to 0-2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government is
revising upwards its 1999 GDP growth forecast from minus one-plus
one percent to 0-2 percent after a government survey showed
Wednesday that the economy grew by a modest 1.2 percent in the
first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate was achieved largely on the back of the strong
performance in the manufacturing sector, said the first quarter
economic survey.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Secretary Ho Meng Kit of the Ministry of Trade and
Industry A (MTI) told a press briefing on Wednesday that this
means the Singapore Economy is recovering after contracting for
two consecutive quarters in the late half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Robust expansion in the electronics and chemicals industries
boosted the manufacturing sector in the first quarter while growth
in other manufacturing sub-sectors remained weak and the
construction, commerce and financial and business services sectors
continued to shrink, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, the manufacturing sector grew by 6.5
percent in the first quarter after contracting for three quarters
in a row. The electronics industry expanded by 14 percent due to
stronger demand from the U.S. and the pick-up in global
electronics industry. The chemical product industry grew by 19
percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that construction activity shrank by nine
percent in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter.
Commerce sector contraction moderated to minus 2.1 percent from
the minus 6.3 percent in the proceeding quarter.
</P>
<P>
The survey also signals an improvement in the transport and
communications sector which saw a 5.7 percent growth in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The financial and business services sector, however, contracted
by 0.6 percent with financial services sector shrinking sharply by
5.3 percent, after a 0.5 percent decline in the last quarter of
1998, due to a high base a year ago and the poor lending sentiment
to non-bank customers in the domestic and offshore markets.
</P>
<P>
The labor market remained weak in the first quarter with total
employment contracting by 17,800 and about 2,800 workers
retrenched. However, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate
eased to 3.9 percent in March from 4.4 percent in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
The cost-cutting package has contributed to the significant
easing of cost pressures in the first quarter with the unit labor
cost (ULC) of the overall economy falling by 10 percent as a
result of wage cuts and productivity growth.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing and services investment commitments totaled 2.14
billion Singapore dollars (1.26 billion U.S. dollars) with foreign
commitments accounting for more than three quarters of the total.
</P>
<P>
Total trade fell by 9.4 percent in value terms, down from minus
15 percent a quarter earlier with the decline in non-oil domestic
exports moderating from minus 6.7 percent in the final quarter of
last year to minus 3.2 percent in the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Business sentiment has improved with industrialists more upbeat
and the commerce and services providers remaining pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
On the outlook for 1999, the survey said the global economic
climate has improved in the last few months although uncertainties
remain, adding that the regional economies are bottoming out
although the turnaround in the real economy remains patchy.
</P>
<P>
Drawing attention to the potential stress points in the U.S.
economy, the expected growth moderation in the EU, the challenges
in Japan's economic convalescence as well as social-political
stresses in regional countries, the survey said the overall
optimistic sentiment masks the latent risks in the global economy.

<HEADLINE> Price Increases Slammed In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Consumer Council of Zimbabwe
(CCZ) Tuesday described the past year as being a "very difficult
one" as evidenced by the unprecedented price hikes and high
inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
The CCZ said in a statement prices of basic commodities had
gone up by at least 300 percent and would continue to increase
while last year's 67 percent fuel increase had eroded the
disposable income of consumers, the daily Herald reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
CCZ regional manager Victor Chisi said that many people would
now settle for one meal a day as the prices of basic foodstuffs
had gone up.
</P>
<P>
The number of people who cannot afford basic commodities is
likely to go up following the recent price increases of bread and
milk, he said.
</P>
<P>
CCZ executive Director Elizabeth Nerwande said the issue of
prices needed to be viewed historically and this called for the
participation of all sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
She said, "The CCZ calls for a commission of inquiry into price
 increases with a greater focus on whether the inputs costs
claimed by the companies are justified."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zimbabwe's opposition National Debate Association
condemned the producers of basic commodities for not considering
the hardships that were being faced by consumers.
</P>
<P>
The association said the government should use its powers to
punish producers for defying its call to consult first before
hiking prices.
</P>
<P>
The association also warned that consumer resistance would
follow if the producers disregarded the plight of the consumers.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Clustered Computer System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists say they have
developed a new high-performance computer system known as a
clustered system.
</P>
<P>
 The clustered computer system, listed as one of China's major
high-tech programs, has a potential speed up to 16 billion
performances per second.
</P>
<P>
Computer experts here believe this is a big leap forward for
the national computer industry.
</P>
<P>
Today's overseas edition of the People's Daily reports that the
clustered computer system, the so-called "Probe 108," is developed
by Qinghua University, and that the Qinghua Tongfang Corporation
is equipped with the industrial capacity to produce this system.
</P>
<P>
Experts say high-performance computer systems have the capacity
to store enormous amounts of data and can be widely used in oil
prospecting, weather forecasts, gene engineering programs, new-
weapons design, and the development of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
At present, the "Probe 108" is in trial operation at the
Beijing Meteorological Station for forecasting the weather 36
hours in advance.
</P>
<P>
The Qinghua Tongfang Corporation said the price of this newly
developed computer system is only one-tenth that of a similar
system produced by IBM.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Countries to Invest in Petrochemical Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Gulf countries are planning to
invest some 21.2 billion U.S. dollars in new petrochemical
projects, with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) taking a share of
about 17.3 percent in the investment.
</P>
<P>
The UAE had laid emphasis on the petrochemical industry in
recent years as part of its diversification process within the oil
industry sector, the Gulf News daily on Wednesday quoted UAE
Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Obeid bin Saif Al
Nasir as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The aim of this process is to maximize revenues by adding
value to products and creating more jobs," said the minister,
adding that the policy of diversification had paid off.
</P>
<P>
The UAE's economy was the least affected among other economies
in the region from the depressed oil prices last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East petrochemical industry is at a crossroads as
governments open up the industry to private investors.
</P>
<P>
The process, he said, could promise countless opportunities
for the private sector, which is already playing a vital role
in economic activities throughout the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
With Gulf countries making great efforts to develop the
petrochemical industry, the technology requirements for the
industry require more attention, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Technology transfer can have the greatest impact on the
industry and multinational companies can play a major role in
fulfilling this objective," he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that Gulf countries had invested a total
of 16 billion dollars in petrochemicals by the end of 1998,
which reflected the importance of the industry as well as its
future prospects in the region.

FUZHOU, May 19 (Xinhua) -- All counties in Fujian Province in
south China can now receive cloud charts sent back by
meteorological satellite with the recent installation of a system
linking them together.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Fujian has become the country's first province in which
all counties are capable of receiving cloud pictures sent back via
satellite.
</P>
<P>
The system, which cost six million yuan and took three years to
build, will help the province cope with natural disasters such as
typhoons and flooding, that occur in Fujian nearly every year,
restricting local economic development.
</P>
<P>
Last year, there were large floods in Fujian's Minjiang River.
However, 15 billion yuan was saved due to the adoption of anti-
flood measures taken beforehand in accord with cloud charts
released by the provincial meteorological station.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Election Campaign Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia began its 17-day election
campaign Wednesday, as political parties launched parades through
the capital city of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
About 240 cars carrying symbols and flags of the 48 political
parties drove to the main streets from the National Monument
(Monas) in Central Jakarta in the morning, making the beginning of
the campaign period for the June 7 general elections.
</P>
<P>
From Monas, the vehicles were driving along Jalan MH Thamrin
(street) before separating to five parts of the city -- Central,
North, West, South and East Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Many fear that party supporters will partake in the carnival,
which could bring Jakarta to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
Anticipating the possibility, the city's Regional Election
Committee has called on party task forces to cooperate with
security forces in controlling party supporters.
</P>
<P>
Despite a deployment of a 62,000-strong security force to
maintain law and order in Jakarta during the campaign period, many
offices were closed for the day.
</P>
<P>
In fact, political parties have been busy promoting themselves
by various propaganda activities in other big cities as well as in
the capital city.
</P>
<P>
According to the rules of the General Election Commission
(KPU), there are about 10 political parties conducting their
campaigns every day in each big city. So, many people fear clashes
between the supporters of different parties would take place.
</P>
<P>
Election officials and party representatives on Tuesday held
prayers for peaceful elections in the archipelago country.
</P>
<P>
But fears of conflict were fulfilled on Tuesday in Pekalongan,
Central Java, where 14 homes were burned and at least 11 people
were injured in a clash involving thousands of supporters of two
Muslim parties. Official sources said clashes between parties in
the last few weeks have claimed about 20 lives.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 people were killed in the election campaign in
1997. Most of them were died in clashes and traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
During the current campaign period, senior political leaders
will meet their supporters. The contenders will also campaign
through public gatherings, meetings and through national
television and radio broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
The coming general election will be different from the previous
ones, with as many as 48 parties contesting. In the past 30 years,
only three parties were allowed to contest.
</P>
<P>
There are now a total of 148 political parties in Indonesia,
with most of them established after former president Soeharto
stepped down last May amid the country's worst political and
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
There is a total of 68,000 villages in Indonesia, plus 4,000
districts, 327 regencies and 27 provinces. The country's 128
million eligible voters will elect 462 candidates to the 500-seat
House of Representatives (DPR) in the forthcoming election. The
remaining 38 seats will be reserved for the Armed Forces which do
not vote.
</P>
<P>
The newly elected DPR will form the People's Consultative
Assembly (MPR) together with 200 members nominated by the
president. The MPR, the highest legislative body, is expected to
hold a meeting to elect the next president and vice president in
November this year.

<HEADLINE> Luxury Condo, Hotel Market in Thailand to Bottom Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The luxury condominium market in
Bangkok, as well as hotels, are the only property sectors likely
to bottom out within a year, the Bangkok Post Wednesday quoted
international consultants as saying.
</P>
<P>
A limited new supply of condo units, combined with anticipated
improvement in demand, would allow the sector to approach balance,
Jones Lang LaSalle (Thailand), a property consulting company, was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Steady demand and a decreasing number of unsold units have
shown that the market is stabilizing.
</P>
<P>
The company said the market is expected to bottom out over the
next 12 months as prices consolidate.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that in Bangkok's central business district,
only one luxury condominium, with 185 units, came on the market in
the six months ending in March.
</P>
<P>
Last year, about 1,500 luxury units were sold, a trend likely
to continue given confidence in a recovery combined with
discounted prices, the company said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prices are unlikely to rise, since the consumer
confidence, although improving, remains fragile.
</P>
<P>
Demand will continue to concentrate on completed projects that
offer highly attractive discounts, the company said.

<HEADLINE> DuPont to Expand Lycra Market in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. chemical giant DuPont will
spend almost 40 million baht (about one million U.S. dollars) in
Thailand to promote Lycra, a highly-stretchable synthetic fabric
used in making underwear, swimsuits and runner gear, the Bangkok
Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The allocation of the one million dollars to Thailand is part
of a 30-million-dollar global campaign, the first in the 40-year
history of DuPont's Lycra brand.
</P>
<P>
A DuPont survey of more than 85,000 consumers in a total of 20
countries showed a preference for comfortable, easy-care clothing,
good quality and brand name products.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> 157 Big Defaulters Go Into Hiding in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A total of 157 big defaulters in
Bangladesh have gone into hiding after grabbing a huge amount of
money from different banks, The Bangladesh Observer reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The fact was disclosed at a seminar on Tuesday by Professor
A.T.M. Abdus Shahid of the Bangladesh Institute of Bank Management
(BIBM), which organized the seminar on "Bank Loan Default Problem:
a Dialog Between Borrowers and Lenders."
</P>
<P>
The hiding defaulters might have changed their addresses after
taking loans from the banks, or the loans were provided to them in
fictitious names, Shahid said in his keynote paper, which was
based on a survey conducted by the BIBM.
</P>
<P>
According to Shahid, the 157 among the listed 2,117 big
defaulters of the country were industrial borrowers.
</P>
<P>
The list of defaulters was announced by Finance Minister Shah
A.M.S. Kibria in parliament last year, and according to the
Banking Regulation and Policy Department of the Bangladesh Bank,
the classified loans stood at 199 billion taka (about 4.1 billion
U.S. dollars) at the end of June last year.
</P>
<P>
Political influence and malpractice by both the bankers and
borrowers were among the reasons for the huge amount of bad loans,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The BIBM survey showed that of 125 defaulters interviewed, 82
got loans through political influence.
</P>
<P>
The BIBM suggested a comprehensive action plan to recover the
outstanding loans, under which an ombudsman should be appointed to
take prompt action against the corrupt bankers, and punitive
measures be taken for malpractice in the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Citing causes which forced entrepreneurs to become defaulters,
President of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and
Industries (FBCCI) Abdul Awal Mintoo said that bank defaults were
the result of managerial problems.
</P>
<P>
The issue was becoming more complicated, he said, as the
government politicized the default issue instead of looking into
the problems. Mintoo urged the government to form a committee to
determine the actual amount of bad loans and suggest recovery
measures.
</P>
<P>
A.M. Zahiruddin Khan, an industrialist, said the frequent
changes in the financial policies following the changes of
governments also affected business and made many defaulters.
</P>
<P>
The default culture in Bangladesh could not be removed unless
corruption in other sectors in society and the administration was
checked, according to former FBCCI President Yusuf Abdullah Harun,
who suggested that corrupt bankers and officials should also be
brought under legal action like the defaulters.

ADDIS ABABA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian President Negaso
Gidada Tuesday hailed Chinese leadership's firm, patient and wise
reaction to NATO' s missile attack on Chinese embassy in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In a message to Chinese President Jiang Zemin via Chinese

with patience and wisdom."
</P>

He also expressed his heart-felt sympathy and condolences to
the victims of the attack and their families.

those who care for principles of international law and for a
peaceful world."

<HEADLINE> Chaudhry Sworn in As Fiji's First Indian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Indian unionist Mahendra Chaudhry
was sworn in earlier Wednesday as Fiji's first Indian prime
minister following his landslide victory in this week's election.
</P>
<P>
Sources in Suva, capital of the island country in the South
Pacific, told Xinhua that Chaudhry visited Fijian President
Kamisese Mara earlier Wednesday prior to the swearing-in ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Chaudhry's Fiji Labor Party clinched 37 seats in the 71-seat
Fijian Parliament, one seat more than what is required to form a
government under Fiji's new constitution.
</P>
<P>
Labor's two coalition partners, including the Fijian
Association Party, also captured 14 seats.
</P>
<P>
Chaudhry's predecessor Sitiveni Rabuka's coalition took only 8
of the 71 seats.
</P>
<P>
Rabuka, who formally resigned Tuesday as prime minister, had
been re-elected as prime minister in 1994.
</P>
<P>
He staged a coup in 1987, arguing that Fijians were losing
control of their country, and introduced a constitution in 1990
which guaranteed native political dominance, press reports here
said.
</P>
<P>
Indians, descendants of indentured laborers brought to Fiji at
the turn of the century which comprise 44 percent of the
population in Fiji, dumped Rabuka's Indian coalition partner the
National Federation party.
</P>
<P>
Rabuka also suffered a backlash among his own fellow Fijians,
who comprise 51 percent of the population.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- With a candle in her hands, Niki
Core, gazing at the portraits of the three Chinese journalists
killed by NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, could
not keep her tears from falling.
</P>
<P>
"Let us pray for peace and mourn for the victims," she said.
</P>
<P>
Core is one of the over 500 people who attended the Candlelight
Vigil and Singing for Peace service at Lafayette Park in front of
the White House on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The service, sponsored by 36 organizations from the Chinese
communities in the United States, was dedicated to the three
Chinese journalists, Shao Yunhuan, Xu Xinghu and Zhu Ying, who
were killed when the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
struck the Chinese embassy on May 7.
</P>
<P>
When Wang Xiaoge, a Chinese American singer, sang the song "
Motherless Child," many people were in tears." I dedicated this
song to Cao Lei -- whose mother, Shao Yunhuan, was killed -- and
all those who lost their mothers in NATO's bombing," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I feel like a motherless child ... Long way from
home ... Sometimes I'm almost gone ..." the song said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the rally, Xu Zhaoran, one of the organizers of the
event, condemned the bombing.
</P>
<P>
"We were shocked and saddened by the tragic bombing of the
Chinese embassy in Belgrade," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must join hands to condemn the killings of innocents, help
heal the wounds, pray for peace, and mend U.S.-China relations,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy aroused world-wide
condemnation. "Every people with a conscience condemn it," said
Malcolm Cannon, Washington organizer of the International Action
Center.
</P>
<P>
"We want to express our solidarity with the Chinese people,
with the families of the victims," he noted when addressing the
event.
</P>
<P>
Cannon said NATO's bombing has only killed more innocent people
and created more refugees. "Tens of thousands of civilians have
fled Kosovo and thousands have been killed since NATO started
bombing Yugoslavia on March 24." The alliance vowed to pressure
Belgrade to accept its conditions by the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
"We want to struggle with the Chinese people to bring an end to
this bombing, to bring an end to this criminal war, to say no to
the U.S. government and to say no to the lies of the media of this
country," Cannon added.
</P>
<P>
Most of the participants held a candle in their hands. Some
raised signs and pictures of Shao, Xu and Zhu. Different signs
read "Stop Bombing, Stop Killing, Stop War" to "Mother/Daughter
Killed Just Before Mother's Day."
</P>
<P>
Moving songs were also sung by some American singers.
</P>
<P>
"This little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine, let it
shine," sang Rose Bellow with tears in her eyes.
</P>
<P>
 The song coincides with a feature story written by Shao
Yunhuan, who had been a Xinhua correspondent in Belgrade before
she was killed. In the story entitled "Long Night without Light,"
Shao describes the night after NATO bombed the power plant in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The songs touched everyone. Many were in tears. With a
trembling voice, Joan McCorney, a 60-year-old lady, said, "Tonight
we sing for peace, we pray for peace and we cry for peace."

 Kiev, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian parliament and the

possible to support Yugoslavia's effort to stop NATO's invasion
and to help introduce a peaceful solution to the Kosovo conflict,
said Boris Oleinik, the chairman of the foreign affairs committee

NATO's bombing has brought on a serious threat to Ukrainian

has been commissioned, and is expected to boost the Sino-Russian
border trade and international development of the Tumen River
region.
</P>
<P>
The operation of the railway line, which is part of the

JINAN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province has
decided to establish additional institutions of higher learning
with overseas funds.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the Shandong Provincial Education Committee said
that overseas enterprises and individuals are encouraged to set up
solely funded, join-venture or joint-stock universities and
colleges in the province.
</P>
<P>
This is part of Shandong's effort to ease the shortage of

</P>
<P>
Only one-third of some 300,000 high school graduates in
Shandong are able to enter universities each year.

The province has taken a series of measures in recent years to
step up the development of higher learning, such as allowing
individuals to invest in education.

Nationwide, China is giving top priority to education by
pursuing the policy of reform and opening-up and vigorously

<HEADLINE> Gansu Closes More Small Coal Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Gansu, a major coal-consuming
province in northwest China, recently shut down 379 illegal and
unreasonably located coal mines, reducing coal output by 2.9
million tons in the first four months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Another 144 small coal mines are expected to be shut down by
the end of this month, according to one provincial official.
</P>
<P>
This will bring the total shut-downs to 523 and an output
reduction of four million tons this year.
</P>
<P>
These moves are part of a nationwide effort to further restrict
the blind development of small coal mines in order to save
resources, reduce accidents, and improve the environment.
</P>
<P>
China is planning to close down 25,800 small coal mines and cut
coal production by 250 million tons to 1.1 billion tons this year.
</P>
<P>
Gansu has 1,300 small coal mines run by collectives or state
firms. These poorly equipped mines are the site of frequent
accidents, and also cause heavy pollution in the local environment.
</P>
<P>
In addition, blind production by small mines had led to an
oversupply of coal and a price war on the local market, posing a
serious threat to the normal operations of state-run coal mines.

BONN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Germany wishes to promote the
development of relations between the European Union (EU) and Iran
by taking advantage of its term as the rotating EU presidency
between January and June, a senior government official said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, German Foreign Ministry Secretary of
State Wolfgang Ischinger said there is a general view among EU
member states that the time is ripe now to cautiously develop
political relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said he will go to the Iranian capital of Tehran along with
senior representatives of the countries which held the previous EU
presidency and will hold the next EU presidency to talk with
Iranian deputy foreign minister Mortesa Sarmadi on major issues,
including the development of EU-Iranian relations.
</P>
<P>
Germany took over the rotating presidency from Austria in
January. Finland will assume the next six-month term.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and European Union states were strained
by a 1997 German court ruling that implicated Iran's highest
leaders in the 1992 assassination of an Iranian Kurdish opposition
leader in Berlin.

Also Tuesday, Britain and Iran agreed to exchange ambassadors,

<HEADLINE> Chinese Insurers Explore Internet Opportunities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- More and more insurance companies
in China are now setting up their own Internet sites to broaden
their business opportunities in cyberspace against the backdrop of
rapidly increasing Internet users.
</P>
<P>
Investigations show that by the beginning of 1997, most of the
25 insurers operating in China had established Internet home pages.
</P>
<P>
These websites not only provide corporate profiles, and the
introduction of insurance products and services, but the ABCs of
insurance as well.
</P>
<P>
Potential customers may also make on-line inquiries through e-
mail.
</P>
<P>
Industrial analysts says the Internet is able to provide
potential customers with faster and easier access to insurance
companies and their products. By a few strokes on the keyboard,
customers can access the websites of many insurers and make
comparisons before making their insurance decision.
</P>
<P>
For insurance firms, the Internet means they have access to a
huge number of potential customers, unlimited by time or space.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that China now has over two million registered
Internet users, and this figure is expected to hit nearly five
million by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
In the words of Li Gang, deputy general manager of the Ping An
Insurance Corporation, the Internet has expanded the working hours
of insurance companies from eight to 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
The Internet also means lower overhead for insurance sales.
According to a survey in the United States, the average cost of
consultation is five U.S. dollars per person per time, while on-
line consultation can cost as little as four cents.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts says China's insurance industry still has a
long way from fully utilizing the Internet.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua)-- Facilities and technology have not
kept pace with the aggressive growth of China's fast-food industry,
restricting further development, according to a recent issue of
the China Industry and Commerce News.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Han Ming, head of the service and
consumption department of the State Administration of Internal
Trade, as saying that the fast-food industry's production
equipment and technology are lagging behind new business
management techniques, and that is why it is losing ground to the
more modern Western snack food industry.
</P>
<P>
McDonalds, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Pizza Hut continue to be
the dominant players in the Chinese snack-food market.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the past eight years, the Chinese snack-
food industry has developed at an annual rate of 20 percent, and
that by the end of last year, this sector accounted for one-third
of all restaurant revenue nationwide. There now are nearly 500,000
snack-food companies in China.
</P>
<P>
To promote the upgrading of the Chinese fast-food industry, the
bureau will sponsor an international exhibition on related
equipment and technology in Beijing next April, he said. Around
200 Chinese and foreign fast-food companies are expected to take
part in the event, he said.

the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist, CPN-ML).
</P>
<P>
The CPN-ML has not won a single seat yet. And worse still, its
two top leaders Sahana Pradhan and Bam Dev Gautam both lost to
their rivals, though Gautam has another chance in the No. 1
constituency of Kathmandu, where the election is rescheduled for
June 8 after the death of CPN-UML candidate Man Mohan Adhikari.
</P>
<P>
Chandra Prakash Mainali, another powerful leader of the party,
also lost.
</P>
<P>
Vote counting started at 17:00 (1115 GMT) on Monday immediately

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Bank to Increase Presence in Inland China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The HongKong and Shanghai Banking
Corp. (HSBC) has decided to move its China head office from Hong
Kong to Shanghai in a bid to enlarge its business in inland areas.
</P>
<P>
This decision is based on the bank's firm confidence in China's
economic potential, according to Daniel Lam, head of the HSBC
Shanghai Branch.
</P>
<P>
The HSBC has been enjoying profits in inland areas, and that
has increased its confidence in the prospects in these areas, Lam
said.
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the Guangdong International Trust and
Investment Corp. has not changed the bank's views of this enormous
potential, Lam added.
</P>
<P>
The bank is now searching for a suitable site in Shanghai for
its China head office, and is expanding its electronic data
processing center in Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
HSBC's network in the inland areas currently includes eight
branches, one sub-branch, and three representative offices.
</P>
<P>
Lam said he believes China can overcome all the challenges
facing it, such as keeping unemployment at acceptable levels,
reducing bureaucracy, eliminating corruption, and withstanding
mounting competition from overseas businesses, after its entry
into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
"Any company that is focusing solely on short-term earnings
will continue to be disappointed, while those making long-term
commitments will be rewarded," Lam said.

<HEADLINE> China Prohibit Use of Unsafe Water Heaters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- China re-emphasized Tuesday the ban
on the production and sales of direct-emission water heaters for
bathrooms, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The direct-emission water heater emits waste gas into the
bathroom where it is placed, and therefore can easily cause harm
to the consumers, experts said.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to ensure the consumers' safety, the State
Administration of Light Industry and State Administration of
Internal Trade jointly issued a regulation to ban its production
and marketing early in April this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulation, all manufacturers must stop
production of direct-emission bathroom-use water heaters from
October 1 this year and all retailers must stop the sales of the
product on May 1 next year.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference on May 18, 33 producers of water heaters
promised to strengthen their co-operation with the retailers to
implement the regulation on time.
</P>
<P>
Some key producers, including Shanghai N&AMP;N Co Ltd and Guangdong
Shenzhou Group also displayed their new products with new
technology and safety standards at the conference. The companies
are planning a large scale promotion campaign in a view to
introducing new water heaters to consumers.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that about 30 million direct-emission
water heaters have been produced and most of them are still being
used.
</P>
<P>
Industrial authorities have called on consumers to phase them
out gradually according to their usage period. Owners who do not
replace them in time should perform regular safety inspections on
the water heaters to make sure they function properly.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Economy Grows By 1.2 Percent in Q1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's economy grew by 1.2
percent in the first quarter of this year after contracting for
two consecutive quarters, the Ministry of Trade and Industry
announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 1.2 percent gain was largely on the back of strong
performance in the manufacturing sector and growth momentum
measured on a seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter basis showed
a strong pick-up of 6.8 percent, the ministry said in its economy
survey of first quarter 1999.
</P>
<P>
The sectors of manufacturing and transportation and
communications grew 6.5 and 5.7 percent respectively while
construction, commerce and finance each contracted 9.0, 2.1 and
0.6 percent, according to the newly-released statistics.
</P>
<P>
Robust expansion in the electronics and chemicals industries
boosted the manufacturing sector in the first quarter, the survey
said.
</P>
<P>
Growth in other manufacturing subsectors, however, remained
weak and the construction, commerce and financial and business
services sectors continued to shrink, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of electronics and chemicals industries, by 14
and 19 percent respectively, contributed much to the 6.5 percent
growth of the manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
But the other industries such as machinery and equipment,
fabricated metal products and rubber/plastic continued to
contract, said the survey.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the financial and business services sector, the
city-state's the other growth engine, was mainly due to a high
base a year ago and poor lending sentiment to non-bank customers
in the domestic and offshore banks, the survey said.

Earlier, the two arrived at Budapest airport on board a NATO
military plane, escorted by International Red Cross (IRC)
officials. They were then delivered to the Hungarian border by
seven police cars.
</P>
<P>
An IRC official denied reports that the two had applied for
immigration to Hungary. He said they wanted to return to
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Horvah Gabor said they
chose the Hungarian border because they think it was the safest
route for them to return to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized this release should not be viewed as a NATO
goodwill gesture to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
NATO's condition on the settlement of Kosovo have not changed
at all, he added.
</P>
<P>
The two Serb soldiers were captured by members of the Kosovo
Liberation Army on April 21, and were then handed over to the U.S.
forces in Albania, who sent them to Germany for interment.

<HEADLINE> China to Upgrade Weather Radar Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- China is to upgrade its national
weather radar network, in an effort to strengthen its monitoring
of weather-related disasters such as tornadoes and reduce the
impact of disasters.
</P>
<P>
Li Huang, deputy director the China Meteorological
Administration (CMA), said that 100 most advanced Doppler weather
radars would be installed throughout China within a 10 year period
beginning last year.
</P>
<P>
Li said the upgraded weather radar system is expected to issue
early warnings for disastrous climate and weather changes.
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
He said the first of these radar systems was installed and
tested earlier this year in east China's Anhui Province which was
hit by devastating floods last summer along with some other
provinces along the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The second is scheduled for installation in Jianyang in east
China's coastal Fujian Province in October.
</P>
<P>
The Anhui radar is expected to be used for professional weather
forecasting before this year's flood season, reliable sources
close to the CMA said.
</P>
<P>
A senior CMA meteorologist estimated that the tornadoes cause
one billion yuan (120 million U.S. dollars) of damage each year in
coastal areas since many of them cannot be detected without a
Doppler radar.
</P>
<P>
The new type of radar will also be used in the decision-making
process of the state flood control and disaster prevention
authorities.

<HEADLINE> China Encourages Public to Protect Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- China will establish a new
mechanism to encourage the public to participate in environmental
protection activities, said a senior environmental official in
Beijing yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) is
considering to carry out annual appraisals of the public's efforts
in bettering their surroundings, said Wang Yuqing, SEPA's vice-
director, at a symposium on how to improve public participation in
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the devotion of many volunteers and non-governmental
organizations to environmental protection shows the public has a
strong sense of responsibility towards the country and society as
a whole.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily quoted him as saying that the efforts and
achievements of these individuals and groups should be encouraged,
so as to increase awareness regarding the need for more
environmental conservation work.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the contributions of concerned communities and
activities in schools should also be given special support, since
youth will be the main force behind tomorrow's environmental
protection drive.
</P>
<P>
Moreover a public supervision system to evaluate the
government's environmental protection work should be set up, as
required by State laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 20 experts, volunteers and non-governmental
organizations' leaders attended yesterday's meeting, exchanging
their views on how to improve public participation in the
environmental work.
</P>
<P>
There are about 2,000 organizations concerned with
environmental issues across the country, including over 200 at
national level, according to the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in Brazil Better Than Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Direct foreign investment in
Brazil totaled 9.24 billion U.S. dollars in the first four months
this year, more than double the figure of the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The number surpassed the most optimistic expectations of the
market, which stood at around 17 billion dollars for the whole
year. They were made following the devaluation of the Brazilian
currency, the real, months ago.
</P>
<P>
Some economists, including Odair Abate, the head of economics
at Citibank, now predict that the total foreign investment this
year could reach 20 to 22 billion dollars, which however is still
below last year's record figure of 26.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected increase in the first quarter is seen as a good
sign for the recovery of the national economy.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Tourists Angry With NATO (Recast) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia is not aimed at safeguarding
human rights but at protecting their economic interests, and
China's stand on the Kosovo issue has made some people very
unhappy," said Richard Buehler, a German teacher.
</P>
<P>
Buehler, who worked at Fudan University and the Shanghai
University of Foreign Languages some 20 years ago, led a tourist
group to China's largest industrial and commercial city of
Shanghai several days ago.
</P>
<P>
Buehler's group is not the only foreign tourist group that has
come to China over the past week.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Branch of the China International Tourist Service
alone received nearly 4,000 tourists and business people from
overseas in the past 10 days.
</P>
<P>
James Huston, an American doctor, was traveling in inland China
when he heard of the attack and later the U.S. State Department's
warning against travel to China.
</P>
<P>
"Why? We're sound and safe all our way in this country," Huston
said, adding he would tell his relatives in the United States
about the real facts of the attack upon his return home.
</P>
<P>
Joan Robincon was with a group of 112 Britons touring Xi'an,
home to the famous "Terra Cotta Worriers and Horses", the "
underground army" of China's first imperial emperor, last week.
She bought many model worriers and horses as gifts for her
relatives at home.
</P>
<P>
"Like you, I feel sorry and indignant, for I cannot agree to
NATO's bombing," Robincon said. "I hope to continue our friendly
contact with the Chinese people."

<HEADLINE> Austria Hopes Barak's Election Will Revive Middle East Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Austria said Tuesday that the
election of Labor leader Ehud Barak as Israel's new prime minister
augurs well for a revival of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement congratulating Barak on his sweeping
victory over incumbent Benjamin Netanyahu, Austrian Chancellor
Viktor Klima said the Israelis' choice of Barak is "a clear sign
that the Middle East peace process is sure to be put back on track.
"
</P>
<P>
The Israelis want to show their belief that Israel's own
security and reconciliation with the Palestinians are "two
interwoven basic factors of the peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Klima pledged strong support from Austria as well as the
European Union for the Israeli prime minister-elect in the "huge
challenges" facing him.
</P>
<P>
In his capacity as chairman of the Social-Democratic Party of
Austria, Klima expressed "extreme pleasure and satisfaction" for
the election of Barak.
</P>
<P>
In a press communique released Tuesday, Austrian Vice
Chancellor and Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel said Barak's
election indicates the Israelis' hope for a change in the
government's policies towards their Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Schuessel said he hoped the new Israeli government would give a
new push to the Middle East peace process on the basis of the Oslo
peace deal and make concrete progress in relations with the
Palestinians as well as with Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He noted that peace and reconciliation, "an irreplaceable
policy," is in the interest of all sides concerned.

<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major Beijing-
based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
"People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- A commentary published today by the People's Daily, China's
leading newspaper, hails the Chinese people's awareness and their
determination to strengthen their will in defying brutal forces,
fighting hegemony and safeguarding world peace.
</P>
<P>
The barbaric strike by U.S.-led NATO against the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade has pushed China into a special position in
the current world scenario, said the commentary entitled "Chinese
People's Awareness and Strength."
</P>
<P>
"There are in essence two issues here, one is that the savage
act, the aggressive nature of which is abundantly clear, can
hardly be concealed by flaunting as an excuse the issue of human
rights, humanitarianism, democracy, and freedom," said the article,
"the other is that we shall, as a result, concentrate on
developing productive forces and upgrade our comprehensive
national strength."
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese President Jiang Zemin met here Tuesday morning with
Li Ka-shing, chairman of the Cheung Kong ( Holdings) Ltd in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang highly praised Li for his support of economic
construction, education, and charity in inland areas. Jiang also
praised Li Ka-shing's contribution to the economic and social
development of Hong Kong, and said he hopes Li will continue to
contribute to Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
 "Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- The Chinese government has announced a series of new
measures in a bid to further reform its grain distribution system
and push the state-owned grain firms to become more market-
oriented.
</P>
<P>
The new reform package includes promoting readjustment of the
mix of farm produce, relinquishing administrative protection for
prices of part of grains and exercising a limit on financial aid
to state-owned grain enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came as a result of a national meeting on
reforms last week, when Premier Zhu Rongji urged governments at
all levels to earnestly carry out the measures.
</P>
<P>
 "China Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- China is accusing NATO of causing the "largest humanitarian
disaster since World War II" by bombing Yugoslavia, said Foreign

Kiev, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian parliament and the
delegation stationed in the council of Europe will do whatever
possible to support Yugoslavia's effort to stop NATO's invasion
and to help introduce a peaceful solution to the Kosovo conflict,
said Oleinik, the chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the
Ukrainian parliament.
</P>
<P>
NATO's bombing has brought on a serious threat to Ukrainian
security, since NATO may resort to military operations against
other countries that disagree with its position on human rights,
Oleinik said during a ceremony on the publishing of three poetry
anthologies by Ukraine's national poets.
</P>
<P>
The poetry anthologies were published in Ukraine and Serbia to

<HEADLINE> Women's Singles Produce Biggest Surprise in Badminton Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COPENHAGEN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Whereas the men's singles and
mixed doubles went on in accordance with the schedule except
sporadic sprays, the women's singles competitions produced the
day's biggest billow in the first round of the World Badminton
Championships here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ong Ewe Hock of Malaysia was the only seeded player who crashed
in the men's singles when he lost to Vladislav Druzchenko of
Ukraine Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The ninth seeded player, who established his status in
badminton in early nineties, lost the match at 15-13, 15-3.
</P>
<P>
World top ranked shuttler Peter Gade Christensen of Denmark
began his chase to his first world crown with an easy win, beating
Ahn Jee Chang of South Korea 15-3, 15-7.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, his compatriot defending champion Peter Rasmussen,
who never won a major tournament since his victory in Glasgow two
years ago, also had a smooth path to the second round by
outplaying Kevin Han of the United States 15-8, 15-3.
</P>
<P>
Former world champion China's Sun Jun, who was seeded second in
the tournament, met no challenge from little-known Ricardo
Fernandes of Portugal, winning the match 15-4, 15-5 in less than
20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Dong Jiong, another medal hope for China in the men's singles
event, met a strong resist from Olver Pongratz of Germany before
taking the match at 15-10 and 15-9.
</P>
<P>
He will meet Ardy Wiranata of United States in the second round.
Wiranata, who formerly a famous shuttler from Indonesia, needed
three sets to beat Juergen Koch of Austria 15-3, 13-15 and 15-1.
</P>
<P>
Wiranata said after the match that he would have little chance
for a place in the third round. "Dong Jiong is much better than me,
I will have little chance to win," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ye Zhaoying had her dream to make a hat-trick of
world champion smashed when she crashed out in the first round to
Kelly Morgen of Wales in women's singles.
</P>
<P>
The world top ranked Chinese player, seeded first in the
championships, went down to the Welsh after taking the first set
at 5-11, 11-9 and 13-12.
</P>
<P>
For both Ye and Morgen, the result meant more than a normal
competition. Many believed that Ye's defeat might be an end to
her domination of the women's badminton while Morgen gained more
from the match.
</P>
<P>
The Welsh, who never played Ye Zhaoying before, said she had
been looking forward to the game. "I came and I win. I still
could not believe it," she said.
</P>
<P>
"The victory meant more than the Commonwealth Games champion to
me," said Morgen, gold medal winner in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia last
year.
</P>
<P>
Third seed Camilla Martin of Denmark was also on the edge of
being eliminated in a first round match in which she managed to
beat Ellen Angelina of Indonesia 9-11, 11-7 and 11-9.
</P>
<P>
After leveling the score at one-all, Camilla was left behind in
the third set 6-9. Inspired by home crowds, Martin managed to
rally back to win the final set at 11-9.
</P>
<P>
All other seeds in the women's singles enjoyed comfortable wins
in the first round.
</P>
<P>
Second seed Gong Ruina of China trounced Chan Mei Mai of
China's Hong Kong 11-1, 11-4, fourth seed Dai Yun, also from China,
outplayed Ng Mee Fon of Malaysia 11-1, 11-4, fifth seeded Chinese
shuttler Zhang Ning needed a mere more than 10 minutes to brush
aside Brynja Petursdottir of Israel 11-2, 11-0 and sixth seed Zhou
Mi of China overwhelmed Karina De Witt of the Netherlands 11-6, 11-
2.
</P>
<P>
In the mixed doubles, three seeded pairs failed to make top 16
when Nathan Robertson/Joanne Davies of England, seeded 10th, lost
to Valeri Strelcov/Natalia Golovkina of Ukraine 15-5, 10-15, 8-15
and 15th seeded Alastair Gatt/Kirsteen Mcewan of Scotland were
crushed by Chang Chong Ming/Quay Swee Ling of Malaysia in two
identical scores of 4-15 in second round matches.
</P>
<P>
Another pair Wahyu Agung and Ema Ermawati of Indonesia, seeded
ninth, was beaten in first round by Chinese duo Chen Qiqiu and
Huang Sui at 15-7, 3-15, 15-10. Chen and Huang made their seat in
the top 16 with a 15-7 and 15-4 victory over Jean-M Lefort and
Christelle V.Szynal of France in the second round Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The men's and women's singles will produce top 16 while the
men's and women's doubles top 32.
</P>
<P>
The mixed doubles event will decide top eight after Wednesday's
matches.

PANAMA CITY, May 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. ambassador to Panama Simon

<HEADLINE> Italy, Germany Support UN Drawing Resolution on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Italy and Germany support the idea of
a United Nations resolution enshrining international demands for
Kosovo as the basis for finding a solution to the crisis, Italian
Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema and his German counterpart Gerhard
Schroeder said in Italy at the end of the Italian-German summit
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But the summit, which started Monday in Italian southeastern
city of Bari, did not produce the expected joint document based on
D'Alema's plan for a suspension of bombing.
</P>
<P>
"We did not produce any more documents in order to avoid
confusion, the document we are referring to is the G-8 one,"
D'Alema said at a joint press conference.
</P>
<P>
"A new document would have increased confusion," Schroeder
agreed.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the two leaders agreed to work towards "the widest
possible consensus" on the G-8 document, D'Alema said.
</P>
<P>
As for a possible halt to bombing, the Italian premier said it
"may be a necessary political act to pave the way for the solution
of the conflict - not an unconditional unilateral truce."
</P>
<P>
D'Alema's plan, rejected by NATO Monday, would shift the onus
onto the U.N. Security Council to pass a resolution enshrining the
demands recently agreed by the Group of Eight nations:
essentially, a withdrawal from Kosovo by Serb forces, the return
home of refugees escorted by an armed international peacekeeping
force under a UN mandate, and a political agreement to talk about
Kosovo autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, however, on Tuesday said the use of German ground
troops was not on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Britain and the U.S. Pentagon reportedly urged the
use of ground troops but the White House was reported to be deeply
concerned about possible troop losses.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder voiced great caution over the possible suspension of
NATO bombings, which he said might be decided by the U.N. at a
later stage.
</P>
<P>
"The Germans are following this process within the UN, during
this discussion it will be decided how and when to possibly put an
end to attacks for a limited time," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Belgrade, replying to a question on the D'Alema plan, the
Yugoslav foreign ministry said "all ideas and proposals to stop
the NATO bombings are welcome."

<HEADLINE> Italian Ruling Coalition's MPs Urge NATO Suspend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A parliamentary motion urging that
NATO should suspend its bombing raids in Kosovo as a prelude to a
meeting of the U.N. Security Council on the crisis was agreed by
Italy's center-left government majority here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The motion urges the government to push Italy's NATO allies for
drafting a Security Council resolution incorporating the Group of
Eight proposals and says the NATO attacks should be stopped to
facilitate this process.
</P>
<P>
"This suspension is aimed at allowing the Security Council to
be convened and the approval of a resolution and verification of
the Yugoslav government's willingness to accept it," said the
motion.
</P>
<P>
The motion was drawn up by Lower House floor-leaders.
</P>
<P>
According to the floor-leader of the Democrats, Rino
Piscitelli, the final draft states that the raids should be
suspended to "favor" the Security Council meeting.
</P>
<P>
Piscitelli said the center-left allies expect the motion to win
a majority in the Lower House vote.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Lends 115 Million Dollars to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced on
Tuesday that it will provide a total of 115 million U.S. dollars
in loans and credits to China to support the government in its
economic and structural reform effort and help China improve its
higher education.
</P>
<P>
The bank will provide a loan of 35 million dollars and a credit
of 10 million dollars to the Fourth Technical Cooperation Project,
which will provide continued support to the Chinese government in
its economic and structural reform effort.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, the project will support the government
by strengthening institutions that are key to China's ongoing
economic and structural reform agenda, developing selected
economic and structural reform programs which address priority
needs of China, and strengthening agencies involved in poverty
reduction and rural development, and improving the preparation of
projects in fostering sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
The other 70 million dollars, of which 50 million dollars will
be provided in loan and 20 million dollars in credit, will be used
to improve the quality and relevance of undergraduate basic
science and engineering programs in China.
</P>
<P>
The 28 project universities have each identified at least one
weak-performing partner university, disadvantaged by scarce
financial and human resources or by location in a poor area, and
have jointly developed collaborative programs to be undertaken
under the project.
</P>
<P>
The total number of partner institutions, which are integral to
the project design and content, will be at least 31, the bank
said.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Concerned About Downward Price Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Coping with downward price
pressure and fast-growing new competition are among the most
important marketplace challenges over the next year to chief
executives around the world.
</P>
<P>
In a survey of 656 CEOs conducted by the Conference Board, the
world's leading business membership and research organization,
more than two-thirds of those heading industrial manufacturing
firms and 55 percent of those leading consumer products companies
say that pressures on prices will be their major market challenge
over the next year.
</P>
<P>
The survey covers 550 CEOs in the Americas, 57 in Europe, 32 in
Japan and 17 in other parts of the world, said the Conference
Board which released findings Tuesday. The CEOs were asked to
identify their three top marketplace concerns and top three
management challenges.
</P>
<P>
The top management challenges for CEOs in the coming year are
finding ways to build customer loyalty, reduce costs, engage their
employees, and manage mergers, acquisitions or strategic
alliances. But customer loyalty is far more important among
American CEOs than it is among Europeans and the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
Among financial services firms, industry consolidation is the
most critical concern. Technology firms are more worried than
others about shortages of key skills, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
The surveyed CEOs feel besieged by new waves of competition.
Those of major firms see their markets being invaded by unexpected
competitors from virtually all parts of the world, from other
countries, established firms that shift their focus and new
upstarts that have fashioned entirely new industries.
</P>
<P>
While price and customer loyalty issues are causing high
anxiety in the West, the No.1 worry of CEOs in Japan is finding
ways to be more innovative. More than 60 percent of the Japanese
CEOs say that this has become their major challenge, against less
than 24 percent for all CEOs. Japanese business leaders also say
that changing technology and shifts in supply and distribution
systems are big concerns. For European CEOs, increasing
flexibility and speed are especially critical challenges.
</P>
<P>
Cost reduction is a significant concern of all CEOs, especially
in Japan. Nearly one-third of all CEOs say that engaging employees
in the company's vision and value systems has become one of their
most important management issues.
</P>
<P>
Competing for talent carries a much higher priority in American
firms. But in Japan, CEOs don't see a real problem in hiring the
talent they need.

<HEADLINE> N.Ireland's First Minister Insists on IRA Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's First Minister
David Trimble said on Tuesday he would refuse to set up a
power-sharing executive until the IRA began to disarm.
</P>
<P>
"No guns -- no government," said Trimble, underlining that
there would be no change to his long-held demand that the Irish
Republican Army (IRA) must disarm before its Sinn Fein political
wing could join the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
Trimble, also leader of the largest Protestant party Ulster
Unionist Party (UUP), told reporters in Belfast he had held talks
with senior members of his party and they had decided the party
needed clarification of the proposals put forward by the British
government last week.
</P>
<P>
The proposals commit Sinn Fein to strive to achieve disarmament
by May 2000, but do not specify that arms must be shed before Sinn
Fein enters the executive.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said he hoped the matter would be resolved
satisfactorily but it would take some time.
</P>
<P>
A British government spokesman said Prime Minister Tony Blair
would hold talks in London on Wednesday with Trimble and Sinn Fein
leader Gerry Adams.
</P>
<P>
Blair, anxious to get the peace process moving again, said on
Saturday he had set June 30 as an "absolute" deadline for the
launch of a power-sharing executive to run the province -- a key
part of the Good Friday accord.
</P>
<P>
IRA's political wing Sinn Fein has accepted the proposals that
emerged last Friday.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced on
Tuesday the approval of a total of 400 million U.S. dollars in
loan and credit for Indonesia to assist the government in
improving the management of water resources and reducing urban
poverty.
</P>
<P>
The loan, equivalent to 300 million dollars, will be used to
support a structural adjustment program of policy, institutional,
regulatory, legal, and organizational reforms in the management of
the water resources and irrigation sector, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The project will facilitate efficient environmentally and
socially sustainable water resources development and management and
strengthen the institutional and regulatory framework for
integrated and equitable river basin management.
</P>
<P>
It also will help the Indonesian government establish effective
regulatory institutions and implementation arrangements for water
pollution abatement and regional water quality management, as well
as improve the performance and sustainability of irrigation systems.
</P>
<P>
The credit, totaling 100 million dollars, will be used to
improve basic infrastructure in poor, urban neighborhoods and
promote sustainable income generation for its poor urban
residents, who are mostly long-term poor, have incomes eroded by
high inflation, or lost sources of income in the economic
downturn.
</P>
<P>
The project will also strengthen the capability of local
agencies to assist poor communities, the bank said.

<HEADLINE> Internet Impact on U.S. Retail Sales to Double by 2004 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The percentage of retail sales
generated from catalog and the Internet is expected to almost
double in the United States by 2004, according to a research
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Last year, catalogs and the Internet generated 3.46 percent of
total sales of almost 2.7 trillion U.S. dollars, said a report
from the Direct Marketing Association (DMA), the largest U.S.
trade association for businesses interested in interactive and
database marketing.
</P>
<P>
DMA projected catalog and Internet sales to grow annually 6.1
percent and 50.2 percent respectively from 1999 to 2004, while
total U.S. retail sales are growing 3.6 percent each year. As a
result, catalogs and the Internet are expected to account for 6.25
percent of total retail sales by 2004.
</P>
<P>
Catalog sales are expected to exceed 93 billion dollars in
1999, an increase from 1998 sales of 85 billion dollars. The
Internet is expected to generate 11 billion dollars in sales in
1999, up from 5.9 billion dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Consumers and businesses are taking advantage of the increasing
choices offered to them by the direct marketing community, from
companies that are selling from a combination of catalogs, the
Internet and brick-and-mortar stores, DMA said in the report. This
trend toward buying more from catalog and the Internet, DMA said,
reveals an opportunity for marketers, especially the 84 percent of
catalog companies that have a presence on the Web.
