Clinton Disbarment Recommended
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- An Arkansas Supreme Court committee decided Monday
that President Clinton should be disbarred for ''serious misconduct'' in the
Paula Jones case and began the court proceeding to strip him of his law license.
A majority of the panelists who met on Friday said the president should be
disciplined for denying a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during a
deposition he gave in the Jones sexual harassment case in January 1998. Clinton
attorney David Kendall said in a statement: ''This recommendation is wrong and
clearly contradicted by precedent.''

Fiji Leader Eyes Hostage Crisis End
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- In an attempt to bring armed rebels occupying Parliament
closer to surrender, Fiji's president said Monday that the current government
might be replaced even if the coup attempt fails. President Ratu Sir Kamisese
Mara's comments appeared to be a conciliatory sign to indigenous Fijian rebels,
who have been holding government officials hostage since storming Parliament on
Friday. In a meeting that Mara said he expected would help end the crisis,
indigenous tribal chiefs from across Fiji met Tuesday outside the capital of
Suva.

<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Incessant weekend rains triggered flooding and
mudslides that killed at least 21 people, including seven who died when a truck
was swept away, officials said Monday. Televised images showed residents in
several affected areas paddling down streets in canoes or wading in knee-deep,
muddy brown water. Hundreds of families will have to be relocated, national
disaster relief coordinator Eduardo Jose Gonzalez said. Meteorologists predicted
more heavy rains ahead.

   HOUSTON (AP) -- The admitted railroad killer who made the FBI's 10 Most
Wanted List was sentenced to death today for killing a Houston-area doctor, one
of nine murders he was accused of committing. The jury that convicted Angel
Maturino Resendiz of capital murder last week met for just less than two hours
before deciding on the death sentence. The panel could have sentenced the
Mexican drifter to life in prison. He had asked for the death penalty.

   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Atlantis' astronauts floated into
the international space station tonight to replace dying batteries. American
astronaut Susan Helms and Russian cosmonaut Yuri Usachev led the way through a
dark vestibule into the brightly lit Unity module. Upon entering the station
from the joined shuttle, the seven crew members took air samples and tested the
carbon-dioxide level to make sure it was safe. No one had ventured inside the
station in a full year.

Antibodies Show Promise Vs. Cancer
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A new approach to fighting cancer that involves
harnessing radioactive antibodies could turn out to be the first effective
treatment for an invariably fatal form of lymphoma that strikes about 20,000
Americans a year. Doctors caution that it will take several years to prove the
treatment truly slows or cures the disease, but early signs are promising. The
treatment is one of a new generation of cancer therapies that attempt to exploit
the genetic and biological peculiarities of malignant cells to kill them while
sparing normal tissue.

Clintons Host Dinner for Mbeki

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stepping away from the debate over AIDS treatment and
prevention, President Clinton played host Monday night at a state dinner for
South African President Thabo Mbeki and declared, ''A great deal unites South
Africa and the United States.'' The lavish affair for 360 guests, featuring a
performance by pianist Awadagin Pratt, turned the White House into a sparkling
blend of summer colors. It marked Mbeki's first visit to Washington since
succeeding Nelson Mandela as president. Clinton pledged continued work towards
peace in the continent, hailing ''the promise of South Africa, the promise that
will always join our two people.''

<HEADLINE> Dissident Assembly Democrat plead for change  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State Assemblywoman Barbara Clark has tried
for three years to get a bill prohibiting predatory lending
practices targeting senior citizens passed.
</P>
<P>
   The Queens Democrat said she has yet to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm told, 'Yes, we're going to get it done,' but we always
wait until the end of the session, when the Senate is closed down
and we don't get it done,'' said Clark, who heads the Assembly
committee on aging.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's complaint was just one of several voiced at an Albany
news conference Monday, where she and nineteen other Assembly
Democrats stood with former majority leader Michael Bragman to
rally against Speaker Sheldon Silver's leadership of the chamber
and method of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   ''Absolute power corrupts,'' Clark said. ''We have to exercise
our power as state legislators that were given by the people who
elected us.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers said they had formed a Democratic Majority Reform
Caucus to act as a permanent agent for change in the Assembly
following the demise of Bragman's own personal challenge against
Silver for the speakership.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Assembly simply can't continue as a one-person
operation,'' said Nettie Mayersohn of Queens, referring to what
critics call the secretive and autocratic ruling style by Silver.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question that a majority of members, whether
they're here or not here, agree with us,'' she said. ''Those of us
who are here are willing to stand up and say what we believe, that
the system needs to be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Silver, the legislators' supposed preferential access to
the speaker is a ''joke,'' said Stephen Kaufman of the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is outrageous and outlandish, for a manager to run a
conference with absolutely no access to him,'' Kaufman said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that lobbyists often bypass Assembly members and head
straight to Silver, whom they perceive to have the final say in
passing legislation anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many times you see strangers walking in and out of the office
and we sit and languish somewhere in the lobby,'' Kaufman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each one of us is elected as an equal partner in this
Assembly,'' added Westchester County Democrat Sandra Galef. ''We
need equal respect ... Nobody is better than the other Assembly
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luster of Tompkins County complained that there is also a
lack of communication between Silver and his members. Luster said
legislators are often called in at the last minute to stand behind
the speaker like ''ornaments on a Christmas tree'' to show support
for a policy that they sometimes didn't even know about.
</P>
<P>
   Members not only need to be aware of what's going on, they need
to have a say in the process, said Joan Christensen. The Syracuse
assemblywoman said lawmakers with expertise in a specific field are
sometimes kept out of participating in that issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not just here to sit and say 'yes' on issues that we
vehemently disagree on,'' Christensen said.
</P>
<P>
   James Brennan of Brooklyn agreed and said members should have
opportunities to bring issues to the floor, where ''consensus and
collegiality have collapsed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic conference includes members from diverse
philosophical backgrounds and ''they all have something to give,
but they can't,'' said Anthony Seminerio of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're looking for is be part of the system,'' Seminerio
said.
</P>
<P>
   Carmen Arroyo said she was a good example. When she was first
elected to her post six years ago, the Bronx assemblywoman said she
felt ''proud and so happy because I was coming here to Albany
represent the Hispanic woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, ''I'm frustrated,'' Arroyo said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't treat me like a legislator here,'' she said. ''When
I ask questions, the questions are never answered.''
</P>
<P>
   Seminerio said Silver should give members ''the respect as
elected officials for our constituency.''
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter what's going to happen today, I believe the powers
to be has gotten the message,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Silver survives leadership plebiscite in Assembly  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Sheldon Silver will remain speaker of the
state Assembly despite a formal challenge to his position by his
deposed second-in-command and a remarkable public excoriation of
his manner of running the Assembly by several fellow Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Silver survived a vote Monday which would have exposed him to an
immediate ballot for power from chief challenger Michael Bragman,
63-85, or by 13 votes in the 149-member Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The voting ended a tense, emotional day at the Capitol in which
Bragman, former Assembly majority leader, followed through on
threats to take his resolution seeking to oust Silver to the floor,
despite his probable ruination as a politician. Many of his
''heroic'' partisans were risking the same thing, Bragman said.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman predicted they would be vindicated someday by history.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints about Silver, who is from Manhattan, have focused
around his supposed aloof attitude toward Democratic colleagues'
concerns and refusal to give them a more meaningful role in
legislation in the Assembly and in annual state budget
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman had once hoped to secure the 50 votes needed among the
98 Democratic members of the house to win the speakership outright.
But he said Monday he had transformed his overthrow-Silver effort
into a reform-the-Assembly movement which he predicted would lead
to the same result.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman blamed cut-throat tactics by Silver, threatening
Democrats with tough primary challenges and redrawn district lines
in 2002, with ''winning'' many of them over to the speaker's side.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Bragman got 19 Assembly Democrats, including
himself, to vote in his favor. They were joined by 44 minority
Republicans. Seventy-eight Democrats voted with Silver.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after the vote, Bragman proclaimed that the ''speaker is
fatally wounded.''
</P>
<P>
   In a dramatic 15-minute address before a jammed and tense
chamber, Bragman accused Silver of letting lobbyists and
non-elected staff members control legislation in the Assembly
instead of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has been listening for years to members complain
about how hard it is to even see Silver face-to-face.
</P>
<P>
   He contended the conference committees by which small portions
of the last three state budgets were negotiated have been shams
controlled by legislative leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman even said, ''It is wrong to treat the members from the
minority side with such disrespect.'' Republicans in the Assembly --
like Democrats in the Republican-dominated state Senate -- have
essentially no input on legislation and usually cannot even ''sign
on'' to Democratic bills as sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not about my personal ambition,'' Bragman said. ''It
could not have been with so many involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragman, who is from Syracuse's northern suburbs, was stripped
of his majority leader's job and perks when he went public last
week with his challenge against Silver. He received a standing
ovation from the 51 Republicans in the Assembly and from his
Democratic allies while the other Democrats sat frozen in their
chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Silver, who has been silent as he and his allies have worked to
solidify his leadership post, said he would talk to reporters today
about his battle with Bragman.
</P>
<P>
   But many Silver allies rebutted Bragman's accusations Monday in
the Assembly in the course of a three-hour debate in which
Democrats aired much of their dirty laundry publicly, contrary to
the habits of a group which airs its dirty laundry in private
Democrats-only conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Brodsky, a Democrat from Westchester County, said the
measure before the chamber ''isn't the vehicle'' and Bragman
''isn't the man'' to address the complaints against Silver.
</P>
<P>
   ''The notion that unreturned phone calls or inappropriate staff
acts -- which will happen, under anyone -- are grounds for
impeachment, is ludicrous,'' Brodsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Clarence Norman, the Brooklyn Democratic leader and
the deputy majority leader, said the Bragman forces ''failed
miserably'' to meet their burden of proving why Silver should not
remain speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ''I say you change leadership when institutions are paralyzed
with corruption or blatant incompetency,'' said Norman, rumored to
be one of Bragman's possible successors, ''and certainly no one can
say our Speaker Sheldon Silver is incompetent or corrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Assemblyman Arthur Eve, a Silver backer who was first
elected in 1966, urged the dissidents to back down and work with
Silver to resolve their problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't destroy this institution,'' he pleaded.
</P>
<P>
   A close Silver partisan, Assemblyman Herman Farrell of
Manhattan, predicted that Republicans would use the disharmony
among Assembly Democrats to their advantage against Democratic
candidates this November.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't find the words here to make it go away,'' Farrell
said. ''It needs to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   A Bragman ally, Martin Luster of Tompkins County, was one of two
insurgents so far to be penalized by Silver. Both he and Ronald
Tocci of Westchester County lost their committee chairmanships and
$12,500-a-year stipends for joining Bragman's team.
</P>
<P>
   Luster said he is a ''big boy'' and understands there are
penalties to pay for being on the wrong side of a coup against a
political leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I am not willing to accept the notion that with our vote
today that this house is in good order, that we run it as a
democratic institution,'' Luster said.

<HEADLINE> Lazio wants debates; gets backing of Conservative leader  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Rep. Rick Lazio, the new Republican Senate
candidate facing Hillary Rodham Clinton, says he is looking forward
to debates against the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope we have a number of different forums where the public
gets to see the unvarnished candidates. Where we can spar on the
issues and we can hold each other accountable,'' the Long Island
congressman said at a news conference following a GOP rally for him
at the Albany airport.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who had agreed to debates against former Republican
Senate candidate Rudolph Giuliani, has said through her aides that
she will go ahead with those debates against Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City mayor withdrew from the race on Friday to deal
with his prostate cancer. Lazio, with the backing of Gov. George
Pataki, quickly jumped into the contest.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Clinton and Lazio each picked up crucial endorsements
-- the first lady won the backing of the state Liberal Party leader
and the Republican congressman gained the support of the
Conservative Party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other states, New York allows major party candidates to
also count votes from third-party ballot lines, which can be
critical in a close race.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican has been elected to statewide office in New York
since 1974 without Conservative Party backing, and no Democrat has
been elected governor or senator in New York without Liberal Party
backing since the party was founded in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Conservative Party, Michael Long, had refused to
get behind Giuliani because of his support for abortion rights and
his closeness to the Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, while maintaining he is an abortion rights supporter,
favors banning the late-term abortion procedure that critics call
''partial-birth abortion'' and has never run with Liberal Party
backing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be a real race. The difference is there's going
to be a contrast here,'' Long said Monday. ''There's going to be a
united front. Old alliances are going to be working together
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Party leader Raymond Harding has been a top political
adviser to Giuliani, and the mayor's withdrawal from the race
cleared the way for Harding to get behind Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsements came as Lazio continued a two-day whirlwind
tour of upstate New York designed to boost his name recognition
quickly in a large state where he is little known. He had stopped
in Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Binghamton on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   After stops in Elmira, Watertown and the Utica area, Lazio was
joined for the airport rally Monday in Albany by Pataki, state
Republican Chairman William Powers and more than 300 cheering
supporters, many of them carrying hand-lettered signs that
reflected the rapidity with which the campaign has been put
together.
</P>
<P>
   Noting Lazio had appeared on all the major Sunday morning news
shows while the first lady has done none of them, Pataki told the
cheering Lazio supporters that ''this is a man who shined on
television yesterday, 12 hours into the campaign. His opponent, 12
months into a campaign, doesn't have the guts to show up and answer
those questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, at an appearance at the Westchester County GOP
headquarters, Lazio was asked if he hoped Giuliani would use all or
part of the $9 million he still has in his Senate campaign account
to help the congressman's campaign. Lazio said he hoped the mayor
would ''do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Teitelbaum, Giuliani's Senate campaign manager, said he
had met Monday afternoon with three Lazio campaign aides to discuss
''our campaign structure and how we can be helpful.'' Teitelbaum
said the subject of the mayor's Senate campaign money wasn't
discussed and was still being reviewed by Giuliani's team.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign quickly used Long's backing of Lazio to
press a favorite new theme of the first lady's team -- that Lazio is
too conservative for New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given his conservative record, it's not surprising he would
get the Conservative Party nod,'' Clinton campaign spokesman Howard
Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, on the other hand, told The Associated Press in an
interview that the Liberal Party backing was ''predictable. Hillary
Clinton is a liberal ... This will be a race between somebody on
the far left and somebody in the center.'' He said his backing by
Long ''reflects the unity of this campaign ... the momentum of this
campaign.''

<HEADLINE> Clean air vs. water quality weighed in debate over MTBE bill  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Gov. George Pataki must decide tomorrow
whether to ban MTBE, a chemical added to gasoline that is blamed
for contaminating water supplies even as it prevents air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's office on Monday would not comment on the bill approved
by both houses of the Legislature. The governor has said he prefers
a federal approach to the MTBE -- or methyl tertiary butyl ether --
problem, but is ''taking a look'' at the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, lobbying efforts have intensified on either side of
an issue so thorny it has put the American Lung Association in the
unusual position of opposing a bill that could protect the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know our position makes us as popular as a skunk at an
environmentalists' garden party,'' said Peter Iwanowicz, director
of environmental health for the American Lung Association's New
York chapter.
</P>
<P>
   The group says that banning MTBE without other safeguards would
''present an unacceptable risk of increased air pollution.'' The
lung association also said that if Congress doesn't act, a phase
out in New York may be appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the American Lung Association, a coalition of other
states' environmental officials want to let the federal government
handle the issue. The Citizens Campaign for the Environment, on the
other hand, is pushing for Pataki to sign.
</P>
<P>
   ''MTBE has become one of the most prominent contaminants in
groundwater and surface waters in New York and across the nation,''
Sarah Meyland, the Citizens Campaign for the Environment's
executive director, said in a statement. A ban would ''set an
important example for other states ... and ultimately, this will
force the federal government to address the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, which
includes officials from Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Vermont, is also opposed to
the bill before Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is unnecessary and unacceptable to improve water quality at
the cost of undermining clean air and public health,'' the group
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   That group also said the use of ethanol in the summer would
increase air pollution. Both MTBE and ethanol make gasoline burn
cleaner by adding oxygen. But ethanol also has drawbacks -- it can
erode ozone.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Citizens Campaign for the Environment on Monday
displayed the names of 25,000 residents who support a ban.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see no downside to signing this bill,'' said Robert Foster,
legislative director of Citizens Campaign for the Environment. ''My
understanding is (MTBE) is not as effective as intended. The clean
air benefits are not that well documented.'' Foster also suggested
that not banning MTBE would essentially be yielding to the oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
   MTBE is used in one-third of gasoline sold in the United States,
primarily in areas with smog problems. It has leaked in areas
across New York state but Long Island has been a noted trouble
spot. Several counties in and around New York City are required to
use such oxygenated gas.
</P>
<P>
   A European study in the mid-1990s linked MTBE to liver and
kidney tumors in mice. The danger to humans is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   California -- the nation's No. 1 user of MTBE -- has banned MTBE
by the end of 2002. An Environmental Protection Agency panel has
recommended strengthening programs to reduce MTBE's presence in
drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Department of Environmental Conservation has listed
about 1,700 MTBE spills around the state, although not all the
spills have contaminated water supplies. The DEC did not
immediately comment on its recommendation to the governor.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, New York's legislation would go into effect Jan. 1,
2004.

<HEADLINE> Lazio defends opposition to funding for poor women's abortions  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Newly minted Republican Senate candidate
Rick Lazio, defending a position at odds with GOP Gov. George
Pataki and Democratic rival Hillary Rodham Clinton, opposes
Medicaid funding to pay for poor women's abortions.
</P>
<P>
   While the Long Island congressman said he is an abortion rights
supporter, he has repeatedly voted in the House against Medicaid
funding for abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am what I am. I'm not going to hide anything here,'' Lazio
said Monday in an interview with The Associated Press. ''I have had
a record that supports a woman's right to choose. I do not want to
criminalize abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the other hand, I want to make it rarer and I don't think
just because we have a right that we need to subsidize that
right,'' he added. ''I'm absolutely comfortable with that position.
I think that's where the majority of New Yorkers are.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that Pataki, his main political booster, has continued
state Medicaid funding for poor women's abortions despite the
cutoff of federal funding, Lazio said that ''just like a lot of
different rights that we don't subsidize, I think it falls into
that category. I just think my record speaks for itself. I'm very
comfortable with it. People will make a judgment based on it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to opposing Medicaid funding for abortion, Lazio is
in favor of banning a late-term abortion procedure that critics
call ''partial-birth abortion.'' It is his opposition to that
procedure that helped clear the way Monday for Lazio to pick up the
backing of state Conservative Party Chairman Michael Long.
</P>
<P>
   Long had refused to get behind the now-ended Senate candidacy of
Republican Rudolph Giuliani in large part because of the New York
City mayor's refusal to oppose the abortion procedure. Giuliani
left the Senate race Friday and Lazio immediately declared his
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign wasted no time in jumping on the abortion
issue Monday after being told about Lazio's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ''New Yorkers will learn that Rick Lazio isn't really
pro-choice. He is multiple choice and never met an abortion
restriction he didn't like or vote for,'' Clinton campaign
spokesman Howard Wolfson said. ''Women in New York will learn that
they can't really trust him to protect the right to choose.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelli Conlin, executive director of the New York arm of the
National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, said the
polls she has seen indicate most New Yorkers believe ''we shouldn't
be drawing lines based on income.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I would disagree with him that most New Yorkers believe that
only wealthy women should have access to abortion,'' the abortion
rights advocate said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Woman details relationship with man who allegedly killed her husband </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOCKPORT, N.Y. (AP) -- Michael Northrup gave Annette Montstream a
detailed account of her husband's death a day after pulling the
trigger at her request, Montstream testified at Northrup's murder
trial.
</P>
<P>
   With her husband's body still undetected in a Niagara Falls
parking ramp, Montstream learned he had been shot once in the head
as he spoke with Northrup in his minivan, Montstream said.
</P>
<P>
   ''At one point my husband turned to look out the window and
that's when Michael shot him in the back of the head,'' she said
Northrup told her. ''It went through his forehead. He fell back.''
</P>
<P>
   John Montstream's decomposing body was found June 30, 1998, in
his minivan in a Niagara Falls parking ramp, where Northrup
allegedly drove him after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Annette Montstream, 41, is awaiting sentencing after pleading
guilty to first-degree manslaughter and agreeing to testify against
Northrup.
</P>
<P>
   Northrup, 29, of Caledonia in Livingston County, is charged with
second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Northrup ''told me he loved me, he cared about me, that he would
be a better husband to me,'' Montstream testified Monday in Niagara
County Court.
</P>
<P>
   ''I asked him if he would kill my husband,'' she said. ''He said
he would take care of it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Peter Broderick denied repeated motions by Northrup's
attorney, John Parrinello, for a mistrial over Niagara County
prosecutor Tim Lundquist's questioning of Montstream.
</P>
<P>
   Annette Montstream called police June 23, 1998, to report her
husband missing. She told police he had failed to return to their
Clarkson home, west of Rochester, after leaving to return a rented
videotape. However, she soon fell under suspicion after referring
to her husband in the past tense during a press conference, hinting
she knew he was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Montstream later admitted she asked Northrup to kill her husband
of 15 years because he would not grant her a divorce. John
Montstream, she said, had insisted on trying to save the marriage.
The couple had two children.
</P>
<P>
   On the stand, Montstream detailed her relationship with
Northrup, who worked in the Greece-Ridge Center Mall with her and
would often come to her store after hours to talk and help her.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the two had been intimate, she said they had
''just kissed.''
</P>
<P>
   On the night he was killed, John Montstream agreed to meet
Northrup, whom he knew, and the two spoke inside Montstream's van,
Annette Montstream said. She said Northrup recounted the shooting
to her the following day.
</P>
<P>
   Northrup and Montstream only occasionally looked at each other
during Monday's testimony. Neither showed any emotion.

<HEADLINE> Viagra Fails Test To Help Women  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Viagra has failed its first big test in women,
according to a study paid for by Pfizer Inc., maker of the
anti-impotence drug.
</P>
<P>
   The study findings, being presented today at the American
College of Obstetrics &AMP; Gynecology meeting in San Francisco,
confirmed smaller preliminary tests that also showed the little
blue pill did not help women with sexual dysfunctions, such as
difficulty getting aroused.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra, the first ever pill to treat impotence was an instant
splash in 1998 when it was approved in the United States to help
men. The pill had more than $1 billion in sales last year, and
Pfizer Inc. hoped to increase its profits by getting doctors to
prescribe it to women.
</P>
<P>
   The latest study, conducted by University of British Columbia
researchers, marks the biggest study to date of women taking
Viagra. In the study of 583 women with various sexual disorders,
Viagra did only about as well as a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 percent to 50 percent of women in the study said they
were helped by Viagra - the results varied by dosage. About 43
percent of women who took the placebo, or sugar pill, also said
they were helped. The study's author concluded Viagra appeared safe
in women, but it failed to show any statistical significance over a
placebo in improving sexual response.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-week study was double blinded, so neither the
participants or the doctors, knew if women were getting Viagra or a
placebo.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven A. Kaplan, vice chairman of the department of Urology
at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, said the
findings were not surprising and confirm those of his own study of
33 women last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This matches our published study and our clinical
experience,'' he said. ''Hopefully Viagra may still help a small
group of women with sexual problems,'' but it will take more study.
</P>
<P>
   A Pfizer spokeswoman said the company will continue to conduct
more testing of Viagra in women.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary Basson, associate professor gynecology and psychology
at the University of British Columbia, who headed the study, said
studying sexual arousal is more difficult in women than in men. She
said there is still a possibility Viagra may help women with
certain types of sexual arousal problems who lack enough blood flow
to the genital area.

<HEADLINE> Man Pleads Guilty In Vanover Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A Kansas City man pleaded guilty Monday
to a federal charge that he helped former Chiefs kick returner
Tamarick Vanover move a stolen vehicle from Missouri to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Norbert G. Scarlett, 27, was charged in late February with
helping Vanover transport the Ford Expedition from Kansas City to a
buyer in Tallahassee, Fla. The vehicle was stolen from a Kansas
City Ford dealership.
</P>
<P>
   Vanover pleaded guilty in February to aiding and assisting in
the sale of the sport-utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Vanover, who is cooperating with a drug investigation involving
former Chiefs player Bam Morris, was cut by Kansas City after it
was revealed he admitted to an FBI agent that he gave $40,000 to
Morris to buy drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Sentencing hearings for Scarlett and Vanover are pending.

<HEADLINE> Padres 1, Mets 0  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Ruben Rivera's single with one out in the
eighth inning broke a scoreless tie and Matt Clement snapped a
personal three-game losing streak as the San Diego Padres beat New
York 1-0 Monday night, ending the Mets' four-game winning string.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets loaded the bases with one out in the ninth against
Trevor Hoffman. But Jay Payton popped up on a 3-1 pitch and
pinch-hitter Mark Johnson flied out to end it.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Owens hit a one-out single off John Franco (1-1) and, after
several pickoff attempts, stole second. Rivera singled to left and
Owens slid home headfirst ahead of the throw from Joe McEwing.
</P>
<P>
   Clement (5-3) held the Mets scoreless on three hits through
eight innings, striking out six and walking one. Hoffman got his
eighth save.
</P>
<P>
   Mets starter Glendon Rusch threw seven scoreless innings, struck
out four and walked two.
</P>
<P>
   Baserunning blunders cost the Padres two runs in the first
inning. Owens reached on a strikeout-wild pitch but was picked off
with Rivera at bat.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera then tripled into the right-center field gap. Rivera was
too far off the bag when Tony Gwynn hit a broken-bat grounder to
Ventura, and the third baseman tagged Rivera for the second out.
Phil Nevin singled and Ed Sprague ended the inning with a fly out.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets lost the chance to take the lead when Ventura was
thrown out trying to score on Clement's wild pitch in the fourth.
Clement's pitch sailed over catcher Carlos Hernandez, who snared
the ball after it rebounded off the seats directly behind home and
threw it to Clement, who tagged Ventura for the third out.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Mets OF Melvin Mora began a rehabilitation assignment
Monday night with Triple-A Norfolk. Placed on the DL with a cut on
his right index finger on May 13, he's eligible to be activated on
Sunday. ... Padres RHP Carlton Loewer pitched a three-inning
simulated game of about 60 pitches and likely will begin a rehab
assignment on Friday. Loewer began the season on the disabled list
with a broken left ankle suffered when he fell out of a deer blind
while hunting in January. ... Nevin was named NL Player of the Week
after hitting .667 (14-for-21) with three doubles, a triple and
four homers, including his first career grand slam. He drove in 14
runs and scored seven runs. ... Gwynn was back in the lineup after
sitting out two games due to his troublesome left knee.

   METULLA, Israel (AP) -- Israeli troops pulled out of their second-largest
base in southern Lebanon overnight, quickening the pace of their withdrawal.
Convoys of Israeli soldiers drove out of Lebanon at daybreak in tanks and jeeps
Tuesday, honking horns, waving brigade banners and kissing the soil of their
homeland. The army described the predawn departure from the Bint Jabail -- one
of its Lebanon headquarters, in the western sector of Israel's rapidly emptying
''security zone'' -- as orderly. Some young soldiers called their mothers to let

<HEADLINE> Forstmann gives out more scholarships  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Ted Forstmann, the
millionaire-would-be-U.S.-Senate-candidate, isn't running after
all, but he is making an impact on public policy just the same.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street financier on Monday gave partial scholarships to
7,500 New York City children who want to attend parochial and
private schools and said he was starting a movement to put parents
in charge of their children's education.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't do this from the United States Senate,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Forstmann and John Walton, heir to the Wal-Mart
fortune, launched the Children's Scholarship Fund and awarded
partial private-school scholarships to 40,000 children around the
country, including 2,000 from New York. The additional 7,500
recipients were chosen randomly from the waiting list for last
year's grants.
</P>
<P>
   The average scholarship award is $1,300; parents must pay the
balance of tuition. While tuition at New York's exclusive private
schools can run $15,000 or more, most of the recipients of these
grants go to neighborhood parochial schools where tuition averages
$2,570 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Forstmann was mentioned as a potential Republican candidate in
the days leading up to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's departure from the
Senate race. But now Forstmann says he never seriously considered
running for office.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he wants to ''lead a movement for parents' rights that
will put them back in charge of their children's education. We are
going to devote very, very substantial resources so that the
candidates hear our message.''
</P>
<P>
   Forstmann's concept includes using the government ''like an ATM
machine'' to collect money from citizens. He acknowledged this
would not differ much from paying taxes, and said: ''I dare say
we'd be happy to pay higher taxes to get a real education.''
</P>
<P>
   The money would be disbursed at a standard rate for tuition at
schools of the parents' choice.
</P>
<P>
   Forstmann said elementary education should be supplied like
college -- by a multitude of institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Parents will have the freedom to choose among these many new
providers, and those education providers will have to compete to
give the best possible education,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He called public schools ''a government-run monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   Forstmann insisted his plan differs from vouchers because it is
more far-reaching.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you keep the present model and issue a few vouchers, all
you do is take a few kids out of one system, and the only place
they can go is these religious schools,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Lyons, a spokeswoman for the National Education
Association, the Washington-based union for teachers in public
schools, said: ''It seems a little disingenuous to say he's against
vouchers when it sounds like that's what he's talking about. A
voucher is a voucher is a voucher.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ''Anyone who's attacking the public schools isn't
looking at what's going on in the last 20 years. There's a
tremendous record of success -- dropout rates are down, graduation
rates are up, there has been a jump in SAT scores.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the NEA endorses ''the idea of people being able to go
to private schools. We object to the government paying for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Monaco, a spokeswoman for the Children's Scholarship
Fund, disagreed with Lyons' assertions about the success rates of
public schools. She cited David Kearns' book ''The Legacy of
Learning,'' which says that the average achievement of high school
students on most standardized tests has declined over 25 years and
that ''the College Board's SATs demonstrate a virtually unbroken
decline from 1963 to 1980.''
</P>
<P>
   Forstmann, who was himself educated in private schools, has no
children, although he sponsors the care and education of two South
African orphans. He is a major supporter of the Catholic
Archdiocese of New York.

<HEADLINE> Jury awards former basketball star $15.8 million for accident  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A former University of Bridgeport basketball
star has been awarded more than $15.8 million for injuries he
received after falling from a ladder while working at the World
Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   A Manhattan jury awarded the money to Mark Butigian, 37, of
Queens, who has had three spinal surgeries because of the accident
and still might have to undergo a fourth operation and physical
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Butigian's lawyer, David Breitbart, said on Monday that his
client was injured Feb. 3, 1995, when he fell 12 feet while trying
to remove air ducts from a ceiling in an office that was being
remodeled in the Trade Center's Tower No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was pulling on this piece of duct work, about five feet in
length,'' said Butigian, who worked for Computer Cool. ''It came
loose, and my ladder went one way and I hit the floor. My arms and
back were all cut up.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I was in shock,'' the 6-foot-8 former athlete said, recalling
how he felt lying on the floor before being taken to St. Vincent's
Hospital. ''I was sick to my stomach. I felt dizzy, and tingling in
my back. It was bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Breitbart said Computer Cool should have given Butigian a type
of scaffold that would have prevented his fall instead of a ladder.
</P>
<P>
   After a month-long trial, the jury in Manhattan's State Supreme
Court awarded Butigian, who has not worked since the accident,
$12.5 million for lost earnings and pain and suffering. His wife,
Marilyn Butigian, was awarded $3.37 million for loss of his
companionship and services.
</P>
<P>
   The Butigians have a daughter, 5, and a son, 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants are the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey, owners of the World Trade Center; Guy Carpenter Inc., the
insurance company in whose offices Butigian was working; and John
Gallin &AMP; Sons Inc., the contractor who hired Computer Cool to
remove the air ducts.
</P>
<P>
   Computer Cool installs and removes cooling systems in computer
rooms. Butigian could not sue Computer Cool, his employer, because
of state workmen's compensation rules.
</P>
<P>
   Port Authority spokesman Allen Morrison said the work was
contracted for by the tenant, Guy Carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any verdict awarded because of the accident would be paid by
the tenant's insurance company,'' Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyer, James Gilroy, did not return calls for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Butigian said he is in constant pain and is unable to sleep more
than three or four hours a day because of the severe discomfort. He
said he takes painkillers several times a day.
</P>
<P>
   Butigian, a 1981 graduate of Archbishop Molloy High School in
New York City, made All-City teams for four years while a student
there, his lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Bridgeport, in Connecticut, he achieved the
third-highest single-game point total in the school's history, his
lawyer said. A teammate at the university was Manute Bol, formerly
of the Golden State Warriors.

<HEADLINE> 3 Hostages Freed in Fiji Crisis  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Armed rebels holding Fiji's government captive
in parliament released three hostages Tuesday, local radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawmaker Michael Columbus, who was suffering from the
effects of diabetes, and two doctors held since Saturday when they
entered parliament to treat Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, were
allowed out late Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said Columbus was helped into a car and driven away.
</P>
<P>
   The release came as tribal chiefs from across Fiji met to try to
resolve the five-day crisis that began when armed indigenous
Fijians stormed parliament and took the Pacific nation's ethnic
Indian-led elected government hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Police and soldiers cordoned off the meeting Tuesday of the
Great Council of Chiefs -- the supreme body of indigenous Fijian
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry, Fiji's first prime minister of Indian descent, is
among the hostages in this South Pacific country where ethnic
tensions have been building in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara said Monday that the current
government might be replaced even if the coup attempt fails --
comments that appeared to be a conciliatory sign to the rebels.
Mara said he would hold talks with the democratically elected
government once the coup attempt ends.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will have a dialogue and see what they offer,'' he said.
''I cannot say I will put back the government that has caused all
these problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Sitiveni Rabuka, the president of the council, said he
supported Mara.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry's position ''now is untenable,'' Rabuka said. ''If he
feels for the country and he sees the demonstrations and the
destruction, he might feel that he wants to step down.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabuka, who led two coups and ruled for 12 years, said he
supports the aims of the armed rebels holding more than 20 Cabinet
ministers and lawmakers hostage, ''but not their methods.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebel leader George Speight on Monday renewed a threat to harm
the hostages if an armed rescue mission was mounted, reversing a
safety guarantee he gave Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If anyone enters the barriers of this complex with the view to
free them (the hostages) we will not hesitate,'' he said. ''Their
safety is conditional upon everybody staying out of this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Speight confirmed earlier reports that rebels had taken Chaudhry
outside into the grounds of parliament at gunpoint. He said it was
in response to an alleged attempt by an unknown group to enter the
compound.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said no rescue mission had been launched.

   Speight claims Chaudhry's year-old coalition discriminated
against indigenous Fijians. Tensions have been rising between the
indigenous people and the descendants of Indian migrants, who
dominate commerce in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Mara sent a letter to Speight on Sunday night promising to

   Fijians of Indian descent make up about 44 percent of Fiji's

<P>
   The president said he had a plan to end the standoff, which
would be presented Tuesday to the Great Council of Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our main objective is to see that no blood is spilled,'' Mara
said.
</P>
<P>
   Speight said he would ''retire'' if the council doesn't back his
coup attempt. Local media also reported he said he would release
his hostages if the council orders it.
</P>
<P>
   The failed businessman declared himself prime minister after
storming parliament with seven gunmen and swearing in a replacement
government.
</P>
<P>
   Police on Monday tightened security around Suva's parliament
complex, stopping news crews at checkpoints and searching vans
delivering food and other supplies.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Stanley Roth urged Fiji to
reinstall its democratically elected government and said if the
chiefs did not, the U.S. relationship with Fiji would deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   ''This meeting could play a major positive role in leading
toward a resolution of this crisis and the preservation of the
constitutionally elected government,'' Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the government were to be toppled by force, U.S. law would
require policy changes and again put the relationship on a downward
path and I think, the biggest losers would be the people of Fiji.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, New Zealand Foreign Minister Phil Goff announced
the United Nations was sending the head of the U.N. administration
in East Timor, Sergio Vieira de Mello, to Fiji to mediate in the
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Thai Boy Reunited With Grandparents  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The 2-year-old boy authorities say was caught
in a human smuggling ring has been reunited with his paternal
grandparents from Thailand, who are in the process of adopting him.
</P>
<P>
   Phanupong Khaisri had a quiet, private reunion with Boonlue
Khaisri and his wife on Monday after their arrival at Los Angeles
International Airport, said Hae Jung Cho, project director for the
Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing was scheduled Tuesday before U.S. District Court Judge
Dickran Tevrizian, and Cho said her group would insist that
Phanupong stay in the United States until he can receive a medical
evaluation and his grandparents are evaluated for their fitness to
act as his parents.
</P>
<P>
   The boy arrived at Los Angeles International Airport on April 11
with a man and a woman. Immigration officials took him into custody
after determining that he was being used as a prop by the man, who
they said was trying to smuggle the woman into the country under
the guise that all three were a family.
</P>
<P>
   His mother has said she thought he was sightseeing with friends.
However, Thai officials have found her unfit for custody.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials had planned to quickly deport Phanupong to
his native country, saying Thai officials would make sure he was
well cared for upon his return. But local advocacy groups went to
court to keep him in the United States until his grandparents
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   They said they wanted to make sure he didn't fall into
smugglers' hands again and Tevrizian agreed.

<HEADLINE> Famous Isolated Phone Booth Removed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAKER, Calif. (AP) -- Time's up: The world's loneliest pay phone
has been removed.
</P>
<P>
   The phone booth stood for decades in the middle of nowhere, deep
within the Mojave National Preserve. But Pacific Bell and the
National Park Service said they had to remove the phone Wednesday
because it was attracting too many curiosity-seekers.
</P>
<P>
   ''While the phone and its location proved to be a novelty for
some in recent months, the increased public traffic had a negative
impact on the desert environment in the nation's newest national
park,'' they said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The phone was installed in the 1960s for use by miners digging
volcanic cinder nearby. It began attracting attention on the
Internet about three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   People routinely dialed the number from all over the world just
to see if someone would answer. Often someone did, usually
passers-by who were equally curious about who was on the other end.
</P>
<P>
   All that remains is a concrete pad.

<HEADLINE> Antibodies Show Promise Vs. Cancer  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Using a new approach, researchers say
radioactive antibodies are showing early promise in treating an
invariably fatal form of lymphoma that strikes about 20,000
Americans a year.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors caution that it will take several years to prove the
treatment truly slows or cures the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment is one of a new generation of cancer therapies
that attempt to exploit the genetic and biological peculiarities of
malignant cells to kill them while sparing normal tissue.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest study, released Monday at a meeting of the
American Society of Clinical Oncology, doctors tested an approach
called radioimmunotherapy against victims of low-grade, or
follicular, lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   This slow-growing disease ''often responds to treatment at the
very beginning, but then patients inevitably relapse and eventually
succumb,'' said Dr. Mark Kaminski of the University of Michigan.
''All sorts of things have been tried, but to date, there has been
no convincing evidence to show that any of those strategies
resulted in a cure.''
</P>
<P>
   The first glimpse of a possible breakthrough came in the early
1990s, when doctors began testing radioactive antibodies against
patients who had already failed standard chemotherapy drugs. About
70 percent of these patients responded to the treatment, and in
about 30 percent all visible signs of the cancer went away, at
least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest study, doctors tried the same approach as
front-line therapy -- offering it as the only medicine -- and it
showed impressive power.
</P>
<P>
   While researchers hope the improvement will be long-lasting and
possibly permanent, they caution that because of the slow-moving
nature of the disease, more follow-up will be needed to know
whether patients are truly cured. Typically, patients survive an
average of seven years when taking standard chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   The new treatment, called Bexxar, is being developed by Coulter
Pharmaceutical Inc. and SmithKline Beecham, which financed the
studies. It is still considered experimental and is not available
for routine use.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, all but two of 76 patients getting Bexxar as
upfront treatment responded with substantial shrinkage of their
tumors, and in three-quarters all outward signs of the disease
vanished.
</P>
<P>
   The patients have been followed for an average of two years so
far, and the doctors project that 70 percent of those whose disease
went away will still be disease-free after three years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will take a long time for us to know whether a cure has
been accomplished,'' Kaminski said. But ''there are some clues in
that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The disease involves a specific genetic mutation that can often
be detected through bone marrow tests. These tests are able to spot
one cancerous cell among 1 million normal ones. Patients almost
never lose all such traces of the disease after standard
chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Before the antibody treatment started, doctors could see cells
with these genetic mutations in 37 of the patients. After
treatment, they disappeared in 31 of them.
</P>
<P>
   The antibodies are welded to radioactive iodine-131. They target
a protein called cd20, which is on the surface of virtually all
lymphoma cells. The treatment is thought to work both by delivering
lethal radioactivity to the cancer cells and by flagging them for
destruction by the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike standard chemotherapy, which involves weeks of treatment,
Bexxar is given in two stages -- first a trace dose followed a week
or two later by one full dose. The only side effect is flu-like
symptoms for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Various kinds of antibodies are being tested against many
different forms of cancer. Kaminski said his study is the first
time that radioactive antibodies have been used alone as front-line
therapy for any kind of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Molecularly targeted therapy is very promising,'' said Dr.
Lori Goldstein of Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. ''It's
where most of our efforts will be in clinical trials in the
future.''

<HEADLINE> Anti-Depressants May Help Menopause  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- There is growing evidence that low doses of
anti-depression pills are effective at helping women going through
menopause avoid hot flashes, even if they are not depressed.
</P>
<P>
   A study released Monday is the largest yet to show that Prozac
and similar medicines can relieve -- though usually not eliminate --
this misery of menopause.
</P>
<P>
   The research suggests these drugs are probably not as effective
as estrogen, which is the standard treatment for symptoms of
menopause. But they could offer a safer alternative for women who
avoid hormone supplements because of fear of increasing their risk
of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest study, a modest dose of the anti-depressant
Effexor reduced hot flashes by about 60 percent. The drug was not
compared to estrogen, but in other studies the hormone has proven
to be about 80 percent effective.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Loprinzi and colleagues from the Mayo Clinic
conducted the study on 229 women, most of them breast cancer
survivors. Hot flashes tend be an especially bad problem after
breast cancer, since cancer medicines can cause hot flashes, and
these women are usually advised not to take estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, Loprinzi tested three doses of Effexor and found
that one-half the standard dose used to treat depression was most
effective. Just why it works, though, is a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't think it has anything to do with treating
depression,'' he said. ''None of the women in this trial were
clinically depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Loprinzi reported the findings at the annual scientific meeting
of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. It was financed by
the National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, smaller studies have suggested that similar
antidepressants, including Prozac, Paxil and Zoloft, also ease hot
flashes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We now have an approach with no bothersome toxic side effects
that can be used as an alternative'' to estrogen, said Dr. Lawrence
H. Einhorn of Indiana University. He said antidepressants may also
help relieve hot flashes in men who undergo chemical or surgical
castration, a common treatment for prostate cancer.

<HEADLINE> Annan: Lebanon Chaos Threatens Plan  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned Monday
that chaos breaking out in southern Lebanon threatened his plan to
increase the U.N. peacekeeping force there and called for maximum
restraint to ensure an orderly withdrawal of Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is close to culminating a 22-year effort to
fulfill its goal of Israeli withdrawal, an important step toward
Middle East peace, he told reporters after a Security Council
briefing. However, he said, it needs the cooperation of all
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Under 1978 Security Council resolutions, the U.N. force is
charged with verifying Israel's withdrawal and helping to restore
Lebanese authority to southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Annan issued his recommendations for a beefed-up U.N. force on a
day that frightened Israeli-allied militiamen fled to Israel's
border after their outposts in southern Lebanon fell to Shiite
Muslim guerrillas. The chaos left six civilians dead and prompted
calls for Israel to complete its withdrawal ahead of the July 7
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the seriousness of events in southern Lebanon, the
Security Council held an unscheduled meeting Monday afternoon.
After a second meeting that finished early Tuesday, the council
reached tentative agreement on a statement endorsing Annan's
recommendations and calling for all sides to restore calm to
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was expected to be adopted later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said that if the Israeli withdrawal date is moved up, it
would give the United Nations very little time to organize the
extra troops he said the U.N. force needs in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Annan warned that if the parties in the region failed to
cooperate and there were no ''viable alternatives,'' he might have
to recommended that the Security Council withdraw the U.N. troops
now stationed in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''You want us to be a punching bag in the middle, everybody
taking potshots at us, and everyone would then blame the U.N. for
everything that we are not responsible for?'' he retorted when
asked about the possibility on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, the secretary-general warned that unless the U.N.
force is beefed up from 4,500 troops to nearly 8,000, it would not
be able to do its job. It is now authorized to have about 7,000
forces.

<HEADLINE> White House, Hastert OK Renew Deal  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Six months after pledging to work together to
help impoverished areas, President Clinton and House Speaker Dennis
Hastert are ready to unveil their handiwork, a multibillion-dollar
package of tax breaks and other incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ''Working together, the Congress and the president can
accomplish good things for the American people,'' Hastert, R-Ill.,
said in a statement Monday night as an agreement was reached.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton's top economics adviser, Gene
Sperling, said, ''This will be one of the most important pieces of
legislation for bringing investment and capital into low-income
areas that has been passed in decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said aides were still calculating the total cost of the
proposed legislation to be trumpeted at today's White House
ceremony. He put the initial estimate at $5 billion to $7 billion
over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is a blend of Clinton's proposed ''new markets''
initiative and Hastert's call for 40 renewal communities.
</P>
<P>
   Certain capital gains taxes would be eliminated in these areas,
to be called ''Renewal Communities,'' and businesses would be
eligible for a credit on some wages as well certain expenses
related to environmental cleanup, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said an existing program of empowerment zones, also
designed to help economically distressed areas, would be expanded
in size and in scope.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also calls for a ''new markets tax credit'' for
taxpayers who invest in low income areas, whether the empowerment
zones or the new renewal communities, a provision the White House
had sought as energetically as Republicans pressed for the zero
capital gains tax.
</P>
<P>
   Another area of agreement would make churches and other
so-called faith-based institutions eligible to receive federal
grants to run substance abuse programs. Aides said this provision
would apply throughout the nation, regardless of whether the
program was operated inside a distressed area.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has toured the country to dramatize the plight of
communities left behind in the current economic expansion. For his
part, Hastert visited the Chicago district of Rep. Danny Davis,
D-Ill., to underscore his own interest in attacking poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The president and the speaker appeared together in Chicago in
November -- during a partisan budget battle -- and pledged to work
together on an effort to alleviate economic distress.
</P>
<P>
   They have negotiated in the months since, through aides as well
as in person. According to aides to both men, Hastert handed the
president his most recent in a series of back-and-forth offers last
week, when the two men were together for the signing of trade
legislation relating to Africa and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement comes only a few days before the House is
scheduled to vote on legislation granting permanent normal trade
relations with China. Aides refused to speculate Monday night on
the impact of the agreement -- likely to benefit the districts of
many members of the Congressional Black Caucus -- on the China vote.
</P>
<P>
   Several black caucus members are on a list of Democrats who
remain uncommitted on the China measure, which is expected to
produce a close vote in the House.
</P>
<P>
   According to material distributed by Hastert's office,
individuals would pay no capital gains on the sale of renewal
community business or business assets held for more than five
years. Small businesses would be able to take immediate deductions
for certain equipment. Businesses would receive a tax break for a
portion of the wages they pay, as well as for certain environmental
cleanup expenses. A tax deduction also would be available for
rehabilitating buildings inside the renewal community.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said the agreement calls for $200 million in increased
funding in the upcoming fiscal year for empowerment zones. The
proposal also would create nine new zones, and apply new tax
breaks, including the wage credit, to businesses that locate in any
of the existing or new zones.
</P>
<P>
   Other provisions are designed to facilitate low-income home
ownership and provide incentives for venture capital.

<HEADLINE> 4 Hostages Freed in Fiji Crisis  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Armed men holding Fiji's government hostage in
parliament released four of their captives Tuesday, as tribal
chiefs from the island nation met to try to negotiate an end to the
crisis, local news reports said.
</P>
<P>
   The freed hostages included legislator Michael Columbus, who was
suffering from diabetes, lawmaker Naresh Kumar, and two doctors who
had entered the parliament complex Saturday to treat Prime Minister
Mahendra Chaudhry for exhaustion, according to reports on a local
radio station and a news Web site, Fijilive.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said Columbus was helped into a car and driven away
when the four captives was freed late Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The release came as tribal chiefs from across Fiji met to try to
resolve the five-day crisis that began when armed indigenous
Fijians stormed parliament and took the Pacific nation's ethnic
Indian-led elected government hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Police and soldiers cordoned off the meeting Tuesday of the
Great Council of Chiefs -- the supreme body of indigenous Fijian
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry, Fiji's first prime minister of Indian descent, is
among the hostages in this South Pacific country where ethnic
tensions have been building in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara said Monday that the current
government might be replaced even if the coup attempt fails --
comments that appeared to be a conciliatory sign to the rebels.
Mara said he would hold talks with the democratically elected
government once the coup attempt ends.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will have a dialogue and see what they offer,'' he said.
''I cannot say I will put back the government that has caused all
these problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Sitiveni Rabuka, the president of the council, said he
supported Mara.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry's position ''now is untenable,'' Rabuka said. ''If he
feels for the country and he sees the demonstrations and the
destruction, he might feel that he wants to step down.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabuka, who led two coups and ruled for 12 years, said he
supports the aims of the armed rebels holding more than 20 Cabinet
ministers and lawmakers hostage, ''but not their methods.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebel leader George Speight on Monday renewed a threat to harm
the hostages if an armed rescue mission was mounted, reversing a
safety guarantee he gave Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If anyone enters the barriers of this complex with the view to
free them (the hostages) we will not hesitate,'' he said. ''Their
safety is conditional upon everybody staying out of this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Speight confirmed earlier reports that rebels had taken Chaudhry
outside into the grounds of parliament at gunpoint. He said it was
in response to an alleged attempt by an unknown group to enter the
compound.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said no rescue mission had been launched.
</P>
<P>
   Speight claims Chaudhry's year-old coalition discriminated
against indigenous Fijians. Tensions have been rising between the
indigenous people and the descendants of Indian migrants, who
dominate commerce in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Mara sent a letter to Speight on Sunday night promising to
address concerns of ethnic Fijians and pledging that ''the position
of the indigenous community will be protected and enhanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Fijians of Indian descent make up about 44 percent of Fiji's
population of 813,000, while indigenous Fijians account for 51
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he had a plan to end the standoff, which
would be presented Tuesday to the Great Council of Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our main objective is to see that no blood is spilled,'' Mara
said.
</P>
<P>
   Speight said he would ''retire'' if the council doesn't back his
coup attempt. Local media also reported he said he would release
his hostages if the council orders it.
</P>
<P>
   The failed businessman declared himself prime minister after
storming parliament with seven gunmen and swearing in a replacement
government.
</P>
<P>
   Police on Monday tightened security around Suva's parliament
complex, stopping news crews at checkpoints and searching vans
delivering food and other supplies.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Stanley Roth urged Fiji to
reinstall its democratically elected government and said if the
chiefs did not, the U.S. relationship with Fiji would deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   ''This meeting could play a major positive role in leading
toward a resolution of this crisis and the preservation of the
constitutionally elected government,'' Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the government were to be toppled by force, U.S. law would
require policy changes and again put the relationship on a downward
path and I think, the biggest losers would be the people of Fiji.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, New Zealand Foreign Minister Phil Goff announced
the United Nations was sending the head of the U.N. administration
in East Timor, Sergio Vieira de Mello, to Fiji to mediate in the
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Rockefeller Center on block for reported $2.5 billion  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD PYLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Four years after buying Rockefeller Center for
$1.2 billion, its ownership is putting the 12-building art deco
complex in midtown Manhattan up for sale -- at double the price.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller Center Properties Inc. Trust ended a week of
unconfirmed press reports by announcing on Monday it would seek
bids for the complex, reportedly with a $2.5 billion price tag.
</P>
<P>
   The news of the sale comes as ownership rides the crest of a
glitzy four-year refurbishment and a real estate boom after the
property sank into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   RCPI Trust noted that the center has undergone a massive
transformation since then that includes restoration of the famed
Radio City Music Hall theater, the addition of many new shops and
restaurants and other sweeping changes. Office vacancies are now
below 1 percent, a startling drop from 26 percent four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Accordingly, the principals of RCPI Trust have decided to
explore a sale or possible recapitalization of the property to
realize the considerable appreciation in value,'' spokesman Howard
Rubenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   He said decisions on whether to refinance or sell Rock Center
would be made by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the largest shareholder
in RCPI Trust, which bought the complex in 1996 from Japan's
Mitsubishi Estate Co. The Japanese company purchased it in 1989,
but the property deteriorated and its holding company slipped into
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Other investors and shareholders include banker David
Rockefeller, of the namesake family that built the complex; the
Crown family, of Chicago; the Agnelli family, of Italy; the
Niarchos family, of Greece, and the New York real estate giant
Tishman-Speyer Properties, which also manages the center.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller Center's landmarked 12-acre limestone complex is
anchored by the 70-story, slab-shaped GE Building. Formerly known
as the RCA Building, it has been home to NBC since it was built and
is topped by the swanky Rainbow Room, an icon among New York
restaurants that recently reopened under new management.
</P>
<P>
   The building overlooks the skating rink and plaza where the
Rockefeller Center Christmas tree draws hundreds of thousands of

<HEADLINE> 'Capture the Moment' -- a feast of Pulitzer Prize-winning photos  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- They're history, but these photographs still
give you goose bumps.
</P>
<P>
   There's the shot of an emaciated Sudanese girl, in near-fetal
position on a parched field. Just feet away sits a beady-eyed
vulture, eager for carrion.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the Norman Rockwell-style photo of President
Clinton, peering over a soda fountain into the happy-go-lucky face
of a boy in a baseball cap.
</P>
<P>
   They're part of the biggest ever exhibit of Pulitzer
Prize-winning photographs, ''Capture the Moment,'' which opened
Monday at the Newseum on Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Such shots are no fluke, insists J. Ross Baughman, who won the
prize in 1978 for his image of the Rhodesian civil war -- a soldier
of the white-led government holding a pistol flush to the head of a
black man prostrate in a lineup. The photographer was forced to
leave the country, smuggling out the film.
</P>
<P>
   ''They say you have to be at the right spot at the right time,''
says Baughman, now photo editor for The Washington Times. ''But
before you pick up a camera, for weeks, for months, you're going to
see what you have to tell the world. In this case, people caught in
the 'verb' of racism.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then you hold up your hand and say, 'This is significant.'''
</P>
<P>
   The more than 100 images on display record split seconds that
will forever touch viewers' souls.
</P>
<P>
   It's not an easy job.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Carter, the South African photographer who captured the
starving child, committed suicide two months after accepting the
Pulitzer in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He had taken the photo after hearing a high-pitched whimpering --
the voice of the tiny girl. He clicked his Nikon shutter, he said,
then sat under a tree, lit a cigarette, talked to God and cried.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really, really sorry I didn't pick up the child,'' he said
after his photo was published in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The collection begins with the Pulitzer for 1942, the first year
a photograph was eligible for the most prestigious award in
journalism, and extends to last year's images of Kosovo refugees
and the shooting at Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   War and conflict are dominant themes in the exhibit, from World
War II, Korea and Vietnam to America on the verge of nuclear war
with the Soviet Union over Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most indelible moments is Associated Press
photographer Paul Vathis' ''Two Men With a Problem,'' showing only
the backs of President Kennedy and former President Eisenhower as
they walk up a path at Camp David, conferring on the Bay of Pigs.
</P>
<P>
   Vathis remembers: ''I heard Ike say, 'I know a place where we
can talk.'''
</P>
<P>
   By then, photographers had been told to stop shooting. But
Vathis, crouching next to his Hasselblad on the ground, looked up
and saw the perfect picture -- ''the two men, looking so lonely
among the trees.''
</P>
<P>
   He knew the Secret Service agent blocking the view, a man
nicknamed Moose. Vathis begged him, ''Moose, open up your legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Click, click. His lens opened only twice.
</P>
<P>
   One shot of two powerful backs won the 1962 Pulitzer.
</P>
<P>
   But it was an excruciatingly expressive face that captured the
1990 feature photography Pulitzer, amid the anti-communist
revolution in Romania that toppled the blood-bathed dictatorship of
Nicolae Ceausescu.
</P>
<P>
   Prize-winner David Turnley, working for the Detroit Free Press,
was there with his twin brother, Peter Turnley, who worked for
Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   They both photographed the same man in a crowd cheering the
arrival of a busload of Western doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ''You see in his face more than euphoria,'' David Turnley said
of his subject. ''It's also catharsis -- and venom toward
Ceausescu.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, that man kept returning to the hotel where the
brothers had stayed. And finally, in 1992, Peter Turnley visited
again, his brother says, ''and the receptionist told him, 'You HAVE
to meet this man. He wants to tell you how he felt in that
moment.'''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit remains in New York through Sept. 23, then travels
to the Arlington, Va., headquarters of the Newseum, an interactive
gallery that shows visitors how news is made. It is sponsored by
the Freedom Forum, a nonpartisan foundation that promotes a free
press and free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Starting today, an AP-sponsored show of photographs called
''Eyes on Africa'' opens in Brooklyn. Its more than 350 images
celebrate photojournalists and videojournalists who worked, often
anonymously and in danger, to capture Africa in war and peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eyes on Africa'' runs through July 15 at the Five Myles
gallery, named after Myles Tierney, an AP television producer
killed by rebel gunmen in Sierra Leone last year.

4 Hostages Freed in Fiji Crisis
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Armed men holding Fiji's government hostage in parliament
released four of their captives Tuesday, as tribal chiefs from the island nation
met to try to negotiate an end to the crisis, local news reports said. The freed
hostages included legislator Michael Columbus, who was suffering from diabetes,
lawmaker Naresh Kumar, and two doctors who had entered the parliament complex
Saturday to treat Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry for exhaustion, according to
reports on a local radio station and a news Web site, Fijilive.

Israeli Troops Leave S.Lebanon Base
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   METULLA, Israel (AP) -- Israeli troops pulled out of their second-largest
base in southern Lebanon overnight, quickening the pace of their withdrawal.
Convoys of Israeli soldiers drove out of Lebanon at daybreak in tanks and jeeps
Tuesday, honking horns, waving brigade banners and kissing the soil of their
homeland. The army described the predawn departure from the Bint Jabail -- one
of its Lebanon headquarters, in the western sector of Israel's rapidly emptying
''security zone'' -- as orderly. Some young soldiers called their mothers to let
them know they were back in Israeli territory.

   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- In an attempt to bring armed rebels occupying Parliament
closer to surrender, Fiji's president said Monday that the current government
might be replaced even if the coup attempt fails. President Ratu Sir Kamisese
Mara's comments appeared to be a conciliatory sign to indigenous Fijian rebels,
who have been holding government officials hostage since storming Parliament on
Friday. In a meeting that Mara said he expected would help end the crisis,
indigenous tribal chiefs from across Fiji met Tuesday outside the capital of
Suva.

   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Incessant weekend rains triggered flooding and

the Lakers' most lopsided loss of the season. Wallace made three 3-pointers in a
20-0 third-quarter outburst as Portland evened the best-of-seven Western
Conference finals 1-1. The Lakers lost at home for the first time in eight
playoff games and the second time in 26 games since losing to the Blazers on
Jan. 22. Los Angeles is 43-6 at home.

<HEADLINE> Donna Brazile: Born for Politics  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN MILLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Donna Brazile entered politics at 9 --
already savvy enough to figure the angles.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted a playground for her Kenner, La., neighborhood, so
she enlisted the help of friends to campaign door to door for a
city council candidate who had promised to build one. But they
focused on another promise he'd made that had broader appeal -- to
pave roads.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected; she got her playground.
</P>
<P>
   Now 40, Brazile is in a much bigger league. As manager of Vice
President Al Gore's presidential campaign, she works 15-hour days
to keep Democratic activists, volunteers and staff members
organized, motivated and within budget.
</P>
<P>
   The self-proclaimed diva, who can curse like a sailor before
quoting the 27th Psalm, is just as likely to greet you at her
office pushing a vacuum or holding a pot of homemade gumbo as with
a phone to her ear.
</P>
<P>
   She carries in her pockets small, smooth stones etched with the
words ''passion'' and ''love.'' In her purse, she has ''vision.''
</P>
<P>
   But she doesn't say much publicly, burned in the past by her own
politically hot comments.
</P>
<P>
   Take her statement that the Republicans ''bring out Colin Powell
and J.C. Watts because they have no program, no policy. ... They'd
rather take pictures with black children than feed them.''
</P>
<P>
   A black woman, and the first to manage a major presidential
campaign, she also upset some moderate Democrats by claiming ''the
four pillars of the Democratic Party are African-Americans, labor,
women, and what I call other ethnic minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Lying low now, she said, ''I don't want to be part of the
chatter around the campaign. I want to be part of its success. I
want to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Carrick, a Democratic media consultant who worked with
Brazile on Rep. Dick Gephardt's 1988 presidential campaign, said,
''It's a shame, sometimes the most colorful and honest people get
punished for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazile was fired from the 1988 Michael Dukakis presidential
campaign after saying his Republican opponent, then-Vice President
George Bush, should ''fess up'' to having an affair.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking absolution, Brazile, a Catholic, also paid penance by
working nine months in a homeless shelter. She says she believes
God has forgiven her.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's son, George W. Bush, the presumptive GOP nominee, has
branded her a Democratic ''attack dog.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, Brazile has served as a front-and-center symbol for a
candidate trying to excite black voters the way President Clinton
does. Several times during the primaries, when speaking to black
audiences, Gore has pulled Brazile onstage to take a bow.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her mother was a maid, her father was a janitor. She worked
hard for her education. She helped to change the community, and now
she's helping to change this country,'' Gore has said.
</P>
<P>
   Born Dec. 15, 1959, she was the third of nine children born to
Jean and Lionel Brazile, a couple who lived quietly in the poor
town of Kenner, just west of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents weren't involved the civil rights movement, but
Brazile said she read black power manifestos on the sly. Neighbors
who were school teachers, ministers and blue-collar workers sparked
her interest, which was heightened by her own experience with
cross-town busing to a white school.
</P>
<P>
   Kenner television reporter Sabrina Wilson, who rode that bus to
Grace King High School, said Brazile never went in for ''girly-girl
chat.''
</P>
<P>
   ''She was very, very focused, handing out leaflets for
politicians and trying to get kids involved in whatever campaign
she had going.''
</P>
<P>
   She's always been an organizer, says Kenner Councilman Marc
Johnson, who as a child helped Brazile in her playground campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would cut grass every summer and she'd be the one to go out
and get the jobs, supervise us, get the money and pay us. But she
wasn't just overseeing things. She'd roll up her sleeves and do
whatever she had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 16, Brazile was the Jefferson Parish youth coordinator
for Jimmy Carter's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, while studying psychology at Louisiana State
University, she became a student organizer for Carter.
</P>
<P>
   And when Brazile was 22 and fresh out of college, Coretta Scott
King asked her to organize the 20th anniversary of her late
husband's 1963 march on Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought Coretta had lost her mind. Why would you recommend
somebody just out of college to do that?'' Eleanor Holmes Norton,
Washington, D.C.'s delegate to Congress, said of Brazile, her
former chief of staff. ''It had to do with raw talent.''
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Brazile joined the Rev. Jesse Jackson's
presidential campaign as his Southern field director. In the 1988
Democratic primaries, she was Gephardt's field director and moved
on to Dukakis during the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Brazile also has worked for Jackson's Rainbow Coalition and the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, helped found the
National Political Congress of Black Women and taught a course on
blacks in politics at the University of Maryland. She worked in
both Clinton-Gore campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore's previous campaign manager, Craig Smith, declined to
move to Nashville in the midst of the campaign shake-up last fall,
the vice president promoted Brazile, then his political director
and deputy campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   She refused any pay increase, cut her salary from $120,000 to
$95,000 and set that as a campaign-wide ceiling, forcing others at
the top to take pay cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Some said the promotion was window dressing -- to diversify an
inner circle of white males -- but Carrick said ''if you wanted
somebody to go in there and be a front person and you picked Donna,
you'd be making a big mistake.''

<HEADLINE> Guerrillas Take Over S.Lebanon Town  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA ABU-NASR
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANSOURI, Lebanon (AP) -- Lebanese guerrillas and their jubilant
civilian sympathizers swept into a major town Tuesday in the
disintegrating Israeli occupation zone in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army, expected to complete its withdrawal from
Lebanon over the next few days, said its troops abandoned its
western sector headquarters in Bint Jbeil overnight. Bint Jbeil,
the second largest town in the occupation zone, was the last major
Shiite Muslim town the Israelis and its Lebanese militia allies
have held since establishing the zone in 1985 to protect northern
Israel from guerrilla attack.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Israeli withdrawal from Bint Jbeil, crowds
surged into the town. Many waved the flags of the main Shiite
Muslim guerrilla groups Hezbollah and Amal and shouted
pro-Hezbollah slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Such scenes have been repeated over and over since Sunday.
Members of the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army were fleeing to
Israel in fear of reprisals they might face in Lebanon or
surrendering to the Lebanese army to take their chances with
Lebanese laws that punish collaboration with Israel with jail terms
and even death.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen villages in the occupied zone have been captured by
guerrillas and sympathizers since Sunday without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Israel announced earlier this year it would pull out of Lebanon
by July 7 after seeing its troops slowly picked off by guerrillas
for years. The July deadline has apparently been pushed up in light
of the events on the ground. Overnight, Israel's army radio cited
high-ranking army officials as saying the withdrawal would be over
within a few days.
</P>
<P>
   As the Israeli army evacuated Bint Jebeil, convoys of trucks
brought weapons, equipment and scores of soldiers across the border
from the base. Soldiers in tanks and jeeps honked horns, waved
brigade banners and kissed the soil of their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've made it,'' one soldier shouted. Another soldier kissed
the ground. One officer carried a Torah scroll.
</P>
<P>
   The army described the predawn departure as orderly.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation came after Israel's security Cabinet held a
late-night emergency session, and told Prime Minister Ehud Barak he
had full authority to determine the pace of the pullout, but army
radio cited high-ranking army officials as saying the withdrawal
would be over within a few days.
</P>
<P>
   With Shiite SLA militiamen surrendering or fleeing ahead of the
Shiite guerrilla and popular sweep to reclaim villages, the
2,500-member SLA pulled back on Monday to Christian villages.
</P>
<P>
   SLA fighters retained headquarters in the Christian town of
Marjayoun in the eastern sector, but were unable to travel to
pockets in western parts except through Israel. Only a few posts
adjacent to the border in the west remain in Israeli hands.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people also moved from Mansouri, a coastal village
just south of the southern port city of Tyre on the former edge of
the occupied zone, into their villages after long years of
displacement. The southerners were allowed to cross a Lebanese army
checkpoint into the south after it was clear SLA resistance all but
collapsed as militiamen surrendered or retreated to other areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't remember my village, but I can imagine what it's
like,'' said 22-year-old Linda Haidar, who was only 4 when her
family left Teir Harfa in the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my mind, it's a simple village with generous people and
thanks to the Islamic Resistance we are returning home,'' said the
Shiite woman, dressed in a long dark robe, head covered with a
scarf.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 SLA militiamen surrendered overnight to the
Lebanese army, Lebanese security officials said, bringing the total
of militiamen giving up since Sunday to 300. More than two dozen
SLA militiamen were hauled into an army truck at Mansouri, about 15
miles north of the Israeli border and the same distance northwest
of Bint Jbeil.
</P>
<P>
   Six civilians were killed and 19 injured in violence that
erupted Monday as Israel's withdrawal deadline neared. Israeli and
allied militia gunners opened up on Lebanese guerrillas and
supporters who surged toward the border to reclaim their villages
while some of the Lebanese militiamen retreated in disarray or
surrendered en masse.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's air force on Monday targeted guerrillas and military
equipment and positions abandoned by their allies to prevent its
seizure while guerrillas blew up former enemy fortifications. It
also repelled attacks by guerrillas on remaining positions, using
helicopter gunships and the firepower of naval gunboats.
</P>
<P>
   In northern Israel, the army beefed up border defenses and tens
of thousands of civilians hastily gathered up children, food and
schoolbooks as the army ordered them into underground bomb shelters
since Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of what was a front line for 15 years puts the
guerrillas on Israel's doorstep, divides the Israeli-occupied zone,
and hands control of a quarter of the area to the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid developments drew a warning from Israel that it could
send its troops again into Lebanon to keep the guerrillas out.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Town the 'Sex-Change Capital'  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE ARRILLAGA
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRINIDAD, Colo. (AP) -- The young waitress examined her customers
as she refilled their coffee and haltingly asked whether anyone
wanted more tea.
</P>
<P>
   There was Elise, a buxom brunette in a crop top and hip-huggers.
Kate, a Harvard graduate writer in khakis, hand-knit sweater and
pearl earrings. Thea, a graphics designer sporting chic suede
boots. And Jackie, a towering figure in trousers and blazer.
</P>
<P>
   In the lunchtime crowd of merchants, housewives and farmers at
the Main Street Bakery and Cafe, the four stuck out like fashion
models on a pig farm. Retreating to the kitchen, the waitress
pulled her boss aside and stammered, ''Those women I'm waiting on?
They're men!''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anyone else gave the foursome a second glance. Not in
Trinidad. Not in the so-called ''Sex Change Capital of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeat that phrase to almost any of the town's 9,500 souls and
you're likely to be get a lecture on what the southern Colorado
hamlet should be known for -- its idyllic scenery, comfortable
climate and friendly people.
</P>
<P>
   But most don't mind that more sex-change operations have been
done in their town than anywhere else (about 4,500 to date); they
just hate that nickname.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody cares,'' says Monica Violante, owner of the Main Street
Bakery. ''It's just a part of Trinidad.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no formal statistics are kept on the number of sex
reassignment surgeries, experts in the field agree that Trinidad's
Stanley Biber -- because of the year he began and his age -- has
performed more than anyone. The International Foundation for Gender
Education lists only 14 surgeons in the United States and Canada
that do the procedure and, as spokeswoman Sara Herwig points out,
''Biber's been doing it longer than most.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes Trinidad unique is not that it's the sex-change
capital of the world, but the fact that this former mining town has
come to accept its destiny, depend on it and even embrace it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, Trinidad was a town in transition. Coal had been king
in these parts since the turn of the century, but after World War
II the mines began closing, and by the late '60s only a few
remained. Families left and Main Street, once a bustling collection
of department stores, car dealerships and restaurants, became a
lifeless shell of shuttered storefronts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Biber was thriving from his fourth-floor office inside the
First National Bank building. As Trinidad's only general surgeon,
Biber did it all -- from delivering babies and removing appendixes
to reconstructing the cleft palates of poor children.
</P>
<P>
   An Iowa native who once wanted to be a rabbi, Biber moved here
in 1954 after serving as a MASH surgeon in Korea and finishing a
stint at Camp Carson in Colorado Springs. A friend had told him
about a mining town near New Mexico that needed a surgeon, and when
he arrived to find mountains where he could hunt and lakes where he
could fish, he never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   In those first 15 years, Biber built a comfortable life around a
practice he loved and a town he adored. In 1969, he encountered the
patient who would forever change both.
</P>
<P>
   A social worker Biber had met through his welfare cases asked
him to perform her surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well of course,'' he told her. ''What do you want done?''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a transsexual,'' she replied. And Biber said simply,
''What is that?''
</P>
<P>
   After consulting a New York physician who had done sex
reassignment operations and obtaining hand-drawn sketches from
Johns Hopkins University, Biber agreed to do the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was very happy,'' he recalls. ''And then it started
spreading all over.''
</P>
<P>
   With less than a handful of doctors performing the procedure,
Trinidad became THE place to come for a sex-change operation, and
Biber was THE man to do it.
</P>
<P>
   The town's sole hospital, Mt. San Rafael, was run by Catholic
nuns and Biber hid the charts of his first transsexual patients.
But he knew he'd eventually need the approval of the hospital board
and his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Biber explained his work to the sisters and local ministers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went through the psychology of it all. They decided as long
as we were doing a service, and it was a good service, that there
was no reason we couldn't continue doing them,'' he says, adding
that while some were opposed, others began counseling his patients.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Biber was lecturing to the hospital staff and the public.
</P>
<P>
   ''We figured that's his way of making a living; more power to
him,'' says Linda Martinez, 54, a lifelong patient of Biber's.
</P>
<P>
   Not all agree. The Rev. Verlyn Hanson, pastor of the First
Baptist Church for the past three years, says the town turned a
blind eye to Biber's work because of the economic boost it
provided.
</P>
<P>
   ''The love of money is the root of all evil, and people will
overlook a lot of evil to have a stronger economy,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Biber's operations brought about $1 million a year
to the hospital, according to his estimates. The basic procedure
costs about $11,000, with the hospital taking in a little more than
half.
</P>
<P>
   ''It certainly has been a substantive piece to the financial
jigsaw puzzle,'' says hospital chief executive Paul Herman.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of his practice, Biber performed about 150
transsexual operations a year. His patients brought families and
friends who remained in town during their loved ones' eight-day
hospital stay.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not people liked what Biber did, they liked the
squat, balding doctor who wore jeans and flannel shirts to work and
always said hello.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's such a good doctor in all the other ways we accept it and
shrug it off,'' says Virgil Micek, who for 30 years has run a music
store a few doors down from Biber's office.
</P>
<P>
   At 77, Biber has scaled back his transsexual business to about
100 surgeries a year. The majority of his practice remains tending
to the ills of Trinidad's citizens. But he knows retirement may not
be far off, and he's in search of a surgeon who will come to
Trinidad and continue his work.
</P>
<P>
   ''It started here, and I want the hospital to continue with
it,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> NKorea Defectors Doubtful on Summit  </HEADLINE>
By KYONG-HWA SEOK
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Reunions of separated families are
likely to be a prominent topic at the upcoming summit between the
leaders of South Korea and North Korea. Chang In Sook, though,
isn't optimistic that it will lead to her seeing her son again.
</P>
<P>
   Chang, 59, is a North Korean defector living in the South -- a
class of citizen that the totalitarian government in Pyongyang
accuses of treason.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea might agree to more reunions of relatives who have
not seen each other since the 1950-53 Korean War or earlier. But it
is doubtful that it would grant such a favor to North Koreans who
dared flee their poor and repressive homeland in the years
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Chang has not seen one of her four sons for two years and does
not even know if he is alive. Her saga began in 1990, when another
son, who had been studying in Ukraine, defected to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Chang, an architect, and her children had lived
relatively comfortable lives as intellectuals in Pyongyang. Her
son's defection destroyed all that.
</P>
<P>
   Angry officials stripped Chang's other sons of jobs or expelled
them from schools, and they were moved to a barren border town. In
1998, they illegally crossed into China, but one son was left
behind, arrested after a tip-off by his in-laws about the escape
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never spend a day without thinking of him,'' Chang said.
''He is always in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Several million North Koreans fled to South Korea after the
peninsula divided in 1945 and during the Korean War. Most have no
contact with their relatives in the North, although some temporary
reunions have been held, mostly in China with the help of
intermediaries.
</P>
<P>
   The June 12-14 summit between South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung and his North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong Il, will be the
first-ever meeting between leaders of the South and North. But
prospects for the meeting are mixed among the nearly 1,000 North
Koreans who have defected to South Korea since the end of the war.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a show directed by Kim Jong Il. If you have lived in the
North, you would know,'' said Kim Ok Ran, 42, who defected to South
Korea in 1997 with her son and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, who works for a charity organization for North Korean
refugees in China and other nations, said the North is unlikely to
change its policies in any significant way.
</P>
<P>
   Chung Nam, Chang's youngest son, echoed that sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ''South Koreans are just too excited about the whole thing. They
just don't understand how things work in North Korea. Its policy
has not changed, only the tactics,'' said Chung, 26, who is
studying mass media at a Seoul university.
</P>
<P>
   He expects the North to take offers of economic aid from the
South while remaining largely closed to outside influence.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's economy went into a free fall after the collapse
of the former Soviet Union stripped it of key trade partners and
aid providers. Then its inefficient collective farm industry was
hit by bad weather beginning in 1995, leading to widespread famine.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the North's economy has hit bottom and has shown
small signs of improvement, but food shortages remain common.
</P>
<P>
   Not all North Korean defectors are negative about the summit,
however, though they may not gain anything.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although it might not immediately benefit us defectors, I, for
one, have great expectations for the summit,'' said Kim Soon Young,
23, who works for a wedding event company.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, who defected to South Korea with her parents and two
sisters in the summer of 1998, has aunts and uncles on her mother's
side in the North.

<HEADLINE> Bush To Outline World Plan  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush was continuing his focus on
defense and international relations with an appearance today with
retired Gen. Colin Powell and a speech outlining how, as president,
he would ensure ''certainty in an uncertain world.''
</P>
<P>
   Closing a two-day swing through the nation's capital, the
Republican presidential nominee-in-waiting also planned a private
visit with House Republicans for a meeting that was part pep rally
and partly an attempt to highlight their policy similarities.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor told an audience at a fund-raiser Monday
night that he would address ensuring ''certainty in an uncertain
world'' -- a phrase he has used in the past when speaking about
setting foreign policy priorities so that the U.S. military isn't
overly deployed.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said only that ''several distinguished guests'' would join
Bush at a National Press Club news conference. Powell, the Joint
Chiefs of Staff chairman during the Gulf War, is a possible
candidate for vice president or a Cabinet post, though he has said
he isn't interested in being Bush's running mate. Bush's father,
the former president, also was in town Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have said Bush lacks the foreign policy experience
needed in a president.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Bush accused the Clinton administration of
taking sides in last year's Israeli elections, which he said
continued a pattern of the United States trying ''to make Israel
conform to its own plans and timetables.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Vice President Al Gore, Bush's Democratic rival
for the presidency, said the remark was an ''irresponsible and
reckless allegation'' that raised questions about Bush's fitness to
be a world leader.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who cited no specifics to support his accusation, said
pressure from the administration on Israel ''is not the path to
peace.'' Instead, he said, the Jewish state should be supported as
it settles its own affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In the Israeli election, the administration was seen as favoring
the eventual winner, Ehud Barak, over then-Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu. Among other things, James Carville, President Clinton's
former political adviser, filled that same role for Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said Bush also was upset that
Clinton pressed for settlement deadlines during the 1998 Wye River
peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   With the talks faltering, Clinton held lengthy meetings with
both sides on Maryland's Eastern Shore. He also joined Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in setting deadlines this year for
a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''America should not interfere in Israel's democratic process,
and America will not interfere in Israeli elections when I am the
president,'' Bush told some 2,000 delegates attending the annual
policy conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''In recent times, Washington has tried to make Israel conform
to its own plans and timetables, but this is not the path to
peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also reiterated his support for moving the U.S. Embassy in
Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ''As soon as I take office, I will begin the process of moving
the U.S. ambassador to the city Israel has chosen as its capital,''
he said to a standing ovation, his only one of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane denied the administration chose
sides in the election. He added: ''It's irresponsible and reckless
for the governor to make such a charge involving a region of the
world where people ought to be careful what they're saying. It
really does raise a question of his readiness to be a leader in
international affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Bush has met with Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo and Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov. He is to meet
Thursday in Austin, Texas, with Thabo Mbeki, president of South
Africa. Mbeki met with Gore on Monday before attending a state
dinner at the White House with Clinton and the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had been scheduled to meet Tuesday with Barak, but the
prime minister canceled his trip to the United States after
violence flared on Israel's West Bank and in South Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Backs UN on Israeli pullout  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is backing the
United Nations in trying to arrange an orderly retreat of Israeli
troops from southern Lebanon and is urging other governments to
endorse Secretary-General Kofi Annan's proposals as well.
</P>
<P>
   But, senior U.S. officials said Monday, the United States is not
offering to send American troops into the explosive situation. The
support is strictly diplomatic, they stressed as Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright made a round of telephone calls to Annan and
leaders in Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Annan recommended increasing the current U.N. peacekeeping force
of some 4,500 to 5,600 and, in a second phase, to 7,900. Annan also
proposed Lebanon ''resume the normal responsibilities of a state
throughout the area.''
</P>
<P>
   As Israel's 22-year-old security zone inside southern Lebanon
buckled, with militant Shiite guerrillas rushing up to Israel's
border and pro-Israeli militia falling back, Prime Minister Ehud
Barak sought assurances of a peaceful pullout from both the Clinton
administration and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by satellite to a conference of an influential
pro-Israel lobby in the United States, Barak said he would hold
Syria and Lebanon accountable if the troop withdrawal was marked by
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Albright responded with telephone diplomacy and a statement that
said ''there can be no justification for initiating acts of
violence'' while Israel was carrying out a withdrawal called for by
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   She called on all parties ''to exercise maximum restraint and
refrain from any acts of violence.'' And Albright urged support for
Annan as he tried to minimize civilian casualties and help
stabilize the region.
</P>
<P>
   Barak addressed some 2,000 delegates to the American Israeli
Public Affairs Committee amid hurried telephone consultation with
Albright and senior Israeli military officers.
</P>
<P>
   Albright had already given public and unqualified support to
Israel in its plan to pull out, despite Syrian objections.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful that Barak wants to quit Lebanon to stop a steady stream
of Israeli casualties, Syria would like to arrange simultaneously
for an Israeli pullback on the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   But despite President Clinton's direct intervention with Syrian
President Hafez Assad, U.S.-backed negotiations between Israel and
Syria have stalemated and the strategic border enclave lost by
Syria in the 1967 Mideast war remains in Israel's hands.
</P>
<P>
   With the situation along the border with Lebanon growing more
tense by the day, Barak said Albright had assured him the United
States would play a role in the pullout -- one that he did not spell
out -- and that he wanted the U.N. Security Council to endorse the
withdrawal as well.
</P>
<P>
   Albright has not said whether the administration would provide
concrete help to Israel, but the senior U.S. officials who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the assistance was entirely
diplomatic.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are determined to pull out in the near future,'' Barak
said. ''I would not recommend to anyone to try us once we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the pullout has already begun in bits and pieces.
Barak may be getting into position to try to complete it before a
self-imposed July 7 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, his warning to Lebanon and Syria was unqualified.
''We hold the Lebanese and Syrian governments responsible to make
sure it will be quiet,'' the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said a quarter-million Israelis in northern villages were
compelled to take refuge in shelters from cross-border attacks.
''They may have to stay there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said confidently, ''We will prevail and we will pull out
of Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak had been scheduled to attend the conference and probably
to meet with Clinton at the White House, but the violence in
southern Lebanon and on the West Bank caused him to cancel the
trip.

<HEADLINE> Missouri Rep. Ends 5th-Term Bid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Conservative Missouri Democratic Rep. Pat
Danner, who disclosed in January that she was battling breast
cancer, has ended her re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Secretary of State's office said Danner filed
paperwork Monday to withdraw from her race for a fifth term. Danner
did not issue a statement and could not immediately be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, a fellow Missourian, said,
''She will be sorely missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Danner, 66, announced in January she had undergone surgery for
breast cancer but called her prognosis ''excellent'' and filed to
run for re-election. Since then, she has sponsored legislation to
expand Medicaid coverage for poor women with breast or cervical
cancer, saying that her own outlook was positive because her cancer
was discovered and treated early.
</P>
<P>
   Danner becomes the eighth Democratic lawmaker to retire this
year, compared with 24 Republicans, including Rep. Rick Lazio, who
plunged into the New York Senate race late last week.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP immediately claimed Missouri's 6th District as
politically marginal, although President Clinton won it both times
he ran. Danner defeated the Republican incumbent, Rep. Tom Coleman,
by 10 percentage points in 1992. She won in 1998 with nearly 71
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee,
Jim Wilkinson, called the seat competitive and ''a very strong
pickup opportunity for House Republicans.''

<HEADLINE> Clintons Host Dinner for Mbeki  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Awash in a sea of blooms beckoning a new
season, President Clinton and South African President Thabo Mbeki
celebrated the ties of their two governments in a state dinner that
brought together Washington's elite with Hollywood's most famous.
</P>
<P>
   It was a who's who list of guests to honor the South African
leader: singers Harry Belafonte, Stevie Wonder and Lenny Kravitz,
Republican Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah and William Frist of Tennessee
along with director Spike Lee and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Guests entered the South Lawn Pavilion to a ''blush of summer''
with at least 50 peonsies adorning each table. The menu included
several South African-inspired dishes.
</P>
<P>
   ''A great deal unites South Africa and the United States,''
Clinton said. ''This relationship between our two countries is a
very special thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki praised Clinton for a recent law expanding trade with
Africa and said, ''That friendship is getting closer and closer.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a departure from serious talks the two held earlier on
AIDS prevention and treatment in South Africa, where one in 10 are
affected by the disease. Mbeki has come under criticism for his
positions on AIDS treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday night there was little hint of that debate as
officials marked Mbeki's first visit to Washington since succeeding
Nelson Mandela as South Africa's president.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner also served as a respite for Hillary Rodham Clinton,
who broke off campaigning for the Senate from New York to attend.
Mrs. Clinton, wearing a black Pamela Dennis gown, appeared relaxed
and chatted with several guests.
</P>
<P>
   The White House chose a lavish affair to host the South African
delegation, inviting some 360 guests to sample fare that included
green and white asparagus, wild leek marinated lobster, herbed
spring vegetables and apricot ginger glazed lamb, complete with
African spices. For dessert, there was pineapple surprise
Queenstown, an ice cream sherbert treat named for the South African
town that boasts several pineapple farms.
</P>
<P>
   Guests were entertained by pianist Awadagin Pratt, who played
several selections previously recorded live in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The event was one of the largest dinners in the Clinton White
House, officials said. The receiving line lasted more than an hour.
Even the president clapped when it ended.
</P>
<P>
   The indoor setting defied the dreary tug-of-war between spring
and summer that left Washington with cool temperatures and an
incessant drizzle.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the pavilion were drapes upon drapes of peach chamoise
overhead. The tables burst with color of their own with
centerpieces of blush, pink and burgundy peonies surrounded by
assorted crystal votive candles.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoors, everything from the blossoming dogwood trees to the
outdoor fountain was adorned with white lights.
</P>
<P>
   So guests wouldn't face the risk of raindrops, trolleys were
brought in to ferry them.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Mbeki presented Clinton, an avid coin
collector, with a set of four 24-carat coins produced by the South
African Mint. The president gave Mbeki a specially designed Tiffany
sterling silver cache pot with an engraved inscription.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Troops Leave S.Lebanon Base  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE COPANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   METULLA, Israel (AP) -- Israeli troops pulled out of their
second-largest base in southern Lebanon overnight, quickening the
pace of their withdrawal. Convoys of Israeli soldiers drove out of
Lebanon at daybreak in tanks and jeeps Tuesday, honking horns,
waving brigade banners and kissing the soil of their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The army described the predawn departure from the Bint Jbeil --
one of its Lebanon headquarters, in the western sector of Israel's
rapidly emptying ''security zone'' -- as orderly. Some young
soldiers called their mothers to let them know they were back in
Israeli territory.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese guerrillas and their jubilant civilian sympathizers
then swept into the town. Many of those in the crowd waved the
flags of the main Shiite Muslim guerrilla groups Hezbollah and Amal
and shouted pro-Hezbollah slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several busloads of Lebanese -- apparently troops of
Israel's collapsing allied SLA militia and their families -- crossed
over into Israel early Tuesday at the Rosh HaNikra border post.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's security Cabinet, which met in late-night session, told
Prime Minister Ehud Barak he had full authority to determine the
pace of the pullout, but army radio cited high-ranking army
officials as saying the withdrawal would be over within a few days.
</P>
<P>
   The pullout initially was due to be completed by July 7.
</P>
<P>
   As Israeli's troop withdrawal proceeded at full speed, tens of
thousands of Israelis living near the border spent an uneasy night
in bomb shelters, with the boom of artillery duels clearly audible
just across the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   The rapidly deteriorating situation in south Lebanon -- including
concern that Israel's allied militia could be lurching toward
collapse -- had brought calls from some to expedite Israel's troop
pullout from the zone in south Lebanon where it has had a military
presence for the past 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   Haim Ramon, a Cabinet minister and confidant of Barak, said at
the meeting that he hoped the pullout would be ''much earlier''
than the deadline Israel imposed on itself in July.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon also told Israel's Channel 2 that once the troops are out
of Lebanon, Israel will feel far less constrained in terms of
reprisals if it is attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ''Up until now ... we could not react as we are capable of
doing, using the full power of the (army),'' he said. ''The rules
of the game are changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel beefed up defenses on its northern border -- army tank
transporters were seen Monday night on the road leading north -- and
warned that attacks on either its troops or its northern
communities would bring harsh reprisals, not limited to the battle
zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''If someone initiates attacks on Israeli soldiers, not to
mention the settlements of the north, as we withdraw ... the
response will be very painful,'' said Barak, speaking in the border
town of Zarit. ''I don't recommend to anyone in the area to provoke
a response from Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kiryat Shemona, the principal border town, loudspeakers
blared orders to head into shelters after word came that two
Lebanese civilians had been killed in the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
   In a crowded market, people grabbed their groceries and hurried
off. Even youngsters like 12-year-old Efrat Ohana knew enough to
take cover quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was on the way home from school, and as my mother taught me,
I ran with my bag to the shelter in the building and waited for my
parents to come home from work,'' she said calmly.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic heading south was heavy as some northerners opted to
flee out of rocket range rather than spend a night in shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Barak repeated Monday that Israel's troop pullout would be
completed by its self-imposed deadline of July 7, but said the
exact date will be decided ''according to ... Israel's
considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those considerations is the state of Israel's allied
militia, the South Lebanon Army, elements of which appear to be
sliding into a state of chaos. Over the past few days, SLA
militiamen have been abandoning outposts, deserting by the dozens
and seeking shelter in Israel, apparently fearing for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   With the pullback of the SLA, sympathizers of the Shiite Muslim
Hezbollah guerrillas have in the past two days taken over a dozen
villages, giving the guerrillas a foothold close by the Israeli
border.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, five SLA men -- all senior officers, according to
Israel radio -- crossed over into Israel near the communal farm of
Milkhia to plead for asylum for themselves and dozens of relatives.
Israel has promised to provide shelter to fleeing militiamen and
their families.
</P>
<P>
   SLA men remaining in Lebanon after the pullout face the threat
of reprisals from Hezbollah, which led the fight to drive out
Israel, and from the Lebanese government, which considers the SLA
troops traitors and has sentenced some officers to death in
absentia.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli daily Maariv, in Monday's editions, said senior
Israeli military officers had ''great doubt'' as to whether the SLA
could continue to function.
</P>
<P>
   So rife was speculation about a speeded-up withdrawal timetable
that the Defense Ministry issued a statement explicitly denying
there was any order to pull out on June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Worry is growing about SLA-abandoned weaponry falling into the
hands of Hezbollah. On Monday, Israeli warplanes destroyed an SLA
artillery battery in the central area of the occupied zone after it
was abandoned by its crew, the army said.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials said it had been known all along that a
unilateral pullout from south Lebanon -- without any guarantees from
Lebanon that it would prevent guerrilla attacks -- might not go
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Asked on Israel TV whether the situation had spun out of
control, Israel's justice minister, Yossi Beilin, said: ''Anyone
who spoke about withdrawal without an agreement understood it would
be a withdrawal without rice being thrown at soldiers, and would
not be simple.''

<HEADLINE> Blazers Aggressive From Opening Tip  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Scottie Pippen's urgency set the tone for the
Portland Trail Blazers. He crashed the boards, pounded the ball
inside and created fouls for the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen's play was contagious as the Trail Blazers rediscovered
their aggressiveness in beating the Lakers 106-77 Monday night to
tie the best-of-seven Western Conference finals 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Games 3 and 4 are in Portland beginning Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He pressured their team into playing aggressively,'' Lakers
coach Phil Jackson said of Pippen, who had 21 points and 11
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers employed the same strategy they used in Game 1, but
with much different results. They lost the opener 109-94 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We added a little bit more aggression,'' said Brian Grant,
whose defense on Shaquille O'Neal resulted in the Lakers center
getting 23 points, 12 rebounds and four fouls.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers scored the game's first eight points, punctuated by
Pippen's slam dunk off a steal by Steve Smith. That quieted the
crowd of 18,997 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   But Portland played its best in the third quarter, outscoring
the Lakers 28-8, which tied the Los Angeles franchise playoff
record for fewest points in a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all knew we were all going to come out with attitude.
Everybody had attitude in different areas,'' Grant said. ''We were
able to post up and kind of get them rattled. Whoever was posting
up, we just wanted to go at them hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland scored 17 points off the Lakers' 14 turnovers, while
committing just seven miscues that resulted in no points for Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Rasheed Wallace had 29 points and 12 rebounds in 46 minutes,
proving how costly his ejection after 16 minutes was in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone went out there enthusiastic and in an attack mode,''
he said. ''Coach D (Mike Dunleavy) just wanted us to try our inside
shots and rebound well.''

<HEADLINE> Ugly Third Quarter Dooms Lakers  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- For 12 minutes, the Los Angeles Lakers looked
rattled, confused, disorganized, dispirited.
</P>
<P>
   The third quarter Monday night was the ugliest period they've
played this season. And it came in one of their most important
games.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, without a doubt,'' Kobe Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was real bad,'' Shaquille O'Neal added.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never seen anything like that,'' Robert Horry said. ''You
don't know what happened, where it came from.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, trying to go up 2-0 in the Western Conference
finals, trailed Portland 48-45 at halftime. By all rights, they
should have been further behind.
</P>
<P>
   They committed 18 fouls to 11 for the Blazers, leading to 25
Portland free throw attempts to their 11; were without O'Neal for
the final 5:16 of the half due to foul problems, and benefited by
just one Portland turnover in the opening 24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   So they had reason to be optimistic at the start of the third
quarter. Instead, they were blown out en route to their first
meaningful loss at Staples Center in exactly four months.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just one game, we've got to keep going,'' Horry said
after the Trail Blazers outscored the Lakers 28-8 in the third
quarter en route to their 106-77 victory -- the most one-sided loss
of the year for Los Angeles. ''That's why we play seven.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers had won 24 of 25 home games, including seven straight
in the playoffs, since a 95-91 loss to Portland on Jan. 22. The one
loss was a 98-80 setback to San Antonio on April 8 in a game that
came after the Lakers had clinched homecourt advantage throughout
the playoffs. In addition, O'Neal sat out the game due to a
sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Rasheed Wallace had 11 of his 29 points and five of his 12
rebounds in the third period, when the Lakers made only two of
their 15 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ''He came out and just demolished us,'' Horry said of Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who had 41 points in the Lakers' 109-94 series-opening
victory two days earlier, was limited to three points in the third
period. He scored 14 of his 23 points in the fourth, after the
outcome was decided.
</P>
<P>
   ''They played very aggressively, we didn't play well at all,''
O'Neal said. ''They just came in there aggressive, then got all the
calls, hit all their shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers were 11-of-19, including 4-of-7 from 3-point range
in the period.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a third quarter like their second quarter the other
day,'' said Brian Shaw, referring to the 12-minute span when the
Lakers outscored the Blazers 37-16 for a 63-42 halftime lead in
Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just shot ourselves in the foot,'' Shaw said. ''We settled
for too many jump shots. We have to execute a lot better, figure
out a better way to get it into (O'Neal). I don't think it's
something that's major. We know what we've got to do.''
</P>
<P>
   It would behoove O'Neal and the Lakers if he did a better job at
the foul line. The Blazers didn't need to employ the
''Hack-a-Shaq'' strategy they did in the first game, but O'Neal was
a brutal 5-of-17 from the foul line, making him 18-of-44 in the two
games.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shaquille had the ball inside there a number of times, but
came away empty-handed,'' Lakers coach Phil Jackson said. ''He
missed foul shots, missed shots, no calls. ... It created a
despairing kind of situation for us. I thought morality-wise, we
really fell off. We didn't keep our morale as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have three days to get their morale back -- Game 3 of
the best-of-seven series will be played Friday night in Portland.
And now the Blazers have the homecourt advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all about challenges,'' said Bryant, who made only 2-of-9
shots and finished with 12 points. ''I wouldn't play this game if
there weren't challenges. The positive is you've got to go through
adversity to be a champion.''

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Fights Domestic Opponents  </HEADLINE>
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Slobodan Milosevic has declared war
again, this time against domestic opponents challenging his
autocratic rule.
</P>
<P>
   If he wins, Yugoslavia's main republic Serbia will slide into
unabashed dictatorship. Losing could spell an end to Milosevic's
12-year autocratic rule.
</P>
<P>
   The battle began last week, when Milosevic's police seized all
main nongovernment media in Belgrade, closing down independent
radio and television stations. Police also detained hundreds of
student opposition activists who have mocked his rule in street
protests, accusing them of ''U.S.-sponsored terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown is slated to continue under a new anti-terrorist
law that is being drafted by the Milosevic-controlled Serbian
parliament. The law would permit Milosevic's government to define
all opponents as terrorists bent on toppling the regime. It could
lead to the banning of opposition parties and sentencing of their
leaders to up to 20 years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden crackdown comes ahead of local elections -- which
Milosevic's government is expected to lose -- and amid increasing
dissent. Serbs are frustrated by a rapid decline in living
standards brought on by economic mismanagement, spreading
corruption and international isolation resulting from Belgrade's
military campaigns against former partners in the Yugoslav
federation.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership in Montenegro, Yugoslavia's smaller republic, has
already turned away from Milosevic, who has been indicted by an
international court for alleged war crimes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ''Milosevic made the right calculation by concluding that it
will cost him less to increase repression, arrest opposition
leaders and occupy the media than to allow free elections which he
would certainly lose,'' said Aleksandar Tijanic, a former
information minister and prominent independent media analyst.
</P>
<P>
   The ban on Studio B radio and TV and popular B2-92 radio means
that the capital's two million people, about a fifth of
Yugoslavia's population, can no longer hear or see anything but
state propaganda praising the regime and blasting the opposition as
pro-Western ''weaklings,'' ''thieves,'' ''colonizers,'' ''toadies''
and ''cowards.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They want to turn Serbia into Cuba,'' opposition leader Goran
Svilanovic said. ''That is a very serious and very bad decision''
because it could lead to increased violence or even civil war, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In his frequent purges of the media and opponents in the past,
Milosevic attempted to legally justify his actions. Now, there are
no attempts to try to portray his crackdown -- the most severe of
his rule -- as legal.
</P>
<P>
   Bombed by NATO last year and with diplomatic relations severed
with the leading Western countries, Milosevic no longer heeds
Western criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people in the government had hesitated because of the
West. But why should we hesitate? They bombed our children,''
explained Serbia's ultranationalist Vice Prime Minister, Vojislav
Seselj.
</P>
<P>
   Next to be arrested are likely to be top opposition leaders,
including Vuk Draskovic, whom the authorities accused of calling
for an uprising against Milosevic at a recent rally in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The call for a popular rebellion was the official reason why
Studio B -- which carried Draskovic's words -- was seized.
</P>
<P>
   The media crackdown has triggered bloody street clashes between
baton-wielding riot police and thousands of rock-throwing
opposition supporters in the capital, with the security forces
using unprecedented force to quell the unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the way Milosevic intends to rule Serbia in the next
two, three years,'' Tijanic said. ''Milosevic is warning the Serbs
that there is no peaceful split between him and Serbia.''

Guerrillas Take Over S. Lebanon Town
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MANSOURI, Lebanon (AP) -- Lebanese guerrillas and their jubilant civilian
sympathizers swept into a major town Tuesday in the disintegrating Israeli
occupation zone in southern Lebanon. The Israeli army, expected to complete its
withdrawal from Lebanon over the next few days, said its troops abandoned its
western sector headquarters in Bint Jbeil overnight. Bint Jbeil, the second
largest town in the occupation zone, was the last major Shiite Muslim town the
Israelis and its Lebanese militia allies have held since establishing the zone
in 1985 to protect northern Israel from guerrilla attack.

the battle was not over. With 218 votes needed for passage, the Clinton
administration and its allies in Congress were believed to be eight to 10 votes
short. Attention shifts Tuesday to the House Rules Committee, which will frame
the terms and length of Wednesday's debate. Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., the

<HEADLINE> NOW Attacks Fox on Women Portrayal  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In its first study of how television portrayed
women, the National Organization for Women took aim at the network
that aired ''Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   NOW declared Fox the ''network of shame'' on Monday, even though
it had praise for some of its best-known shows, like ''The
Simpsons'' and ''Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the four largest broadcast networks, NBC got the highest
marks from NOW.
</P>
<P>
   Fox ranked at the bottom for the number of women it depicted in
its lineup, the sexual exploitation of women and the amount of
socially responsible programming, said NOW President Patricia
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a heads-up to Fox but really all of the networks that
we're watching,'' Ireland said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox had no comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
   NOW ranked ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox, using its own subjective
criteria and its own volunteers, based on all the programs shown
during the February ratings sweeps period. It did not rank UPN or
the WB, networks that appeal primarily to young men and women.
</P>
<P>
   NBC received a B-plus on NOW's prime-time report card, CBS had a
C-plus, ABC was given a C and Fox had a D-plus.
</P>
<P>
   The study coincided with Fox's ill-fated ''Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire'' special with 50 women competing to marry a
wealthy stranger. That show just missed being ranked at the bottom
of NOW's list; the group found CBS's movie on JonBenet Ramsey,
''Perfect Murder, Perfect Town,'' to be the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Fox was also criticized for shows like ''Cops'' and its airing
of the movies ''Independence Day'' and ''The Nutty Professor.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC's dramas scored particularly high, and Ireland praised ''The
West Wing'' and the press secretary character played by Allison
Janney.
</P>
<P>
   CBS's ''Family Law'' received the top score.
</P>
<P>
   NOW had praise for many of network television's dramas but said
that in comedy, women were too often used as the targets for sexual
comments and advances. Many NOW analysts noted ''the abundance of
young, beautiful, thin, white women'' in comedy, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland said she hoped to set up meetings with advertisers to
let them know the type of material NOW considered objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   She also criticized ABC's ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' for
a lack of women and minority contestants and suggested that its
producers use some form of affirmative action to make the show more
representative of the public at large.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts on
Monday criticized the major television networks for including few
Hispanic characters on programs set for the fall schedule.

<HEADLINE> Sex Stations Cheer Court Ruling  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Operators of sex-oriented cable TV channels
figure the nation's highest court has helped them get into more
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy Television, Spice and The Hot Network welcomed a Supreme
Court decision Monday that struck down a law forcing many cable
operators to restrict sexually oriented material to late-night
hours.
</P>
<P>
   The law required cable operators to fully block such programming
to nonsubscribers during daylight hours. But since many cable
systems lacked the technology to guarantee that the sound and
pictures on sexually explicit programs would be completely
scrambled, they opted to restrict these networks to airing only
between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''It put carriage of our network in jeopardy in a number of
places,'' said Tony Lynn, president of the Playboy Entertainment
Group.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy operates four separate adult-oriented stations,
including Playboy Television and Spice. The largest, Playboy TV, is
available in 20 million homes, 13 million with cable and the rest
with satellite dishes, Lynn said. There are about 100 million
television homes in the country, 76 million with cable or satellite
dishes.
</P>
<P>
   The law didn't affect what the stations put on the air. However,
Playboy TV had to make certain it had programming that started at
10 p.m. in every time zone so no one was joining something in
progress, Lynn said.
</P>
<P>
   About 26 million homes -- 10 million of them cable -- get The Hot
Network or The Hot Zones, channels operated by Vivid Entertainment.
Bill Asher, company president, said the law caused some cable
operators to shy away from his programming.
</P>
<P>
   Partly as a result, Vivid has tried to grow its business among
satellite customers or on cable systems with up-to-date, digital
technology that could be more effectively scrambled, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''For us, this was a nuisance,'' Asher said. ''We believe the
new technology will solve our problems better than the Supreme
Court will.''
</P>
<P>
   Asher said he expected his competitors at Playboy to see the
most immediate benefits from the court decision. Since Playboy airs
less explicit material than Vivid's channels, its networks will be
more attractive to cable systems that have shied away from the
programming, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear how quickly cable systems that
carry these networks would begin showing them outside the 10 p.m.
to 6 a.m. timeframe.
</P>
<P>
   The decision should also eliminate an oddity that often angered
Playboy's Lynn. His company would occasionally sell some of its
programming to pay cable competitors like Cinemax or Showtime
which, because they were not considered sexually oriented channels,
could air the material at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ''We always felt that logic was on our side in this battle,''
Lynn said.

<HEADLINE> State AFL-CIO boss asks Connecticut members to boycott blood drives </HEADLINE>
sdhofonrhsy
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The state blood-collection arm of the
American Red Cross and striking workers are set to return to the
bargaining table this week.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the Connecticut AFL-CIO wants the union's
265,000 members to boycott blood drives until the contract dispute
is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their strike is our strike,'' AFL-CIO President John Olsen
said Monday. ''Their struggle is our struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   The 200 members of the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees Local 3145 walked out May 1 when the old
contract expired. No talks have been held since the second week of
the strike, but negotiations were scheduled to resume at 1 p.m. on
Thursday at a site yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still at an impasse,'' said Red Cross spokeswoman Lynn
Townshend.
</P>
<P>
   Townshend said she was disappointed ''that anyone would try to
hinder blood donations in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the Red Cross was attempting to stick to its revised
schedule of one blood drive per day. Since the strike began, Red
Cross officials said the average daily blood collection has
dwindled to about 100 pints, down from 600 units a day.
</P>
<P>
   But the Red Cross says it can still meet the blood-product
demands of 32 Connecticut hospitals by using blood collected
outside the state and managed by the Red Cross system from St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's blood drive was held at the First Presbyterian Church
in New Canaan, Townshend said. Olsen said he hoped no AFL-CIO
member would take part.
</P>
<P>
   ''This strike is about fairness,'' he said. ''It's about workers
who have every right to improve the quality of their own lives when
they've been improving the quality of all our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The union is seeking better pay, benefits, scheduling and
retirement packages. Current pay ranges from $10 to $22 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The strikers say the Red Cross receives $1,000 for each pint of
blood it collects, once the blood is broken down into its various
components. Townshend wouldn't say how much the Red Cross makes on
a pint of blood but did say the union's estimate was ''a bit
high.''
</P>
<P>
   The strike marks the second time the union has walked out
against the Red Cross. The first strike, which occurred in 1975
when AFSCME organized the Red Cross, lasted for two months.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Host Dinner for Mbeki  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Awash in a sea of blooms beckoning a new
season, President Clinton and South African President Thabo Mbeki
celebrated the ties of their two governments in a state dinner that
brought together Washington's elite with Hollywood's most famous.
</P>
<P>
   It was a who's who list of guests to honor the South African
leader: singers Harry Belafonte, Stevie Wonder and Lenny Kravitz,
Republican Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah and William Frist of Tennessee
along with director Spike Lee and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Guests entered the South Lawn Pavilion to a ''blush of summer''
with at least 50 peonies adorning each table. The menu included
several South African-inspired dishes.
</P>
<P>
   ''A great deal unites South Africa and the United States,''
Clinton said. ''This relationship between our two countries is a
very special thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki praised Clinton for a recent law expanding trade with
Africa and said, ''That friendship is getting closer and closer.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a departure from serious talks the two held earlier on
AIDS prevention and treatment in South Africa, where one in 10 are
affected by the disease. Mbeki has come under criticism for his
positions on AIDS treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday night there was little hint of that debate as
officials marked Mbeki's first visit to Washington since succeeding
Nelson Mandela as South Africa's president.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner also served as a respite for Hillary Rodham Clinton,
who broke off campaigning for the Senate from New York to attend.
Mrs. Clinton, wearing a black Pamela Dennis gown, appeared relaxed
and chatted with several guests.
</P>
<P>
   The White House chose a lavish affair to host the South African
delegation, inviting some 360 guests to sample fare that included
green and white asparagus, wild leek marinated lobster, herbed
spring vegetables and apricot ginger glazed lamb, complete with
African spices. For dessert, there was pineapple surprise
Queenstown, an ice cream sherbet treat named for the South African
town that boasts several pineapple farms.
</P>
<P>
   Guests were entertained by pianist Awadagin Pratt, who played
several selections previously recorded live in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The event was one of the largest dinners in the Clinton White
House, officials said. The receiving line lasted more than an hour.
Even the president clapped when it ended.
</P>
<P>
   The indoor setting defied the dreary tug of war between spring
and summer that left Washington with cool temperatures and an
incessant drizzle.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the heavily draped pavilion, the tables burst with color
of their own with centerpieces of blush, pink and burgundy peonies
surrounded by assorted crystal votive candles.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoors, everything from the blossoming dogwood trees to the
outdoor fountain was adorned with white lights.
</P>
<P>
   So guests wouldn't face the risk of raindrops, trolleys were
brought in to ferry them.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Mbeki presented Clinton, an avid coin
collector, with a set of four 24-karat coins produced by the South
African Mint. The president gave Mbeki a specially designed Tiffany
sterling silver cache pot with an engraved inscription.

<HEADLINE> New York cancer incidence and mortality analyzed at Roswell Park  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Cancer screening programs appear to be
paying off according to a study completed by the Roswell Park
Cancer Institute that examined 20 years of cancer incidence and
mortality data.
</P>
<P>
   Mortality rates from several common cancers, such as breast and
colorectal cancers, have actually gone down, according to the
study. But the study also cites an increase in the incidence of
cancer in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the cancer incidence rate in New York state was found
to have increased by 22 percent among men and 15 percent among
women between 1980 and 1994. But the cancer mortality rate
decreased by 3 percent among men and 1 percent among women between
1980 and 1994, according to the study. The cancer mortality rate
for males was about 10 percent greater than for females.
</P>
<P>
   State health officials agreed with the authors of the study that
a statistical decrease has to do with a greater number of people
being screened for the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe the decrease has to do with more prevalent and
agressive screening,'' said Dr. Maria Schymura, director of New
York state Cancer Registry.
</P>
<P>
   The study is the result of an analysis of 24 types of cancer
occurring in men and women in New York state from 1975-1994 done at
Roswell Park. Andrew Hyland, Ph.D., and his research team from the
Department of Cancer Prevention, Epidemiology and Biostatistics at
RPCI, conducted the study.
</P>
<P>
   ''The data are intended to give the public and policy-makers a
sense of how cancer rates have changed over time so that health
care resources can be appropriately allocated to areas where the
greatest utility can be gained,'' Hyland said.
</P>
<P>
   The study analyzed cancer incidence data by county that was
provided by the New York State Cancer Registry. Also analyzed were
cancer and mortality statistics from 1980-1994 provided by the New
York State Department of Vital Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Roswell Park, begun in 1898, was the first center in the world
that linked laboratory discoveries with patient care and
professional and public education.
</P>
<P>
   Roswell Park employs more than 2,100 people, including 100
physicians and 100 senior scientists.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Open Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened lower as analysts say
it's something of a toss-up for today's market session. The Dow
Jones industrial average is down 20 points so far. Advancing issues
on the New York Stock Exchange hold a six-to-five lead over
decliners. And the Nasdaq composite index is off 17 points, while
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index is down 2 points.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, the market may have some upward momentum going for
it today, given that it staged a late recovery yesterday, nearly
eclipsing steep, early losses.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, with nothing new to steer traders, the same
interest rate worries that have made for volatile trading lately
remain in place.
</P>
<P>
   There are no economic reports due today. And there's very little
in the way of corporate news or earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices are modestly lower. Stocks remain mostly higher in
Europe.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower in early trading today
as investors moved cautiously in the wake of Monday's volatile
session. Interest rate worries once again prevented investors from
mustering much enthusiasm for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 47.64 at 10,494.91.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also fell. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 10.20 at 1,390.52, and the Nasdaq composite index
was down 47.04 at 3,317.17.
</P>
<P>
   Investors demonstrated little conviction and barely any interest
in bargain-hunting. On Monday, both the Dow and the Nasdaq fell
more than 200 points at midday before clawing back to more modest
losses.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors salvaged Monday's market by buying
stocks that had been knocked down to bargain prices. The market's
failure to rally today indicates true malaise, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   Leading technology companies continued their long, steady slide.
Cisco Systems fell 1 5/16 to 53 15/16, Intel fell 1 5/16 to 117
1/16 and Oracle fell 2 11/16 to 65[.
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell, a Dow component, rose 1{ to 54}. PaineWebber analyst
David Bleustein launched coverage on the stock with a ''buy''
rating. Bleustein applauded Honeywell's efforts to capitalize on
the technological innovations that are driving the so-called new
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a handful of stocks on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 112.65 million
shares, ahead of Monday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies slipped 1.89 to
469.78.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.4 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's Xetra DAX index was down 0.2 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
down 0.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Chief state's attorney takes over murder probe  </HEADLINE>
syhfcflsrh
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- The chief state's attorney's office has
taken over the investigation into a 1996 slaying amid allegations
New Haven police protected a suspect with ties to a city detective.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is already leading a grand jury investigation into
the police department's handling of the murder of Philip Cusick,
who was found in front of his North Haven home Nov. 6, 1996. Police
suspect he was shot in New Haven. North Haven police have made no
arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury is trying to determine whether high-ranking
members of the New Haven Police Department failed to tell North
Haven police that they had identified a suspect in Cusick's death.
</P>
<P>
   That suspect is the half brother of Arosmo Diaz, a police
informant and Latin Kings gang member who was killed along with a
New Haven detective's son in a 1994 gang-related shooting in
Bridgeport, The Hartford Courant reported today.
</P>
<P>
   The Courant, citing sources it did not identify, said Diaz was
killed because of his links to police and 22-year-old Tyler White,
the son of New Haven detective Lt. William White, was in the wrong
place at the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   Two Bridgeport men are serving time in federal prison for the
murders, which sparked a federal, local and state crackdown on the
Latin Kings and the convictions of 33 gang members in Bridgeport
and New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   New Haven Sgt. Edward Kendall, a member of a Latin Kings task
force, has been called to testify before the grand jury. Kendall
said he lost the transcript of a taped interview with a potential
witness for a year when he got sidetracked by other cases, the New
Haven Register has reported.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall did not return calls seeking comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   White said Monday that authorities have not asked him about the
North Haven murder or any connection to his son's case.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can call me (to testify) or do whatever they want because
I don't know anything about that,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   The chief state's attorney's office may use the grand jury to
obtain an indictment in Cusick's slaying. At least one other man,
who was with Cusick the night of the killing, also has been
investigated.
</P>
<P>
   New Haven State's Attorney Michael Dearington launched his own
inquiry into the Cusick case in March. Inspectors with Dearington's
office interviewed several city police officers and supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   When the probe stalled several weeks ago, Dearington applied for
an investigative grand jury. He then transferred the investigation
to the office of the chief state's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Dearington could not be reached for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Carmen Elisa Espinosa was appointed to act as a one-person
grand jury two weeks ago and is hearing evidence behind closed
doors in New Britain Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   The New Haven Police Department is conducting an internal
affairs investigation.

<HEADLINE> Army Changes Choice for Deputy IG  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army has quietly dropped plans to make
Maj. Gen. Larry G. Smith the service's deputy inspector general,
two months after word leaked that he been accused of sexual
harassment by the Army's highest-ranking female officer.
</P>
<P>
   In an internal notice dated Friday, in which it listed several
new assignments for general officers, the Army said Maj. Gen.
Joseph R. Inge had been selected to be deputy inspector general. He
is commanding general of the U.S. Army Japan/9th Theater Army Area
Command.
</P>
<P>
   The list made no mention of Smith, whose status has been
officially described as ''on hold'' since November. He was
announced Aug. 27 as the next deputy inspector general, but he
never took the post.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is working at the Army Materiel Command in Alexandria, Va.
He reportedly is contesting Lt. Gen. Claudia Kennedy's allegation.
Neither he nor Kennedy has publicly commented on the case, although
Kennedy's associates have said she made her complaint against Smith
out of concern that he would be an inappropriate choice for a
position that is responsible for investigating accusations of
sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter's call today to Kennedy's office, seeking her comment
on the decision to rescind Smith's appointment, was referred to the
Army public affairs office, where Maj. Thomas Collins said, ''Army
general officers do not comment on the assignment of other general
officers, unless they supervise them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army has never confirmed that it was investigating Smith,
although sources said two weeks ago that Army investigators had
substantiated the charge that he touched Kennedy in a sexual way in
her Pentagon office in 1996. The Army has taken no action in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Kanellis, an Army spokeswoman, said today she could not
comment on what the Inge assignment means for Smith's status and
future in the Army. Asked why Smith was dropped from the post, she
said ''he is unavailable to fill the position'' and Army leaders
felt this was the right time to fill it.
</P>
<P>
   A call to Smith's military attorney was not immediately
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, the Army's deputy chief of staff for intelligence, is
due to retire this summer. Last week the Pentagon announced that
President Clinton had nominated Maj. Gen. Robert W. Noonan to take
Kennedy's slot. Noonan is commander of the U.S. Army Intelligence
and Security Command at Fort Belvoir, Va.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Vote on FEC Nominee  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate leaders today agreed to a vote on a
Federal Election Commission nominee who opposes campaign spending
limits, clearing a logjam of Clinton nominations.
</P>
<P>
   FEC nominee Bradley Smith of Ohio, who raised the ire of
Democrats and campaign reform advocates with his statement that
government should not limit the size of campaign contributions,
will be voted on by the Republican-controlled Senate on Wednesday,
said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who teaches at Capital University Law School in Columbus,
Ohio, said Monday he feels confident of his chances if he gets a
vote. ''I think everybody agrees a majority of the Senate would
vote to confirm me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, R-Miss., and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.,
agreed last week to a vote on Smith in exchange for getting 16
federal judicial nominees and several other Clinton nominations
through the Senate. But the agreement was derailed Monday after
some Democrats refused to start the debate, complaining that most
of the senators had not yet returned to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said today an agreement had been reached to start 10 hours
of Smith debate today with the vote coming Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, most of the 64 nominations stuck in the Senate
would be cleared, with votes only on one other FEC board member,
Danny McDonald, and two judges, Timothy Dyk, who wants to be a U.S.
Circuit Court judge in the District of Columbia and Gerald Lynch,
who was nominated to be a U.S. District judge in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has been the bargaining chip for Democrats to get some of
President Clinton's judicial nominations through the Senate.
Republicans, looking to regain the White House after eight years of
Clinton's presidency, have done little this year to expedite
approval of Clinton's nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Only seven judges have been approved by the Senate this year. In
addition to the 16 on the Senate calendar, 36 are awaiting approval
by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats and campaign reform advocates say Smith is an
unacceptable choice for the FEC because of his belief that
government should not limit the size of campaign contributions. At
his confirmation hearing, Smith told senators he would enforce
campaign law as it is rather than as he wishes it would be but that
assurance failed to placate his foes.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled to debate Smith are Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., who
Democrats said Monday was the main holdup to the beginning of the
debate, and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who made campaign reform the
centerpiece of his failed presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Other nominations that had been stuck because of the Smith
controversy include positions at the State, Justice and Treasury
departments and seats on the Harry Truman Scholarship Foundation
and even the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The only nominations not yet cleared for confirmation are seven
members of the Internal Revenue Service Oversight Board and a
member of the Morris K. Udall Scholarship &AMP; Excellence in National
Environmental Policy Foundation.

<HEADLINE> Vote Narrows on Landmark China Bill  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Both sides stepped up a lobbying blitz on the
eve of House debate over whether to liberalize trade ties with
China. Supporters cautiously predicted victory, while labor unions
and other opponents insisted the battle was not over.
</P>
<P>
   With 218 votes needed for passage, the Clinton administration
and its allies in Congress were believed to be eight to 10 votes
short.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel it's working our way,'' Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif.,
the administration's point man among Democrats, said late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Attention shifted today to the House Rules Committee, which will
frame the terms and length of Wednesday's debate. Rep. David
Dreier, R-Calif., the committee chairman, said he hopes for a final
vote Wednesday as well.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic and Republican vote counters said the outcome may not
be known until the final House roll call is under way. Both sides
fished in a dwindling pool of undecided members.
</P>
<P>
   China trade advocates -- which includes much of corporate America
-- suggested they would prevail if they could just obtain the
support of at least half the remaining fence-sitters. But no one
suggested the vote would be anything other than extremely close.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are getting close,'' President Clinton said in a Monday
night NBC interview. ''I am optimistic, but boy, we have got a lot
of work to do. It's not done yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Clinton reminded lawmakers to consider future generations
before voting.
</P>
<P>
   ''The consequences of this vote will be felt after I am no
longer president,'' Clinton said. ''Our country fought three wars
in Asia in the last half-century. We ought to give our children a
chance to have a different 50 years ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, meanwhile, told a union group that he
knows organized labor opposes the bill but ''I don't share that
view.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I strongly support normal trade relations with China because I
believe it is right for America's economy and right for the cause
of reform in China,'' the Democratic presidential candidate told
about 150 United Food and Commercial Workers members in Washington
to lobby against the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''Neither side has the votes now,'' asserted Rep. Frank Wolf,
R-Va., a leading opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would grant China permanent normal trading relations as
part of its impending entry into the World Trade Organization, the
Geneva-based organization that sets rules for trade and adjudicates
disputes among members.
</P>
<P>
   In return for America's support for its bid to join the WTO,
China would dismantle barriers that U.S. corporations and farmers
have long complained about.
</P>
<P>
   China will enter the WTO whatever happens.
</P>
<P>
   In related matters Monday:
</P>
<P>
   --Wolf made public a letter from the General Accounting Office,
the investigatory branch of Congress, suggesting that a group
formed by the Clinton administration to help lobby for the bill may
have violated a federal anti-lobbying law. GAO General Counsel
Robert P. Murphy cited a single e-mail message from a unit of the
China Trade Relations Group to two farmers' organizations urging
their members to contact lawmakers in support of the legislation.
However, Murphy said a ''negligible'' amount of federal funds was
involved and that the violation ''was minimal and does not warrant
further action on our part or a referral to the Justice
Department.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wolf, said, ''the law is clear about using federal
employees and federal resources for lobbying Congress -- it's
illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   -- A U.S. International Trade Commission report indicates the
China trade bill would make the already huge U.S. trade deficit
with China even worse, not better. That deficit hit a record $68.7
billion last year, the largest for any country other than Japan.
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, who requested the
review, called the finished product ''a very incomplete study, and
to be frank, not much utilized.'' But opponents used the report to
project that the China deal would result in the loss of 872,000
American jobs over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press survey showed that as of late Monday, about
80 House members still wanted to be listed as ''undecided.''
However, vote counters on both sides said the actual undecided vote
-- counting those that have given private pledges -- was closer to
15-20.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters on Monday picked up at least two formerly undecided
Republicans -- Tom Campbell of California and Jim DeMint of South
Carolina. Today, they expected to win the endorsement of Gregory
Meeks, D-N.Y., said Democratic source who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, meanwhile, picked up Republican Reps. Steven C.
LaTourette of Ohio and Merrill Cook of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ''I decided to listen to my conscience and my district and vote
'no,''' LaTourette said.
</P>
<P>
   The House Rules Committee was expected to merge the permanent
trade relations bill with two measures designed to make the
legislation more palatable to wavering members. These are proposals
by Reps. Sander Levin, D-Mich., and Doug Bereuter, R-Neb., for a
commission to monitor human rights in China and for more protection
to U.S. companies from surges in Chinese imports.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bills are H.R. 4444 and S. 2277

<HEADLINE> White House, Hastert OK Renew Deal  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Six months after pledging to work together to
help impoverished areas, President Clinton and House Speaker Dennis
Hastert today unveiled their handiwork, a multibillion-dollar
package of tax breaks and other incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have achieved an agreement that will allow us to give every
family in every community a stake in the prosperity Americans have
worked so hard to build,'' Clinton said in a joint appearance with
Hastert in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Putting aside differences on other issues, the two leaders
praised each other. ''This is a happy day,'' Clinton said. ''It
would not have been possible if it hadn't been for the speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert said, ''We can do a lot of good things together.'' There
was a bipartisan show of support as Republican and Democratic
members of Congress applauded the accord.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's top economics adviser, Gene Sperling, said, ''This
will be one of the most important pieces of legislation for
bringing investment and capital into low-income areas that has been
passed in decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said aides were still calculating the total cost of the
proposed legislation to be trumpeted at today's White House
ceremony. He put the initial estimate at $5 billion to $7 billion
over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is a blend of Clinton's proposed ''new markets''
initiative and Hastert's call for 40 renewal communities.
</P>
<P>
   Certain capital gains taxes would be eliminated in these areas,
to be called ''Renewal Communities,'' and businesses would be
eligible for a credit on some wages as well certain expenses
related to environmental cleanup, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said an existing program of empowerment zones, also
designed to help economically distressed areas, would be expanded
in size and in scope.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also calls for a ''new markets tax credit'' for
taxpayers who invest in low income areas, whether the empowerment
zones or the new renewal communities, a provision the White House
had sought as energetically as Republicans pressed for the zero
capital gains tax.
</P>
<P>
   Another area of agreement would make churches and other
so-called faith-based institutions eligible to receive federal
grants to run substance abuse programs. Aides said this provision
would apply throughout the nation, regardless of whether the
program was operated inside a distressed area.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has toured the country to dramatize the plight of
communities left behind in the current economic expansion. For his
part, Hastert visited the Chicago district of Rep. Danny Davis,
D-Ill., to underscore his own interest in attacking poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The president and the speaker appeared together in Chicago in
November -- during a partisan budget battle -- and pledged to work
together on an effort to alleviate economic distress.
</P>
<P>
   They have negotiated in the months since, through aides as well
as in person. According to aides to both men, Hastert handed the
president his most recent in a series of back-and-forth offers last
week, when the two men were together for the signing of trade
legislation relating to Africa and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement comes only a few days before the House is
scheduled to vote on legislation granting permanent normal trade
relations with China. Aides refused to speculate Monday night on
the impact of the agreement -- likely to benefit the districts of
many members of the Congressional Black Caucus -- on the China vote.
</P>
<P>
   Several black caucus members are on a list of Democrats who
remain uncommitted on the China measure, which is expected to
produce a close vote in the House.
</P>
<P>
   According to material distributed by Hastert's office,
individuals would pay no capital gains on the sale of renewal
community business or business assets held for more than five
years. Small businesses would be able to take immediate deductions
for certain equipment. Businesses would receive a tax break for a
portion of the wages they pay, as well as for certain environmental
cleanup expenses. A tax deduction also would be available for
rehabilitating buildings inside the renewal community.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said the agreement calls for $200 million in increased
funding in the upcoming fiscal year for empowerment zones. The
proposal also would create nine new zones, and apply new tax
breaks, including the wage credit, to businesses that locate in any
of the existing or new zones.
</P>
<P>
   Other provisions are designed to facilitate low-income home
ownership and provide incentives for venture capital.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Faces Disbarment  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES JEFFERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Citing ''serious misconduct,'' an
Arkansas disciplinary panel has recommended that President Clinton
be disbarred for giving misleading testimony about his relationship
with Monica Lewinsky -- an unprecedented and stinging rebuke of a
sitting president.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the Arkansas Supreme Court Committee on
Professional Conduct is the first step toward stripping Clinton of
his law license and another embarrassment stemming the Paula Jones
sexual harassment case. Clinton was impeached by the House and
acquitted at a Senate trial, and he also has been fined for
contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
   A judge must decide whether to accept Monday's recommendation.
If it is accepted, the president can appeal to the state Supreme
Court -- and he said that's exactly what will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the committee -- five lawyers in private practice
and a retired schoolteacher -- was responding too harshly to
testimony that he has labeled as ''legally accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The only reason I agreed even to an appeal of this is, my
lawyers looked at all the precedents and they said, 'There's no way
in the world if they just treat you like everybody else has been
treated, that this is even close to that kind of case,''' he said
on ''NBC Nightly News.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to give the judge a chance to do what we believe
is right, and I think that's the right thing to do,'' said Clinton,
who will not personally defend himself because it would interfere
with his duties as president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been a licensed lawyer since Sept. 7, 1973, was
attorney general of Arkansas from 1977-79 and once taught at the
University of Arkansas law school. He has not practiced law since
the early 1980s, between his first and second terms as Arkansas
governor.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is his testimony in the lawsuit filed against him by
Jones, a former state employee who said Clinton exposed himself to
her and made a sexual advance in a Little Rock hotel room in 1991.
Jones lawyers' drew Lewinsky into the case in an attempt to show a
pattern of sexual misconduct by Clinton, a trail later picked up by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr that led to Clinton's
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In his January 1998 deposition, Clinton said: ''I have never had
sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky,'' explaining the
relationship did not meet the definition of sex that was given at
the start of the deposition.
</P>
<P>
   However, he acknowledged on Aug. 17, 1998, before a federal
grand jury -- and again in a nationally televised address -- that he
had an inappropriate relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative Southeastern Legal Foundation and U.S. District
Judge Susan Webber Wright, who presided over the Jones case, filed
complaints against Clinton with the Arkansas committee.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation wanted Clinton disbarred; Wright -- who last year
cited Clinton for contempt and fined him $90,000 for giving
''intentionally false'' testimony -- did not suggest a specific
penalty from the panel. Wright dismissed the Jones lawsuit, which
was later settled on appeal by Clinton for $850,000 without any
admission of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the state Supreme Court, committee executive
director James Neal, said the disbarment recommendation was ''a
result of the formal complaints ... and the findings by a majority
of the committee that certain of the attorney's conduct, as
demonstrated in the complaint, constituted serious misconduct,'' in
violation of state rules governing lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Committee chairman Ken Reeves said that committee members
''voted their convictions.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, it would have been easier to do something less,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Glavin, president of the Southeastern Legal Foundation,
applauded the committee's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a confirmation that the legal system will police its
own, regardless of the position held by the attorney in question,''
he said. ''Remember, this is the first time in American history
that a sitting president faced disciplinary proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   President Nixon was disbarred by a New York court after
resigning in 1974 over the Watergate scandal. In its reply to
Clinton's argument against disciplinary action, the foundation
cited the Nixon case.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for Jones, Gilbert K. Davis, said the disbarment
ruling was a ''victory for all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I look at it as a benefit to the judicial system,'' he said.
''Courts don't have police and armies to enforce their policies.
It's an important lesson that needs to be driven home to Americans,
that we value this system.''
</P>
<P>
   This spring, the committee said it would not consider discipline
for Hillary Rodham Clinton for work tied to the Whitewater scandal.
The Landmark Legal Foundation sought an inquiry after federal
regulators found in 1996 that Mrs. Clinton, as a lawyer in Little
Rock, created a real estate document later used by her Whitewater
partners' savings and loan to deceive federal regulators. The panel
said there was not ''a sufficient basis'' to pursue Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has 14 full-time members -- lawyers and nonlawyers
-- who sit in panels of seven. Because of Clinton's widespread
connections throughout the state, eight of the panelists bowed out
before Friday's meeting, most of them citing potential conflicts of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Of the six who heard Clinton's case, at least two are Democrats;
three have not identified their affiliation because voters are not
required to do so in Arkansas unless they want to take part in a
primary. Whether the sixth member has identified a party
affiliation could not be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said committee rules won't allow him to reveal how
individual members voted.
</P>
<P>
   Under committee rules, a disbarment complaint will be filed in
Pulaski County Circuit Court at Little Rock. Reeves said the filing
could come possibly within four to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts disagreed over the recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Akhil Amar of Yale University said disbarment ''may be a good
punishment that fits the crime,'' while impeachment and removal
from office ''was seen as disproportionate.'' However, Amar
questioned whether it would have been wiser to wait until after
Clinton left office.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Rothstein at Georgetown University said ''in my view, he
has been punished'' and the committee should have recommended a
reprimand at most.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is piling on,'' Rothstein said. ''I think he is
being punished more for his prominence.''

<HEADLINE> House Probes Secret Evidence Cases  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers on Tuesday urged the elimination of
a law that allows the Immigration and Naturalization Service to use
secret evidence in deportation hearings. INS and FBI officials
warned that such action could benefit terrorists and compromise
national security.
</P>
<P>
   ''Secret evidence is a national embarrassment and we need to
take action,'' said Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., a chief sponsor
with Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Bonior, a leading House liberal, is also joined by fellow
liberal Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., and conservative Rep. Bob Barr,
R-Ga., in seeking a change in a 1996 anti-terrorism act that gives
the INS the authority to arrest, detain and deport non-citizens
based on evidence not revealed to the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   ''This violates our deepest faith in the right to due process
and violates our democracy's most sacred document, the United
States Constitution,'' Campbell told a House Judiciary Committee
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Also testifying was Nahla Al-Arian, an American of Palestinian
descent whose brother, former professor Mazen Al-Najjar, has been
imprisoned for three years on secret evidence that federal
officials say connect him to Palestinian terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Arian said her brother has never done or said anything that
could be construed as supporting terrorism or violence but it was
''impossible for my brother to defend himself against these
Kafkaesque proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   At his first court appearance in Miami last month, Al-Najjar's
lawyers argued that it was unconstitutional to imprison a person on
the basis of evidence he can't confront or rebut. Al-Najjar, who
arrived in the United States 19 years ago and overstayed his visa,
has not been charged with any crime.
</P>
<P>
   INS and FBI officials contended that they withhold information
from court proceedings only rarely and only after the approval of
the Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General.
</P>
<P>
   ''We take these matters seriously,'' said FBI General Counsel
Larry Parkinson. ''We have found, however, that in a small number
of cases the use of such information is necessary to adequately
protect the national security.''
</P>
<P>
   INS General Counsel Bo Cooper said the proposed legislation
''will put the INS in a position of extending the privilege of
United States citizenship to those who are undeserving because they
are dangers to the national security.''
</P>
<P>
   The officials said classified evidence is involved in only 11
cases out of 300,000 pending INS cases. Supporters of the bill said
more than 20 people are currently being detained under secret
evidence, and all but one are Arabs or Muslims. They noted that in
three previous cases federal judges have ruled the use of secret
evidence unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation to prohibit the use of secret evidence in
immigration hearings is supported by such groups as the American
Civil Liberties Union and the Arab American Institute.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas Homburger of the Anti-Defamation League urged
rejection of what he said was an ''extreme measure'' because it
''does not provide the proper balance between national security
interests and individual liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 2121.

<HEADLINE> Blood donors keep giving despite strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW CANAAN, Conn. (AP) -- Labor leaders may be urging union
members not to give blood until Red Cross workers settle their
strike, but donors keep giving.
</P>
<P>
   At a blood drive at the First Presbyterian Church in New Canaan,
the public seemed intent on keeping the donations coming.
</P>
<P>
   ''Be so kind as to read this,'' a picket asked as he handed a
grievance flier to a young man pulling into the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeah, OK, sure, yeah,'' the young man replied.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes later, the man rolled up his sleeve and stretched
out on a padded table inside the church. He was the 58th person to
give blood in the first 2{ hours of the blood drive Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Blood drives have been greatly reduced by the strike -- the Red
Cross is holding only one each day, instead of the six to 12 it
usually had before the strike.
</P>
<P>
   The walkout by 200 blood collection workers, members of the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local
3145 began May 1. The workers are seeking better pay and less
hectic work schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Collections are down to about 100 pints per day from the usual
600 in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the president of the Connecticut AFL-CIO urged the
union's 265,000 members to boycott blood drives until the contract
dispute is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Castiglioni did not hesitate to drive past the picket line
at Monday's blood drive.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's troubling,'' he said of the union's call. ''People don't
stop dying on the highways because somebody goes on strike. If
someone in my family was injured, I'd want the blood supply to be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Freud said he has sympathy for the union and believes its
members have some legitimate gripes. But he said he had to donate
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ''I give blood because I think it's the right thing to do,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross officials say the shortfall in blood collection in
Connecticut has been made up by importing blood from other states.
</P>
<P>
   John Olsen, the state AFL-CIO president, tried to increase
pressure on the Red Cross through his call for a union boycott of
blood drives.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't like to go to this extreme but someone has to stand
up and say this is wrong,'' he said. ''The workers make very
little, and they live in a very expensive state.''
</P>
<P>
   The striking workers make between $10 and $22 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   National AFL-CIO President John Sweeney said the union is asking
the American Red Cross to stop transferring blood from national
inventories or other centers around the country to Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ''Support for the local facility's disregard of its workers must
not be tolerated,'' he said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Red Cross spokeswoman Lynn Townshend said the
national Red Cross office has assured Connecticut officials that it
will continue to make up the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   A negotiation session between the Red Cross and striking workers
has been set for Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Dow, Nasdaq Both Down 28  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were modestly lower today as investors
moved cautiously following Monday's volatile session. Interest rate
worries once again prevented investors from mustering much
enthusiasm for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the risks are on the table now,'' said Richard E. Cripps,
chief market strategist at Legg Mason in Baltimore. ''We have
rising interest rates, an effort to slow the economy and high
valuations. Other than than lower stock prices, there's nothing to
bring investors back.''
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 28.45 at 10,514.10.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 4.83 at 1,395.89 and the Nasdaq composite index was
down 28.09 at 3,336.12, but advancing issues outnumbered decliners
on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Investors demonstrated little conviction and barely any interest
in bargain-hunting. On Monday, both the Dow and the Nasdaq fell
more than 200 points at midday before clawing back to more modest
losses.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors salvaged Monday's market by buying
stocks that had been knocked down to bargain prices. The market's
failure to rally today indicates true malaise, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pressure to sell increases as the market goes lower,''
Cripps said. ''Traders recognize that and are unwilling to step in
front of the market and start buying.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading technology companies continued their long, steady slide.
Cisco Systems fell 5/16 to 54 15/16, Intel fell 2| to 115} and
Oracle fell 1 15/16 to 65~.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks were mostly lower, too. Amazon.com fell 2 to 49~
and eBay fell 4 15/16 to 131\.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered buying interest was concentrated in the blue-chip
stocks that dominate the Dow. Boeing rose 1\ to 37 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell, a Dow component, rose } to 54. PaineWebber analyst
David Bleustein launched coverage on the stock with a ''buy''
rating. Bleustein applauded Honeywell's efforts to capitalize on
the technological innovations that are driving the so-called new
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Advancers were ahead of decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on the
NYSE, where volume came to 565.10 million shares, slightly ahead of
Monday's moderate pace.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts are anticipating quiet trading at least
until Thursday, when the next wave of economic data hits the
market. The Commerce Department will issue its preliminary report
on first-quarter gross domestic product, and the National
Association of Realtors will report on existing home sales for
April.
</P>
<P>
   Both reports could offer some indication of whether the Federal
Reserve's six interest rate increases in the past 11 months are
successfully slowing the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.23 to 471.90.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Rejects Russia's Nuke Idea  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As President Clinton prepares for next month's
U.S.-Russia summit, the Pentagon rejected Moscow's idea of cutting
the nuclear arsenals of each country to 1,500 warheads.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told the Senate
Armed Forces Committee on Tuesday that they are uncomfortable with
reducing strategic nuclear weapons below the START III limit
approved in 1997 by Clinton and then-president Boris Yeltsin in
Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has 7,200 strategic nuclear warheads ready for
immediate use, and Russia has 6,000. The START II agreement, which
Russia just ratified, will reduce arsenals to between 3,000 and
3,500 each by 2007. And the START III would cut them again to
between 2,000 and 2,500. Russia has suggested deeper cuts -- to
about 1,500 warheads per side.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Joint Chiefs support Helsinki,'' Gen. Henry R. Shelton,
chairman of the joint chiefs told the panel.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am quite comfortable with the Helsinki framework,'' said
Adm. Jay L. Johnson, chief of Naval Operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we wanted to depart from that ... then we need to pause and
do the necessary analysis'' to assure U.S. security and deterrence
would still be just as strong or stronger, said Shelton.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have said they will hold to the current
level as well in the June 4-5 summit between Clinton and President
Vladimir Putin. But there has been speculation among analysts and
the press that the United States might agree to the lower level in
exchange for a Russian agreement to amend the Anti-Ballistic
Missile treaty enough for Washington to deploy a national missile
defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to make a decision in the coming months on
whether to deploy a system that some say is needed against attacks
by so-called rogue states like Iran and North Korea. Russia is
among nations opposed to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''Should the Senate be concerned that the United States may be
pressing ahead toward a START III agreement without having
conducted a recent comprehensive review of our strategic nuclear
... requirements?'' Committee Chairman Sen. John Warner asked as he
opened Tuesday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I respect the constitutional duties of our president to
conduct foreign affairs ... but we have our role to play as well,''
he said, adding that the Clinton administration ''has attempted too
often to circumvent the Senate on a range of armed control
agreements.''

<HEADLINE> Willimantic festival in doubt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WILLIMANTIC, Conn. (AP) -- Another major sponsor is needed to
save the town's annual hot-air balloon festival -- and soon.
</P>
<P>
   Unless an additional title sponsor or sponsors can be found by
Friday, ''it's possible we may not have the festival,'' said
Michael Paulhus, vice president of the Greater Windham Community
Foundation and chairman of the Connecticut Festival of Ballooning.
</P>
<P>
   Paulhus said festival organizers are ''pretty close'' to the
fund-raising target, but lack some $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee Gas will again be the event's title sponsor. But another
major sponsor is not offering as much support this year.
</P>
<P>
   Paulhus said even with a reduction in expenses, organizers need
a total of $60,000 in sponsorship money. It costs between $130,000
and $140,000 to mount the festival.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a safety margin to make sure expenses are covered,''
he explained. ''This is a weather-dependent event.''
</P>
<P>
   Last August, the first year the 5-year-old festival was
sponsored by the foundation, bad weather both Friday evening and
Saturday kept the crowds down. Nevertheless, 8,000 people attended
the three-day festival and the event broke even.
</P>
<P>
   The three previous balloon festivals were in 1995, 1996 and
1997. The foundation opted not to hold a festival in 1998, after
taking over from an out-of-state group.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing has been determined at this time,'' said foundation
President Rheo Brouillard. ''Friday morning, we'll meet and decide
whether or not the sponsorship level is high enough to go ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   If the sponsorships are not at last year's level, ''we will not
go ahead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The event is scheduled for Aug. 18-20. Windham First Selectman
John Lescoe said there is no money in the town budget to help the
foundation out. All the town can provide is in-kind services.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it will go on again this
year,'' he said. ''It's such a great event and does so much for
this community.''

<HEADLINE> Lieberman campaigns for Sound preservation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman plans public
hearings for Long Island Sound residents to hear their ideas on
preserving millions of acres of the surrounding countryside.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut Democrat plans to introduce legislation next
year to create a Long Island Sound Reserve. Meetings, dubbed Listen
to the Sound 2000, will be held from May 30 to June 29 in
Connecticut and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have come a long way toward cleaning up the Sound, but the
die-off of lobsters reminds us this is a living and fragile body of
water and a lot still needs to be done,'' Lieberman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   John Atkin, president of the nonprofit Save the Sound, praised
Lieberman as one of the only lawmakers in Washington who
understands the importance of continued conservation efforts on the
Sound. Atkin began discussing the creation of a reserve with
Lieberman about a year ago and has since been working with his
staff to refine the concept, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The reserve would be a system of permanently protected open
space and underwater lands that would safeguard habitat and water
quality and improve public access. Although details are still being
developed, the concept includes educating the public and working
with business and property owners to reduce pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition -- which includes The National Audubon Society and
the Connecticut office of Regional Plan Association, a tri-state
land-use and transportation planning organization -- also hopes to
purchase waterfront land and restore deteriorating public lands,
said Meg Tocantins, a spokeswoman for Save the Sound.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve those goals, nonprofit organizations, government
officials and the public have to work together, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want people to come out and say, 'This is what I'm worried
about,' '' Tocantins said. ''We want people to say they actually
want this.''
</P>
<P>
   About 25 million people -- or 10 percent of the nation's
population -- live in the area surrounding the Sound. About
two-thirds of the land is developed, which has led to the
degradation of wetlands, watershed and water, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The states of Connecticut and New York have committed about $500
million toward restoring the Sound, said William Cooke, director of
government relations with the New York office of The Audubon
Society. Federal money has been used to restore the Everglades in
Florida, Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and other shoreline areas, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's our turn,'' Cooke said. ''All we are looking for is our
share.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sound's marine life and shorebird populations have declined
dramatically as a result of development and pollution, Cooke said.
Significant progress has been made in the last decade, he said, but
''the race is not won yet.''
</P>
<P>
   A report on the hearings is expected to be completed in the
fall.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jets Bomb Iraqi Military  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- U.S. aircraft bombed defense sites in
northern Iraq on Tuesday in response to Iraqi anti-aircraft fire,
the U.S. military said.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation began when Iraqi gunners fired on warplanes
enforcing a northern no-fly zone from sites near Bashiqah and
Mosul, some 250 miles north of Baghdad, the U.S. European Command
said from Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The jets returned to Incirlik air base in southern Turkey
without any losses, it said. U.S. warplanes also bombed a military
site near Bashiqah on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   An unidentified Iraqi military spokesman told the Iraqi News
Agency that ''enemy warplanes bombed civil and service
installations in the northern part of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft fire have forced
the attacking warplanes to flee, he said. The spokesman did not say
whether there were any casualties or give the exact location of the
sites bombed in northern Iraq Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain have been enforcing northern and
southern no-fly zones in Iraq since the end of the 1991 Persian
Gulf War. Iraq says the zones violate national sovereignty and has
been challenging the patrols since December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The zones were set up to protect Shiite Muslims in the south and
Kurds in the north from attacks by Iraq's army.

<HEADLINE> Dynasties Vs. Democracy in Japan  </HEADLINE>
By MARI YAMAGUCHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Yuko Obuchi is 26 years old, barely out of college,
and has never been elected to public office. But her father was
prime minister -- and that's why many see her as the perfect
parliamentary candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, where elections are looming, being a politician's son,
daughter, widow or even cousin is often enough to wrap up voter
support.
</P>
<P>
   For Obuchi, who announced her candidacy Tuesday, inheriting
office is something of a family tradition. Her father -- Keizo
Obuchi, who died this month -- was first elected to Parliament at
age 26 to fill a seat left vacant by the death of his father.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm running at the same age as my father,'' she said. ''I feel
I am standing at the same start line.''
</P>
<P>
   Yuko Obuchi worked as an assistant director at a television
station before becoming her father's aide. At a news conference
Tuesday, she did not talk about her campaign platform.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me, my father was an ideal politician, and I want to
emulate him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But with many of Japan's top politicians and nearly one-third of
the lower house of Parliament born into political families,
concerns are being raised over whether this country's still young
democracy is being smothered by ''inheritance politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing has changed since the feudal era,'' said Shigenori
Okazaki, a political analyst at Warburg Dillon Reed. ''Being born
into a political family, or getting into the national bureaucracy,
is one of the only ways to become a politician.''
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon isn't new.
</P>
<P>
   Before World War II, membership in the House of Peers was by
appointment and included adult males of the imperial family, heads
of the hereditary peerage and a few notable scholars and major
taxpayers. That system was eliminated under Japan's postwar
Constitution and replaced by an upper and lower house in which all
members are elected.
</P>
<P>
   With elections for the lower house of parliament to be held June
25, the resurgence of political dynasties has become the focus of
media attention.
</P>
<P>
   The major parties generally refuse to confirm who they will
endorse as candidates until after campaigning officially begins on
June 13. The trend toward dynasty-building is unmistakable,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Some 140 of the lower house's 500 seats are held by descendants
of former lawmakers. In the less powerful 252-member upper house,
the number is 30.
</P>
<P>
   The number of such family-held seats in the lower house has
risen steadily, more than tripling from just 38 in the early 1960s,
and the holders of those seats have often proven to be the most
influential politicians. Four of Japan's seven most recent prime
ministers are second- or third-generation lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Former Justice Minister Seiroku Kajiyama and former Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita have announced they will not run next
month. Instead, the party is likely to endorse Kajiyama's son and
Takeshita's younger brother. In Obuchi's case, supporters are
hoping to capitalize on an expected sympathy vote -- the election
date coincides with her father's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one of Japan's largest newspapers, the liberal-leaning
Asahi, warned voters not to choose candidates based on their family
name.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to decide who to vote for based on who the candidate
is, not what family they are from,'' it said in a commentary.
</P>
<P>
   Some voters are also becoming more wary of the tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ''Inheritance politics has nothing to do with policies,'' said
Satoko Kishi, a Tokyo office worker. ''It's wrong for one family to
monopolize a constituency as if it's their private property.''

<HEADLINE> Smith Corona files for bankruptcy, strikes purchase agreement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CORTLAND, N.Y. (AP) -- Smith Corona, once one of America's
leading typewriter makers, filed for bankruptcy Tuesday and agreed
to sell its assets to Carolina Wholesale Office Machine Co. for
approximately $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   It is the second time in five years that the troubled
97-year-old office supply company has declared bankruptcy. Last
month, Smith Corona was dropped from the Nasdaq stock listings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite tremendous efforts over the past five years, it became
clear that Smith Corona could no longer continue to operate as a
stand-alone business,'' said Martin D. Wilson, Smith Corona's newly
appointed president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Smith Corona filed for bankruptcy in Delaware. It listed
liabilities of $14.4 million and assets totaling $12.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase agreement calls for Carolina, a leading wholesale
distributor of office equipment and supplies, to acquire Smith
Corona's inventory, accounts receivable, intellectual property,
equipment, dies and molds and certain contracts and licenses, said
Rivian Bell, a company spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Carolina would pay cash for the assets at
specified percentages of each category's value. Smith Corona
estimated the proceeds would total about $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is subject to bankruptcy court approval and will
be subject to an overbid process, Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina, based in Charlotte, N.C., plans to organize Smith
Corona as a separate operating entity and focus on its core
typewriter and supplies products, said Larry Huneycutt, Carolina's
president.
</P>
<P>
   Smith Corona -- which traces its roots to the L.C. Smith &AMP; Bros.
Typewriter Co. founded in Syracuse in 1903 -- stopped making
products when it emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in
1997. The firm's subsequent transformation from a manufacturer to
seller has been difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ''The new product sales that would have alleviated our financial
constraints did not materialize. Typewriter and supplies and
accessories sales continue, but at reduced market share,'' Wilson
said. ''The voluntary filing under Chapter 11 offers the best
opportunity to complete an asset sale and maximize creditor
recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, Nasdaq told Smith Corona its shares could no longer
trade on that stock market because the company had slipped below
its financial requirements. It was the second time in four years an
exchange dropped the company's stock. In June 1996, the New York
Stock Exchange delisted the stock after Smith Corona's 1995
bankruptcy reorganization plan proposed making the stock worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Although its annual revenues total about $30 million, Smith
Corona lost nearly $16 million during its last fiscal year. Its
payroll, which topped 1,100 before its first bankruptcy filing in
1995, now totals 43 employees.

<HEADLINE> Former Phillipine president recommends ousting terrorists  </HEADLINE>
By RIK STEVENS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, N.Y. (AP) -- Former Phillipine President Fidel Ramos
on Tuesday said his country's government should take whatever steps
necessary, including force, to end a month-old hostage situation.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos called members of the Muslim Abu Sayyaf organization
terrorists and said the taking of 21 foreign hostages would not
have been tolerated during his term from 1992-1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would wish that the government, the authorities, be allowed
to do what they have to do,'' he said Tuesday after ceremonies for
the Distinguished Graduate Award at the United States Military
Academy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Abu Sayyaf must be considered as a terrorist
organization,'' he said of the group that seized the hostages April
23 from the Malaysian resort island of Sipadan. ''They have been
involved in common crimes of kidnapping for ransom, murder,
homicide, rape and robbery.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They have no ideological or political basis to act the way
they are acting and during my time we treated them as such. They
were terrorists who had to be shot and killed because of the
wrongs, the offenses, the degradations.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramos, Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin and Persian Gulf War
General Frederick M. Franks were honored Tuesday with the
distinguished graduates awards for former cadets who have made a
significant mark in history.
</P>
<P>
   Aldrin graduated third in his West Point class of 1951 then
earned his Air Force pilot's wings and flew Sabre jets in the
Korean War, completing 66 combat missions and earning two
Distinguished Flying Crosses and three air medals.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1963, Aldrin was selected by the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration as one of the program's first astronauts.
On the Gemini 12 flight, he demonstrated man's ability to work
outside a space vehicle and on the Apollo 8 mission improved the
techniques used for astronautical navigation.
</P>
<P>
   Aldrin, 70, is best remembered for his role in the summer of
1969 when he and Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins flew Apollo 11
to the moon. Armstrong was the first man to step foot on the moon
and Aldrin was the second. Even with all the previous accolades,
Aldrin said Tuesday's award was special.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't think of anything that has come my way that is really
more meaningful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos graduated from the academy in 1950 and took the skills he
learned there back to his native Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Serving in the Korean and Vietnam wars, he ascended through the
military hierarchy to become the armed forces' chief of staff.
After helping depose dictator Ferdinand Marcos in 1986, Ramos
served new president Corazon Aquino as defense minister. In 1992,
Aquino nominated Ramos for president and he won by a narrow margin.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos inherited a country beset with problems: Political
instability, mounting casualties from attacks by Moro
secessionists, military rebels and terrorists, a poor economy, a
failing infrastructure and a disillusioned population.
</P>
<P>
   During his six-year term, the economy rebounded. In 1996, he
helped forge a peace agreement with the Moros and military rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Franks graduated from West Point in 1959 and pursued a career in
the Army's armored units. While fighting in Cambodia, he was
severely wounded and lost his left leg below the knee. Rather than
retire or transfer to a non-combat post, Franks fought for, and
won, the right to return to battle.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Franks commanded the VII Corps in Saudi Arabia and in
100 hours of rapid maneuver, helped destroy the Iraqi army in the
Persian Gulf War. Under his leadership, the corps defeated 14 Iraqi
divisions while losing fewer than 100 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of us does anything in life by ourselves and I'm very
grateful for my family, the Association of Graduates, my alma mater
here, my classmates and especially the great soldiers with whom it
was my privilege to serve in the Army for almost 35 and a half
years,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Study gives failing grades to 12 New Jersey counties  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The American Lung Association has given failing
grades to a
dozen New Jersey counties in a study of ozone pollution.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Camden and Ocean counties lead the state in ozone levels,
according to the three-year study. The association concluded that
132.5 million Americans have elevated health risks because of air
pollution and named the greater New York City region, including
northern New Jersey, as one of the top-25, most polluted
metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   Sunlight combines with heat and pollutants from automobiles,
factories and power plants to produce ozone, a pungent gas that
inflames lungs and breathing passages.
</P>
<P>
   The association analyzed U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
reports of ozone levels across the nation between 1996 and 1998,
and monitored the highest daily maximum concentration of ozone over
an eight-hour period.
</P>
<P>
   Using EPA standards, the association counted the number of days
during the three years that posed a health risk to some people,
such as children or people with pre-existing respiratory
conditions. It also tracked days with unhealthy and very unhealthy
ozone levels.
</P>
<P>
   Camden County led the state and was No. 21 in the nation with 71
days with unhealthful ozone levels, including eight days that posed
health risks to all people. Ocean County followed with 62 days.
</P>
<P>
   Other counties receiving failing grades were Atlantic (53 days);
Gloucester (51 days); Hunterdon (47 days); Morris (45 days); Mercer
(44 days); Monmouth (43 days); Middlesex (40 days); Cumberland (37
days); Hudson (20 days) and Essex (14 days).
</P>
<P>
   Bergen County received a D for eight unhealthful ozone days,
which state officials attributed to a phenomenon in urban areas in
which air pollutants interfere with the creation of ozone.
</P>
<P>
   The association said data from Passaic and Union counties were
incomplete. Association spokesman D'Von Pryor said he did not know
why the association did not include data from New Jersey's six
other counties.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles, Riverside and Orange County, Calif., area led
the nation as the most polluted county, with nearly half of its
15.3-million population at risk for developing respiratory ailments
because of ozone. Ozone levels also violated federal standards in
Houston, Phoenix, Denver and Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The association recommended tougher pollution standards for
electric power plants and heavy industry and greater investment in
public transportation to help reduce ozone levels.

<HEADLINE> 'Capture the Moment' -- a feast of Pulitzer Prize-winning photos  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- They're history, but these photographs still
give you goose bumps.
</P>
<P>
   There's the shot of an emaciated Sudanese girl, in near-fetal
position on a parched field. Just feet away sits a beady-eyed
vulture, eager for carrion.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the Norman Rockwell-style photo of President
Clinton, peering over a soda fountain into the happy-go-lucky face
of a boy in a baseball cap.
</P>
<P>
   They're part of the biggest ever exhibit of Pulitzer
Prize-winning photographs, ''Capture the Moment,'' which opened
Monday at the Newseum on Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Such shots are no fluke, insists J. Ross Baughman, who won the
prize in 1978 for his image of the Rhodesian civil war -- a soldier
of the white-led government holding a pistol flush to the head of a
black man prostrate in a lineup. The photographer was forced to
leave the country, smuggling out the film.
</P>
<P>
   ''They say you have to be at the right spot at the right time,''
says Baughman, now photo editor for The Washington Times. ''But
before you pick up a camera, for weeks, for months, you're going to
see what you have to tell the world. In this case, people caught in
the 'verb' of racism.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then you hold up your hand and say, 'This is significant.'''
</P>
<P>
   The more than 100 images on display record split seconds that
will forever touch viewers' souls.
</P>
<P>
   It's not an easy job.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Carter, the South African photographer who captured the
starving child, committed suicide two months after accepting the
Pulitzer in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He had taken the photo after hearing a high-pitched whimpering --
the voice of the tiny girl. He clicked his Nikon shutter, he said,
then sat under a tree, lit a cigarette, talked to God and cried.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really, really sorry I didn't pick up the child,'' he said
after his photo was published in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The collection begins with the Pulitzer for 1942, the first year
a photograph was eligible for the most prestigious award in
journalism, and extends to last year's images of Kosovo refugees
and the shooting at Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   War and conflict are dominant themes in the exhibit, from World
War II, Korea and Vietnam to America on the verge of nuclear war
with the Soviet Union over Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most indelible moments is Associated Press
photographer Paul Vathis' ''Two Men With a Problem,'' showing only
the backs of President Kennedy and former President Eisenhower as
they walk up a path at Camp David, conferring on the Bay of Pigs.
</P>
<P>
   Vathis remembers: ''I heard Ike say, 'I know a place where we
can talk.'''
</P>
<P>
   By then, photographers had been told to stop shooting. But
Vathis, crouching next to his Hasselblad on the ground, looked up
and saw the perfect picture -- ''the two men, looking so lonely
among the trees.''
</P>
<P>
   He knew the Secret Service agent blocking the view, a man
nicknamed Moose. Vathis begged him, ''Moose, open up your legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Click, click. His lens opened only twice.
</P>
<P>
   One shot of two powerful backs won the 1962 Pulitzer.
</P>
<P>
   But it was an excruciatingly expressive face that captured the
1990 feature photography Pulitzer, amid the anti-communist
revolution in Romania that toppled the blood-bathed dictatorship of
Nicolae Ceausescu.
</P>
<P>
   Prize-winner David Turnley, working for the Detroit Free Press,
was there with his twin brother, Peter Turnley, who worked for
Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   They both photographed the same man in a crowd cheering the
arrival of a busload of Western doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ''You see in his face more than euphoria,'' David Turnley said
of his subject. ''It's also catharsis -- and venom toward
Ceausescu.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, that man kept returning to the hotel where the
brothers had stayed. And finally, in 1992, Peter Turnley visited
again, his brother says, ''and the receptionist told him, 'You HAVE
to meet this man. He wants to tell you how he felt in that
moment.'''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit remains in New York through Sept. 23, then travels
to the Arlington, Va., headquarters of the Newseum, an interactive
gallery that shows visitors how news is made. It is sponsored by
the Freedom Forum, a nonpartisan foundation that promotes a free
press and free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Starting today, an AP-sponsored show of photographs called
''Eyes on Africa'' opens in Brooklyn. Its more than 350 images
celebrate photojournalists and videojournalists who worked, often
anonymously and in danger, to capture Africa in war and peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eyes on Africa'' runs through July 15 at the Five Myles
gallery, named after Myles Tierney, an AP television producer
killed by rebel gunmen in Sierra Leone last year.

   LONDON (AP) -- Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher is taking his act
off the road.
</P>
<P>
   He won't appear in foreign dates on the band's world tour,
although he will return for shows in Britain this summer, their

</P>
<P>
   A replacement guitarist has already been found -- Matt Deighton,
who has played with Paul Weller and Mother Earth.

<P>
   Gallagher's temporary departure is the latest in a long line of
rifts within the band and leaves his brother, lead singer Liam, as
the only remaining member of the original lineup.
</P>

we'll hit the ground running'' with Deighton on board. He had no

<HEADLINE> Marsalis Plans First Jazz Hall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Wynton Marsalis touted plans Tuesday for the
world's first concert halls built especially for jazz, in a
100,000-square-foot complex with a view of Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything is going to be integrated: the relationship between
one space and another, the relationship between the audience and
the musicians will be one fluid motion because that's how our music
is,'' Marsalis said of the $103 million jazz center to be built at
Columbus Circle. Marsalis will be artistic director.
</P>
<P>
   The new complex is scheduled to open in 2003. It will include a
1,100-seat theater and a 600-seat performance atrium with a dance
floor and tables. Musicians will perform in front of a 50-foot
window overlooking the park from six floors up.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a 140-seat jazz cafe is planned, along with a jazz
Hall of Fame, two rehearsal studios and a classroom.
</P>
<P>
   The complex, on the site of the New York Coliseum now being
razed, also is to house the headquarters of AOL-Time Warner,
stores, condominiums, a garage and a hotel.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 102; Dow Down 76  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks widened their losses this afternoon as
investors continued shedding technology names. Interest rate
worries once again prevented investors from mustering much
enthusiasm for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the risks are on the table now,'' said Richard E. Cripps,
chief market strategist at Legg Mason in Baltimore. ''We have
rising interest rates, an effort to slow the economy and high
valuations. Other than than lower stock prices, there's nothing to
bring investors back.''
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the
Nasdaq composite index was down 102.44 at 3,261.77, on track to
close below its previous low for the year -- 3,321.29 on April 14,
when the index plummeted 355 points in a single session.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 76.42 at 10,466.13,
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 15.06 at 1,385.66.
</P>
<P>
   Still, more stocks were rising than falling on the New York
Stock Exchange, indicating that investors remain interested in
putting money to work.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, however, investors demonstrated little
conviction and barely any interest in bargain-hunting. On Monday,
both the Dow and the Nasdaq fell more than 200 points at midday
before clawing back to more modest losses.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors salvaged Monday's market by buying
stocks that had been knocked down to bargain prices. The market's
failure to rally today indicates true malaise, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pressure to sell increases as the market goes lower,''
Cripps said. ''Traders recognize that and are unwilling to step in
front of the market and start buying.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading technology companies continued their long, steady slide.
Cisco Systems fell 2\ to 53, Intel fell 5| to 112} and Oracle fell

   Investors are dumping high-priced technology stocks that appear
overvalued in an environment of rising interest rates. While
investors earlier this year convinced themselves that the rapid
growth rates of technology companies would enable them to outrun
rising rates, many now believe that even fast growth won't be
enough to justify their still-high prices.

   Wall Street analysts are anticipating quiet trading at least

<HEADLINE> Kenya Rations Power  </HEADLINE>
By CHEGE MBITIRU
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- With scant rain drying up lakes that power
hydroelectric dams, Kenya announced stringent power-rationing
Tuesday with 12-hour cuts, six days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers say existing rationing already is destroying the
shrinking industrial base in this East African nation of 29 million
and that further reductions will only make thing worse.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Monday, all domestic users will experience power cuts
from 6:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., manufacturers from 6:30 p.m. to 6:30
a.m., Energy Minister Francis Masakhalia said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Arrangements have been made to ensure that essential services
are not interrupted,'' Masakhalia told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   He said police patrols will be substantially increased in
industrial areas to ensure security during the shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The Kenya Power and Lighting Co., a partially government-owned
monopoly that distributes power generated by the recently split-off
Kenya Electricity Generating Co., introduced six-hour, three days a
week, power cuts in September.
</P>
<P>
   The rationing will not apply in the central business district of
the capital, Nairobi, where most government offices are also
located.
</P>
<P>
   Critics accuse the Ministry of Energy of failing to act on
warnings last November that a failure of the April-May rains would
hurt the hydroelectric plants that produce most of Kenya's
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The national daily power output has dropped from 580 megawatts
to 480 megawatts. New York, in comparison, uses more than 30,000
megawatts at peak summer demand.
</P>
<P>
   Masakhalia said the government is negotiating to buy 30
megawatts from neighboring Uganda and considering renting a diesel
power plant and repairing a retired 30 megawatt diesel plant at the
Indian Ocean port of Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
   Renting a plant needed to meet the current average 180 megawatt
shortfall at peak hours will cost $10 million a month and consume
diesel worth $20 million, a cost that would have to be passed on to
consumers, the energy minister said.
</P>
<P>
   Masakhalia said construction is under way on at least six
geothermal and thermal plants to reduce dependency on
hydroelectricity, but none of the plants will be operational before
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Although rainfall is expected to increase slightly between May
and August, it will not improve water levels in dams until
September, when the yearly short rains begin.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Trial Adjourns  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP) -- The Lockerbie trial was adjourned
moments after it reconvened Tuesday when new stenographic equipment
in the $18 million, state-of-the-art courtroom malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
   The presiding Scottish judge, Lord Ranald Sutherland, was
clearly piqued by the problem, which caused the latest of many
delays in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial.
</P>
<P>
   Computer screens around the courtroom are supposed to provide a
real-time transcript of the proceedings. But Sutherland said
recently installed high-tech equipment ''appears to have disrupted
what was a perfectly working system.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge adjourned the case until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Since the two Libyan defendants were extradited on April 5,
1999, Sutherland has grudgingly granted repeated delays requested
by both the prosecution and defense.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Fhimah began May 3 at a Scottish courthouse constructed at Camp
Zeist, a former U.S. air base, at a cost of $18 million to British
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged Libyan intelligence agents are accused of planting a
bomb in the New York-bound airliner, which exploded Dec. 21, 1988,
over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people, including 189
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Megrahi and Fhimah are charged with murder, conspiracy to
murder and endangering aircraft safety. They face a maximum
sentence of life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants have blamed Palestinian factions based in Syria
for the attack. The trial is expected to last up to a year.

<HEADLINE> Tide Swings for China Trade Bill  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supporters of a Clinton administration-backed
bill to grant permanent normal trade benefits to China appeared
headed toward a close victory despite an aggressive final onslaught
from organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders scheduled debate on the bill to begin later
Tuesday, moving up the start of debate by a full day. A final vote
was expected Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents weighed rallying behind an effort to tie the trade
benefits to Taiwan's security as a last-ditch effort to sidetrack
the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But vote counters on both sides said that supporters had drawn
within range of the needed 218 votes to pass the bill -- and might
already be there.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expect to pass that bill,'' House Majority Leader Richard
Armey, R-Texas, told reporters as more and more of a dwindling pool
of undecideds came out in favor of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders are expected to produce about 150 of those
votes, while Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., the chief Democratic
supporter, said he believes he can meet his target of 70-80
Democratic votes.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who has made the bill a top legislative
priority of his final year, reminded lawmakers at the White House
on Tuesday to consider future generations before voting.
</P>
<P>
   ''The consequences of this vote will be felt after I am no
longer president,'' Clinton said. ''Our country fought three wars
in Asia in the last half-century. We ought to give our children a
chance to have a different 50 years ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would extend permanent normal trade privileges to
China, guaranteeing China the same low-tariff access to U.S.
markets that nearly every other country in the world has. For the
past 20 years, China has received this preferential treatment -- but
it has had to be renewed annually.
</P>
<P>
   The new status is part of China's admission to the World Trade
Organization, the Geneva-based body that sets rules for world
trade.
</P>
<P>
   In return, China agreed to lower barriers to U.S. products and
investment.
</P>
<P>
   On a day in which both sides engaged in furious lobbying, even
Texas Gov. George W. Bush came to Capitol Hill to try to win more
converts among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to encourage members to vote for it. I think the
president has given it his best shot, and I was happy to see the
vice president finally emerge and make a statement,'' the
prospective GOP presidential candidate said.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, Gore gave his strongest endorsement yet of the
legislation in a speech to a union group.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of labor unions prowled the halls of Congress
seeking last-minute converts.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to keep debate on the bill from becoming a
free-for-all, Republican leaders managed to deflect further
attempts to amend the China trade package, setting it up for a
straight up-and-down vote on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The House Rules Committee, which sets ground rules for debate,
did incorporate into the package two amendments agreed to earlier
by sponsors. One would set up a watchdog commission to monitor
human rights in China. The other would help protect U.S. industries
against surges in imports from China.
</P>
<P>
   However, opponents will get one shot at modifying the measure
before the final vote is taken -- a motion to ''recommit'' it to the
House Ways and Means Committee. By a majority vote, the House could
''instruct'' the committee to modify the legislation
</P>
<P>
   Opponents were considering supporting a proposal by Rep. Howard
L. Berman, D-Calif., that would automatically end trade privileges
to China if Beijing attacked or set up a naval blockade of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no issue more volatile for the Chinese than this
issue of Taiwan,'' Berman said. He predicted that if his proposal
ever got put to a vote in the House, where support for Taiwan is
high, ''it would get 400 votes.''
</P>
<P>
   However, leaders sought ways to avoid such a vote from
happening.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Barak Being Second Guessed  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- For a man famous for precise and methodical
planning, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak finds himself presiding
over an unholy mess in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   And as the chaos deepens, his critics are having a field day.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two days, Israelis have been transfixed by a
parade of indelible images: Hezbollah guerrillas planting their
flags almost on Israel's border, Israel's militia allies breaking
ranks to flee in terror, young Israeli soldiers kissing the ground
in relief at making it out of Lebanon alive.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, as Barak told the public that Israel's pullout from
Lebanon could be completed within 10 days, news reports on the
withdrawal hammered on the twin themes of ineptitude and
humiliation. One commentary in the Maariv newspaper likened
Israel's last days in Lebanon to the fall of Saigon, invoking
scenes of helicopters lifting off from the besieged U.S. Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said Israeli military tacticians had inexplicably failed
to anticipate Hezbollah guerrillas' use of Lebanese civilians as a
human wedge to overrun much of the Israeli-occupied zone, and that
Barak had committed himself to the troop pullout out of
overconfidence that he could first reach a peace deal with Syria,
the main power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's response, in a series of interviews Tuesday, was
characteristically phlegmatic. Yes, the former general said in
effect, it's a mess all right -- but not one of his making.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cut off a tragedy that lasted 18 years,'' he told army
radio, referring to Israel's presence in south Lebanon since a 1982
invasion that took Israeli troops deeper into the neighboring
country. ''We are ending a vicious cycle that prevented withdrawal
until now. ... Every time Hezbollah had the upper hand, we would
say we would not leave under pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Barak put a finger on one of the most sensitive
aspects of the pullout: In Israel, where military service is nearly
universal and army culture pervades much of daily life, the notion
of retreating under fire runs counter to a closely held battlefield
ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very sad day,'' lawmaker Amnon Rubenstein said. ''It
sets a very bad example, as if Israel can be driven out.''
</P>
<P>
   While the departure from Lebanon might look like a rout, the
prime minister and his partisans insisted it was the only way to
extricate Israel from a quagmire. Top officials depicted the buffer
zone in south Lebanon as a burden Israel was only too happy to
shake off.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hezbollah will make it out to be a big victory, but we know
the truth,'' said Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, who called
Israel's presence in the zone a ''long march of folly.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the criticism aimed at Barak was familiar, and from
expected quarters. Hawkish opposition leader Ariel Sharon, the
architect of the 1982 invasion, said Israeli forces should not
leave without first subduing any challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's wrong to carry out a unilateral withdrawal without
imposing quiet on south Lebanon first,'' he told Israel radio.
''The prime minister is not standing up to pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Such complaints found a ready audience in Israel's north, where
many people feel their safety is being trifled with.
</P>
<P>
   ''This whole city should be evacuated and turned into an army
base,'' said an irate Ilana Aderi, 58, emerging from a night in the
bomb shelters in the northern town of Kiryat Shemona. ''No one
should live here.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak and top aides counter by saying that the pullout actually
leaves Israel safer, because they have put Lebanon and Syria on
notice that any attack now will carry far harsher reprisals than
Israel wanted to risk while it had troops in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   A criticism likelier to stick was the Barak camp's apparent
failure to foresee the collapse of the Israeli-allied South Lebanon
Army -- particularly that of a predominantly Shiite Muslim brigade
manning key positions in the heart of the Israeli-occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who was the strategic genius that decided to begin the
withdrawal from the most problematic of sectors -- the central,
Shiite sector?'' commentator Alex Fishman demanded sarcastically in
the Yediot Ahronot daily.
</P>
<P>
   Debate was also growing inside and outside Israel over a new
danger: Hezbollah's unchecked presence on Israel's very doorstep.
Because the guerrillas have already seized control of much of the
border zone, a hoped-for U.N. deployment all the way down to
Israel's frontier now appears less likely.
</P>
<P>
   ''You want us to be a punching bag in the middle, everybody
taking potshots at us -- and everyone would then blame the U.N. for
everything that we are not responsible for?'' U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan asked at one point Monday, as the
Security Council was discussing deployment plans.

<HEADLINE> State goes to national group of experts to aid Camden  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- He was Cincinnati's city manager during a
fiscal crisis, credited with guiding an economic rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Now he'll be counselor to Camden, as state officials on Tuesday
turned to the National Academy of Public Administrators to help
manage New Jersey's poorest city.
</P>
<P>
   Division of Community Affairs Commissioner Jane M. Kenny said
she sought out the Washington, D.C., organization after the state
assumed complete control of finances in Camden, where state tax
money funds 70 cents of every dollar in the city's $112 million
budget.
</P>
<P>
   The academy then agreed to dispatch Sylvester Murray to be the
lead adviser to the team of state officials managing daily
operations, Kenny said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were looking for broad and creative approaches to solve the
problems we face in Camden,'' Kenny said. ''We felt that this
person would aid our ability to see what's working and what
wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray will work with the state management team in place since
May 12, Kenny said.
</P>
<P>
   A vote two days earlier by the state Local Finance Board gave
state officials the ability to approve all city spending, contracts
and collective bargaining agreements. State supervisors can limit
debt, authorize any refinancing and hire and fire non-Civil Service
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Cincinnati during his term, the national and state
economies are not in trouble, Murray said. Cincinnati had to cope
with its own problems as well as external troubles he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Camden is not succeeding in a state that is succeeding,''
Murray said, noting Camden County and New Jersey as a whole enjoy
record economic gains.
</P>
<P>
   Now a director at Cleveland State University's urban public
management program, Murray was city manager in San Diego and Ann
Arbor, Mich., as well as Cincinnati from 1979 to 1985. Murray
helped direct redevelopment of that city's downtown and riverfront
districts, Kenny said.
</P>
<P>
   Murray is an elected fellow, one of about 500 public policy,
administration professionals and academics with the national
academy, said Robert J. O'Neill, Jr., the group's president. The
nonprofit group was founded in 1967 and given a congressional
charter in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill said the organization acts much like the National
Academy of Sciences, with its pool of available members with
specialized interests.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got a problem, you bring in the experts,'' O'Neill
said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials contend that Camden Mayor Milton Milan's
administration repeatedly ignored warnings to correct faulty
financial practices. The city does not keep proper records,
including a general ledger and an account of city payouts, all of
which are required by law, the state says.
</P>
<P>
   The finance board on April 14 voted to place the city under
supervision, prompting the state attorney general's office to file
a lawsuit asking a judge to approve the control measures.
</P>
<P>
   That vote came after Milan failed to meet a two-week deadline to
correct the long-standing problems.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimatum came a day after Milan was named in an indictment
charging him with extortion, money laundering and mail fraud.
Authorities say Milan accepted payoffs and gifts from city
contractors and took bribes from organized crime figures.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Milan threatened to file bankruptcy before he
accepted a deal to allow a state financial review board some
oversight of city operations. But despite that monitoring, the
state alleges, Camden officials continued to ignore the problems.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, the state says Camden filed annual audits more
than two years after they were due. When the audits were filed,
some contained a notice from the auditor that the examinations
could not be done because Camden kept no records of its
expenditures. And in 1998, Camden overspent its budget by nearly
$500,000, according to the state's legal brief.

<HEADLINE> G-Rates Films Viloent: Study Says  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Many G-rated animated films -- from ''Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfs'' and ''Pinocchio'' through ''Toy
Story'' and ''The Rugrats Movie'' -- contain a surprising amount of
violence, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   In a study published in Wednesday's Journal of the American
Medical Association, two researchers cited scenes of fisticuffs,
sword-fighting, gunplay and other aggressive action.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood is often criticized for violence in movies for adults,
but parents should be aware of what is in G-rated movies, the
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey examined 74 G-rated theatrical films available on
video and found that each contained at least one act of violence.
At least one character was injured in 46 of the movies, and at
least one was killed in half of the films.
</P>
<P>
   The movies averaged 9.5 minutes of violence, with the 1998 King
Arthur tale ''Quest for Camelot'' topping the list with 24 minutes
of violence, or almost 30 percent of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said they believe their study included every
G-rated theatrical feature available on video before last
September.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were surprised that every single one of them had some act
of violence,'' said Kimberly Thompson, assistant professor of risk
analysis at the Harvard School of Public Health. ''We're just
raising the red flag. It's important for parents to be aware of the
violence content in these movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Much cartoon violence is slapstick intended for comic effect,
whose influence on children's behavior is uncertain, said Fumie
Yokota, a Harvard doctoral student in health policy who co-wrote
the study.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may desensitize kids so much, they think it's OK and no big
deal for somebody to be smacked in the head with a hammer,'' Yokota
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the movies may send the message that force is an
acceptable way to resolve differences, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cartoon violence is one of the most likely forms to promote
imitation,'' said Joanne Cantor, a communications professor
emeritus at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who has researched
media influence on children. ''It normalizes violence and also
trivializes violence in a way by focusing not on negative
consequences of violence but making it funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson and Yokota recommended that the Motion Picture
Association of America consider changing its rating system to
include more detail on the content of G-rated films.
</P>
<P>
   MPAA chief Jack Valenti said in a statement that the ratings
system in place since the late 1960s consistently receives ''high
approval marks'' from parents.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also advised parents to screen G-rated movies
beforehand or watch them with their children so they can discuss
the violent content. They noted that Web sites such as Kids-in-Mind
and Screenit provide details about violence, sex and other content
for many movies.

<P>
   Putin last week eliminated the State Committee for Environmental
Protection, which was responsible for monitoring all aspects of the
environment except nuclear safety.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental protection was placed under the Ministry on
Natural Resources, which helps enterprises make the most of
Russia's mining, oil and timber resources.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ministry for natural resources is not interested in
defending the environment,'' said Yevgeny Usov, a spokesman for
Greenpeace's Russian chapter.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were created specifically to exploit natural resources
such as oil and minerals, water resources -- they aren't interested
in ecological affairs,'' he charged.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was part of an apparent cost-cutting move to trim
Russia's unwieldy number of ministries and committees. Ecologists
said it suggests Putin, elected president in March, has decided to
put economic growth ahead of looming environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''This decree is a call to action for all who want to exploit
nature,'' the committee's former head Viktor Danilov-Danilyan said
at a news conference Tuesday, according to RTR television.
</P>
<P>
   Vast and unique nature areas across Russia are threatened,
ecologists say.
</P>
<P>
   Feeble oversight has allowed a company to start mining gold in a
national park in Russia's Arctic, Russian NTV television reported
Tuesday. A dam is planned in a nature reserve in the Ural
Mountains, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental problems in Russia include oil spills,
contaminated drinking water, over-logging and huge, poorly stashed
repositories of nuclear and chemical waste, much left over from the
Cold War military buildup.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first time Putin has angered environmentalists. As
head of the country's FSB security service, he accused ecological
groups of providing cover for foreign spies.
</P>
<P>
   A sister agency in charge of nuclear oversight, The State Atomic
Supervisory committee, was stripped of much of its power last
summer while the Atomic Energy Ministry took over some of its
functions.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- When an ice storm struck northern New York
two years ago, some stores spared direct damage from the fierce
weather still lost money when government agencies shut down nearby
roads.
</P>
<P>
   Now Gov. George Pataki has proposed a ''civil authority''
insurance bill to allow insurers to sell business policies covering
such losses.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an important change that must be made to protect
businesses from situations that are beyond their control and which
could substantially hurt their operations,'' Pataki said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   As is, so-called ''businesses interruption'' insurance says a
business has to be physically damaged before a merchant can collect
money.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether any insurer would accept Pataki's
offer and provide this type of coverage. While the industry group
New York Insurance Association supports the bill, spokesman Bernie
Bordeau said Tuesday insurers who offer that coverage would be
engaging in ''risky business.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Unlike the whims of nature ... you're now adding the whims of
a political entity,'' he said. Bordeau said his group was pleased,
however, that insurers would not be required to offer the coverage,
but would merely be allowed to. ''We like the fact that the
administration is giving new opportunities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Business Council of New York State, and the owner of an
Albany Tastee Freeze that lost about half its business after
torrential rains last week washed out the road it sits on, were
quick to endorse the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''We love it,'' said Business Council spokesman Matthew Maguire.
''It puts a business in a position where it can protect itself a
little bit more thoroughly for the effects of events that are
harmful but only indirectly.''
</P>
<P>
   Tastee Freeze owner Jim Sheldon said he is now working with his
insurer on the possibility he might be covered but is facing an
obstacle since his business was not damaged. The neighboring suburb
of Bethlehem, where most of his customers live, was cut off by the
road closing.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an issue that needs to be addressed,'' Sheldon said.
''If (Pataki) wants to use me as a test case, send 'im on down. The
lieutenant governor had a cone here yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's bill was in the Rules committee, which is controlled by
Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, in the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said his proposal ''will help New York State business,
especially small businesses, stay in business during trying
times.''
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly's Democratic leadership did not immediately return
a call for comment on the bill.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Off 200; Dow Down 120  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index fell nearly 200
points today, sinking to its lowest close since last November and
erasing nearly all its spectacular gains. It fell as investors once
again dumped technology names. Worries over rising interest rates
once again prevented buyers from stepping in to stem the decline.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the risks are on the table now,'' said Richard E. Cripps,
chief market strategist at Legg Mason in Baltimore. ''We have
rising interest rates, an effort to slow the economy and high
valuations. Other than than lower stock prices, there's nothing to
bring investors back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq fell 199.52 to 3,164.29. The Nasdaq hadn't closed
that low since Nov. 10, 1999, when the index was in the earliest
stages of its dramatic ascent. With today's losses, the Nasdaq is a
stunning 37 percent below its March 10 closing record of 5,048.62.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the weakness in technology stocks undermined the
broader market. The Dow Jones industrial average, which flirted
with positive territory at several points, finished down 120.28 at
10,422.27.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower.
</P>
<P>
   Traders endured another session of relatively low volume, which
highlighted the utter absence of willing buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one wants to step forward and buy anything,'' said Larry
Lawler, manager of equity trading at Dreyfus Corp. in New York.
''There's great fear out there, and the sellers are just more
aggressive than the buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, technology stocks led the decline, continuing a
long, steady slide. Cisco Systems, Intel and Oracle were all lower.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks were mostly lower, too. Amazon.com and eBay
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are dumping high-priced technology stocks that appear
overvalued in an environment of rising interest rates. While
investors earlier this year convinced themselves that the rapid
growth rates of technology companies would enable them to outrun
rising rates, many now believe that even fast growth won't be
enough to justify their still-high prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like it or not, inflation is not going to help the growth
areas of the market,'' Lawler said.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered buying interest was concentrated in the blue-chip
stocks that dominate the Dow. Boeing rose.
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell, a Dow component, rose. PaineWebber analyst David
Bleustein launched coverage on the stock with a ''buy'' rating.
Bleustein applauded Honeywell's efforts to capitalize on the
technological innovations that are driving the so-called new
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts are anticipating quiet trading at least
until Thursday, when the next wave of economic data hits the
market. The Commerce Department will issue its preliminary report
on first-quarter gross domestic product, and the National
Association of Realtors will report on existing home sales for
April.
</P>
<P>
   Both reports could offer some indication of whether the Federal
Reserve's six interest rate increases in the past 11 months are
successfully slowing the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said moderate figures could calm the distressed market.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we are now needing is a change in psychology,'' Cripps
said. ''Either economic statistics showing slower growth, or a
decline to the point that investors can gain conviction that it
can't go much lower.''

<HEADLINE> US Disaster Risk Rises With Growth  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Natural disasters are getting more frequent
and more severe, Federal Emergency Management Agency Director James
Lee Witt said Tuesday, preaching a gospel of preparation and
prevention for Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tornado activity, we see now, normally starts in the spring of
the year, starting in January. Hurricane seasons seem like they're
much more intense,'' Witt told editors and reporters of The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will see,'' he said, from ''what the scientists tell us,
some extremely devastating events in the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a proposed budget of $300 million for a disaster
fund, Witt said his agency studied its disaster costs over the
previous five years and found the average was $2.9 billion
annually. That's now the size of FEMA's disaster contingency fund.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to change the landscape of America ... to make
our communities more disaster resistant,'' said Witt, who recalled
being in his family home at age six when a tornado moved the
building off its foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Some communities have passed ordinances blocking development in
wetlands and other dangerous areas, he said, but ''we have a long
way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Expanded construction of homes and businesses to accommodate a
growing population often impedes natural protections against
flooding -- paving over open spaces and cutting down forests.
</P>
<P>
   Witt cited Project Impact and FEMA's buyout and relocation
programs as major efforts in preventing future losses in disasters.
</P>
<P>
   The buyout and relocation program launched in 1993 moves people
away from dangerous areas, especially flood plains, and turns that
land into parks that cannot be built on in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Project Impact, just two years old, has become active in both
hurricane- and tornado-prone areas, providing builders and
homeowners with plans and assistance in making homes and buildings
more resistant to disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Coastal residents are encouraged to raise their homes up on
stilts so storm surge waters can pass beneath them, while concrete
or steel safe rooms can be added to homes facing severe winds.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200 communities are participating in Project Impact, he
said, developing their own plans and running their own projects.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA provides $300,000 in seed money to each community and helps
them organize public-private partnerships, with businesses
contributing about $4.50 for every federal dollar involved, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   One developer in Tulsa, Okla., he recalled, offered tornado-safe
rooms as part of new homes, and nine of the first ten buyers opted
to pay the extra $2,500 for the room -- which can also be used as a
closet, bathroom or vault when not needed for safety. The tenth
couple, he said, were 75 years old and opted for a hot tub instead.
</P>
<P>
   While the safe rooms are difficult to add to mobile homes, he
said, communities are being encouraged to put shelters in schools
or build community safe rooms in mobile home parks.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that the eye of a tornado is much smaller
than the damage path and homes strengthened to resist wind that are
on the fringes of the tornado path will survive.
</P>
<P>
   Witt also said:
</P>
<P>
   --He will leave a memo to the next administration urging that his
agency be kept at its informal current Cabinet-level status or even
be made an official part of the Cabinet to improve coordination
with other parts of the government.
</P>
<P>
   --FEMA has worked with the Transportation Department and
governors of Southeastern states on ways to avoid a traffic
gridlock like the one last year when 2 million residents of several
states tried to evacuate at the same time as Hurricane Floyd
approached.
</P>
<P>
   --The agency is urging communities to obtain insurance for
municipal buildings.
</P>
<P>
   --Of all disasters, the nation is still least prepared for
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   --The National Weather Service has done a good job in increasing
tornado warning times. There was a 37-minute warning in last year's
Oklahoma City tornadoes, he said, ''which helped a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   --Every state must have and enforce a statewide building code to
strengthen homes for wind and other hazards.
</P>
<P>
   --FEMA encountered no hostility from residents of Los Alamos,
N.M., after fires started by the National Park Service damaged many
homes. He praised Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt for moving
quickly to take responsibility for the fire.
</P>
<P>
   He said his agency plans to set up about 300 prefab homes for
people displaced by that fire, and expects these homes will be
needed for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   Witt said he can identify with the residents of Los Alamos,
recalling that his family home burned down when he was 13.
</P>
<P>
   ''You lose so much, whether it's a fire or earthquake ... you
lose so many mementoes, you lose so much of your family history. It
never can be replaced. That's why I'm so focused on the prevention,
because I know we can save lives and we can save property if we do
it right,'' he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Study: G-Rates Films Violent  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Many G-rated animated films -- from ''Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfs'' and ''Pinocchio'' through ''Toy
Story'' and ''The Rugrats Movie'' -- contain a surprising amount of
violence, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   In a study published in Wednesday's Journal of the American
Medical Association, two researchers cited scenes of fisticuffs,
sword-fighting, gunplay and other aggressive action.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood is often criticized for violence in movies for adults,
but parents should be aware of what is in G-rated movies, the
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey examined 74 G-rated theatrical films available on
video and found that each contained at least one act of violence.
At least one character was injured in 46 of the movies, and at
least one was killed in half of the films.
</P>
<P>
   The movies averaged 9.5 minutes of violence, with the 1998 King
Arthur tale ''Quest for Camelot'' topping the list with 24 minutes
of violence, or almost 30 percent of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said they believe their study included every
G-rated theatrical feature available on video before last
September.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were surprised that every single one of them had some act
of violence,'' said Kimberly Thompson, assistant professor of risk
analysis at the Harvard School of Public Health. ''We're just
raising the red flag. It's important for parents to be aware of the
violence content in these movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Much cartoon violence is slapstick intended for comic effect,
whose influence on children's behavior is uncertain, said Fumie
Yokota, a Harvard doctoral student in health policy who co-wrote
the study.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may desensitize kids so much, they think it's OK and no big
deal for somebody to be smacked in the head with a hammer,'' Yokota
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the movies may send the message that force is an
acceptable way to resolve differences, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cartoon violence is one of the most likely forms to promote
imitation,'' said Joanne Cantor, a communications professor
emeritus at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who has researched
media influence on children. ''It normalizes violence and also
trivializes violence in a way by focusing not on negative
consequences of violence but making it funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson and Yokota recommended that the Motion Picture
Association of America consider changing its rating system to
include more detail on the content of G-rated films.
</P>
<P>
   MPAA chief Jack Valenti said in a statement that the ratings
system in place since the late 1960s consistently receives ''high
approval marks'' from parents.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also advised parents to screen G-rated movies
beforehand or watch them with their children so they can discuss
the violent content. They noted that Web sites such as Kids-in-Mind
and Screenit provide details about violence, sex and other content
for many movies.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Claims Victory at Front  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- Thousands of Ethiopian troops on
Tuesday charged Eritrea's most heavily fortified position, a
strategic area held by Eritrea since the outset of the 2-year-old
Horn of Africa war.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin claimed ''glorious
victories'' near Zalambessa in what both sides said was a day of
heavy fighting. He quoted Prime Minister Meles Zenawi as saying the
war could now be over in days.
</P>
<P>
   The widely feared showdown along the central front threatened to
become the bloodiest battle of the war.
</P>
<P>
   In Eritrea, President Isaias Afewerki was defiant, making his
first extended public comments since Ethiopian forces began
fighting again May 12. A senior government official insisted
Eritrean forces were holding their ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are facing difficult circumstances and they could worsen,''
Afewerki told 15,000 Eritreans gathered in the capital, Asmara, to
mark the ninth anniversary of Eritrean independence from Ethiopia.
''But Eritrea will win.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopian forces opened an all-out drive into Eritrea 11 days
ago to try to force an end to a border war that has cost the two
impoverished countries' hundreds of millions of dollars and tens of
thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
   Seyoum told The Associated Press that Zalambessa was the key to
Ethiopia's aim of achieving a rapid victory.
</P>
<P>
   The town of Zalambessa is located on a dry plain in front of
steep, forbidding mountains 100 miles southeast of Asmara. Eritrean
forces seized the area when the conflict began in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, occupying troops have dug long, winding trenches in
the plain and bunkers in the hillsides, surrounded by mines and
supported by heavy artillery -- making any attack by Ethiopia highly
dangerous and costly.
</P>
<P>
   Seyoum said Ethiopian forces had flanked the trenches or found
gaps in them, following the strategy it used to push deep into
western Eritrea earlier in the offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia has said it wants to dismantle the Eritrean army and
recapture territory it says its Horn of Africa neighbor occupies.
</P>
<P>
   If it takes Zalambessa, the most strongly fortified front,
Ethiopia will go a long way to achieving both goals.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that could save Eritrea now is air superiority --
which it does not have, said Andrew Brookes at the London-based
International Institute for Strategic Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries have built large armies -- Ethiopia, 350,000;
Eritrea, 250,000 to 300,000 -- bolstered by Soviet-made warplanes
and other heavy weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people have been surprised how quickly the Ethiopians
have gone, but part of this is simply once you get on a roll that
gives a momentum all of its own,'' Brookes said.
</P>
<P>
   The potentially decisive engagement came as Western and African
envoys conducted a second day of shuttling between the two capitals
to press for a cease-fire and peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Rino Serri, European Union special envoy for the Horn of Africa,
said he was discussing a ''further concrete initiative that may
accelerate ... the peace process'' but would not give details.
</P>
<P>
   Meles, the Ethiopian prime minister, repeatedly has ruled out a
cease-fire before a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   In Asmara, 50 U.N. contractors, spouses and children flew out
Tuesday as a precautionary measure, the U.N. World Food Program
said. They followed more than 200 U.S. Embassy staffers, dependents
and others who evacuated over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The latest offensive has displaced an estimated 550,000
Eritreans, tens of thousands of whom have fled into neighboring
Sudan.

<HEADLINE> Funds Short for South African Homes  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- Six years after it took power
pledging a better life for all, the African National Congress-led
government said Tuesday that 3 million South African families still
lack proper housing.
</P>
<P>
   The government said it doesn't have enough money to build them
and keep pace with growing needs.
</P>
<P>
   When the ANC won all-race elections in 1994, it promised to
address the low-cost housing shortage it inherited from the
apartheid government.
</P>
<P>
   In villages and towns, clusters of tiny brightly colored
government-purchased houses soon sprouted.
</P>
<P>
   More than 4 million people have been housed and over 1 million
housing subsidies have been approved since 1994, Housing Minister
Sankie Mthembi-Mahanyele told Parliament on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, tin shacks stretch as far as the eye can see in the
impoverished township of Kayelitsha on the outskirts of Cape Town --
a common sight in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   There is not enough money to keep pace with the growing
population, the minister acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Mthembi-Mahanyele said the current allocation to the housing
budget is less than 200,000 subsidies a year. He said this is
equivalent to the number of new households being formed each year,
so the limited funds must be divided among them and the estimated 3
million families who still live in makeshift shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The government said it can't afford to increase the one-time
family housing subsidy of 2,100 dollars -- which many people
complain is insufficient to build a solid home -- or make more of
them available.
</P>
<P>
   Mthembi-Mahanyele said the private sector should join efforts to
provide housing.
</P>
<P>
   The housing problem is further complicated by the fact that an
estimated one-third of the working-age population is unemployed and
there is no social safety net for the jobless.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many people who do not consider housing as their immediate
priority acquire a subsidized house which they soon thereafter sell
and move back to informal settlements,'' Mthembi-Mahanyele said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the government has other massive social needs to
tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Water Affairs Minister Ronnie Kasrils told Parliament that more
than 20 million rural people still had no acceptable sanitation and
8 million did not have access to clean water.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Arthur Chaskalson, the president of the Constitutional
Court, recently noted that the government was in danger of flouting
the country's Bill of Rights because so many people still lack
basic services.
</P>
<P>
   The Bill of Rights -- which was part of the Constitution signed
into law in 1996 -- guarantees the right to social security and
adequate food and water, and says the state must take reasonable
legislative and other measures, within available resources, to make
those rights a reality.

<HEADLINE> Government Proposes Research Fines  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal health officials are proposing fines
of up to $250,000 for scientists who violate medical research rules
-- and fines of $1 million for rule-breaking universities or
hospitals -- amid criticism that the government hasn't done enough
to protect thousands of patients involved in clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a clear message that we intend to get serious,''
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said Tuesday,
stressing that the government will hold responsible not just the
scientist at fault but the entire research institution.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists' wallets will be safe for a while -- Shalala still
must ask Congress to pass legislation allowing the Food and Drug
Administration to fine researchers who break the rules.
</P>
<P>
   But Shalala announced additional steps Tuesday that will start
immediately: better training of the local medical boards primarily
responsible for overseeing patient safety, tougher requirements
that patients be fully informed of research risks, and improved
monitoring of how patients fare day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   FDA investigators have recently uncovered serious violations of
basic research rules at some of the nation's most prestigious
universities, including the University of Pennsylvania gene therapy
experiment that killed an Arizona teen-ager last fall.
</P>
<P>
   To check for further problems, the FDA revealed Tuesday that it
had begun unprecedented in-depth inspections of 70 gene therapy
experiments around the country.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue isn't just about gene therapy, it's about all
medical experiments. HHS' inspector general has repeatedly warned
since 1998 that there is little independent monitoring of how
patients fare day-to-day in clinical trials, meaning early warning
signs that an experiment might be too dangerous are missed. The
local medical boards, called ''institutional review boards'' or
IRBs, primarily responsible are overworked and undertrained, the
inspector general said.
</P>
<P>
   Several scientists caught violating research rules have claimed
they were confused about government requirements.
</P>
<P>
   But the nation's top regulators signaled impatience with that
claim.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't accept the confusion defense,'' Shalala said bluntly.
</P>
<P>
   ''These rules have been long-standing,'' added FDA Commissioner
Jane Henney. ''They are pretty fundamental.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some critics have long questioned why the government
hasn't better enforced the rules already. Many of the steps Shalala
announced Tuesday were recommended by her own inspector general in
1998, said Dr. Sidney Wolfe of the consumer advocacy group Public
Citizen.
</P>
<P>
   But Shalala said the biggest change is that the government will
hold accountable not just scientists who violate the rules, but
entire research institutions and IRBs.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton called the steps vital to ensure not just
patient safety but public confidence in the integrity of
cutting-edge science.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are on the brink of discoveries that are astonishing,''
Clinton said. ''But as committed as we are to further progress, we
must be as committed to ensuring ... the safety of those making
these new discoveries possible. These new actions are a critical
first step.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the FDA's main weapon for safety violations is shutting
down the worrisome experiment. That's important when an experiment
imminently threatens participants. But often the patient risk isn't
that immediate, so the FDA is reluctant to take a step that Henney
called draconian. The FDA hopes fines will make more scientists
behave.
</P>
<P>
   Although the FDA already fines certain medical companies for
various violations, Congress would have to approve this new type of
fine. It's not clear that lawmakers would have time to pass such a
bill this year, or that the Republican-led Congress, long
unfriendly to the FDA, would even approve. Sen. Bill Frist,
R-Tenn., a physician who has led Congress' investigation of patient
safety in clinical trials, did not comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among other steps the agency is taking immediately:
</P>
<P>
   --Scientists must prove how well participants were informed of an
experiment's risks, including telling them about unexpected risks
that arise after a study begins.
</P>
<P>
   --IRBs and any clinical investigator who receives federal funding
must get special training in patient safety and bioethics.
</P>
<P>
   --Early-stage clinical trials will undergo more of the intensive
patient monitoring now mostly reserved for end-stage, or Phase III,
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   --Scientists must disclose to study participants any financial
interest in the treatment they're testing.

<HEADLINE> House Bill Backs Defibrillators  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House approved legislation Tuesday that
would increase public availability of a medical device that could
save thousands of people stricken with heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, passed 415-2 and sent to the Senate, directs
the Health and Human Services secretary to develop guidelines for
placing automatic external defibrillators (AED) in federal
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also protects from lawsuits any person who provides
emergency medical care with a defibrillator.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., chief sponsor of the bill, said
between 200,000 and 300,000 Americans die every year from sudden
cardiac arrest. He said up to 30 percent of these victims could be
saved if they had access to immediate medical treatment, including
defibrillation.
</P>
<P>
   The laptop-sized device automatically measures a victim's heart
rate to determine whether an electric shock is needed to restore
the heart's rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   Stearns said it is ''inexcusable that we do not have these
lifesaving devices widely available in federal buildings across the
United States. We need to be a role model for the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lois Capps, D-Calif., a former nurse, said a heart attack
victim's chances of survival drop 10 percent for every minute of
delay in applying a defibrillator.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation has been endorsed by the American Heart
Association and the American Red Cross. Voting no were Reps. Ron
Paul, R-Texas, and Mark Sanford, R-S.C.
</P>

<HEADLINE> House: Rename Building After Truman  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Foggy Bottom headquarters of the State
Department in Washington would be designated the Harry S Truman
Federal Building under a bill that passed the House on Tuesday on a
413-0 vote.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's sponsor Rep. Ike Skelton, like Truman a Missouri
Democrat, said renaming the State Department building would be a
fitting tribute to the nation's 33rd president, who ''contributed
so much to the American people and to the citizens of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers noted that Truman, who rose to the presidency after
the death of Franklin Roosevelt in 1945, led the nation during a
tumultuous period in world affairs, overseeing the dropping of the
atomic bombs on Japan, the end of World War II, the Marshall Plan
to rebuild Europe, the birth of Israel, the beginning of the Cold
War and the Berlin airlift and the outbreak of the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   The bill needs Senate action before it goes to the president for
his signature.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Munitions Sales Eased  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon and State Department announced
jointly on Tuesday an easing of restrictions on sale of U.S.
munitions abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, a single license will cover an entire weapons
program involving several subcontractors. And the licenses will be
valid for eight years, not the current four years.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules apply to deals with the NATO allies, Japan and
Australia. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is due to make an
announcement Wednesday at a meeting with allied foreign ministers
in Florence, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   It also applies to joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
   American companies will be able to compete more effectively with
European firms and are enthusiastic about the changes, officials
told reporters at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations also will make it easier for the allies to
share equipment in conflicts such as the one in Kosovo. U.S. forces
found licensing restrictions sometimes stopped them from providing
allies with American technology, the officials said..
</P>
<P>
   In some instance, licenses will be issued within 10 days.
Companies cleared for a project may not have to be licensed for a
second one under the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said controls on allies' transfer of U.S. weapons
and technology to other countries would be tightened under the new
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, a list of so-called third countries
eligible to receive U.S. technology will be drawn up.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, Australia and Japan account for more than $17 billion, or
68 percent, of U.S. export licenses.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department currently reviews about 45,000 license
applications a year, of which about 12,000 are also reviewed by the
Pentagon because of security concerns.

<HEADLINE> House Boosts GI Bill Funding  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's veterans would get more money to
help with college costs under a bill passed in the House Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which passed 417-0, would increase benefits under
the current Montgomery GI Bill, the longtime federal law that pays
veterans' college costs, from $536 a month for a nine-month term to
$600 beginning Oct. 1. The payment would rise to $720 a month in
2002.
</P>
<P>
   The increase comes after lobbying by veterans groups who have
complained that the current amount, which equals about $4,824 a
year, is sorely inadequate to meet the rising costs of college.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lane Evans of Illinois, the ranking Democrat on the
Veterans Affairs Committee, called the legislation ''a down payment
on closing that gap.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and some lawmakers have pushed for more money,
although the White House released a statement saying it supported
passage of the House bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will work with the Congress to seek consideration of our
alternative proposal,'' the administration said, adding that
''improvements like these are essential to ensuring that veterans
and their survivors and descendants can afford higher education or
professional training.''
</P>
<P>
   Some veterans groups said they are pleased with the funding but
concerned it falls short of the amount needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a step in the right direction,'' said Larry Rhea,
director of legislative affairs for the Non Commissioned Officers
Association. But, he added, ''certainly, we're going to be doing
everything we can to find senators who will pick up the banner, to
see if we can't build on it.''

<HEADLINE> Army Prepares for Laser Weapon Test  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Army said Tuesday it is making final
preparations for a test intended to prove that a new laser weapon
can shoot down the kind of short-range rockets that threaten
northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The test may be held as soon as Wednesday, said one Army
official who spoke on condition of anonymity. An Army announcement
of the test at White Sands Missile Range, N.M., said it would be
''before the end of May.''
</P>
<P>
   The importance of the laser weapon to Israeli security is
underscored by the chaos that erupted this week along Israel's
border with south Lebanon when Israel's allied militia in the area
collapsed. The militia for years had occupied a security zone there
meant to protect Israel from Katyusha rocket attacks.
</P>
<P>
   A string of rocket attacks in early 1996 prompted President
Clinton to approve a crash program by the Army and the Israeli
Ministry of Defense to develop the Tactical High Energy Laser. Army
officials plan to turn the $250 million weapon over to Israel this
fall if a series of scheduled tests prove that it is effective.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bacon, spokesman for Defense Secretary William Cohen,
said Tuesday it was up to Israel to disclose how and when it plans
to deploy the new laser weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Israel sought the weapon precisely to deal with this type of
threat,'' he said, referring to Katyusha rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon was asked whether the Clinton administration was prepared
to contribute to an enlarged U.N. peacekeeping force in southern
Lebanon, as a means of stabilizing the situation after Israel
completes with pullout.
</P>
<P>
   ''We certainly are prepared to provide assistance if we get
specific requests,'' he said. ''I don't believe we have at this
stage. We have not talked about committing manpower to that force.
A number of other countries have. But we are willing to provide
assistance if we find we can help and if there's a need for us to
do so.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday at White Sands, officials tested the laser's system
for tracking a Katyusha rocket armed with a dummy warhead. The next
step, possibly Wednesday or Thursday, will be to fire the laser for
the first time at a Katyusha rocket in flight with a real warhead.
Later it will attempt to shoot down multiple rockets.
</P>
<P>
   The laser weapon is being built under contract by
Cleveland-based TRW Space and Laser Programs Division.

<HEADLINE> Senate To Vote on Judges  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate will vote on 16 of President
Clinton's nominees to lifetime judgeships as part of a deal that
gives Republicans a chance to place on the Federal Election
Commission a professor who disagrees with much of federal election
law.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats blocked the FEC nomination of Bradley A. Smith for
months, but gave in Tuesday under pressure from Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss., who threatened to thwart the judicial
nominations, some of which were pending for a year, and 47 Clinton
appointments to other posts.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., made it clear he
didn't like the move.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that stinks. I think it's wrong,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., who along with Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., has been trying to get the Senate to consider major
changes in the law that governs the flow of money to political
campaigns, also expressed disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the country suffers when these kinds of games are
played,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has been the bargaining chip for Democrats to get some of
Clinton's judicial nominations through the Senate. Republicans,
hoping to regain the White House after eight years of Clinton's
presidency, have done little this year to expedite approval of
Clinton's nominees to lifetime judgeships.
</P>
<P>
   Only seven judges have been approved by the Senate this year.
Besides the 16 on the Senate calendar, 36 are awaiting approval by
the Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   As debate began on giving Smith a six-year term on the
six-member FEC, McCain and Feingold were among the first to state
their opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the most extreme nominee that I have seen for any
position in my years here since 1987,'' McCain said. ''Sending Brad
Smith to the FEC is akin to confirming a conscientious objector to
be secretary of defense.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We need FEC commissioners that believe in the laws that they
are sworn to uphold,'' Feingold said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. and Smith's chief backer in the
Senate, said the criticism was unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one who knows Brad Smith personally or professionally,
including self-avowed reformers, believes that he will fail to
enforce the election laws as enacted by Congress or to fulfill his
duties in a fair and evenhanded manner,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who teaches law at Capital University in Columbus, Ohio,
believes limits on federal campaign contributions are
unconstitutional and that the federal campaign law is so riddled
with loopholes it should be repealed.
</P>
<P>
   He has been a prolific writer and lecturer on that subject -- one
Supreme Court decision quoted his work in both the majority and
dissenting opinions -- and his academic papers are frequently quoted
by foes of efforts to restrict more kinds of political donations.
</P>
<P>
   But in facing senators during his confirmation hearing, Smith
said it's the job of Congress, not the FEC, to write laws. He
assured senators he would ''enforce the law as it is, even when I
disagree with the law.''
</P>
<P>
   By tradition, each party chooses three of the six FEC
commissioners. Clinton nominated Smith only after Senate
Republicans refused multiple requests that they offer another name
for the Republican vacancy on the board.
</P>
<P>
   Common Cause, which helped organize a lobbying campaign that
persuaded Clinton to delay a formal nomination of Smith for nearly
a year, still hoped to defeat him.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it's a difference of five or six senators right
now,'' said the group's president, Scott Harshbarger. ''It depends
on how much attention the Senate pays to Senator McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., announced he won't oppose Smith
out of respect for the system by which FEC members are selected.
Calling Smith ''controversial but otherwise well-qualified,'' Dodd
said, ''You can disagree with him, and I do -- vehemently -- but he
is certainly qualified to serve on the FEC.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he expected the Senate to vote Wednesday on Smith and
the other nominees.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the federal judges, they include: Jay Johnson to
be director of the Mint; Earl Anthony Wayne to be assistant
secretary of state; Christopher Hill to be ambassador to Poland;
Donnie Marshall to be head of the Drug Enforcement Administration;
Michelle Smith to be assistant secretary of the treasury; U.S.
attorneys for Kentucky and Missouri and members of the National
Transportation Safety Board, Nuclear Regulatory Commission and
other federal panels.
</P>
<P>
   FEC Commissioner Danny Lee McDonald, a Democrat, also is up for
confirmation. Lott said the Senate would vote on his nomination
after it considers Smith.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Vote on Pinochet Is Secret  </HEADLINE>
By EDUARDO GALLARDO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- A Chilean court voted Tuesday on whether
Gen. Augusto Pinochet will be forced to stand trial on charges of
human rights violations, but said the ruling will be made public
within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''A decision has been made,'' Ruben Ballesteros, president of
the Santiago Court of Appeals said after the surprise session by
the court's 22 judges.
</P>
<P>
   ''The announcement will be made after the ruling has been
written and signed by all the judges, in one or two weeks''
Ballesteros said after the 90-minute session.
</P>
<P>
   Small groups Pinochet supporters and opponents gathered outside
the court Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled on whether the former dictator should be
stripped of the immunity from prosecution he currently enjoys as a
senator-for-life -- a post he created for himself during his 17-year
regime. If lifted, he could be put on trial for alleged abuses that
occurred after his 1973 coup against Chile's elected government.
</P>
<P>
   According to an official report compiled by the civilian
government that succeeded Pinochet, 3,191 people died or
disappeared under Pinochet's military rule.
</P>
<P>
   There were no indications of what decision the judges had
reached.
</P>
<P>
   The judges based their undisclosed ruling on arguments last
month by seven lawyers for the plaintiffs and one for Pinochet, and
on a report by Judge Juan Guzman, who is handling 108 criminal
complaints against the former dictator.
</P>
<P>
   The military, especially the army, remain loyal to Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   A ruling against Pinochet ''would not be satisfactory for us,''
said army chief Gen. Ricardo Izurieta, prompting criticism from
anti-Pinochet politicians and human rights activists who claimed
the remark placed undue military pressure on the court.
</P>
<P>
   President Ricardo Lagos, a socialist who was briefly jailed
under Pinochet, has vowed to make sure the court ruling will be
respected and urged ''all sectors in the country'' to refrain from
pressuring the court.
</P>
<P>
   The case picked by Guzman to seek the lifting of Pinochet's
immunity and his trial is one of the most emblematic of the abuses
under his regime: the so-called ''caravan of death.'' It refers to
a group of officers who toured several cities soon after the coup,
dragging political prisoners from jail and executing them.
</P>
<P>
   While 75 people were killed, Guzman centered his case against
Pinochet on 19 of them who are still missing, calling the situation
''a case of ongoing kidnapping.''
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing followers of Pinochet angrily reject the judge's
stance.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a ridiculous joke,'' said congressman Pablo Longueira,
head of the Independent Democratic Union and a staunch Pinochet
supporter. ''We all know those people are dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Pinochet had defended himself through retired Gen.
Luis Cortes, a close associate. After meeting with Pinochet, Cortes
said: ''He told me: 'Please tell everybody that I never ordered
anybody to be killed or tortured.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet returned home in February after being held for 16
months in London, where he blocked efforts to be extradited to
Spain for trial. He was released by Britain after doctors there
determined he was physically and mentally unfit for trial. The
conclusion was supported by Pinochet's doctors in Chile.

<HEADLINE> Obscenity Prosecutions Criticized  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans charged Tuesday that the
Justice Department is ignoring the growth in online obscenity cases
in its focus on online child pornography.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's where the resources of the Justice Department are being
focused,'' said Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla., during a hearing of
the House Commerce subcommittee on telecommunication, trade and
consumer protection. ''Obscenity is not the same thing as child
pornography.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Assistant Attorney General Alan Gershel admitted that the
department's online enforcement efforts focuses on child
pornography ''primarily but not exclusively'' to obscenity but
argued that online child pornography was the worst form of
obscenity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would argue, Congressman, that our priorities are right
where they should be today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the department's focus on online child pornography obviously
isn't working with the continuing explosion on the Internet, said
Rep. Chip Pickering, R-Miss. He said the department could do better
by focusing on obscenity cases as strongly as it focuses on child
pornography cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until you address both, you're going to see an increase in
child pornography,'' Pickering said.
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing, Gershel touted the increase in the number of
online child pornography cases by the Justice Department, pointing
to the jump to 510 cases filed in fiscal year 1999 from the 127
filed during the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But Pickering pointed out that there were 126 convictions on
obscenity charges between 1989-95, with at least $24 million in
fines and forfeitures. ''How many convictions have there been on
obscenity charges since 1995?'' Pickering asked Gershel.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy assistant attorney general said he didn't have the
information with them and refused to try to guess.
</P>
<P>
   ''That shows where your priorities are,'' Pickering said.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokeswoman later said there were 55
obscenity prosecutions between 1996-98 but did not know how many of
them were online cases, how many ended in convictions or how much
in fines and forfeitures the convictions brought.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting started out on a bad note between the Justice
Department and the House Republicans, with subcommittee chairman
Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., accusing Gershel of refusing to testify
after online decency advocates because he didn't want to hear and
respond to their complaints that the Justice Department wasn't
doing enough to fight online pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Gershel, who had been at the hearing before it began but left,
returned after testimony had began. He said later that his
departure had nothing to do with the advocates' testimony but the
committee members were ''entitled to their own opinion.''

<HEADLINE> Zion National Park Bans Cars  </HEADLINE>
By HANNAH WOLFSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZION NATIONAL PARK, Utah (AP) -- In recent years, the route
through the stunning red cliffs of Zion Canyon has become a big,
beautiful parking lot, filled with tour buses, double-parked motor
homes, and bad tempers.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to restore the peace and quiet that gave Zion its
name, the national park on Tuesday became the first outside of
Alaska to ban nearly all cars from its most popular section.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, tourists must now take shuttles from the new
visitor center to travel up the canyon.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in years Tuesday, it was easy to slow down
and experience the park -- to hear the sound of the Virgin River and
even catch the buzz of a hummingbird that stopped to investigate
one shuttle stop.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at crowded national parks across the country said it
could be a glimpse of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it would be safe to say that in 10 or 20 years a
number of parks may have systems'' like this, said National Park
Service spokeswoman Carol Anthony. ''Visitation to the national
parks has just been increasing at a phenomenal rate, and I think
that we're finally just facing the issue, to be quite frank.''
</P>
<P>
   In Zion, transportation first became a hot topic in 1977, when
the park -- designed to handle about a million people a year -- had
1.4 million visitors. A master plan written that year declared
demand would soon outstrip the supply of parking spaces.
</P>
<P>
   The park now gets an estimated 2.5 million visitors each year.
In the peak season of April through October, that translates to an
average of 2,000 cars and 20 tour buses a day. On a busy holiday
weekend, as many as 3,000 vehicles may visit the narrow, six-mile
canyon in a day -- all of them trying to squeeze into 450 parking
spaces.
</P>
<P>
   ''Frayed tempers, people hollering at each other, people double-
and triple- parked, destroying the vegetation,'' said Zion
spokesman Denny Davies. ''We just decided that one of the criterion
we wanted was to restore this place to peace and quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   One option was voluntary shuttles, like those running at several
national parks. But Zion officials worried too few people would
leave their cars behind.
</P>
<P>
   They also considered widening the road or adding more parking
lots.
</P>
<P>
   ''But one of the primary reasons that any national park has been
established is to preserve and protect the resources that are
there,'' Davies said. ''So if you start carving away the hillside
to make parking lots, you're going at cross purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   They decided on mandatory, propane-powered shuttles from the
visitor center to the end of the six-mile road, with seven stops in
between. Other shuttles will loop through the town of Springdale,
at the park's entrance, picking up visitors and dropping them at
the visitor center.
</P>
<P>
   The car ban is not absolute. Those driving through the park on
State Route 9 will still be able to use the first couple of miles
of the canyon road. Visitors with reservations at the Zion Park
Lodge will receive parking passes, and some special permits for
rock climbers and backcountry campers will be granted.
</P>
<P>
   Managers at Yosemite and the south rim of the Grand Canyon have
been considering similar transit plans for years. But Zion, with
its smaller scale and seven-month high season, leapfrogged over
those better-known parks, where shuttles should be up and running
in two years.
</P>
<P>
   One thing officials want to see is how the $28 million system
goes over with the public. On Tuesday, most shuttle riders -- even
those surprised to find they couldn't drive their car into Zion
Canyon -- said they could see the need for a transit system.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a great idea,'' Bill Ellard of Estes Park, Colo.,
said as he waited for a bus. ''This is a historical event and we
walked right into it.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the buses fell behind schedule, there were more than a
few complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of putting the money into all these shuttles and a big
old visitors center, put the money into a parking lot!'' said
Kimberly Kalbfleisch of Phoenix, traveling with her husband and
four daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have limited time for vacation and we don't want to spend
our time waiting for a shuttle. We could have been there in five
minutes in our car, gone on our hike and gone on our way.''

<HEADLINE> Kenya Rations Power in Shortfall  </HEADLINE>
By CHEGE MBITIRU
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- With a rain shortage drying up lakes that
power hydroelectric dams, Kenya announced stringent power-rationing
Tuesday with 12-hour cuts, six days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers say existing rationing already is destroying the
shrinking industrial base in this East African nation of 29 million
and that further reductions will only make things worse.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Monday, all domestic users will experience power cuts
from 6:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., manufacturers from 6:30 p.m. to 6:30
a.m., Energy Minister Francis Masakhalia said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyans are worried that the 12-hour power cuts will cause an
array of problems, everything from food spoiling without
refrigeration to employers being forced to lay off staff.
</P>
<P>
   ''Arrangements have been made to ensure that essential services
are not interrupted,'' Masakhalia told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   He said police patrols will be substantially increased in
industrial areas to ensure security during the shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The Kenya Power and Lighting Co., a partially government-owned
monopoly that distributes power generated by the recently split-off
Kenya Electricity Generating Co., introduced six-hour, three days a
week, power cuts in September.
</P>
<P>
   The rationing will not apply in the central business district of
the capital, Nairobi, where most government offices are also
located.
</P>
<P>
   Critics accuse the Ministry of Energy of failing to act on
predictions last November that a lack in April-May rains would hurt
the hydroelectric plants that produce most of Kenya's electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The national daily power output has dropped from 580 megawatts
to 480 megawatts. New York, in comparison, uses more than 30,000
megawatts at peak summer demand.
</P>
<P>
   Masakhalia said the government is negotiating to buy 30
megawatts from neighboring Uganda and considering renting a diesel
power plant and repairing a retired 30 megawatt diesel plant at the
Indian Ocean port of Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
   Renting a plant needed to meet the current average 180 megawatt
shortfall at peak hours will cost $10 million a month and consume
diesel worth $20 million, a cost that would have to be passed on to
consumers, the energy minister said.
</P>
<P>
   Masakhalia said construction is under way on at least six
geothermal and thermal plants to reduce dependency on
hydroelectricity, but none of the plants will be operational before
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Although rainfall is expected to increase slightly between May
and August, it will not improve water levels in dams until
September, when the yearly short rains begin.

<HEADLINE> Gov't: Cash In Mature Bonds  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Uncle Sam wants you to check your attic,
basement and closets for forgotten savings bonds.
</P>
<P>
   More than $7 billion worth of savings bonds have matured -- but
haven't been redeemed. The Treasury Department's Bureau of Public
Debt hopes to change that.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau is launching a radio and print advertising campaign
aimed at encouraging savings bond owners to cash in the matured
bonds they hold. Ads are expected to begin surfacing sometime next
week, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want those Americans who are holding more than $7 billion
in matured savings bonds to put their money back to work for
them,'' said Van Zeck, commissioner of the Public Debt.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hoping that increased awareness of when bonds stop
earning interest will cause people to take a look at their bonds
and redeem or exchange the matured bonds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the bonds are worth five, even 10 times, what people
paid for them, the bureau said. For instance, a person who paid $75
for a $100 Series E bond back in April 1960 would find that bond is
worth about $770 today.
</P>
<P>
   Publications and radio stations that opt to use the ads will do
so as a public service. The bureau is not buying air time or print
space, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   One ad shows a smiling woman holding four bonds with the
caption:'' I found buried treasure in my garage.'' The ad goes on
to say: ''More than 40 years ago, Grandma gave you some Series E
savings bonds. So you put them in a safe place and forgot about
them -- until now.''
</P>
<P>
   People who want to find out the value of their savings bonds,
whether or not they are still earning interest and other related
information, can do so over the Internet by going to
www.savingsbonds.gov.

<HEADLINE> Precedent Unclear in Clinton Case  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID A. LIEB
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Despite President Clinton's assertion
that precedent is on his side in his fight against disbarment,
there are few -- if any -- cases on which to make a direct
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no case like this in Arkansas,'' said Howard Brill, a
legal ethics professor at the University of Arkansas who helped
write the state's code of conduct for lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case is distinguished because the lawyer, Mr. Clinton,
was not acting like a lawyer, he was acting as a litigant, a
private party. And there has been no criminal conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is also unusual because the president was impeached by
the House, acquitted by the Senate and later fined for contempt of
court by a federal judge who referred Clinton to the state's legal
disciplinary panel.
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas Supreme Court Committee on Professional Conduct on
Monday recommended that Clinton lose his Arkansas law license for
''serious misconduct'' relating to his false testimony about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for the committee will argue the case before a
circuit judge in Little Rock, who could disbar Clinton, impose a
lesser punishment or dismiss the recommendation altogether. Either
side could appeal to the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said the committee, made up of five lawyers and a
retired schoolteacher, is treating him more severely than other
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are clear precedents where more significant kinds of
conduct ... led to nowhere near this kind of decision,'' Clinton
said Monday night on ''NBC Nightly News.'' ''This decision
contradicts all the cases on point that the committee has ever
decided in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Past Arkansas cases include numerous lawyers, some of them
politicians, who were disbarred after criminal convictions. Others
have lost their law license without convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, the state Supreme Court disbarred Little Rock lawyer
P.A. ''Les'' Hollingsworth, a former member of the high court. The
committee had recommended disbarment over allegations that
Hollingsworth diverted a client's estate money for his own use. The
circuit judge had imposed a six-month suspension, prompting an
appeal to the high court.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, a former U.S. attorney who helped handle
the impeachment case against Clinton in the Senate, said the
Hollingsworth case weighs against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Les Hollingsworth is a good example of someone who has
contributed mightily to the civil rights movement, to the
community,'' said Hutchinson, R-Ark. ''The Arkansas Supreme Court
disbarred him. That's a pretty forceful view.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson said he also prosecuted a case in the 1980s in which
an attorney was accused of mishandling his client's funds. Although
the man was acquitted, he later was disbarred anyway, Hutchinson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Law professor John DiPippa of the University of Arkansas at
Little Rock said there are at least four cases that could weigh in
Clinton's favor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, North Little Rock lawyer John Bingham was reprimanded --
but not disbarred -- for offering false evidence to the Arkansas
Beverage Control Board when it was considering an alcohol permit
application for a corporation on which he was the
secretary-treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, North Little Rock lawyer Milas Hale III was
reprimanded for dishonest, deceitful and misleading actions
relating to a parent's complaint against a Catholic school and
church, of which he was a leader.
</P>
<P>
   DiPippa also cited a 1998 case in which Fayetteville lawyer Dan
Ivy was cautioned for filing a frivolous lawsuit. Also, in a 1986
case, Bald Knob lawyer Charles Pearrow was reprimanded for
misrepresenting the condition of property that he sold.
</P>
<P>
   DiPippi said each of the cases contains elements of the Clinton
case -- actions that were misleading or hindered justice, and were
not necessarily committed while in the role of an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   DiPippa himself believes Clinton should be held to a higher
standard as president. He said disbarment would be too severe a
punishment and reprimand would be too light, so he suggested a
suspension, ''to send a message to other people, other lawyers,
that when they are in a similar situation they don't do the same
thing.''

<HEADLINE> Pscyh Hospital Probes Erratic  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal inspections of the nation's
psychiatric hospitals are spotty, with some hospitals going
unexamined for more than five years, according to government
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ''The extent to which the system of oversight is holding
psychiatric hospitals accountable for patient care is
questionable,'' Health and Human Services Inspector General June
Gibbs Brown said in a report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report blamed the problems in part on declining money for
the inspections, saying the budget dropped from $3 million in 1993
to $670,000 in 1998. During that period, the number of inspectors
contracted by the federal government fell from 147 to 76.
</P>
<P>
   Brown praised inspectors for their efforts to talk directly with
patients and staff when they do visit the hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy-Ann DeParle, administrator of the HHS agency that oversees
the inspections, said in a letter responding to the report that the
inspection budget has been rising since 1998, and that she has
requested $2 million from Congress for 2001, the same as this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We anticipate reducing the interval between surveys to three
years,'' DeParle wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The number of inspections each year fell from 413 in 1993 to 146
in 1998, the report said. Of the 611 freestanding psychiatric
hospitals examined in the report, 37 have gone five years or more
without inspection and three have gone 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatric hospitals must undergo federal inspections as one
condition of participation in Medicare or Medicaid, the national
health insurance programs for elderly, disabled and low-income
Americans. Congress has directed federal inspectors to focus on the
hospitals' medical record keeping and staffing.
</P>
<P>
   Additional inspections looking at other aspects of care are
required as well, and are generally conducted either by state
regulators or by a national board called the Joint Commission on
Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The report said coordination between the three sets of
inspectors is inadequate and responsibility is not clearly defined
for key areas, such as making sure hospitals make appropriate plans
for patients being discharged.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Receives Peace Award  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton on Tuesday received the
Seeds of Peace award for his efforts to achieve peace in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton received the award during a closed ceremony at the White
House. It was presented by participants in the Seeds of Peace
program, which unites young people from Middle Eastern nations to
work on conflict resolution and building friendships.
</P>
<P>
   The award is given each year to a world leader who has shown
''courage and conviction'' in pursuing peace in the Middle East.
Previous winners include U.N. Secretary Kofi Annan, late Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, the late King Hussein of Jordan and his wife, Queen Noor.

<HEADLINE> Navy Gives Potential Pilots Tryout  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- The Navy is giving college students and
graduates a one-week aviation tryout to boost recruitment and
reduce a flight-training dropout rate that can be as high as 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   One purpose is to weed out those who lack the commitment or
physical and mental attributes necessary to get through rigorous
and expensive training programs for pilots and navigators.
</P>
<P>
   ''The other part of this is the motivational aspect, bringing
them down here and giving them an aviation, quasi-Top Gun
experience and getting them feeling good and pumped up about the
fact that they want to do this,'' said Capt. A.J. Gallardo.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, the Navy has brought 100 young men and women to
Pensacola Naval Air Station in small groups once a month for the
Aviation Certification Evaluation and Screening Program.
</P>
<P>
   Participants undergo physical training and swimming tests, get
medical examinations and take rides in turboprop training planes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to comprehend what it is like until you get down
here and see how the whole process works,'' said Dan Brown, 26, a
copy machine salesman who graduated from the University of
Wisconsin in 1996 and opted to stick with flight training.
''Nothing was sugarcoated.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy plans to expand the program next year to Naval Academy
graduates and students in Officer Candidate School.

<HEADLINE> Commission Proposes German Reform  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Germany must shed its historical trepidation and
spend more money to create a lean, modern and more professional
military, a high-level commission recommended Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's proposals marked a sea change for the German
military, formed from the ashes of World War II and defined by the
Cold War front line that ran through the country. They also
addressed concerns of the United States, which has appealed to
European countries to take a stronger role in NATO.
</P>
<P>
   While proposing that the total armed forces be cut from about
338,000 to 240,000 by 2006, the panel headed by former President
Richard von Weizsaecker said the number of troops ready for action
should be increased from about 60,000 to 140,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Bundeswehr -- the German army -- is ''too big, ill-composed
and increasingly out of step with the times,'' wrote the
government-appointed panel, which includes religious and business
leaders and academic experts.
</P>
<P>
   Defense spending should be increased to modernize equipment, and
the armed forces should be ready to fully participate in two crisis
response operations at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's statements that Germans
are ready for change, the reforms suggested by the panel are
unlikely to make it past the government without substantial
modifications.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping has not presented details of
his own reforms, but German media have reported that he will
suggest cutting troops to 280,000 and propose reducing mandatory
service from a current 10 to nine months. The Cabinet was due to
discuss the report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most hotly debated issues addressed in the report is
conscription. The panel proposed cutting the number of those
obligated to do the 10-month mandatory service from 130,000 to
30,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Greens party, the junior partner in government with
Schroeder's Social Democrats, has called for the total elimination
of conscription. The military, however, wants to maintain it to
keep the armed forces from becoming too professional, thus losing
its status of ''citizens' army.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel argued that the army had insufficient manpower and
equipment to fulfill Germany's international obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The contributions to the internationally agreed tasks assured
by Germany's policy-makers cannot be provided by its armed forces,
at least not in the longer run,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen pointed to deficiencies
within Europe during a defense summit in Germany earlier this year.
He reminded Europeans that the United States flew half of all the
combat missions and two-thirds of all air support missions during
the 78-day Kosovo war.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen had earlier singled out Germany for criticism as being in
the bottom third of NATO countries in defense spending.
</P>
<P>
   Getting more money out of a strapped German budget may not be
easy, after parliament last year approved an austerity program that
slashes military spending by $8.4 billion from 2000-2003.
Weizsaecker said Tuesday that the extra costs for modernizing the
military would lead to savings down the road when the number of
forces are reduced.

<HEADLINE> Deal on Border Crossings Reached  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Immigration and Naturalization Service
would keep a national computer database of information collected
from foreigners as they enter and leave the country under
legislation passed Tuesday by the House.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, approved on a voice vote, grew out of negotiations
between lawmakers who favor questioning and tracking all foreigners
to keep them from overstaying their visas and Northern congressmen
who fear such a move would create traffic jams at Canadian border
points.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which is expected to come up in the Senate later this
week, does not call for the INS or the State Department to elicit
any more information from foreigners than currently is collected by
agents, such as name, country of origin and date of birth.
</P>
<P>
   But the information would have to be consolidated into a
database that could be connected with law enforcement computers and
used to alert authorities when a known criminal tries to enter or
leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without this information, aliens can slip through the cracks,
as we saw in the case of Mr. Resendiz, the recently convicted
railroad killer,'' said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, the bill's
sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Illegal immigrant Angel Maturino Resendiz was released back to
Mexico last year by INS officials who didn't know he was wanted for
questioning about murders near U.S. rail lines. He later was
captured and last week was convicted by a Texas jury of raping and
murdering a doctor. He has admitted to eight other killings.
</P>
<P>
   In an investigation of the Resendiz case last March, the Justice
Department's inspector general recommended the INS and FBI link
their computerized fingerprint systems to identify suspects trying
to cross the border.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill would block a new law set to take effect next
year requiring border agents to question and track each foreigner
who travels in and out of the country. Many lawmakers from states
along the Canadian border opposed the law, saying it would hold up
traffic, hurting commerce and tourism.
</P>
<P>
   ''As little as a fraction of a minute added to the production
time of these vehicles would add to miles and miles of snarled
traffic on both sides of the border,'' said Rep. John Conyers,
D-Mich., whose Detroit district includes the busy border with
Windsor, Ontario. ''These prices are far too high to pay for a data
collection system that sadly was unlikely to reach its primary
objective.''

<HEADLINE> House Approves Gold Medal for Pope  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Tuesday to award the
Congressional Gold Medal to Pope John Paul II in recognition of his
contributions to peace and religious understanding.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, passed 416-1, praised the spiritual leader of 1
billion Catholics for dedicating his pontificate ''to the freedom
and dignity of every individual human being'' and using ''his moral
authority to hasten the fall of godless totalitarian regimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, who introduced the bill, said the former
Polish bishop who became pope 22 years ago ''has sundered despotism
and ennobled faith by displaying the courage and conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill directs the president to determine the provisions by
which the medal will be awarded. The Treasury secretary will
determine the inscriptions to be placed on the medal.
</P>
<P>
   It also allows for bronze duplicates to be made for resale at a
price sufficient to cover the cost of the duplicates.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Banking Committee is to take up the measure on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Congress awarded the Congressional Gold
Medal, its highest civilian honor, to Cardinal John O'Connor, who
died this month.
</P>
<P>
   Others who have received the award include George Washington,
Winston Churchill, Bob Hope and Mother Teresa.
</P>
<P>
   The single no vote was cast by Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Down 200; Dow Off 120  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index fell nearly 200
points Tuesday, sinking to its lowest close since last November and
erasing nearly all the spectacular gains of its 1999-2000 rally as
investors once again abandoned technology shares. Worries over
rising interest rates prevented buyers from stepping in to stem the
decline.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the risks are on the table now,'' said Richard E. Cripps,
chief market strategist at Legg Mason in Baltimore. ''We have
rising interest rates, an effort to slow the economy and high
valuations. Other than than lower stock prices, there's nothing to
bring investors back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq fell 199.66 to 3,164.55. The Nasdaq hadn't closed
that low since Nov. 10, 1999, when the index was in the earliest
stages of its dramatic ascent that culminated in its March 10
closing high of 5,048.62. With Tuesday's losses, the Nasdaq is now
down a stunning 37 percent from that record.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness in technology stocks once again undermined the
broader market. The Dow Jones industrial average, which flirted
with positive territory at several points, finished down 120.28 at
10,422.27.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also fell. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
dropped 26.86 to 1,373.86, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller
companies fell 12.66 to 459.01.
</P>
<P>
   Traders endured another session of relatively low volume, which
highlighted the utter absence of willing buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one wants to step forward and buy anything,'' said Larry
Lawler, manager of equity trading at Dreyfus Corp. in New York.
''There's great fear out there, and the sellers are just more
aggressive than the buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Among technology stocks that continued their long, steady slide
were Cisco Systems, down 4 45/64 to 50 35/64; Intel, which lost 8{
to 109~ and Oracle, down 5 3/16 to 62|.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks were mostly lower, too. Amazon.com fell 5 3/16
to 46 11/16 and eBay plummeted 20 3/16 to 116.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are shedding high-priced technology stocks that appear
overvalued in an environment of inflation pressures and rising
interest rates. While investors earlier this year convinced
themselves that the rapid growth rates of technology companies
would enable them to outrun rising rates -- a belief that kept
investors exuberantly buying high-tech shares -- many now believe
that even fast growth won't be enough to justify their still-high
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like it or not, inflation is not going to help the growth
areas of the market,'' Lawler said.
</P>
<P>
   With the Nasdaq having retreated to levels of last fall, it was
hard to determine if investors now believe the extended rally in
high-tech was unwarranted, or if they never expected the Federal
Reserve to raise interest rates so high over the past year. The Fed
has pushed rates higher six times since June 30, a total increase
of 1.75 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered buying interest Tuesday was concentrated in the
blue-chip stocks that dominate the Dow. Citigroup rose 1 to 62 5/16
and Merck rose 1{ to 73 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell, a Dow component, edged up [ to 53]. PaineWebber
analyst David Bleustein launched coverage on the stock with a
''buy'' rating, applauding Honeywell's efforts to capitalize on
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts are anticipating weakness at least until
Thursday, when the next wave of economic data hits the market. The
Commerce Department will issue its preliminary report on
first-quarter gross domestic product, and the National Association
of Realtors will report on existing home sales for April.
</P>
<P>
   Both reports could offer some indication of whether the Fed's
rate increases are successfully slowing the economy. Analysts said
signs of moderate growth could calm the distressed market.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we are now needing is a change in psychology,'' Cripps
said. ''Either economic statistics showing slower growth, or a
decline to the point that investors can gain conviction that it
can't go much lower.''
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 1.03
billion shares, compared with 1.04 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.4 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index 0.2 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 0.9
percent, and France's CAC-40 gained 0.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Investigation Thwarted  </HEADLINE>
By TIM SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROGBERI JUNCTION, Sierra Leone (AP) -- United Nations
investigators who arrived in this northern town Tuesday to try and
identify more than a half-dozen corpses -- which appeared to be U.N.
peacekeepers -- were stalled when they found army soldiers had
already buried the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The corpses were located Monday in Rogberi Junction -- the
front-line position in the battle against the rebel Revolutionary
United Front -- in the foxholes that Zambian U.N. peacekeepers had
dug weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are concerned that the bodies might be those of the
peacekeepers, a finding that would make them the latest victims of
the rebels. Tens of thousands of Sierra Leoneons were killed or
intentionally mutilated during Sierra Leone's eight-year civil war.
The conflict reignited earlier this month when the RUF gunned down
at least 19 people at a demonstration in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to bury the dead,'' said Sierra Leone Lt. Col. Edmund
Bangura, who commands the hundreds of soldiers positioned here.
</P>
<P>
   So the U.N. team interviewed the soldiers, examined the graves
and left with documents that had been recovered from the corpses,
said U.N. Spokesman David Wimhurst. He said once the town is more
secure -- the soldiers there repelled a rebel attack early Tuesday
morning -- U.N. officials would return to exhume the corpses.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers believed that eight bodies were interred, but were
not entirely sure because the corpses were so badly decomposed and
had been hacked into pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Three bodies, dressed in Zambian military uniforms bearing the
U.N. insignia, were seen by an Associated Press Television News
cameraman on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A gunbattle took place at Rogberi Junction on May 6, according
to the United Nations. But the advanced decomposition of the bodies
-- in some cases only whitened bones remained -- raised questions
about how long they had been there.
</P>
<P>
   ''The time is too short for their bodies to be decomposed to
that extent,'' said presidential spokesman Septimus Kai Kai.
</P>
<P>
   But the soldiers at Rogberi Junction said animals had eaten the
bodies, making it appear they had been dead for far longer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sierra Leone troops said they had fought back a rebel
attack Tuesday and that one of their own was killed in the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-government forces -- a ragtag coalition of formerly
disarmed government soldiers, ex- junta fighters and members of a
traditional militia known as the Kamajors -- captured one rebel, an
18-year-old who a number of soldiers were slapping and tormenting
later in the morning. One soldier appeared ready to stab him with a
bayonet before the commander stepped in and lead the captive away.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of explosions could be heard in the distance Tuesday
morning, but it was not clear what had caused them.
</P>
<P>
   In another blow to the embattled peacekeepers, two members of
Nigeria's contingent were killed Monday in a firefight at a U.N.
post in Freetown. That raised the confirmed death toll for the U.N.
peacekeepers to four.
</P>
<P>
   There was one piece of good news for the U.N. force: Twenty-nine
U.N. captives were released by the guerrillas Monday, adding to the
54 released a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The RUF rebels still hold about 250 of the 500 peacekeepers they
originally captured three weeks ago, and the latest developments
could complicate negotiations for their release.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Taylor, the president of neighboring Liberia and a
friend of the rebels, has sent a delegation to RUF camps in the
bush, and his envoys have negotiated the freedom of about half the
captives.
</P>
<P>
   ''We continue to be optimistic about this route to release the
hostages,'' Wimhurst said.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, meanwhile, announced it was reshuffling its troops in
Sierra Leone in preparation for quitting the West African nation by
mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   The British government has said the troops, deployed to assist
with the evacuation of European and Commonwealth citizens, will
leave once U.N. forces have been bolstered by troops from other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. contingent in Sierra Leone now numbers more than
10,000, the largest U.N. peacekeeping deployment in the world, and
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan recommended Monday that the
number of troops be increased to 16,500.

<HEADLINE> Citizenship Bill Passes Congress  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Capping a 10-year effort, the House gave final
approval Tuesday to legislation that would make it easier for
Laotians who fought with America during the Vietnam War to become
U.S. citizens. President Clinton is expected to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed without objection, waives the
English-language requirement for Laotians recruited by the CIA for
covert military actions during the war. Most of the Laotians are
Hmong, an ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the Hmong have found it difficult to learn
English because their language did not have a written form until
recently.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have after all passed a more important test than a
language test,'' said Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., whose state is
home to approximately 60,000 Hmong, the most of any state. ''They
risked their lives for American values, often to save U.S. service
personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   Vento, a 12-term House member who is retiring at the end of the
year because of lung cancer, first introduced the bill a decade
ago. He has called it one of his top legislative priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Smith, Washington director of Lao Veterans of America,
called the passage ''historic and a great victory for the Lao and
Hmong veterans of the U.S. Secret Army and their refugee families
across the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The House passed a version of the bill earlier this month, but
the Senate deleted a reference singling out the Lao Veterans of
America as one of the groups that would determine who is qualified
for citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill, which the House accepted Tuesday, authorizes
the Justice Department to consider documentation ''provided by
organizations maintaining records with respect to Hmong veterans or
their families.''
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 70,000 Hmong and Lao veterans in the
United States, and about half are not citizens. Most are permanent
residents but are not eligible to vote or hold a passport.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 371.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Guerrillas Fill Zone  </HEADLINE>
By ZEINA KARAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   BINT JBEIL, Lebanon (AP) -- For nearly two decades, Shiite Muslim
guerrillas fought to drive the Israelis out of Lebanon, trying
everything from suicide bombers and roadside bombs to setting up
medical clinics and soccer teams in a heart-and-minds campaign for
the support of their fellow Shiites.
</P>
<P>
   When the end came this week, the Israelis simply packed up and
left, often under cover of darkness, and the guerrillas of
Hezbollah and Amal filled the vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   With the departure of the Israelis, their proxy militia they had
supported in an effort to leave a buffer against Hezbollah attacks
rapidly imploded. The militiamen of the South Lebanon Army, despite
years of Israeli training, crumbled as its former fighters fled to
the Israeli border or surrendered to the Lebanese army.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, in contrast, maintained discipline and showed
determination.
</P>
<P>
   As though following a well-choreographed master plan, they went
straight to the abandoned Israeli and SLA outposts, looting them
and blowing them up.
</P>
<P>
   They handed out candy to civilians and stopped to direct traffic
on roads jammed by villagers returning to homes they had fled to
escape the fighting or conscription by the Christian-led SLA, whose
ranks over the years had become more than half Muslim through
coercion or desperation for a paying job.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas were praised by the returning villagers or those
who had stayed behind in the predominantly Shiite western part of
what Israel had called its security zone.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's thanks to the Islamic resistance that we're returning,''
said Linda Haidar, 22, who was only 4 years old when her family
left Teir Harfa.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congratulations to the resistance and its heroes on the return
of Hezbollah to Kounin,'' read a banner erected in a village just
north of Bint Jbeil, the largest Shiite town in the zone.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah guerrillas were showered with rice and rose petals,
hugs and kisses.
</P>
<P>
   They quickly set to work, planting their flags on rooftops,
electricity poles and in village squares. Soon the yellow banners --
showing a Kalashnikov rifle rising out of the Arabic-script word
''Allah'' or God -- were everywhere, alongside pictures of their
''martyrs'' -- those who died fighting the Israelis and the SLA.
</P>
<P>
   Other portraits were of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme
leader of Iran, the country that inspired and funded the creation
of Lebanon's Shiite guerrilla movement. There were also pictures of
Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's chief.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Nasrallah was sending a message of brotherly love to
Christian civilians in south Lebanon -- in sharp contrast to his
vows only nine days ago to wreak bloody vengeance on SLA militiamen
regardless of their religious affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news conference in Beirut, he sought to reassure
the Christians living in isolated pockets among Shiite villagers in
the western part of the zone patrolled until two days ago by
Israelis and the SLA. ''You are our sons, our hearts and our eyes.
We will be your parents and your protectors,'' Nasrallah said.
</P>
<P>
   With SLA men surrendering or fleeing by the hundreds, there was
little need to repeat his more bellicose tone of May 14. Then, his
message to the Israeli-allied militia was this: ''By God, we will
enter your homes and slaughter you in your beds.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, when Hezbollah opened fire on Monday and Tuesday, it
was at Israeli positions along the border.
</P>
<P>
   In its earlier years, Hezbollah spoke of carrying its Islamic
holy war to Jerusalem. Such rhetoric is seldom heard these days,
with Hezbollah concentrating on expanding its political power at
home -- where it now holds seven seats in the 128-member Lebanese
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah is thought to have fewer than 500 active fighters --
but it has a reservoir of thousands of armed supporters.
</P>
<P>
   In moving quickly into villages only a few miles from the
Israeli border, Hezbollah took advantage of a power vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon has had a mandate
since 1978 to serve as a buffer -- all the way up to the border --
but the peacekeeping force had been prevented since its inception
from getting there because of the Israeli army and the presence of
the SLA and its precursor, another Christian-led militia called the
Army of Free Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is now waiting to verify that Israel and the
SLA has completely withdrawn before it sends troops to southern
Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Three Republican candidates for Senate face off on New York radio  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Three of the four Republican candidates for
U.S. Senate vigorously attacked President Clinton during a debate
on a New York radio station Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   They also took no-tax pledges, opposed same-sex marriage and
set-asides for minority businesses, and promised to support a law
requiring the recitation in public school classes of the ''all men
are created equal'' phrase from the Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Bob Franks, R-Berkeley Heights, defended his vote to
impeach Clinton and, after initial hesitation, told WABC-AM radio
host Sean Hannity that Clinton should be indicted when he leaves
office.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bill Clinton flaunted the law, and he ought to be held
accountable,'' Franks said. ''As a prosecutor I would seek to
indict him, but that is not my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Essex County executive Jim Treffinger, a one-time Democrat,
heartily agreed, saying Arkansas officials should move against him
immediately. Ramapo College professor Murray Sabrin said he would
have rented the truck to move Clinton out of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bill Clinton should have resigned. Because he has no shame, he
is still in the White House,'' Sabrin said, adding that vice
president Al Gore, the Democratic nominee for president, was even
more corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   An Arkansas legal ethics committee Monday recommended to that
state's Supreme Court that Clinton face proceedings to be disbarred
as an attorney in that state.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth candidate, state Sen. William Gormley, R-Atlantic,
did not participate in the debate. Campaign manager David Murray
said Gormley had agreed to an earlier radio date, but had
previously scheduled a meeting with newspaper editors and campaign
events in Ocean County.
</P>
<P>
   Treffinger and Sabrin were in the studio with Hannity, and
Franks participated by phone from Washington, where Congress was in
session. After one hour, Franks left and Treffinger and Sabrin
spent a second hour tearing at each other. Treffinger denounced
Sabrin's conservative credentials and Sabrin in defense screamed at
his opponent on the air.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not since my kids left puberty have I heard such an
outburst,'' Treffinger replied, giggling. Hannity did little to
interrupt the outbursts.
</P>
<P>
   Sabrin ran for governor in 1997 as a Libertarian, and in keeping
with that party's platform he had opposed central government laws
against drug use, prostitution and other so-called victimless
crimes. The three veteran Republicans have politely dismissed
Sabrin's entry in the GOP primary, but Tuesday Treffinger attacked
him directly for these past pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
   ''Murray, you can't run away from the things you said. You can't
run away from everything the newspapers said,'' Treffinger said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Sabrin -- a German immigrant and son of Jewish
Holocaust survivors -- likened Treffinger's ''distortions'' to Nazi
propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. ''It is called Slick Jimmy,''
Sabrin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is called the truth,'' Treffinger replied.
</P>
<P>
   Franks stayed out of the Sabrin fray, saying he was happy to
have Sabrin in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Sabrin hung with the Libertarian platform Tuesday only by
promising to repeal all gun laws, saying people should be allowed
to carry concealed handguns if they want to -- just as Treffinger is
permitted to do.
</P>
<P>
   Treffinger said he got a carry permit from a judge following
death threats when he first took office in Essex County. He said
any citizen can file for these permits, provided they have a good
reason. Franks did not comment on the issue Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On issues such as the repeal of federal and state laws against
drug use and prostitution, Sabrin distanced himself from his 1997
positions, saying he had never said such things.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have never said we should legalize drugs. All I have said is
that this is a health problem, not a crime problem,'' Sabrin said.
</P>
<P>
   Even callers to the radio program disputed his recollection of
his own campaign statements in 1997 regarding drugs and
prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   Treffinger, for his part, said federal law should prohibit
prostitution, and that Nevada should be deprived of its right to
legalize it. ''I think our nation is in a moral crisis,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Pressure Builds on Fujimori  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- With five days left before Sunday's
presidential runoff, pressure built Tuesday on incumbent Alberto
Fujimori to postpone the vote or face political turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's national election watchdog group, Transparencia, said it
would ''abstain from observing Sunday's election.'' The move came
one day after the Organization of American States' monitoring
mission announced that it was suspending cooperation with election
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not exclusively a problem with the date, but rather for
us, that there does not exist the minimum technical conditions to
provide electoral competition,'' said Transparencia spokeswoman
Cecilia Blondet.
</P>
<P>
   Transparencia's independent poll count provided a benchmark for
foreign governments and local politicians to insist on a runoff
vote to clear the air of fraud allegations in the first round April
9.
</P>
<P>
   Official results showed Fujimori falling just shy of the
majority necessary to avoid a runoff with challenger Alejandro
Toledo, whose supporters maintain that street protests and
international pressure were the only things that prevented Fujimori
from claiming a fraudulent victory.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department has fully backed Transparencia and the
OAS mission, and President Clinton signed a resolution last month
warning Fujimori that Peru could face diplomatic and economic
sanctions if election irregularities persisted.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington on Tuesday, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
said the United States would continue working with the OAS to
ensure fair elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is important to our bilateral relations, that we have
free and fair elections,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Transparencia, which receives large-scale funding from foreign
governments, including the United States, Canada and Germany, had
been prepared to send 20,000 volunteers to voting sites across the
country to conduct another ''quick count'' of ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, who last week announced he was boycotting Sunday's vote
to force a postponement, said Tuesday that he would begin telling
his supporters to spoil their ballots with the words ''no to
fraud.'' He had been asking Peruvians not to go to the polls in
defiance of a law that makes voting obligatory.
</P>
<P>
   But Toledo said he was changing the strategy because of an
aggressive ad campaign by election authorities warning that
absenteeism would be punished by stiff penalties, on top of a $33
fine. The minimum wage in Peru is less about $120 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The ad campaign reminded Peruvians that anyone who failed to
vote would be unable to obtain public medical insurance or social
security of any kind and be ineligible to receive a driver's
license or passport.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the OAS monitoring mission announced it was
''temporarily suspending cooperation'' with Peruvian election
officials, accusing them of trying to use its presence to endorse a
flawed ballot-counting system.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Stein, head of the mission, said his observers had found
grave flaws in the vote-counting software.
</P>
<P>
   Stein went behind closed doors with ambassadors from 11 of the
OAS' 35 member nations Tuesday and was expected to issue a new
statement about his mission's position on the vote.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Take Over Israeli Zone  </HEADLINE>
By ZEINA KARAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   BINT JBEIL, Lebanon (AP) -- Jubilant Shiite Muslim guerrillas
stepped swiftly into the power vacuum left Tuesday by
Israeli-allied militiamen who surrendered or fled southern Lebanon,
abandoning tanks and weapons as Israel moved to end two decades of
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Homeward-bound Israeli soldiers honked jeep horns and kissed the
ground after crossing the frontier into Israel, where hundreds of
panicky militiamen and their families converged in search of
asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Israel had set July 7 as the deadline for its withdrawal, but
the collapse of its militia allies speeded up the army's exit from
the security zone, created in 1985 to protect Israel's northern
settlements from cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   A complete withdrawal was expected within days. But with some of
the remaining Israeli outposts located in the north of the security
zone, the army's main concern was keeping roads clear and getting
its soldiers out safely.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the retreat, fighting continued. Israel sent Merkava
battle tanks to protect its retreating troops. Israeli air force
jets rocketed guerrilla positions and destroyed uneeded roads into
its old enclave. By Tuesday night, the Israeli army had abandoned
several front-line positions and pulled armor and artillery from
the area of Marjayoun, the town that served as the enclave's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   The army also abandoned Bint Jbeil, Israel's second-largest base
in Lebanon, and crowds of Lebanese guerrillas and sympathizers
surged in to reclaim the village of 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Fighters and civilians alike waved the flags of the main Shiite
guerrilla groups -- Hezbollah and Amal. Some carried pictures of
Hezbollah chief Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, and others shouted ''God
protect him.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an unforgettable moment,'' said Hala Ayoub, 55,
squeezing her 18-year-old son whom she saw only once a year outside
the zone. Many young Lebanese stayed away from the zone for fear of
being forcibly recruited into the Israeli-allied South Lebanon
Army.
</P>
<P>
   The scene of celebration was repeated in dozens of villages,
where hundreds of SLA militiamen surrendered or fled with families
to Israel, giving the guerrillas unimpeded access to the border. In
the east, militiamen abandoned the notorious Khiam prison, leaving
140 inmates to walk free.
</P>
<P>
   In Chihin, 100-year-old Hamdiyyah al-Meri joined dancers,
stomping her feet with the aid of a cane. ''Nothing can stop me
now,'' said al-Meri, a smile exposing her missing teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Tuffaha Hmoud looked on smiling and said: ''This is the happiest
moment of my life.'' Hmoud, 48, was reunited with her son, Ali, who
had been living with six siblings outside the village to avoid the
SLA.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, border residents took to their bomb shelters Tuesday,
fearing possible reprisal attacks.
</P>
<P>
   At Fatima Gate, an inland border crossing into Israel, hundreds
of militiamen and their families left cars backed up for miles and
finished the journey on foot, carrying suitcases crammed with their
belongings. Several hundred more fled through the Naqoura border
post on the Mediterranean coast.
</P>
<P>
   Among those heading to Israel were the widow and six daughters
of the late Maj. Saad Haddad, the first Lebanese military man to
publicly ally himself with Israel. Haddad, a renegade from the
Lebanese army in the opening years of the 1975-90 civil war,
founded the Army of Free Lebanon, forerunner of the South Lebanon
Army.
</P>
<P>
   Just before sundown, the stream of refugees came to a standstill
when gunmen opened fire on Israeli troops from a high-rise building
in Kfar Kila. Refugees ducked behind parked cars. At one point
about a dozen sprinted toward the Israeli side as bullets flew
above.
</P>
<P>
   Two Israeli soldiers crouching behind a car at the gate fired
long volleys back at a Lebanese sniper's nest in the unfinished
high-rise.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, about 3,000 Lebanese refugees had entered Israel,
most taking refuge in a tent camp on the northern shore of the Sea
of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday six civilians were killed and 19 wounded when Israeli
and allied militia gunners opened fire in an attempt to halt the
masses streaming back to their hometowns.
</P>
<P>
   A Lebanese driver working with the British Broadcasting Corp.
was killed Tuesday when a shell landed beside his car near the
border, BBC Middle East correspondent Jeremy Bowen said. It was
unclear who fired the shell.
</P>
<P>
   Another Lebanese civilian lost a leg when he drove his
motorcycle over a land mine outside an abandoned militia position
in the village of Baraachit.
</P>
<P>
   The hundreds of SLA militiamen who surrendered Tuesday were
hauled away in Lebanese army trucks. They were expected to stand
trial on charges of collaboration that carry prison terms or even
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a beautiful scene to see the collaborators rounded up in
humiliation,'' said Nasser Fakhreddine, a 33-year-old truck driver.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, some SLA members ''have been my neighbors for 20
years, and they were forcefully drafted. I hope the government
takes this into consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   At Khiam prison, a forbidding hillside complex near Marjayoun,
residents broke the locks and freed its 140 prisoners, many held
for as long as 10 years without trial. Most had been accused of
attacking the SLA, aiding the guerrillas or refusing to join the
militia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tell my family I'm coming home,'' said inmate Mohammed Seyyed.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups have long denounced conditions at the
prison, saying inmates were routinely tortured. Israel denied
involvement in running the prison, but last year acknowledged it
had trained Khiam's interrogators.

<HEADLINE> Cousin of Rutgers' youngest graduate earns degree at age 15  </HEADLINE>
By NINA RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The cousin of Rutgers University's youngest
graduate is upholding an unusual family tradition -- he earned a
college degree at age 15.
</P>
<P>
   Shant Sarkuni, of Cranbury, graduated from Rutgers University
with bachelor's degrees in math and computer sciences on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   His cousin, Hannes Sarkuni, became the university's youngest
graduate at age 14 when he graduated in 1996. Hannes' brother,
Sehrope, graduated last May at age 15. All three boys received
highest honors and majored in math and science.
</P>
<P>
   Shant enrolled in the university at 11, after completing seventh
grade at Cranbury Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   To him, skipping high school didn't seem unusual. ''I saw my
cousins every day. They would tell me about college and going to
the student center. It seemed pretty normal,'' Shant said.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't exactly have the same college experience as
traditional students.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he lived on campus, Shant replied: ''My mom
wouldn't let me.''
</P>
<P>
   Shant's father, Movses Sarkuni, said he didn't allow his son to
attend any college parties where there was liquor or go on Spring
Break.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't send him to Cancun alone with the other college
kids,'' said Movses Sarkuni, who emigrated from Lebanon in 1969.
Instead, he took the whole family on a vacation to Saint Thomas two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's mother, Sevan Sarkuni, said she did not push her son
to excel, nor will she encourage her two younger children to skip a
few grades.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's up to them,'' she said. ''I encouraged (Shant) to study.
But his cousins were examples. He just saw what he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is very natural,'' said Sarko Sarkuni, Movses's brother
and the father of Hannes and Sehrope. ''The kids say a lot of kids
can do it, as magical as it seems.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarko Sarkuni, a computer programmer, said ''children have a
tremendous ability to learn if given the opportunity. Ours were
very fortunate to have this opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Movses Sarkuni, a retired office building developer, drove Shant
back and forth to campus. He got help from his brother and nephew
Hannes, when he was old enough to drive.
</P>
<P>
   Hannes, now 18, said he was very proud of his cousin.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was with him every step of the way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hannes, like the rest of the family, shrugged off the notion
that their accomplishments are a mark of genius. ''Anyone can do
it. You gotta give kids the opportunity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shant said he is eager to enter the working world, and has no
immediate plans to enroll in graduate school. He began working last
year as a computer programmer for MetaPrime Corp., the
Cranbury-based software development firm founded by Hannes.
</P>
<P>
   Shant, however, cannot work full-time yet because that would be
a violation of child labor laws, he said.

<HEADLINE> China Drops Ban on U.S. Tobacco  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- China dropped an 11-year-old ban on the
importation of American tobacco Tuesday on the eve of the House
vote on whether to grant the Chinese permanent normal trade
relations.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the U.S. trade representative announcing the end
of the ban, Chinese Ambassador Li Zhaoxing said ''such good news
will be conducive to the PNTR legislation in (the) U.S. Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   China had claimed that a fungus on U.S. tobacco called blue mold
could damage its domestic crop but had recently suspended research
on the issue after scientists concluded that the fungus could not
reproduce once the leaf is cured.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the trade agreement have said that an end to the
Chinese ban could increase U.S. tobacco exports by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement that the Clinton administration negotiated
last year, China is to drop its tariff on U.S. tobacco from 40
percent to 10 percent and on cigarettes from 65 percent to 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Several North Carolina lawmakers who represent large
tobacco-growing regions have been undecided on the China trade
vote. The end of the tobacco ban cemented a ''yes'' vote from Rep.
Bob Etheridge, D-N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ''With this development there ain't no question,'' said
spokesman Brad Woodhouse.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Fighting Rages in Nigeria  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK AIGBOGUN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) -- Christians and Muslims clashed for a
second day Tuesday in the northern city of Kaduna, burning homes
and places of worship. Officials said the death toll climbed to 100
despite a heavy presence by security forces.
</P>
<P>
   After the second day of fighting in Kaduna, hundreds of
residents fled south, carrying their belongings in bundles on their
heads. Others took refuge in police and army barracks as homes and
places of worship were torched and went up in smoke, witnesses
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaduna State Governor Ahmed Mohammed Makarfi imposed an 8 p.m.
to 8 a.m. curfew in a bid to contain the violence, and an uneasy
calm returned to the city shortly before the curfew took effect.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting was a revival of bitter religious bloodletting
touched off in Kaduna in February by plans to implement Islamic
law, or sharia, in some northern states. Up to 2,000 died in the
earlier fighting, many of them in Kaduna.
</P>
<P>
   The clashes broke out Monday after some residents in a
predominantly Christian neighborhood blamed Muslims for an earlier
killing of a local man, police commissioner Mohammed Shehu said.
Armed with clubs, stones and machetes, they attacked and burned
homes of Muslims, who quickly launched reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the fighting spread to other areas. Hospital and
police officials said late Tuesday that the death toll had climbed
to 100.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 people have been arrested in connection with the
fighting, human rights activist Shehu Sani told Lagos radio.
</P>
<P>
   New courts have been created under the sharia law with the power
to try criminal cases involving Muslims and mete out punishments.
Sharia supporters have said the laws would only apply to Muslims,
but the change angered and frightened Christians here.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting in February was also linked to Nigeria's web of
ethnic disputes and the north's waning power.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Backs Israeli Withdrawal  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration and American Jewish
leaders expressed support Tuesday for Israel's withdrawal from
southern Lebanon as the Jewish state's 24-year-old security zone in
Lebanon began collapsing six weeks early.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of an influential pro-Israel organization urged strong
U.S. diplomatic efforts to guarantee Israel's security, while
members of the group said in interviews they expect no U.S. troop
commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Israel had set July 7 as deadline for its withdrawal, but more
than two decades of occupation were ending sooner as pro-Israeli
Lebanese militia suddenly surrendered or fled in large numbers,
triggering a quick departure by Israeli soldiers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration said it was backing the United
Nations in trying to ensure an orderly retreat of Israeli troops
from southern Lebanon. As Israel's withdrawal accelerated and
turned chaotic, Hezbollah guerrillas quickly moved in to take
power.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would like to see the whole process be as calm as
possible,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said after making
urgent telephone calls to Arab and Israeli leaders to urge
restraint.
</P>
<P>
   She also talked with French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine and
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan about Lebanon and declared
support for United Nations help in quickly establishing the
Lebanese government's effective authority over the territory.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have said they would not offer U.S. troops, after
Annan recommended increasing the current U.N. peacekeeping force of
some 4,500 to 5,600 and later to 7,900. American Jewish leaders
said they expect Albright to urge allies to commit more
peacekeepers. The force is intended to confirm an orderly
withdrawal of Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Israel is doing what the U.N. asked it to do,'' said Jerry
Yanowitz, a Jewish community leader from Oakland, Calif. ''Now, the
U.S. and the international community has to see that the border is
secure.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Kohr, head of the American Israeli Public Affairs
Committee, urged members at their annual meeting to lobby Congress
to pass a resolution that would commend Israel for withdrawing,
call for an end to violence and emphatically declare Israel's right
to defend itself. The resolution has the support of House and
Senate leadership in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ''The focus now has to be on Hezbollah and their sponsors, Syria
and Iran,'' Kohr said. ''The United States and Israel's other
allies have to hold them accountable'' for ensuring peace.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Irving Greenberg, incoming chairman of the U.S. Holocaust
Memorial Museum, said at AIPAC's closing session that Jewish
Americans have a sense of ''anxiety and concern'' for Israel. He
said the country's leaders are ''wrestling with the risks of
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   He urged the nation to commit to ''never being so pressured that
it will risk its life ... and never so self-centered that it will
crush others.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier at the AIPAC meeting, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
said in an address by satellite that he would hold Syria and
Lebanon accountable if the troop withdrawal was marked by violence.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Jacobsen, assistant national director of the Anti-Defamation
League in New York City, said Israel is taking a ''very serious
risk and making decisions that are full of consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What we would like to see from our own government is a
forceful stand to make clear that any attacks against Israel,
whether from Hezbollah or from support for such attacks by Syria or
Iran, will be strongly condemned and opposed,'' Jacobsen said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   He said all Americans must recognize Israel's ''fundamental
right to protect its own citizens if it is attacked'' once the
security zone in Lebanon is lost.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. commitment to supply arms to Israel must continue,
Jacobsen said, but Israel is not expected to ask for any military
commitment beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's up to Syria,'' he said, referring to Syria's control over
Lebanon. ''This will expose whether Syria really is interested in
peace or is using violence as pressure on Israel.''

<HEADLINE> Florio confident despite latest Corzine ad blitz  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- After appearing before a friendly group of
senior citizens bused in for the occasion, former Gov. Jim Florio
said Tuesday he can win the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate,
despite his opponent's latest multimillion dollar advertising
blitz.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic rival Jon Corzine will spend at least $2 million for
network television time this week, with two weeks to go before the
Democratic primary election, a campaign spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine began airing three new network television ads Tuesday,
all attacking Florio for his position on Social Security and for
raising state taxes while governor.
</P>
<P>
   That shows Corzine knows he can lose, Florio said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that Jon Corzine believes this is a winnable race
for either one of us,'' Florio said.
</P>
<P>
   The former governor claimed to have poll data showing him nearly
even with Corzine.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's 50-50. He's got polls. I've got polls. Everybody is in
the mid range,'' Florio said. ''I am confident that this is a race
that is going to be winnable, despite his money.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio began the day in Hoboken and had an event scheduled for
the evening in Vineland.
</P>
<P>
   Midday he stopped in Trenton to speak before a crowd of 150
elderly volunteers the campaign brought to the capital's Masonic
Temple. Florio's topic: Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The former governor now says the election's central issue is
whether to invest portions of Social Security funds in private
markets.
</P>
<P>
   This comes a week after a newspaper disclosed a tape recording
of a 1999 interview in which Florio explicitly supported the idea
of investing Social Security funds in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Florio said repeatedly Tuesday he ''misspoke.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't even remember what the context was,'' Florio said.
</P>
<P>
   His record during the campaign and for his entire public career
shows that he does not support private investment of the public
Social Security funds, Florio said.
</P>
<P>
   His audience booed Corzine's plan and cheered Florio at each
turn when he promised to save the system. At one point Florio said
he was sure some in the audience recalled the days before Franklin
D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've heard me for 30 years talking about how Social
Security is something almost religiously sacred,'' Florio said
later.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine spokesman Steven Goldstein said their ads highlight
Florio's ''lies and flip-flops'' on Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jon Corzine's only spending $1 for every one of Jim Florio's
lies,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Florio has yet to run a television ad. He said Tuesday he will
run some television spots, but he did not say when.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is still considering proposals on buying time,
Florio said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Hastert OK Renewal Deal  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and the top House
Republican, setting aside partisan differences, jointly announced
Tuesday a multibillion-dollar package of tax breaks and other
benefits to attract investment and jobs to poor areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''We actually believe -- we may be wrong but we actually believe
-- that we can bring the benefits of free enterprise to poor
people,'' Clinton said as House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.,
stood smiling beside him.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and Republicans led by Hastert agreed Monday
night to blend competing plans for boosting the economic status of
places that have not enjoyed America's current boom.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, Clinton and Hastert shook hands and hailed a
new spirit of cooperation at a made-for-the-cameras White House
gathering of Republicans and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last year, the leaders you see here today could have said,
'We've got an idea, they've got an idea, let's have a fight,'''
Clinton said to laughter. ''But instead, thank goodness, they took
a different course, and it led us to common ground, and I would
argue, higher ground.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can put our ideas together and the best ideas together,
I think we can create a better America,'' Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are expected to bring the legislation to the House
floor next month. Passage is expected, although the prospects are
somewhat less clear in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The White House ceremony produced a remarkable show of unity.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., a conservative and the only black
Republican in the House, stood near Rep. Charles Rangel of New
York, a liberal and an elder in the Congressional Black Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Both men were involved in efforts to craft the compromise,
although each mentioned a different aspect of it.
</P>
<P>
   Watts cited Clinton's agreement to ''the inclusion of
faith-based organizations in the solution to addressing poverty,''
as well as White House acceptance of zero capital gains for some
invesmtnets in distressed areas.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel cited a provision for an expansion of the low income
house tax credit, a provision he said ''will help create 180,000
homes over the next five years.''
</P>
<P>
   White House economic adviser Gene Sperling estimated the program
would cost $5 billion to $7 billion over five years, but would
leverage that much or more in new investment and economic power.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has made several trips to inner cities, Indian
reservations and patches of rural America to promote his economic
growth ideas for what he calls ''new markets'' at home. Clinton's
plan features tax credits, loan guarantees and other inducements
for businesses to invest in these places.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert has championed a plan with similar aims. In 40 proposed
''renewal communities,'' tax credits and other lures to new
investment are coupled with a capital gains tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   An existing program of empowerment zones, also designed to help
economically distressed areas, would be expanded under the
bipartisan program.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters expect the House to vote on the new package this
year. There is no similar unified package before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert insisted on a new provision to make churches and other
religious organizations eligible for federal grants to run
substance abuse programs. This provision would apply throughout the
nation, regardless of whether the program serves a poor region.
</P>
<P>
   Both the White House and Hastert said the change is carefully
worded to avoid constitutional challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were clearly concerned with those issues,'' Sperling said.
In the end, the White House agreed to a formula that places
religious groups on equal footing with other nonprofit
organizations doing similar work, Sperling said.

<HEADLINE> House Panel: Cut Clinton Spending  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House panel voted Tuesday to provide less
money than President Clinton wants for housing, space, community
service and environmental programs, setting up another possible
veto fight with President Clinton over spending.
</P>
<P>
   The $101 billion measure, one of the largest of the 13 annual
spending bills, was approved by voice vote by a subcommittee of the
House Appropriations Committee. The Senate has yet to write its own
version of the measure, which is for the fiscal year starting next
Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Subcommittee Chairman James Walsh, R-N.Y., said some of the cuts
would be eased before the bill is enacted. These included its
elimination of the Americorps national service program, a Clinton
initiative that Republicans try annually to cut, and its omission
of any projects for lawmakers' home districts. Last year, such
projects totaled about $800 million, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just the first of many steps we will take in moving
this bill forward,'' Walsh said, adding later, ''The bill will have
to have Americorps money in it to be signed by the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Rep. Alan Mollohan of West Virginia, top Democrat on
the subcommittee, said the measure held spending for needed
programs ''hostage of outdated deficit politics.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, the committee's senior
Democrat, predicted that Clinton would not sign it, saying, ''It
does nothing to meet the challenges this bill is supposed to
meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the bill would provide $8 billion more than this year
but $8 billion less than Clinton wants.
</P>
<P>
   Spending would increase over this year's levels for veterans'
health care, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, clean
water funds for states, NASA and the National Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   But besides eliminating the $353 million Americorps, the bill
would reduce Clinton's requests for Environmental Protection Agency
operations by $200 million, or 10 percent; for assistance to
low-income renters by $800 million, or 6 percent; and for aid to
the homeless by $180 million, or 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It would also ignore Clinton's request for a new $300 million
NASA effort to study new space vehicles. House Majority Whip Tom
DeLay, R-Texas, inserted language saying the House might provide
money for the program if any is available.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would also impose a one-year delay on the
Environmental Protection Agency from issuing rules limiting
pollution entering streams from farms and other runoff, in effect
leaving the issue up to the next administration. The provision,
proposed by members of both parties, is opposed by the White House.

<HEADLINE> Close Call With Air Force Planes  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two jets from the Air Force's showcase
aerobatics team, the Thunderbirds, veered off course after an air
show and flew near a passenger jet and a small private plane, Air
Force officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the Thunderbirds violateed Federal Aviation
Administration airspace rules Monday near Washington's Dulles
International Airport. They described incident as inadvertent.
</P>
<P>
   The team of F-16 fighter aircraft had taken off from Andrews Air
Force Base, Md., after performing in an air show and were returning
home to Nellis Air Force Base, Nev., when the incident occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman William Shumann said
two F-16s from an eight-plane formation came within 100 feet
vertically and 1.83 miles horizontally of a single-engine,
four-seat private plane near Dulles. FAA regulations require
minimum spacing of 1,000 feet vertically or three miles
horizontally.
</P>
<P>
   The two Thunderbirds also were within 700 feet vertically and
0.9 of a mile horizontally of an American Airlines MD-80 jetliner
in the same area, Shumann said.
</P>
<P>
   Before approaching Dulles, the same two F-16s apparently flew in
prohibited airspace over the U.S. Naval Observatory, the official
residence of the vice president, Shumann said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA spokesman said another F-16 from the same formation also
was off course. He reported his position at an altitude of 3,000
feet, 25 miles west of Andrews, and was told by FAA controllers to
climb to 6,000 feet in order to avoid hitting a 3,500-foot mountain
in the Blue Ridge Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Shumann said it was up to the Air Force to decide whether any
disciplinary action is taken against the pilots. If they had been
civilians, the punishment could have ranged from letters of
reprimand to lifetime suspension of their pilots licenses, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem began when one Thunderbird pilot became slightly
disoriented shortly after takeoff from Andrews in heavy cloud
cover, Air Force spokesman Maj. Jon Anderson said. The pilot
dropped out of the formation for safety reasons, and ''that threw a
few people off'' in the rest of the formation, Anderson said. The
jets split up and then reformed with the help of FAA radar tracking
west of the Dulles airport.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said it was not clear whether the Thunderbird pilots
realized they had come closer to the two civilian planes than
allowed by FAA regulations. Anderson had no other details.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines spokesman John Hotard said an air traffic
controller at Dulles noticed the Thunderbirds coming into Dulles
airspace and ordered American Flight 1604 from Dallas to climb 700
feet and make a right turn.
</P>
<P>
   Hotard said the maneuver was so gentle that passengers and
flight attendants never noticed. The captain of the American flight
saw the nearest fighter jet but decided there was no problem to
report, Hotard said.

<HEADLINE> Independent mailings raise suspicions in Republican primary race  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A leader of a new, largely anonymous and
politically conservative political committee denies having a
favorite candidate in the Republican primary in New Jersey's 7th
district.
</P>
<P>
   But skeptics point out that the group's hard-hitting fliers have
mentioned only three of the four Republican candidates, raising
suspicions they are designed to help the fourth candidate, Mike
Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson denies any link and has called on the group to stop
distributing ''negative'' campaign material. But two weeks before
the June 6 primary, the fliers have galvanized and united
Ferguson's three challengers -- Tom Kean Jr., Patrick Morrisey and
Joel Weingarten.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is why people are so turned off by politics today,'' Kean
said.
</P>
<P>
   The group in question, the Council for Responsible Government,
registered under section 527 of the income tax code, an
increasingly popular home for groups looking to influence
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Such groups can raise as much money as they want, anonymously,
and spend it on ads that do not explicitly call for the election or
defeat of a specific candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Wilson, a conservative consultant in Virginia, said he runs
the group's board along with Gary Glenn, head of a family-values
group in Michigan, and William Hillman, the owner of a construction
company in suburban Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said the council's 45 members share a political agenda of
''free-market economics, traditional cultural values and a desire
for strong accountability by elected officials.'' He would not
identify the members.
</P>
<P>
   The group incorporated in Virginia on May 2. New Jersey is its
second battleground; it also spent an estimated $100,000 on
television ads criticizing Idaho Lt. Gov. Butch Otter, a candidate
for House. Otter's opponent, Dennis Mansfield, is a founder of the
conservative Idaho Family Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said the group hopes to raise and spend $3 million this
year in primary and general campaigns. Without offering specifics,
he said the group may be active in upcoming primaries in Kansas,
Washington and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, one of the group's fliers assailed Weingarten, a
state assemblyman, as ''a tax and spend-borrow and spend
politician.'' A second flier criticized Kean for living in
Massachusetts and Washington before returning to New Jersey, where
he was raised.
</P>
<P>
   That second flier included a line praising Morrisey: ''Pat
Morrisey has experience dealing with important issues.'' Morrisey
insists the line suggests, incorrectly, that he is responsible for
the flier.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've gotten a tremendous amount of calls from people saying,
'Pat, how can you do this?''' Morrisey said.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing last weekend at a community forum, Kean, Morrisey and
Weingarten made a pledge not to support any candidate found to be
linked to the group's mailings. The pledge seemed targeted at
Ferguson, who was not present. Ferguson's campaign manager, Dan
Quinonez, said Tuesday that Ferguson has not seen the pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Quinonez emphatically denied that the Ferguson campaign had any
knowledge of, or link to, the Council for Responsible Government.
Ferguson has denounced the group and called on it to stop sending
''anonymous and negative'' mailings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were never approached or told about'' the mailings,
Quinonez said. ''We want them to stop the negative mailing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson benefited from a similar situation in his unsuccessful
1998 challenge to Rep. Frank Pallone, D-Long Branch. In that race,
a group called Americans for Job Security bought $1.8 million worth
of television ads urging voters to make sure Pallone kept ''his
hands off Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Morrisey, ''I think that it's very coincidental that every
time Mike Ferguson is in a campaign, there's a third-party
expenditure launched that boosts him up.''
</P>
<P>
   Some supporters of the targeted candidates in New Jersey suspect
that the group is most interested in hurting Republicans who don't
oppose abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Weingarten and Kean, the two candidates directly targeted by the
fliers, support abortion rights. Ferguson, the only candidate the
group has left alone, opposes abortion and has been endorsed by the
state and national chapters of Right to Life.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the group's law firm, Bopp Coleson &AMP; Bostrom, represents
National Right to Life.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said the group's mission to protect ''traditional
cultural values'' does involve opposing abortion. But he denied
that is the group's driving interest, and he said the council chose
Bopp, Coleson &AMP; Bostrom because of the firm's experience with
election law.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was unaware of the firm's affiliation with Right to
Life, but now that he knows, ''I feel better about (retaining the
firm) than I did before.''

<HEADLINE> Lloyd's Won't Seek Swissair Jewels  </HEADLINE>
By SUE LEEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Lloyd's of London canceled its plans Tuesday to
search the site of the 1998 Swissair crash off Canada for $200
million worth of diamonds and jewels, saying it was sorry ''for any
distress'' it caused crash victims' families by initially pursuing
a search.
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, Lloyd's spokesman Adrian Beeby denied that the
insurance company was being insensitive by seeking to retrieve the
valuables from the wreckage of the crash, which killed 229 people.
He said the site already had been dredged by Canadian authorities
immediately after the plane went down.
</P>
<P>
   But Lloyd's later said in a statement that the license it
applied for to search the site, if issued, would be used solely to
deter treasure hunters.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reputation of Lloyd's has always been founded on its
integrity,'' the statement said. ''Consequently, Lloyd's will not
dive or explore the site, respecting the wishes of the families.
Lloyd's would like to apologize to all of the families of the
victims of the Swissair crash for any distress caused by its
application for a license.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators still have not discovered what caused Swissair
Flight 111 to crash into the ocean just off Nova Scotia on Sept. 2,
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Through a Canadian insurance company, Lloyd's had asked the Nova
Scotia government for permission to hunt for 4{ pounds of diamonds
and 11 pounds of jewelry listed on the flight manifest.
</P>
<P>
   The diamonds reportedly were in a stainless steel tube, which
may have disintegrated on impact or been driven deep into the
seabed.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd's had said it planned to start hunting this summer, using
a mini-submarine to seek the gems among the wreckage, which lies in
about 200 feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   Swissair spokesman Jean-Claude Donzel had said the airline was
not involved in the salvage issue, calling it ''something between
the rescue and investigation team and Nova Scotia.''
</P>
<P>
   Ian Shaw, whose daughter died in the crash, argued before the
Nova Scotia legislature Friday that no one should be allowed to
''rake through'' the site. He said other victims' relatives also
opposed the plan.
</P>
<P>
   He later called the company's change of heart a ''ray of
sunshine''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Estabrooks, a member of the Nova Scotia legislature who
represents communities near the crash site, had said the province
should reject any treasure trove application ''because of the
sacredness of the site.''

<HEADLINE> Swiss Makes Holocaust Apology  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERN, Switzerland (AP) -- The Swiss government apologized to a
Jewish brother and sister Tuesday for having expelled them with
their parents during the Holocaust, and agreed to pay them $118,000
in an out-of-court settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Sonabend, whose parents later perished at the Auschwitz
death camp in Poland, said the meeting with Finance Minister Kaspar
Villiger and Interior Minister Ruth Dreifuss was comforting.
</P>
<P>
   ''My sister and I never understood in all those years what took
place against innocent people,'' Sonabend told reporters. ''It's
comforting to note that, on the part of the thinking Swiss, they
too can't understand why it all took place.''
</P>
<P>
   The $118,000, which the Finance Ministry will pay to Charles and
Sabine Sonabend, is an out-of-court settlement to cover costs
incurred during their legal battle.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Supreme Court awarded plaintiff Joseph Spring
$59,000 to cover his legal costs. Many other Holocaust survivors
sought redress through a $1.25 billion class-action settlement
reached with two Swiss banks in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Sonabend said he filed the lawsuit because he thought
media attention was the only way to get through to today's young
about what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Villiger said he and Dreifuss had felt a need to meet with the
Sonabends, ''people who were affected by our refugee policy,'' and
to listen to their questions, some of which had no answers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course suffering cannot be soothed or forgotten in this
way,'' he said. ''Mistakes also cannot be corrected. But such a
meeting can help us to understand, and never to forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by Germany, Nazi-occupied France and Nazi-allied
Italy during World War II, neutral Switzerland took in nearly
30,000 Jews. But, fearing it would be swamped by refugees or
provoke Germany's ire, it repelled an equal number to face almost
certain death.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Sonabend -- a watch retailer in Belgium -- had taken his
family to Switzerland in August 1942, hoping to escape the Nazis.
But the family arrived just as Switzerland began rejecting all
Jewish refugees. When they tried to register, they were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The parents were sent to Auschwitz and almost immediately
gassed. The children were smuggled by a Jewish group to Paris,
where they remained for the rest of the war in hiding.
</P>
<P>
   Charles said the Swiss officials at the time ''were criminals,
knowing full well what they were doing when they deported innocent
Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said it was historic that any government ''apologized for
what had taken place 60 years earlier, not what they had done, but
for what their grandparents had done.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles now lives in London, and his sister lives in Brussels.

<HEADLINE> Opponents outnumber supporters of free trade with China  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House and its pro-trade allies will
get little support from New Jersey Thursday when the House finally
votes on whether to grant permanent normal trade relations to
China.
</P>
<P>
   Of 13 representatives from New Jersey, only three plan to vote
for normalized trade relations. The three, all Republicans, say the
plan is good for the U.S. economy and will encourage democracy in
China.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the trade deal cite concerns over human rights and
environmental abuses in China and question what happens to U.S.
workers whose jobs would move to China under a free-trade
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   A summary of positions of the 13 House members, gleaned from
public comments:
</P>
<P>
   Rob Andrews, D-Haddon Heights:
</P>
<P>
   Opposes trade deal. Says too many American workers will be hurt
by the movement of jobs to China.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Franks, R-Berkeley Heights:
</P>
<P>
   Supports trade deal as good for New Jersey's pharmaceutical,
financial and telecommunications businesses. Also says trade will
promote freedom in China.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-Harding:
</P>
<P>
   Supports trade deal. Says turning down the deal would put the
United States at a disadvantage against nations in Europe, Asia and
Latin America that do normalize trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   Rush Holt, D-Pennington:
</P>
<P>
   Opposes trade deal. Says concerns over human rights, worker
conditions and treatment of the environment in China outweigh new
opportunities for U.S. businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Frank LoBiondo, R-Vineland:
</P>
<P>
   Opposes the trade deal as bad for U.S. workers.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Menendez, D-Union City:
</P>
<P>
   Opposes trade deal. Says China is still guilty of forcing
abortions, arresting dissidents and other human rights abuses.
Questions whether China will follow the rules of free trade by
opening its market to goods.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Pascrell, D-Paterson:
</P>
<P>
   Opposes trade deal. Says American jobs are at stake and that the
China trade vote is the chance to end 20 years of losses in
American manufacturing. Cites U.S. Commerce Department figures that
project the trade deal would cost New Jersey 22,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Pallone, D-Long Branch:
</P>
<P>
   Opposes trade deal. Says annual review of
''most-favored-nation'' status gives United States leverage to make
China accountable for mistreating citizens, destroying environment
and threatening Taiwan, India and other Asian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Payne, D-Newark:
</P>
<P>
   Undecided, but leaning toward voting against trade deal.
According to foreign affairs adviser Charisse Glassman, Payne has
concerns about labor, environment and human rights in China but
feels the world is moving toward globalization.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Rothman, D-Fair Lawn:
</P>
<P>
   Opposes trade deal. Says China has failed to comply with earlier
trade agreements. Favors a continuation of annual
''most-favored-nation'' status for China as a way to monitor human
rights abuses in China.
</P>
<P>
   Marge Roukema, R-Ridgewood:
</P>
<P>
   Supports trade deal as good for New Jersey businesses and a step
forward for human rights. Says a strong economic relationship with
China will encourage movement toward greater human rights there.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Saxton, R-Mount Holly:
</P>
<P>
   Opposes trade deal. Says annual reviews of
''most-favored-nation'' trading status gives Congress a small
degree of leverage to hold China accountable for human rights
violations and trading weapons technology to other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Smith, R-Robbinsville:
</P>
<P>
   Opposes trade deal. Says China is guilty of flagrant human
rights violations, devastation of the environment and a military
hostility toward the world's democracies.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Pullout Praised by Beilin  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's chaotic withdrawal from south Lebanon,
a nightmare to frightened residents near the border, is a ''dream
come true'' to one of the first activists to urge a unilateral
pullout.
</P>
<P>
   Despite scenes of Hezbollah guerrillas overrunning positions
Israeli forces held until a few days ago, and Israel-allied
militiamen fleeing in panic, Justice Minister Yossi Beilin told The
Associated Press that he feels vindicated after a three-year,
uphill battle to get Israel's army out.
</P>
<P>
   Beilin admitted that without the Israel-controlled buffer zone,
guerrillas might attack border communities. Even so, ''I believe
that any price in the future will be much smaller, if at all,
compared to the price we have paid already,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, when Beilin set up a movement to call for an
Israeli exit from Lebanon, he and his backers were a tiny, noisy,
radical minority. They were pelted with eggs and curses as they
demonstrated at highway intersections.
</P>
<P>
   Beilin, in the parliamentary opposition wilderness at the time,
bucked his own Labor Party, which was calling for a negotiated
settlement. He declared that any kind of withdrawal from Lebanon
was better than staying there, as dozens of Israeli soldiers were
dying for no reason.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents charged that he was undermining army morale and
insisted that Israel's occupation of its ''security zone'' was
protecting border communities from Hezbollah attacks. But the
rising casualties wore down Israel's resolve.
</P>
<P>
   The baby-faced Beilin, 51, said the turnaround in the public's
attitude came last year when Ehud Barak, a former army chief of
staff running for prime minister, pledged to pull Israeli forces
out of Lebanon within a year of taking office.
</P>
<P>
   With Barak in favor of a pullout, the concept ''became much,
much stronger and people trusted it much more,'' said Beilin, who
joined Barak's Cabinet after his election victory.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time Beilin has been far out in front,
waiting for the pack to catch up. He helped conduct secret
negotiations with the Palestinians at a time when Yasser Arafat's
PLO was still outlawed in Israel. The talks resulted in the first
interim peace accord in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Beilin said that it would have been preferable to coordinate the
pullback with Syria and Lebanon, but when that proved impossible, a
unilateral pullout was the right move.
</P>
<P>
   He rejected charges that the pullout showed that Israel does not
have the strength to stand up to Hezbollah attacks. ''If a state is
willing to defend itself from its own borders, it is a
demonstration of strength, rather than of weakness,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Commissioner Refuses To Testify  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HOWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- California's insurance commissioner,
under fire for letting insurers avoid billions in potential
earthquake-related fines by donating far less to a nonprofit fund,
refused to testify before a legislative committee Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush told the Senate Insurance
Committee that he refused ''to walk into a political ambush'' and
was heeding the advice of his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jackie Speier, the committee's chairwoman, said the Senate
would subpoena Quackenbush for another hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is probing Quackenbush's decision to let insurers
avoid up to $3 billion in potential fines for mishandled 1994
Northridge earthquake-related claims by donating about $12 million
to a new fund.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush said the California Research and Assistance Fund was
created in April 1999 for consumer aid and seismic research, but he
has acknowledged none of the money had been spent for either
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say much of the fund's spending, including public
service TV ads featuring Quackenbush, has benefitted him
politically.
</P>
<P>
   At Attorney General Bill Lockyer's request, a judge has
temporarily frozen the fund's remaining $6 million and is
considering making the order permanent.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement to the committee, Quackenbush defended his
record as commissioner and said he created the fund to help
consumers. He said he would ask a management consultant to help
develop better procedures for administering it.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush said his attorney advised him to avoid the hearing
and instead await the completion of the attorney's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican commissioner said a legislative e-mail he
obtained showed Democrats, who control the Legislature, were
conducting a partisan witchhunt.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't write a letter to Quackenbush on anything. We have to
set him up first, which should be fairly easy,'' Anne Mitchell, an
Assembly staff member, wrote in the e-mail to Speier's staff
director, Richard Steffens, who was investigating Insurance
Department settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats refuted the charge, noting that the e-mail at issue
was written more than a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Deals Abound in China Trade Battle  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The glassy wing sharpshooter bug and a Texas
pipeline don't have much to do with U.S. trade relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Clinton administration engaged Tuesday in a furious
game of ''Let's Make a Deal,'' those and other issues were suddenly
taking on new importance in the congressional battle over whether
to normalize trade relations with China permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers insisted they were not trading away their votes for
special favors, only using the opportunity of face-to-face meetings
with top administration officials to bring up issues important to
their districts.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents viewed the entire exercise more cynically.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a vile display of vote trading on one of the most
important issues of our time,'' said Lori Wallach, head of Public
Citizen's Global Trade Watch, one of the groups opposed to ending
the annual congressional review of China's trade privileges.
</P>
<P>
   In a report entitled ''The Clinton Record on Trade-Vote Deal
Making: High Infidelity,'' Global Trade Watch accused the
administration of breaking many promises it made to members of
Congress to obtain their support for the 1993 North American Free
Trade Agreement with Mexico. The group contends the same will
happen this time, especially with a lame duck president.
</P>
<P>
   ''The candy store is open, but the shelves are kind of bare,''
Wallach charged. ''Some naive people who have taken deals are going
to get hung out to dry.''
</P>
<P>
   However, those warnings have not stopped lawmakers, especially
junior House members who often have trouble gaining audiences with
top administration officials, from raising a variety of issues.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Silvestre Reyes, a Texas Democrat in his second term, used
the opportunity of a golf outing with President Clinton to raise
his concerns that a Houston to El Paso pipeline to transport
gasoline is being delayed by the lack of a ruling from the
Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes announced Tuesday he will vote for the China bill after
the administration assured him of ''an expeditious decision'' by
the EPA. ''I did not ask the White House for a guarantee of a
favorable decision. That would jeopardize the process,'' he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif., a first-term congressman, used a
meeting with Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman to make his case
for more federal support to fight the glassy wing sharpshooter, a
bug that is threatening the California wine industry.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who announced Monday night he would support the China
trade deal, also recently won approval from the U.S. Postal Service
for a new zip code he has been seeking for nine years since he was
in the California legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Matovcik, Thompson's chief of staff, said Thompson decided to
vote for permanent normal trade relations with China based on the
creation of a human rights monitoring commission and added
protections against import surges. But he said Thompson was happy
to have the White House attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the White House contacted him about PNTR, he said, 'It is
nice to hear from you now when I wasn't getting my phone calls
returned before,''' Matovcik said.
</P>
<P>
   The extra attention hasn't just been lavished on junior
backbenchers. Rep. Martin Frost, the third-ranking Democrat in the
House, has pushed the administration to pay for modernizing a
Northrop Grumman Corp. defense plant in Grand Prairie, Texas, the
largest employer in his district. Frost announced his support late
Tuesday, issuing a statement that his vote was influenced by an
agreement Northrop Grumman reached with the government that will
allow the company to keep its plant in Grand Prairie
</P>
<P>
   For Rep. Paul Kanjorski, a senior Democrat from Pennsylvania,
the issue has been obtaining support for tax breaks to spur
investment in his state's depressed coal regions.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., has said he will not vote for the
China legislation unless the administration agrees to amendments to
a 1974 trade law to provide protection against imported steel slabs
that represent a threat to taconite miners in northern Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The attention from top administration officials and American
corporations does not stop when a lawmaker announces his decision.
</P>
<P>
   When Rep. Marty Meehan, D-Mass., announced his support of the
trade pact last week, Clinton and top executives from high-tech
companies like Intel and Raytheon rushed to praise his decision.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, organized labor -- which opposes the trade
deal -- warns that lawmakers should not forget about the organizing
clout that unions can provide in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no way we can compete (financially) with business ...
nor can we come up with the deals that the president is offering,
but we do think we have the strength of our rank and file,''
AFL-CIO President John Sweeney said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bills are H.R. 4444 and S. 2277.

<HEADLINE> Israelis Blow Up Own Outposts  </HEADLINE>
By ZEINA KARAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   BINT JBEIL, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli troops blew up several
outposts in an acceleration of their withdrawal early Wednesday,
leaving southern Lebanon to Shiite Muslim guerrillas who have been
filling a power vacuum created by departing enemies.
</P>
<P>
   All day Tuesday, jubilant guerrillas assumed the positions
abandoned by Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army militiamen, who
surrendered or fled into Israel, leaving tanks and weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Before dawn Wednesday, Israel blew up five of its eight
remaining military posts in the south as it stepped up plans to end
two decades of occupation, military sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Convoys of Israeli troops were headed to the Israeli border in
what appeared to be the final stage of the Israeli pullout.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli withdrawal had begun overnight Monday. During the
day Tuesday, homeward-bound Israeli soldiers honked jeep horns and
kissed the ground after crossing the frontier into Israel, where
hundreds of panicky militiamen and their families converged in
search of asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Israel had set July 7 as the deadline for its withdrawal, but
the collapse of its militia allies speeded up the army's exit from
the security zone, created in 1985 to protect Israel's northern
settlements from cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the retreat, fighting continued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Israel sent Merkava battle tanks to protect its retreating
troops. Israeli air force jets rocketed guerrilla positions and
destroyed unneeded roads into its old enclave. By Tuesday night,
the Israeli army had abandoned several front-line positions and
pulled armor and artillery from the area of Marjayoun, the town
that served as the enclave's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The army also abandoned Bint Jbeil, Israel's second-largest base
in Lebanon, and crowds of Lebanese guerrillas and sympathizers
surged in to reclaim the village of 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Fighters and civilians alike waved the flags of the main Shiite
guerrilla groups -- Hezbollah and Amal. Some carried pictures of
Hezbollah chief Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, and others shouted ''God
protect him.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an unforgettable moment,'' said Hala Ayoub, 55,
squeezing her 18-year-old son whom she saw only once a year outside
the zone. Many young Lebanese stayed away from the zone for fear of
being forcibly recruited into the Israeli-allied South Lebanon
Army.
</P>
<P>
   The scene of celebration was repeated Tuesday in dozens of
villages, where hundreds of SLA militiamen surrendered or fled with
families to Israel, giving the guerrillas unimpeded access to the
border. In the east, militiamen abandoned the notorious Khiam
prison, leaving 140 inmates to walk free.
</P>
<P>
   In Chihin, 100-year-old Hamdiyyah al-Meri joined dancers,
stomping her feet with the aid of a cane. ''Nothing can stop me
now,'' said al-Meri, a smile exposing her missing teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Tuffaha Hmoud looked on smiling and said: ''This is the happiest
moment of my life.'' Hmoud, 48, was reunited with her son, Ali, who
had been living with six siblings outside the village to avoid the
SLA.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, border residents took to their bomb shelters Tuesday,
fearing possible reprisal attacks.
</P>
<P>
   At Fatima Gate, an inland border crossing into Israel, hundreds
of militiamen and their families left cars backed up for miles and
finished the journey on foot, carrying suitcases crammed with their
belongings. Several hundred more fled through the Naqoura border
post on the Mediterranean coast.
</P>
<P>
   Among those heading to Israel were the widow and six daughters
of the late Maj. Saad Haddad, the first Lebanese military man to
publicly ally himself with Israel. Haddad, a renegade from the
Lebanese army in the opening years of the 1975-90 civil war,
founded the Army of Free Lebanon, forerunner of the South Lebanon
Army.
</P>
<P>
   Just before sundown, the stream of refugees came to a standstill
when gunmen opened fire on Israeli troops from a high-rise building
in Kfar Kila. Refugees ducked behind parked cars. At one point
about a dozen sprinted toward the Israeli side as bullets flew
above.
</P>

   Two Israeli soldiers crouching behind a car at the gate fired

<HEADLINE> Swiss Make Holocaust Apology  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERN, Switzerland (AP) -- The Swiss government apologized to a
Jewish brother and sister Tuesday for having expelled them with
their parents during the Holocaust, and agreed to pay them $118,000
in an out-of-court settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Sonabend, whose parents later perished at the Auschwitz
death camp in Poland, said the meeting with Finance Minister Kaspar
Villiger and Interior Minister Ruth Dreifuss was comforting.
</P>
<P>
   ''My sister and I never understood in all those years what took
place against innocent people,'' Sonabend told reporters. ''It's
comforting to note that, on the part of the thinking Swiss, they
too can't understand why it all took place.''
</P>
<P>
   The $118,000, which the Finance Ministry will pay to Charles and
Sabine Sonabend, is an out-of-court settlement to cover costs
incurred during their legal battle.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Supreme Court awarded plaintiff Joseph Spring
$59,000 to cover his legal costs. Many other Holocaust survivors
sought redress through a $1.25 billion class-action settlement
reached with two Swiss banks in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Sonabend said he filed the lawsuit because he thought
media attention was the only way to get through to today's young
about what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Villiger said he and Dreifuss had felt a need to meet with the
Sonabends, ''people who were affected by our refugee policy,'' and
to listen to their questions, some of which had no answers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course suffering cannot be soothed or forgotten in this
way,'' he said. ''Mistakes also cannot be corrected. But such a
meeting can help us to understand, and never to forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by Germany, Nazi-occupied France and Nazi-allied
Italy during World War II, neutral Switzerland took in nearly
30,000 Jews. But, fearing it would be swamped by refugees or
provoke Germany's ire, it repelled an equal number to face almost
certain death.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Sonabend -- a watch retailer in Belgium -- had taken his
family to Switzerland in August 1942, hoping to escape the Nazis.
But the family arrived just as Switzerland began rejecting all
Jewish refugees. When they tried to register, they were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The parents were sent to Auschwitz and almost immediately
gassed. The children were smuggled by a Jewish group to Paris,
where they remained for the rest of the war in hiding.
</P>
<P>
   Charles said the Swiss officials at the time ''were criminals,
knowing full well what they were doing when they deported innocent
Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said it was historic that any government ''apologized for
what had taken place 60 years earlier, not what they had done, but
for what their grandparents had done.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles now lives in London, and his sister lives in Brussels.

<HEADLINE> Army Nurse Corps Gets Male Chief  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The top nurse at the nation's largest
military basic training center was promoted Tuesday to head the
Army Nurse Corps, making him the first man to hold the post.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was not in my wildest dreams,'' Brig. Gen. William T.
Bester, a 26-year Army veteran, said Tuesday before a promotion
ceremony at Fort Jackson. ''I personally don't put the emphasis on
the fact that I'm a male who's been selected.''
</P>
<P>
   Bester, 49, has run Fort Jackson's hospital since 1998, when he
became its first commander who was not a doctor under new
regulations that allow hospital commanders who are not physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Bester will transfer to the Pentagon and take control
of the Army's 3,400 active-duty nurses. He also will be the Army's
assistant surgeon general for force projection, overseeing policy,
management and health services delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Women had always led the Army Nurse Corps since it became a
permanent part of the Army Medical Department in 1901. Men were not
even allowed to be commissioned into the corps until 1955.

<HEADLINE> Testimony in Alleged Cuban Spy Case  </HEADLINE>
By MEG RICHARDS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A senior INS official charged with passing
classified information to a suspected Cuban agent testified Tuesday
that he didn't believe his friend was a spy and was discussing
doing business in Cuba, not U.S. secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI accuses Mariano Faget, 54, of passing information to
Pedro Font, Faget's business partner and longtime friend. The FBI
suspects Font is a Cuban spy, although he has not been charged.
</P>
<P>
   Faget, who could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted,
said he told agents during a six-hour interview that Font is not a
spy. He also testified that he cooperated with investigators during
the interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had a fixation that I was not telling the truth,'' Faget
said. ''I admit, at the beginning there might have been some doubt,
but when confronted with all that (evidence), how can you lie?''
</P>
<P>
   Faget was referring to FBI surveillance tapes that showed him
meeting with Cuban officials, and phone taps that revealed his
conversations with Font.
</P>
<P>
   In a videotaped FBI sting, Faget was shown classified documents
related to Cuban diplomat Luis Molina, and told that the Cuban
official was about to defect. Faget called Font about 12 minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
   Faget said he knew that Font, a Cuban citizen who works in New
York, was meeting with Cuban diplomat Jose Imperatori that day, and
Faget was concerned for his safety. Faget testified that he never
intended for Font to pass the information on to Imperatori.
</P>
<P>
   Faget testified that he met with Imperatori once, and either saw
or spoke to Molina four times. He said the only topic ever
discussed with either official was the potential for doing business
in Cuba after the U.S. trade embargo is lifted.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has since identified Molina as an intelligence agent.

<HEADLINE> Barak Defends Withdrawal  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Tuesday defended
Israel's Lebanon withdrawal, and accused regional power-broker
Syria of trying to sabotage the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Barak told Channel 1 television that he was so moved by the
homecoming of Israeli soldiers from Lebanon that it ''sent a shiver
down his spine.'' He said that was what made his decision to
withdraw the troops worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   And in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and key
world leaders, Barak said Syria has been cynically exploiting the
Palestinians in Lebanon ''to commit terrorist acts against Israel
after the withdrawal.''
</P>
<P>
   Syria is also providing a free hand to Iran and its Hezbollah
supporters ''to build infrastructures which would undermine
regional stability to the point of possible outbreak of
hostilities,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once we have completed our withdrawal from Lebanon, Israel, as
any other country in the world, will not tolerate a situation in
which its sovereign territory is attacked and its citizens face
constant life threatening situations,'' the Israeli leader said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak urged the secretary-general ''to put and keep Syria on
record on this issue, in order to prevent unnecessary deterioration
in regional stability in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   Syria has over 30,000 troops in Lebanon and is the real ruler
there. Israel regards Syria as responsible for Hezbollah attacks
partly because the guerrillas arms are all delivered from Iran
through Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Since Monday, Israeli-backed South Lebanese Army militia has
collapsed and the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah guerrillas have overrun
most of the strip of land which Israel occupies in south Lebanon to
protect its northern border against guerrilla attacks. Israel has
also stepped up the pace of its withdrawal from the region.
</P>
<P>
   Barak told Channel One television the chaos will last only a
short time and ''when the dust settles in a few days'' the
withdrawal will end Israel's entanglement in Lebanon which has cost
the lives of over a thousand soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said it was the Israeli presence in Lebanon which created
the Hezbollah guerrilla group. Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 to
expel Palestinian guerrillas who had been harassing the Israeli
border in the previous decade. The Hezbollah group did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis expelled the PLO and its leader Yasser Arafat from
Beirut, but as the Israeli presence continued there was growing
resistance from Lebanese groups, notably Hezbollah, which was
trained and armed by Iran.
</P>
<P>
   He implied that Israel could have withdrawn from Lebanon years
ago but did not do so due to inertia. It took a government with the
determination to make a clean break to end the vicious circle, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the SLA has left the Israeli soldiers remaining
inside Lebanon isolated in a number of fortified outposts, with the
guerrillas in a position to threaten them during their expected
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli withdrawal was originally scheduled to be over by
July 7, but Barak said Tuesday it would be completed within ten
days. Since no advance warning is given of the evacuation of
Israeli positions in Lebanon, the final pull-out could come at any
time.

<HEADLINE> Report: Pinochet Immunity Lifted  </HEADLINE>
By EDUARDO GALLARDO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- A Chilean court voted Tuesday on whether
Gen. Augusto Pinochet will be forced to stand trial on charges of
human rights violations, but said the ruling will be made public
within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Local media reports said the judges had voted 12-10 to lift
Pinochet's immunity, but the court refused to comment on the
reports. The government also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   If the ruling indeed went against Pinochet, it can be appealed
before the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ''A decision has been made,'' Ruben Ballesteros, president of
the Santiago Court of Appeals said after the surprise session by
the court's 22 judges.
</P>
<P>
   No explanation was given for why the session, originally
scheduled for Wednesday, was held Tuesday. The rescheduling may
have been part of an effort to avoid mass demonstrations by
supporters and foes of Pinochet that have marked previous hearings
in April.
</P>
<P>
   Small groups Pinochet supporters and opponents gathered outside
the court Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled on whether the former dictator should be
stripped of the immunity from prosecution he currently enjoys as a
senator-for-life -- a post he created for himself during his 17-year
regime. If lifted, he could be put on trial for alleged abuses that
occurred after his 1973 coup against Chile's elected government.
</P>
<P>
   According to an official report compiled by the civilian
government that succeeded Pinochet, 3,191 people died or
disappeared under Pinochet's military rule.
</P>
<P>
   There were no indications of what decision the judges had
reached.
</P>
<P>
   The judges based their undisclosed ruling on arguments last
month by seven lawyers for the plaintiffs and one for Pinochet, and
on a report by Judge Juan Guzman, who is handling 108 criminal
complaints against the former dictator.
</P>
<P>
   The military, especially the army, remain loyal to Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   A ruling against Pinochet ''would not be satisfactory for us,''
said army chief Gen. Ricardo Izurieta, prompting criticism from
anti-Pinochet politicians and human rights activists who claimed
the remark placed undue military pressure on the court.
</P>
<P>
   President Ricardo Lagos, a socialist who was briefly jailed
under Pinochet, has vowed to make sure the court ruling will be
respected and urged ''all sectors in the country'' to refrain from
pressuring the court.
</P>
<P>
   The case picked by Guzman to seek the lifting of Pinochet's
immunity and his trial is one of the most emblematic of the abuses
under his regime: the so-called ''caravan of death.'' It refers to
a group of officers who toured several cities soon after the coup,
dragging political prisoners from jail and executing them.
</P>
<P>
   While 75 people were killed, Guzman centered his case against
Pinochet on 19 of them who are still missing, calling the situation
''a case of ongoing kidnapping.''
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing followers of Pinochet angrily reject the judge's
stance.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a ridiculous joke,'' said congressman Pablo Longueira,
head of the Independent Democratic Union and a staunch Pinochet
supporter. ''We all know those people are dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Pinochet had defended himself through retired Gen.
Luis Cortes, a close associate. After meeting with Pinochet, Cortes
said: ''He told me: 'Please tell everybody that I never ordered
anybody to be killed or tortured.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet returned home in February after being held for 16
months in London, where he blocked efforts to be extradited to
Spain for trial. He was released by Britain after doctors there
determined he was physically and mentally unfit for trial. The
conclusion was supported by Pinochet's doctors in Chile.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Resumes Air Raids  </HEADLINE>
By NEELESH MISRA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Sri Lankan warplanes bombed rebel
positions Tuesday, part of a battle the president said was so
important that people should cancel ''unnecessary celebrations''
and donate part of their salaries to the war effort instead.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, India said it was prepared to help evacuate the
40,000 Sri Lankan troops from the northern peninsula of Jaffna if
Sri Lanka requested it.
</P>
<P>
   ''India is not going to intervene in the conflict. What we are
talking about is humanitarian assistance,'' the Press Trust of
India quoted National Security Adviser Brajesh Mishra as saying.
</P>
<P>
   In the northern battleground, government air force jets bombed
about six Tamil Tiger rebel positions on the peninsula, said
military spokesman Brig. Palitha Fernando.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are ready to face the rebels,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tamils appeared to be carrying their fight for a homeland
beyond the battlefield. In the northeast, two suspected Tamil Tiger
rebels posing as job seekers tried to assassinate former lawmaker
M.K. Gunawardene.
</P>
<P>
   But guards shot one assailant dead and the other killed himself
by setting off a grenade in the town of Kantale, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the nation on television, President Chandrika
Kumaratunga said: ''People of Sri Lanka in their entirety are today
facing a most decisive moment in their history.''
</P>
<P>
   Kumaratunga did not detail what she called ''a grave crisis''
but outlined measures to raise money for the war, saying people
should put off some celebrations, donate two days' salary each
month to the war fund and join a welfare program for wounded
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The Voice of the Tigers radio station appealed to civilians in
their areas to construct bomb shelters to defend themselves against
air force bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The Tamil Tigers said on their Web sites that four civilians
were killed and eight wounded Monday in an army artillery barrage
in an area captured by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from the government and rebels cannot be verified
because neither side allows journalists into the war zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Sri Lankan military, which has suffered reverses in the past
three weeks, claimed that it killed more than 150 rebels the past
two days near the town of Chavakachcheri in the Jaffna Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   In diplomacy, a Norwegian peace delegation was in the Sri Lankan
capital, Colombo, to try to bring rebel and government
representatives to the negotiating table for the first time in five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering will be in India on
Wednesday and Thursday, meeting with top defense and foreign
affairs officials before heading to Colombo for talks with the Sri
Lankan government.
</P>
<P>
   The Tamil Tigers have fought for 17 years to create a Tamil
homeland in the east and northeast, saying they are widely
discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese in education and
jobs.

<HEADLINE> S.C. Nuke Station Licenses Renewed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The Nuclear Regulatory Commission agreed
Tuesday to renew the license of the Duke Energy Corp.-owned Oconee
Nuclear Station near Seneca for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The plant's original 40-year licenses expire in 2013 and 2014,
so the decision means the plant should be able to operate for at
least 30 more years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're extremely pleased with the decision,'' said Duke Power
spokesman Tom Shiel. ''The station has been operating safely for 27
years.''
</P>
<P>
   This is only the second license renewal approved by the
commission. But the agency is expected to review dozens of
applications over the next few years as licenses run out on the
nation's 103 nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said it granted the renewal after the agency's
technical staff gave its approval earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and engineers inspected the facility twice last year.
They found no safety concerns and said Duke Energy was doing a good
job of repairing and maintaining the plant that opened in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Duke Power's three nuclear power plants provide half the
electricity to the company's 2 million customers, the company said.
Along with the Oconee Nuclear Station, the utility operates plants
near Clover and Huntersville, N.C.

</P>
<P>
   Play was delayed four hours because of a heavy mist at
Pepperdine, located on the coast. As a result, third-round matches
were pushed back until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a little strange having things delayed today for more

   Defending NCAA champion Zuzana Lesenarova of San Diego, seeded
fourth, advanced with a 7-6 (3), 6-3 win over Mira Radu of
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just tried to be aggressive during the entire match,''
Lesenarova said. ''I made too many mistakes in the first set, but
then I settled down and started to play with more consistency.''

<HEADLINE> Brewers' Jenkins May Return Soon  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Geoff Jenkins could be back in the Milwaukee
Brewers' lineup as soon as this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers' starting left fielder and most promising young star
broke a bone in the middle finger on his right hand when he lost
control of his bat on May 5. Since then, he has stewed on the bench
while his teammates have won nine of their last 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   He was projected to be out for a month. But after three weeks of
inactivity, he said he hopes to play in the Brewers' series at the
Arizona Diamondbacks, which starts Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope they'll let me try it,'' Jenkins said. ''It's feeling a
lot better now.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins has taken batting practice with the team this week. The
Brewers were considering sending him to Phoenix, where he would
play in one extended spring training game before meeting the
Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   He could be activated on Friday or Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins led the Brewers in almost every offensive category when
he broke his finger on the nob of the bat, which then flew into the
crowd and broke a female spectator's arm.
</P>
<P>
   He is hitting .298 with 31 hits, 11 homers and 23 RBIs. His .663
slugging percentage still is easily the Brewers' best.
</P>
<P>
   In his place, career backup Lyle Mouton has played well, though
he doesn't provide the power threat Jenkins does. Mouton is hitting
.294 with two homers and 14 RBIs, and he had critical hits in three
Brewers wins during the current homestand.
</P>
<P>
   When Jenkins returns, the Brewers may be inclined to bench not
Mouton, but slumping center fielder Marquis Grissom. Since failing
as the team's leadoff hitter, Grissom is hitting .239 with no
homers and has been bumped to the bottom of the batting order.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Lopes said he wouldn't speculate on possible moves
until Jenkins' return is guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to see how it goes,'' Lopes said. ''We think he
only needs one game, but if he plays two, that would be fine. I
don't think he'll play Friday, but he might. We'll just have to see
what happens in the next day or two.''

Canadian Stock Markets Plunge
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- The country's biggest stock market plummeted more
than 300 points Tuesday and the Canadian dollar sank half a cent as
interest rate jitters and a technology selloff on Wall Street
battered investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Stock Exchange shot down 306.56 to 8,986.58 and the
dollar closed at 66.30 cents US, down 0.50 of a cent from Friday's
close and down a whopping three cents from early February.
</P>
<P>
   The western-based Canadian Venture Exchange lost 94.98 to

</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index fell nearly 200
points, sinking to its lowest close since last November as
investors sold off technology issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq closed down 199.52 points to 3,164.29. The Dow Jones
industrial average and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 also fell in a

Davie Fulton, Former Cabinet Minister and Supreme Court Judge, Dies
at 84
</P>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- E. Davie Fulton, a longtime
federal cabinet minister and British Columbia Supreme Court judge,
has died. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton was elected seven times to the House of Commons beginning
in 1949 as a Conservative MP for Kamloops.
</P>
<P>
   He ran unsuccessfully twice for the Conservative leadership,
losing to John Diefenbaker in 1956 and to Robert Stanfield in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   He was justice minister in Diefenbaker's government and also
held the attorney general, citizenship and immigration and public
works portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   He later served as a justice on B.C's Supreme Court from 1973 to
1981.

Alberta Braces for Health Strike
</P>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Bill Croyne depends on nurses' care
even to get dressed in the morning, so no one understands their
value better than him.
</P>
<P>
   But even he doesn't know if he supports plans for an illegal
strike on the part of 10,000 health-care workers at 159 Alberta
hospitals and long-term care facilities which was slated to begin
this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''The trouble is you start opening the door for another one,''
said Croyne, 80, from his long-term care bed in the Edmonton
General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''Would it mean the prison guards go on strike next?''
</P>
<P>
   The strike looked all but inevitable on Tuesday as four
health-care employers and the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees
remained far apart on the monetary issues that divided them and
spent more time in court than at the negotiating table.
</P>

Teachers Seek Hearings on New Duties
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Ontario's teachers are demanding public hearings
into proposed legislation forcing them to take on duties that
include chaperoning proms, coaching sports teams and supervising
lunchrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Polls conducted by teachers' unions suggest the vast majority of
teachers oppose Bill 74, contradicting Premier Mike Harris's
assertion that most of them support the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The results of this vote recognize the extreme frustration of
teachers,'' Earl Manners, president of the Ontario Secondary School
Teachers Federation, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll of the federation's 33,000 teachers last week, 99 per
cent of the majority who voted rejected the proposed legislation,
the first of its kind in Canada.

Tories Sue Alliance Over Party Name
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- The Canadian Alliance may be stealing Conservative
party members across the country but federal Tories took steps
Tuesday to prevent the fledgling movement from taking their name as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The beleaguered Progressive Conservative Party of Canada filed
suit against the Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance and its
predecessor, the Reform party, alleging the new name violates the
Trademarks Act.
</P>
<P>
   ''The basis of the lawsuit is that the PC Party has continuously
used the word Conservative since the formation of the party before
Confederation, including in conjunction with other words such as
the word Progressive,'' said a Conservative party statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Tories, battered by defections to the Alliance, are seeking
a permanent injunction from the Federal Court to prohibit the new
party from using the name in English or French.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Propose HMO Fixes  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO-
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic negotiators sent Republicans a set
of proposals Tuesday aimed at allaying GOP concerns that employers
could be sued by workers harmed when health plans deny care and
resolving other conflicts about a patient bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   Employers could only be sued if they are involved in making
medical decisions carried out by health plans under one proposal
from Democratic leaders working with Republicans on a compromise
bill to give Americans more leverage when dealing with health
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans oppose a bipartisan House bill that would
expand patients' rights to file lawsuits when coverage decisions
result in injury or death, saying companies will stop offering
health benefits rather than face expensive lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also said they would consider deferring to state
patient rights laws if those laws afford greater protections than
federal legislation. Republicans believe a federal patient bill of
rights should not preempt state laws governing HMOs and other
health plans.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats did not back off on their insistence that patients
get expanded rights to file lawsuits against health plans and that
all 161 million Americans in private health plans be covered by the
federal law. Senate Republicans oppose both provisions and favor
their own bill, which would provide no new rights to sue and extend
federal protections to about 48 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Talks to reach a compromise between the House and Senate bills
have stalled in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., chairman of a
House-Senate committee working on compromise legislation, Democrats
said they were open to GOP proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ''..we hope that you will be able to accept these suggestions or
respond with a proposal of your own that can form the basis for
expedited negotiations,'' said Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.,
committee co-chair, and Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., a member of
the committee.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Sen. Nickles could not be reached.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Tries To Save Elections  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela dispatched an air force jet
to Nebraska on Tuesday to fetch computers and experts in a last
ditch effort to salvage next weekend's presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   The elections have been jeopardized by technical glitches, bomb
threats and sabotage, election officials said.
</P>
<P>
   National Election Council head Etanislao Gonzalez placed much of
the blame for the technical difficulties on a Nebraska-based firm
called Election System and Software, which was contracted to
provide materials necessary for vote tabulation.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said the company had ''flagrantly failed'' to meet its
commitments, and that the failure had destabilized the country's
electoral process.
</P>
<P>
   John Groh, the Nebraska company's senior vice president of
international sales, said by phone from Omaha that constant changes
by election authorities in posting thousands of candidates were
hindering his firm's work.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they are blaming us because they are under political
pressure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the computer glitches, Gonzalez said the election
council had received numerous anonymous bomb threats and had
learned that saboteurs were planning to ''place a virus in the
council's computer system.''
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelans are scheduled to go to the polls on May 28 to elect
a president, a legislature, governors, mayors and local councils.
The new constitution pushed through last year by President Hugo
Chavez requires most public powers be ''re-legitimized.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gonzalez indicated that Venezuela might have to postpone the
vote if the difficulties were not solved by midday Wednesday. An
air force jet was being sent Tuesday to Omaha, he said, to pick up
equipment and personnel after two of the firm's technicians failed
to resolve computer glitches.
</P>
<P>
   Groh said the company was willing to send more equipment, but no
more technicians since ''we have all the people we need down
there.''
</P>
<P>
   With more than 6,000 public offices at stake, the elections are
the biggest in the South American nation's history. Seeking
re-election after only 15 months in office, Chavez is facing off
against former Zulia state governor Francisco Arias Cardenas, who
helped Chavez stage a failed 1992 coup but has since broken with
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Chavez's discourse ''cheap demagoguery,'' Arias wrapped
up his campaigning in the capital of Caracas Tuesday with a rally
attended by tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   ''We won't put up with dictatorships,'' he declared, blaming
Chavez for what he said was Venezuela's plunge into economic
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Arias has captured the support of Venezuela's upper and middle
classes, but Chavez still appears to hold sway in the slums and
shantytowns that are home to the majority of Venezuela's 23 million
people. Polls give the president a comfortable lead going into
Sunday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, Chavez told a local television station that he
had asked the U.S. government to take the ''necessary'' measures
against ES&AMP;S.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because it's very strange, and I underline very strange, that
two technicians who helped design the machine can't enter the
computer,'' Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
   Technical problems already forced the election council to
postpone an initial test, raising widespread concern about the
government's capacity to carry out the elections.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, two Venezuelan civil rights groups urged the highest
court to postpone the vote because of confusion and technical
difficulties. The Organization of American States observation team
also expressed concern that computer glitches could create problems
during the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The electoral process has also come under fire because the
electoral council was hand-picked by Chavez's leftist coalition in
an exercise widely criticized as undemocratic.

<HEADLINE> Pressure Builds on Fujimori in Peru  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- With five days left before Sunday's
presidential runoff, pressure built Tuesday on incumbent Alberto
Fujimori to postpone the vote or face political turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's national election watchdog group, Transparencia, said it
would ''abstain from observing Sunday's election.'' The move came
one day after the Organization of American States' monitoring
mission announced that it was suspending cooperation with election
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Stein, head of OAS delegation, said late Tuesday that
his mission had made headway in negotiating a possible postponement
of the vote with election officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mission understands that in this moment electoral
officials should be evaluating alternatives to overcome the
crisis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his monitors would observe in a new test Wednesday of
ballot-counting software that failed to meet the OAS' approval
three days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Transparencia's independent poll count provided a benchmark for
foreign governments and local politicians to insist on a runoff
vote to clear the air of fraud allegations in the first round April
9.
</P>
<P>
   Official results showed Fujimori falling just shy of the
majority necessary to avoid a runoff with challenger Alejandro
Toledo, whose supporters maintain that street protests and
international pressure were the only things that prevented Fujimori
from claiming a fraudulent victory.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department has fully backed Transparencia and the
OAS mission, and President Clinton signed a resolution last month
warning Fujimori that Peru could face diplomatic and economic
sanctions if election irregularities persisted.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington on Tuesday, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
said the United States would continue working with the OAS to
ensure fair elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is important to our bilateral relations, that we have
free and fair elections,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Transparencia, which receives large-scale funding from foreign
governments, including the United States, Canada and Germany, had
been prepared to send 20,000 volunteers to voting sites across the
country to conduct another ''quick count'' of ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, who last week announced he was boycotting Sunday's vote
to force a postponement, said Tuesday that he would begin telling
his supporters to spoil their ballots with the words ''no to
fraud.'' He had been asking Peruvians not to go to the polls in
defiance of a law that makes voting obligatory.
</P>
<P>
   But Toledo said he was changing the strategy because of an
aggressive ad campaign by election authorities warning that
absenteeism would be punished by stiff penalties, on top of a $33
fine. The minimum wage in Peru is less about $120 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The ad campaign reminded Peruvians that anyone who failed to
vote would be unable to obtain public medical insurance or social
security of any kind and be ineligible to receive a driver's
license or passport.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the OAS monitoring mission announced it was
''temporarily suspending cooperation'' with Peruvian election
officials, accusing them of trying to use its presence to endorse a
flawed ballot-counting system.

<HEADLINE> Ramsey Detector Results Questioned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Boulder authorities moved Tuesday to
discredit -- in advance -- the results of lie-detector tests JonBenet
Ramsey's parents have reportedly taken.
</P>
<P>
   Citing sources they did not identify, Denver television stations
reported that John and Patsy Ramsey have taken polygraph
examinations and would discuss the results at a news conference
Wednesday in Atlanta, where they now live.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the Ramseys, L. Lin Wood, said in a news release
that the Ramseys planned a news conference Wednesday, but it did
not say what the subject would be. Wood did not return a phone call
Tuesday evening asking for comment.
</P>
<P>
   KUSA-TV and KCNC-TV said they were not told who administered the
tests, but KUSA said no law enforcement officials were present.
</P>
<P>
   Boulder authorities reiterated their position that they will not
accept lie-detector results unless the tests are administered by
the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Ramsey family could take polygraph exams at any time for
publicity purposes. For law enforcement purposes, the Boulder
Police have set up the criteria they want, and that's the FBI,''
city spokeswoman Jana Petersen told KUSA-TV.
</P>
<P>
   JonBenet, 6, was found beaten and strangled in the basement of
her parents' upscale Boulder home on Dec. 26, 1996. Nobody has been
charged, but Boulder authorities have said John and Patsy Ramsey
remain under an ''umbrella of suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys have denied any involvement in their daughter's
death. In a recently published book they theorize she was killed by
an intruder.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys have offered to submit to lie-detector tests on an
effort to prove their innocence, but only if the tests were
administered in Atlanta by an independent examiner and the results
were made public.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys claimed the FBI was not independent because it was
involved in the investigation into their daughter's death.

<HEADLINE> McAdoo Elected to Hoop Fame Hall  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Bob McAdoo, a three-time NBA scoring champion,
postponed the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   As good as it felt when told he had been elected to the
Basketball Hall of Fame, McAdoo was too disappointed from the Miami
Heat's playoff loss Sunday to the New York Knicks to revel in the
honor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the ultimate goal for any player,'' McAdoo, an assistant
coach Miami coach Pat Riley the last five years, said Tuesday. ''It
means all your hard work -- your successes and failures -- hasn't be
in vain. It's something your kids and grandchildren and on down the
line ... they can go see your name, your face and your jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 16 nominees for this year's Hall of Fame in
Springfield, Mass. The hall will announce the results Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   However, McAdoo's election was disclosed at a Miami Heat news
conference. In addition, Arizona coach Lute Olson failed to be
elected, the Tucson Citizen reported, and James Worthy acknowledged
he did not make it, either.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had my fingers crossed, but that's the way it goes,'' Worthy
said. ''At least one North Carolina guy got in and I am very happy
for Bob. He was a guy who took me under his wing when I came to the
Lakers and helped me out. He's quite a man.''
</P>
<P>
   McAdoo spent 14 years in the NBA, playing with seven teams and
retiring in 1986. He was a four-time All-Star, a three-time scoring
champion and the league MVP in 1975. He won two titles with Los
Angeles Lakers, including Riley's first in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's highly deserving of it,'' said Riley, who announced
McAdoo's election at a postseason news conference. ''He's been
sweating it out for the last five or six years. For him to be
elected, especially someone that I coached back in the 80s during
the championships, it just makes me proud that he's part of our
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The nominees also include players Isiah Thomas, Bobby Jones,
Sidney Moncrief, Drazen Dalipagic; coaches Pat Head Summitt, Cathy
Rush, Morgan Wootten, Jim Phelan, Mirko Novosel; contributors C.M.
Newton and Junius Kellogg; and veterans Grady Lewis and Danny
Biasone.
</P>
<P>
   To be elected, a nominee needs 18 votes from the 24-member
committee. Induction is Oct. 13 in Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   Summitt, the Tennessee coach, and Rush, the former Immaculata
coach, were the only women nominated.
</P>
<P>
   In 26 seasons at Tennessee, Summitt has led the Lady Vols to six
national championships and has a 728-150 record.
</P>
<P>
   Rush coached for just seven years but led Immaculata College of
Philadelphia to three consecutive national titles, including the
first for women in 1972. Her teams went 149-15 and became the first
women's teams to play on national TV and at Madison Square Garden.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Seek Refuge in Israel  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE COPANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   FATIMA GATE, Israeli-Lebanese Border (AP) -- At daybreak,
relieved Israeli soldiers drove home through this border crossing
after a final tour in Lebanon; in the afternoon, Lebanese refugees
on the run from Hezbollah guerrillas rushed to the crossing to
request asylum in Israel; at sundown, Lebanese gunmen fired across
the gate from new positions on Israel's doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   In one turbulent day Tuesday, Fatima Gate and other border
points witnessed confusion, fear and celebration triggered by
Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli soldier fell to his knees, kissing the soil of his
homeland. A Lebanese girl wept as she waited with her mother to
step through Fatima Gate into Israel and an uncertain future. In
view of Israeli troops, a Lebanese villager stole a rifle and a
dark jacket from a car left by a fleeing Israeli-allied militiaman.
And two Israeli soldiers crouching behind a car at the gate fired
long volleys at a Lebanese sniper's nest in an unfinished high-rise
building.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1985, Israel and its allied militia, the South Lebanon
Army, had occupied a buffer zone in south Lebanon set up to guard
nearby northern Israel from guerrilla attacks. But the occupation
ended early Wednesday -- two months ahead of schedule -- when Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak issued an order to all Israeli soldiers
to depart. Military officials said the evacuation would take about
24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Israel had pledged to pull out of Lebanon by July 7, but it was
unprepared for the rapid disintegration of its ally, the SLA, which
in a space of three days -- from Sunday to Tuesday -- abandoned all
its positions in the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
   A truckload of Israeli soldiers leaving Bint Jbeil, the
second-largest Israeli command post in Lebanon, before daybreak
Tuesday waved guns in the air in joy, and one exuberant young man
shouted: ''Mom, I'm coming home for good!''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, trying to fend off widespread criticism that he
mishandled the withdrawal, said bringing the boys home was what
mattered.
</P>
<P>
   However, some soldiers were bitter. One complained that the
Israeli flag had been pulled down from Bint Jbeil without ceremony,
adding to the sense of shame many in Israel felt at the sight of
the retreat. ''A day of humiliation,'' read the banner headline in
Yediot Ahronot newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Others said that despite the painful images, Israel was on the
right path. Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, one of the first
proponents of a unilateral withdrawal, said Israel was finally
ending a ''march of folly'' it began with its 1982 invasion.
</P>
<P>
   The helter-skelter withdrawal let Lebanon's Shiite Muslim
Hezbollah guerrillas advance almost to the Israeli border, sending
Israeli border residents into underground bunkers and turning some
front-line communities into ghost towns. In the largest town,
Kiryat Shemona, about 15,000 residents -- two-thirds of the
population -- fled south out of guerrilla rocket range.
</P>
<P>
   Kiryat Shemona resident Ilana Aderi, 58, came above ground
briefly for bread and milk. She said she was tired of living in
fear.
</P>
<P>
   ''This whole city should be evacuated and turned into an army
base,'' she said angrily.
</P>
<P>
   Barak tried to steady Israeli nerves, sending tanks and troop
reinforcements to the frontier. Just north of the border town of
Metulla, a phalanx of tanks deployed in a field, guns aimed north.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, thousands of panicked SLA militiamen and their
relatives streamed south, trying to stay ahead of the guerrillas.
Facing the prospect of retribution from countrymen who consider
them traitors, they abandoned their cars at Fatima Gate and other
crossings, grabbed hastily packed suitcases and marched to the
border.
</P>
<P>
   Israel kept the gate closed for fear of losing control, and the
refugees stepped one by one through the metal rods of the barrier
after handing over weapons that were unloaded by Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Zaida Salameh, 43, said escape from Lebanon was the only choice.
''We just don't want to die. Nothing else is important,'' said
Salameh.
</P>
<P>
   She said Israeli soldiers told her she had half an hour to pack
and bring her family to safety. She grabbed a few clothes and
pictures from her husband's service in the SLA.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's very proud of his service,'' she said, adding that he
joined them later.
</P>
<P>
   Just before sundown, the stream of refugees came to a standstill
when gunmen opened fire on Israeli troops from a high-rise building
in Kfar Kila. Refugees ducked behind parked cars. At one point
about a dozen sprinted toward the Israeli side as bullets flew
above.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, about 3,000 Lebanese refugees had settled in a
temporary tent camp on the shores of the Sea of Galilee and in
hotels along the border.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The agent representing St. John's coach Mike
Jarvis denied Tuesday that he said his client was considering other
coaching opportunities after ending talks with the Washington
Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   The agent, Rob Ades, denied speaking to an Associated Press
reporter Monday night and saying that Jarvis was considering a
major college coaching position and other NBA possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Ades said he hadn't spoken to the AP at all.
</P>
<P>
   The story was based on a phone call with a person who identified
himself as Ades to an AP sports reporter.
</P>
<P>
   AP sports editor Terry Taylor said the news agency was checking
the source of the call.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis issued a statement Tuesday saying he has ''no interest in
any other college coaching job.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything that is said, in regards to any job regarding Mike
Jarvis, will be made by me and only me,'' Jarvis said. ''The
statements that are attributed to Rob Ades are false and
inaccurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis had been discussing the Wizards job with Jordan.

Barak Orders Full Withdrawal
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BINT JBEIL, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli troops blew up nearly all their remaining
positions early Wednesday as Prime Minister Ehud Barak ordered troops out of
southern Lebanon, leaving the border region to Shiite Muslim guerrillas.
Military officials said the evacuation would take about 24 hours. Israel had set
July 7 as the deadline for its withdrawal, but the collapse of its militia
allies expedited the army's exit from the security zone, created in 1985 to
protect Israel's northern settlements from cross-border attacks by Lebanese
guerrillas.

Report: United Buying US Airways
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The company that owns United Airlines, ranking No. 1 in the
world, reportedly has agreed to buy US Airways, which is the world's
10th-largest, for $4.3 billion in cash and the assumption of $7.3 billion in
debt and leases. The boards of both UAL Corp. and US Airways Group Inc. have
approved the deal, which will create an airline behemoth with 6,500 flights a
day and hubs on both coasts, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site
today, citing sources familiar with the deal. In contrast, the world's No. 2
carrier, American Airlines, offers but 3,600 daily flights.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two weeks before a U.S.-Russia arms summit, presidential
candidate George W. Bush said today he would slash America's nuclear arsenal to
its ''lowest possible number consistent with our national security,'' regardless
of whether Moscow went along. The reductions would be part of a broad national
security review that must include a missile-defense system, the Republican Texas
governor added. Bush offered no details about the size of the possible nuclear
cuts or the cost of a missile-defense system. He said he was trying ''to
demonstrate to Russia that we are no longer enemies.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House plunged into debate on landmark legislation to

last-minute support from previously undecided members. Shortly before the House
took up the bill -- a day earlier than expected -- backers claimed eight new

<HEADLINE> Orioles 4, Mariners 2  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken hit a two-run homer in the bottom of
the ninth inning, and the Baltimore Orioles ended a four-game
losing streak by defeating the Seattle Mariners 4-2 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles blew a 2-0 lead in the top of the inning, but
Ripken's shot off Jose Mesa (2-3) enabled Baltimore to salvage only
its third win in 18 games.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle singled leading off the ninth, and Harold Baines
hit a fly ball before Ripken lined a 2-0 pitch deep to left, his
eighth home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Brady Anderson and Harold Baines also homered for the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Buhner's two-run homer off Mike Timlin (1-1) set the stage
for Ripken's heroics. Seattle's Rickey Henderson drew his 2,000th
career walk in the ninth, joining Babe Ruth and Ted Williams as the
only players in baseball history with that many.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore starter Pat Rapp allowed four hits and three walks in
seven shutout innings and left with a 2-0 lead. But he was deprived
of his first win since April 25 when the Orioles' bullpen once
again failed.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in part to an ineffective relief corps that has blown a
major league-high 13 save chances, Baltimore starters have only one
win since April 29.
</P>
<P>
   After Jason Johnson blanked Seattle in the eighth, Timlin
promptly gave the lead away in the ninth. Edgar Martinez singled
and Buhner drove an 0-2 pitch into the left-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner stranded runners at first and third in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson led off Baltimore first by hitting the first pitch from
Gil Meche over the wall in center. It was his 39th career homer
leading off a game, second on the career list behind Henderson
(77).
</P>
<P>
   Baines hit his fourth homer leading off the second. Meche
buckled down after that, allowing only one runner past second base
before leaving after seven innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Anderson has six multihit games in his last seven starts.
... Despite the walk, Henderson went 0-for-4. ... The Orioles ended
a six-game losing streak at home. ... Seattle is 15-32 lifetime at
Camden Yards.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays 3, Red Sox 2  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Chris Carpenter outpitched Pedro Martinez, and
Tony Batista homered on Tuesday night as the Toronto Blue Jays beat
Boston 3-2 and sent the Red Sox to their third consecutive loss.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez (7-2) allowed a season-high seven hits and three earned
runs in eight innings as his major league-leading ERA rose from
0.90 to 1.19. Martinez, who struck out seven and walked three, had
not given up three earned runs in 18 starts since last Aug. 19, a
span that included last year's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter (4-5) was facing Martinez for the second consecutive
start, having lost 8-0 on May 17. The Toronto right-hander allowed
two runs, six hits and five walks in 5 2-3 innings, leaving with
the bases loaded in the sixth. Paul Quantrill retired Jose Offerman
on an inning-ending groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Koch, who wasted a ninth-inning lead Monday when Chicago's
Herbert Perry hit a two-run homer, pitched the ninth for his 10th
save.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez came into the game leading the AL in strikeouts and
tied for the lead in wins, but he ran into trouble from the first
batter. Shannon Stewart and Craig Grebeck led off the game with
singles and, after Raul Mondesi grounded into a fielder's choice,
Stewart came home on a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The run was the first allowed by Martinez in 17 innings. It was
also the first time he surrendered a first-inning run since Aug. 8,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox tied it in the bottom half when Offerman walked,
took third on John Valentin's single and scored on a double play.
But Martinez was in trouble again in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Gonzalez led off with a single, took second on Stewart's
single, third on Grebeck's walk and scored on Carlos Delgado's
sacrifice fly. Batista hit his 12th homer leading off the fourth,
ending an 0-for-13 slide and giving the Blue Jays a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Boston loaded the bases off Carpenter in the sixth when Brian
Daubach and Carl Everett singled and, two outs later, Jason Varitek
and Donnie Sadler walked to make it 3-2. But Quantrill got Offerman
to bounce the ball to first base to preserve the victory.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The attendance of 33,402 was Boston's largest at home this
year. ... Grebeck extended his hitting streak to nine games with a
first-inning single. Stewart extended his streak to seven games.
... The Minnesota Twins claimed 3B Casey Blake on waivers from the
Blue Jays and assigned him to Salt Lake City of the Pacific Coast
League. Toronto sent LHP Eric Gunderson outright to Syracuse of the
International League. ... With 32 strikeouts in his previous two
starts, Martinez tied Louis Tiant, Nolan Ryan and Randy Johnson for
the most strikeouts in consecutive games by an AL pitcher. Kerry
Wood holds the major league mark with 33. ... Toronto's previous
three wins came in its last at-bats.

<HEADLINE> LA Judge Tosses More Convictions  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HARRIGAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Four more convictions that resulted from
alleged police misconduct were thrown out by a judge on Tuesday,
including the first cases that arose outside of the city's
scandal-ridden Rampart station.
</P>
<P>
   Two Juvenile Court convictions last year for possession of crack
cocaine, resulting from arrests by officers who work out of the
city's Southeast station, were erased by Superior Court Judge Larry
P. Filder. Deputy District Attorney Richard Rosenthal said the two
officers involved allegedly prepared a false report on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was his only conviction. When I told him he was being
freed he was crying and thanking God,'' court-appointed juvenile
defense attorney Gary Farwell said of one youth, now 18, who has
spent about six months in custody.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wants to join the Air Force, which he couldn't do with a
felony record,'' Farwell said.
</P>
<P>
   The second juvenile, 17, will be released from a youth camp.
</P>
<P>
   Their cases were handled in closed court with the defendants not
identified.
</P>
<P>
   The District Attorney's office said former Southeast Division
Officer Jeffery Robb resigned from the force as a result of an
internal police investigation. Officer William Ferguson has been
suspended pending a police board hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The other convictions dismissed Tuesday involved Rafael Perez,
the Rampart station's rogue officer who broke the scandal open last
year when he began cooperating with investigators in exchange for a
lighter sentence for stealing cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Perez told investigators that anti-gang officers beat, robbed
and framed innocent people.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty six convictions have been thrown out from cases handled
in the Rampart station.

<HEADLINE> Barak Moves Being Second Guessed  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- For a man famous for precise and methodical
planning, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has found himself in an
unholy mess in south Lebanon. And his critics are having a field
day.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two days, Israelis have been transfixed by a
parade of indelible images: Hezbollah guerrillas planting their
flags almost on Israel's border, Israel's militia allies breaking
ranks to flee in terror, young Israeli soldiers kissing the ground
in relief at making it out of Lebanon alive.
</P>
<P>
   And early Wednesday, Barak officially ordered all Israeli
soldiers out of Lebanon in a pullback expected to be over by early
Thursday. All Israeli outposts and bases were evacuated within
hours of Barak's order.
</P>
<P>
   News reports on the withdrawal, meanwhile, hammered on the twin
themes of ineptitude and humiliation. One commentary in the Maariv
newspaper Tuesday likened Israel's last days in Lebanon to the fall
of Saigon, invoking scenes of helicopters lifting off from the
besieged U.S. Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said Israeli military tacticians had inexplicably failed
to anticipate Hezbollah guerrillas' use of Lebanese civilians as a
human wedge to overrun much of the Israeli-occupied zone, and that
Barak had committed himself to the troop pullout out of
overconfidence that he could first reach a peace deal with Syria,
the main power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's response, in a series of interviews Tuesday, was
characteristically phlegmatic. Yes, the former general said in
effect, it's a mess all right -- but not one of his making.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cut off a tragedy that lasted 18 years,'' he told army
radio, referring to Israel's presence in south Lebanon since a 1982
invasion that took Israeli troops deeper into the neighboring
country. ''We are ending a vicious cycle that prevented withdrawal
until now. ... Every time Hezbollah had the upper hand, we would
say we would not leave under pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Barak put a finger on one of the most sensitive
aspects of the pullout: In Israel, where military service is nearly
universal and army culture pervades much of daily life, the notion
of retreating under fire runs counter to a closely held battlefield
ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very sad day,'' lawmaker Amnon Rubenstein said. ''It
sets a very bad example, as if Israel can be driven out.''
</P>
<P>
   While the departure from Lebanon might look like a rout, the
prime minister and his partisans insisted it was the only way to
extricate Israel from a quagmire. Top officials depicted the buffer
zone in south Lebanon as a burden Israel was only too happy to
shake off.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hezbollah will make it out to be a big victory, but we know
the truth,'' said Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, who called
Israel's presence in the zone a ''long march of folly.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the criticism aimed at Barak was familiar, and from
expected quarters. Hawkish opposition leader Ariel Sharon, the
architect of the 1982 invasion, said Israeli forces should not have
left without first subduing any challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's wrong to carry out a unilateral withdrawal without
imposing quiet on south Lebanon first,'' he told Israel radio.
''The prime minister is not standing up to pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Such complaints found a ready audience in Israel's north, where
many people feel their safety is being trifled with.
</P>
<P>
   ''This whole city should be evacuated and turned into an army
base,'' said an irate Ilana Aderi, 58, emerging from a night in the
bomb shelters in the northern town of Kiryat Shemona. ''No one
should live here.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak and top aides counter by saying that the pullout actually
leaves Israel safer, because they have put Lebanon and Syria on
notice that any attack now will carry far harsher reprisals than
Israel wanted to risk while it had troops in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   A criticism likelier to stick was the Barak camp's apparent
failure to foresee the collapse of the Israeli-allied South Lebanon
Army -- particularly that of a predominantly Shiite Muslim brigade
manning key positions in the heart of the Israeli-occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who was the strategic genius that decided to begin the
withdrawal from the most problematic of sectors -- the central,
Shiite sector?'' commentator Alex Fishman demanded sarcastically in
the Yediot Ahronot daily.
</P>
<P>
   Debate was also growing inside and outside Israel over a new
danger: Hezbollah's unchecked presence on Israel's very doorstep.
Because the guerrillas have already seized control of the border
zone, a hoped-for U.N. deployment all the way down to Israel's
frontier now appears less likely.
</P>
<P>
   ''You want us to be a punching bag in the middle, everybody
taking potshots at us -- and everyone would then blame the U.N. for
everything that we are not responsible for?'' U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan asked at one point Monday, as the
Security Council was discussing deployment plans.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 6, Athletics 4  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- John Flaherty homered and Jose
Canseco drove in three runs for Tampa Bay to back the strong relief
pitching of Bryan Rekar, who took over for the injured Dave Eiland
and beat the Oakland Athletics 6-4 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rekar (1-2) allowed one run and six hits in a club-record 5 2-3
innings of relief after Eiland injured his left hip on a pitch to
Oakland's Randy Velarde in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Flaherty hit a solo homer off Omar Olivares (3-5) in the second
inning and added an RBI single in Tampa Bay's two-run third.
Canseco had a RBI single off the A's starter in the third and
singled off T.J. Mathews with the base loaded to drive in two more
runs in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays, who began the night with the worst record in the
majors, won for just the second time in nine games. The A's, who
stopped a season-high five-game losing streak on Sunday, have
dropped six of seven.
</P>
<P>
   Eiland faced two batters, throwing 12 pitches. He retired
leadoff man Terrence Long on a fly ball, then crumpled to the
ground in pain as he followed through on his fourth pitch to
Velarde.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old right-hander, who spent time on the disabled
list last season with left hip bursitis, was unable to put any
weight on his left leg as he was helped off the field by a trainer
and second baseman Miguel Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   Rekar allowed Miguel Tejada's sixth homer in the second inning,
but repeatedly worked out of jams in the next four innings as the
A's went 0-for-7 with runners in scoring position and stranded six
against the right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   Flaherty's homer wiped out a 1-0 deficit, and the Devil Rays
took a 2-1 lead when Cairo singled with two outs in the second and
scored on a double by Gerald Williams. Tampa Bay added two runs in
the third on the RBI singles by Canseco and Flaherty, who would
have had a double if Canseco hadn't rounded second base and decided
to return to the bag.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of errors by Tampa Bay shortstop Kevin Stocker led to an
unearned run that trimmed Oakland's deficit to 4-2 in the seventh.
The run was charged to Mark Guthrie, who replaced Rekar at the
beginning of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde had a two-run single off Roberto Hernandez in the eighth
to make the score 6-4. Hernandez got the last five outs for his
fourth save.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays, who had 10 hits off Olivares in six-plus
innings, loaded the bases with no outs in the seventh. With Oakland
playing him to pull the ball to the left, Canseco singled between
first and second base to drive in Tampa Bay's last two runs.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Tejada's fifth career homer against Tampa Bay came in his
53rd at bat against the Devil Rays ... Tampa Bay, which has played
the fewest home games (16) in the AL, began a stretch in which it
will play 19 of 25 games at Tropicana Field ... Oakland's Olmedo
Saenz, who singled off Jim Mecir in the seventh, is 4-for-7 as a
pinch-hitter ... Stocker has nine errors in 39 games.

<HEADLINE> Barak Orders Full Withdrawal  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE COPANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   METULLA, Israel (AP) -- Israeli troops evacuated their remaining
positions in south Lebanon before dawn Wednesday, carrying out an
unexpectedly hasty withdrawal that ended one of the most divisive
chapters in Israel's history.
</P>
<P>
   The final pullout began with departing troops blowing up most
remaining position after Prime Minister Ehud Barak ordered the
evacuation, leaving the border region to Shiite Muslim guerrillas
who have been rapidly filling the power vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   Barak initially planned to begin the pullback only several days
from now. However, his hand was forced when the South Lebanon Army
militia, Israel's ally, rapidly disintegrated. Over a span of
several days, SLA fighters abandoned posts and either surrendered
to advancing Hezbollah guerrillas or fled south, seeking asylum in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of soldiers, many dusty and tired-looking, drove across
the border in long convoys of tanks and truck. Several soldiers
atop a tank proudly help up a large Israeli flag. Others waved
olive branches. A few got climbed down from the armored vehicles
and hugged each other once they reached Israeli soil.
</P>
<P>
   ''The nightmare is over,'' said Ephraim Gandelberg, a bereaved
father whose son was killed in fighting in Lebanon in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   However, relief was tempered by concern that Israel would be
unable to extricate itself fully from what has been called the
''mire of Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said he would retaliate harshly for any Lebanese
guerrilla attacks on northern Israel, a scenario that could lead to
a renewed Israeli entanglement.
</P>
<P>
   By 5 a.m. Wednesday, all Israeli outposts in Lebanon had been
dismantled, Israeli military officials said. The last Israeli
troops were making their way across the border.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli withdrawal had begun overnight Monday. The
homeward-bound Israeli soldiers were joined by hundreds of panicky
militiamen and their families converged in search of asylum.
</P>
<P>
   All day Tuesday, jubilant guerrillas assumed the positions
abandoned by Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army militiamen, who
surrendered or fled into Israel, leaving tanks and weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the retreat, fighting continued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Israel sent Merkava battle tanks to protect its retreating
troops. Israeli air force jets rocketed guerrilla positions and
destroyed unneeded roads into its old enclave. By Tuesday night,
the Israeli army had abandoned several front-line positions and
pulled armor and artillery from the area of Marjayoun, the town
that served as the enclave's capital.
</P>
<P>
   When the army abandoned Bint Jbeil, Israel's second-largest base
in Lebanon, crowds of Lebanese guerrillas and sympathizers surged
in to reclaim the village of 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Fighters and civilians alike waved the flags of the main Shiite
guerrilla groups -- Hezbollah and Amal. Some carried pictures of
Hezbollah chief Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, and others shouted ''God
protect him.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an unforgettable moment,'' said Hala Ayoub, 55,
squeezing her 18-year-old son whom she saw only once a year outside
the zone. Many young Lebanese stayed away from the zone for fear of
being forcibly recruited into the Israeli-allied South Lebanon
Army.
</P>
<P>
   The scene of celebration was repeated Tuesday in dozens of
villages, where hundreds of SLA militiamen surrendered or fled with
families to Israel, giving the guerrillas unimpeded access to the
border. In the east, militiamen abandoned the notorious Khiam
prison, leaving 140 inmates to walk free.

<P>
   In Israel, border residents took to their bomb shelters Tuesday,
fearing possible reprisal attacks.
</P>
<P>
   At Fatima Gate, an inland border crossing into Israel, hundreds
of militiamen and their families left cars backed up for miles and
finished the journey on foot, carrying suitcases crammed with their
belongings. Several hundred more fled through the Naqoura border
post on the Mediterranean coast.
</P>
<P>
   Among those heading to Israel were the widow and six daughters
of the late Maj. Saad Haddad, the first Lebanese military man to
publicly ally himself with Israel. Haddad, a renegade from the
Lebanese army in the opening years of the 1975-90 civil war,
founded the Army of Free Lebanon, forerunner of the South Lebanon
Army.
</P>
<P>
   Just before sundown, the stream of refugees came to a standstill
when gunmen opened fire on Israeli troops from a high-rise building
in Kfar Kila. Refugees ducked behind parked cars. At one point
about a dozen sprinted toward the Israeli side as bullets flew
above.
</P>
<P>
   Two Israeli soldiers crouching behind a car at the gate fired
long volleys back at a Lebanese sniper's nest in the unfinished
high-rise.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, about 3,000 Lebanese refugees had entered Israel,
most taking refuge in a tent camp on the northern shore of the Sea
of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday six civilians were killed and 19 wounded when Israeli
and allied militia gunners opened fire in an attempt to halt the
masses streaming back to their hometowns.
</P>
<P>
   A Lebanese driver working with the British Broadcasting Corp.
was killed Tuesday when a shell landed beside his car near the
border, BBC Middle East correspondent Jeremy Bowen said. It was
unclear who fired the shell.
</P>
<P>
   The hundreds of SLA militiamen who surrendered Tuesday were
hauled away in Lebanese army trucks. They were expected to stand
trial on charges of collaboration that carry prison terms or even
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a beautiful scene to see the collaborators rounded up in
humiliation,'' said Nasser Fakhreddine, a 33-year-old truck driver.
</P>
<P>
   At Khiam prison, a forbidding hillside complex near Marjayoun,
residents broke the locks and freed its 140 prisoners, many held
for as long as 10 years without trial. Most had been accused of
attacking the SLA, aiding the guerrillas or refusing to join the
militia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tell my family I'm coming home,'' said inmate Mohammed Seyyed.

<HEADLINE> Heat Wave Hits Western U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER COLEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Record-breaking temperatures in the
90s and 100s across California have melted Sierra ski runs, closed
sidewalk cafes and brought pleas for energy conservation.
</P>
<P>
   The mercury has also been unseasonably high elsewhere in the
West this week, with Arizona and Nevada already seeing midsummer
heat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm hot, muggy, sweaty. The sun's beating me up,'' said Danny
Drum, a construction worker pushing a wheelbarrow in Las Vegas,
where the temperature Tuesday afternoon was 107, one degree over
the previous record for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix hit 106, but that was almost cool compared to other
places in Arizona this week -- a record 117 in Lake Havasu City and
116 in Bullhead City.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your brain goes numb,'' said Brad Meyer, a roofer in Lake
Havasu.
</P>
<P>
   Even San Francisco, usually foggy and cool well into spring and
early summer, saw record hot weather this week, topping 93 degrees
Sunday. That shattered the state's record for the day -- 86 degrees
in 1886.
</P>
<P>
   The heat wave struck while some power plants were down for
pre-summer maintenance, said Patrick Dorinson, spokesman for the
Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's power grid.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread air conditioner use prompted utility regulators to
declare an emergency Monday. Some businesses shut down in times of
unusually high demand in exchange for discounts on their power
bills.
</P>
<P>
   But by Tuesday, the power grid was back to normal, and easing
temperatures forecast for the rest of the week should allow
maintenance to continue.
</P>
<P>
   When the temperature topped 100 in Sacramento this week,
restaurant manager Lu Mohatt decided to have a sale -- 10 percent
off for customers who picked up their own orders.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hate to send my runners out in the heat,'' she said. ''I'm
always after them to drink more water and stay out of the heat when
it's like this.''
</P>
<P>
   With temperatures still in the upper 90s Tuesday, the cafe's
sidewalk tables sat empty as customers sought air conditioned spots
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the heat, the Squaw Valley ski resort near Lake
Tahoe, which expected to stay open Memorial Day weekend, may have
to close some runs, spokeswoman Katja Dahl said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mammoth Mountain ski resort in central California
expects to stay open into June, said spokeswoman Joani Saari.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last week we had four inches of new snow,'' she said. ''It's
been weird.''

<HEADLINE> Tide Shifts for China Trade Bill  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House plunged into debate on landmark
legislation to normalize trade with China on Tuesday after
supporters boasted new confidence they would prevail. A final
onslaught by organized labor failed to stem the flow of last-minute
support from previously undecided members.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the House took up the bill -- a day earlier than
expected -- backers claimed eight new converts.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new supporters was Democratic Caucus Chairman Martin
Frost and four other formerly undecided members of the Texas
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Frost, the highest-ranking Democrat to endorse the bill, said it
was ''a difficult decision'' but that, ''trade with China will
ultimately lead to more jobs in the United States, because it will
open an enormous market to the superior products made by American
workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday night, Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., chairman of the
Rules Committee, said negotiators had cleared away the last hurdles
to a floor vote on Wednesday with the inclusion of language sought
by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., to specifically list human
rights protections that a watchdog commission being created will
examine each year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to win tomorrow. I am convinced we are on track
for victory,'' Dreier said after the discussions with Cox had been
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently outnumbered, opponents weighed rallying behind an
effort to try to tie the trade benefits to Taiwan's security as a
last-ditch effort to sidetrack the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''China represents over one-quarter of the world's population,''
said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, as the House finally began its debate after months
of maneuvering. ''Over one billion people will not be ignored in
the international marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Those on both sides of the issue said they still expected a
close vote.
</P>
<P>
   Both Republican and Democratic vote counters said that
supporters on Tuesday had drawn within range of the needed 218
votes to pass the bill -- and might already be there.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders hope to produce about 150 of those votes,
while Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., the chief Democratic supporter,
said he now believes he can meet his target of 70-80 Democratic
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the formerly undecided members to announce their support
on Tuesday were Reps. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y.; Allen Boyd,
D-Fla.; Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, Solomon Ortiz, D-Texas; Sheila
Jackson Lee, D-Texas; Ruben Hinojosa, D-Texas; and Gregory Meeks,
D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Hinojosa and Meeks were the only two undecided members to take
the administration up last month on a trip to China to help them
make up their minds. Both said on Tuesday that the trip had been
helpful to them in reaching their decisions to support the bill.
</P>
<P>
   With the votes moving their way, House Republican leaders moved
quickly to bring the measure to the floor instead of waiting
another day.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who has made the bill a top legislative
priority of his final year, reminded lawmakers at the White House
on Tuesday to consider future generations before voting.
</P>
<P>
   ''The consequences of this vote will be felt after I am no
longer president,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with reporters after a Democratic fund-raiser Tuesday
night, Clinton said: ''I think we're going to make this PNTR vote
for China.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would extend permanent normal trade privileges to
China, guaranteeing China the same low-tariff access to U.S.
markets that nearly every other country in the world has. For the
past 20 years, China has received this preferential treatment -- but
it has had to be renewed annually.
</P>
<P>
   The new status is part of China's admission to the World Trade
Organization, the Geneva-based body that sets rules for world
trade.
</P>
<P>
   In return, China agreed to lower barriers to U.S. products and
investment.
</P>
<P>
   On a day in which both sides engaged in furious lobbying, even
Texas Gov. George W. Bush came to Capitol Hill to try to win more
converts among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the president has given it his best shot, and I was
happy to see the vice president finally emerge and make a
statement,'' the prospective GOP presidential candidate said.
</P>
<P>
   For two days in a row, Vice President Al Gore strongly endorsed
the legislation in speeches to union groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just want to tell you forthrightly I don't share your views
on this particular issue,'' Gore said told several thousand workers
at the Service Employees International Union convention in
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic Whip David Bonior of Michigan, a top Democratic
foe of the measure and a strong labor ally, kept up the pressure on
the dwindling band of undecided Democrats -- and expressed optimism
that the tide would turn in his direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're now within striking distance of defeating it,'' he told
a rally against the bill. ''While the advocates for the China trade
deal have been busy lining up support of Wall Street, we have been
reaching out all across this country to people on Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of labor unions prowled the halls of Congress
seeking last-minute converts.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to keep debate on the bill from becoming a
free-for-all, Republican leaders managed to deflect further
attempts to amend the China trade package, setting it up for a
straight up-and-down vote on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The House Rules Committee, which sets ground rules for debate,
did incorporate into the package two amendments agreed to earlier
by sponsors. One would set up a watchdog commission to monitor
human rights in China. The other would help protect U.S. industries
against surges in imports from China.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents were considering supporting a proposal by Rep. Howard
L. Berman, D-Calif., that would automatically end trade privileges
to China if Beijing attacked or set up a naval blockade of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   However, leaders sought ways to avoid such a vote from
happening.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Tigers 10, Indians 4  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Bobby Higginson and Dean Palmer keyed a six-run
Detroit fifth with consecutive home runs, leading the Tigers over
the Cleveland Indians 10-4 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Ramirez homered for the Indians, who have hit home runs in
14 straight games and were coming off a 7-2 homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Blair (2-0) relieved starter C.J. Nitkowski and gave up
one run and three hits in 3 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Bartolo Colon (4-2) lost for the first time in three starts
since coming back May 12 following a muscle strain. Colon was
tagged for six runs and nine hits in 4 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Colon issued successive walks to Higginson and Palmer in the
second and paid for it when Jose Macias hit a two-out smash back to
the mound that bounced off the heel of Colon's glove for an RBI
single.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit took a 3-0 lead in the third after Higginson, who
finished with four RBIs, hit a two-run double over Kenny Lofton in
center that drove in Gregg Jefferies and Juan Gonzalez, who both
had singled with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland got one back in the fourth when Roberto Alomar, who
had singled, scored on Jim Thome's double-play grounder.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians closed to 3-2 in the fifth when Enrique Wilson
singled up the middle past Nitkowski, scoring Ramirez, who had
reached on an error.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit broke it open with six runs and seven hits in the fifth,
sending 10 men to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Higginson's homer, a towering blow over the scoreboard in
right-center following a single by Gonzalez, gave Detroit a 5-2
lead. Palmer followed with another shot to right-center, and Jim
Brower relieved Colon.
</P>
<P>
   Brower gave up a run on a walk and three singles without getting
an out and was relieved by Tom Martin with bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez made it 9-3 with his second homer, a two-out solo shot
in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferies had an RBI double in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Nitkowski gave up two runs and six hits in 4 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes@: Roberto Alomar extended his hitting streak to 15 games with
a double in the first. ... Cleveland loaded the bases later in the
fifth inning, but Blair relieved Nitkowski and struck out Manny
Ramirez, then got Travis Fryman on a fly to right to end the
threat. ... This was the third time the Tigers had hit successive
homers in a game, but the first at Comerica Park. ... The Indians'
streak of consecutive games with homers is two short of the club
record set in 1963. ... Sandy Alomar left limping in the sixth. He
seemed to grab his left leg while going from first to second on an
infield single by Lofton. ... Higginson crushed a pitch from Martin
in the sixth, but Lofton caught it on the warning track in the
deepest part of center. ... Brandon Villafuerte got the final out
of the game in his major league debut.

<HEADLINE> Forest Service, Snowbasin OK Swap  </HEADLINE>
By VANIA GRANDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A troubled land swap between the U.S.
Forest Service and Snowbasin ski resort -- a major venue for the
2002 Winter Olympics -- was approved on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sinclair Oil Corp. owner Earl Holding received 1,377 acres of
national forest land that he plans to develop at the base of his
resort in exchange for turning over 11,757 acres of scattered
parcels in northern Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Holding surrendered 847-acre Taylor Canyon, a popular hiking
area east of Ogden and key parcel that held up the deal when the
Forest Service discovered it would have to help a neighboring
landowner develop his land.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service refused to accept the condition and told
Holding to deliver Taylor Canyon with clear title.
</P>
<P>
   The snag was resolved when Holding agreed to reduce the value of
Taylor Canyon by $40,000 and purchase a $200,000 bond covering the
potential liability, the Forest Service said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal clears the way for construction of a day lodge and
skier service building at the base of Snowbasin.
</P>
<P>
   ''The trade represents a major investment by Sinclair in the
development of a world class, four-season resort,'' Snowbasin said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Snowbasin will be the venue for the Olympic downhill and Super-G
ski races for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   The resort has been trying to trade land with the Forest Service
for more than a decade. Holding needed the land to turn his ski
area into a year-round resort.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 10, Marlins 3  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire and Ray Lankford gave the St.
Louis Cardinals back-to-back homers for the 13th time this year,
one shy of the NL record, in a 10-3 victory over the Florida
Marlins on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit his major-league leading 19th homer leading off the
second against Ryan Dempster (5-3) and Lankford followed with his
eighth on the next pitch. Jim Edmonds added his 14th in the third
inning as the Cardinals hiked their major league-leading total to
92 while winning for the fifth time in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado hit back-to-back homers 14 times in 1997. The Seattle
Mariners set the major league record with 19 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has five homers in five games and 541 for his career,
seven behind Mike Schmidt, who is seventh. McGwire was playing his
200th career game at Busch Stadium, where he has 99 homers, 209
RBIs and 208 walks.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire also singled and scored in the fifth to beat an unusual
shift against four outfielders, with second baseman Luis Castillo
stationed in right and his position vacated.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Kile (7-2) allowed two runs and four hits and in eight
innings, while striking out a season-high 11. He also had a two-run
single after starting the season 0-for-20 at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Matheny added a two-run double in the fifth for the
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Dempster, who had won his previous four starts, gave up eight
runs and nine hits in five innings as his ERA rose from 2.74 to
3.61.
</P>
<P>
   Kile, who had struggled his last two starts, dominated after
allowing a home run to Mark Kotsay with one out in the first. He
allowed only one hit the next six innings, a leadoff double by
Cliff Floyd in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Kile allowed 12 runs in 11 2-3 innings during his previous two
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Millar homered in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Kile struck out 10 on April 25 against the Brewers. ...
Dempster, who struck out five and walked three, gave up eight
earned runs in 29 2-3 innings during his four-game winning streak.
... Castillo was 1-for-3 with a walk in the sixth and has reached
base in 12 straight games and 27 of 28 overall. ... The Cardinals
are 6-1 vs. the NL East, with the other five games against the
Phillies. ... St. Louis is 6-2 in games following off days and 6-1
on Tuesday. ... Cardinals starters have 24 victories, more than any
other staff. ... Kile is 6-2 against the Marlins. ... Matheny and
Eli Marrero are the only catching tandem in the majors without an
error.

<HEADLINE> Barak Backs Withdrawal, Blasts Syria  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Tuesday defended
Israel's Lebanon withdrawal, and accused regional power-broker
Syria of trying to sabotage the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Barak told Channel 1 television that he was so moved by the
homecoming of Israeli soldiers from Lebanon that it ''sent a shiver
down his spine.'' He said that was what made his decision to
withdraw the troops worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   And in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and key
world leaders, Barak said Syria has been cynically exploiting the
Palestinians in Lebanon ''to commit terrorist acts against Israel
after the withdrawal.''
</P>
<P>
   Syria is also providing a free hand to Iran and its Hezbollah
supporters ''to build infrastructures which would undermine
regional stability to the point of possible outbreak of
hostilities,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday, Barak ordered Israeli troops out of Lebanon
immediately -- two months ahead of schedule. He had said Tuesday
that Israel, post-withdrawal, ''as any other country in the world,
will not tolerate a situation in which its sovereign territory is
attacked and its citizens face constant life threatening
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak urged the secretary-general ''to put and keep Syria on
record on this issue, in order to prevent unnecessary deterioration
in regional stability in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   Syria has over 30,000 troops in Lebanon and is the real ruler
there. Israel regards Syria as responsible for Hezbollah attacks
partly because the guerrillas arms are all delivered from Iran
through Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Since Monday, Israeli-backed South Lebanese Army militia has
collapsed and the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah guerrillas have overrun
the strip of land Israel had occupied in south Lebanon to protect
its northern border against guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Barak told Channel One television the chaos will last only a
short time and ''when the dust settles in a few days'' the
withdrawal will end Israel's entanglement in Lebanon which has cost
the lives of over a thousand soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said it was the Israeli presence in Lebanon which created
the Hezbollah guerrilla group. Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 to
expel Palestinian guerrillas who had been harassing the Israeli
border in the previous decade. The Hezbollah group did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis expelled the PLO and its leader Yasser Arafat from
Beirut, but as the Israeli presence continued there was growing
resistance from Lebanese groups, notably Hezbollah, which was
trained and armed by Iran.
</P>
<P>
   He implied that Israel could have withdrawn from Lebanon years
ago but did not do so due to inertia. It took a government with the
determination to make a clean break to end the vicious circle, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli withdrawal was originally scheduled to be over by
July 7, but Barak said Tuesday it would be completed within ten
days. Barak announced early Wednesday that the final pullout had
begun and announced within hours that it was complete.

<HEADLINE> Angels 7, Twins 4  </HEADLINE>
By ARNIE STAPLETON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Mo Vaughn and Darin Erstad homered as the
Anaheim Angels chased Joe Mays early in beating the Minnesota Twins
7-4 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cooper (1-0), making his first major league start since
last Sept. 29, scattered five hits over six innings for his first
victory since Sept. 7 of last year, when he won his major league
debut against the Chicago White Sox at Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was recalled from Triple-A Edmonton on Monday when
right-hander Mark Petkovsek was placed on the 15-day disabled list
with viral syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Mays (1-6) gave up seven runs and seven hits in three-plus
innings. He walked three, including two with the bases loaded, and
surrendered homers to Vaughn (417 feet) and Erstad (411 feet).
</P>
<P>
   Mays almost didn't make it out of the first inning, when the
Angels batted around, scoring two runs on Tim Salmon's single and
two more on bases-loaded walks to Scott Spiezio and Bengie Molina.
</P>
<P>
   The first two outs of the inning were forceouts at home, and the
third was a foul ball run down by third baseman Ron Coomer while
Travis Miller was already warming up in the Twins' bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's 16th homer, an upper-deck shot, made it 5-0 in the
second inning, and Erstad led off the fourth with his seventh
homer.
</P>
<P>
   Mays was yanked after the next batter, Adam Kennedy, struck out
but reached first on May's wild pitch. Miller gave up an RBI double
to Garret Anderson, making it 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   David Ortiz's two-run double in the fourth made it 7-2 and Brian
Buchanan's first major league homer, a two-run, 415-foot shot off
Cooper, made it 7-4 in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins got consecutive one-out singles off Shigetoshi
Hasegawa in the eighth, but Buchanan grounded into a 6-4-3 double
play.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Percival pitched a perfect ninth for his AL-leading 13th
save.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Twins held a moment of silence for Timberwolves
swingman Malik Sealy, who was killed in a traffic accident last

<HEADLINE> U.S. Soldier Convicted in Germany  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIESSEN, Germany (AP) -- A Hesse state court on Tuesday convicted
a U.S. soldier of murder, rape and arson, sentencing him to life in
prison for an attack on three students last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Ryan Ziegler, 26, was convicted in the stabbing death of a
24-year-old male student, stabbing and raping a 24-year-old female
student, and stabbing and seriously injuring a 22-year-old male
student, before setting fire to the apartment they were in.
</P>
<P>
   Despite serious injuries including burns, the rape victim was
able to call police the early morning of Aug. 21 and Ziegler, of
Company B, 16th Engineer Battalion in Giessen, was arrested a short
time later.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court had to deal with an occurrence that is hardly
imaginable,'' Judge Holger Gassmann said of the trial that began on
April 26.
</P>
<P>
   Ziegler, whose hometown was unavailable, was described by
witnesses as well-liked with no signs of an aggressive nature. He
confessed to the crimes after his arrest, but had no explanation
for the sudden outburst of violence.
</P>
<P>
   A German psychiatrist who examined Ziegler also told the court
he could not establish a motive for the soldier's actions. He said
Ziegler's remorse over what he had done was genuine.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ziegler gave investigators a clear description of his
actions on the night of the crime, he was never able to recall what
he had done with the murder weapon.
</P>
<P>
   According to the court, he also stole a laptop computer and
wallets before setting the apartment on fire.
</P>
<P>
   German authorities took jurisdiction in the case because a U.S.
court could have sentenced Ziegler to death, which is banned in
Germany.

<HEADLINE> Christians Fear Security Vacuum  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA ABU-NASR
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALMA ESH-SHAAB, Lebanon (AP) -- On a day of widespread
celebration in predominantly Shiite Muslim south Lebanon, this
Christian village was eerily quiet Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shops were closed, streets were empty, and talk of liberation
from the departing Israeli army brought a look of worry to the
residents' faces.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are scared because it's a new situation,'' said the
Rev. Maroun Ghasri, a Maronite Catholic priest. ''But we are full
of hope that the government will not abandon us.''
</P>
<P>
   Alma esh-Shaab is one of a dozen Christian villages scattered
across the western sector of the south Lebanon buffer zone which
Israel and its South Lebanon Army allies are vacating after a
22-year occupation.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal and the disintegration of the SLA -- a
Christian-led militia with a slight Muslim majority -- has left a
power vacuum that the Shiite guerrillas of Hezbollah and Amal are
rushing to fill before U.N. peacekeeping troops or the Lebanese
army moves in. Both the U.N. and the Lebanese government say their
forces will make no moves until the last Israeli troops are gone.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of Shiite guerrillas has left many Christians, who
historically comprised 30 percent of the western sector's
population, worried that the guerrillas will try to hunt down
former SLA militiamen or their families. Many are trying to come to
terms with the sight of bearded Hezbollah guerrillas hanging out of
speeding cars bristling with weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In the mostly Christian eastern sector, Christians shared the
same apprehensions. Hundreds already have fled to the Israeli
border.
</P>
<P>
   ''In such a situation, it's normal to be afraid,'' the Rev.
Antoine Hayek, a Roman Catholic priest, said by interview from
Marjayoun, headquarters of the SLA. ''We're getting assurances from
the (Lebanese) government that it would protect us, and we're
hoping that these promises will help alleviate the people's
worries.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine days ago, in remarks directed at SLA militiamen, Hezbollah
chief Sheik Hassan Nasrallah had sworn: ''By God, we will enter
your homes and slaughter you in your beds.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, speaking at a news conference in Beirut, he sought
to reassure Christians in the south. ''You are our sons, our hearts
and our eyes,'' he said. ''We will be your parents and your
protectors.''
</P>
<P>
   Other leaders of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah made the rounds of
several Christian villages Tuesday, offering promises that their
guerrillas will not harm civilians who had stayed away from the
SLA. They stopped in Alma esh-Shaab, a village of 800 Christians,
where they had tea and a chat with several residents, including
Ghasri.
</P>
<P>
   Ghasri and other Christian clergymen have taken a leading role
in talking to SLA militiamen about the future. Ghasri said he
gathered some militiamen Monday night and told them that those who
were fearful of their fates ''should take some action.'' About 100
of them subsequently surrendered to the Lebanese army, while an
unspecified number fled to Israel, Ghasri said.
</P>
<P>
   The priest also called Alma esh-Shaab's residents for a meeting
to listen to their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told them, 'We're Lebanese. We've been in this country for
ages. There's no reason for fear,''' Ghasri said.
</P>
<P>
   In Ein Ibl, another Christian village, the residents watched as
jubilant Hezbollah armed fighters drove down the streets, their
cars decked with the party's yellow flags.
</P>
<P>
   ''So far, the situation has been quiet,'' said the Rev. Elie
Barakat, a Maronite priest. ''But people are scared of the security
vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   Many agree.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our joy will be complete with the presence of the government
in our midst -- even an oppressive government,'' said Yousef
Khreish, who works at the local tobacco company.
</P>
<P>
   Ein Ibl's mayor, Sobhi al-Amoudi, voiced the fears of many:
''The situation is not reassuring,'' he said. ''If someone wants to
take revenge, what's there to stop him in the absence of the
government?''

Israel Withdraws From Lebanon
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   METULLA, Israel (AP) -- Israeli troops evacuated their remaining positions in
south Lebanon before dawn Wednesday, carrying out an unexpectedly hasty
withdrawal that ended one of the most divisive chapters in Israel's history. The
final pullout began with departing troops blowing up most remaining positions
after Prime Minister Ehud Barak ordered the evacuation, leaving the border
region to Shiite Muslim guerrillas who have been rapidly filling the power
vacuum. Barak initially planned to begin the pullback only several days from
now. However, his hand was forced when the South Lebanon Army militia, Israel's
ally, rapidly disintegrated.

United Owner Buying US Airways
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The owner of United Airlines, ranked No. 1 in the world, has
agreed to buy US Airways, which is the world's 10th-largest, according to a
source familiar with the talks. The boards of both UAL Corp. and US Airways
Group Inc. have approved the deal, the source said on condition of anonymity.
The combination will create an airline behemoth with 6,500 flights a day and
hubs on both coasts; in contrast, the world's No. 2 carrier, American Airlines,
offers but 3,600 daily flights. Details of the acquisition were not immediately
known, but the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site today, citing
sources familiar with the deal, that UAL Corp. will pay $4.3 billion in cash and
assume $7.3 billion in debt and long-term leases.

caused. The flag will come down July 1. ''Today, we bring this debate to an

<HEADLINE> NTSB Working on Pa. Plane Wreck  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER NEWTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) -- Crash investigators retrieved the
engines and propeller assemblies Tuesday from a plane that crashed
on a remote mountainside over the weekend while carrying gamblers
home from a trip to Atlantic City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A team of forensic investigators also arrived from across the
country to help identify the remains of the 19 people killed in
Sunday's crash.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board officials hired
construction workers to lay thousands of pounds of gravel atop a
rain-soaked dirt road that snakes near the site of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery vehicles made their way up the winding roads,
through miles of thick forests of northeastern Pennsylvania late
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The study of the engines is something we want to do at the
manufacturers' assembly plant. They have the tools,'' NTSB
investigator Frank Hilldrup said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The engines are bound for a Honeywell plant in Phoenix, Hilldrup
said. The cockpit voice recorder box, which officials say did not
record any sound, is to be sent to a Fairchild Inc. plant in
Florida. Hilldrup did not know where the propellers would be sent.
</P>
<P>
   He also did not know how long it would take for the last of the
wreckage to be removed from the crash site.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation will enter a phase that could take several
months and will include a sound analysis of the air traffic control
tower's tape, which could reveal background noises on the plane
that could provide more clues.
</P>
<P>
   The Executive Airlines twin-engine turboprop crashed in the rain
nine miles south of the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport
Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots declared an emergency situation soon after missing their
first approach of an airport runway. Just before the second
approach, the pilots said they had lost both engines and the plane
crashed a short time later.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have yet to release the names of the victims.
Officials said the names would be released as each is positively
identified.

<HEADLINE> Unions, Lobbyists Aid Democrats  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Democratic National Committee expects to
set a one-day fund-raising record Wednesday, taking in more than
$23 million thanks in part to unions, lobbyists and others with
issues before the government. The total will beat the Republicans'
$21.5 million of last month.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, congressional Republicans, holding their annual
dinner a few blocks away the same night, plan to set a fund-raising
record of their own with more than $11 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ten unions have come up with $500,000 each for the Democrats'
Gala Tribute to President Clinton -- double the quarter-million
level that has been the recent standard for both parties.
</P>
<P>
   They include:
</P>
<P>
   -- The American Federation of Teachers and the National Education
Association, two teacher unions that oppose taxpayer-financed
vouchers to send children to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Communications Workers of America and the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. Congressional
Republicans have introduced legislation to do away with federal
rules that allow ''closed shops'' in which all employees at a
unionized company must join the bargaining unit.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 20 groups or individuals have agreed to raise or
contribute $250,000, including lobbyist Thomas Hale Boggs Jr., who
has represented the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, which
has fought efforts to limit product liability lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Boggs' list of clients also have included MCI Worldcom, which is
seeking federal approval to merge with Sprint, and US Airways.
Congress and the administration have pressured airlines to improve
service.
</P>
<P>
   Three trial lawyers have given or raised at least $250,000 each:
Peter Angelos, owner of the Baltimore Orioles; Fred Baron and Stan
Chesley. All are longtime givers to the Democratic Party. Trial
lawyers have increased their Democratic donations partly in
response to the candidacy of Republican George W. Bush, who
successfully championed legislation to restrict liability lawsuits
as Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   In a preview of the gala, Clinton thanked about 60 of the
party's biggest donors for raising the money that he said will put
Al Gore and the Democrats on even footing with the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''What you've given the vice president is, I think, inestimable
and I'm grateful to you for that,'' Clinton said Tuesday night at a
dinner at the MCI Center, the setting for Wednesday's gala.
</P>
<P>
   He added that, ''We need to spend this money in the wisest
possible way to make sure that all the work we've done in the last
eight years is not squandered, but instead built upon.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also attended the dinner, where he schmoozed and posed for
pictures with some of those in the crowd, which including Clinton
fund-raiser Terence McAuliffe, Gore campaign chairman Tony Coelho
and Beth Dozoretz, who raised or contributed $500,000 for
Wednesday's tribute.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats sold out a downtown Washington sports arena for
the gala that will include performances by Stevie Wonder, Lenny
Kravitz and Robin Williams. Tickets went for as little as $50,
barbecue is on the menu, and blue jeans the suggested dress.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're not going to see goat cheese here,'' Democratic
National Committee spokeswoman Jenny Backus said. ''You're going to
see good old-fashioned blue jeans, cowboy boots and barbecue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have raised so much money that they are going to
break the one-day record of $21.5 million set just last month at
the Republican National Committee's own annual gala, featuring
Bush, the presumptive GOP nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few blocks away at the Washington Convention Center,
House and Senate Republicans expect a record, too. Rep. Rob
Portman, R-Ohio, chairman of the annual Senate-House dinner, said
the affair will raise more than $11 million, surpassing last year's
$8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Helping to raise money for the congressional Republicans will be
former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, the party's 1996
presidential nominee. While not a lobbyist himself, Dole works for
the powerhouse firm of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and
Hand. The firm has represented BellSouth, which is seeking
permission to carry data over long-distance lines, Citigroup, which
is pushing to overhaul bankruptcy laws, and General Motors, which

<HEADLINE> Knicks Have Nothing Left After Miami  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Patrick Ewing muscled into the lane for a
shot he has put up so many times before. His mind told him it was
time to leave the floor. His body wouldn't listen.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, his feet barely above the court, was an easy mark for
Indiana's Dale Davis, who swatted the shot away. That
fourth-quarter sequence epitomized a team that didn't leave its
heart in Miami, but failed to bring its legs to the Eastern
Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Dragging after a brutal second-round series with Miami, the
Knicks couldn't complete their comeback from a 19-point deficit in
Game 1 Tuesday night, falling to a more rested Pacers team 102-88.
</P>
<P>
   New York kept making runs at Indiana, but lacked a finishing
punch after beating the Heat on the road in Game 7 of that
emotional series just two days earlier. The Pacers, who needed six
games to beat Philadelphia in the previous round, came into the
conference finals with benefit of a four-day break.
</P>
<P>
   It showed.
</P>
<P>
   New York still seemed to be suffering from jet lag when the game
opened, falling behind 35-17 at the end of the first quarter and
going down 42-23 early in the second. Ewing had been virtually
invisible to that point, but he somehow mustered the energy to get
the Knicks back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old center scored 11 points during a 20-6 spurt that
closed the gap to a mere 52-48 at halftime, stunning the rowdy
Conseco Fieldhouse crowd. Latrell Sprewell hit a 13-footer to open
the second half and, suddenly, the Knicks were within a basket of
tying things up for the first time since the opening tip.
</P>
<P>
   But, like a boxer jabbing his way out of trouble, the Pacers
kept New York away throughout the crucial third quarter. Then,
Indiana delivered the knockout to its weary opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell led the Knicks with 22 points, but only one came in the
final quarter. Ewing scored just three of his 21 points in the last
12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   New York can only hope they find their legs before Game 2, just
two days away.

<HEADLINE> Fijian Chiefs Support President  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Tribal chiefs said Tuesday that they
sympathize with the views of gunmen who are holding members of the
ethnic Indian-led government hostage, but the chiefs threw their
support to Fiji's president, who has condemned the gunmen and
demanded the captives' release.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting of the Great Council of Chiefs came on the fifth day
of a crisis that began when gunmen -- angry that ethnic Indians have
power in this majority Fijian nation -- stormed parliament and took
Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and other leaders hostage.
</P>
<P>
   As the council met, about 60 men continued to hold Chaudhry and
at least 20 members of his Cabinet and governing coalition inside
the parliament grounds in Suva, the capital. There were reports
that ethnic Indian property was being looted and burned by mobs of
masked men.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the parliament, meanwhile, police conducted a low-key
siege, manning roadblocks but rarely stopping people who entered
the parliament grounds to show their support for the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   George Speight, the rebel leader, has declared himself prime
minister and installed what he calls an interim government. But
President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara is not among the hostages, and on
Tuesday the chiefs gave Mara their backing to run the government
for now.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has little legislative power, the chiefs' council
retains moral authority over indigenous Fijians, who for centuries
were ruled by hereditary chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The chiefs are in support of the president and they do not
approve of what Speight has done, although there is a lot of
sympathy for the views expressed by his followers,'' said Sitiveni
Rabuka, the council's president.
</P>
<P>
   The chiefs were meeting Wednesday to consider Speight's main
demand -- changes to the constitution to entrench indigenous Fijians
in power. The chiefs will also decide whether they think Speight
should escape prosecution for his role in the uprising, Rabuka
said.
</P>
<P>
   While Rabuka said he was optimistic the crisis would end
Wednesday, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said late
Tuesday he feared it would be a peaceful conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're deeply concerned about the risk of bloodshed. It's an
extremely ugly and unacceptable situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, up to 2,000 supporters of Speight and his gunmen
gathered inside the parliament grounds and held a quiet rally that
was reminiscent of a family barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   Men sat crossed-legged on mats of woven leaves, slowly clapping
their hands and gulping yaqona -- a drink made from crushed plants
that is a mild sedative. Nearby, a slaughtered pig cooked whole in
a lovo, a hole in the ground filled with fire-heated rocks and
covered with earth.
</P>
<P>
   But overlooking the scene stood men with automatic rifles --
participants in Speight's coup bid.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters offered Speight yaqona, sang traditional Fijian songs
with him and thanked him for what they said was protecting their
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Give Fiji back to the Fijians to rule,'' said one woman who
asked not to be named. ''Give us a Fijian government.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Indians -- descendants of indentured labor brought to the
islands by British colonizers to work as cane cutters -- make up 44
percent of the population of 813,000 on this cluster of South
Pacific islands 2,250 miles east of Australia. Indigenous Fijians
are 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many Fijians resent that Indo-Fijians have come to dominate
commerce, managing or operating industries such as sugarcane
growing and clothes manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   For thousands of years before English colonization, Fijians were
ruled by a complex structure of tribal chiefs and lords, and most
Fijians retain elements of a traditional lifestyle. They identify
themselves by region and clan, and men often go barefoot and wear
kilt-like skirts called sulu.
</P>
<P>
   Indo-Fijian men usually wear standard Western clothes. Women
sometimes wear traditional Indian garments.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry, elected last year, is Fiji's first ethnic Indian prime
minister.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Tuesday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Indians-Tigers:
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: Injuries to starters Jaret Wright and Charles Nagy
and reliever Ricardo Rincon have forced some moves. RHP Tim Drew
was promoted from Double-A Akron to start Wednesday night's game
against the Tigers, his major league debut. Drew, the Indians' No.
1 pick in 1997's amateur draft, was 3-2 with a 2.42 ERA at Akron.
The 21-year-old Drew is younger brother of St. Louis outfielder
J.D. Drew.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: The Tigers hope RHP Jeff Weaver, who will oppose Drew,
has better luck than he did last time out against the Indians.
Weaver had allowed just two hits and struck out three through three
innings Thursday at Cleveland. And the Tigers had a 5-0 lead when
the game was called because of rain. The forecast? Rain possible.
Mariners-Orioles:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: DH Edgar Martinez began Tuesday with 50 RBIs, matching
his first-half total from last year. ... LF Rickey Henderson has 12
career home runs in Baltimore, but only three have come at Camden
Yards, which opened in 1992. ... LHP Arthur Rhodes, who pitched for
the Orioles from 1991-99, visited former teammates in the Baltimore
clubhouse before the game.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: The Orioles have three players with 350 or more
career home runs -- Cal Ripken (409), Harold Baines (376) and Albert
Belle (363). Baltimore is the first team that can make that claim
since the 1974 Detroit Tigers featured Al Kaline (399), Norm Cash
(377) and Frank Howard (382). ... A persistent drizzle canceled
batting practice Tuesday. However, four ducks that perched on the
tarp over the pitcher's mound didn't seem to mind. ... 2B Delino
DeSheields, who had 11 stolen bases in 96 games last year, already
has 15 this season.
Blue Jays-Red Sox:
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: Craig Grebeck extended his hitting streak to nine games
with a first-inning single. Shannon Stewart extended his streak to
seven games. ... The Blue Jays sent LHP Eric Gunderson outright to
Syracuse of the International League. ... Chris Carpenter has faced
Pedro Martinez in consecutive starts.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: Martinez had a streak of 17 scoreless innings snapped
when Toronto scored once in the first. It was the first time
Martinez surrendered a first-inning run since Aug. 8, 1999. ...
With 32 strikeouts in his previous two starts, Martinez tied Louis
Tiant, Nolan Ryan and Randy Johnson for the most strikeouts in
consecutive games by an AL pitcher. Kerry Wood holds the major
league mark with 33.
Athletics-Devil Rays:
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: DH John Jaha, on the disabled list with a left shoulder
strain, accompanied the team for the start of a nine-game road
trip. He will work out and take batting practice daily before being
re-evaluated after the Devil Rays series. ... The A's won nine of
10 games against Tampa Bay last season, including all four the
teams played at Tropicana Field. ... Wednesday was the 99th
anniversary of Nap Lajoie receiving the AL's first-ever intentional
walk with the bases loaded in a game against Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: After playing 24 of their previous 33 games on the
road, the Devil Rays were happy to be home for the start of a
10-game homestand ... RHP Jim Mecir was activated from the 15-day
disabled list and RHP Cory Lidle was optioned to Triple-A Durham.
... LHP Tony Saunders, who broke his pitching arm last May, threw
35 pitches in batting practice and continues to progress. ... A
decision could be forthcoming on LHP Wilson Alvarez, who hasn't
pitched this season because of a sore left shoulder. Manager Larry
Rothschild said he has made little or no progress in recent
workouts. Earlier this month, Alvarez said he needs surgery to
repair wear and tear on the rotator cuff, but that he hoped to
delay the procedure until after the season.
Rangers-Royals:
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: INF Tom Evans had surgery on his right shoulder Tuesday
and is out for the season. Dr. James Andrews performed the
operation in Birmingham, Ala. Evans, 25, had a small tear in the
rotator cuff of his throwing shoulder and also a labral tear. The
Rangers expect him to be ready for spring training in 2001. Texas
opened a three-city, nine-game road trip, with three games each in
Kansas City, Minnesota and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: RF Jermaine Dye may be back Thursday. The AL's
player of the month for April, Dye hurt his knee last Saturday
while making a catch against the wall in Anaheim. Doctors said the
knee had become infected. He is expected to miss at least four
games. The Royals are coming off a 6-6 road trip after going 0-9
the last time they left home.
Angels-Twins:
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: The Angels began a nine-game road trip with Brian
Cooper on the mound. He made his first major league start since
last Sept. 29 against Oakland. Cooper was recalled from Triple A
Edmonton on May 22, replacing Mark Petkovsek, who was played on the
15-day DL with headaches, fever and dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: The Twins claimed 3B Casey Blake off waivers from the
Toronto Blue Jays and designated LHP Benj Sampson for release or
assignment. ... The Twins held a moment of silence for Timberwolves
swingman Malik Sealy, who was killed in a traffic accident
Saturday.
Yankees-White Sox:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Derek Jeter took about 30 grounders on Tuesday at the
Yankees' minor league complex in Tampa, Fla. He also took some easy
swings in the batting cage and ran the bases. He said he will
attempt to raise his workout level Friday. Yankees manager Joe
Torre said Tuesday he expects Jeter will need to play in a minor
league game before he's ready to return to the team, maybe by the
weekend. ... David Cone said any moves the Yankees make to bolster
their offense would not be unexpected. ''We know anything can
happen at any time,'' Cone said. ''The front office has a pretty
good track record. We'll let them do their job and worry about
getting some wins.'' ... Shane Spencer, who missed Sunday's game
with a sore hamstring, was available for pinch-hitting duties
Tuesday night and could be used as a DH some time in the series
with the White Sox. ... Chuck Knoblauch, who hurt a different area
of his bothersome left wrist while making a tag Sunday against
Cleveland, was in the starting lineup. He'd been forced to leave
Sunday's game in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Manager Jerry Manuel called it a difficult decision to
send rookie catcher Josh Paul to the minors Tuesday when the White
Sox activated catcher Brook Fordyce from the disabled list. ...
Paul is one of the fastest running catchers in the major leagues
and was hitting .258 in a platoon setup with Mark Johnson. ''Josh
caught two complete games and did everything extremely well, ''
Manuel said. But Fordyce, who broke a bone in his foot during a
spring training intrasquad game, hit .297 last season and at age 30
is a more experienced handler of pitchers. RHP Kip Wells, who had
control problems in his first stint with the White Sox (28 walks
and 28 strikeouts) also was called up and RHP Tanyon Sturtze was
designated for assignment. ... The White Sox are in the midst of a
38-game stretch in which they play the Yankees and Indians 22
times. Following a three-game series against the Yankees, the
Indians come to Comiskey Park for three.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Mets-Padres:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Robin Ventura's sacrifice bunt in the ninth inning of
Monday night's 1-0 loss to the Padres was his first since last July
4 against Atlanta. ... Ralph Kiner, a Mets broadcaster, was general
manager of the Pacific Coast League Padres from 1956-1960, after
his Hall of Fame playing career ended. Another Mets broadcaster has
a strong tie to San Diego. Bob Murphy is the younger brother of the
late Jack Murphy, for whom San Diego's stadium was once named. Jack
Murphy Stadium, affectionately known as ''The Murph,'' was renamed
in 1997 after Qualcomm contributed the necessary $18 million to
complete an expansion for the NFL's Chargers. ... Mets LHP Glendon
Rusch has lived up to his name by starting the Mets' four quickest
games of the season, including Monday night's game that lasted 2
hours, 18 minutes. The others have gone 1:57, 2:17 and 2:17. He is
0-3 with one no-decision in those games.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: Monday night's 1-0 win over the Mets was San Diego's
first victory by that score since beating the Chicago Cubs in a
rain-shortened, five-inning game at Wrigley Field on June 1. ...
Before Monday night, the Padres had been 0-10 this season when
scoring fewer than three runs in a game. ... RHP Steve Montgomery,
on the disabled list since March 27 with a strained shoulder, is
scheduled for a bullpen session on Wednesday. Montgomery was
projected to share the setup role with Donne Wall before getting
hurt. ... RHP Brian Boehringer, who made three starts before going
on the DL with a strained shoulder, could be activated on Friday.
When he comes back, he'll go to the bullpen.
Phillies-Astros:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Pat Burrell, the first selection in the 1998 June
draft, will report to the Phillies in time for Wednesday's game. He
hit .294 in 40 games at Triple-A Scranton. ... Curt Schilling,
Philadelphia's starter on Wednesday, had a 4-1 record against his
former Astros teammates in the Astrodome. He'll be pitching for the
first time in Enron Field. Schilling lost his last start against
the Astros 10-2.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker's best
explanation for the Astros' slump? ''I know that some of our guys
are going up there trying to hit a three-run home run with nobody
on base and throw a no-hitter with perfect pitches. The guys have
got to get past that. This team has just got to start playing up to
its capabilities. A lot of those guys are the same players that won
the championship the last few years.
Marlins-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: RHP Alex Fernandez will have his sore rotator cuff
examined this week by Dr. James Andrews in Birmingham, Ala., but
manager John Boles doesn't anticipate surgery. Fernandez missed the
entire 1998 season after undergoing surgery for the same problem.
''He's had one major surgery on that shoulder and I don't think
he'll do it again,'' Boles said. ... Tony Perez, special assistant
to GM Dave Dombrowski, will have his No. 24 jersey retired Saturday
in Cincinnati. ... Vladimir Nunez, who starts Wednesday, is 3-1
with an 0.82 ERA in four relief appearances and one start against
the Cardinals. He's 0-3 with a 7.77 ERA overall this season.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: The Cardinals left the leadoff slot empty until just
before game time so 2B Fernando Vina, who fouled a ball off a toe
on his right foot on Saturday, could test the injury. The second
toe was black and blue. ... The Cardinals are likely to bring back
RHP Alan Benes, on the comeback trail after missing more than two
seasons with two shoulder surgeries, as a reliever. Pitching coach
Dave Duncan said a decision whether to prepare him for starting or
relieving will come soon. Benes gave up 10 runs in 4 2-3 innings
for Triple-A Memphis in his last outing on Sunday, but Duncan
discounted that. ''The manager got thrown out in the fourth inning
for arguing balls and strikes. When you have to throw the ball in
the middle of the plate to get a strike and the wind's blowing out,
that's a bad combination.''
Cubs-Rockies:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: The Cubs purchased the contract of OF Raul Gonzalez
from Triple-A Iowa. Gonzalez takes the roster spot of 3B Shane
Andrews, who went on the DL Sunday retroactive to May 15 with a
strained lower back. ... Chicago manager Don Baylor said 1B Mark
Grace is just beginning light running and was at least 10 days away
from being back after going on the DL on May 11 with a strained
left hamstring. ... Three former Rockies -- Joe Giradi, Jeff Reed
and Eric Young and Baylor, who managed Colorado for six years --
returned to Coors Field as members of the Cubs. ...
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Rockies LHP Scott Karl threw a simulated game before
Tuesday's game. Karl, 1-2 with a 7.53 ERA will be available for
bullpen duty on Tuesday and Wednesday and will make his next
scheduled start on Saturday. ... Colorado manager Buddy Bell has
benched Darren Bragg, who is in the midst of a 2-for-25 slump, in
favor of Bubba Carpenter, who is coming off a two-run pinch home
run in Philadelphia on Sunday. Carpenter make his first start at
home and second as a Rockie. ... The Rockies have scored 13 of
their last 17 runs and 18 of their last 23 runs with two outs.
Braves-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Before Tuesday's game at County Stadium, the Braves
activated left-fielder Reggie Sanders and optioned RHP Steve Sisco
to Triple-A Richmond. Sanders sprained his left ankle on May 6, but
was in the lineup and batting seventh against the Brewers. ... This
week, the Braves are making their final appearances in the stadium
they called home from 1953-65. The Milwaukee Braves won the World
Series in 1957 and the NL pennant in 1958. They moved to Atlanta in
1966. ... Extra ushers were in the right-field bleachers near the
Braves' bullpen as John Rocker made his first appearance of the
year in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: RHP Jamey Wright, acquired from Colorado in the
offseason, made his Brewers debut on Tuesday. His catcher was Henry
Blanco, who was also in the Rockies organization last year before
they were traded to Milwaukee. ... Mark Loretta continues to be the
NL's best shortstop, with just two errors in 186 chances before
Tuesday's game. ... Milwaukee fan favorite and Braves broadcaster
Don Sutton took the l duties of turning the number on the Brewers'
countdown clock, which tracks the number of games before Miller
Park opens.
Pirates-Diamondbacks:
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Warren Morris led off -- his fourth time in the
leadoff spot Pittsburgh has had six different players lead off. ...
The Pirates have had at least one extra-base hit in each game this
year. Jason Kendall extended the streak to 43 with a first-inning
triple off starter Brian Anderson. ... They are 5-7 in Bank One
Ballpark, including 1-2 during a series early in April.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: 3B Matt Williams was activated from the DL, where he
had been since breaking his right foot during spring training. To
make roster room, the Diamondbacks optioned IF Danny Klassen to
Triple-A Tucson. ... RHP Armando Reynoso, who is 2-4 with a 6.64
ERA, is hobbled by a left hamstring pull and may be out of the
rotation for the time being. Reynoso's next scheduled start is
Saturday, but he will work out Wednesday afternoon, and manager
Buck Showalter said if Reynoso hasn't improved, either Mike Morgan,
Vicente Padilla or Nelson Figueroa would get the start against
Milwaukee. Padilla and Figueroa are with Tucson, Padilla just since
closer Matt Mantei was activated off the DL on Sunday. ... Minor
league RHP John Patterson, long considered a future starter, will
have surgery Thursday to repair the ligament in his right elbow.
The so-called ''Tommy John'' surgery has a recovery time of nine to
12 months. ... GM Joe Garagiola Jr. said he was close to signing
Greg Colbrunn to a $6 million, two-year contract extension. ''We
are in agreement on all the economic issues, but we've got some
contract-language issues that we're still discussing,'' Garagiola
said.
Reds-Dodgers
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: By giving up Eric Karros' game-tying sacrifice fly
in the 11th inning of Monday night's 14-inning, 4-3 loss to the
Dodgers, reliever Danny Graves squandered a chance to become the
first Reds pitcher to start a season 7-0 since Ron Robinson in
1986. But the right-hander's unblemished record is still alive
because the loss was charged to Manny Aybar. ... Entering Tuesday
night's game, the Reds were 10-1 when Ken Griffey Jr. homered and
14-19 when he didn't. ... The Reds will formally retire the No. 24
jersey of soon-to-be inducted Hall of Famer Tony Perez during
ceremonies preceding Saturday's game against Florida. Perez is an
executive with the Marlins, who are 1-15 against Cincinnati during
the last two seasons and in 1998 became the first team baseball's
oldest franchise has ever swept in a season series (9-0).
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: The Dodgers are still waiting to hear from the
Commissioner's office to see if Chad Kreuter or any other Dodgers
personnel will be reprimanded for going into the Wrigley Field
stands on May 16 and defending themselves against some physically
abusive Cubs fans. Reliever Mike Fetters is concerned that any
suspensions or fines levied at Dodgers players would set a
dangerous precedent. ''By punishing the players, I think it's going
to open a can or worms for more fans to do the same thing -- knowing
that we're going to get in trouble for them instigating what goes
on in there,'' Fetters said Tuesday. ''I mean, no player should go
up in the stands. But if something is done to us by major league
baseball, then I think more fans are going to do it because they
know we're the ones who are going to get in trouble -- not them. And
without better security, that's what's going to happen.'' ... The
X-rays Dr. Frank Jobe took Tuesday of Gary Sheffield's sprained
right ankle were negative, and Sheffield expects to return to the
lineup on Friday night. Sheffield entered the clubhouse Tuesday
without the crutches he left with on Monday night following his
painful takeout slide at second base against Cincinnati's Pokey
Reese. ''The way he put the X-rays up on the board,'' Sheffield
said, ''I thought there was something really wrong -- because he
kept looking at them and said 'Come over here and sit on the
table.' So it kind of scared me a little bit. But he said I just
pulled the ligaments again and stretched them out even more than I
did before (in New York).''
Expos-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: LHP Steve Kline leads the major leagues with 26
appearances entering play on Tuesday. He's on pace to appear in 103
games. He's not worried about it. ''I was a starter in the minors
and threw 150-200 innings a year,'' he said. ''Now I'm only working
70 innings. I don't throw 100 miles an hour. Mainly my stuff is
slop. I'm sure I'll get a break.'' Kline appeared in 82 games last
year, and 78 in 1998. He hasn't allowed a run in his last 15
appearances dating back to April 25 innings. That's the longest
scoreless streak of his career. ''When you're pitching good, you
want to keep pitching,'' said Kline. ''When you're pitching bad,
you want to find the nearest exit as soon as possible.'' ... RHP
Ugueth Urbina visited Dr. James Andrews in Birmingham, AL on Monday
to get a second opinion on his injured right elbow, which required
arthroscopic surgery last week. Urbina showed a good range of
motion and is on schedule to begin a rehab program. ... RHP J.D.
Smart had arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: OF Ellis Burks is on schedule to be activated
from the disabled list before Wednesday's game against the Expos.
He's expected to be in the lineup. ''We have to get Ellis back,''
Giants manager Dusty Baker said. Burks has been on the DL since May
13 with a strained left quadriceps muscle. The Giants will make a
parallel move prior to game time on Wednesday. OF Terrell Lowery,
called up to take Burks' place, will make the decision tough on the
Giants. He's hitting .632 (12-for-19) in six games since his
recall. ''Why does everybody assume it's going to be him?'' asked
Baker. ''Everybody has told him except us.'' ... The Giants play
their next 24 games within the state of California, including 18 at
Pac Bell Park.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Missouri-Kansas City has fired head
basketball coach Bob Sundvold, the university announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sundvold, who has spent the last four seasons at UMKC, was
released as coach and will not be reassigned to other duties,
athletics director Bob Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made this decision after considering the best interests of
UMKC and its men's basketball program in both the near-term and
long-term future,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Sundvold had two years left on his contract. He signed a
five-year deal when he was hired in 1996 and a one-year extension
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really devastated,'' Sundvold told KMBC-TV Tuesday night.
''This comes as a complete shock. ... I didn't have an inkling they
were interested in making a change.''
</P>
<P>
   The school, which has scheduled a news conference for Wednesday,
said a search for a new coach will begin immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The Kangaroos were 43-70 under Sundvold, including 16-13 last
season when they finished tied for second in the Mid-Continent
conference, their first winning record since the 1991-92 season.
</P>
<P>
   Sundvold was head coach at Central Missouri State before
succeeding Lee Hunt as coach at UMKC. He was also an assistant at
South Dakota State, Missouri and Southwest Missouri State.

<HEADLINE> Primaries in Ark., Ky., and Idaho  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   A crowded field of Arkansas Democrats hoping to challenge
embattled GOP Rep. Jay Dickey in the fall were forced into a runoff
on Tuesday, while two Idaho Republicans battled over which is the
rightful heir to ultraconservative Rep. Helen Chenoweth-Hage.
</P>
<P>
   With 90 percent of precincts in Arkansas reporting, state Sen.
Mike Ross was the leading vote-getter, with 43 percent, or 35,050
votes. Second-place was less clear: former TV reporter Dewayne
Graham had 24 percent, or 19,409 votes, while former state Rep.
Judy Smith, who lost to Dickey in 1998, had 21 percent, or 17,255
votes. A fourth candidate got 12 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid a runoff, the winner had to get more than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky also held congressional primaries, and all three states
had presidential contests made meaningless because Al Gore and
George W. Bush have already wrapped up their parties' nominations.
</P>
<P>
   In Idaho, four-term Lt. Gov. Butch Otter led in very early
returns in his bid to succeed Chenoweth-Hage.
</P>
<P>
   With only 3 precincts reporting, Otter, a millionaire
businessman, led with 53 percent, or 229 votes, to 22 percent, or
94 votes, for Dennis Mansfield, who founded the religious right
group Idaho Family Forum with Chenoweth-Hage. The two led a field
of eight Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republican leaders in the heavily GOP state back Otter.
Chenoweth-Hage did not endorse anyone, but did not object to a
national term limits organization's ads linking her politics to
Mansfield's.
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield, who focuses on social and moral issues, is a staunch
opponent of abortion. Otter opposes abortion but says he takes a
more libertarian approach that keeps government out of people's
lives, and prefers to talk about land rights issues and gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   The winner will face Democrat Linda Pall, a Moscow City Council
member, and candidates from the Libertarian and Reform parties.
</P>
<P>
   Chenoweth-Hage built her career on her opposition to big
government and what she called environmental extremism. Her remarks
after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing were viewed as sympathetic to
the militia. She also once claimed that minorities don't like
northern Idaho because it's too cold.
</P>
<P>
   In President Clinton's home state, none of the candidates hoping
to challenge Dickey made his vote for impeachment an issue, though
Dickey said he expected it to come up in the campaign. GOP Rep. Asa
Hutchinson -- one of the House prosecutors in Clinton's trial --
faced no opposition from either party.
</P>
<P>
   Dickey is seeking his fifth term in the traditionally Democratic
district, which includes Clinton's hometowns of Hope and Hot
Springs. Dickey, who has no Republican opposition, was criticized
this year after he told black farmers he could do little for their
efforts to seek federal help for discrimination because they didn't
support him politically. He later mended fences with one group of
farmers who recently endorsed him.
</P>
<P>
   In Kentucky, state Rep. Eleanor Jordan defeated two lesser-known
candidates to win the Democratic nomination to challenge two-term
GOP Rep. Anne Northup in a district that is 2-1 Democratic. Jordan,
the only black woman in the state Legislature, hopes to become
Kentucky's first black member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Northup had no opposition in the primary.

<HEADLINE> Elian Expected To Move to DC Estate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez, his father and their Cuban
entourage are expected to move from their secluded quarters in
Maryland to an estate in the heart of the nation's capital,
possibly by the end of this week, The Washington Post reported.
</P>
<P>
   The group is expected to move to an estate owned by Youth For
Understanding International Exchange, an international student
exchange group, the Post said on its Web site Tuesday. The 6.5-acre
estate is located in the Cleveland Park section of northwest
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope that by providing the Gonzalez family with shelter and
hospitality in Washington's most historic residence, we can
demonstrate to the family and to the citizens of Cuba that the
American people bear them no ill will,'' Youth For Understanding
said in a statement quoted by the Post.
</P>
<P>
   The Gonzalezes and their entourage have been under the
protection of the U.S. Marshals Service at the Carmichael Farm on
the edge of the Wye River Conference Center since April 25.
</P>
<P>
   If the group moves, the marshals will go with them to provide
security and make sure Elian doesn't leave the country in violation
of a federal court order, the newspaper said, quoting unidentified
government officials.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays' Eiland Injured in Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Tampa Bay's Dave Eiland left Tuesday
night's game against Oakland in the first inning after injury a hip
during a pitch to the Athletics' Randy Velarde and falling to the
ground in pain.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays said Eiland pinched the bursa sac in his left
hip. The right-hander was unable to put any weight on his leg as he
was helped off the field and was immediately placed on the 15-day
disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Right-handed reliever Cory Lidle, optioned to Triple-A Durham
earlier in the day when Jim Mecir was activated from the DL, was
recalled to fill Eiland's spot.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde was the second batter of the game. Eiland, who threw 12
pitches, retired leadoff man Terrence Long on a fly ball to center
and went down as he followed through on his fourth pitch to
Velarde.
</P>
<P>
   Eiland said he initially felt pain on the pitch before he fell
but wanted to see if he could pitch through the discomfort. It was
the sixth time in 19 starts since June 7 when the right-hander has
left with an injury.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Rekar replaced Eiland, who spent time on the DL last
season with left hip bursitis, and went on to beat the A's 6-4.

<HEADLINE> Bengals Extend Anderson Contract  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Offensive tackle Willie Anderson has agreed to
a six-year contract extension, the Cincinnati Bengals said Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson already was committed for this year, so the new deal
goes through the 2006 season.
</P>
<P>
   Terms were not released. A story on the Bengals' Web site
speculated that the deal was worth $31 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a key signing for the future of our team,'' coach
Bruce Coslet said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've talked a lot recently about how important it is to
solidify our offensive line. You don't just need good players, you
need players who play together over a number of years and form a
cohesive unit.
</P>
<P>
   ''But with Willie, it goes beyond that. To me, he epitomizes
what being a team guy is about, just in the way he conducts himself
and goes about his business.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was the Bengals' first-round draft pick in 1996, and
the 10th pick overall.

United Owner Buying US Airways
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The owner of United Airlines, ranked No. 1 in the world, has
agreed to buy US Airways, which is the world's 10th-largest, according to a
source familiar with the talks. The boards of both UAL Corp. and US Airways
Group Inc. have approved the deal, the source said on condition of anonymity.
The combination will create an airline behemoth with 6,500 flights a day and
hubs on both coasts; in contrast, the world's No. 2 carrier, American Airlines,
offers but 3,600 daily flights. Details of the acquisition were not immediately
known, but the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site Tuesday, citing
sources familiar with the deal, that UAL Corp. will pay $4.3 billion in cash and
assume $7.3 billion in debt and long-term leases.

Israel Makes Hasty Lebanon Withdrawal

   METULLA, Israel (AP) -- Israel pulled the last of its troops out of south
Lebanon at daybreak Wednesday, carrying out an unexpectedly hasty withdrawal
that ended one of the most divisive chapters in Israel's history. The final
pullout began with departing troops blowing up most remaining position after
Prime Minister Ehud Barak ordered the evacuation, leaving the border region to
Shiite Muslim guerrillas who have been rapidly filling the power vacuum. The
last Israeli troops to leave Lebanon crossed into the Jewish state at 6:41 a.m.
Wednesday.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft returns to court Wednesday, hoping to get an

Microsoft will face a bevy of government attorneys during a hearing scheduled
before U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who oversaw the 78-day
antitrust trial in a case brought by the Justice Department and 19 state
attorneys general. Last month, Jackson ruled that Microsoft violated federal
antitrust law by using illegal methods to protect its monopoly in the computer

<HEADLINE> Stars 3, Avalanche 2, OT  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Joe Nieuwendyk is once again coming through for
the Dallas Stars when they need him the most.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk re-directed a long blast from Richard Matvichuk 12:10
into overtime Tuesday night, giving the Dallas Stars a 3-2 victory
over the Colorado Avalanche and putting the Stanley Cup champions
within a win of returning to the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had some good luck there,'' Nieuwendyk said. ''It seemed
like the only way to get to the net is to outrace a guy. I was able
to do that and just got my stick on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Niewuendyk beat rookie Martin Skoula to get just enough of the
puck to send it past Colorado goalie Patrick Roy, giving Dallas a
3-2 lead in the best-of-seven Western Conference finals. Game 6 is
Thursday night in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk was the MVP of the playoffs last year after tying an
NHL record with six postseason game-winners, two of them in
overtime. It was only fitting then that he ended Dallas' first
overtime game of these playoffs, notching his second game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   His goal was the Stars' first this series that came without
Brett Hull, Mike Modano or Jere Lehtinen on the ice. The trio came
up big in the second period, though, as Lehtinen and Hull each
scored and Modano assisted on both.
</P>
<P>
   Stars goalie Ed Belfour also had another outstanding night,
stopping 29 shots. He's made 105 saves in three games and has yet
to allow the Avalanche to score more than twice in a game.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got a strong focus,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
''He has to be the difference for us if we expect to beat
Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour played his best when time was running out. He blocked
five shots during a power play in the final minutes of regulation,
then in overtime turned away Joe Sakic on a breakaway and handled a
three-shot flurry from Sakic and Dave Andreychuk. Andreychuk
chopped his stick at the ice in frustration when it ended.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's my job, to come up with the big saves,'' said Belfour,
who has won 10 of his last 11 home playoff games. ''I got a couple
of saves there, I got maybe a little lucky, and we needed that.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy, who allowed four goals in the first 11 shots in Game 4,
failed to protect a 1-0 lead and had some shaky moments. He was
solid in overtime, turning away strong shots from Hull, Modano and
Sylvain Cote before the bouncing finale got past him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It deflected right in front of me and I made the save
sideways,'' Roy said. ''After that, I saw the puck hit the post and
then cross the line.''
</P>
<P>
   When these teams met in the conference finals last season,
Colorado went home for Game 6 leading 3-2 only to see Dallas win in
seven games. Now the Avalanche, coming off their first consecutive
losses since mid-March, will try doing the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to keep playing hard and keep putting pucks at the
net,'' Avalanche coach Bob Hartley said. ''We had a lot of chances,
especially in overtime. We have to find a way to play better
hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still confident,'' said Sakic, who hasn't scored this
series and has just two goals in 15 playoff games. ''We've got to
keep doing the same things and maybe they'll go in.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's power play remained stuck in neutral. The Avalanche
went 0-for-4 for the second straight game, making them 1-for-18
over the last three games.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first overtime game of the series, which is
surprising considering four of the five regular-season meetings
went beyond the third period. Colorado won three and there was a
tie.
</P>
<P>
   This also was the first overtime game this postseason for
Dallas, which last summer had eight, including two triple-overtime
games.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado led 1-0 midway through the first period when Jon Klemme
flicked a rebound over Belfour. Milan Hejduk tied it at 2 by
scoring on a great feed from Sakic 2:19 into the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen tied it early in the second period by controlling a
rebound and backhanding it past Roy. Hull made it 2-1 late in the
period by blasting in a one-timer on a power play.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a howitzer,'' said Hull, who moved into the lead for
postseason points with 19 and tied Modano for the playoff lead in
goals with eight.
</P>
<P>
   Hull -- whose father, Hall of Famer Bobby Hull, watched from a
rink-level walkway -- also tied former New York Islanders star Mike
Bossy for fifth place on the career postseason list with 85 goals.
</P>
<P>
   The save of the game was made by Matvichuk, who in the first
period reached from outside the crease to swat away a shot by Shjon
Podein just before it crossed the goal line. Belfour had come out
to play the puck after failing to catch a long shot, then made a
poor pass straight to Podein and fell trying to get the puck back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went to play the puck and then I thought he was going to
play it,'' Belfour said. ''We just got mixed up and I whiffed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas lost a key player when Jamie Langenbrunner went down with
a knee injury in the first period. He's expected to miss Game 6 and
will likely be replaced by rookie Jon Sim, who has yet to play this
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's first-period goal was the first allowed by the Stars
in 13 home playoff games, setting an NHL record.
